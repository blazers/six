<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Audley,  Thomas</span>, Baron Audley of Walden  (1487/8&#150;1544), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born at Hay House, Earls Colne, Essex, the son of Geoffrey Audley, administrator, of Berechurch, Essex. At an unknown date he was sent to Buckingham College, Cambridge, which he re-established as Magdalene College in April 1542. On 7 July 1510 he was admitted to the Inner Temple, and he served as autumn reader there in 1526. He was reader again in April 1530. He was also a master of the bench and as late as 1530 still had chambers at the temple.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In 1514 Audley became town clerk of Colchester, a post he held jointly for the first year with John Barnaby, and then by himself until he resigned it in 1532. About 1519 he married Christina (<i>d</i>. 1538), daughter of Sir Thomas Barnardiston of Kedington, Suffolk, and his wife, Elizabeth. They had no children. Audley was first appointed JP for Essex in November 1520, and was named repeatedly to that commission of the peace until his death. On 31 March 1523 he became the first person who was not an alderman to be returned to parliament for the borough of Colchester. When the speaker, Sir Thomas More, defended the rights of the common people against Cardinal Thomas Wolsey's tax demands, Audley took the latter's side, and thus came to the attention of the minister and of Henry VIII (1491&#150;1547).<br>
<br>From that point a succession of appointments, honours, and offices marked Audley's rise to prominence. In August and November 1523 he was named for Colchester to subsidy commissions and in July 1525 was one of six learned counsel appointed to the king's council in the marches of Wales, nominally headed by Princess Mary. He was made attorney-general during pleasure of the duchy of Lancaster on 11 December 1526, and continued in office until 30 September 1531, when he was granted a life annuity instead. On 24 July 1540 he was also made duchy steward for Essex, Hertfordshire, and Middlesex and appointed constable of Hertford Castle. By March 1527 he was a member of Wolsey's household, and in July he became a groom of the king's chamber. Audley is said to have &#145;hoped for the great seal on Wolsey's fall&#146;, but if such was his ambition, it was thwarted by the appointment of More to the office on 26 October 1529  (Purnell, 32).<br>
<br>In 1529 Audley was returned as knight of the shire for Essex, and on 4 December that year was named speaker, reputedly at the instigation of the king. He proved his worth during the Reformation Parliament, playing a key role in steering through the Commons the legislation that led to the break with Rome and permitted Henry to divorce Katherine of Aragon. Audley was so successful in this that John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, accused the Commons of promoting the church's destruction. Audley led a group of thirty men to protest to the king at being compared to heathens and infidels, and Henry warned Fisher to moderate his comments. Audley's triumphs in oratory were matched by further advancement: he was elevated to serjeant-at-law on 12 or 13 November 1531.<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>Audley was knighted and made keeper of the great seal on 20 May 1532, four days after More resigned as lord chancellor. However, he had to wait until 26 January 1533 before being named lord chancellor himself. E. K. Purnell claimed that Audley's talents as a parliamentary manager delayed his appointment as lord chancellor. Another conjecture is that he was finally named to the office because of the discovery of Anne Boleyn's pregnancy, which meant that a compliant lord chancellor was needed to speed the divorce. These arguments are symbiotic; Anne's secret marriage, due to the discovery of her pregnancy, took place in the period between two sessions of the parliament (December 1532 to January 1533). The impending birth of an heir gave the king greater impetus for a legislative break with Rome and the foundation of a separate Church of England. Consequently, Audley's promotion gave him a greater platform for influence, particularly in the House of Lords, where he is credited with smoothing the path for the king's legislative programme.<br>
<br>Promotion to lord chancellor did not immediately increase Audley's intimacy with Henry. His role appears to have been as a conduit between the council and the courts, when he was not away on local business. Already by October 1532 he was managing royal business in the absence of Thomas Cromwell and the king, who were both at Calais at the time. During the 1530s Audley's letters containing legal advice for the king and requests for grants for himself were addressed to Cromwell, who would then pass them to Henry. Such requests were generally couched in the most humble and submissive of terms, yet his letters regarding legal affairs suggest that Audley was confident, even aggressive, in promoting his professional opinion, and also that he was thorough and well prepared, providing ample examples from legal precedent to back up his arguments but also suggesting alternative stratagems. Upon Cromwell's fall in 1540 and the division of his responsibilities among the privy council Audley was given primary authority over &#145;affairs of justice&#146;. This elevation was disparaged by the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, bishop of Vienne, who said Audley &#145;can neither speak French nor Latin, and has the reputation of being a good seller of justice whenever he can find a buyer&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 15, no. 804). Marillac's judgement hardly seems fair or credible. Audley was a good servant and an astute politician, but decisions rarely appear motivated by profit rather than justice. In 1532 he disagreed with Cromwell and Sir William Paulet over their method of handling one of Henry's suits, saying that he felt they could take a more just approach and still maintain &#145;the king's honour and profit&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 9, no. 1721). Justice and its accomplishment formed a common theme of his correspondence; in May 1537 he requested Cromwell to countermand an order to deliver a prisoner to Sir William Brereton. Audley feared that Brereton would attempt to save the man from execution, as he had done before, and protested that it would not serve justice.<br>
<br>Audley's parliamentary orations were masterful. In one speech in 1531 he represented the Commons as grieved over losing the king's favour, rather than aggrieved in the matter of the supplication of the ordinaries; in another, in 1536, he persuaded MPs eager for the dissolution of parliament of Henry's great need of their continued services in order to resolve the succession, portraying their duty as aiding the king for the benefit of the commonwealth. Audley has been accused of obsequiousness: certainly, he would put off decisions to await the king's pleasure; but this could be better characterized as prudence, a quality he had in abundance. He neither hesitated to call attention to his clever means of achieving the best result for Henry, nor failed to disagree with other royal servants over an issue he perceived could be settled by more equitable, or more legalistic, solutions. He also had his own interests in legal reform, independent from Cromwell's. Although the two men formed an effective partnership, crafting bills which Audley then did his best to pass through parliament, in 1540 the lord chancellor was the instigator of a major attempt at law reform&#151;particularly land law&#151;which resulted in an act to prohibit wrongful disseisin by inheritance, and another strengthening the rights of lessees of land. After Cromwell's fall Audley became the prime instigator and manager of parliamentary legislation.<br>
<br>Audley also defended his position against encroachment, and refused to be made a scapegoat for others' mistakes. When told that Henry had been informed that certain acquittances had been lost because of his negligence, Audley protested he had no control over the dispatches once they had left his hands, and would not accept blame. He argued at length with Cromwell over the right to nominate the under-sheriff of London in 1535, and held his ground in the matter, despite accusations against him of ingratitude. He also did not hesitate to speak the blunt truth to supplicants for his help. In September 1537 the London clothmakers complained to him of the disastrous effects to their business if the suspended act regulating the manufacture of cloth was allowed to take force, and threatened to cease doing business if the suspension was not continued. Though Audley did write to Cromwell recommending that the suspension be extended, he told the clothmakers that they were capable of complying with the act if they so willed, and that if business did cease and people were angered by the loss of jobs, it would be on their heads.<br>
<br>Audley's willingness and ability to pursue courses that were satisfactory to the royal will were balanced by his desire to preserve the power of parliament and the exactitude of the law. He has been called a man &#145;anxious for the right and true meaning of the law&#146; to prevail, and Sir Geoffrey Elton identified him as one of the &#145;great chancellor-judges of the sixteenth century &hellip; [who] defined and developed the principles on which the seventeenth century erected a coherent system of law&#146; (Guy, <span class="italic">Cardinal's Court</span>, 107; Elton, <span class="italic">England under the Tudors</span>, 81). These objectives sometimes brought him into conflict with others. When Arthur Plantagenet, sixth Viscount Lisle, protested against the subpoena of two of his men at Calais in 1535 Audley firmly upheld the letter of the law against his apparent request to drop process so that the men would not have to return to England. In 1547 Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, in a letter to Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector to Edward VI, recounted an exchange with Audley during a case of <i>praemunire</i> against John Veysey, bishop of Exeter, and his chancellor. Audley directed Gardiner to cease his persistent arguments in their favour lest he be accused of the same crime, whereupon the bishop &#145;concluded it seemed to me strange that a man authorized by the king (as since the King's Majesty hath taken upon him the supremacy every bishop is such one) could fall in a praemunire&#146;. Gardiner claimed Audley told him privately that without <i>praemunire</i> Henry and his bishops could combine their jurisdictions to &#145;order the laity as ye listed&#146;. Instead, said Audley, &#145;we will provide &hellip; that the praemunire shall ever hang over your heads, and so we laymen shall be sure to enjoy our inheritance by the common laws and acts of Parliament&#146;  (Elton, <span class="italic">Tudor Constitution</span>, 25). At More's trial on 1 July 1535 Audley's riposte to the defendant's declaration that the <span class="roman">Act of Supremacy</span> went against natural law and reason was that the prelates, universities, and lawyers of the realm had all agreed to its validity. Such blunt and matter-of-fact confrontations may have been one reason why Audley complained of being &#145;accepted better as a poor, honest man before he became Chancellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 9, no. 528).<h2>
<a name="Elevationtothepeerage"></a>Elevation to the peerage</h2>Further elevation came in the form of Audley's creation as Baron Audley of Walden on 29 November 1538 and his election on 23 April and installation on 19 May 1540 as a knight of the Garter. The <span class="roman">Act of Precedence</span> passed by the 1539 parliament also elevated Audley's political importance, giving him precedence over all but dukes of royal blood in parliament, privy council, and Star Chamber. Lady Audley died on 23 January 1538. Three months later, on 22 April 1538, Audley married Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1557), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11561/', "Thomas Grey, second marquess of Dorset (1477&#150;1530)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret. Audley's second marriage may have brought as much grief as good. Though it made him cousin by marriage to the king, his father-in-law had been in and out of favour with both Henry VII and Henry VIII during a chequered career, and on 28 June 1541 Dorset's brother Leonard Grey, Viscount Graney (<i>c</i>.1490&#150;1541), was executed for treason. Audley himself insisted, in a letter in which he sued for grants of former monastic land in order to ensure an estate for his heirs, that he had married at the king's command. He used similar pleas about how he expected Henry to support his marriage in a letter of 1539 or 1540, requesting a favourable exchange of lands with the king to compensate himself for the loss of the manors of St Osyth's and St John's in Essex. Such hard-nosed petitioning may help explain Audley's reputation as rapacious and grasping, but his complaints sound less like rapacity than anxiety over the cost of maintaining the substantial establishment necessary for a leading royal servant. He does appear to have been obsessed by fears of penury, and he was quick to spot opportunity and to pursue it. On writing to Cromwell enclosing letters patent for a grant of Essex manors to Anne, he asked him to beg the queen for the keepership of one of the parks.<br>
<br>Audley and his second wife had two daughters, Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1546), who remained unmarried, and Margaret (1540&#150;1564), who married first Henry Dudley (1531?&#150;1557), then Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, and died on 10 January 1564. Audley had kinsmen to provide for, including two brothers, Thomas and Henry Audley. He later left Thomas his manor of Berechurch. Often, Audley's letters requesting grants of benefices or offices included the comment that they would not enrich him but rather provide for a kinsman or servant. One John Green complained to Thomas Wriothesley in January 1538 that Audley had not helped him to gain the offices and benefits he hoped for while in his service, as &#145;my Lord has so many of my Lady his last wife's kindred looking to him for promotion&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/1, no. 866).<br>
<br>Cromwell's execution did not change the focus of Audley's duties. Audley appears to have still been the mainstay of the privy council based in London, where he served as a contact for foreign ambassadors, received orders through the privy councillors at court regarding business to be done, passed information on to them regarding London issues, and responded to their summons to debate specific matters in which his legal expertise was presumably desired. In particular, he appears to have been considered the expert on issues of treason. His London house at Christ Church in Aldgate became a convenient meeting place and informal gaol: Agnes, duchess of Norfolk, was detained there during the investigation of Katherine Howard, and in June 1543 one of Marillac's messengers was to be intercepted, and &#145;brought privily to the lord Chancellor's house and kept in secret custody&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 18/1, no. 727). Though not among the first rank of politicians, Audley moved in exalted circles, particularly where his expertise was called into use. In June 1543 he was one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate peace between England and Scotland and between Mary, queen of Scots, and Edward, prince of Wales, and he was present at such great ceremonies as Edward's baptism and the arrival in England of Anne of Cleves. In September 1538 he was also granted permission by Henry to visit Edward at Havering in Essex. He wrote a chatty description of the occasion, complimenting the child, observing that Edward's attendants were inclined to be a bit overprotective, and expressing his relief that the prince's household would be moving from Havering before the winter cold set in. He enjoyed greater local consequence and was appointed to county commissions along with the other leading nobles, including the wealthiest and most powerful man in Essex, John de Vere, fifteenth earl of Oxford. In 1539 both men were included on the commission for the defence of the coast along the Thames estuary and in Essex. He enjoyed his new status, writing to Cromwell in September 1538 that he was off to visit Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, at Framlingham in Suffolk, &#145;to kill some of his bucks there&#146;  (Cook, 196).<h2>
<a name="Royalservantandreputation"></a>Royal servant and reputation</h2>Audley facilitated the removal of many of the human obstacles to the achievement of Henry's desires, in particular when dealing with queens who had outlived their usefulness as far as the king was concerned. He drafted bills with Cromwell in 1531&#150;2 dealing with the issues of the English archiepiscopal power to grant divorce and denial of papal authority over the prelacy, and secured passage of the act in restraint of appeals, the <span class="roman">Act of Supremacy</span>, and the other statutes that made possible the break with Rome. In his dealings with Anne Boleyn and her successors, Audley was given the thankless task of first arranging successful marriages, and later facilitating divorces or executions, and he tended to both sides of this business in his straightforward, lawyerly fashion. At the beginning of Anne's rise to power Audley was regarded by some as one of her allies and supporters. After her fall in 1536, as lord chancellor he tried her alleged accomplices, and attended her own trial as adviser to the panel of peers on legal matters. He was also present at her execution on 19 May. In the same fashion Audley negotiated the king's marriage to Anne of Cleves. However, on 6 July 1540 he was among those who informed Anne of the parliamentary suit for examination of her marriage by the clergy, and gave deposition the following day to convocation regarding impediments to the union. He was also one of the men who interrogated Katherine Howard and others in November and December 1541 regarding accusations of her infidelity and wantonness, and was ordered to reveal to the privy council in Star Chamber the queen's &#145;abominable demeanour&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 16, nos. 1331, 1334, 1408, 1422). Audley was appointed a commissioner for the trial of her accomplices Thomas Culpeper and Francis Dereham, as well as that of her uncle Lord William Howard, and others accused of misprision in the case. This particular aspect of Audley's career supports the view of him as a pragmatist, concerned above all with peace and order, the authority of crown and parliament, and the ascendancy of the royal interest.<br>
<br>The event that contributed most to Audley's negative historical reputation was one of the first major state trials of his career. In 1535 Audley issued the commissions for and directed the trials of Fisher and More for treason in their refusal to take the oath of succession. In particular, Audley is condemned over his handling of More's trial. He is accused of permitting the weight of the conviction to rest on the unsubstantiated testimony of Richard Rich, for overruling More's objections to this in his defence, and for beginning to pass sentence on him without allowing the former lord chancellor the opportunity to argue against conviction. Audley was also the person entrusted with attainting Cromwell, his former friend and ally, through a parliamentary act of 19 June 1540, a device that offered the defendant no chance to defend himself. Audley also served as lord high steward for the trials of Henry Pole, Baron Montagu, and Henry Courtenay, marquess of Exeter, on 2 December 1538, and Thomas Fiennes, ninth Baron Dacre of the South, on 27 June 1541. In any legal issue, Henry could rely on his lord chancellor to provide the best solution for him, taking into account both his wishes and the course of justice, and doing his best to reconcile the two.<br>
<br>In matters of religion, Audley was assiduous in orchestrating the break with Rome, but it is difficult to support the view of him as protestant. When discussing in a letter to Cromwell a book on iconoclasm he had seen, he expressed anxiety over it and said he intended to stop its publication, fearing its effects on law and order. He said it would be well for people to hold off their opinions of such &#145;until the King has put a final order&#146; in the light of the report of his commissioners  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 9, no. 358). Audley's precise views on theology and doctrine in relation to his private worship are obscure, but royal and parliamentary decisions were his guide to action. He has been claimed as radical and evangelical, but his status as champion of the protestant faith may be due to his office, which brought him into the central arena of the legislative programme that changed the religion of the kingdom.<br>
<br>Audley's close partnership with Cromwell, with both men being regarded as reformist, may also have had its effect on estimations of the lord chancellor's religious affinities. Franz Burchard, the Saxon vice-chancellor, explained in a letter to Philip Melanchthon that the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> had been promoted by men who desired Cromwell's downfall, Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, and Audley, whom he still called &#145;excellent men, and most friendly to the purer doctrine of the gospel&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 14/2, no. 423). Testimony regarding the Lincolnshire rising of 1536 indicated that rhymes which &#145;had been sung abroad by minstrels&#146; about the men blamed for schism and dissolution included Audley's name, and a servant of Thomas Marshall, abbot of Colchester, testified in November 1539 that his master had said &#145;I would to Christ that the rebels in the North country had the bishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, and the lord Privy Seal [Cromwell] amongst them and then I trust we should have a merry world again&#146; (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 1021, 3&#150;4; <span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 14/2, no. 439). Still, Audley's temper in religious matters appears moderate; he was not regarded as a sacramentarian like Cromwell in 1540, and was appointed, with the conservatives Norfolk and William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton, to interrogate Cromwell regarding Anne of Cleves's betrothal. In 1539 he also received from Gardiner the right of a presentation to a living, and considering the bishop's conservatism, it seems doubtful that he would have given such opportunity to an evangelical, even if he were wooing him for political reasons. David Lloyd commented in his seventeenth-century biographical sketch of the lord chancellor, &#145;Cromwell pulled down Popery with his power: Audley kept it down with his policy&#146;  (Lloyd, 75).<br>
<br>The dissolution of the monasteries was of great personal benefit to Audley. Thomas Fuller, in his <span class="italic">Church History</span>, said that Audley received the grant of Christ Church in London, the first priory to be suppressed, &#145;to clear his voice, to make him speak shrill and loud for his master&#146;  (Fuller, 358&#150;9). Richard Griffin, third Baron Braybrooke, called Audley the &#145;principal actor of the dissolution&#146;, and credited him with drawing up, with Rich's help, the <span class="roman">Act of Dissolution</span> of 1536, which also created the court of augmentations  (Braybrooke, 10). However, Marillac credited Rich and Cromwell with the invention and authorization of the dissolution. In September 1540 Audley did gain the lucrative augmentations office of high steward of all lands formerly belonging to religious houses north of the Trent.<br>
<br>From the dissolved houses Audley, a man of modest origins, built up a substantial estate. On 26 May 1536 he was granted St Botolph's in Colchester, and two days later he received the priory of Prittlewell, also in Essex. In April 1542 he was given the priory of Colchester and the abbey of Tilty in Essex. Fears of dissolution also helped expand his holdings: the manor at Berechurch was allegedly given to him in 1531 by Sir William Weston, prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England, for help in preventing the dissolution of the order. Such may also have been the case with the exchanges made by Weston in 1538 of the manors of Rye in Essex and Gosbeck in Suffolk to Audley in return for a rectory and advowson in Warwickshire. It certainly was the case in an exchange by John, abbot of St Osyth, in 1538 of the manors of Abberton and Abbots, as well as other properties in Essex and Suffolk, for lands belonging to Audley. Additionally, Audley purchased manors and lands from the nunnery of Holywell, Hertfordshire, in 1537, and received a grant of lands in Hertfordshire in December 1538, to be held from the king, from the abbey of St Mary by the Tower. The most valued of his acquisitions was Walden Abbey, the source of his title, which was granted to him in March 1538, and renamed Audley End in 1616 by his grandson Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk, in honour of his eminent forebear.<br>
<br>Arguments regarding Audley's sympathy towards the floundering abbeys have been advanced, relative to his plea to the king not to dissolve St John's and St Osyth's but rather turn them into collegiate churches. Audley's actions suggest that rather than having sympathy for all victims of the dissolution, he was concerned with protecting, as best he could, interests in his local domain of Colchester, or at least softening the blow he knew would come. In September 1535 he wrote asking Cromwell to excuse Barking Abbey in Essex from examination by Sir Thomas Legh until Audley could speak privately to Cromwell regarding the matter. In July 1539 an inventory of the goods of St Osyth indicated that several articles of plate were delivered to the abbot &#145;by my Lord Chancellor's command&#146;, and a letter from Audley of 4 August 1539 requested speedy execution of the patents for pensions for the late abbot and convent  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 14/1, no. 1326). He also is said to have advised St Mary's, his parish in Colchester, to sell off its church goods in advance of possible dissolution in order to benefit the parish. None the less, Marshall was implacably resentful towards Audley; examinations of Colchester men in 1539 indicated that the abbot wished vengeance on the lord chancellor and others for the destruction of the abbeys, calling them &#145;arch-heretics&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 14/2, nos. 439, 454, 458). It has also been asserted that Audley was offered handsome bribes by the abbot of St Osyth and by Weston if he would plead with the king to spare their religious houses, and certainly he held out the inducement to Henry of &pound;2000 promised by those abbeys in exchange for their survival. Though he held St Osyth's and St John's at pleasure by 1539, and asked for the grant of St Osyth for life upon its dissolution, Audley did not ultimately gain the properties.<br>
<br>Audley appears to have enjoyed the visible trappings of success. Among the notations in Cromwell's accounts of 1537&#150;9 are some to Audley's company of players or minstrels, and his bargemen. Audley had amassed a substantial landed estate by his death (valuing it as worth about &pound;800 per annum in 1539/40), but he complained incessantly that he was also at the mercy of the expense of office. In suing to the king for St Osyth, he wrote to Cromwell that the lord chancellorship, though &#145;high and honourable&#146;, was also &#145;cumbrous and chargeable&#146;, and that he had no other offices or fees to enhance his income  (Cook, 183). An example of his fiscal burdens may be seen in the observation made by the imperial ambassador, Eustache Chapuys, in 1542 that Audley was one of those wealthy enough for Henry to request from him a loan. The figure in question was &pound;4000; only Norfolk and Charles Brandon, first duke of Suffolk, paid more. Audley himself stated in a letter of 1538 that he had advanced more than &pound;1000 from his own fees of office in pensions to former inmates of religious houses and spent more than 1100 marks on the &#145;charges of the rebellion&#146;, for which he knew he could not expect repayment  (ibid., 204). Audley's early obscurity and consequent obsession with acquiring wealth and status, the great expense that his elevated position then entailed, and his hopes of further consideration by Henry in terms of lands or gifts are constant themes of his correspondence.<br>
<br>Historical judgement of Audley is mixed. Fuller said of the black marble tomb at Saffron Walden containing his remains, &#145;the stone is not harder, nor the marble blacker, than the heart of him who lies beneath&#146;  (Purnell, 37). With regard to his personal attributes, Lloyd described Audley as &#145;one whose Austerity was allayed with debonairness, whose Gravity was sweetened with pleasantness; whose knowledge was as large as his authority, whose wit was equal with his wisdom&#146;, and added that Audley's soul was &#145;quick, solid, apprehensive and judicious&#146;, his body &#145;tall and majestic&#146;  (Lloyd, 72). The most positive judgement of Audley is one that also rings true: he weathered the political storms by knowing how to bend to them, and by being temperate, calm, and judicious. &#145;Patience can weather out the most turbulent age, and a solid judgment the most intricate times; the reserved and quiet man is the most secure&#146;  (ibid., 75). Audley retained Henry's favour throughout his life, a rare accomplishment for royal servants of the second Tudor king. On 21 April 1544 Audley gave up the great seal, professing himself uncertain of his ability to perform his duties &#145;through infirmity of body&#146;, an unsurprising decision, considering he had been absent from most of the parliamentary meetings of 1543 and 1544 owing to illness  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 19/1, no. 459). He died peacefully, aged fifty-six, at his home at Christ Church, Aldgate, London, on 30 April 1544, and was buried at Saffron Walden, Essex.<br>
