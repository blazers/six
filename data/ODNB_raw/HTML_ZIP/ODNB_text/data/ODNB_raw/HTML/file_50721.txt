<span class="headword">Estlin,  Mary Anne</span>  (1820&#150;1902), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born in Bristol, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8896/', "Dr John Bishop Estlin (1785&#150;1855)")</script>, a pioneer ophthalmologist, and his wife (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1822), daughter of the Bagehots of Langport. Her father was the son of a Unitarian minister and she adhered to Unitarianism throughout her life. Mrs Estlin died when Mary was about three years old, and her father did not remarry. In 1832&#150;3 her father spent six months in St Vincent in the West Indies and Mary Estlin accompanied him, seeing at first hand the colonial slave system to which her father was morally opposed. She herself never married, living with her father until his death when she was in her mid-thirties, and thereafter continuing to live in the family home in Park Street, Bristol.<br>
<br>Mary Estlin became a leading British supporter of the radical wing of the American abolitionist movement, which, under the leadership of William Lloyd Garrison, had taken control of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1839. Both Mary and her father conducted an extensive correspondence with the American abolitionists from 1844 onwards, as well as fostering support for Garrison in the west of England and acting as hosts for visiting American anti-slavery lecturers and fund-raisers. In addition Mary co-ordinated British contributions to the Boston Anti-Slavery Bazaar. In 1851 she was appointed a member of the committee of the Bristol and Clifton Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society. She was largely responsible for persuading the committee to take the unprecedented step of publicly severing links with the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society on policy grounds&#151;in particular, the national society's failure to support the American Anti-Slavery Society. The launch of the Bristol society as an independent organization marked the beginning of a period of intense national propaganda by the group under Mary Estlin's direction. She became very influential in transatlantic anti-slavery circles: her advice was increasingly sought by the male leaders of the movement and she acted as a mediator between the rival anti-slavery factions. She maintained her links with American campaigners following abolition, visiting the Garrison family in Boston in 1867&#150;8.<br>
<br>Mary Estlin was also a leading feminist campaigner. She was a member of the executive committee of the Ladies' National Association (1870&#150;86), which co-ordinated the feminist campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>. Josephine Butler, the leader of this campaign, described Mary Estlin and her three Bristol co-workers (the Priestman sisters and Margaret Tanner) as &#145;a kind of body-guard, a <i>corps d'&eacute;lite</i> on whose prompt aid, singleness of purpose, prudence and unwearying industry, I could and can rely at all times&#146;  (Butler, 188&#150;9). Mary was also one of the founding members of the Bristol Women's Suffrage Society (established in 1867), acting as treasurer in its early years. In addition she aided her fellow Unitarian Mary Carpenter's work in the education of destitute girls in Bristol and assisted in the establishment of a hospital for women.<br>
<br>Mary Estlin was described in her obituary by her feminist colleagues as a &#145;warmly sympathetic and lovable&#146; woman who was &#145;a staunch Liberal, with advanced views, strongly advocating the rights of her own sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>, 61&#150;3). She was one of a number of prominent female anti-slavery campaigners who became leading feminist activists during the 1860s and 1870s. Mary Estlin died on 14 November 1902 at her home at 36 Upper Belgrave Road, Clifton, near Bristol.<br>
