<span class="headword">Cary,  Tristram Ogilvie</span>  (1925&#150;2008), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at 12 Parks Road, Oxford, on 14 May 1925, the third of the four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32318/', "(Arthur) Joyce Lunel Cary (1888&#150;1957)")</script>, author, and his wife, Gertrude Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ogilvie (1891&#150;1949). His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30906/', "Sir (Arthur Lucius) Michael Cary (1917&#150;1976)")</script>, civil servant. The family home was at 12 Parks Road, Oxford. His early interest in music was encouraged by his mother and he was already composing and playing the piano as a pupil at the Dragon School in Oxford. He attended Westminster School, London, where he was a king's scholar. His developing interest in technology and engineering saw him go up to Christ Church, Oxford, as an exhibitioner to study science. His studies were interrupted in 1943 when aged seventeen he volunteered, joining the Royal Navy where after further technical training he became involved in the development and testing of specialized ship-borne radar. It was at this point that his two passions, music and technology, started to come together. He saw the potential of the tape recorder, being developed in Germany, as a tool for manipulating natural sounds, and also the possibility of using pure electronic tone as a musical source.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1946, Cary returned to Oxford and then enrolled at Trinity College of Music in London, where he studied composition. Always practical and imaginative, he constructed his first rudimentary electronic music studio using redundant military equipment, a 78 rpm disc cutter, and a very basic tape recorder. All this came with him when, on 7 July 1951, he married Doris Enid (Dorse) Jukes (<i>b</i>. 1922), artist, and daughter of Joseph William Jukes, and moved to a house in Nevern Road, Earls Court. They had three children, John (<i>b</i>. 1952), Robert (<i>b</i>. 1955), and Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1960).<br>
<br>Cary's early compositions were not solely in the rarefied world of electronics. He wrote a series of chamber works; <span class="italic">Partita</span> for piano was given its premiere at the Wigmore Hall in 1949. As with many new graduates he supplemented his income by taking teaching jobs. It was at this time that he was approached by the film director Alexander Mackendrick who asked him to write the incidental music for <span class="italic">The Ladykillers</span> (1955). This was a turning point in his career as it led to more film commissions and to work in the theatre, television, and radio. The financial rewards that came with his success enabled him to buy a cottage in Fressingfield, Suffolk, where he moved in 1963 and where he constructed a new studio. As a professional composer with a family to support he now had to find a balance between working on commissions for the media and writing music for concert performance. He was not alone among composers in finding this balance sometimes difficult to achieve.<br>
<br>Cary continued to create electronic music, gradually improving the equipment in his studio. <span class="italic">Solfeggio</span> for tape (1959) was the first of many concert pieces to be performed in this medium. He began to have opportunities to introduce electronic music into many of his scores for the media, notably in <span class="italic">Dr Who</span> (1963) for BBC Television, and the film <span class="italic">Quatermass and the Pit</span> (1967). This helped to bring electronic music to the notice of a wider public but the natural conservatism of the average listener often led to controversy. Over the next few years he created several concert pieces scored for conventional instruments playing alongside tapes such as <span class="italic">Narcissus</span> (1968), for flute and two tape recorders.<br>
<br>In 1967 Cary founded the electronic music studio at the Royal College of Music. His search for new ways to create electronic music led, in 1969, to a collaboration with the composer Peter Zinovieff and the inventor David Cockerell. Together they created the EMS line of synthesizers, the VCS3 being the best known (used, for instance, by Pink Floyd on their album of 1973, <span class="italic">The Dark Side of the Moon</span>). It was his affinity with the EMS Synthi 100 that led to his first visit to Australia when, in 1973, Melbourne University invited him to spend a term working as visiting composer in their newly opened electronic music studio. He then joined the music department of Adelaide University, where he was to stay for twelve years. This move to academic life in Australia was a significant milestone in his life. He was able to free himself from the financial and professional pressures that until then had dogged him despite his successes. In 1986 he became a full-time composer once again; he took Australian citizenship and in 1991 received the medal of the Order of Australia for his services to Australian music. His first marriage had been dissolved in 1978 and in the early 1980s he began a relationship with Jane Delin; they married in 2003. He died in Adelaide on 24 April 2008 of cancer. A memorial plaque at the Royal College of Music describes him as &#145;The Father of British Electronic Music&#146;.<br>
