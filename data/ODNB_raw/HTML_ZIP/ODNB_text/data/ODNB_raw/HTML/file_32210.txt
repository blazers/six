<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butler,  Frank  Hedges</span>  (1855&#150;1928), <span class="occ">motorist and aviator</span>, was born in London on 17 December 1855, the fifth son of James Butler, wine merchant, of Hollywood, Wimbledon Park, and his wife, Frances Mary, eldest daughter of William Hedges. He was educated at private schools at Brighton and Upper Clapton to 1870 and, after travelling in Europe, Africa, and South America, entered the family business of Hedges and Butler (founded in 1667), Regent Street, London, in which he became a partner in 1882. He married in 1880 Ada (<i>d</i>. 1905), daughter of Joseph Bartholomew Tickle, wool broker, of London and Sydney, and with her had two daughters, Vera (later Vera Nicholl), who shared many of his motoring and ballooning adventures, and Frances, who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Hedges Butler was one of the first people in Britain to own a motor car. He acquired a Benz car in 1897, joined the Automobile Club de France, and then was appointed first honorary treasurer of the newly formed Automobile Club of Great Britain, a post which he held until 1902. With the Hon. Charles Stewart Rolls, he helped to organize races from 1898. It was the shortcomings of a motor car, and the consequent abandonment of a motor tour in Scotland in September 1901, which led Hedges Butler to turn his attention to the air. A balloon ascent was suggested instead of the tour, and Butler, his daughter, and Rolls went up in a balloon, the <i>City of York</i>, from the Crystal Palace, with Stanley Spencer in control. While in the air over London, he suggested the formation of an aero club as a branch of the Automobile Club. The Aero Club of the United Kingdom was registered at Somerset House in October 1901, and the first balloon ascent organized by the club took place on 15 November.<br>
<br>The club (which in 1910 became the Royal Aero Club) brought together inventors and recreational balloonists, and supplied them with a ground at Shell Beach, Isle of Sheppey, suitable for their experiments. Hedges Butler also took a keen interest in the beginnings of powered flight, and in 1908, when the American inventor Wilbur Wright arrived in France to demonstrate his aeroplane, Butler was one of the first two Englishmen to fly as passenger with him.<br>
<br>By 1907 Hedges Butler had completed one hundred balloon ascents, including a solo flight which established a record for distance in Britain (1902), and what was then the world's longest cross-channel balloon voyage (London to Caen, 1905).<br>
<br>As a result of the successful flights by Wilbur Wright in France in 1908, the Aero Club undertook the training of aeroplane pilots, to whom, from 1910 onwards, it issued its certificates; these were recognized by the government when it was decided to establish the Royal Flying Corps. The Aero Club, inspired by Hedges Butler, in fact played an all-important part in fostering the early development of flying in England. Hedges Butler's concern with the air diminished in no way his interest in travel. In the course of his business he often visited the wine-producing regions of Europe&#151;including Champagne in 1914&#150;18, even when fighting was only a few miles away&#151;but these journeys only stimulated his enthusiasm, and with great enjoyment he moved widely about the world. He had been elected FRGS in 1877.<br>
<br>Hedges Butler had still other interests. He was a violinist of merit, and in 1894 founded the Imperial Institute Orchestral Society, in which he played one of the first violins. He was a man of hospitable nature with a gift for friendship, who enjoyed splendid health, as well as ample means to indulge his many enthusiasms. He died in a nursing home at 29 Wimpole Street, London, on 27 November 1928 and was buried in Norwood cemetery three days later.<br>
