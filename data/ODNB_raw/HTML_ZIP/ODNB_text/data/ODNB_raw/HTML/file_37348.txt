<span class="headword">Dawson,  (Henry) Christopher</span>  (1889&#150;1970), <span class="occ">cultural historian</span>, was born on 12 October 1889 at Hay, Brecknockshire, the only son and younger child of Colonel Henry Philip Dawson (1850&#150;1933), a Yorkshire landowner, and his wife, Mary Louisa, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31870/', "Archdeacon William Latham Bevan")</script> of Hay Castle. He was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in modern history in 1911. His health prevented active service in the First World War but from 1916 he worked in the war trade intelligence department and in Admiralty research. In that year he married Valery Mary, youngest daughter of Walter Edward Mills, architect, of Oxford. She was the ideal partner for such an unworldly and impractical scholar and thinker, taking all the burdens of daily living off his shoulders. They had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Dawson had sufficient private means to be able to follow his own highly original path of historical research and reflection, so that his first book, <span class="italic">The Age of the Gods</span> (1928), was the result of fourteen years of research. But it was his second, <span class="italic">Progress and Religion</span> (1929), that first displayed fully the depth of his thought and the astonishing range of his learning. In this, he articulated the theme of all his subsequent writings, that religion is the dynamic of all social culture. <span class="italic">The Making of Europe</span> (1932) discussed a specific case of this, showing that the &#145;dark ages&#146; were in fact the most creative period in the culture of the Western world. He developed both these topics further in his Gifford lectures for Edinburgh University, <span class="italic">Religion and Culture</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">Religion and the Rise of Western Culture</span> (1950).<br>
<br>Dawson, who had become a Roman Catholic shortly after going down from Oxford, was an influential member of the group of writers which formed around the new Catholic publishing house of Sheed and Ward from the 1930s. For them he edited and contributed to a series of books entitled <span class="italic">Essays in Order</span>. In 1933 he produced <span class="italic">Enquiries into Religion and Culture</span>, in 1934 <span class="italic">Medieval Religion</span>, and in 1943 a very personal socio-political testament, <span class="italic">The Judgment of the Nations</span>. The admiration which churchmen such as Cardinal Arthur Hinsley and Bishop G. K. A. Bell of Chichester had for Dawson involved him actively as vice-president in the Sword of the Spirit, a proto-ecumenical movement which, to his disappointment, proved to be too visionary for the Roman authorities of the time.<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Dawson's output of books and articles increasingly stressed the twin themes of Europe and education. He campaigned for an integrated study of Christian philosophy, history, literature, and art in the same way as <i>literae humaniores</i> had studied every aspect of classical culture. Only this, he believed, could overcome the schism between religion and culture in the West.<br>
<br>Dawson's achievement owed virtually nothing to the academic world, apart from a short part-time lectureship in the history of culture at the University College in Exeter (1925&#150;33). When he was eventually offered a chair, at the age of sixty-eight, it was not in Britain but in the USA at Harvard. He was professor of Roman Catholic studies there from 1958 to 1962. He was sensitive to this lack of recognition, but at the same time fully understood how much he owed to having been saved from the academic treadmill. In any event, he was physically frail and temperamentally extremely shy and gentle, so that he was unable to do his thought and learning full justice before even small audiences. In contrast, in a one-to-one relationship he was an incomparable teacher. He was elected fellow of the British Academy in 1943.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1933 Dawson inherited the family property in Yorkshire and went to live at Hartlington Hall, but stayed there only a few years because of his frail health. The family then moved to Boars Hill, near Oxford. When his failing health caused his Harvard stay to be cut short, Dawson retired to Fountain Hill House, Budleigh Salterton, Devon; he died in Budleigh Salterton on 25 May 1970 and was buried in St Wilfrid's Church, Burnsall, near Skipton in Yorkshire.<br>
