<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Thomas</span>, seventh earl of Desmond  (1426?&#150;1468), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son and heir of James Fitzgerald, sixth earl (<i>d</i>. 1462/3), and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Ulick Burke, lord of Clanricarde. He was probably born in 1426 but little is known of him before his father's death in 1462 or 1463. Unlike the sixth earl, who had shown little inclination for affairs of state, Earl Thomas was an active and ambitious politician. In Edward IV's appointment of him on 2 August 1462 as steward of Connacht and constable of Limerick Castle, he was already styled earl of Desmond and his previous service to Richard, duke of York, is also mentioned. The appointment coincided with a Lancastrian invasion of Ireland led by Sir John Butler, heir to the attainted earl of Ormond, who took prisoner Desmond's brother, Garret Fitzgerald, and then captured Waterford. In pitched battle at Piltown, near Carrick-on-Suir, Desmond defeated the Butlers of Polestown, who had joined the Lancastrians, after which the Lancastrian rising gradually subsided. Edward IV rewarded him for this victory by appointment in April 1463 as deputy to George, duke of Clarence, the nominal lieutenant of Ireland, despite the risk that the earl was too compromised by close relations with Gaelic chiefs in Munster to command universal support among the Englishry. Thus, by conferring the governorship on the most remote of the three Irish-based earls, Edward inaugurated an unusual experiment in the crown's efforts to extend the Dublin administration's normal range of operation.<br>
<br>Desmond's comparatively meagre landed inheritance in Kerry, Cork, and Limerick offered little help in the primary task of ruling the strategic heartland of English Ireland, around Dublin; but this problem was solved by associating with the earl in government two previous governors with extensive lands there&#151;Roland FitzEustace, Lord Portlester (<i>d</i>. 1496), who remained as treasurer; and Desmond's kinsman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9585/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, seventh earl of Kildare (d. 1478)")</script>, who soon took over the chancellorship. Edward ordered Desmond to govern with Portlester's advice and, more pointedly, to have &#145;a special respect to the observance of oure lawes and statutes there&#146;, and in particular not to impose on the king's subjects &#145;that dampnable and unlawful extortion and oppression used upon thaime called coyne and liverie&#146;  (Cosgrove, &#145;Execution&#146;, 16). In fact, Desmond's deputyship was overshadowed by complaints about his attempts to maintain his retinue by introducing into the English pale coign and livery (the free quartering of troops in the manner of a Gaelic chief) and other Gaelic exactions; these eventually proved his undoing. Within months, a Drogheda merchant laid charges before the king of coign and livery imposed on Meath. In 1464 a feud between the earl and William Sherwood, bishop of Meath, who spearheaded the Meath gentry's opposition to his rule, led to the killing of nine of Desmond's followers in Fingal. And after Desmond had ignored the king's appointment as chancellor of John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester, with Sherwood as his deputy, and appointed Kildare instead, both Sherwood and Desmond were summoned to court. Desmond left with a glowing testimonial from the Irish parliament, which stressed his service in upholding law and order and repressing Lancastrian risings by the Butlers and in Meath. Indeed, parliament's proceedings underlined not only the continuing wide support for Earl Thomas but also the unwontedly vigorous activity in outlying parts of the English lordship which characterized his deputyship. The king confirmed him in office and also rewarded him with an annuity of &pound;100, financed by a life grant of six manors in Meath, so strengthening his hand there.<br>
<br>Despite this and a parliamentary act of resumption, however, Desmond remained hard pressed to maintain an adequate retinue without financial assistance from England; and by mid-1465, when Worcester was appointed to replace him as deputy and then countermanded, Earl Thomas's influence was waning. While campaigning in Offaly in 1466, he was taken prisoner by the &Oacute; Conchobhair Failghe chief, Conn, though he was later rescued by the English of Dublin. Continuing Gaelic raids on Meath and north Kildare, however, called in question his ability to defend the pale; and in Munster the &Oacute; Briain family exploited Desmond's troubles to strengthen their power east of the Shannon. Thus, in spring 1467, Edward decided to replace him and the earl of Worcester arrived in October with the considerable retinue of 700 English archers to restore order. Despite Worcester's fearsome reputation as &#145;the butcher&#146; his relations with the Geraldines remained ostensibly civil. Yet when Worcester's parliament reconvened at Drogheda on 4 February 1468, a bill of attainder was introduced and Desmond, together with the earl of Kildare and Edward Plunket, found himself attainted without warning of &#145;horrible treasons and felonies &hellip; as well in alliance, fosterage and alterage, with the Irish enemies of the king, as in giving them horses and harness and arms, and supporting them against the king's faithful subjects&#146;  (Berry, 465). Portlester was also accused of treason for having urged Desmond to make himself king of Ireland. The earl, who had attended parliament against the advice of his friends, was within eight days arrested at the Dominican convent in Drogheda. From Friday 12 February until the following Monday, he remained in custody &#145;in daily expectancy of death&#146;  (Cosgrove, &#145;Execution&#146;, 23) and was then taken out and beheaded. He was buried in St Peter's Church, Drogheda, but a century later Sir Henry Sidney removed his tomb to Holy Trinity Cathedral, Dublin. Gaelic annalists praised his hospitality, bounty, and patronage of the learned classes (he founded the college at Youghal). His widow, Ellice, daughter of Lord Barry of Buttevant, later married Maurice Fitzgibbon, the white knight.<br>
<br>Desmond's execution both shocked and puzzled contemporaries. The annals of Ulster related that Ireland had never had &#145;a foreign youth that was better than he. And he was killed in treachery by an English earl&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Ulster</span>, 3.220&#150;21). An English chronicler reported that Desmond's execution displeased the king; and Richard III later admitted that he had been slain against &#145;all manhode, reason and good conscience&#146;  (Gairdner, 69&#150;70). A later tradition had it that the queen, Elizabeth Woodville, in revenge for the earl's criticism of her marriage, had surreptitiously secured his death warrant by procuring the king's signet while he was still in bed. Yet the most likely reason for Desmond's execution is the charge of imposing coign and livery. This indeed was Sir William Darcy's view: in a report to the English council in 1515 he observed that Desmond was the first to impose coign and livery on the English pale. Serious disturbances followed his execution, during which Kildare and Portlester fled to Desmond's brother. Kildare's attainder had to be reversed and Desmond's son, James (<i>d</i>. 1487), received livery of his inheritance even though under age. Yet the family remained estranged from the crown; the earl's brother disputed the succession; and English influence in the south-west was greatly reduced.<br>
