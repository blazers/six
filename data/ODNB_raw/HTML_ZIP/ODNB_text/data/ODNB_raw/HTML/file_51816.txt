<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cumming,  (Felicity) Anne</span>  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">writer and sexual adventurer</span>, was born on 14 December 1917, at Thames Cottage, Thames Street, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, the daughter of Howard Cumming (1885&#150;1957), captain in the Royal Flying Corps, timber merchant, and later a company director, and his wife, (Eileen) Norah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Groves 
    (later Rabeneck; 1895&#150;1938)
  . She had at least two brothers. Her grandfather was Sir Grimble Groves, brewery owner and Conservative MP for South Salford. She claimed descent from the medieval Scottish magnate Red Comyn. She spent her childhood on her father's farm in South Africa before boarding at Horsely Towers School in Kent after her parents' divorce. She came out as a d&eacute;butante in 1935, during which year she lost her virginity on a park bench under the Eiffel Tower. She studied dance with a friend of Isadora Duncan in Paris and then drama at Dartington Hall with Mikhail Chekhov, the nephew of the playwright (who died in the arms of her Russian stepfather Lieve Rabeneck). Cumming also studied foreign languages in France and Germany. On 10 September 1938 she married Henry Landall Lyon Young (<i>b</i>. 1909), who had been brought up in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, and was an aspirant playwright. He was supposedly a distant cousin of Elizabeth, later the queen mother, and author of <span class="italic">Baroque Tales of Chile</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">Regent of Paraguay</span> (1966). They had two daughters. Cumming, Young, and Chekhov travelled to the United States, where they hoped to set up a theatrical company, but Chekhov's death and the outbreak of the Second World War frustrated these plans. Cumming and Young continued to live in New York, where she modelled for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> and <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>. After wartime employment with British intelligence Cumming returned in 1944 to London.<br>
<br>In 1948 Cumming eloped across Europe in an army surplus jeep with Richard Mason (<i>b</i>. 1919), whom she married later that year after divorcing Young. Mason, who had recently published his first novel, <span class="italic">The Wind cannot Read</span> (1947), became celebrated as the author of <span class="italic">The World of Suzie Wong</span> (1957). While working as a translator, interpreter, and courier for the British Council, Cumming befriended the writer Francis King in Greece. He found her &#145;an exhilarating companion, totally uninhibited in her talk and her behaviour&#146;, who joined him picking up &#145;eager sailors, soldiers and airmen&#146;  (King, 137). The atmosphere of expatriate male homosexuality was congenial to her. In 1952, while her husband was visiting the South Seas, she set off by herself for Marrakesh where she met the Swiss-Canadian painter, writer, and restaurateur Brion Gysin, who became her lifelong friend. She also knew William Burroughs and Paul and Jane Bowles. An intrepid and gleeful traveller, she had numerous sexual encounters with young Arab men while on a bus tour of the Sahara. She returned to her husband in Chelsea, but when in 1953 he left on a long Oriental business journey she decamped to Iran, where she had further amorous adventures.<br>
<br>In 1955 Cumming separated amicably from Mason (they were later divorced); he and her first husband liked one another and were close friends. She settled in Rome, teaching English in the British Institute, and began a relationship with Beni Montresor (1926&#150;2001), eight years her junior, who became a successful set and costume designer for films and opera. (In her memoirs he is referred to as Rudi or the Baron.) Montresor was the author of several books, including <span class="italic">Cinderella: from the Opera</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">Bedtime!</span> (1978). When Montresor abandoned Cumming in 1960 he gave her a gold ring inscribed &#145;Always and Never&#146;; they remained devoted. In 1960 she left the British Institute to earn her living in Rome as a dialogue coach and publicist for film companies. Thereafter she used men as divertissements rather than as <i>raisons d'&ecirc;tre</i>. She was a woman of tireless physical curiosity, for whom sexual acts were both agreeably stupefying and emotionally absorbing: &#145;Copulation is communication; and I want to be wanted&#146;  (Cumming, <span class="italic">Love Habit</span>, 18).<br>
<br>After Montresor, Cumming had an intermittent twenty-year relationship with an Italian long-distance lorry driver, who provided problem-free sex, and with other men and boys of all classes, some of whom were primarily interested in other men. She also resumed her sexual &#145;tourism&#146;, and was gang-raped in Cairo in 1963. In 1965 she lived in Paris for a few months to write a novel, &#145;Beyond this Limit&#146;, about &#145;a homosexual who cannot love the men he sleeps with but who desperately loves a woman&#146;  (Cumming, <span class="italic">Love Quest</span>, 154). It was never finished. From 1968 she regularly visited New York where she ran a series of Chekhov theatrical workshops. She was also an occasional actress, appearing in <span class="italic">The Girl who Couldn't Say No</span> as George Segal's mother in 1969. A publishing friend persuaded her to write a zestfully licentious account of her love life covering the decade after her fiftieth birthday. This was published as <span class="italic">The Love Habit</span> (1977). A sequel, <span class="italic">The Love Quest</span> (1991), describes her sexual tourism from 1952 until the early 1960s. The two books are often cheerfully raffish, but sometimes descend into gruesome particularity about men's bodies and desires. There are droll passages, but also wearying phases in both books. To publicize <span class="italic">The Love Quest</span> Cumming was photographed topless in the <span class="italic">Sunday Sport</span>, which in turn elicited an invitation to appear as a dancer in Las Vegas. In the year of her death she appeared on television wearing only a pearl necklace, earrings, and hat in the world's first nude chat show. She revelled in colour, vulgarity, and vitality.<br>
<br>In 1986 Cumming learned that she was HIV-positive and settled in London so as to benefit from the National Health Service. She preferred to keep her status confidential and she continued with her travels until her death. At her flat in Lisson Street she held a regular salon in which she sought to introduce young writers, actors, and designers to useful contacts. As a member of the <i>nouveaux pauvres</i> she offered Marks and Spencer food on chipped porcelain bought in nearby Church Street market. Drunkenness bored her, so she served only tea poured from an enormous stained pot. She died of bronchopneumonia on 28 August 1993 at the London Lighthouse, a care centre for people with HIV and AIDS at 111&#150;17 Lancaster Road, Kensington, London.<br>
