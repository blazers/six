</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Polwhele,  Richard</span>  (1760&#150;1838), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Truro, Cornwall, on 6 January 1760, the only son of Thomas Polwhele (<i>d</i>. 1777) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1804), the daughter of Richard Thomas, alderman of Truro. The Polwheles claimed descent from the chamberlain of the Empress Matilda, Drogo de Polwhele, on whom a grant of Cornish lands had been bestowed in 1140. The family was long established in Polwhele, in the parish of St Clement, Cornwall, about 2 miles from Truro, and several of its members were among the Cornish representatives in parliament.<br>
<br>Polwhele was educated at Truro grammar school by Cornelius Cardew DD. He began to write poetry when about twelve years old, and his juvenile productions were praised by John Wolcot, then resident at Truro, but with some judicious qualifications. On his father's death in 1777 Polwhele accompanied his mother on a visit to Bath and Bristol, where he met many literary personages, including Catharine Macaulay and Hannah More. He presented the first of these ladies with an ode on her birthday, which was printed at Bath, with five others, in April 1777; and he was induced by the flattery of his friends to publish in the next year a volume of poems called <span class="italic">The Fate of Lewellyn</span>. The title-page concealed the author's name, stating that it was &#145;by a young gentleman of Truro School&#146;, whereupon a critic in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> stated that the master of that school should have kept it in manuscript, and Cardew retorted that he was ignorant of the proposed publication. This premature appearance in print impaired Polwhele's reputation.<br>
<br>Polwhele matriculated as commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, on 3 March 1778, and received from it two of Fell's exhibitions. He kept his terms until he was admitted a student in civil law, but he left the university without taking a degree. In 1782 he was ordained by Bishop Ross as curate to the Revd Thomas Bedford, rector of Lamorran, Cornwall, and in the same year married Loveday (1764/5&#150;1793), second daughter of Samuel Warren of Truro and his wife, Blanche Sandys, of an old Cornish family. They did not remain in Cornwall for long, as in the same year he was offered the curacy of Kenton, near Powderham Castle, Devon, the seat of the Courtenays. On 1 February 1793, however, his wife died at Kenton, aged twenty-eight, leaving one son and two daughters. Polwhele then moved with his children back to his mother's house in Cornwall, but after a short stay there returned again to Kenton. There, on 29 November 1793, he married Mary, the daughter of Captain Robert Tyrrell or Terrell of Exmouth, and early in 1794 he was appointed to the curacy of Exmouth. Both Kenton and Exmouth were close to Exeter, where Polwhele joined a literary society which published in 1792 <span class="italic">Poems Chiefly by Gentlemen of Devonshire and Cornwall</span> (2 vols.), edited by Polwhele, and in 1796 <span class="italic">Essays by a Society of Gentlemen at Exeter</span>. A quarrel over the second publication gave rise to a bitter controversy between Polwhele and his colleagues  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 66, 1796). Meanwhile he projected his <span class="italic">History of Devonshire</span>, and derived considerable assistance from the documents at Powderham, Mamhead, and Haldon, and from the diocesan records at Exeter. His list of subscribers was soon full, but the work proved unsatisfactory.<br>
<br>On the nomination of the bishop of Exeter, Polwhele was appointed in 1794 to the small living of Manaccan, near Helston, Cornwall, and he also undertook for a non-resident vicar the charge of the still smaller and poorer living of St Anthony in Meneage, to which he was appointed in 1809. The parsonage of Manaccan was a mere cottage, and Polwhele spent much time and money on repairs and enlargements. To secure the requisite education for his children, he accepted, about 1806, the curacy of the large parish of Kenwyn, within which the borough of Truro is partly situated, and obtained from the bishop a licence of non-residence at Manaccan. John Croker records in 1820 that Polwhele, who appeared &#145;to have very little worldly wisdom&#146;, was in trouble for restoring his church without proper authority, and that the parishioners had threatened him with legal proceedings  (<span class="italic">Croker Papers</span>, 1.165).<br>
<br>Polwhele was, by turns, poet, topographer, theologian, and literary chronicler, and his fame has been marred by a fatal fluency of composition. Before he was twenty he wrote, besides the works already mentioned, an ode called &#145;The Spirit of Frazer to General Burgoyne&#146; (1778) and an &#145;Ode on the Isle of Man to the Memory of Bishop Wilson&#146; for the 1781 edition of Wilson's works. His works are well documented in the <span class="italic">New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</span> (2.675&#150;77). Among his more noteworthy works of poetry are: <span class="italic">The Art of Eloquence</span>, a didactic poem, published in 1785, the later editions and following books being known as <span class="italic">The English Orator</span>, which was revised by Bishop Ross and others, and <span class="italic">Influence of Local Attachment</span> (1796, 1798, and 1810). This latter poem gave &#145;indications of a higher excellence&#146; which were not fulfilled  (Moir, 37). Long extracts from it are given in Nathan Drake's <span class="italic">Winter Nights</span> (2 vols., 1820), and it was compared by some of the critics to the <span class="italic">Pleasures of Memory</span> by Samuel Rogers. Polwhele's collection, <span class="italic">Poetic Trifles</span> (1796), was suppressed after a very few copies had been sold on account of its satirical references to Montauban (that is, Sir John St Aubyn). <span class="italic">The idylls, epigrams, and fragments of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus, with the elegies of Tyrtaeus</span> (1786) was often reprinted in the early nineteenth century, the translations of Tyrtaeus being included in a polyglot version published at Brussels by A. Baron in 1835.<br>
<br>One of Polwhele's poems attracted some attention in the twentieth century for its concern with the burgeoning debate of Polwhele's era concerning the essential nature and societal role of women. <span class="italic">The Unsex'd Females, a Poem</span> (1798) was reissued in facsimile as a part of the <span class="roman">Feminist Controversy in England 1788&#150;1810</span> series, edited by Gina Lurie, in 1974. In her introduction to the poem, Lurie explains how the relatively conservative Polwhele creates in it a dispute between Christ and the devil as embodied by the politically diametrical personalities of Hannah More and Mary Wollstonecraft.<br>
<br>Also reissued in facsimile in the twentieth century were Polwhele's two major topographical studies: <span class="italic">The History of Cornwall</span> (7 vols., 1816; repr. in facsimile, 3 vols., 1978) and <span class="italic">The History of Devonshire</span> (3 vols., 1793&#150;1806; repr. in facsimile, 1977). The style of his topographical volumes was attractive, and the descriptions of the places which he had himself seen were excellent. But the author was wanting in application, particularly with respect to his work on Devon; large districts of the county were unknown to him, and the topography was not described on an adequate scale. The historical section on Devon was followed by a querulous postscript with complaints of the withdrawal of subscribers and of the action of some of his friends in publishing separate works on portions of the history of the county. Much matter was omitted, particularly of the later history of Devon, and the whole work was a disappointment to both author and public, which was not mitigated by the separate publication of <span class="italic">Historical Views of Devonshire</span> (1793), of which four more volumes were announced, but only the first was ever published. Further information on these works will be found in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1793 and following years, and in William Upcott's <span class="italic">A Bibliographical Account of &hellip; English Topography</span> (1978, 1.150).<br>
<br>Polwhele's <span class="italic">History of Cornwall</span> also came out piecemeal in seven detached volumes from 1803 to 1808, and a new edition, purporting to be corrected and enlarged, appeared in 1816. The most useful of the volumes is the fifth, which deals with &#145;the language, literature, and literary characters&#146;. The editors of a 1994 study of English county histories observe that Polwhele's method &#145;was a considerable advance on that of his predecessors, being that of the historian-entrepreneur, taking advantage of the more widespread circulation of the printed word&#146; at this time  (Currie and Lewis, 119&#150;20). The complicated bibliography of his Cornish study can be seen in Boase and Courtenay's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Cornubiensis</span> (2.510&#150;11), the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1803&#150;4, Upcott's <span class="italic">English Topography</span> (1.88&#150;93), and in the 1978 facsimile reprint of <span class="italic">The History of Cornwall</span>. Polwhele also gave much assistance to John Britton in the compilation of the <span class="italic">Beauties of Cornwall and Devon</span> in the <span class="roman">Beauties of England and Wales</span> series (18 vols., 1801&#150;15).<br>
<br>Polwhele's <span class="italic">Traditions and Recollections</span> (2 vols., 1826) contains some civil war letters, anecdotes of Foote and Wolcot, and many of his own juvenile poems. His chief correspondents were Samuel Badcock, William Cobbett, William Cowper, Erasmus Darwin, William Hayley, Edward Gibbon, Catharine Macaulay, Sir Walter Scott, Anna Seward, and John Whitaker DD. A memoir by Polwhele of the last of these worthies formed the subject of the third volume of his <span class="italic">Biographical Sketches</span> (3 vols., 1831).<br>
<br>Polwhele also published, in connection with the Church Union Society, two prize essays (respectively on the scriptural evidence as to the condition of the soul after death, and on marriage), printed many sermons, and conducted a vigorous polemic against the Methodists. His chief opponent on this topic was Samuel Drew, who first confuted Polwhele's arguments and afterwards became his firm friend. Throughout his life Polwhele was also a contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and from 1799 to 1805 he was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>. He also supplied occasional articles to the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, and some of his poetry appeared in literary periodicals and annuals.<br>
<br>Polwhele vacated the living of Manaccan in 1821 on his appointment to the more valuable vicarage of Newlyn East, and he resigned St Anthony in favour of his eldest son, William, in 1828. Although he retained the benefice of Newlyn until his death, the last ten years of his life were spent on his estate of Polwhele, where he devoted himself to the composition of his autobiographical volumes. He died at Truro on 12 March 1838, and was buried near his father's grave in St Clement's churchyard, where a monument preserves his memory. With his second wife he had a large family; among the sons were Robert, vicar of Avenbury, Herefordshire, and author of some small theological works; Richard Graves, a lieutenant-colonel in the Madras artillery; and Thomas, a general in the army.<br>
