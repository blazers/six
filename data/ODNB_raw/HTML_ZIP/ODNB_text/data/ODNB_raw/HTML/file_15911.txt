<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lamb <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ponsonby]</span>, Lady  Caroline</span>  (1785&#150;1828), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in London on 13 November 1785, fourth child and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63967/', "Frederick Ponsonby, third earl of Bessborough (1758&#150;1844)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38506/', "Henrietta Frances Ponsonby (1761&#150;1821)")</script>, daughter of the first earl of Spencer and younger sister of the duchess of Devonshire. Her chaotic upbringing was cosmopolitan and cultured. As a young child, she accompanied her parents on a protracted tour of Italy. From the age of nine, owing to the ill health of her mother, she alternately ran wild with her cousins at Devonshire House or was restrained by sojourns with her austere grandmother Lady Spencer. She later regretted her lack of formal education (she seems briefly to have attended Miss Rowden's school, Hans Place, Kensington), for the family had been advised by Dr Warren, a specialist in nervous diseases, that study would exacerbate the violent mood swings which occasionally threatened her sanity. She grew up into a combination of bluestocking autodidact and tomboy: &#145;For myself, I preferred washing a dog, or polishing a piece of Derbyshire spar, or breaking in a horse, to any accomplishment in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lady Morgan's Memoirs</span>, 2.212). With her slight androgynous figure and cropped fair curly hair, she enjoyed dressing as a page-boy, as depicted in Phillips' famous 1814 portrait. A high-spirited eccentric who feared &#145;nobody except the devil&#146;, she read Mary Wollstonecraft's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span> in 1809 and &#145;became a convert&#146;  (ibid., 2.211). Lady Caroline was a brilliant conversationalist: &#145;A creature of caprice and impulse, and whim, her manner, her talk, and her character shifted their colours as rapidly as those of a chameleon&#146;  (Lytton, 1.119).<br>
<br>Caroline married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15920/', "Hon. William Lamb (1779&#150;1848)")</script> on 3 June 1805, and afterwards resided either in Melbourne House, Whitehall, or Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire. Their tempestuous marriage scandalized the nineteenth century, temporarily paralysing Lamb's political career. It was to be depicted in Thomas Lister's <span class="italic">Granby</span>, Benjamin Disraeli's <span class="italic">Vivian Grey</span> and <span class="italic">Venetia</span>, Mrs Humphry Ward's <span class="italic">The Marriage of William Ash</span>, Bulwer Lytton's <span class="italic">De Lindsey</span>, and Lady Lytton's <span class="italic">Cheveley, or, The Man of Honour</span>. Lady Caroline suffered the deaths of premature babies in 1806 and 1809; her only surviving child was a mentally handicapped son, Augustus, born on 29 August 1807. The marriage survived these tragedies and Caroline's subsequent open infidelities, the most notorious being a brief theatrical affair with Byron in 1812. She famously recorded her first impressions of the poet as, &#145;Mad, bad and dangerous to know&#146; and &#145;That beautiful pale face is my fate&#146;. So well did she forge Byron's handwriting that she fraudulently obtained from John Murray a miniature of the poet destined for her rival, Lady Oxford. In revenge for her dismissal by Byron she portrayed him as the satanic villain of an anonymous Gothic romance, <span class="italic">Glenarvon</span> (1816), written by night in male attire, and kept secret from her husband until the day of publication  (<span class="italic">Lady Morgan's Memoirs</span>, 2.202). As Byron sardonically commented, &#145;the time was well chosen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 5.85) to capitalize on the scandal surrounding his failed marriage. The <i>roman &agrave; clef</i> also lampooned the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93786', "Holland House set")</script>, and thus effected Lady Caroline's own ostracization from whig high society. William Lamb inaugurated but abandoned a legal separation; nor was he capable of halting publication of the book which publicized both his cuckoldry and the humiliating fact that his mother had also fallen under Byron's spell, becoming his &#145;greatest <i>friend</i>, of the feminine gender&#146;  (ibid., 6.23). Four British editions came out by 1817, the second of which was revised and included a justificatory preface. The novel was published in America and translated into French. It is still of interest as the first critique of Byronism and the Byronic hero by a woman writer. Byron commented: &#145;If the authoress had written the <i>truth</i>, &hellip; the romance would not only have been more <i>romantic</i>, but more entertaining. As for the likeness, the picture can't be good&#151;I did not sit long enough&#146;  (ibid., 5.131). In <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> he too satirized the Regency aristocracy, including Caroline. Lady Caroline responded to Byron's <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> with two anonymous <i>ottava rima</i> parodies: <span class="italic">A New Canto</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">Gordon: a Tale</span> (1821), and caused a sensation when she attended a masquerade dressed as Don Juan, escorted by a throng of devils.<br>
<br>Two more anonymous novels followed: <span class="italic">Graham Hamilton</span> (1822) and <span class="italic">Ada Reis</span> (1823). The latter, about an Englishwoman's love for a corsair, was printed by John Murray, formerly Byron's publisher. William Lamb had read the manuscript and advised on revisions. Lady Caroline also wrote verse for the annuals, some of which was set to music and posthumously published by Isaac Nathan in <span class="italic">Fugitive pieces and reminiscences of Lord Byron with some original poetry, letters and recollections of Lady Caroline Lamb</span> (1829). Increasingly ostracized by the aristocracy, Lady Caroline enjoyed the company of literary friends such as Lady Morgan. The Lambs also helped William Godwin and William Blake financially, and adopted a child, Susan Churchill. In 1824 they were riding near Brocket Hall and saw Byron's funeral cort&egrave;ge passing by on its way to Nottinghamshire. In 1825 William's family persuaded him to instigate a legal separation. Lady Caroline spent lonely drunken last years at Brocket Hall, likened to Bedlam by Emily Lamb, who unkindly referred to her afflicted nephew as &#145;Frankenstein&#146;. Her husband returned from his official duties in Ireland to be with her when she was dying, aged forty-two, of oedema. She died on 26 January 1828 in Melbourne House, and was buried in Hatfield church on 7 February.<br>
<br>Although Lady Caroline strove to be taken seriously as a writer, popular biographies and films continue to dwell on apocryphal stories of her scandalous escapades, such as the dinner party at which she had herself served up naked in a soup tureen. However, even her famous passion for Byron was literary in origin: she had first fallen in love with his hero, Childe Harold. In Robert Bolt's film, <span class="italic">Lady Caroline Lamb</span> (1972), she was played with some style by Sarah Miles.<br>
