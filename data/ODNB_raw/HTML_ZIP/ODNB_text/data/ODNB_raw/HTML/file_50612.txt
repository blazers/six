<span class="headword">Kyshe,  James William  Norton-</span>  (1855&#150;1920), <span class="occ">colonial official and legal writer</span>, was probably born in Mauritius, the second son of Henry Kyshe and Esther Norton. He once described himself as &#145;one of the Jewish race, closely connected to the Jews of the best birth and highest standing in England&#146;  (Wesley-Smith, 285), though the latter claim seems doubtful. First employed as a clerk in Mauritius, he was appointed deputy registrar of the supreme court of Penang in 1880. His call to the bar (Lincoln's Inn) in 1888 was followed by appointments as sheriff of Singapore (1892) and registrar of the supreme court of Hong Kong (1895). He left Hong Kong in 1904 on compulsory retirement, after many disputes with colleagues and an extraordinarily cantankerous episode involving the chief justice, William Meigh Goodman (1847&#150;1928). He had been diagnosed as suffering from nervous debility in Hong Kong and his retirement was on medical grounds: Colonial Office officials doubted his &#145;mental equilibrium&#146;, and in 1916 a receiver was appointed to administer his estate under the <span class="roman">Lunacy Acts</span>.<br>
<br>Intensely ambitious, arrogant, provocative, disputatious, tactless, paranoid, and utterly vain, Norton-Kyshe was described by Hong Kong civil servants and Colonial Office officials as a &#145;damned liar&#146; who &#145;fancies he is a man with a grievance&#146;, &#145;an impossible&#146; and &#145;bumptious man&#146; &#145;with an unwarrantably good opinion of himself&#146;, and &#145;a liar of the first water&#146; who &#145;has ability&#146; but &#145;no moral foundation&#146;. Norton-Kyshe, however, considered himself &#145;one of the greatest writers, if not <i>the</i> greatest, on legal matters in the Colonial Service&#151;not by any means a mere compiler&#146;  (Wesley-Smith, 279).<br>
<br>Norton-Kyshe's claim to fame rests, indeed, on his writings. His four volumes of Straits Settlements law reports (with extensive historical preface) and his index to Straits Settlements laws ensure that his name will forever adorn the Singapore and Malaysian legal systems. He wrote a number of rather forgettable books on such subjects as colonial attorneys-general and the law and custom relating to gloves, but his principal work is probably the two-volume <span class="italic">History of the Laws and Courts of Hong Kong</span> (1898). This tome, reprinted in 1971, is a major contribution to the colony's legal history. It is somewhat flawed, being perilously close to &#145;mere compilation&#146; of anything remotely connected to Hong Kong legal affairs, but it repays both light reading and careful study. Ironically he blamed it for causing great jealousy and animosity against him among government officials, yet both the book and its author were still referred to in late twentieth-century Hong Kong when his detractors were long forgotten.<br>
<br>Norton-Kyshe died of double pneumonia on 1 March 1920, at his home, 24 Victoria Road North, Southsea, Hampshire. He was married, with at least one son, though nothing further is known of his family; since his Mauritius pension was paid until 1936 it seems likely that his wife survived him until then.<br>
