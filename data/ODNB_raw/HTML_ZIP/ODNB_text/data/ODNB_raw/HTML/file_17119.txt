</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lubbock, Sir  John William</span>, third baronet  (1803&#150;1865), <span class="occ">astronomer and banker</span>, was born on 26 March 1803 in Duke Street, Westminster, London. He was the only child of Sir John William Lubbock, second baronet (1773&#150;1840) and Mary Entwistle (<i>d</i>. 1845) of Manchester. The elder Lubbock, the eldest of six children of William Lubbock (1746&#150;1823), inherited his baronetcy from his childless uncle Sir John Lubbock (1744&#150;1816) who helped establish the banking firm of Sir William Lemon, Buller, Edward Forster, John Lubbock &amp; Co. in 1772. This partnership, which Sir John Lubbock and Forster mainly ran after 1800, would later pass down to the younger J. W. Lubbock through his father.<h2>
<a name="Educationandbankingcareer"></a>Education and banking career</h2>Lubbock received his early education at Eton College and privately from William Maltby, and in 1821 convinced his father, who had intended to send him to Oxford, to enrol him instead at Trinity College, Cambridge. He spent more time studying astronomy and algebra with William Whewell and other younger Trinity fellows than he did cramming for the mathematical tripos, and graduated first senior optime in 1825. While an undergraduate he vacationed in Milan and Paris, where he steeped himself in the scientific and mathematical work of Laplace and Lagrange.<br>
<br>In 1827 Lubbock entered his father's banking firm at 15 Lombard Street, London, then known as Sir John William Lubbock, Forster &amp; Co. In 1833 he married Harriet Hotham (1810&#150;1873), daughter of a York military officer. This marriage produced eight sons (all of whom attended Eton) and three daughters, between 1834 and 1849. From 1827 to 1834 Lubbock's London address was 23 St James's Place, across from the Royal Society; between 1834 and 1840 he lived at 29 Eaton Place, London, and Mitcham Grove, Surrey. Upon succeeding to the baronetcy at his father's death on 22 October 1840, he moved his country home to High Elms, Farnborough, Kent. For the next twenty years he divided his weeks between working as senior partner of his bank in London and presiding over his estate in High Elms. Besides supervising the primary education of his own sons and establishing three village schools he spent his leisure time in Kent breeding sheep and cattle, planting conifers, and conversing with his neighbour Charles Darwin.<h2>
<a name="Scientificinterests"></a>Scientific interests</h2>Most of Lubbock's published work in science and mathematics appeared in the 1830s when he was still only a junior partner at the bank. In addition to original research on planetary motion, lunar theory, and tide tables, he played an important role in introducing British men of science to the work of Europeans, including the Frenchmen Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Phillippe de Pont&eacute;coulant, and Fran&ccedil;ois Pambour; the Italian astronomer Giovanni Plana; and the Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel. In his original scientific work Lubbock was consistently drawn to topics which allowed him to relate mathematical theories with observations that had been collected by practical men with little formal scientific training.<br>
<br>Lubbock contributed to a uniquely eclectic array of scientific societies. On the one hand he put in long hours at the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), Henry Brougham's project for making science intelligible to mechanics. On the other he was elected to the Royal Society in 1829, regularly read papers there in the 1830s, and served as its treasurer and vice-president from 1830 to 1835 and from 1838 to 1847&#151;a time when the society's aristocratic bent was under constant fire from reformers like Charles Babbage. He also regularly contributed to the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), which he joined in 1829, and belonged to the Geological Society of London (to which he contributed only one paper, on the climatic effects of the earth's rotation). And, while he was much less active in the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) than most of his friends, Lubbock did serve occasionally as vice-president of section A (astronomy), and he gladly accepted a BAAS grant in 1834 for his tidal research, although he published the findings in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> rather than the annual BAAS <span class="italic">Report</span>. Less formally Lubbock maintained a lengthy correspondence with several important men of science including Babbage, Whewell, John Herschel, and Augustus De Morgan, some of whom failed to agree about very much apart from their friendship with Lubbock.<br>
<br>One of the founders of the SDUK's <span class="italic">British Almanac</span> in 1827, Lubbock contributed an article on tides to its <span class="italic">Companion</span> in 1830, which he continued to update for the rest of the decade and revised as <span class="italic">An Elementary Treatise on the Tides</span> in 1839. In 1830 he also published for the SDUK with J. E. Drinkwater (later Lord Bethune) the essay entitled <span class="italic">On Probability</span>, which expounded Laplace's probability theory with examples from horse-racing, juries, and life assurance; this was a popular version of a highly abstract pair of papers on probability theory which Lubbock had delivered to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1828&#150;9. A final SDUK project which Lubbock supervised in 1830 was the publication of a set of six star maps on the &#145;gnomonic projection&#146;, which displayed the constellations, in Lubbock's words, &#145;as they would be &hellip; by a Camera Lucida&#146;  (Lubbock, <span class="italic">The Stars</span>, preface). He also published articles in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> during the 1830s on cask-gauging and achromatic lenses, which combined esoteric forays into pure mathematics with respectful nods to the &#145;experience&#146; of barrel makers and lens grinders.<br>
<br>In most of his work on the practical applications of science Lubbock urged scientists to band together with artisans in order to dethrone what were, in his view, the inept and corrupt practices of untrained placemen who held official scientific jobs. In the 1830s he joined with John Herschel and Francis Baily to try to reform the Admiralty office and its nautical almanac, after failing in his attempt to win the post of superintendent of the almanac in 1831. And he sided with commercial actuaries against the census official John Rickman, whose overly optimistic population figures had failed to square with life assurance companies' tables of mortality. Lubbock also served, alongside Herschel and George Biddell Airy, on two royal commissions on weights and measures (1838&#150;41 and 1843&#150;54), which among other things recommended in 1853 that Britain switch to a decimal coinage. At the heart of his lifelong interest in the practical side of science was a sincere belief that skilled labourers, with suitable direction from their social superiors, could turn their practical knowledge into social and political progress. This belief also motivated him to stand, unsuccessfully, as a radical MP for Cambridge in 1832, to serve as the first vice-chancellor of London University (1837&#150;42), and to act as a treasurer of the Great Exhibition in 1851.<h2>
<a name="RoyalSocietyadministration"></a>Royal Society administration</h2>Yet, at the same time that he was working so diligently on behalf of populist causes in the 1830s, Lubbock was displaying similar levels of administrative and intellectual toil at the openly &eacute;litist Royal Society of London. Between 1831 and 1837 he published six papers in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (including the Bakerian lecture of 1836) that extended the work on tides he had commenced at the <span class="italic">British Almanac</span>. Together with William Whewell's concurrent work at the Royal Society and the BAAS, these papers did much to refine the methods of Daniel Bernoulli and Laplace for relating the moon's transit with observed tidal fluctuations. Lubbock's share of the labour consisted in tabulating large data series which had been privately collected by dock employees in London and Liverpool, then comparing their regularities with each other and with Bernoulli's predictions. He left to Whewell the more ambitious (and, for the time being, fruitless) task of co-ordinating a standardized set of tidal observations around the world in order to produce an accurate map of co-tidal lines for use in navigation. In addition to his tidal research, for which the Royal Society awarded him a medal in 1834, Lubbock published an important set of papers in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on physical astronomy. These investigations, which were also published in serial form by Charles Knight, supplemented Laplace's theories of planetary and lunar motion with a series of constants which made better allowance for disturbing forces.<br>
<br>As Royal Society treasurer, Lubbock worked closely with its librarian, James Hudson, at building up its collection of books and journals; besides charging Hudson with keeping the shelves full, he supervised as the librarian took round-the-clock meteorological measurements from the society's rooms in 1832. Lubbock's library work also led him to publish a short work <span class="italic">On the Classification of Different Branches of Human Knowledge</span> (1838), which originated in part from a dispute with the British Museum librarian Antonio Panizzi over the proper method of classifying books. Although his last published memoir in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> appeared in 1840, he continued to provide the society with referee reports (typically of a forbidding nature) into the 1850s.<h2>
<a name="Astronomy"></a>Astronomy</h2>The Royal Astronomical Society was the only group to which Lubbock continued to send papers into the 1860s. Most of his efforts followed on from his earliest interests in tightening the fit between existing physical laws and available observations. In a set of papers delivered to the RAS between 1829 and 1833 Lubbock derived cometary orbits from his new laws of planetary motion in order to predict more precisely where to look for Halley's comet upon its predicted return in 1835. His RAS paper on &#145;The theory of astronomical refractions&#146; (1855) summed up earlier findings he had published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> in 1840, in which he applied to astronomical observations Gay Lussac's law concerning the expansion of gases. Starting with this law and a set of observed pressures at different altitudes, he interpolated constants that could be used to correct for the distorting effect of atmospheric pressure, and thereby provide astronomers with more accurate angles of refraction. (In 1840, challenged by Sir James Ivory about the accuracy of these constants, Lubbock tried unsuccessfully to raise &pound;1500 for a ballooning expedition in order to confirm them.)<br>
<br>Lubbock's final RAS paper, &#145;On the lunar theory&#146;, restated the conclusions of his earlier Royal Society papers on the moon in order to claim priority for his own theoretical innovations, along with the empirical contributions of Plana and Pont&eacute;coulant, against recent claims made by the American astronomers M. F. Longstreth and Benjamin Peirce. In this paper he credited himself and his two European colleagues with &#145;bringing to perfection the solution of the problem of finding the longitude at sea by means of lunar observations&#146;  (Lubbock, &#145;Lunar theory&#146;, 12). For his work on lunar and planetary astronomy Lubbock was one of twelve astronomers who received a testimonial from the RAS in 1849 as part of a compromise stemming from the society's inability to decide which of the co-discoverers of Neptune (J. C. Adams or U. J. J. le Verrier) should receive its annual medal.<h2>
<a name="BankingandCitylife"></a>Banking and City life</h2>Lubbock's scientific avocations, both in outlook and in their successful results, owed much to his equally successful vocation as a private banker in the City of London. He was one of London's leading financiers, both at the family bank and as a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance company. Lubbock's bank was a relatively small but very influential concern, which provided him with a prominent seat in the London Bankers' Clearing House and with easy access to polite society. He inherited his position on the court of directors at the Royal Exchange, like his senior partnership at the bank, upon the death of his father, who had been the insurance company's governor from 1838 to 1840. Lubbock became close friends with the firm's actuary, J. A. Higham, who abetted his lifelong interest in probability theory, and with the economist Thomas Tooke, its governor from 1840 to 1852.<br>
<br>Lubbock's day-to-day experience in the City served him well in his interactions with men of science. He frequently passed along to Babbage and Whewell information on commercial matters like prices and exchange rates, which were readily accessible in his capacity as a private banker but which were next to impossible for a gentleman of science to discover on his own. Lubbock also periodically sought jobs for relatives of his scientific friends, as when he lobbied the Royal Exchange in 1861 to hire John Herschel's son as a successor to Higham. Men of science were often quick to return the favour: Whewell, Babbage, and David Ricardo all offered their support when Lubbock stood for parliament in 1832. More generally he used his social connections in the City to gain access to much of the practical information (typically held in private hands) which he was forever squaring with scientific theory. Among other contacts Lubbock relied heavily in his scientific work on such men as Sir John Hall, secretary of the St Katherine's Dock Company, who relayed to Lubbock the practical wisdom of his dock master and harbour master; Isaac Solly, chairman of the London Dock Company, who handed over twenty-six years of private tidal data to Lubbock; Captain Eastfield of the East India Company, who superintended a year's worth of careful observations at Lubbock's behest; and M. J. F. Dessiou of the Admiralty office, who constructed many of the tables that Lubbock analysed.<br>
<br>Lubbock's scientific pursuits, however, did not always serve him so well at his desk in the City. He frequently complained that fellow financiers thought the less of him for his achievements in astronomy, and on the few occasions when he tried to apply scientific methods to financial questions the results were mixed at best. In his pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">On Currency</span> (1840), he used the latest algebraic techniques to determine that no firm predictions about the effects of competing monetary schemes could be reached without far more evidence&#151;a conclusion few financiers were interested in hearing in the midst of a heated currency debate. And in 1860 he presented a paper to the Institute of Actuaries which appealed to probability theory as a means of convincing London's leading banks to move their cash reserves from the Bank of England to a collectively held mutual fund&#151;a suggestion which none of his fellow bankers, who revered the bank as a symbol of financial stability, would take seriously for decades to come.<br>
<br>Lubbock's scientific and financial activities alike came to an abrupt end in 1860 when he was stricken by gout. That year Lubbock arranged for a merger between his bank and the London firm of Robarts, Curtis &amp; Co., a comparably influential Lombard Street concern which had been founded in 1791. Shortly after closing the deal, which created the new firm of Robarts, Lubbock &amp; Co., Lubbock passed along his senior partnership in the bank to his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34618/', "John Lubbock")</script>, who was already well on the way to inheriting his father's scientific laurels as well: the younger Lubbock, later Lord Avebury, would go on to a brilliant career as a banker, anthropologist, politician, and popularizer of science. In 1861 J. W. Lubbock resigned his directorship of the Royal Exchange, a post which was later taken up in 1865 by his third son, Neville Lubbock, who remained on the court until his death in 1914. Sir John William Lubbock spent the last five years of his life mainly at High Elms, where he died of heart disease on 20 June 1865.<br>
