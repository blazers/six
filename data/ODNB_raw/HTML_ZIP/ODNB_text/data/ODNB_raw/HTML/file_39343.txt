<span class="headword">Phillips, Sir  Lionel</span>, first baronet  (1855&#150;1936), <span class="occ">mining financier</span>, was born on 24 August 1855, at 36 Finsbury Circus, London, one of three sons of Jewish parents, Philip Saunders Phillips, sponge dealer, and his wife, Jane Lazarus. He had little formal education but, by means of private study, became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He worked as his father's bookkeeper and as a sorting clerk with a London diamond merchant, before settling in Kimberley in South Africa in 1875. Employed initially by J. B. Robinson successively as a diamond sorter, bookkeeper, publisher of his newspaper <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, and mine manager, Phillips became a haulage contractor after being ruined financially in the diamond-market crash of 1884. A second financial set-back forced him to accept the position of manager of the French and d'Esterre Company, which was absorbed in the formation of De Beers Consolidated Mines.<br>
<br>In recognition of his integrity, ability, and mining experience, Julius Wernher and Alfred Beit appointed Phillips in 1889 as technical adviser to H. Eckstein &amp; Co. (The Corner House), their gold-mining business on the Witwatersrand. Phillips arrived in Johannesburg in September 1889 with his two small sons and his wife, Dorothea Sarah Florence Alexandra (Florrie) Ortlepp (1863&#150;1940), a South African Christian, whom he had married on 22 August 1885. The couple later also had a daughter.<br>
<br>For Phillips the years 1890&#150;95 were among the most challenging and rewarding of his career. His recognition of the importance of deep-level claims and his astute business sense in acquiring them for his firm culminated in the successful proving of deep-level mining with the formation of Rand Mines Ltd in February 1893; he thus secured a dominant position for The Corner House and revolutionized the industry [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95075', "Randlords")</script>]. He became the first chairman of Rand Mines, and after the sudden death of Hermann Eckstein on 16 January 1893 succeeded him as head of the most powerful mining house on the Rand and as president of the chamber of mines, which office he held from 1893 to 1896, and from 1908 to 1909.<br>
<br>Having become a very wealthy and prominent man of the Rand with a socially ambitious wife, Phillips, with his family, moved in 1894 to Hohenheim (&#145;house on high&#146;), Parktown; this was the first of their grand homes, and they lavished on it vast amounts of money. However, their sumptuous lifestyle and their position as uncrowned &#145;king and queen of Johannesburg&#146; came to an abrupt end with the fiasco of the Jameson raid in December 1895. For his part in the conspiracy to overthrow the Kruger government, Phillips received the death sentence&#151;later commuted to a &pound;25,000 fine and banishment from the Transvaal in 1897.<br>
<br>Back in England, Phillips slipped comfortably into the roles of partner in Wernher, Beit &amp; Co. and country squire on his large Hampshire estate, Tylney Hall. He became lieutenant, justice of the peace, and high sheriff. In 1905 he was selected as the Conservative candidate for North Paddington, but he was forced to stand down before the election, owing to other commitments. In 1906 he returned to South Africa, at the request of Julius Wernher. He re-established himself as head of The Corner House and was again the undisputed leader of and spokesman for the mining industry. Since mid-1911 he had also been the vice-chairman of the Central Mining and Investment Corporation Ltd, successor to H. Eckstein &amp; Co., Johannesburg, and Wernher, Beit &amp; Co., London.<br>
<br>During their second sojourn in Johannesburg (1906&#150;14) the Phillipses resumed their former lifestyle, but this time at Villa Arcadia, situated just below Hohenheim. Having revived the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society, Phillips served as president from 1906 to 1924 and was awarded life presidency and honorary membership in 1935. In 1907 he was made honorary colonel of the Witwatersrand Rifles, a regiment originally recruited from the mines. Elected to the Union house of assembly from 1910 to 1915 as the Unionist Party representative for Yeoville, Phillips became the &#145;watchdog&#146; of the mining industry and piloted through parliament the legislation establishing the National Botanical Gardens at Kirstenbosch.<br>
<br>Phillips was awarded a baronetcy on 10 February 1912 for his public work. He played a prominent role in establishing the University of Cape Town and was a founder trustee of the Johannesburg Art Gallery. A contemporary described him as &#145;a shrewd and capable businessman whose chief interests, apart from business, lay in the direction of music and art&#146;  (Bell, <span class="italic">Bygone Days</span>). He was an accomplished musician who generously contributed time and money to many cultural, scientific and technical, and sporting bodies. A dark-haired, dapper man, immaculately groomed and with a twinkle in his eye, Sir Lionel Phillips was a keen sportsman, motorist, and traveller. He was described in 1910 as &#145;An able speaker, and a brilliant leader among the Rand Magnates&#146;  (Weinthal).<br>
<br>In December 1913 Sir Lionel was shot at several times and nearly killed outside the Rand Club by J. L. Misnun, a former hawker at one of the mines. Still weak from this ordeal he returned to London in 1914 to become chairman of the influential Central Mining and Investment Corporation. During the First World War a wing of Tylney Hall was converted into a hospital for officers and Sir Lionel was appointed a member of the Imperial Munitions Committee, which was concerned with the development of Britain's mineral resources. He resigned from Central Mining in 1924 and retired to the historic Cape farm, Vergelegen, which he had purchased for his wife Florrie on 31 March 1917. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Some Reminiscences</span>, was published in 1924, and <span class="italic">Transvaal Problems: some Notes on Current Politics</span> came out in 1905. His younger son Francis (Frank) was a businessman and the chairman of Central Mining from 1934 to 1942, when he suddenly died. The elder son, Harold Lionel Phillips, a farmer, had died in 1926. The youngest child was Edith Minnie (Edie) Phillips.<br>
<br>Li Phi, as Phillips was known, had lost an eye in a shooting accident, and his &#145;indigestion&#146; was finally diagnosed as stomach cancer. He died in the Cape Province at Vergelegen, Somerset West, on 2 July 1936 from cancer, and his ashes were interred next to the burial place of his son Harold, at Brixton cemetery, Johannesburg, in January 1938. General Smuts paid him the following tribute: &#145;In a very true sense, the Rand can be said to be, in part at least, a monument to his genius and efforts&#146;  (Smuts, 15).<br>
