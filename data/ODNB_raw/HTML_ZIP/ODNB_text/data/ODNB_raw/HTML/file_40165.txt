<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Muggeridge,  (Thomas) Malcolm</span>  (1903&#150;1990), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 24 March 1903 in Croydon, Surrey, the third of five sons, one of whom died in 1922 (there were no daughters), of Henry Thomas Benjamin Muggeridge, Labour politician, and his wife, Annie Booler, from Sheffield. His father, elected MP for Romford in 1929, was a self-educated Fabian with an unwavering dedication to socialism. He was the formative influence on his son's early years and as a small boy Malcolm accompanied him on his street-corner electioneering. After attending Selhurst grammar school, Muggeridge went to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he studied natural sciences but left with a pass degree (1923). It was here that, under the influence of Alec Vidler (a lifelong friend) and later of Wilfred Knox, his religious instincts were first aroused and he even thought at one stage of following Vidler into the Anglican ministry. However, he opted instead for a teaching post at Union Christian College, Alwaye, near Madras, India, where he remained for two years (1925&#150;7).<br>
<br>But Muggeridge was perpetually restless and, after quarrelling with the college principal, he returned to England and took a job as a supply teacher in Birmingham. Shortly afterwards, in 1927, he married Katherine Rosalind 
    (Kitty; <i>d</i>. 1994)
  , daughter of George Cumberland Dobbs (an employee of the famous travel agent Sir Henry Lunn) and his wife, Rosie, the youngest sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36799/', "Beatrice Webb")</script>. Kitty thereafter was to be the only permanent fixture in his life.<br>
<br>Muggeridge taught English for a time at Cairo University (1927&#150;30) and while there began to submit reports of the Egyptian political scene to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. In August 1930 he arrived in Manchester and was recruited on to the staff of the paper as a leader writer, on the recommendation of Arthur Ransome. He would perhaps have risen high on the staff but for the sudden death by drowning of E. T. Scott, who took over the editorship from his famous father C. P. Scott. Muggeridge had developed a strong antipathy to Scott's successor, W. P. Crozier, and was in a mood of disappointment following the formation of the National Government in 1931. In September 1932 he and Kitty decided to go and live in Russia, which they regarded, like many young nonconformists of the time, as the new Jerusalem.<br>
<br>Muggeridge, however, was quickly disillusioned, and after reporting first hand on the Ukraine famine&#151;almost the only western journalist to do so&#151;he went to Switzerland and worked for the League of Nations. In 1934 he took a job in India as assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Calcutta Statesman</span> and then worked for a short time on the staff of the London <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. Muggeridge always chafed at being a mere journalist and had already written a play and three novels (one of which, <span class="italic">Picture Palace</span>, a satirical account of his time on the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, had been recalled and suppressed by the publisher). In 1936, encouraged by his great friend Hugh Kingsmill, he abandoned full-time journalism and went to live at Whatlington in Sussex. In 1936 he published a critical biography of Samuel Butler and in 1938 another novel, <span class="italic">In a Valley of this Restless Mind</span>. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Thirties</span> (1940), a social survey of the decade, which first revealed his formidable powers as a political satirist and was remarkable for its anarchic wit and skilful use of quotation (a hallmark of Muggeridge's style).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War Muggeridge joined the intelligence corps and after a few months was transferred to MI6. He was sent to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique, where he proved an effective agent in the fight to prevent the sinking of allied shipping by German U-boats. He also served in north Africa, Italy, and, at the end of the war, in Paris, where he was instrumental in protecting P. G. Wodehouse, then under suspicion of collaborating with the Germans. He was decorated with the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and the Croix de Guerre with palm.<br>
<br>Muggeridge always liked to swim against the tide and in 1945 joined the Conservative <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> as a leader writer. He then became the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span>'s Washington correspondent (1946&#150;7). He was the paper's deputy editor from 1950 to 1952. Later that year, to universal surprise, he accepted the editorship of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, the first non-member of staff ever to do so. He proved an effective editor, transforming the staid old periodical with his lively and satirical journalism. But, after an initial rise, the circulation fell again and Muggeridge resigned in 1957. By now he was already involved in television as a presenter of the BBC's <span class="italic">Panorama</span>, a magazine programme devoted to politics and the arts. Muggeridge had a natural flair for television and with his outspoken views, drawling voice, and long cigarette holder quickly became a household name. Briefly suspended by the BBC in late 1957, after he had published in the USA an article attacking the cult of monarchy, he appeared on a wide variety of programmes throughout the 1960s and 1970s, notably a series of autobiographical documentaries, including <span class="italic">Twilight of Empire</span> and <span class="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen it is my Pleasure</span>&#151;an account of a lecture tour in America. He appeared as himself in the notable Boulting brothers' film <span class="italic">I'm All Right Jack</span> (1959).<br>
<br>All his life Muggeridge had been restless, dissatisfied, and tormented by strong appetites for women and drink. At about the age of sixty he made a series of renunciations&#151;of drinking, meat-eating, smoking, and casual love affairs. He and Kitty had finally settled at Park Cottage in Robertsbridge, an idyllic setting at the end of a long farm track in the Sussex countryside. Here Muggeridge experienced for the first time a degree of contentment and peace. He developed a routine of early rising, writing, and long walks (in which visitors were expected to join). He rediscovered his faith and became in print and on television a formidable apologist for Christianity. He was the first to introduce Mother Teresa to a worldwide audience with his film <span class="italic">Something Beautiful for God</span>, later published in book form (1971). Muggeridge was received into the Roman Catholic church in 1982.<br>
<br>Muggeridge was a man of middle height, with bright blue eyes and a bulbous nose. He had an enormous vitality and charm and was blessed with generous instincts which usually won over even his fiercest opponents (of whom there were many). He had no ambition for office of any kind and generally acted on impulse. His enormous success as a television personality came about by chance and may have encouraged a natural vanity. But he never lost the ability to laugh at himself. He was sustained throughout his life by the love of his wife. They had three sons and a daughter. Muggeridge died of bronchopneumonia on 14 November 1990 at Ledsham Court, The Ridge, Hastings, after a long decline and was buried near his father in Whatlington. Kitty Muggeridge died in 1994 in Welland, Ontario, Canada.<br>
