<span class="headword">Lowke,  Wenman Joseph  Bassett-</span>  (1877&#150;1953), <span class="occ">model-maker and businessman</span>, was born Joseph Wenman Bassett Lowke at 13 Kingswell Street, Northampton, on 27 December 1877, the elder son of Joseph Tom Lowke, agricultural engineer, and Eliza Goodman. He was educated at Kingswell Street College and All Saints' Commercial School until the age of thirteen. He worked for his father in the firm of J. T. Lowke &amp; Sons, engineers and boilermakers, of Northampton, founded as Bassett &amp; Sons by his stepgrandfather in 1859. He soon left to work for an architect but, after eighteen months, returned to his father's firm.<br>
<br>There, with Harry Franklin, the company's bookkeeper, Lowke took up model engineering, making small engines and boilers. He spent two years, 1898&#150;1900, as a student apprentice with Crompton &amp; Co. Ltd of Chelmsford; during that time, in 1899, he founded the firm of Bassett-Lowke &amp; Co., so named to distinguish it from his father's firm. At the same time he adopted this as his own surname. Franklin helped to run the nascent company, a small, mail-order business selling component parts for model engines. In 1898 Bassett-Lowke had forged a relationship with Percival Marshall, editor of the new magazine <span class="italic">Model Engineer and Amateur Electrician</span>. He was thus soon able to advertise regularly and reach a wide public. His first catalogue appeared in 1900, the year in which he made, at the Paris Exhibition, important contacts with Bing Brothers and Carette &amp; Cie, both of Nuremberg, who were able to manufacture and supply steam engines of British railway design to a standard of precision not yet achieved in Britain.<br>
<br>With works established in Northampton and with the supply of parts from abroad and from such home suppliers as Cornish and Claret, business flourished. Always a prolific writer, Bassett-Lowke, known to his friends as Whynne and to his employees as Mr Whynne, contributed articles to numerous magazines and produced many brochures. The first edition of <span class="italic">Model Railway Handbook</span> which he edited appeared in 1906, and it passed through countless editions until 1953. Bassett-Lowke's first retail shop was opened in High Holborn in London in 1908, and others were subsequently opened in Edinburgh and Manchester. The business became a limited liability company in 1910 as it branched out from model railways and stationary engines into flying machines, electrical equipment, and, especially, ships. A miniature railway run at Blackpool from 1905 to 1910 was highly successful. From 1911 there were regular contracts with the Admiralty. Bassett-Lowke was able to anticipate trends and so to diversify and establish subsidiary companies to supply and market a vast range of products. He &#145;was like a magnet, drawing to him all the best craftsmen, engineers, draughtsmen and designers&#146;  (Fuller, 330).<br>
<br>After the First World War the field of exhibition and industrial models was greatly expanded. Railway and shipping companies asked Bassett-Lowke to supply training models, and electricity in models was developed. His company, Narrow Gauge Railways Ltd, re-created and ran the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway from 1915 to 1925. He lectured and broadcast, and the name Bassett-Lowke became renowned to museums, institutions, companies, and collectors across the world. In the Second World War Bassett-Lowke was called upon by the services to provide countless training models of vessels and models of Mulberry harbours, Bailey bridges, and landing equipment for vital operational planning purposes.<br>
<br>In 1912 Bassett-Lowke, earlier a member of the Fabian Society, joined the Labour Party. George Bernard Shaw was a close friend who sometimes stayed with him in Northampton. Bassett-Lowke was a town councillor in Northampton from 1930 and an alderman from 1945. In 1948 he declined an invitation to be mayor, not wishing to sit on the bench and pass judgment on others. He served a number of committees and was successful in having the council build a modern public baths. He was a founder member of the town's Rotary Club, of which he was president in 1934, and founder director of its repertory theatre; he enjoyed taking part in amateur dramatics. Northampton Central Museum and Art Gallery has a three-view oil painting of him by John A. A. Berrie.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1917 Bassett-Lowke married Florence Jane, daughter of shoe manufacturer Charles Jones. There were no children. Bassett-Lowke was a founder member of the Design and Industries Association and was always interested in architecture: he had Charles Rennie Mackintosh carry out alterations to his first marital home, and in 1926 his second was designed by Peter Behrens. As a young man he was interested in swimming and cycling. He had a lifelong interest in photography, both still and cine, becoming vice-president of the Institute of Amateur Cinematographers. Throughout his life he was a great traveller, both on business and for pleasure. In 1904 he became a member of the Junior Institution of Engineers and, in 1911, of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers. He was the first president of the Model Engineers' Trade Association. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1946. In the last two years of his life Bassett-Lowke showed marked signs of senility. He died at St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, on 21 October 1953 of broncho-pneumonia. He was buried at Billing Road cemetery, Northampton, on the 23rd. His wife survived him.<br>
