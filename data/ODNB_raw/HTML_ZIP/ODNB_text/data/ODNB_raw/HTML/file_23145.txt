<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rapin de Thoyras <span class="st"> [Rapin]</span>,  Paul  de</span>  (1661&#150;1725), <span class="occ">army officer and historian</span>, was born in Castres, France, on 25 March 1661, the third of the six children of Jacques Rapin, sieur de Thoyras (1613&#150;1685), an advocate, and Jeanne P&eacute;lisson (<i>d</i>. 1706). He came from a protestant Savoyard family who had emigrated to France in the reign of Fran&ccedil;ois I and settled in Languedoc. His father practised law in the chamber of the edict of Castres, and his mother was a daughter of a councillor in the same court. The young Rapin, reportedly a serious and studious child, was educated at the Huguenot academies of Puylaurens and Saumur. In 1679 he was received as an advocate, although in all his life he is said to have only pleaded one case. The same year the court of Castres, which had been set up as a result of the edict of Nantes, was abolished and the Rapin family moved to Toulouse.<br>
<br>In 1685 Rapin's father died, and the revocation of the edict of Nantes forced the family to flee Toulouse for the country. In March 1686 Rapin and his younger brother Salomon went to London, where the connections between his uncle Paul P&eacute;lisson and the French ambassador, Paul Barillon, secured a favourable welcome. Despite the best efforts of his uncle, the ambassador, and the ambassador's circle, Rapin resisted conversion to Catholicism, and as a result failed to gain advancement in the England of James II. In 1688 he went to the Netherlands where he enlisted in a company of French refugee volunteers at Utrecht commanded by his cousin, Daniel de Rapin. In November 1688 this company formed part of the army that landed with William of Orange at Torbay. For both British whigs and Huguenots, William was the focus of protestant resistance to French and English Catholicism, and Rapin's part in the battles of the revolution of 1688 did much to form his version of British history. He became an ensign in Lord Kingston's regiment of foot and was part of the force sent to Ireland under the duke of Schomberg. He fought at Carrickfergus and the Boyne, and was shot in the shoulder with a musket-ball in the unsuccessful assault on Limerick in August 1690. In June 1691 he took part in the capture of Athlone, and was stationed at Kinsale. Rapin later wrote that it was here, under the influence of the governor of Kinsale, James Waller, that he first had the idea of writing a history of England, to explain to the other peoples of Europe the significance of the events he was taking part in.<br>
<br>In 1693, while still at Kinsale, Rapin was offered, at the recommendation of the marquis de Ruvigny, the post of governor to the eleven-year-old Lord Woodstock, the son of Hans Willem Bentinck, first earl of Portland. Rapin was described at this time as having &#145;un certain air du beau monde et ces mani&egrave;res nobles et ais&eacute;es qu'on n'attrape qu'avec gens de qualit&eacute;&#146;  (Trevor-Roper, 7). It was apparently at the urging of William III himself that Rapin accepted the post, and he spent the next thirteen years living in England and The Hague. In 1698, after the treaty of Ryswick, he accompanied Portland on an embassy to the court of Versailles. In 1699 he married Marie-Anne Testart (<i>c</i>.1674&#150;1749), who was described as &#145;jeune, riche et surtout vertueuse&#146;  (ibid., 9); she came from a Huguenot family in St Quentin which had sought refuge in the Netherlands. In January 1700 Marie-Anne gave birth to Jeanne-Henriette (1700&#150;1782), the first of twelve children, seven of whom survived infancy. But in 1701 the family life was disrupted, as Rapin was obliged to accompany the eighteen-year-old Lord Woodstock on his grand tour through Germany, Austria, and Italy&#151;an experience which, Rapin's surviving letters in Nottingham University Library suggest, he found something of a trial.<br>
<br>The time Rapin spent at The Hague provided him with the company of distinguished Huguenot scholars and intellectuals. As a member of a literary club known as La Pl&eacute;&iuml;ade (later La F&eacute;aut&eacute;), which met at Rapin's elegant house in The Hague, he regularly met Abel Rotolp, sieur de la Dev&egrave;ze, Henri Basnage de Beauval, Jacques Basnage, and Jean Rou (who gives an account of Rapin at this time in his <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires</span>). Rapin wrote an unpublished poem, &#145;Satire on la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de la Haye&#146;, in 1706, and so was clearly nursing literary ambitions. In 1702 his pension of 1100 florins a year, granted him by William III, ceased upon the monarch's death. In 1704 his employment with the Portlands ended when Lord Woodstock married, moved to England, and became MP for Southampton. Rapin now had the freedom to pursue his historical studies, which he appears to have begun in 1705, although his circumstances now required a less expensive way of life, especially in the light of his ever-expanding family. In 1707 he moved to Wesel with his wife and children, a cheaper although less cosmopolitan and sophisticated alternative to The Hague.<br>
<br>Rapin's Huguenot connections, however, continued to support him. In 1704 Jean Leclerc (with whom Rapin had studied at Puylaurens) received the first volume of Thomas Rymer's <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, a collection of transcripts of British treaties, letters, and acts which Rymer had compiled, and was now sending for a review in Leclerc's <span class="italic">Bibliot&egrave;que choisie</span>. Leclerc reviewed the first volume but sent the subsequent ones to Rapin, whom he described as &#145;a gentleman of merit who is working on the history of England&#146;  (Trevor-Roper, 12). Rapin produced abstracts of these acts for Leclerc's publication, and by 1708 had completed the first eight volumes. By 1725 he had completed seventeen, and these abstracts were published in an English translation by Stephen Whateley as <span class="italic">Acta regia, or, An account of the treaties, letters and instruments between the monarchs of England and foreign powers, published in Mr Rymer's Foedera</span> (1726). This privileged access to historical material provided the source for Rapin's history. &#145;I am convinced&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that there is not one piece in the <span class="roman">Foedera</span> but what may be of use, especially to such as would write the History of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acta regia</span>, 104), and he was spurred on to a more ambitious history than he had hitherto envisaged.<br>
<br>In 1717 Rapin's first effort to formulate his vision of the pattern of British history came in his <span class="italic">Dissertation sur les whigs et les tories</span> (La Haye, 1717), in which he attempted to explain, for the benefit of continental Europeans, the British party system. The translation of the work into German, Dutch, Danish, Spanish, and English provides some indication of the work's accessibility and lucidity. But it was apparently at the instigation of an Englishman, Andrew Fountaine, that Rapin published the work, and in England it became a standard, if whig-slanted, elucidation of a post-revolution construction of the national past.<br>
<br>Rapin had let it be known in 1714 that he was working on a history of England, and by 1717 he had written at least the first two volumes covering the Anglo-Saxons to the reign of William the Conqueror; in 1722 he had reached the year 1640. After publishing extracts in Leclerc's <span class="italic">Bibliot&egrave;que germanique</span> and in <span class="italic">Bibliot&egrave;que ancienne et moderne</span>, Rapin published the first eight volumes of his <span class="italic">Histoire d'Angleterre</span> in The Hague in 1723. Two more volumes were published in 1725, taking the history down to the coronation of William and Mary. Rapin, however, did not live to see the full extent of his success as in 1725 he fell ill with a stomach condition and a fever. He died after a week's illness on 16 May 1725 in Wesel and was buried there. He was survived by his wife, six daughters, and one son, Jacques-Benjamin (1707&#150;1763), who became a Prussian official. Details of Rapin's life were published first in an essay by his elder brother, Charles Rapin-Puginier (1658&#150;1730), and later in the laudatory history of the Rapin family by Raoul de Cazenove, which reprints a great deal of Rapin's correspondence.<br>
<br>Rapin's contemporaries depicted him as &#145;naturally of a serious temper&#146;  (&#145;Life of Rapin&#146;, no pagination), a man of culture, music, and reason, as well as adept in Italian, Spanish, English, Greek, and Latin. His stern features, with his robust and strong complexion, and his penetrating gaze, can be seen in his portrait, appended to numerous editions of the <span class="italic">History of England</span>, in which he rests his armoured arm on a pile of his own history books.<br>
<br>The subsequent history of Rapin's magnum opus in England is no less remarkable than his life. His text was politically suited to the times, and stylistically amenable to the British public. The <span class="italic">History</span> formulated the English past as an essential struggle between the &#145;prerogatives&#146; of the crown and the &#145;privileges&#146; of the people. When the two are in balance &#145;liberty&#146; is maintained. The perfect system of government was parliamentary and constitutional, and had been established by the Saxons in England, who, after their invasion in the fifth century, established a &#145;Wittenagemote&#146;, which Rapin depicts as an early form of parliament. All upheavals since that establishment were simply instances of the ongoing struggle to maintain this Saxon system, of which the revolution of 1688 was just the most recent example. Although intended for &#145;foreigners&#146;, the work simplified the system for the English market, and Rapin's eclectic style, veering between the painstaking elucidation of historical documents (for instance his essay on the Salic law) and the bloodthirsty sensationalism of a novelist, endeared him to London booksellers. The first translation, by Nicholas Tindal, appeared in fifteen volumes between 1725 and 1731, and was challenged by a translation by John Kelly (1732&#150;6). The text was issued in all the possible forms that booksellers had at their disposal, including part-books, continuations by David Durand (1734&#150;5), Thomas Lediard (1736 onwards), and Tindall (1744&#150;5), and a schoolbook adapted from Rapin by John Lockman, <span class="italic">The History of England by Question and Answer</span> (1739). The wealth of romantic and gory stories in the original text made it an attractive option for illustration, and the first versions provided work for London's illustrators. George Vertue's <span class="italic">Heads of the Kings of England Proper for Rapin's History</span> (1736) fulfilled a Georgian taste for grangerization, while the elaborate decorations for the third edition (1743&#150;7) were important forebears of the British &#145;history painting&#146;. Artists such as Angelica Kauffman later cited Rapin as the source for their subjects.<br>
<br>Rapin's initial critics objected to the clear whig slant of the <span class="italic">History</span>, as in the case of the splenetic <span class="italic">Defence of English History Against the Misrepresentations of M. de Rapin-Thoyras</span> (1734), which criticized the history as anti-monarchical, anti-church, and &#145;the sweet singing of anarchy and levelling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Defence</span>, 8). Rapin's chief political champion was Lord Bolingbroke, who plundered the <span class="italic">History</span> for his own <span class="italic">Remarks on the History of England</span>, directed towards the political struggle against Robert Walpole. The wide distribution given to Rapin's text and ideas in the 1730s established the <span class="italic">History</span> as a classic, and continued versions were appearing until the 1780s. Rapin's hegemony in British historiography was ultimately usurped by David Hume, whose own <span class="italic">History of England</span> (1754&#150;62) superseded Rapin's as the standard work. Hume later described the Frenchman as &#145;despicable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 258), both in style and content, and ultimately it was the more literary, less politically engaged, philosophical tenor of Hume's <span class="italic">History</span> that was appreciated by the later Georgian readership. Nevertheless, Rapin's work remains a key milestone in British historiography, political thought, and bibliography, and its author as deserving of scholarly attention as his successors.<br>
