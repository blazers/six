<span class="headword">O'Neill,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1858), <span class="occ">shoemaker and writer</span>, was born in Waterford city, Ireland, on 8 January 1778, the second son of Thomas O'Neill (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1810), a poor shoemaker, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> English (1756/7&#150;<i>c</i>.1828). John O'Neill finished his formal schooling at the age of nine and was largely self-educated. He worked as a shoemaker in Ireland, and married Mary Dollard (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1823) in Carrick-on-Suir, co. Tipperary, about 1800. He began to try his hand at writing while working at the boot and shoe trade, and while he dreamed of literary success, after emigrating to London in 1808, he quickly joined the capital's community of shoemakers and successfully tracked down his father, who had deserted the family some thirty years earlier. After the death of his first wife O'Neill married Ann Bass, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lester (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1864), the widow of David Bass, on 30 January 1824 in St Anne's Church, Soho.<br>
<br>O'Neill managed to combine his trade with literary activity and was known in his lifetime primarily as a writer of temperance poetry, especially <span class="italic">The Drunkard</span>, which he wrote soon after becoming a teetotaller in 1840 (although he had never been an especially heavy drinker). The poem was dedicated to Father Mathew, the foremost teetotaller of his day, and it earned O'Neill the unofficial title of the laureate of the temperance movement; many reformers saw it as a vividly memorable account by a labouring-class author of the ruin brought by drink to a young working man and his family. The edition of 1842 was illustrated by George Cruikshank, who later produced his own series of popular illustrations on the same topic, entitled <span class="italic">The Bottle</span>. Robert Cruikshank, brother of the illustrator, produced a portrait of O'Neill which was engraved by Charles Wagstaff to form a frontispiece to <span class="italic">The Drunkard</span>, later renamed <span class="italic">The Blessings of Temperance</span>.<br>
<br>O'Neill was also the author of &#145;Fifty years' experience of an Irish shoemaker in London&#146;. This memoir was published eleven years after his death in forty-one weekly instalments (8 May 1869&#150;19 February 1870) in <span class="italic">St Crispin</span>, a weekly journal for the boot and shoe trade. Its proposed publication in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Struggling through Life</span> had been announced in 1856, but it remained unpublished in book form at the end of the twentieth century. The text describes O'Neill's struggle to survive when the shoemaking trade went into decline, telling of how he coped with injury and illness, letting rooms, and attempting to run a business of his own. All such enterprises were failures: O'Neill remained poor all his life. He also depicted family life in slum rooms at numerous addresses (especially around Clare Market and Drury Lane, but also in the Waterloo area), diet, clothing, entertainment in public houses and other places, parish relief, and finding work for his children. The death of his wife after giving birth to their thirteenth child is described, as is his second marriage, and the resultant six more children, as well as his responsibility for two stepchildren. He tells of how he wrote songs (including a popular drinking piece &#145;Trim the lamp; fill the bowl&#146;), occasional articles and poems, and an English stage version (published, but not performed) of the Spanish novel <span class="italic">Alva</span>. Folk-tales remembered from his youth were published in 1854 as <span class="italic">Handerahan, the Irish Fairyman; and Legends of Carrick</span>, with an introduction by Anna Maria Hall. Such work, in addition to <span class="italic">The Drunkard</span>, meant that his applications to the Royal Literary Society for loans and grants were generally successful.<br>
<br>John Bedford Leno, editor of <span class="italic">St Crispin</span>, singled out the importance of the memoirs when he noted in an editorial: &#145;To the historian of the future, the Reminiscences will be of immense value. Hitherto history has been too much confined and hence in searching for the records of a nation we find merely the history of its kings&#146;  (<span class="italic">St Crispin</span>, 19 Feb 1870, 85&#150;6). O'Neill died at his home, 20 White Horse Yard, Drury Lane, on 3 February 1858 and was buried in the St Pancras cemetery, Finchley, on 7 February.<br>
