<span class="headword">Harris,  John</span>  (1791&#150;1873), <span class="occ">artist and facsimilist</span>, was born on 17 November 1791 in Kennington, London, the son of the watercolour painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12400/', "John Harris (1767&#150;1832)")</script>, with whom he has often been confused. His grandfather was the entomologist and illustrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12413/', "Moses Harris")</script>.<br>
<br>Harris occasionally exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1810 and 1834. As an academy student he specialized in portrait miniatures, and with his father he executed the illuminations in the British Library vellum copy of John Whittaker's 1816 gold-printed <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. Harris worked for Whittaker, a printer and bookbinder, from 1815 until about 1820. By then he had also begun to produce the facsimile work for which he is principally remembered. Both Thomas Grenville and G. J. Spencer (second Earl Spencer) were among the collectors who employed him, and in 1854 Harris described himself in a manuscript memoir of his father as &#145;an Artist following a variety of branches connected with the Fine Arts, but priding himself more particularly upon executing fac-simile Leaves for perfecting rare old books&#146;  (Harvard U., Houghton L., Bi 65.820F*).<br>
<br>Harris married his wife, Mary, on 13 February 1820, and about the same time began his long association with the British Museum. In his memoirs Robert Cowtan described an incident in which the librarian Anthony Panizzi, along with two others, was unable to identify the facsimile leaves in a rare volume, and called in Harris to distinguish his own work, which he was able to do only after considerable examination of the book. On 8 July 1843, following this episode, the museum trustees at Panizzi's request ordered that Harris in future sign any leaf he restored with the formula &#145;This is by J. H.&#146;; other signatures used on facsimiles include &#145;F. S. J. H.&#146;, &#145;by H&#146;, and &#145;J. H.&#146;. Harris's unsigned work is often difficult to distinguish from an original, and his minute signature is sometimes overlooked, as when the British Museum for many years reproduced as genuine a signed Harris facsimile of the printer's device of William Caxton.<br>
<br>In 1851 Harris showed his facsimiles at the Great Exhibition; his own brief account of his technique and early work appears in the 1852 <span class="italic">Reports by the Juries</span>. By August 1856 he had become totally blind, and in 1858 an appeal for contributions on his behalf was launched in the advertisement columns of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Two years later Harris and his wife became residents of the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution for Aged Freemasons in Croydon; he had been an active freemason since 1818, and in 1849 had published a set of designs for lodge tracing boards, which became standard for many years. While resident at Croydon, where he died on 28 December 1873, Harris published two poems, <span class="italic">Lines on the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution</span>, sold in aid of the Freemasons' Life Boat Fund in 1871, and <span class="italic">Lines on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Wedding Day of John and Mary Harris</span> (1870). He left a daughter, Helen Caroline Martin, and a son, John Alfred, who for a time continued his father's business of supplying facsimiles.<br>
