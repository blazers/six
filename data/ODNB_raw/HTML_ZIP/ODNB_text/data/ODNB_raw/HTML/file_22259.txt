<span class="headword">Pike,  John Deodatus Gregory</span>  (1784&#150;1854), <span class="occ">minister of the New Connexion of General Baptists</span>, the eldest son of John Baxter Pike and his wife, Sarah Kirk, daughter of James Gregory, a London merchant, was born at Edmonton on 6 April 1784. He had six brothers and three sisters.<br>
<br>His father, <a name="cosubject_22258"></a><span class="headword">John Baxter Pike</span>  (1745&#150;1811), was the son of Thomas Pike, a class leader among the early Methodists, and his second wife, Eleanor. He was ordained a deacon in the Church of England, but subsequently came under the influence of Andrew Kippis (1725&#150;1795), and in 1777 became a Unitarian preacher. Later he fluctuated between Presbyterian and rationalist views, and for a time ran a boarding-school, first at Stoke Newington and later at Edmonton. About 1791, however, he was practising as a doctor in London, while his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1838), kept a girls' boarding-school at Enfield. Subsequently he appears to have taught &#145;geography and belles-lettres&#146; at his wife's school, but according to Watkins and Shoberl he was &#145;obliged to withdraw on a charge which affected him very seriously&#146;. He died at Edmonton on 11 December 1811, and was buried in East Barnet. He contributed letters on a variety of subjects, including horticulture and poultry farming, to the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>After being educated chiefly at home, the younger John Pike attended the nonconformist Wymondley College, London, from 1802 to 1806. Although he knew few Baptists, he studied their principles and was baptized in August 1804 by the General Baptist John Evans (1767&#150;1827) of Worship Street Chapel, London. Having declared himself a Baptist, however, he joined no church. On leaving the college he acted for three years as assistant classical master in a school kept by his uncles G. and R. Gregory at Lower Edmonton. In 1807, after exploring the possibility of membership in a Particular Baptist church, his firm belief in the availability of salvation for all led him to join the New Connexion of the General Baptists at the church of Dan Taylor (1738&#150;1816) in Whitechapel. He remained a General Baptist for the rest of his life. At Taylor's church he first began to preach, and in 1810 he accepted the pastorate of the Baptist church in Brook Street, Derby. On 22 June 1811 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1848), daughter of James Sandars of Derby, and they had four sons&#151;all of whom became Baptist ministers&#151;and two daughters. His ministry at Brook Street was very successful: a new chapel was opened in April 1815, three times as large as the first. Four years later it was enlarged, and in 1842 a larger building was secured at St Mary's Gate.<br>
<br>Pike's greatest achievement was the establishment of the General Baptist Missionary Society in 1816. The Particular Baptists had founded a missionary society in 1792 and Pike felt keenly the lack of a General Baptist equivalent. In 1809 he anonymously proposed to the annual association of the New Connexion that a missionary society be formed. Although nothing came of this initial suggestion, Pike laboured to raise enthusiasm for the missionary cause and, before he had obtained the pastorate at Brook Street, even contemplated becoming a missionary to Africa himself. In the early days of his ministry his church supported an Indian preacher connected with the Particular Baptist mission in Serampore. When the General Baptist Missionary Society was instituted, Pike was invited to become its secretary; he held the appointment until his death. He devoted much time and energy not only to attending society meetings and to handling correspondence from the missionaries in Orissa, north-east India, but also to preaching on behalf of the society. For some years he acted as tutor to prospective missionaries, lodging them in his own home. Although forward thinking on matters concerning foreign missions, he remained a staunch opponent of Catholic emancipation.<br>
<br>From 1822 to 1834 Pike was joint editor of the <span class="italic">General Baptist Magazine, Repository, and Missionary Observer</span>. He was best known for his <span class="italic">Persuasives to Early Piety</span> (1819), an evangelistic booklet for young people which appeared in several editions and was translated into French in 1841. <span class="italic">A Guide for Young Disciples of the Holy Saviour</span> (1823) was a popular sequel. Pike presented the copyrights of his most popular works to the Religious Tract Society and the American Tract Society in 1847. He died suddenly at Derby on 4 September 1854.<br>
