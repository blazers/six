<span class="headword">Hippisley,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">writer on trade and administrator in west Africa</span>, was baptized on 21 June 1729 at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13359/', "John Hippisley (1696&#150;1748)")</script>, an actor and theatre manager, and his partner, Mary Charley. Little is known of his early life and education. He played Tom Thumb in Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Tragedies</span> at Covent Garden in 1740 but otherwise seems not to have followed the theatrical life of his father and two sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13357/', "Elizabeth Hippisley (fl. 1742&#150;1769)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13358/', "Jane Hippisley (1719&#150;1791)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13359/', "Hippisley, John (1696&#150;1748)")</script>]. His later writing indicates an education that complemented an above-average intellect.<br>
<br>By the mid-century, probably through his family's Bristol connections, he was in the employ of the Committee of Merchants Trading with Africa, which had taken over the functions of the chartered Royal African Company in 1750. The committee was responsible for the forts in west Africa which (with the help of the Royal Navy) protected British interests in the slave trade. Its officers were few in number, mainly stationed in forts on the Gold Coast, and these Hippisley joined in a junior capacity at a salary of &pound;80 a year. The committee employed men of good education, from the middle class, and with respectable connections. Promotion was rapid, largely because of high mortality, and in 1751 he was in charge of the fort at Succondee. His record was not without blemish and in the following year he was reported for a misdemeanour and warned that he might be dismissed for further misconduct. He later served in Tantumquerry, Anamaboe and Winneba, but in mid-1760 he left the service, possibly dismissed for the sale of slaves, in which officers of the committee were forbidden to participate.<br>
<br>The next four years Hippisley probably spent as a merchant in Bristol, for he described himself as such in his will of 1764, though his name does not appear in the records of the city's Society of Merchant Venturers. Certainly he spent time preparing a slim volume of <span class="italic">Essays</span> which appeared in 1764, one among many publications in the eighteenth century on various matters relating to the slave trade. The first essay, &#145;On the populousness of Africa&#146;, is the most interesting and original, and one of the earliest extant discussions of this theme. It defended the need for the slave trade and the capacity of Africa to continue to supply this need, but it was no crude defence and displayed a level of knowledge and understanding of contemporary thinking, for example in references to Montesquieu's <span class="italic">Esprit des lois</span> and to certain medical matters. Hippisley was certainly influenced by the Enlightenment and, notwithstanding his activities, displayed a remarkable degree of humanity. The other essays are more polemical and less well written. &#145;On the trade at the forts on the Gold Coast&#146; argued that officers of the committee should be permitted to participate in the trade in slaves, and probably reflected his experience of dismissal from the service. &#145;On the necessity of erecting a fort at Cape Appolonia&#146; stressed the need for further protection of English interests against the Dutch and the French. The <span class="italic">Essays</span> have been frequently referred to by historians but remain to be examined in detail.<br>
<br>How he came to regain favour with the Committee of Merchants is not known, but in his will he stated that he was &#145;bound for the coast of Africa&#146;. His preferment was rapid and in March 1766 he became governor of Cape Coast Castle, the senior appointment on the Gold Coast, but his time in office was brief and he died there in August the same year. His death was recorded by Philip Quaque, then chaplain at the castle, in a letter dated 28 September, thus correcting a later announcement in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> that it took place in January 1767. Hippisley, he wrote, &#145;proved to us in all points a worthy friend &hellip; very humane and hospitable &hellip; a great observant of the public worship of Almighty God&#146;  (Priestley, 113&#150;14). Even with allowance for some overstatement (and Quaque was later suspended) these words match a view of Hippisley to be gained from his writing.<br>
<br>His estate, of which there are no details, went to his wife, Mary, whom he married in Bristol in 1764 and with whom he had a son. However, the Cape Coast Castle chaplain recorded that he christened in June 1766 a son of Hippisley, then twelve, borne presumably by his west African &#145;wench&#146;, as was common among Europeans on the Gold Coast at the time. Both sons carried their father's name.<br>
