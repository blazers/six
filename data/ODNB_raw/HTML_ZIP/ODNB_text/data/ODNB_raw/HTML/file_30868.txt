<span class="headword">Buchan,  Alastair Francis</span>  (1918&#150;1976), <span class="occ">writer on strategic and international affairs</span>, was born at 76 Portland Place, London, on 9 September 1918, the third son and the fourth and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32145/', "John Buchan, first Baron Tweedsmuir (1875&#150;1940)")</script>, and his wife, Susan Charlotte (1882&#150;1977), daughter of Captain Norman de l'Aigle Grosvenor, third son of the first Baron Ebury. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took second-class honours in modern history in 1939. After spending a short while at the University of Virginia, he was commissioned in the Canadian army in 1939 (his father being at that time governor-general of the dominion) and saw active service at Dieppe in 1942 and, as a major, in north-west Europe in 1944&#150;5. On 11 April 1942 he married Hope Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1997), daughter of David Gordon Gilmour, of Ottawa, Canada, lumberman. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After demobilization Buchan turned to journalism. He served as assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Economist</span> from 1948 until 1951, when he went to Washington as correspondent for <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. There he remained until 1955, observing at close quarters the political turmoil resulting from the Korean War and the witch-hunts initiated by Senator McCarthy. It was then that he laid the foundations of his expertise in the major problems of defence and nuclear armament that were of increasing concern to decision makers at this period in Washington and elsewhere; and his writing on this topic gained him the respect of senior officials and political figures, as well as his fellow journalists, in both the United States and Europe.<br>
<br>In 1955 Buchan returned to London and continued to work for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> as its diplomatic and defence correspondent. He was there able to pursue a private interest in the life and work of the founder of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, Walter Bagehot, which led to the publication in 1959 of an excellent brief study, <span class="italic">The Spare Chancellor</span>. But his main interest lay in the increasingly complex and controversial field of defence and nuclear deterrence, and he accepted with alacrity the invitation to become the first director of the newly formed Institute for Strategic Studies in 1958.<br>
<br>The object which the founders of the institute had in mind was to make generally available information on defence questions, in order to educate public opinion in a debate that was at that time engendering more heat than light. An essential element in this programme was to persuade responsible officials to release more information and share their concerns with a wider public. A difficult path had therefore to be trodden in order to retain the confidence both of Whitehall and of Fleet Street, and in this Buchan succeeded brilliantly. Further, his contacts in the United States enabled him to enlist the interest of such seminal strategic thinkers in that country as Bernard Brodie, Albert Wohlstetter, Thomas Schelling, and Henry Kissinger. European thinkers such as Raymond Aron in France and Helmut Schmidt in Germany were also drawn in. As a result the International Institute for Strategic Studies (as it later became) developed from a simple information centre into the principal forum of strategic debate in the Western world, where officials, journalists, academics, and military men met and freely exchanged ideas. To these ideas Buchan himself made a continuing contribution with his books and articles; but his real talents were entrepreneurial, the capacity to draw ideas out of others. The increasing intelligence and moderation with which such questions as nuclear deterrence, nuclear proliferation, and arms control were publicly discussed in the 1960s in all Western countries owed a very great deal to Buchan's influence.<br>
<br>Buchan retired from the directorship of the institute in 1969 to take up an appointment as commandant of the Imperial Defence College: the first non-official civilian ever to hold the post. Under his leadership the syllabus was broadened and the membership extended, its changed role being expressed in a new title: the Royal College of Defence Studies. In 1972, at the conclusion of his tour of duty, he became Montague Burton professor of international relations at Oxford, and began to develop a serious graduate school of international politics in that university. He had time barely to lay the foundations, however, when he died suddenly in his sleep on 4 February 1976, in his home, Waterloo House, Brill, near Oxford. His funeral was held in Brill on 10 February. A readership in international relations was established in his memory by Oxford University in 1980.<br>
<br>Although Eton and Christ Church had equipped Buchan with the agreeable worldliness of an upper-class Englishman, he was fundamentally a Scot, with formidable powers of work and a granite-hard integrity which impressed people even more than did his intellectual ability and the literary fluency he inherited from his father. He was appointed MBE in 1944 and CBE in 1968. In 1973 he gave the Reith lectures, with the theme &#145;Change without war&#146;.<br>
