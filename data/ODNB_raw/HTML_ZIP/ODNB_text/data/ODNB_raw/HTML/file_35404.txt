<span class="headword">Patel, Vithalbhai Jhaverbhai</span>  (1873&#150;1933), <span class="occ">Indian nationalist and politician</span>, the son of Jhaverbhai, a 10 acre farmer, and his wife, Ladba, was born on 27 September 1873 at his mother's home town of Nadiad and brought up in his father's village of Karamsad. Both of these places were in the rich farming tract of the Charotar, located in Kaira district, in central Gujarat (then in the Bombay presidency). He was the third of five brothers, the fourth brother being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35403/', "Vallabhbhai Patel (1875/6&#150;1950)")</script>, the future deputy prime minister of India. He was of the Patidar caste, the dominant agricultural community of the area and an important force in the political life of the region. His own family was of high status in the caste, but not affluent. He was married at the age of nine to Diwaliben (<i>d</i>. 1910) who came from nearby Sojitra. They had no children.<br>
<br>Vithalbhai broke with family tradition, studied English and became a pleader in local courts in Gujarat. He and Vallabhbhai, who followed in his footsteps, specialized in criminal law, gaining a reputation for being able to secure acquittals in even the toughest of cases. After a few years' practice they had earned sufficient money to be able to finance further legal studies in England, Vithalbhai going first and being called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1908. On his return to India he practised as a barrister in Bombay. He became involved in nationalist politics, and in 1911 he gave up his practice to become a full-time politician. He was elected to the Bombay legislative council in 1913, rising rapidly to prominence as a tireless opponent of British officialdom. He made vigorous attempts to secure for Indians a wider scope in public life. In 1918 he was elected to the central legislative council which sat in Delhi and Simla.<br>
<br>At this time the Indian nationalist movement was moving in a more radical direction under the leadership of M. K. Gandhi, and Patel, disappointed by the limited reach of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford constitutional reforms and the shameless reaction in right-wing circles in Britain to the Amritsar massacre of 1919, threw his support behind Gandhi, resigned his council seat, and became a leading figure in the non-co-operation movement of 1920&#150;22. Although he worked closely with Gandhi at this time, he was never a &#145;Gandhian&#146; in the sense of believing in non-violence as an absolute principle. After Gandhi called off the movement suddenly in 1922, he decided to return to legislative politics, even though this flouted the then Congress line. He was elected to the Indian legislative assembly in 1923, becoming its first Indian president (equivalent of speaker) in 1925.<br>
<br>Of this phase in his career it has been said that his venerable white-bearded appearance concealed a considerable fund of sheer <i>gaminerie</i>. His position allowed him to devise numerous means of harassing leading officials in the assembly and making the government of India look ridiculous. He was also instrumental in preventing the government from implementing repressive legislation designed to curb nationalist activity. In 1929 moves by supporters of the government to have him removed as president were thwarted only by the intervention of the viceroy, Lord Irwin, who was at the time trying to win over the radical nationalists to his side.<br>
<br>This Irwin failed to do, leading to Gandhi's launching of the civil disobedience movement in 1930. Patel resigned from the assembly in sympathy with this protest and was subsequently imprisoned. His health was deteriorating, and on his release in 1931 he went to Europe to seek medical aid. After stays in London and Vienna, he died in Geneva on 22 October 1933 and was cremated in Bombay on 10 November. In recognition of his great contribution to the Indian nationalist cause, a statue of him was erected in Bombay, the city which he had adopted as his home and represented in the legislative assembly. Being located on Chowpatty beach, the premier gathering place of the city, it has become a familiar landmark of modern Bombay.<br>
