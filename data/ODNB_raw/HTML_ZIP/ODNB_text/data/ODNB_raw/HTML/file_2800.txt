<span class="headword">Bolton <span class="st"> [Boulton]</span>,  Edmund Mary</span>  (<em>b. </em>1574/5, <em>d.</em> in or after 1634), <span class="occ">antiquary and historian</span>, was born in 1574 or 1575, according to an impress in his own hand styled &#145;Edmundus Maria Boltonus, aetatis 47, 1622&#146;  (BL, MS Harl. 6521, fol. 152). His parentage is unknown, but he speaks of himself as having descended from the Basset family. Elsewhere he refers to himself as a poor kinsman of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, so it may be speculated that his family originated in the north midlands, perhaps even in Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Like several antiquaries of the early seventeenth century, Bolton was a practising Roman Catholic, having been raised in that religion from birth. He took the name Mary as a middle name, and although he did not suffer persecution until near the end of his life, Bolton's adherence to Rome undoubtedly had a negative effect on his literary career and prosperity. Bolton's early education is unclear, but autobiographical details in his surviving letter-book  (MS Harl. 6521) record that he lived for several years at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, as a free commoner. He is known to have matriculated&#151;presumably disguising his Catholicism&#151;in 1589 (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>; MS Harl. 6521, fol. 247) before moving on, about 1600, to the Inner Temple in London. In one of his earliest works, <span class="italic">The Elements of Armories</span> (1610), a dialogue on the conventions of heraldry, the character of Sir Amias, who may represent the author himself, also refers to university life. It was probably while at Cambridge and then the Inner Temple that he began to make the many acquaintances mentioned in his letter-book, for instance the great antiquary John Selden. Bolton married, about 1606, Margaret Porter, the sister of Endymion Porter, future servant to the duke of Buckingham and Caroline courtier; a letter of 1625 to Secretary Sir Edward Conway refers to Bolton's &#145;wife and family&#146;, but the names of any surviving children are unknown.<br>
<br>Bolton first appears as a public figure near the end of Elizabeth I's reign, when he joined Sir Walter Ralegh and other poets in contributing to the anthology <span class="italic">Englands Helicon</span> (1600). He also penned Latin verses prefixed to Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1600), Thomas Andrewe's <span class="italic">Unmasking of a Feminine Machiavell</span> (1604), and Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> (1605). In addition, Bolton may previously have been the &#145;E. B.&#146; who wrote a sonnet to Lucy, countess of Bedford, printed in Michael Drayton's <span class="italic">Mortimeriados</span> (1596), though this has not been verified.<br>
<br>Bolton's true vocation, however, lay not in verse but in history (especially English and ancient Roman history), and in antiquarian and philological erudition. Although somewhat exaggerated claims for his stature have been made by earlier biographers, he was certainly an important English antiquary of the second rank, well acquainted with William Camden, John Selden, Sir Robert Cotton, Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, and the London historian John Speed. A lifelong friend was the future secretary of state, Sir John Coke. There is no evidence that Bolton was directly connected with the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries that met, off and on, from 1586 to 1614, but his participation in that body cannot be ruled out since he was known to many of its members, and his interests in antiquities, numismatics, genealogy, and heraldry reflect the subjects covered in the society's extant discourses. Bolton's first full-length work to be published, <span class="italic">The Elements of Armories</span>, is among the several works to be produced in late Elizabethan and Jacobean times dealing with heraldry and coats of arms, a subject in which the gentry of the period had a fervent interest; the book appeared in the same year as the better known <span class="italic">Display of Heraldrie</span> by John Guillim.<br>
<br>His various writings, and his largely unsuccessful career, reveal Bolton to have been a man of great ambition but scant financial means, who pressed his causes on his friends and prospective patrons with a persistence that sometimes caused ill will. Among his earliest supporters was the antiquary and manuscript collector Cotton, whose great library was the central meeting-place of antiquaries throughout the first third of the seventeenth century. In 1608 Bolton attempted to secure the patronage of Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, for a &#145;litle Latin work&#146;, without success. Through Cotton, he then approached the earl of Northampton, who as a Catholic may have been more sympathetic; even Northampton, however, soon grew weary of Bolton's apparently endless requests for assistance and told him henceforth to contact him only indirectly, through Cotton. It must have been a severe disappointment to Bolton when, in 1614, Northampton died and left him nothing.<br>
<br>It must also be said, however, that Bolton was equally indefatigable in promoting the interests of less fortunate friends and relatives, without reference to creed. In 1610 he asked Northampton, through Cotton, to provide an impoverished cousin with some appointment, in lieu of such a reward to Bolton himself who, as a Catholic, was unable to hold public office. In 1617 he again sought help for the same cousin, this time at the hands of Edward Alleyn, the famous actor.<br>
<br>About the same time that Bolton published his <span class="italic">Elements</span>, Cotton found him employment as a kind of research assistant to the tailor turned historian John Speed, himself a client of Fulke Greville. Speed was at this point compiling materials for his <span class="italic">History of Great Britaine</span> (1611) and the accompanying volume of maps, <span class="italic">The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine</span>. Although Speed wrote most of this himself, he made extensive use of the researches of others. Bolton provided the life of Henry II, but on review it was found to be too favourable to Thomas Becket, and Bolton's work was replaced by a piece by John Barcham or Barkham, prebendary of St Paul's. It was probably about this time that Bolton conceived one of his lifelong ambitions, the writing of a new, scholarly history of England that went beyond both the Elizabethan chroniclers, such as John Stow, and Speed's own patchwork history.<br>
<br>Bolton set off on his own plans again in 1617, when he approached the rising favourite, Buckingham, to enlist his support in the establishment of an &#145;academ roial&#146;. Unlike France, England had no official learned or literary body, outside the universities, and several schemes were afoot to remedy that in the early seventeenth century. Bolton's went beyond the usual goal of setting up a finishing school for gentry and nobility; his academy was to be dedicated to the study of history, antiquities, heraldry, and literature in general. More than simply a revived Society of Antiquaries, however, this was to be an elaborate, tripartite structure chartered and endowed by the crown with &pound;200 per annum. Its members were to be tutelaries (knights of the Garter, the lord chancellor, and the two university chancellors); auxiliaries (select members of the aristocracy); and essentials, the heart of the body, leading gentlemen of prominent families, of independent means, and of scholarly interests. Upon the academ were to fall great privileges and the role of cultural police, licensing non-theological books and reviewing translations of learned works. The names that Bolton selected for the original membership of eighty-four included some of the leading poets and scholars of the period&#151;his friends prominent among them&#151;including John Selden, Sir Henry Spelman, Sir Kenelm Digby, Sir Edward Coke, Endymion Porter, Sir Henry Wotton, Sir Robert Cotton, Ben Jonson, and Michael Drayton. Various versions of Bolton's proposal survive, and the scheme continued to enjoy Buckingham's support until 1624, but appears to have died with James I in the following year.<br>
<br>Bolton was at the same time developing the groundwork for the writing of a new history of England, and as a prolegomenon to this he authored one of his best-known works, an essay entitled <span class="italic">Hypercritica, or, A Rule of Judgement, for Writing or Reading our Histories</span>. Although this has often been dated as early as 1610, he began it no earlier than 1618, and it is referred to in a translation of the Roman historian Lucius Florus that Bolton published the following year, when William Camden also saw it. It cannot have been finished before 1621, since it refers to Francis Bacon by the title of Viscount St Albans. Unpublished in his lifetime, the <span class="italic">Hypercritica</span>, in contrast to other <i>artes historicae</i> (&#145;arts of history&#146;) of the period, stressed the writing rather than the reading of history. In particular, it emphasized the need to found any new history of England on rolls, manuscripts, and other materials to be found in the Tower and other archives as well as the more traditional chronicle sources. Although he was not nearly as dismissive of medieval chroniclers as his older contemporary Sir Henry Savile, Bolton was also among the principal exponents of the view that the chronicle was an outdated genre; he distinguished, however, between the value that medieval chroniclers retained as sources and the unsatisfactory character of Elizabethan historians (such as Raphael Holinshed or Richard Grafton) and their &#145;vast vulgar tomes&#146;. Like his contemporary Francis Bacon, and many French writers, he believed that proper scholarship would produce a perfect history of the kingdom that would eventually need no further revision, a definitive <span class="italic">Corpus rerum Anglicarum</span>. The manuscripts to the <span class="italic">Hypercritica</span> also shed light on Bolton's flexibility: an early version refers to a work by Fulke Greville, <span class="italic">Mustapha</span>, as &#145;impious&#146;; by 1621, when he may have been in receipt of some assistance from Greville, he had changed that word to &#145;matchless&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood F.9, fols. 37, 29; MS Rawl., D.1, fol. 15).<br>
<br>Roman history was another of Bolton's preoccupations, and he did his most original work in this field, admiring Polybius above all other ancient authors. In addition to the above-mentioned translation of Florus, and a work, which has not survived except in notes, on the reign of Tiberius, Bolton made a special study of the sources for the reign of Nero Caesar, and this became the subject of a full-length history, <span class="italic">Nero Caesar, or, Monarchie Depraved</span>, first published in 1624. This may have been produced in haste, since at many points blank spots appear where images of coins were intended to be placed, a fault remedied in the second edition of 1627. <span class="italic">Nero Caesar</span> appears on the one hand to be a shamelessly sycophantic plea for patronage from Buckingham and Charles I, stressing the virtues of strong rule. Bolton's purpose, however, was not to apologize for Nero's reign but to compare its severity with the benefits of Stuart government, and to argue that even the most despotic rule must not be resisted by rebellion; the consequences of Nero's deposition, monster though he may have been, were endless successive rebellions and depositions throughout the remainder of Roman imperial history. The language of the preface suggests that the work was encouraged by James I himself, perhaps through Buckingham, and Bolton may have intended it as a working out of some of the king's own ideas on monarchy. The real originality of <span class="italic">Nero Caesar</span>, however, lies less in what it says than in its use of sources. Unlike many contemporaries, Bolton adduced non-literary evidence such as coins and inscriptions (published in collections by Camden and by European scholars such as Janus Gruter and Jacopo de Strada) in proof of his assertions and as a corrective to the accounts of the ancients themselves. It is thus one of the earliest English attempts to synthesize humanist narrative history with advanced philological and antiquarian scholarship.<br>
<br>Bolton's livelihood was never secure&#151;he complained, as many authors, of the rapacious character of booksellers and did not grow wealthy from his publications. The last of these was <span class="italic">The Citties Advocate</span> (1629), an enquiry into the question of whether commercial activity, and especially apprenticeship, extinguished gentility. This turn of interest reflects the close connection with the London city &eacute;lite that Bolton developed in his last years, a shift away from the intellectual aristocracy he had cultivated in the years of the &#145;academ roial&#146; scheme. In part this turn to a municipal patron arose from necessity. By 1628 Buckingham had abandoned Bolton&#151;as early as 1623 the duke had failed to appoint his impecunious client to an unnamed educational post, perhaps the vacant provostship of Eton College.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the new king, Charles I, had embarked upon a more vigorous persecution of Catholics than his father. In 1628 Bolton was fined as a recusant and, being unable to pay, confined to Fleet prison, whence he was moved to the Marshalsea, probably within a year or so. Requests to friends and relatives for assistance produced little: Endymion Porter tore his brother-in-law's letter up in disgust. As a means of reducing his debts, he proposed to the London aldermen that he undertake a complete chronological history of London, with maps, entitled the <span class="italic">Vindiciae Britannicae</span>. This was to be published in Latin and English, and was intended to improve on John Stow's 1598 <span class="italic">Survay of London</span>, which Bolton thought reliable but badly written. Several months of work on the project and some encouragement from the city led to profound disappointment when the aldermen, faced with his estimate of &pound;3000 to &pound;4000 pounds as the cost of publishing the book, backed out of the project and refused to reimburse him for expenses incurred. In an early example of an appeal to academic referees, Bolton suggested that his manuscript be sent out to learned readers such as Ben Jonson, John Selden, Sir Henry Wotton, Kenelm Digby, Sir Edward Coke, Sir Dudley Digges, and Degory Whear, the Camden professor of ancient history at Oxford (and fellow student of both Lucius Florus and the <i>ars historica</i>). There is no evidence that this occurred, but in 1632 Bolton gave the manuscript of the <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span>, which has not survived, to Selden, his long-time neighbour in Whitefriars, for delivery to the aldermen. Unknown to Bolton, the city had already contracted with the better known Jonson to provide a more modest chronology at no charge. In 1634 Bolton contacted his old friend Sir John Coke, sending him the unpublished life of Tiberius that he had written as a companion to <span class="italic">Nero</span>. Since this is his last known letter, it may be presumed that Bolton died at Marshalsea soon thereafter.<br>
