<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dukes, Sir  Paul</span>  (1889&#150;1967), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and author</span>, was born on 10 February 1889 at North Field, Bridgwater, the son of Edwin Joshua Dukes, a Congregational minister, and his wife, Edith Mary Pope. Dukes was educated at Caterham School before travelling to St Petersburg to study music, and he was to write in his memoirs that &#145;I felt at home from the moment of arrival in the city&#146;  (Dukes, <span class="italic">The Story of &#145;ST 25&#146;</span>, 14). He worked at the Marinsky Theatre with the conductor Albert Coates, and was convinced for a time that he was destined to pursue a musical career. The outbreak of war upset his plans, though, and at the start of 1916 Dukes joined the Anglo-Russian commission established the previous year. For the next two years he was involved in promoting the somewhat nebulous range of propaganda activities carried out by the commission, serving both in the Russian capital and at the Foreign Office in London.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1918 Dukes was summoned back to Britain where he was recruited into the Secret Intelligence Service. Allied military intervention in post-revolutionary Russia was already under way, and the British authorities were keen to place an agent in the country before it was sealed off from the outside world. At the end of 1918 Dukes (using the codename ST 25) crossed the Finnish border and travelled to Petrograd, equipped with the false papers he needed to carry out his work. Dukes already spoke fluent Russian and boasted a formidable range of contacts in the Russian capital. During his time in Russia he passed himself off as a member of the secret police (the <i>Cheka</i>), and later enlisted in the Red Army. He also joined the Bolshevik Party and developed links with at least one individual who had good access to some of its leading figures. Dukes showed himself to be a master of disguises during his time in Russia, frequently changing his appearance and using more than a dozen names to conceal his identity. He recounted some of his extraordinary adventures in his books <span class="italic">Red Dusk and the Morrow</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">The Story of &#145;ST 25&#146;</span> (1938), which remain among the most gripping examples of real-life espionage literature.<br>
<br>Dukes was deliberately vague when describing his activities in Russia, implying in his memoirs that he spent his time collecting information about a wide range of social and political developments. The most valuable material he obtained was in fact concerned with the operational effectiveness and morale of Bolshevik naval forces in the eastern Baltic, a subject of vital concern to British military planners during the time of allied intervention. Many of Dukes's reports were smuggled out of Russia by couriers transported on the boats of a special naval unit headed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40848/', "Captain Augustus Agar")</script>, who later won the Victoria Cross for his activities. A mission by Agar's unit to extract Dukes himself failed, however, with the result that ST 25 was forced to make his own escape across the Latvian border.<br>
<br>Dukes and Agar met in person only after they had returned to London. George V was deeply impressed by the bravery and daring of the two men, and awarded Dukes a KBE in 1920 since he was not, as a civilian, eligible to receive the Victoria Cross. Despite the success of his activities in Russia the Secret Intelligence Service appeared unwilling to make further use of Dukes between the wars. This may have been a consequence of the cuts in the organization's budget that followed the end of the First World War, though it probably also reflected unease among its senior members about Dukes's somewhat eccentric interest in various forms of eastern mysticism. About 1922 he joined a tantric community at Nyack, 15 miles from New York, led by Dr Pierre Arnold Bernard (known as the &#145;Omnipotent Oom&#146;). While living there Dukes married Margaret Rutherford, but the couple were divorced in 1929. He married Diana Fitzgerald in 1959.<br>
<br>Dukes engaged in a good deal of journalistic work after returning to Britain from Russia, serving as a special correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, as well as lecturing widely in the United States and Canada. He was chairman of British Continental Press from 1930 to 1937. On the eve of the Second World War he was asked by some acquaintances to visit Germany in order to trace the whereabouts of a wealthy Czech businessman who had fled from house arrest following his imprisonment by the Nazis. He described his adventures in <span class="italic">An Epic of the Gestapo</span> (1940), in which he argued that there were clear parallels between soviet communism and German Nazism, but the book lacked the drama of his earlier works. In the Second World War, Dukes lectured on behalf of the Ministry of Information, and served as a director of companies involved in aircraft production. In later years he developed his interest in yoga, writing a number of books on the subject, including <span class="italic">Yoga for the Western World</span> (1955), and <span class="italic">The Yoga of Health, Youth and Joy</span> (1960), as well as making a series of broadcasts for the BBC.<br>
<br>Paul Dukes possessed many of the qualities that helped to forge the reputation of members of the Secret Intelligence Service in the public mind. His arrival in Russia on secret service took place soon after several other British agents, including Sidney Reilly, had been forced to flee the country following their involvement in an abortive plot to destroy the youthful Bolshevik regime. Dukes's role in Russia during 1919 was essentially the more modest one of observer and reporter, but he played his part with a high degree of courage and intelligence.<br>
<br>Sir Paul Dukes died in Cape Town, South Africa, on 27 August 1967.<br>
