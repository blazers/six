<span class="headword">Rogers,  Frederick</span>  (1846&#150;1915), <span class="occ">bookbinder and trade unionist</span>, was born on 27 April 1846 in Gower's Walk, Whitechapel, London, the eldest in the family of four sons (one of whom died in infancy) and two daughters of Frederick Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1908), sailor, draper's assistant, labourer, and painter, and his wife, Susan Barltrop (<i>d</i>. 1907). Rogers left school at ten or earlier and became an errand-boy. He was plagued by ill health in his youth but recovered to enter the vellum bookbinding trade, with which he was associated in a variety of capacities for nearly forty years.<br>
<br>Outside his work, Rogers's principal interests lay in education, religion, and trade unionism. He was an outstanding example of a working-class autodidact, and, with Alfred Milner, was co-secretary of the university extension movement in east London from 1877. An Oxford lecture which he delivered in 1883 influenced the subsequent founding of Toynbee Hall, the east London settlement in whose affairs Rogers was long active. He contributed to many newspapers and magazines, among them the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>, in whose pages he was in 1885&#150;6 an early advocate of the formation of an Independent Labour Party.<br>
<br>Originally a nonconformist, Rogers was later converted to Anglo-Catholicism by the ritualist curate Arthur Henry Stanton. His religious beliefs marked him deeply and inspired a number of publications, including two short books entitled <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Sins</span> (1907) and <span class="italic">The Church in the Modern State</span> (1914).<br>
<br>After helping to lead an unsuccessful strike by the Vellum Binders' Society in 1891&#150;2 for the eight-hour day, Rogers became the union's president. He failed in three attempts to secure election to the Trades Union Congress's parliamentary committee, but he represented the vellum binders at the foundation conference of the Labour Representation Committee in February 1900, and was elected to its executive. He served for three years, originally as chairman, and it was as the first chairman of what was to become the Labour Party that he achieved his principal prominence in Labour history. In later years he drifted away from his original Liberalism and his later Labour ties, and in 1910&#150;11 served as a Conservative nominee as alderman on the London county council.<br>
<br>Rogers's principal political achievement was his work as secretary of the National Committee of Organised Labour, a body established in 1899 to work for universal old-age pensions. It was a lengthy and difficult task, marked by the indifference and even antagonism of the movement in whose name he nominally acted, but his speaking, organizing, and writing skills (he produced fifteen pamphlets and a co-authored book), and tireless travelling until victory was achieved in 1908, made him the &#145;ideal secretary&#146; described by F. H. Stead, the warden of the Browning Hall settlement and his collaborator in the pension struggle. It is notable that despite Rogers's high Anglicanism he worked harmoniously with the Congregationalist Stead and was actively involved with the interdenominational Browning Hall.<br>
<br>Rogers's most important literary work was his autobiography, <span class="italic">Labour, Life and Literature</span> (1913). Towards the end of his life he was an enthusiastic supporter of British involvement in the First World War, for which he made recruiting speeches.<br>
<br>Rogers was somewhat reserved and shy in private life and an obituary notice by his old acquaintance, Canon Henry Scott Holland, described him as suggesting &#145;something strange and blurred&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commonwealth</span>, December 1915). Holland, Stead, and others wrote warmly of him, but in a wider circle he was more respected than loved. His educational achievements, lack of a major trade union base, and personal idiosyncrasies inhibited his effectiveness as a labour leader, but did not prevent him from making significant contributions to his class and time. He died on 16 November 1915 at his home, 29 Bousfield Road, New Cross, London, to which he had moved from Whitechapel in 1901, and he was buried in Nunhead cemetery. He was unmarried.<br>
