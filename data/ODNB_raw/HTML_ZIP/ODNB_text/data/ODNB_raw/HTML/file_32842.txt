<span class="headword">Dobbs, Sir  Henry Robert Conway</span>  (1871&#150;1934), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in London on 26 August 1871, the second son of Robert Conway Dobbs (1842&#150;1915) of Camphire House, Cappoquin, co. Waterford, Ireland, and his wife, Edith Juliana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broadwood (<i>d</i>. 1932). He was a scholar of Winchester College and of Brasenose College, Oxford, although he left Oxford after two years without taking a degree. He entered the Indian Civil Service in 1892, and was transferred to the political department in 1899. His first &#145;political&#146; post was in the state of Mysore, but it was not long before he found his way to the north-west frontier, an area with which much of his later career was to be associated. On 4 March 1907 he married Esm&eacute; Agnes, eldest daughter of George Wilmot Rivaz of Canterbury, formerly of the Indian Civil Service; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Dobbs carried out some adventurous journeys in his earlier years in the political department. In 1902&#150;3 he travelled across Persia from Baghdad to Sistan; in 1904 he explored the then little-known tract of Hazarajat between Herat and Kabul. In 1904&#150;5 he was attached as secretary to Sir Louis Dane's mission to Kabul, whose outcome was the treaty with Britain by which the Amir Habibullah renewed the engagements entered into by his father, Amir &#145;Abd al-Rahman, in 1880. Since it stipulated that the amir should hold &#145;relations with no foreign power except the British government&#146;, the treaty aroused some criticism at the time. However, it stood the test of the First World War, during which Habibullah remained neutral.<br>
<br>Between 1907 and 1914 Dobbs served in Baluchistan under Sir Arthur McMahon, and was particularly influenced by the &#145;Sandeman system&#146;, a method of administration devised for tribal areas by Sir Robert Sandeman, governor of Kaharistan in the latter part of the nineteenth century. This gave official governmental recognition to tribal chiefs and tribal law, and set up the chiefs, under the overlordship of the raj, to police their own districts. As revenue commissioner in the civil administration formed in the wake of Indian expeditionary force D's invasion of Mesopotamia, where he served between January 1915 and October 1916, Dobbs translated these principles into the tribal criminal and civil disputes regulation (February 1916), and collected information on revenue and land tenure that was to form the basis of the taxation system of the future state of Iraq.<br>
<br>Dobbs returned to India at the end of 1916 and served successively as revenue and judicial commissioner (April 1917) and chief commissioner (December 1917) in Baluchistan, and subsequently (1919) as foreign secretary to the government of India. In 1920&#150;21 Dobbs headed a mission to Kabul where&#151;in very difficult circumstances&#151;he negotiated a revision of the treaty of 1905 with Amir Habibullah's successor, Amir Amanullah. At this stage the Soviet government was eagerly courting the Afghans, largely in order to consolidate and expand its influence in central Asia. Eventually Amanullah signed treaties with both the Soviet Union and Britain in 1921. The Anglo-Afghan treaty marked something of a rapprochement with Britain, setting up full diplomatic relations between the two states. In his report on his mission to Kabul, Dobbs's description of his difficulties with Amanullah and of the latter's highly mercurial character shows its author's talent for shrewd judgement and nuanced observation.<br>
<br>In February 1923 Dobbs succeeded Sir Percy Cox as high commissioner for Iraq. It was not an easy post to fill; at the time of Dobbs's arrival no agreement had been reached at Lausanne on the frontier between Iraq and Turkey, and calls were still being made in the British press for Britain to evacuate Iraq. Eventually negotiations for the Anglo-Iraqi treaty were completed in 1924, although Dobbs had gambled heavily by deporting a number of anti-treaty Shi&#145;i religious leaders to Persia in 1923, and had also crossed swords with King Faisal I. After 1924, and particularly after the settlement of the Mosul boundary question in Iraq's favour, Dobbs encouraged the Colonial Office in London not to &#145;make it appear to the Iraqi public that H. B. M.'s Government is desirous of binding them hand and foot&#146;, on the grounds that Britain would ultimately find it easier and cheaper to administer the mandate for Iraq if it did not make excessive and unpopular demands, a policy which was eventually adopted.<br>
<br>During the six years Dobbs was high commissioner the political horizon was seldom clear for many weeks in succession. The election of the constituent assembly, and subsequently of the Iraqi parliament; the ratification of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty in 1924; the control of the Kurdish districts, and the difficulty of persuading the Kurdish tribal leaders to accept the political framework of the Iraqi state; the Mosul frontier question; the financial viability of the new state; these and other issues demanded constant attention. By the end of Dobbs's time in Iraq it was clear that Britain's goal of maintaining strong indirect control over the country had been achieved enough to make Iraq's entry to the League of Nations only a matter of time. As a diplomat and administrator Dobbs played a crucial role in securing this objective.<br>
<br>Dobbs was appointed CIE in 1905, CSI in 1916, KCIE and KCSI in 1921, KCMG in 1925, and GBE on his retirement from Iraq in 1929. The last years of his life were spent at his family home at Cappoquin, where he died after a long illness on 30 May 1934.<br>
