<span class="headword">Clement <span class="st"> [Clemmet]</span>,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1779, <em>d.</em> 1844), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was baptized on 13 June 1779 at Great Asby, Westmorland, one of several children of Thomas Clemmet, a hand-loom weaver, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elliotson. The village school taught him only to read and write, but he learned from his father, who had a taste for natural history and mechanics and had built himself a lathe. Joseph first worked alongside his father as a weaver, then as a slater, and devoted his spare time to metalworking skill, taking lessons from the local blacksmith and building his own lathe. On this he turned various woodwind instruments, which he also learned to play.<br>
<br>By 1805 Clement (it is not known when he adopted this form of his name) had decided to earn his living by engineering, and was making looms at a factory in Kirkby Stephen, moving to Foster &amp; Sons, Carlisle, then in 1807 to Glasgow where he took drawing lessons from Peter Nicholson and became a competent draughtsman. Later he was with Leys, Masson &amp; Co. of Aberdeen, where in 1812&#150;13 he found time to attend lectures in natural philosophy given by Professor Copland at Marischal College.<br>
<br>Having saved &pound;100, Clement moved in 1813 to London, then the world's foremost centre for engineering. His rare combination of mechanical and drawing skills enabled him to progress rapidly to the top; from a humble beginning with Galloway at Holborn, he soon rose to be works manager for Joseph Bramah at Pimlico and by 1815 he was chief draughtsman at the leading firm of Maudslay, Son, and Field. His experience at these two renowned firms was to prove invaluable. In 1817 Clement set up his own business, specializing in technical drawing and the manufacture of high-precision machinery, working from premises behind his house at 21 Prospect Place, Southwark. Turnover was modest until in 1823 Charles Babbage employed Clement on his project to design and construct the complex &#145;difference engine&#146;, a large mechanical calculating device. Clement was required to build large, highly accurate machine tools, the best-known of which was his planing machine, built in 1831. According to general practice, the cost of building workshop tools was chargeable to the project but they were considered to be the property of their maker. Clement's machinery was, however, so much larger and more costly than the tools usually considered under this head that he fell out with Babbage on this score, and they eventually parted company. These tools brought him a good income for many years for customers were attracted by his skill and the quality of his products, despite his justifiable reputation for charging remarkably high prices.<br>
<br>Clement was an outstanding toolmaker and draughtsman. He introduced both headless and fluted screw-cutting taps and was one of those urging the adoption of a standard system of screw threads. His works was regarded as one of the best schools for practical mechanics; and perhaps the most distinguished engineer to be employed there was Joseph Whitworth. From 1815 Clement provided technical drawings for the publications of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, and he was awarded three medals by the society for his various tools and inventions.<br>
<br>Clement never lost his Westmorland accent and was described by the engineering historian Samuel Smiles as &#145;a heavy-browed man without any polish of manner of speech&#146; whose head was &#145;a complete repertory of inventions&#146; and who liked nothing better than a &#145;tough job&#146;  (Smiles, 245, 257).<br>
<br>In his later years Clement returned to his old love of music and constructed an organ, which Smiles reported as sounding very well. He died unmarried at 31 St George's Road, Southwark on 28 February 1844. The major bequest in his will was the legacy of Bank of England stock valued at &pound;4000 to his natural daughter Sarah Clement, daughter of Agnes Esson of Tanfield, Durham. Sarah was also to receive his gold watch and two of the medals awarded him by the Society of Arts. Other bequests went to the offspring of his four brothers and sisters, while his machine tools and the contents of his workshop, which he valued at &pound;4000, were to be offered to his nephew Joseph, son of his sister, Barbara Wilkinson, at that price. Joseph Wilkinson did take up this offer, and he continued Clement's business, but only for a short time.<br>
