<span class="headword">Grubb,  Thomas</span>  (1800&#150;1878), <span class="occ">engineer and telescope builder</span>, was born on 4 August 1800 at Waterford, son of William Grubb, draper, of Capel Street, Dublin, and his second wife, Eleanor Fayle, both members of the Society of Friends. Thomas was the great-great-grandson of Ishmael Grubb who had emigrated to Ireland from Northamptonshire in 1656. He disowned the Society of Friends on his marriage to Sarah Purser on 12 September 1826. They had nine children.<br>
<br>The nature of Grubb's education and training is unknown, but by about 1830 he was in business in Dublin as a mechanical engineer. His first telescopes were modest instruments for his own use. He soon made contact with the then substantial Irish astronomical community, and in particular with the Revd Thomas Romney Robinson (1793&#150;1882), director of Armagh observatory. Robinson appreciated his skill and inventiveness, and had a knowledge of optics which complemented Grubb's understanding of the mechanical problems of mounting large telescopes. Through Robinson, Grubb was asked to mount a 13.3 inch lens by Cauchoix of Paris for E. J. Cooper of Markree, co. Sligo. As a preparation for working on this instrument he made a full-scale model which was transformed into a 15 inch reflector for the Armagh observatory. The metal mirror of this telescope was supported by a system of triangular levers designed by Grubb, which greatly reduced the flexure of the mirror under its own weight. This system was used by the third earl of Rosse in mounting the mirror of his 6 foot telescope at Parsonstown, King's county, which he completed in 1845. Grubb also made various minor optical components for him.<br>
<br>Grubb's mastery of mounting large telescopes led to other commissions, including the &#145;Sheepshanks telescope&#146; for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (1838), a 22 inch reflecting telescope for the University of Glasgow (1853), and a 12 inch refractor for Trinity College's observatory at Dunsink, co. Dublin, in 1868. Grubb did not make the object glasses or primary mirrors for these instruments.<br>
<br>Grubb's business was not confined to astronomy. He carried out a variety of scientific work for Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1839 made about twenty sets of magnetometers for Professor Humphrey Lloyd, who was establishing a network of magnetic observatories in the British colonies: Lloyd preferred to have them made in Dublin rather than London so that he could oversee the work. From 1840 until his death Grubb was engineer to the Bank of Ireland, responsible for designing and constructing machines for engraving, printing, and numbering banknotes.<br>
<br>The success of Rosse's 6 foot telescope in revealing that some nebulae had a spiral structure, and in greatly increasing the number of nebulae known, prompted Robinson to argue that a comparable telescope built by Grubb should be sent to the southern hemisphere to review the southern skies. Robinson's requests for funding were rejected by the government in 1850 and 1853, but in 1862 the colony of Victoria offered to pay for an instrument. After indecision and disagreement about the nature of the most suitable telescope, Grubb signed a contract in 1866 for the construction of a Cassegrain reflector with two interchangeable 4 foot metal mirrors. It was made in 1866&#150;7 in specially built premises in Rathmines, on the south side of Dublin, and installed at Melbourne in 1869. Hailed before its erection as a technical triumph, it was such an expensive and embarrassing failure that its defects were never analysed dispassionately, but the principal one was probably the inability of the astronomers in Melbourne to repolish the mirrors in the way that the earl of Rosse had regularly reworked his at Parsonstown. The choice of metal at a time when silvered glass mirrors were being made in increasingly good quality was unfortunate. Thomas Grubb was elected FRS in 1864 and died at his house, 141 Leinster Road, Rathmines, on 19 September 1878. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50600"></a><span class="headword">Sir Howard Grubb</span>  (1844&#150;1931), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was the fifth and youngest son of Thomas Grubb. He was born in Dublin and read civil engineering at Trinity College, Dublin. He joined his father in business in 1865 and took control of the firm in 1868: he remained in charge for fifty-seven years. He made most of the large telescopes required by Britain and the colonies during his lifetime, including five instruments for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in 1890&#150;97; on one of these, a 30 inch Cassegrain reflector, P. J. Melotte discovered the eighth satellite of Jupiter in 1908. Grubb also had significant sales elsewhere, from the 27 inch refractor for the University of Vienna in 1881, which was for a short time the largest refractor in the world, to the 40 inch reflector for Simeiz observatory in the Crimea, which was delivered after he retired. The majority of his largest instruments were refractors. Around 1890 he delivered seven of the thirteen photographic instruments for the worldwide <i>Carte du ciel</i> project. It was with one of these telescopes, at a solar eclipse in 1919, that Sir Arthur Eddington provided the first experimental verification of Einstein's theory of relativity by showing that the apparent position of a star was altered when its light passed close to the sun. Grubb also made smaller telescopes but did not sell them under his own name.<br>
<br>In the second half of the nineteenth century astronomical research required larger telescopes which could be used to photograph increasingly faint objects: these instruments required very steady mountings and smooth driving mechanisms. From the 1860s spectroscopy developed rapidly; the spectroscope was at the centre of the new science of astrophysics, and Howard Grubb was a leader in the improvement of instruments to meet these demands. In 1870 he built a 15 inch refractor which was bought by the Royal Society and used by William and Mary Huggins in their pioneering work on photographing stellar spectra. Grubb was more of a scientist than his father and was able to master a succession of technical challenges, though in the optical design of some of his largest instruments he was aided by another Irishman, Sir George Gabriel Stokes, Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge. Sir David Gill, after his retirement from his post in South Africa, gave Grubb advice on designing his largest telescopes. In 1871 Grubb married Mary Hester Walker (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of a physician from Louisiana: they had four sons and three daughters. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1883, and was knighted in 1887.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the twentieth century Grubb became interested in the military use of optical instruments, and designed rangefinders and gunsights. He constructed the first submarine periscope. During the First World War his firm became heavily involved in the war effort, and because of unrest in Ireland it was moved by the government to St Albans in 1916&#150;18. Grubb sold the firm to Sir Charles Algernon Parsons in 1925, when it was transferred to Tyneside. Grubb retired to Ireland. He died at 13 Longford Terrace, Monkstown, co. Dublin, on 16 September 1931.<br>
