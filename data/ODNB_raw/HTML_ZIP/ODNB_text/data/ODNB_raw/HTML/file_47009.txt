<span class="headword">Fraser,  (William) Lionel</span>  (1895&#150;1965), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 15 June 1895 in London, the second of the four children of Harry Fraser and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnard (<i>d</i>. 1949). His father, a Scot, was butler to Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges department store.<br>
<br>Fraser's schooling began and ended at St Mary Abbots higher grade church school, Kensington, although he periodically attended other schools as his parents moved around the country. Thanks to a scholarship, he enrolled, at the age of thirteen, at Pitman's School where he received an intensive commercial training, studying French, German, Spanish, shorthand, typing, and accounts.<br>
<br>Fraser's working life began in June 1911, aged sixteen, when he joined Bonn &amp; Co., a small bank that specialized in foreign exchange transactions. He handled correspondence and bookkeeping at a salary of &pound;70. A member of a territorial regiment, he was mobilized on the outbreak of war and commissioned in 1915, before being invalided out because of a knee injury sustained during a game of football. For the rest of the hostilities, he worked in naval intelligence.<br>
<br>The early 1920s saw turbulent conditions in the foreign exchange market, providing lucrative opportunities for astute operators. In 1921, following the acquisition of Bonn &amp; Co. by Helbert, Wagg &amp; Co., he was made head of Helbert, Wagg's foreign exchange department. With George Bolton, later a leading figure at the Bank of England and elsewhere in the City of London, as his second in command, Fraser established Helbert, Wagg as a leading participant in the London foreign exchange market, much enhancing the firm's standing. In the mid-1920s, he switched to UK equities, both trading and underwriting, and soon developed a formidable reputation as a corporate financier. He was made a director of Helbert, Wagg in 1934. In 1931, aged thirty-six, he married Cynthia Elizabeth Walter and they had two sons and a daughter. A devoted family man, he lived at home looking after his mother until his marriage.<br>
<br>In the Second World War, sponsored by Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, whose personal investments he managed, Fraser worked at the Treasury, his responsibilities including liaison with the governments-in-exile of occupied countries. He was created CMG in 1945 for his services. These connections led to his appointment as the Bank of England's representative to the State Bank of Morocco.<br>
<br>Returning to Helbert, Wagg after the war, Fraser was appointed deputy chairman in 1946. The same year, he also became chairman of the newly formed Issuing Houses Association. In 1954, he was made chairman of Helbert, Wagg. A highly regarded figure in the City, his reputation sprang from his expertise in the provision of advice about corporate finance. He played an influential role in a number of take-overs. For instance, he was called upon to act as an impartial mediator in the negotiations that followed Sears's controversial hostile take-over bid for Watneys in 1959.<br>
<br>Fraser received many invitations to sit on outside boards. His directorships included the engineering firm Tube Investments, Royal Exchange Assurance, and also Spicers, the paper makers. In 1950 he became chairman of boiler-makers Babcock and Wilcox, a Helbert, Wagg client. He devoted up to a third of his working time to the Babcock chairmanship, which he held until 1960.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Fraser also served as chairman of Thomas Tilling, of which he had been a director since 1942. This appointment stemmed from the untimely demise of his predecessor, Frederick Heaton, in May 1949. Just before his death, Heaton had negotiated the sale of Tillings's bus and garage interests, its major business, to the government body charged with the nationalization of British transport. It fell to Fraser to deploy these resources to develop Tillings into a new entity, a diversified industrial holding company, then a relatively novel concept in the UK. By 1962, when he stepped down, the activities of Tillings's thirty or so main subsidiaries were indeed diversified, comprising building supplies, electrical wholesaling, engineering, glassware manufacture, textiles, insurance, vehicle distribution, and publishing. A small and specialized head office staff provided guidance and supervision, especially in relation to finance and strategy. But hands-on management was decentralized, being conducted at subsidiary level. This textbook conglomerate structure proved successful, Tillings's business expanding rapidly and profitably.<br>
<br>Although not the originator of the proposal for a merger between Helbert, Wagg and Schroders, Fraser actively pursued the idea. There is no doubt that he expected to become deputy chairman of the new entity and was disappointed when Gordon Richardson was appointed in May 1962. He resigned a few months later, having been recruited to set up the London subsidiary of the French merchant bank Paribas.<br>
<br>At a height of 6 feet 4 inches, Fraser never went unnoticed. The newspaper publisher Hugh Cudlip described him in a thumbnail sketch as a tall, straightforward, handsome, commanding figure. He had a forceful and energetic personality and a strong will to win, sometimes earning him enemies. But among his friends, including his obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he was cherished for a &#145;warm heart, a gift for friendship, and a gay attitude to life &hellip; He was an ardent Christian Scientist and his deep religious convictions added a fundamental integrity and seriousness of character. All these things made him an inspiring leader&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Jan 1965).<br>
<br>Business absorbed most of Fraser's time and energy, although in 1945&#150;50 he served as a Conservative member of Chelsea borough council and toyed with the idea of standing for parliament. He and his wife were keen collectors of abstract art, and Fraser served as a trustee of the Tate Gallery. He enjoyed club life, being a member of six clubs, including the Garrick, the Travellers', and White's. Lionel Fraser died of bronchial pneumonia and cancer on 2 January 1965 at his residence, 30 Charles Street, Westminster, London, aged sixty-nine.<br>
