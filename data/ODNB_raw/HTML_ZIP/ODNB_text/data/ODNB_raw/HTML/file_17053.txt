<span class="headword">Lovelace,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1621&#150;1675), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was the fourth of eight children of Sir William Lovelace (<i>bap</i>. 1584, <i>d</i>. 1627), politician and army officer, of Bethersden and Woolwich, Kent, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1633), daughter of Sir William Barne and his wife, Anne Sandys. Lovelace was a zealous supporter of Charles I in the English civil war, serving as a colonel in the royalist forces. In June 1644 he was appointed governor of Carmarthen Castle in Wales. He lost the castle to parliamentary forces in October 1645, after a sharp fight in which his brother William was killed. Another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17056/', "Richard Lovelace")</script>, the cavalier poet, memorialized these events in <span class="italic">Lucasta</span>. For a time he served on the continent with his brothers Richard and Dudley in the forces of Louis XIV, then in 1650 joined his sister Anne Gorsuch in Virginia. When the colony was seized by parliamentary commissioners in 1652, Governor Sir William Berkeley dispatched him to France to inform Charles II. In 1658 he returned to England to aid the royalist cause. About a year later he secretly married Blanche Talbot. They had two children. On 5 August 1659 he was arrested and thrown into the Tower of London, but was freed in 1660 when Charles II ascended the throne.<br>
<br>In the years following the Restoration, Lovelace apparently lived in London and worked for the Admiralty. He appears to have been appointed deputy governor of Long Island in 1665 but it is unclear if he took up the post. In 1667 he succeeded Richard Nicolls as governor of New York. Samuel Maverick, a New Englander in high standing with the royalists, had recommended Lovelace to the earl of Clarendon, lord high chancellor, as a person eminently qualified for the office. A contemporary newsletter announcing the appointment mistakenly identified him as the brother of Lord Lovelace, which has led to him being confused with his near contemporary Francis Lovelace, son of Richard, first Baron Lovelace of Hurley, who died in 1673. On 13 June 1667 Lovelace was commissioned lieutenant-colonel in Sir Walter Vane's regiment. He arrived in New York in March 1668, and spent the summer receiving instruction from Nicolls in his new duties. In August he assumed full powers, attempting to maintain English authority over the diverse Dutch, Swedish, and English populations while keeping frictions to a minimum. Unlike Nicolls, he held regular council meetings, but usually did not follow the councillors' advice. Recognizing the religious diversity among New Yorkers, he guaranteed them liberty of conscience, &#145;provided they raise not fundamentalls&#146;. He expressed his concern for the American Indians by sending missionaries among them and by paying them for Staten Island. He stimulated prosperity by developing land and water transportation, founding new townships, establishing a merchants' exchange, and regularizing postal service between New York and Boston. Looking to the colony's defences, he organized infantry and militia companies and enlarged New York's fortifications.<br>
<br>Over the years Lovelace's conduct in office was generally prudent and cautious, but difficulties mounted. He had altercations with neighbouring colonies over borders, and in 1672 had to contend with a political uprising in New Jersey. Frontier Indians were a continual concern; on one occasion he rushed troops to Esopus to defend settlers. His colony was rent by religious and cultural squabbles between fractious nationalities, and he lived in constant dread of Dutch invasion. He sometimes acted unilaterally, without taking into account the wishes of the Dutch residents. In 1672 he refused to entertain citizens' demands for a representative assembly, and, when they in turn communicated their refusal to pay taxes, &#145;he was so wroth he ordered the papers publicly burned&#146;. A year later, while he was visiting Connecticut, a Dutch fleet seized New York with little opposition, and he was arrested and shipped off to England.<br>
<br>Lovelace was not responsible for this loss, but he was undone by it. Dutch creditors seized his New York property, and the duke of York confiscated his English estates for a debt of &pound;7000. Other creditors enmeshed him for years in litigation. In January 1675 he was imprisoned in the Tower, and on 2 and 9 March 1675 crown officials questioned him about the loss of New York. His answers were deemed unacceptable, but the matter was not pursued and he was released in April because of his health. He retreated to Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where he had died by 22 December 1675, when administration of his estate was granted to his brother Dudley, a further administration being granted on 10 May 1686 to his sister Joan Caesar.<br>
