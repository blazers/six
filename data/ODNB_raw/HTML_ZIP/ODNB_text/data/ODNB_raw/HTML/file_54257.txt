<span class="headword">Mackenzie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spence]</span>, Dame  Helen Carruthers</span>  (1859&#150;1945), <span class="occ">educationist and public health campaigner</span>, was born on 13 April 1859 at Mortlach, Banffshire, the daughter of William Spence, merchant tailor and provost of Dufftown, and his wife, Mary McDonell. She was educated at the local village school, where she became a pupil teacher, and completed teacher training at the Church of Scotland Training College, Aberdeen. Her early career was as a teacher at various schools in Aberdeen.<br>
<br>On 12 February 1892 Helen Spence married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55652/', "Dr (William) Leslie Mackenzie (1862&#150;1935)")</script>, shortly to become the first medical inspector of schools at the Local Government Board for Scotland. Their subsequent careers were dedicated to the improvement of the physical condition of Scottish schoolchildren and jointly they were influential in the early twentieth-century movement to improve the health of children. In 1902, on behalf of the <span class="roman">royal commission (Scotland) on physical training</span>, they conducted a pioneering investigation into the physical state of Edinburgh schoolchildren. The study, organized by Helen, involved the examination of 600 children drawn from four schools deliberately chosen to enable comparison between children from middle-class and working-class areas of the city. Helen was present while her husband checked each child and she also wrote the findings. The study demonstrated that children from the poorer areas were smaller, lighter, and less healthy than children from wealthier homes. The children from Canongate School in the heart of the Old Town were especially unhealthy, with many suffering from significant medical defects; and their conclusion was that the principal factors responsible were bad housing and inadequate and unsatisfactory diets. On the basis of their study they projected that almost 30 per cent of children in Edinburgh were severely malnourished. They called for the systematic medical inspection of school children and the training of teachers in matters of health and hygiene.<br>
<br>In 1904 Helen Mackenzie, giving evidence before the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration, argued that part of the problem was the ignorance of many women in respect of nutrition, hygiene, and the care of infants. She demanded changes to the education system to enable instruction for girls in these areas. The subsequent <span class="roman">Education (Scotland) Act</span> (1908) required school boards to organize the medical inspection of schoolchildren, to provide meal services for poor children, and to provide domestic instruction for girls. The Mackenzies also co-operated in promoting the establishment of a number of special schools for mentally handicapped children, and campaigned for the effective treatment of children suffering minor ailments such as scabies and ringworm.<br>
<br>A member of the school board for Edinburgh and of the departmental committee on industrial schools, Helen Mackenzie also campaigned for an extension of day and evening continuation classes for young women. She was an original member of the East of Scotland Provincial Committee for the Training of Teachers and a governor of the Royal Institution for Deaf and Dumb Children, and she became a member of the council of the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science. Her association with the college (subsequently Queen Margaret College) extended over thirty years and she chaired the council in 1943&#150;5.<br>
<br>Helen Mackenzie was also interested in social work and particularly in the problems of female factory workers. She was secretary of the industrial section of the National Union of Women Workers and also of the Edinburgh branch of the Industrial Law Committee. Before the First World War, she lectured on this subject in the Edinburgh College and during the war assisted on a training course for welfare supervisors appointed by firms employing female labour. After the war she continued to lecture at the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Helen Mackenzie was also active in relation to mental health, female health, and rural district nursing. She was a governor of what became the Royal Scottish National Hospital for the permanent care of mentally handicapped people, and was at different times a member of the health services commission and the Mental Welfare Association. A close friend of Dr Elsie Inglis, she assisted in obtaining better maternity hospital facilities in Edinburgh. She also joined her husband in the promotion of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service which was based on peripatetic district nurses. This latter initiative achieved worldwide recognition, and similar organizations were established elsewhere, notably the Frontier Medical Service in Kentucky.<br>
<br>Helen Mackenzie was a gifted public speaker, her speeches being &#145;marked by directness and candour, and spiced with a characteristic humour that gripped attention&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 26 Sept 1945). She acquired the title Lady Mackenzie when her husband was knighted in 1919 (though she was universally referred to as Lady Leslie Mackenzie). She was appointed DBE in 1933 and received an LLD from the University of Edinburgh in 1937. She was also a fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland. For many years an active member of the Woman Citizens' Association, she tended to stress the widening opportunities open to women and also their duties as citizens.<br>
<br>The Mackenzies had no children, but they were devoted to one another, and it was a heavy blow for Lady Leslie Mackenzie when her husband died in 1935. She died at 14 Belgrave Place, Edinburgh, on 25 September 1945, and was cremated on 28 September at Warriston crematorium. The principal of the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science wrote of &#145;her courage&#146; and of &#145;her vigorous common sense, her shrewdness, her trenchant comments, her energy, her humour, her sincerity&#146;  (<span class="italic">ECDS Magazine</span>, 7).<br>
