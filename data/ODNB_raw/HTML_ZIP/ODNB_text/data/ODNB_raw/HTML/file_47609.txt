<span class="headword">Billington,  Mary Frances</span>  (1862&#150;1925), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Chalbury rectory, Wimborne, Dorset, on 6 September 1862, the only daughter (she had three brothers) of the Revd George Henry Billington (<i>d</i>. 12 Dec 1904), rector of Chalbury, and his wife, Frances Anne (daughter of the Revd T. Barber). Billington was educated at home and, once she could read at the age of eight, was encouraged to read <span class="italic">The Times</span> and other leading newspapers. In this way she absorbed some of the elements of her future profession, so much so that she was earning enough to support herself from her late teens. She began her career in journalism by writing about something she knew well&#151;Dorset ghosts&#151;and earned her first guinea by contributing to the &#145;turn-over&#146; column in Sir George Armstrong's <span class="italic">Globe</span> which, in its time, was the launch pad for many an aspiring journalist.<br>
<br>In August 1888 Billington went to Southampton to assist in the establishment of the <span class="italic">Southern Echo</span>. While there she attracted the attention of John Passmore Edwards, the proprietor/editor of the London <span class="italic">Echo</span>. A country girl born and bred, she was just the person to write a series on the recent enfranchisement of the agricultural labourer. For just over two years, she worked full-time on the <span class="italic">Echo</span>, then regarded as the most successful London evening newspaper. This gave her a thorough training in journalism in which, as she later recalled, she recorded little of public importance but widened her expertise by reporting anything from East End parties to ragged school prize days. Edwards also encouraged her to write &#145;descriptive&#146; articles, ranging from articles on penny waxwork shows to those which she described as &#145;mostly related to the seamy side of female life&#146;. Billington made good use of the advice, and introductions to other newspapers, offered by her fellow male journalists, and obtained a staff position on the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span>, prior to its establishment in 1890. She was the first woman to be appointed as a special correspondent on feminine interests. So, in 1890, she reported the funeral of Mrs Catherine Booth, the founding &#145;Mother of the Salvation Army&#146;, and, in 1891, became one of the first women to don heavy diving equipment and dive underwater at the Royal Naval Exhibition. During 1892 she branched out into reporting on the preparations in Westminster Abbey for Tennyson's funeral and, two years later, on the opening of Tower Bridge. She also played an important role in the formation of the Society for Women Journalists (SWJ) and, in May 1894, was appointed its first vice-president.<br>
<br>Then, becoming even more adventurous, Billington persuaded the editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> that too little attention had been devoted to the role of women in India and secured the commission to visit there. This yielded a series of twenty-eight articles and she published these, in 1895, as <span class="italic">Women in India</span>. When sending Gladstone a copy of the book to thank him for his help with the expedition, she thought it politic in her letter to belittle &#145;that silliest of crazes, woman's suffrage&#146;. In 1897 she was recruited to run the women's department of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, and worked on the paper until her death in 1925.<br>
<br>Throughout the First World War Billington served as president of the SWJ and also arranged some of her articles into books on how women contributed to the war effort, highlighting the bad management of some army camps. She also furthered the cause of women journalists by lecturing on journalism to SWJ members and to the London School of Journalism. She once wrote that for women to succeed in the male-dominated world of British journalism they needed &#145;true grit&#146;&#151;something she exhibited in her own pioneering career.<br>
<br>Throughout most of her working life in London, Billington lived at 23 Warwick Square, Belgrave Road, London, and she died there on 27 August 1925. She was buried in the Chalbury church where her father had served as rector from 1861 to 1904.<br>
