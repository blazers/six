<span class="headword">Backhouse family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1770&#150;1945), <span class="occ">naturalists and horticulturists</span>, came to prominence with James [i] Backhouse (1721&#150;1798), who founded the Backhouse Bank in Darlington, co. Durham, in 1774 with his sons Jonathan (1747&#150;1826) and James [ii] (1757&#150;1804). It was Jonathan Backhouse who initiated the family's connection with horticulture, by following the mid-eighteenth-century fashion for large-scale tree planting on his estates at Weardale in co. Durham.<h2>
<a name="DescendantsofJonathanBackhouse17471826"></a>Descendants of Jonathan Backhouse 1747&#150;1826</h2>The tree planting of Jonathan Backhouse was an undertaking continued by three of his four sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47953/', "Jonathan Backhouse (1779&#150;1842)")</script>, better known as a supporter of the Stockton and Darlington Railway; Edward (1781&#150;1860), founder of the Backhouse Bank in Sunderland; and William [i]. All three brothers were awarded medals by the Royal Society of Arts for their enterprise. However, the youngest of the three, <a name="cosubject_56509"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Backhouse</span>  (1779&#150;1844)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Darlington on 17 November 1779, was much more than a tree planter, and had a considerable reputation as a botanist in the north of England. He had close contact with the Newcastle botanist Nathaniel John Winch (1768&#150;1838), with whom he corresponded from 1805 until 1831 and to whom he forwarded a list of rare Durham plants in February 1805. He was interested in British grasses and cultivated specimens sent to him by friends and correspondents who included James Janson (I'Anson) (1784&#150;1821), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23898/', "Edward Robson (1763&#150;1813)")</script> (who was related by marriage to James [ii] Backhouse), William Brunton (1775&#150;1806), the Revd James Dalton (1764&#150;1843), and George Don (1764&#150;1814). William [i] died suddenly on 9 June 1844 at the Quaker meeting-house in Darlington. His plant collection was considered of some significance; it was unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1865, when on loan to J. G. Baker.<br>
<br>William [i] Backhouse had married Mary Dixon (1783&#150;1874) on 27 March 1806; they had two sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_56506"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Backhouse</span>  (1807&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>, probably born in Darlington, continued the family interest in botany, became a competent entomologist, ornithologist, geologist, and meteorologist, and developed a number of new varieties of <i>Narcissus</i> (daffodils). Initially, however, William [ii] was employed in the family banking business; he worked in Newcastle following the opening of a branch of the Backhouse Bank there in 1825. While there his interests in natural history grew, and he became a founder member of the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle upon Tyne in 1829. He was a competent entomologist, making extensive notes on Lepidoptera captured on the Backhouse estates in Durham. His interest in meteorology is revealed in diaries devoted to daily temperature and weather reports, and in requests from correspondents for readings from his &#145;weather gauge&#146;. Watercolour drawings of local coastal sections, and extensive transcriptions, indicate a knowledge of geology. He formed a collection of stuffed birds and showed promise as an artist, producing watercolours, steel-engravings, and pencil drawings of a variety of subjects. After William [ii] returned to the Darlington bank he lived at St John's Hall, near Wolsingham, and there began his major horticultural work, the development of new varieties of <i>Narcissus</i>. In 1833 he married Amelia Flyer (<i>d</i>. 1837). In 1843 he married Katherine Aldam (1815&#150;1868); they had four sons. William [ii] Backhouse died on 3 April 1869 at Chapeltown in Leeds. After his death his daffodil collection was purchased by Peter Barr and used in association with that of Edward Leeds (1802&#150;1877) to establish a classification system for narcissi.<br>
<br>Three of William [ii] Backhouse's four sons from his second marriage, Charles James, Henry, and Robert Ormston, maintained the family interest in daffodils. Charles James (<i>b</i>. 1848) continued to live at St John's, while Henry (1849&#150;1936) reared daffodils in Darlington between 1895 and 1907 and in Bournemouth from 1907 to 1925. <a name="cosubject_61916"></a><span class="headword">Robert Ormston Backhouse</span>  (1854&#150;1940)<span class="occ"></span> married Sarah Elizabeth Dodgson (1857&#150;1921) in 1884, and two years later moved to Sutton Court, Sutton St Nicholas, Herefordshire. Furthering the Backhouse interest in narcissi, Sarah Elizabeth achieved national fame for her efforts and was awarded the Barr cup in 1916 for her hybridizing work. Together Sarah and Robert had begun to search for a pink-cupped daffodil, but it was not until 1923 (two years after his wife's death) that Robert astounded the horticultural world with the first pink-cupped, white-perianthed variety, which he named &#145;Mrs R. O. Backhouse&#146;. He died at Sutton Court on 10 April 1940.<br>
<br>Robert and Sarah Backhouse's son, <a name="cosubject_61917"></a><span class="headword">William Ormston Backhouse</span>  (1885&#150;1962)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 20 February 1885 and educated at Bradfield College and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He worked for five years at the Cambridge Plant Breeding Station and the John Innes Institution, but left Britain to take up a post as an agricultural geneticist with the Argentine government. He established a number of wheat-breeding stations in Argentina, then moved to Patagonia, where on his estates he reared pigs, grew apples and other fruits, and started intensive honey production. He obtained narcissi from his parents, and in South America continued the family tradition set by his grandfather. He specialized in red-trumpeted daffodils, and on his return to England and Sutton Court in 1945 continued to develop these varieties. It was at Sutton Court that William Ormston Backhouse died on 7 August 1962.<h2>
<a name="DescendantsofJamesiiBackhouse17571804"></a>Descendants of James [ii] Backhouse 1757&#150;1804</h2>James [ii] Backhouse, founder (together with his father and brother) of the Backhouse Bank, married Mary Dearman of Thorne, Yorkshire. Their sons were Nathan (1788&#150;1805), Thomas (1792&#150;1845), and <a name="cosubject_56507"></a><span class="headword">James [iii] Backhouse</span>  (1794&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>. James [iii] Backhouse, who was born in Darlington on 8 July 1794, was encouraged to study plants by his elder brother. He was educated in Leeds but on his return to Darlington began to explore nearby Teesdale with the lead miner John Binks (1766&#150;1817), who is credited with the discovery of many of the area's rare plants. Binks was undoubtedly a major influence on James [iii], as were his uncle Edward Robson, his cousin William [i] Backhouse, the Newcastle botanist Nathaniel John Winch, and William Hooker (1785&#150;1865).<br>
<br>In 1815 James [iii] Backhouse, together with his brother Thomas, purchased the York nursery of John and George Telford, and by 1821 the business was flourishing. In 1822 James [iii] married Deborah Lowe (1793&#150;1827) of Worcester. He began missionary work in York in 1824 and on 3 September 1831, having the previous year obtained the necessary documentation and in the company of George Washington Walker (1800&#150;1859), he boarded the <i>Science</i>, bound for Australia. He stayed there until 1838, carrying out missionary duties and humanitarian work, but also collecting plants and seeds which he sent back to the York nursery and to Hooker in Glasgow. On the return journey he visited Mauritius <i>en route</i> for South Africa, where he continued his missionary duties until December 1840, finally arriving back in York on 21 February 1841. Backhouse described his travels in two books, his <span class="italic">Narrative of a Visit to the Australian Colonies</span> (1843) and <span class="italic">Narrative of a Visit to the Mauritius and South Africa</span> (1844), both illustrated with engravings by Edward Backhouse (1808&#150;1879) of Sunderland, from original sketches by the author. Hooker and William Harvey (1811&#150;1866) recognized the value of Backhouse's botanical observations, naming a myrtaceous shrub <i>Backhousia</i> in 1845.<br>
<br>Throughout his Australian journey James [iii] Backhouse had been in correspondence with his son, <a name="cosubject_61918"></a><span class="headword">James [iv] Backhouse</span>  (1825&#150;1890)<span class="occ"></span>, and with his brother Thomas, the latter being responsible for the management and development of the nursery in James [iii]'s absence. James [iv] was born on 22 October 1825 in York. He inherited his father's love of botany, and from 1843 the two men explored upper Teesdale and other mountainous areas of Britain and Europe in search of alpine plants. Father and son jointly directed the growth of the York nursery from 1845 on the death of Thomas Backhouse, supervising its move to a 100 acre site at Holgate, York, in 1853. On 7 June 1855 James [iv] married Mary Robson of Dalton. He wrote a <span class="italic">Monograph of the British Hieracia</span> (1856) and in the pages of <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span> recorded his botanical discoveries in the upland areas of Teesdale and elsewhere in Britain. His son, <a name="cosubject_61919"></a><span class="headword">James [v] Backhouse</span>  (1861&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 14 April 1861 in York.<br>
<br>In addition, James [iv] was a keen archaeologist and geologist; he explored the caves of Teesdale in search of archaeological material and with his son James [v] formed an excellent personal museum. The Teesdale cave was excavated by the two men between 1878 and 1888; these explorations are described in James [v]'s <span class="italic">Upper Teesdale Past and Present</span> (1896). James [v] had close connections with the Yorkshire Museum, York, being an active member of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and an honorary curator of zoology; the museum holds his collection of cave material and 4000 bird skins. However, he is best known as an <span class="occ">ornithologist</span> and as the author of the <span class="italic">Handbook of European Birds</span> (1890). On 15 May 1890 he married Mabel Grace Robson of Saffron Walden. The following year he formed a new company, Backhouse Nurseries (York) Ltd, which faced considerable competition from other plantsmen. Most of the land was sold in 1921 and the nursery finally ceased trading in 1955, ten years after James [v] died in 1945.<h2>
<a name="DescendantsofEdwardBackhouse17811860"></a>Descendants of Edward Backhouse 1781&#150;1860</h2>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/984/', "Edward Backhouse (1808&#150;1879)")</script>, born in Darlington on 8 May 1808, was a son of Edward Backhouse (1781&#150;1860), Jonathan Backhouse's son. A philanthropist, artist, pioneer photographer, and historian, he is best known for his <span class="italic">Early Church History</span> (with C. Taylor, 1884) and other religious works. A younger brother was Thomas James Backhouse (1810&#150;1857), who married Margaret Richardson (1818&#150;1854). Their son <a name="cosubject_61920"></a><span class="headword">Thomas William Backhouse</span>  (1842&#150;1920) was born on 14 August 1842. He lived at West Hendon House, Sunderland, and from the observatory he built there began the work which led to his being recognized as an outstanding <span class="occ">meteorologist and astronomer</span>. He began in 1858 to compile his <span class="italic">Astronomical Journal</span>, which eventually extended to thirty-six volumes, and published a series of fourteen maps of stars, accompanied by <span class="italic">A Catalogue of 9842 Stars Visible to the Naked Eye</span> (1911); the star maps were completed after his death. Thomas Backhouse's accurate meteorological observations were uninterrupted from 1857 until 1919; his contribution to the science was recognized by the Royal Meteorological Society, which appointed him as vice-president in 1918 and 1919. He died on 13 March 1920.<h2>
<a name="Lastingsignificance"></a>Lasting significance</h2>For almost 200 years members of the Backhouse family were actively involved in English horticulture, as tree planters, nurserymen, breeders, or botanists. Their name lives on in narcissi such as &#145;Mrs R. O. Backhouse&#146; and &#145;Backhouse's Giant&#146;. The remains of their York nursery (auctioned in 1955) later became a park run by York city council. The marriage between Jonathan Backhouse (1779&#150;1842) and Hannah Chapman (coheir of Joseph Gurney, a private banker in Norwich) began a process which ended in 1896 with the Backhouse Bank's becoming a part of Barclay &amp; Co. of Lombard Street (later to become Barclays, one of the &#145;big five&#146; clearing banks).<br>
