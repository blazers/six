<span class="headword">Malachy</span> <span class="st"> [St Malachy, M&aacute;el M&aacute;edoc Ua Morgair]</span>  (1094/5&#150;1148), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born into an established ecclesiastical family in either 1094 or 1095, the son of M&uacute;gr&oacute;n (<i>d</i>. 1102), <i>fer l&eacute;iginn</i> (lector) of Armagh.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Malachy (as he is usually known, rather than by his Irish name, M&aacute;el M&aacute;edoc Ua Morgair) trained as a cleric at Armagh, where he came under the influence of an ascetic teacher, Imar Ua h&Aacute;edach&aacute;in, who was attached to the <i>recles</i>, the church of the monastic community of St Peter and St Paul, Armagh, and who died in Rome in 1134. Notwithstanding the canonical requirements for ordination, he was ordained deacon before the age of twenty-five and priest before the age of thirty by Cellach (Celsus), archbishop of Armagh. According to Malachy's biographer, Bernard of Clairvaux, Cellach made him his <i>vices</i>, or deputy, in which role he showed himself zealous in the cause of reform, instituting the customs of the holy Roman church, especially canonical hours, and the sacraments of confession, confirmation, and marriage at Armagh. So as to ensure that what he taught conformed with the practice of the universal church, Malachy went to Lismore to place himself under the ecclesiastical discipline of M&aacute;el Is&uacute; (Malchus) Ua hAinmire, bishop of Waterford, who had been trained as a monk at Winchester.<h2>
<a name="HeadofBangorandbishopofConnor"></a>Head of Bangor and bishop of Connor</h2>In 1123 &Oacute;engus Ua Gorm&aacute;in, <i>comarba Comgaill</i> (that is, head of the church of Bangor) and bishop of Ulaid, died at Lismore. This appears to have occasioned Malachy's recall by those who had sent him there; at the command of Imar, he took ten brethren with him to inaugurate his independent career as a church reformer by reviving conventual life at the secularized monastic site of Bangor, although he faced opposition from locally entrenched interests. Indeed, he failed to gain possession of the landed estates, contenting himself with the monastic site alone, where he erected a new wooden church, subsequently to be rebuilt in stone, despite local opponents voicing the argument <i>Scoti sumus, non Galli</i>&#151;&#145;We are Irishmen, not French&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sancti Bernardi opera</span>, 3.365). Bernard of Clairvaux indicates that Malachy had a familial connection with Bangor via his <i>avunculus</i>, described as a rich and powerful man, who was prepared to cede Bangor to him. It is not certain whether <i>avunculus</i> should be interpreted in the late Latin sense of maternal rather than paternal uncle. Bernard's allusions to events at Bangor are in fact so generalized that it is difficult to reconstruct the circumstances of Malachy's accession. In 1131 the death was recorded of Muirchertach Ua hInnrechtaig, head of the church of Bangor. It is not possible to prove that Muirchertach was related to Malachy; it is equally possible that Malachy was related to &Oacute;engus Ua Gorm&aacute;in. Malachy appears to have taken possession of no more than the old conventual site, and Muirchertach may have remained as lay controller of the Bangor estates until his death.<br>
<br>In addition to his role as head of a reformed monastic community at Bangor, in 1124 Malachy was consecrated by Cellach as bishop for the see of Connor, though he may have remained resident at Bangor. In 1127, according to Bernard of Clairvaux, an attack by an unnamed northern king forced him into exile. The attack may be related to the killings in that year of &Aacute;ed (Niall) Mac Duinnsl&eacute;ibe and Eochaid Ua Mathgamna, kings of Ulaid, and the subsequent raiding in Ulaid by a son of Mac Lochlainn, king of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain. Malachy sought refuge in Munster, and probably once again at Lismore, where he encountered Cormac Mac Carthaig, temporarily exiled king of Munster, whom he persuaded to return to the kingship, and with whom he was to collaborate in promoting church reform. Cormac's beneficence enabled Malachy to construct within his kingdom the monastery of &#145;Ibracense&#146; (unidentified).<h2>
<a name="ThearchbishopricofArmagh"></a>The archbishopric of Armagh</h2>In 1129 Archbishop Cellach, while staying at Ardpatrick, Limerick, and realizing that he was close to death, made what was effectively a testament (<i>quasi testamentum</i>) designating Malachy as his successor, enjoining especially on the kings of Munster that his wish be respected. Cellach was buried at Lismore on 4 April 1129; and the very next day Muirchertach Mac Domnaill, like Cellach a member of the hereditary secularized ecclesiastical dynasty of U&iacute; S&iacute;naig which had maintained an almost two-hundred-year monopoly of ecclesiastical offices at Armagh, was installed in the latter city. Three years after Cellach's death, in 1132, on the urgings of M&aacute;el Is&uacute;, bishop of Waterford, and Gilbert, bishop of Limerick and native papal legate, who had convened the bishops and rulers of the land, Malachy was consecrated for Armagh on the understanding, according to Bernard of Clairvaux, that he would be allowed to resign the see when the U&iacute; S&iacute;naig monopoly had been broken. In 1133 a circuit of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain and collection of tribute by Muirchertach as head of the church of Armagh is recorded, indicating whence Muirchertach derived his main support.<br>
<br>For two years Malachy exercised his episcopal functions without gaining entry to Armagh city, and it was not until 1134, following Muirchertach's death, that he attempted to take possession of the insignia and temporalities of the church of Armagh, which, as Bernard of Clairvaux remarked, was vital to securing recognition as archbishop of Armagh from a &#145;foolish and unwise people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sancti Bernardi opera</span>, 3.334). His installation at Armagh was opposed by the Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, but he had the support of Donnchad Ua Cerbaill, king of Airgialla. Another U&iacute; S&iacute;naig candidate, Ma&iacute;le Niall mac &Aacute;eda meic &Iacute;su (<i>d</i>. 1139), a brother of Cellach, immediately replaced Muirchertach, attempted to oppose Malachy's installation, and, according to the annals of the four masters, succeeded in temporarily displacing him in 1135. A visitation of Munster by Malachy is recorded in 1134, and he may have been present at the consecration in that year of the Romanesque chapel endowed by Cormac Mac Carthaig on the Rock of Cashel. On 7 July 1135, following the death of Flann Ua S&iacute;naig, its hereditary keeper, Malachy was obliged to pay to gain possession of the <i>Bachall &Iacute;su</i>, believed to be the crozier of St Patrick, the principal relic of the church of Armagh.<h2>
<a name="BishopofDown"></a>Bishop of Down</h2>In 1136, having asserted the case for canonical consecration and broken the U&iacute; S&iacute;naig monopoly at Armagh, Malachy resigned that see to Gilla Meic Liac (Gelasius), abbot of Derry since 1121, in the interests of conciliation and the expectation that the latter would enjoy the protection of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, newly succeeded to the kingship of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, who had close associations with Derry. Having in the meantime consecrated a bishop of Connor, Malachy now assumed the title bishop of Down, though it is possible that he never actually resided at Down and chose instead to locate himself at Bangor. In early 1139 he undertook a mission to Pope Innocent II to request formal papal approval and palls for the archbishoprics of Armagh and Cashel, travelling via Scotland and the court of King David, which at this time, when much of northern England had recently come under Scottish rule, was as likely to be at Carlisle as at Roxburgh or Edinburgh. On the way he visited York, where Waldef, the saintly prior of Kirkham, came to meet him, and later Clairvaux, where he formed a warm friendship with his future biographer, Abbot Bernard. He went on to Rome where Pope Innocent II did not accede to his request, but instructed Malachy (whom he commissioned as a native papal legate for Ireland) to return to Ireland and summon a general church council, so that a more formal and demonstrably unanimous request for palls could be made. On his homeward journey, Malachy again visited Clairvaux and left four of his associates to be trained as monks in the Cistercian observance; these were subsequently augmented by others sent from Ireland on his return. He travelled back via northern England and Scotland, and again stopped at the court of King David, who was himself a noted patron of monasticism and of ecclesiastical reform. The first Cistercian monastery in Ireland was to be founded at Mellifont, Louth, in 1142.<br>
<br>In 1139 Malachy had also visited the monastery of Arrouaise near Arras and had its rule and liturgical practices copied, as was recorded in 1179 by its abbot, Gautier. Malachy introduced the austere Arrouaisian observances into Ireland, persuading clergy in cathedral churches in particular to adopt them, the first Arrouasian community in Ireland being established at the cathedral church and priory of St Mary's Abbey, Louth, in 1142. Mellifont and Louth Abbey were situated in the kingdom of Airgialla, the protection and patronage of whose king, Donnchad Ua Cerbaill, enabled Malachy to use Airgialla as a trial ground for his reform strategies. Malachy's brother, Gilla Cr&iacute;st (Christianus), was bishop of Airgialla (or Clogher) between 1135 and 1138; and Malachy also benefited from a close working relationship with Gilla Cr&iacute;st's successor, &Aacute;ed (Edanus) Ua C&aacute;ellaide, whom he chose and consecrated. Bernard of Clairvaux depicts Malachy as travelling extensively in the period 1139&#150;48 in the north of Ireland, in Munster, and in Leinster, preaching reform practices. In Cork he resolved a disputed episcopal election by installing an outsider; in Lismore he confuted a scholar who denied the doctrine of the real presence in the eucharist. His position as papal legate gave him the authority to intervene in such cases, though his legateship may have lapsed temporarily following the death of Innocent II in 1143. In 1148 he consecrated the church of the Augustinian community at Knock, near Louth, which had been built under the auspices of &Aacute;ed Ua C&aacute;ellaide and Donnchad Ua Cerbaill.<h2>
<a name="Deathandsainthood"></a>Death and sainthood</h2>In the same year, availing himself of the circumstance that Pope Eugenius III, a former Cistercian monk of Clairvaux, was visiting France, Malachy undertook a second journey to the continent, for the purpose of making a formal request for palls, having first convened a synod on the island of Inis P&aacute;draig, Dublin. He travelled via Scotland and the court of King David, making arrangements on the way for the foundation of a Cistercian house at what may have been Soulseat in Wigtownshire, and avoided travelling through England because King Stephen denied him passage, possibly because of his status as a papal legate. However, he made a detour to visit the canons of Guisborough, in Yorkshire, near the then Anglo-Scottish border. He arrived at Clairvaux about 13 or 14 October, where he met the English monastic reformer Gilbert of Sempringham, to whom he gave a staff. He fell ill and died, in his fifty-fourth year, in the presence of Abbot Bernard on the night of 1&#150;2 November 1148 and was buried at Clairvaux.<br>
<br>Malachy's aspiration for palls and formal papal approval of the Irish diocesan constitution was to be realized at the Synod of Kells in 1152, presided over by the papal legate, Cardinal Giovanni Paparo. The monks of Clairvaux initiated proceedings for his canonization, which Pope Clement III confirmed on 6 July 1190. His feast day subsequently was celebrated on 3 November, so as to avoid All Souls' day (2 November). Malachy shares with Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail (Laurence O'Toole), archbishop of Dublin, who also died on the continent, the distinction of having been the only Irish saints to be formally canonized before Oliver Plunket in 1975. The most important sources for Malachy's career are Bernard of Clairvaux's biography, written in 1149, two commemorative sermons preached on the day of his death and on the first anniversary of his death, and a hymn and epitaph, as well as three letters written by Bernard to him during his lifetime. Bernard stated that he wrote his life at the request of Abbot Congan, &#145;my reverend brother and sweet friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sancti Bernardi opera</span>, 3.309), undoubtedly one of the Irish trained at Clairvaux, and that a record of the deeds of Malachy had been provided from Ireland. Malachy (along with his brother, Bishop Gilla Cr&iacute;st) is also mentioned in the <span class="italic">Visio Tnugdali</span>, written by Marcus, monk of the <i>Schottenkloster</i> (Irish monastery) of Regensburg, in 1149, as among the denizens of heaven whom Tnugdal encountered in his vision in the company of St Patrick. He was still remembered late in the following century. About 1272 Robert (V) de Brus, lord of Annandale in south-west Scotland, endowed Clairvaux with land in either Annandale or Cumberland, to pay for lights at Malachy's tomb. His object was to lift the curse which the saint had reputedly laid on a distant ancestor, for hanging a robber after promising Malachy that he would spare him.<br>
<br>Malachy's career has to be set in the context of the church reform movement which sought to bring the Irish church more into conformity with the organizational structures of the contemporary European church. He played a crucial role in securing a canonically consecrated succession at Armagh, in attaining papal recognition for the diocesan constitution of the Irish church as it was first outlined at the Synod of R&aacute;ith Bressail in 1111 and later refined at Kells in 1152, and in introducing the Cistercian and Augustinian rules, the latter especially, though not exclusively, according to the Arrouaisian observance. Opposition to his reform policies which he experienced during his lifetime outlived him: Augustinian canons whom he had installed at Saul, Down, were attacked and ejected by local unreformed clerics in 1170.<br>
