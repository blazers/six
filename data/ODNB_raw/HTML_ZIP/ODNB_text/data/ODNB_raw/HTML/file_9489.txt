</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fischer <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Norris]</span>,  Catherine Maria</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Kitty Fisher]</span>  (1741?&#150;1767), <span class="occ">courtesan</span>, was probably the Catharine Fischer born on 1 June 1741 in London, the daughter of John Henry Fischer (<i>d</i>. in or before 1766) and his wife, Ann, who was baptized in St Anne's, Soho, Westminster, on 10 June 1741. Kitty Fisher's first names were recorded as Catherine Maria in the burial register and she signed herself &#145;Cath. Maria Norris heretofore Fischer&#146; in the St George's, Hanover Square, marriage register. Her father was said to have been German (and Bleackley says that he was a Lutheran) and his trade was variously reported as stay-maker and silver-chaser. Ann Fischer was listed as a widow in the application for a special licence for the marriage on 22 March 1766 of John Pollard to Sarah Louisa Fischer, minor, presumably a younger sister to Catherine.<br>
<br>Little is known of Kitty Fisher's early background, although she is recorded as having lived in Paddington before she became famous. Her parents were described as poor, and she was said to have started work in a milliner's shop. Her career as a courtesan allegedly began after she was seduced and then deserted by Ensign (later Lieutenant-General) Anthony George Martin. The <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> for September 1771, however, claimed that Captain (later Admiral) Augustus Keppel first launched her career, while Edward Thompson in the satirical poem <span class="italic">The Meretriciad</span> declared that there were too many candidates to identify him.<br>
<br>By the winter of 1758 Kitty Fisher was in the public eye, and for the next five years she was referred to as one of the top courtesans in London, if not the most prominent of all. Numerous satirical poems and essays, such as Charles Churchill's <span class="italic">The Ghost</span> and the anonymous <span class="italic">Kitty's Stream</span> (1759), as well as newspaper and magazine articles and private correspondence paid tribute to the &#145;celebrated&#146; Kitty Fisher whose beauty and lively sense of humour and adventure captivated a diverse array of observers. She soon became associated with the most fashionable activities and prominent men in London. According to Horace Walpole she was recognized in a London park by both the young Prince Frederick William and his elder brother the prince of Wales (afterwards George III). On another occasion George II apparently had her introduced to William Pitt as a joke. Casanova was impressed by her magnificent dress and charm, while Dr Johnson expressed regret that he had missed meeting her.<br>
<br>Well known for riding through St James's Park and the Mall, Kitty Fisher prompted a flurry of publicity when she fell from her horse there in March 1759. A poem &#145;On K&#151; F&#151;'s Falling from her Horse&#146; reminded her that this was not her first &#145;fall&#146; and that she should reform her behaviour  (<span class="italic">Universal Magazine</span>, March 1759, 152). More strident was the broadside <span class="italic">Horse and away to St James's Park, or, A trip for the noontide air. Who rides fastest, Miss Kitty Fisher or her gay gallant</span> [1760?], which argued that her luxurious life was &#145;enough to debauch half the Women in London&#146;. This apparently spawned a satirical print, <span class="italic">The merry accident, or a print in the morning. A chair, a chair for the lady. Who rides fastest, Miss Kitty Fish&#150;r, or her gay gallant</span>, which depicts Fisher after her fall. She lies on the ground, her dress disordered and her legs visible. Several of the male spectators comment on her situation, including one who repeats the criticism made in the broadside&#151;that her example will lead other women to become whores. Her influence was lamented by observers as diverse as the satirical poet Edward Thompson and Lady Caroline Fox, who wrote dismissively of the &#145;Kitty Fisher style &hellip; in dress or manner, which all the young women affect now&#146;  (Lady Caroline Fox to countess of Kildare, 25 Oct [1759], <span class="italic">Correspondence of Emily, Duchess of Leinster</span>, 1.262). In 1760 a pamphlet declared: &#145;You, Madam, are become the Favourite of the Public and the Darling of the Age&#146;  (Trusty, 6).<br>
<br>For more than perhaps any other eighteenth-century courtesan, oil portraits helped to boost Kitty Fisher's fame. Sir Joshua Reynolds painted at least four portraits of her between 1759 and 1766, prompting rumours that they were lovers. A portrait which depicted her in an elegant dress with lace sleeves, seated before an open letter inscribed &#145;2 June 1759 / My dearest Kit&#146;, was said to be the model for Allan Ramsay's 1761 portrait of Lady Caroline Fox's niece, Lady Susan Fox-Strangways. Another portrait, which depicted her as Cleopatra dissolving the pearl in a wine cup, also attracted attention. Someone wrote under the painting:<blockquote>
<div>To her famed character how just thy right!<br>
</div>
<div>Thy mind as wanton, and thy form as bright<br>
</div> (Leslie and Taylor, 163n.)</blockquote>while Thompson claimed:<blockquote>
<div>E'en <i>Cleopatra</i> with her orient grace,<br>
</div>
<div>Was but a <i>Gypsie</i> to thy lov'lier face.<br>
</div> (Thompson, <span class="italic">The Meretriciad</span>, 14)</blockquote>This portrait was apparently painted for Sir Charles Bingham, bt. Both of these paintings were engraved, and these reproductions along with other engravings further publicized her career. Nathaniel Hone's portrait of 1765 depicts the courtesan seated beside a bowl full of goldfish, in which a cat is attempting to fish. This scene is a clever pun on her name, her love of gold, and her relationships with men. It recalls titles such as <span class="italic">Kitty's Stream, or, The Noblemen Turned Fisher-Men</span> (1759), and <span class="italic">Fun upon fun &hellip; Miss Kitty Fisher's merry thought. No joke like a true joke. Come, who'l fish in my fishpond?</span> The latter was the title of plate 12 of Paul Sandby's <span class="italic">Cries of London</span> (1760), which depicts a street hawker selling an actual pamphlet, <span class="italic">Kitty F&#151;r's Merry Thought, or, No Joke Like a True Joke</span> (1760). The painting also recalls Thomas Gray's poem of 1747, &#145;Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>What female heart can gold despise?<br>
</div>
<div>What cat's averse to fish?<br>
</div> (Gray, &#145;Ode&#146;, ed. Lonsdale, 28)</blockquote>Several other portraits are said to be of her, all depicting a young woman of medium build with brown hair and blue eyes, although, as John Kerslake notes, &#145;there has been a tendency to identify girls by Reynolds with a retrouss&eacute; nose as Kitty Fisher&#146;  (Kerslake, 1.75). The extent of her fame was demonstrated through a letter signed C. Fisher published in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> on 30 March 1759 which complained that she had been &#145;abused in public papers, exposed in print-shops, and &hellip; some wretches &hellip; would impose upon the public, by daring to publish her memoirs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1759, 168).<br>
<br>Kitty Fisher's extravagance was legendary. One probably apocryphal story recorded that she once ate a &pound;100 bank note (Casanova gives its value as 1000 guineas) on buttered bread. Another claimed that she ordered that Prince Edward, duke of York, should not be re-admitted to her house (possibly in Carrington Street, Mayfair, or Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square) after he left a less generous than expected payment of 50 guineas. The members of White's Club were said to have raised a subscription to fund her extravagance, while all the members of Arthur's Club were reported to have enjoyed her pleasures. She is said to have had liaisons with the minor politician Sir Thomas Medlycott; George, Baron Anson of Soberton, the admiral; Thomas Bromley, second Baron Montfort, a notorious spendthrift; Joseph Salvador, merchant; and John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, the politician. The &#145;T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&#146; series in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> claimed that two leading army officers, Field Marshal John, Earl Ligonier, and William Stanhope, second earl of Harrington, had affairs with her because she was the most prominent courtesan at the time. Despite her popularity among noblemen, only two were reported ever to have considered marrying her, and both&#151;John, second Earl Poulett, and Henry Herbert, tenth earl of Pembroke&#151;were said to have thought better of the idea, although the latter (who would have to have first met her at an early stage in her career, as he married in 1756) allegedly paid her an annuity of &pound;1000. On 19 August 1763 her coachman, Matthew Dodd, was hanged for raping a farmer's daughter. Crowds delayed the execution, causing George III to comment on the immorality of the times. She was next recorded as living with a young gentleman, Mr Chetwynd, passing as his housekeeper Mrs Brown, until his death from consumption in the south of France.<br>
<br>In 1766 Kitty Fisher married John Norris (1740&#150;1811), MP for Rye from 1762 to 1774, captain or governor of Deal Castle from 1766 to 1774, and son of John Norris, former MP and landowner, of Hemsted, Benenden, Kent. The marriage took place first in Scotland on 25 October 1766 in Trinity Church, Haddington, and then by special licence of the archbishop of Canterbury (obtained by the bridegroom on 2 December 1766) on 4 December 1766 in St George's, Hanover Square, London. News of the marriage disappointed contemporaries such as Lady Mary Coke and the bridegroom's father. Other reports credited the new Mrs Norris with reforming her husband's dissolute habits and shaky finances. She was said to be a kind benefactor of the local poor, and to amaze villagers with her prowess as a horsewoman, jumping every gate rather than opening or going round it. Three months later, however, she was reported as &#145;in a decline&#146;  (Bleackley, 92), apparently from consumption, although lead poisoning from the use of cosmetics and smallpox were also blamed. <i>En route</i> to the Bristol Hotwells for relief, she apparently collapsed at Bath on 9 March 1767 and died next day at the Three Tuns tavern in Stall Street &#145;in her husband's arms&#146;  (Bleackley, 93&#150;4). She was reported to have been laid in state in her best dress and to have been greatly mourned by her husband. Her burial (which according to Bleackley took place in the family vault in the chancel of the parish church) was recorded in the register of Sts George and Margaret, Benenden, Kent, on 23 March 1767.<br>
<br>Edward Thompson marked Kitty Fisher's passing with a humorous poem, <span class="italic">On the Death of Kitty Fisher</span>, which describes &#145;St Kitty&#146; as being &#145;put to the shift!&#146; and as &#145;the Fisher of Men&#146;  (Thompson, <span class="italic">Court of Cupid</span>, 2.130), while an epigram entitled &#145;On Kitty Fisher's Dying Soon after she was Married&#146; ran:<blockquote>
<div>She wedded to live honest&#151;but, when tried,<br>
</div>
<div>the experiment she liked not&#151;and so died.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Epitaphs</span>, collected by T. Webb, 1775, 2.108, quoted in Hardy, 86)</blockquote>Henry Harington published a song in three parts, entitled <span class="italic">An Elegy: on Kitty Fisher Lying in State at Bath</span> (1780?) which paid tribute to her beauty. In 1782 George Selwyn recorded receiving verses on Kitty Fisher. And in 1788 Henry Swinburne described a French noblewoman's appearance &#145;like an embalmed Egyptian queen, or Kitty Fisher, when exposed full dressed, after her death&#146;  (Swinburne, 43). The character of the obliging courtesan Kitty Willis in Hannah Cowley's 1781 comedy <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span> was based upon her. Her name also lived on in the expression &#145;My eye, Kitty Fisher!&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 3rd ser., 8, 1865, 82) and a nursery rhyme, which began:<blockquote>
<div>Lucy Locket lost her pocket,<br>
</div>
<div>Kitty Fisher found it:<br>
</div>
<div>The deuce a farthing was there in't&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>Only the binding round it.<br>
</div> (ibid., 155)</blockquote>While Kitty Fisher was only one of many courtesans to gain public acclaim in mid-eighteenth-century London, the depth as well as breadth of her celebrity set her apart from her contemporaries.<br>
