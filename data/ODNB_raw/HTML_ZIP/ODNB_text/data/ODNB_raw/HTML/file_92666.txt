<span class="headword">West,  Peter Anthony</span>  (1920&#150;2003), <span class="occ">broadcaster and sports commentator</span>, was born on 12 August 1920 at 39 Sefton Road, Croydon, Surrey, the only child of Harold William West, businessman, and his wife, Dorcas Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. He was educated at Yardley Court preparatory school in Tonbridge and Cranbrook School, Kent, where he was captain of the rugby, hockey, and cricket teams and head of school. By his own admission he was academically lazy and twice failed attempts at university scholarships before going to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Duke of Wellington's regiment, but the onset of spondylitis ensured that he saw no active service, and he was invalided out of the army in 1944. After the war he worked briefly for the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association, where he met his future wife, Pauline Mary Pike, secretary, daughter of Evan Cuthbert Pike, accountant. They married on 14 September 1946 at Christ Church, Hounslow (she was then aged twenty-two), and had a daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>The press officer at the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association encouraged him to seek work in the media and in 1947, then working for the Exchange Telegraph Agency, West gained his entr&eacute;e into broadcasting after offering to dictate C. B. Fry's copy to the <span class="italic">Sunday Graphic</span> from the press box at Taunton; Fry, impressed by West's charm and clear diction, recommended him to Seymour (Lobby) de Lotbini&egrave;re, head of outside broadcasts for the BBC, who gave him the opportunity to do some cricket commentaries. In the early 1950s West chose to focus on television rather than radio, where the cricket commentators seemed well established. Despite remaining a freelance throughout his career, he commented on test cricket every year from 1952 to 1986. Extremely versatile, he also supported Dan Maskell's coverage of Wimbledon tennis from 1955 to 1982 and reported on virtually every sport covered by BBC television.<br>
<br>In 1953 West appeared on the panel game <span class="italic">What's My Line</span>, which opened up a second, parallel career as host or comp&egrave;re of numerous BBC game shows and other non-sporting programmes. From 1957 to 1972 (despite stating that his wife wore shin guards when they danced) he hosted the hugely successful series <span class="italic">Come Dancing</span>. From 1961 to 1966 he introduced the annual Miss World contest. His programmes for children included <span class="italic">Question Marks</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Ask Your Dad</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">What's New?</span> (1962&#150;4), a science programme. In the 1970s West diversified into print journalism, as the rugby correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1971&#150;82), and he later covered both rugby and cricket for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>.<br>
<br>West's father had made a fortune in the oil business and retired early to become a poultry farmer, but this venture failed in the financial crisis of 1931, forcing West to become a day boy at Cranbrook until he gained a scholarship. Possibly the financial insecurity of that time influenced West's later exhausting employment schedule and his reluctance to turn down assignments. He claimed to have worked for every department of the BBC except drama. Sometimes he took on too much. He failed to pull his weight in an insurance broking venture with his friend John Newman. Another venture was more successful, though again his partner was the more active. In 1971, with the advertising entrepreneur Patrick Nally, he set up a sports public relations group, the West Nally Group, which focused on organizations rather than individual sportspeople. West, as congenial chairman, was instrumental in persuading Benson and Hedges to sponsor a new one-day cricket competition, and Cornhill Insurance to sponsor test cricket. West resigned in 1983 to enjoy his garden and play bridge.<br>
<br>West's departure from <span class="italic">The Times</span> was less amicable when for the second time they refused to send him to cover a Lions' tour. His pique was one of the few documented instances of his schoolmaster's assessment continuing into maturity: &#145;Peter's character and temperament are of that mercurial type which must inevitably provoke storms&#146;  (West, 30). Generally he remained calm and never at a loss for words, the ideal anchorman in an era of live television when things could go wrong. Not everyone appreciated his television charm. He braved a hostile Yorkshire crowd after criticizing the cricket captain Brian Close; the tennis star Jimmy Connors once refused to be interviewed by him; and Scottish <span class="italic">Come Dancing</span> fans always felt he was biased against their team.<br>
<br>West retained what he conceded were old-fashioned ideals of sportsmanship, in which the referee's decision was accepted, rugby players were not paid, stubble-faced cricketers were anathema, and poor standards of courtesy ought to be condemned. He was particularly irritated that on several occasions his contracts with the BBC were not renewed, without a letter of thanks for past efforts. His final years were clouded by the onset of prostate cancer, from which he died at his home, 55 Priory Close, Combe Down, Bath, on 2 September 2003. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
