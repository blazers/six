<span class="headword">Maynwaring,  Arthur</span>  (1668&#150;1712), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born at Ightfield, Shropshire on 9 July 1668, the son of Charles Maynwaring (<i>bap</i>. 1636, <i>d</i>. 1690) and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1702), a daughter of Charles Cholmondeley. After attending grammar school in Shrewsbury he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1683, but left before graduating. From Oxford he went to Cheshire, where he spent several years with his maternal uncle Francis Chomley, and visited regularly another relative, Sir Philip Egerton. Both men were nonjurors, and in his early years he followed their views, extolling the tories in his earliest satires in 1689. <span class="italic">Tarquin and Tullia</span> was attributed to John Dryden, but Dryden revealed the true author, which gave Maynwaring early celebrity. From Cheshire he went to his parents' lodgings in Essex Street, London, while he studied law at the Inner Temple. Through the earl of Cholmondeley he became acquainted with the leading whig grandees and gradually converted to their political principles. Through Dryden he became acquainted with William Congreve, whose play <span class="italic">The Double-Dealer</span> he edited and revised (1693). He quickly developed a reputation as a critic and wit. About 1700 his whig and literary credentials earned him entry into the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>, and he became one of its chief ornaments. His father died in 1690 leaving his estate heavily encumbered. Maynwaring raised some &pound;4000 upon it and lived for a time as a man of fashion, travelling to Paris in 1697 after the treaty of Ryswick, where he met Boileau and La Fontaine. On 18 November 1701, through the intercession of Charles, Lord Halifax, he was appointed a commissioner of the customs, where he distinguished himself by his ability and probity.<br>
<br>Not long after the accession of Queen Anne, Maynwaring met Anne Oldfield (1683&#150;1730) through a fellow Kit-Cat member, John Vanbrugh, who had discovered her dramatic talents. Oldfield, who first went on the stage at the age of sixteen, was barely twenty when Maynwaring became her admirer and then lover. Her later success was attributed by her anonymous biographer to his grooming and teaching. Her career also prompted Maynwaring to write more than a dozen epilogues and prologues to be spoken by her. In 1703 he was credited with writing <span class="italic">The Golden Age Restored</span>, which was actually by his friend William Walsh. It nearly cost him his place when the tory secretary of state, the earl of Nottingham, complained to Lord Treasurer Godolphin. Godolphin, respecting Maynwaring's ability and integrity, assured him he could keep his place but found him a better one: in May 1705 the treasurer purchased for Maynwaring the office of an auditor of the imprests, an accounting office in the exchequer, which he retained until his death. Befitting his new eminence, at the end of 1706 he was elected in a by-election to parliament for Preston and was re-elected in 1708. He lost his seat in the tory landslide of 1710 but was returned for West Looe, a seat controlled by Bishop Trelawny, for which he sat until his death.<br>
<br>By 1704 Maynwaring had begun writing whig attacks on the tories, although only one, a poem, <span class="italic">The History and Fall of the <span class="roman">[</span>Occasional<span class="roman">]</span> Conformity Bill</span> (1704), has been identified in print. At some stage in the early years of the century he was admitted into the circle of friends of Sarah, duchess of Marlborough. It may have been in the summer of 1704, which he spent with Anne Oldfield at Windsor; the duchess was ranger of Windsor Great Park and the lodge there her favourite residence. Over the next several years Maynwaring became her confidante and aide, and was eventually rewarded with the title of her secretary. The earliest surviving letter from Maynwaring to the duchess dates only from 4 September 1707, but thereafter more than 200 survive, including a few from her, that continue right up until his death. The duchess, for several decades Queen Anne's closest friend, had isolated herself from the court after the death of her only surviving son in 1703. Moreover, her outspoken championing of the whigs gradually estranged her from the tory-inclined sovereign and led by 1707 to a complete alienation. The whig leaders assumed she could influence the queen in their favour, not recognizing the growing bitterness between the two women. Maynwaring gradually entered into an ever more critical relationship with the duchess, who depended upon him and his friends for companionship and entertainment. He encouraged her to lobby for the whigs with the duke of Marlborough and Godolphin, and drafted letters for her to send to the queen and even to her husband.<br>
<br>In 1708 Maynwaring's writings began to take a more serious turn. His <span class="italic">Advice to the Electors of Great Britain</span>, written in conjunction with the duchess, was highly successful; no other tract survives for that year. He was indifferent to literary success, and much of his earlier material probably circulated only in manuscript. But the political crises of 1710 turned him from an occasional writer into a dedicated pamphleteer and propagandist. The queen resented the importunities of the whig leaders and their insistence on a growing presence in the ministry. At the impeachment of Dr Henry Sacheverell, a high-flying tory cleric, the strong show of public support for Sacheverell, and the growing disenchantment with the government for the long-drawn-out and expensive war with France, emboldened the queen, acting on the advice of Robert Harley and his confederates, to begin turning out the whigs. The dismissals became a rout, capped by the removal of Godolphin in August and the dissolution of parliament in September. Maynwaring gradually assumed the role of director of the press for the whigs and devoted the remaining two years of his life to defending their policies and those of Marlborough and leading the attack on the now dominant tories led by Harley.<br>
<br>Maynwaring's first important effort was <span class="italic">Four Letters to a Friend in North Britain</span>. Appearing in August 1710, it branded the high-church party with Jacobitism and popery. It was followed by <span class="italic">A letter from Monsieur Pett<span class="roman">[</span>ecu<span class="roman">]</span>&#151;to Monsieur B<span class="roman">[</span>uy<span class="roman">]</span>s</span>, which warned against a change of the ministry as it would lead to Marlborough's resignation and a decline in support for the war. The latter tract was the focus of the first three issues of a new ministerial organ, <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, soon to be directed by Jonathan Swift. Maynwaring rebutted by starting first the <span class="italic">Whig Examiner</span>, written by Joseph Addison, and, when that proved ineffectual, recruiting John Oldmixon to produce <span class="italic">The Medley</span>, much of which was written by Maynwaring. A flood of poems, broadsides, tracts, and books followed. It is impossible to identify all his handiwork, but Oldmixon, who had possession of his papers after his death, is the best authority in his <span class="italic">The Life and Posthumous Works of Arthur Maynwaring</span> (1715). <span class="italic">The Medley</span> succeeded in fulfilling his aim, for <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> suspended publication in July 1711, prompting Maynwaring to terminate <span class="italic">The Medley</span> soon afterwards. Towards the end of the year illness brought on by the consumption from which he had suffered for over a decade sapped his energies. Somehow he was able to edit two sets of tracts by Francis Hare, Marlborough's chaplain-general, who had accompanied the duke on his marches since 1704 and was privy to his thoughts. Four <span class="italic">Letters on the Management of the War</span> appeared during the winter of 1711&#150;12, followed by a second set of four, <span class="italic">The Allies and the Late Ministry Defended</span>. In late 1711 the government made a sweep of the opposition press, incarcerating fourteen printers and publishers for seditious writing. Maynwaring had close connections with virtually every one, and he had no doubt that he was a principal target in the government's efforts to stamp out its opponents. Indeed, he was so informed, directly and indirectly by Harley, now lord treasurer and earl of Oxford. Several vindications and defences of Marlborough written by Hare or Maynwaring himself appeared early in 1712. Maynwaring answered Swift's <span class="italic">British Academy</span>; he wrote a statement of the conditions behind the controverted election in Bewdley.<br>
<br>After Marlborough was cashiered by Oxford at the end of 1711, the duke, fearing for his life, contemplated exile, and the death of Godolphin on 15 September 1712 only confirmed him in his decision. Maynwaring, now gravely ill, performed one last service for the Marlboroughs, interceding with Oxford for passes to permit them to go abroad. His petition was successful and the duke, to be followed by the duchess, departed on 28 November, shortly after Maynwaring's death in London on 13 November 1712. He was buried with his forebears at Chertsey, Surrey. Owing to the heavy debts of his father, which he had been repaying, and his own lack of attention to money matters until late in his life, his estate was small. What remained was divided between a sister, Grizel, and Anne Oldfield, who used it to bring up their son, Arthur.<br>
<br>Although his production was small, Maynwaring's influence among both politicians and writers was great. He befriended and promoted Congreve, Richard Steele, Robert Walpole, and a host of actors, writers, and minor politicians. He was part of the inner circle of the Godolphin ministry, and his influence with the duchess was extraordinary. It was largely Maynwaring who persuaded her to remain in office until she was forced to resign at the end of 1710. The draft biography and apologia of Marlborough he was working on at the time of his death was turned over, along with his correspondence and literary remains, to Steele by the duchess after his death. Steele completed the draft, coupled it with a life of Prince Eugene, and published it in 1714 as <span class="italic">The Lives of Two Illustrious Generals</span>. Maynwaring was an accomplished classicist (the catalogue for the auction of his books in 1713 testifies to his love of the classics and the breadth of his knowledge), a poet, a musician who sang and accompanied himself at the harpsichord, and a famous wit and conversationalist. But he was also a devoted lover, friend, and patron of men of letters and the stage.<br>
