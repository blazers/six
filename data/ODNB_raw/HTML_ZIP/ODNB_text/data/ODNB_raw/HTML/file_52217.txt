<span class="headword">Romeyn,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1313), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was a man of unknown and apparently alien origins, remarkable for the ease with which he entered and rose within London's governing mercantile class. Another man called Romain, a citizen of Lucca, appears in London in 1305, but it is not known whether Thomas was a native or Italian-born. He became a citizen before 1280, was elected sheriff in 1290, alderman in 1294, and mayor in 1309. His career shows that London was not governed by such a closed &#145;patriciate&#146; of established families as some historians have claimed, before Edward I forced the city in 1285 to admit aliens of good repute to the citizenship. Rather it demonstrates that Londoners were ready, on certain conditions, to welcome the alien merchants who were so important to the city's growing trade. They had particular reason to do this from 1280 onwards, when Romeyn first appears in the records as a citizen and pepperer purchasing a shop in the pepperers' trading quarter of Sopers Lane. Flemish merchants were that year expelled from England, and the Italians who took their place as the chief wool exporters began increasing their imports of spices and other luxuries in order to pay for their wool. Only London was capable of providing a rich enough market for these imports and its citizens became their chief distributors to the provinces. By this means London was able to increase its trade at the expense of the east-coast ports and the fairs which had been used by the Flemings. Hence such men as &#145;le Roman&#146;, as his name is once spelt, and his Proven&ccedil;al associates were welcomed by London's pepperers, even though they competed in their retail and distributive trade.<br>
<br>Romeyn sold spices in London to members of the nobility, such as Bogo de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1294), and to Westminster Abbey, which on various occasions owed him substantial sums, not only for spices, but also for cloth and furs. He also supplied Durham, and probably other provincial abbeys, and no doubt bought wool from them in return to sell to alien merchants in London, although there is no evidence that he himself exported it. He ran a hostel for alien merchants in St Mary Aldermary's parish, where he lived, and later he built a chapel dedicated to St Thomas in the parish church. He invested steadily in shops and houses in London and its environs, and in 1292 he was one of the top taxpayers in the city. In the previous year he served as sheriff with the pepperer, William Layer, and they antagonized London's brewers by their rigour in fining recalcitrant taxpayers. Their election as aldermen during that decade symbolized the economic and political advancement of the pepperers, which had been achieved through their co-operation with the Italians and Proven&ccedil;als who imported their goods and gave them credit. However, other Londoners resented the aliens' advancement, and as the economy slumped in the later 1290s because of the king's export of coin to finance his French war, the aldermen had to deal with violent protests and verbal abuse; Romeyn and his wife, Julia or Juliana, suffered from one such attack, by an armourer, in their house in 1298.<br>
<br>Romeyn's greatest service to London was his skilful leadership in the political crisis which dominated his mayoralty in 1309&#150;10. The barons' opposition to Edward II's favourite, Piers Gaveston, was on the point of bringing the kingdom to civil war, in which both sides strove to command the economic and strategic advantages of London. The king put pressure on the city in November 1309 to hand over the profits of the weighing beams to his favourites. Romeyn resisted these demands, but, fearful that the king would take over the city's government, he strove to avoid any excuse for royal interference. He redressed the grievances of alien merchants over the Londoners' manner of weighing, and preserved order in the city in a harsh winter when food was very short. He thus held the rival parties in check until the ordainers had established their power over the royal government. Under his leadership the Londoners then won from the ordainers the great concession of annulling the <span class="italic">Carta mercatoria</span> of 1303, by which Edward I had granted the aliens special liberties in return for higher taxes.<br>
<br>Romeyn died on 25 March 1313, bequeathing much of his property to his wife, and on her death to the chantries he had established in several churches including St Mary Aldermary and St Thomas the Apostle, in churches at Clapham and Lambeth where he held land, and at Waltham. Two of his daughters were nuns at Holywell, one married a London shoemaker, and the fourth, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56287/', "Roesia (Rose) Burford")</script>, married Romeyn's fellow pepperer, John Burford, a rich wool exporter who was also to be an alderman. Romeyn's wife, whom he had married by 1285, died in 1326. They had no surviving male issue.<br>
