<span class="headword">Craig,  William James</span>  (1843&#150;1906), <span class="occ">literary editor and university teacher</span>, was born on 6 November 1843 at Camus-juxta-Bann, also known as Macosquin, co. Londonderry, the second son of George Craig (1800&#150;1888) and his wife, Mary Catherine Sandys (1803&#150;1879). His father was curate of Camus-juxta-Bann and later rector of Aghanloo, co. Londonderry. William Craig was educated at Portora School, Enniskillen, and admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, on 1 July 1861; he received his BA degree in 1865, with honours, and that of MA in 1870. At Trinity College he met and became the lifelong friend of Edward Dowden.<br>
<br>After a stint of tutoring in history and literature at Trinity, Craig migrated in 1874 to London, where he tutored for the army and civil service. Two years later he became professor of English language and literature at University College, Aberystwyth, where he organized a reading class in Shakespeare. He resigned from the position in 1879, but not without having instilled a love of literature in a number of his students. He returned to tutoring, eventually giving it up in 1898; some of those he tutored were later to become men of some prominence, for instance Lord Hugh Cecil, youngest son of the marquess of Salisbury, whom he taught in 1884. After retiring from teaching he devoted himself to reading, research, and publication in the area of Shakespeare studies. As early as 1883, however, he had published a collation of the folio texts of <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> for the New Shakspere Society. Some ten years later, in 1894, he edited the complete works of Shakespeare in one volume with a brief glossary and an appended &#145;Index of characters&#146; as well as an &#145;Index of first lines of songs, etc.&#146;. As it was published by the Clarendon Press of Oxford, it became known as the <span class="roman">Oxford Shakespeare</span>.<br>
<br>The brief glossary appended to the <span class="roman">Oxford Shakespeare</span> was to be augmented by Craig into a comprehensive glossary, a project on which he was working when he died. Unfortunately, the materials which he left for this glossary were in such a state as to preclude posthumous publication. He did, however, edit the so-called &#145;Little Quarto Shakespeare&#146; in forty volumes, completed two years before he died. The scholarly paraphernalia consists of an introduction to each of the plays and footnotes. For a brief period, from 1901 to his death five years later, he succeeded his friend Edward Dowden as general editor of the <span class="roman">Arden Shakespeare</span>, which also ran to forty volumes edited by various scholars. He himself edited <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and was at work editing <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> at the time of his death, and the modern editor of the Arden <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> (1976), Philip Brockbank, acknowledges having &#145;assimilated much from the 1922 Arden edition by W. J. Craig and R. H. Case&#146;  (Brockbank, ix). Dowden edited <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, making early reference to Craig's collation of the folio texts of the play and to his theories on the matter of possible sources of the story. Dowden also acknowledged that Craig &#145;With great generosity &hellip; placed a large body of his manuscript notes at my disposal, and gave me many later additions to this mass of annotations&#146;  (Dowden, xlii). A number of these are recorded in Dowden's own footnotes.<br>
<br>Contemporaries state that Craig was a tireless long-distance walker and a gregarious person. He died, a confirmed bachelor, in a nursing home at 12 Beaumont Street, London, on 12 December 1906 and was buried in Reigate churchyard. A number of volumes from his library are, fittingly, in the public library at Stratford upon Avon, donated by his sister Mrs Merrick Head.<br>
