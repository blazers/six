<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  James</span>  (1808&#150;1881), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 3 March 1808, was the son of Rear-Admiral Sir George Johnstone Hope (1767&#150;1818), who as a captain commanded the <i>Defence</i> at Trafalgar, and his first wife, Lady Jemima Hope Johnstone, fifth daughter of James Hope Johnstone, third earl of Hopetoun. Admiral Sir Henry Hope (1787&#150;1863) was James Hope's first cousin. In August 1820 Hope entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and in June 1822 was appointed to the frigate <i>Forte</i> going out to the West Indies; afterwards he served in the <i>Cambrian</i> in the Mediterranean and was promoted lieutenant on 9 March 1827. On 16 September he was appointed to the <i>Maidstone</i>, but a fortnight later was transferred to the <i>Undaunted</i>, which carried Lord William Bentinck out to India as governor-general. In August 1829 Hope was appointed flag lieutenant to the earl of Northesk, then commander-in-chief at Plymouth, and on 26 February 1830 he was promoted commander. From 1833 to 1838 he commanded the <i>Racer</i> on the North America and West Indies station and was posted on 28 June 1838. On 16 August 1838 he married the Hon. Frederica Kinnaird, daughter of Charles Kinnaird, eighth Lord Kinnaird; the couple had no children. In December 1844 he commissioned the steam frigate <i>Firebrand</i> for service on the South American station, and on 20 November 1845 played a prominent part in the engagement with the batteries at Obligado on the River Parana in Argentina. Hope was nominated a CB on 3 April 1846. During the Crimean War from 1854 to 1856 he commanded the <i>Majestic</i> in the Baltic, but without opportunity of personal distinction. On 19 November 1857 he attained the rank of rear-admiral. In March 1859 he was appointed commander-in-chief in China and on 16 April reached Singapore, where he relieved Sir Michael Seymour.<br>
<br>The Second Opium War had formally ended in a treaty signed at Tientsin (Tianjin) on 26 June 1858, the ratifications of which were to be exchanged at Peking (Beijing) within a year. It was, however, rumoured at Shanghai that the British and French ministers would not be permitted to go to Peking. On 17 June 1859 the <i>Chesapeake</i>, flying Hope's flag, anchored in the Po Hai (Bohai), and Hope went at once in the gunboat <i>Plover</i> to the mouth of the Peiho (Beihe) to inform the governor of the forts of the ambassadors' approach and to see for himself what the passage was like. He found that it was blocked and the forts guarding it strengthened. On 19 June the allied ministers arrived off the bar of the Peiho, but as the obstructions prevented their passing up the river, and they were told to go to the Pehtang (Beitang), 9 miles further north, contrary as they thought to the terms of the treaty, they formally requested Hope to clear the way for them. This accordingly he undertook to do, and on 25 June he attempted, and failed, to force the passage. The Chinese defended resolutely. Three British ships were sunk and more disabled; 89 men were killed and 345 wounded, including Hope, who was seriously injured. It was a significant rebuff to British arms.<br>
<br>This repulse of British forces gave rise to the allegation that they were treacherously attacked, and that the guns were manned by Europeans&#151;Russians more especially&#151;or Americans. Such allegations were unfounded: for even admitting that the attack was a violation of the treaty, it was understood by Hope that the treaty was to be violated; and he approached the boom knowing that he would have to fight his way. The passage which Hope tried to force had been forced by Seymour only the year before; and it had often been pointed out that to attack the Chinese forces twice in the same way on the same ground was likely to lead to serious fighting. Despite the tactical error, which led the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, to doubt his suitability for such a high command, Hope's exploits aroused great popular enthusiasm in Britain. It was decided that the treaty must be ratified at Peking, and a strong military expedition was sent out by the allied powers. Hope had meantime gone to the vicinity of Ningpo (Ningbo), where he remained to revive his health. In 1860 he oversaw local transport arrangements, and by the end of June the troops were landed at the mouth of the Pehtang. By 1 August all was ready for the advance. On 20 September they attacked and stormed the fort on the north side of the Peiho. When that was captured the southern forts were at once evacuated, the obstacles were removed from the mouth of the river, and on the 23rd Hope went up to Tientsin, where he for the most part remained until the treaty was signed at Peking on 24 October. On 9 November 1860 he was nominated a KCB and in the following year received the grand cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In the spring of 1862 he co-operated with the Chinese imperial troops under Ward, the American general, in driving back the Taipings from the areas near Shanghai and Ningpo. Several of their positions were taken by storm, and on different occasions there was severe though irregular fighting during which Hope was wounded by a musket shot. The situation was still very unsettled when, in the autumn, he was relieved by Rear-Admiral Kuper.<br>
<br>Despite reservations about his diplomatic skills, towards the end of 1863 Hope was appointed commander-in-chief in North America and the West Indies, where the American Civil War was still raging. His command there was uneventful. He became vice-admiral on 16 September 1864, GCB on 28 March 1865, and returned to England in spring 1867. From 1869 to 1872 he was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth and was thus, in October 1870, called on to preside at the court martial which inquired into the loss of the <i>Captain</i>. He became admiral on 21 January 1870; was appointed principal aide-de-camp in February 1873; was retired, on reaching seventy, in March 1878; and on 15 June 1879 was advanced to the honorary rank of admiral of the fleet. In 1877 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Reid Cotton, daughter of General Sir A. Cotton; she survived him. During his later years his health was poor, and he lived in comparative retirement. He died, childless, at his home, Carriden House, Bo'ness, Linlithgowshire, on 9 June 1881. Hope was an officer of great personal courage but lacked the intellectual and diplomatic skills required for high command.<br>
