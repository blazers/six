<span class="headword">Baker,  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in July 1612 and graduated BA in 1616. Ordained priest on 14 November 1618 in the diocese of Norwich he proceeded MA the following year. In January 1626 he was presented to the rectory of St Margaret Pattens, London, and in 1627 he proceeded BD. It is possible that he married at St James's, Duke's Place, on 22 May 1632, but the bride's name is unknown. If true it is also possible that the marriage was not to Joan, recorded as his wife in the 1640s, and that it did not last long, for in 1633 Baker was appointed household chaplain to William Juxon, bishop of London. One of his duties in this capacity was to license books for the press, and it was later alleged that a number of theological books licensed by Baker, including William Jones's <span class="italic">Commentary upon the Epistles to Philemon and to the Hebrewes</span> (1635) and Richard Clerke's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1637), had been heavily censored to make them appear less anti-Catholic. The clerical convert Richard Carpenter, who had defected to the Church of Rome but subsequently returned to the Church of England, complained that Baker had permitted him to preach at Paul's Cross only on condition that he did not speak &#145;revengefully and ungratefully against the church of Rome, as having had my breeding from them&#146;, and that he attributed his conversion to &#145;the sight and love of the orders and ceremonies newly begun in the church of England, a thing which (the Lord knowes) had not entred into my thoughts before this admonishment&#146;  (Kent Archives Office, U350 C2/53). Carpenter also complained that when he submitted his sermon for licensing, &#145;Mr Baker answered by noe meanes, and gave this reason, because now the Church of Rome and we were in a faire and quiet way, and it was not fitt to multiply Controversies&#146;  (Kent Archives Office, U350 Q5).<br>
<br>Baker was generously rewarded with ecclesiastical preferment. In June 1636 he became minister of St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, in October he was collated to a prebendal stall in St Paul's, London, and in July 1637 he resigned St Margaret Pattens to become rector of St Mary-at-Hill. In August 1638 he was appointed a canon of Windsor, resigning in May 1639 to become a canon of Canterbury; that year he proceeded DD. He may have been the Samuel Baker who married Joan Bray at Canterbury on 25 June 1642. On 15 January 1640 he had been appointed a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. In April he resigned St Christopher-le-Stocks to become rector of South Weald, Essex. He kept St Mary-at-Hill, but in June his dispensation to hold it in plurality was found to be legally invalid. However, he was unanimously reappointed to St Mary by the trustees (acting on behalf of the parishioners), and remained in possession of both until the civil war. None the less, his rapid promotion provoked some adverse comment: one hostile account later claimed that &#145;Baker, the Bishop of London's chaplaine, being one morning desired to present a Petition from a Minister to his Lord for a Prebend's place, carried the matter so craftily, that he had it for himselfe&#146;. According to the same account &#145;this Baker was so over-joyed with the death of some good Divines, and the going away of others, that he made verses of them, and the same day hee made them hee broke his legge&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scots Scouts Discoveries</span>, E1<i>v</i>). While the reliability of these stories is dubious it is clear that Baker was widely regarded as an enemy of the puritan clergy and a loyal servant of the Laudian regime. Sir Edward Dering remarked in his <span class="italic">Discourse of Proper Sacrifice</span> (1644) that he had always regarded Baker as more extreme in his views than his fellow licenser William Bray.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1643 the House of Commons ordered Baker to be sequestrated from the living of South Weald on the grounds that &#145;he hath indeavoured to corrupt his People at such times as he hath preached there with the leaven of Popish doctrine&#146;; that &#145;he beleeved not the Pope to be Anti-Christ, because his Mother the Church whom he would not outrun had not yet revealed it&#146;; that he had licensed &#145;divers Popish Bookes pleading for Auricular Confession and other points of Popery&#146;; that he had bowed to the altar when administering the sacrament, and had knelt down on the altar steps &#145;with his hands lift up&#146;; and that he had &#145;expressed ill affection to the Parliament&#146;  (Parl. Arch., Main MSS). On 16 May the House of Lords confirmed the order of the Commons, despite a personal appearance by Baker to confess that he had two livings and two prebendaries and &#145;hath had some Misfortune in licensing Books, which he is sorry for&#146;. On 26 May the committee for sequestrations ordered the seizure of Baker's house and goods, valued at &pound;80 12<i>s</i>., and on 27 July the Commons ordered Baker to be sequestrated from the living of St Mary-at-Hill, although his wife, Joan, was later granted one-fifth of the living by the committee for plundered ministers. On 19 June 1647 the parishioners of St Michael Royal, London, petitioned the committee to appoint Baker as their minister. The petition was rejected, but Baker was brought in &#145;by force and in a tumultuous waie&#146; by a group of parishioners, and the committee finally referred the matter to the parish vestry to settle among themselves  (Liu, 137, citing BL, Add. MS 15671, fols. 59, 87).<br>
<br>Baker is said to have assisted Brian Walton in the preparation of the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>; and when Walton borrowed the <span class="roman">Codex Alexandrinus</span> in 1653, Baker was one of the five persons who stood surety for its safe return. On 16 March 1658 the vestry of St Mary-at-Hill granted Baker &pound;10 out of the parish funds &#145;for his releefe in his great necessitie and sicknes&#146;, and he must have died before 25 May 1658, when the vestry minutes recorded that the living was vacant  (Guildhall Library, MS 1240/1).<br>
