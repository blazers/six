<span class="headword">Doherty,  John</span>  (1783&#150;1850), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of John Doherty of Dublin. He was educated at Chester School in England and later at Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained his BA in 1806 and his LLD in 1814. He was called to the Irish bar in 1808 and joined the Leinster circuit; he took silk in 1823. His progress at the bar was slow, but he was known for his wit and powers of oratory.<br>
<br>From 1824 to 1826 Doherty was the elected MP for New Ross, co. Wexford. In 1826 connections with the Bushe family and with George Canning, then premier, aided his return for Kilkenny as a liberal tory. He became solicitor-general on 18 June 1827, during Canning's administration, and was re-elected for Kilkenny. In 1828 he was elected a bencher of the King's Inns, Dublin; from July to December 1830 he was MP for Newport, Cornwall; and on 23 December 1830 he was appointed lord chief justice of the common pleas, with a seat in the privy council, on the promotion of Lord Plunket to the lord chancellorship of Ireland.<br>
<br>Although a committed protestant, Doherty supported Catholic emancipation and is better remembered for his political activity than for his career as a judge. He was one of Peel's chief advisers on Irish policy and impressed the house with his fluency on both Irish matters and policy in general. As solicitor-general he had led the prosecution in a case of conspiracy to murder, &#145;the Doneraile conspiracy&#146;, debated in the house on 15 May 1830. Daniel O'Connell represented the Catholic defendants and later in the house raised charges of impropriety against Doherty in relation to the conduct of the case. In refuting O'Connell's charges, Doherty won fame for his oratory as well as winning the case.<br>
<br>In 1834 Sir Robert Peel asked Doherty to retire from the judicial bench, with the view of resuming his position in parliament. However, Doherty refused, stating that he had left politics behind upon his ascension to the bench. He was a commissioner for education and lost a large fortune through railway speculation. He retired to Beaumaris, north Wales, and died from heart disease on 8 September 1850. He left a widow, Elizabeth Lucy Doherty, formerly Wall, and several children. He was buried at St Kevin's churchyard, Dublin. A portrait of Doherty by Martin Cregan was acquired by the National Gallery of Ireland and an anonymous print was obtained by the National Portrait Gallery, London.<br>
