<span class="headword">Banks,  William <span class="st"> [Richard]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1591&#150;1637), <span class="occ">showman</span>, the exhibitor of a famous performing horse called Morocco or Marocco, is hard to identify precisely. This is perhaps because of the kind of cultural phenomenon the horse and his trainer represent. It is the horse's activities that are described in detail in the literature of Banks's day. Banks, who may have been a native of Staffordshire, becomes the shadowy figure behind the performance, as an epigram in Thomas Bastard's <span class="italic">Chrestoleros</span> (1598) makes clear: &#145;B<i>ankes</i> hath a horse of wondrous qualitie, For he can fight, and pisse, and daunce, and lie. And finde your purse, and tell what coyne ye have. <i>But</i> <i>Bankes</i>, who taught your horse to smel a knave?&#146;  (p. 62).<br>
<br>Banks's first recorded appearance with a horse was in Shrewsbury in 1591. According to <span class="italic">Tarlton's Jests</span> (1611), Banks originally served the earl of Essex, exhibiting his horse &#145;of strange qualities &hellip; at the Crosse Keyes in Gracious-streete&#146;  (Hazlitt, 217). He may be identified with William Banks, a vintner in Cheapside, London, in later years, who is said to have &#145;taught his Horse to dance, and shooed him with Silver&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life and Death of Mrs. Mary Frith</span>, 1662, 75). This William Banks achieved his vintner status not through the company but by special royal licence from the king. In a record of May 1637, a mock bill of fare is preserved &#145;sent to Bankes the Vintner in Cheapside&#146;. It itemizes delicacies from the animal kingdom such as &#145;a rhinoceros boyled in alligant; sixe tame lyons in greene sawce; a whole horse sowced after the Russian fashion&#146; (Halliwell-Phillipps, 52; MS Ashmole 826). Mention is made of &#145;mine host Bankes&#146; in James Shirley's <span class="italic">The Ball</span> as late as 1639  (H4<i>v</i>), which seems to support the celebratory horse trainer-turned-vintner idea. In German records of performances of the horse, however, the owner is named &#145;Reichardt [Richard] Banckes&#146; rather than William  (Schrickx, 138).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Tarlton's Jests</span> tells of the horse's ability to single out persons named by his master, as does Richard Braithwaite's <span class="italic">Strappado for the Divell</span> (1615). Marocco's talent for counting out money is mentioned by Shakespeare in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> (1594&#150;5?), by Joseph Hall in his <span class="italic">Virgidemiarvm &hellip; of Byting Satyres</span> (1598), and by Sir Kenelm Digby in <span class="italic">The Nature of Bodies</span> (1644).<br>
<br>At the end of 1595 a pamphlet was published called <span class="italic">Maroccus extaticus</span>, &#145;or Bankes Bay Horse in a Trance, a discourse set downe in a merry dialogue between Bankes and his beast, anatomizing some abuses and bad trickes of this age&#146;. A woodcut included with the dialogue represents Banks in the act of opening his entertainment, the horse standing on his hind legs with a stick in his mouth, and there are dice on the ground. From the title-page it appears that Banks was then showing his horse at the Belsavage inn without Ludgate. About 1600 the horse was said to have performed his most famous feat&#151;that of climbing to the top of St Paul's Cathedral. In <span class="italic">The Owles Almanacke</span> entry for 1617 (by &#145;Iocundary Merrie-braines&#146;, published 1618) it is stated that &#145;since the dancing horse stood on the top of Powles, whilst a number of asses stood braying, below&#151;17 [years]&#146;  (p. 7). References to the event are to be found in many of Thomas Dekker's plays and tracts, in William Rowley's <span class="italic">A Search for Money</span> (1609), and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1601 Banks exhibited his horse at Paris, and the best account of Morocco's feats is given by a French eyewitness, Jean de Montlyard, in a note to a translation of <span class="italic">The Golden Ass</span> by Apuleius (<span class="italic">Les metamorphoses, ou, L'asne d'or</span>, 1602). According to this text a magistrate of Paris had suspected that his tricks were performed by magic, and for some time Banks was imprisoned and his horse impounded. When Banks demonstrated how he had instructed Morocco by signs, they were both released, and Banks was permitted to continue his performances. At Orl&eacute;ans, according to Thomas Morton, Morocco was again suspected of being a pupil of the devil. Banks, to counter the suspicion, &#145;commanded his horse to seeke out one in the preasse of the people who had a crucifixe on his hat&#146;. This done, he &#145;bad him kneele downe unto it, &amp; not this onely, but also to rise up againe and to kisse it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Direct Answer unto the Scandalous Exceptions of Theophilus Higgons</span>, 1609, 11). The same account describes how man and horse visited Frankfurt shortly after this adventure. More recent research has found records of performances before Henry Julius, duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, in April 1605, and this is where the name Reichardt is recorded.<br>
<br>Texts like Gervase Markham's <span class="italic">Cavelarice</span> (1607) continued to refer to Banks's tricks with his horse when the original Morocco would have been too old to perform, and was probably dead or retired. Playful allusions in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Epigrams</span> (1616) and in a marginal note to the mock romance of <span class="italic">Don Zara del Fogo</span>, by Basilius Musophilus, killed off horse and trainer by having them both burnt at Rome &#145;by the commandment of the pope&#146;  (Basilius Musophilus, <span class="italic">Don Zara del Fogo</span>, 1656, 114).<br>
<br>If it is not known what happened to the bay gelding, something is known of what happened to Banks after his initial equine success. In 1608 Henry, prince of Wales, temporarily employed Banks as a horse trainer, as did the duke of Buckingham, according to records of 1622&#150;5. Curious allusions to Banks and his dancing horse are found in late publications written <i>c</i>.1635&#150;40 (William Davenant's &#145;The Long Vacation&#146; in <span class="italic">Wit and Drollery</span>, 1656, 84; and Thomas Killigrew's <span class="italic">The Parson's Wedding</span>, 1664, in <span class="italic">Comedies and Tragedies</span>, 86). An early Lancashire pedigree states that a &#145;daughter of &hellip; Banks, who kept the horse with the admirable tricks&#146;, married John Hyde of Urmeston, a member of an ancient county family  (Hunter).<br>
