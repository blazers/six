<span class="headword">Sherwood,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1622&#150;1634), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born in Norfolk. He entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 7 June 1622, and graduated BA in 1625/6. His tutor was Richard Sterne, who later assisted in Bishop Walton's polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1657), and became archbishop of York. Sherwood moved to London, established a school in St Sepulchre's churchyard, and compiled the English&#150;French dictionary that was appended to the second edition of Randle Cotgrave's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the French and English Tongues</span> (1632).<br>
<br>Sherwood was the first lexicographer to compile a word-list appearing in a bi-directional bilingual dictionary in which the English is set before the French. The work was entitled &#145;A dictionarie English and French; compiled for the commoditie of all such as are desirous of both the languages&#146; and was puffed as &#145;most copious&#146; on the title-page to Cotgrave's French&#150;English dictionary. His two prefaces were written with an eye to the different needs of both groups of target users. Sherwood apologizes to the English user for the space-saving restrictions imposed upon him by the printer, but makes a virtue of necessity:<blockquote>It could not be expected in so small a volume, as I was inforced to contract my selfe into, that (in this English Dictionarie) I should show all the French Nounes, and the conjugation of all French Verbes, which are most sufficiently and at large, alreadie done by M. Cotgrave; to whom I referre you.</blockquote>In his preface &#145;Aux favorables lecteurs fran&ccedil;ois, alemans, &amp; autres&#146; he is keen to stress the comprehensive nature of his word-list, which he claims contains all or most of the words in the English language, and the usefulness of the back-matter, which comprises a pronunciation guide and a list of irregular verbs. Sherwood's work was retained, with minor additions to the back-matter, in the editions of Cotgrave's dictionary that were revised and enlarged by James Howell (1650, 1660, 1673).<br>
<br>In 1634 Sherwood published <span class="italic">The French Tutour, &hellip; the Second Edition, Carefully Corrected and Enlarged</span>. It survives only in this text, though it was entered in the Stationers' register on 3 January 1625, and since no copy has been located, the existence of the first edition is open to question. The grammatical element of the work is largely derived from the revised 1625 edition of Charles Maupas's <span class="italic">Grammaire et syntaxe fran&ccedil;oise</span>  (Sherwood, iv). Only one additional fact about Sherwood survives: he was ordained deacon in Norwich on 23 December 1632.<br>
