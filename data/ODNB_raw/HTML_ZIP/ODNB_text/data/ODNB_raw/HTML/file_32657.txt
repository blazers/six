<span class="headword">Cubitt,  William George</span>  (1835&#150;1903), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Calcutta on 19 October 1835, the son of Major William Cubitt (1790&#150;1841) of the Bengal native infantry, fifth son of George Cubitt of Catfield, Norfolk. His mother was Harriet Harcourt. His sister Selena Fitzgerald married in 1859 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35419/', "Julian (afterwards Lord) Pauncefote")</script>. Educated privately at Latham, Yorkshire, he entered the Indian army as ensign in the 13th Bengal native infantry on 26 July 1853. He served against the Santal rebels in 1855.<br>
<br>Promoted lieutenant on 23 November 1856, Cubitt was at Lucknow in 1857 when his regiment mutinied. With the volunteer cavalry he was in the action of Chinhat near Lucknow on 30 June 1857, and was awarded the Victoria Cross for having on the retreat from Chinhat saved the lives of three men of the 32nd regiment. He was afterwards present throughout the defence of the residency at Lucknow. His gallant conduct was commended during the capture of the Tehri Koti on 25&#150;6 September and in a successful attack on a barricaded gateway held by the enemy on 12 November 1857, when he was wounded. He was awarded a year's extra service.<br>
<br>Cubitt married at Fort church, Calcutta, on 19 May 1863, Charlotte Isabella, second daughter of James Hills of Nishchintpur, Bengal, and sister of Lieutenant-General Sir James Hills-Johnes VC. She survived him with three sons and two daughters. The third son, Lewis, died of blood poisoning while assistant commissioner in Uganda, on 31 July 1911.<br>
<br>Cubitt, who was promoted captain on 26 July 1865 and major on 26 July 1873, served with the Duffla expedition on the north-west frontier in 1874&#150;5, when he was mentioned in dispatches. Promoted lieutenant-colonel on 26 July 1879, he was with the Khyber line force in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1880. He was promoted colonel on 26 July 1883, and was with the Akha expedition in 1883&#150;4, when he was mentioned in dispatches, and served in the continuation of the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1886&#150;7, when he was awarded the DSO. At the time of his retirement in 1892 he was in command of the 43rd Gurkhas (later the 8th Gurkha rifles).<br>
<br>Accomplished in outdoor games, especially racquets and cricket, Cubitt after retirement resided at Eastfield, Camberley, Surrey, where he died on 25 January 1903.<br>
