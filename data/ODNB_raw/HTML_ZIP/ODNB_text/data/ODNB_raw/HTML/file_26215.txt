<span class="headword">Stafford,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1533&#150;1557), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, was the ninth child but second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26205/', "Henry Stafford, tenth Baron Stafford (1501&#150;1563)")</script>, and Ursula Pole (<i>d</i>. 1570) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/75346">Stafford,  Ursula</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/22451">Pole,  Margaret</a>]. The courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69753/', "Dorothy Stafford")</script> was an elder sister. Two executed grandparents, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26202/', "Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham (d. 1521)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury (d. 1541)")</script>, transmitted royal descent from Thomas of Woodstock (<i>d</i>. 1397), the Beauforts, and the house of York. As a younger son, Thomas had no hereditary expectations and depended on favour from his family or from those with whom he sought to ingratiate himself. Repeatedly he concealed his cadetship, exploited and exaggerated his lineage, and laid claim to Buckingham's forfeited honours. He wanted advancement commensurate with his ancestry and &#145;named himself to be a lord&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1553&#150;8</i>, 276). Fantasy, deception, and pretexts are indistinguishable from any genuine beliefs or principles held by Stafford. Nothing is known of his education and he first occurs in 1550 as a protestant <i>en route</i> through Paris for Rome, where his uncle Reginald, Cardinal Pole, tried unsuccessfully to win him back to Catholicism; later Pole refused to recommend him to Mary. He spent three years in Italy and in 1553 proceeded to Poland, whence King Sigismund Augustus recommended him to Mary, reminded her of the Staffords' service to her mother, Katherine of Aragon, and requested his restoration to the dukedom of Buckingham.<br>
<br>When Stafford returned to England, however, he received no favours, and joined Wyatt's rebellion against the queen in January 1554, most probably the midland element led by Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk. Henceforth he was consistently hostile to the Spanish marriage. Briefly imprisoned in the Fleet, he fled to France, where he dishonestly claimed a role in opposing Suffolk, for which he was praised, but denounced the Spanish match to Cardinal Pole, who rebuffed him. He started intriguing with other English exiles, seeking in April 1554 to murder Sir William Pickering and engaging in violent quarrels with his own brother-in-law Sir Robert Stafford; each briefly imprisoned the other in 1556. &#145;If ever there were a <i>tragico comedia</i> played&#146;, the English ambassador observed, &#145;surely these men played it&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1553&#150;8</i>, 264). Although he was apparently irresponsible and incompetent, Mary's ministers feared Thomas Stafford's potential for causing trouble with the French, and placed a spy in his household who kept them informed and even supplied a map of his objective, although this was difficult to identify. Stafford's boasts, propaganda, and disinformation cloud his real intentions and resources. Leaving Dieppe on Easter Sunday (18 April 1557) with two ships and anything between 30 and 100 men, he seized the ill-protected Scarborough Castle on 25 April, titled himself &#145;The Lord Thomas Stafford, son to the Lord Henry, rightful Duke of Bokingham&#146;, and declared himself lord protector. He denounced the Spanish marriage, warned of an influx of Spaniards to enslave the people &#145;by the most develyshe devize of Mary, unrightful Quene of England&#146;, who was disqualified from ruling, and promised that the crown would revert &#145;to the trewe Inglyshe bloude of our owne naterall countrye&#146; and that the good laws of Henry VIII would be kept  (Strype, 3/2.515). Stafford called on the people to rise up, but failed to attract local recruits and on 28 April he himself, thirty-one companions (including four Scots), and the castle were captured by the earl of Westmorland. He was tried, condemned, and executed for treason at Tyburn on 28 May 1557, and later attainted; so were twenty-five followers.<br>
<br>The whole episode is mysterious and unexplained. It is unclear where Stafford found the resources for his expedition, why the notorious adventurer Jean Ribaud joined him, who were his financial backers, or what he hoped to achieve. When in France, Stafford claimed the English crown as next heir and assumed the royal arms without a difference: actions which, as a younger son with both parents living, he must have known were unfounded. It would not have been surprising if, as on previous occasions, the French had used a pretender to distract and restrain the English government; indeed Stafford claimed, and Mary's regime first feared and then believed, that he was financed by the French. In this case, however, historians are inclined to accept French denials. Henri II was too fearful of an English alliance with Spain against him, for which Stafford duly provided the justification. There is no indication either that Stafford was a figurehead for a more substantial dynastic claimant, or that the whole rebellion was merely a ploy by Mary's councillor Lord Paget to lure Stafford to destruction. Stafford himself had little recent knowledge of England, of warfare and rebellion, or of how to arouse popular support. Scarborough was not a place where the Staffords were strong. Stafford's rebellion may have been an attempt, albeit misguided, by a cadet to draw attention to himself and thus to secure a future. So absolutely did it fail that now, in retrospect, it looks completely unrealistic, and its purpose and potential cannot satisfactorily be assessed.<br>
