<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Jeannette Gaury</span>  (1841&#150;1886), <span class="occ">trade unionist and suffragist</span>, was born on 19 March 1841 at 40 Long Lane, Bermondsey, London, the daughter of George Henry Wilkinson, a foreman clerk in a large merchant's warehouse, and his wife Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lane). She had several brothers, one of whom was blind. Jeannette Wilkinson was educated at a private school in Queen Street, City of London, and from the age of seventeen earned her own living as an upholsteress.<br>
<br>Jeannette Wilkinson was determined to improve her education and attended evening classes at the Birkbeck Institute where she studied economics, history, and English literature. It was here that she became close friends with one of the tutors, J. H. Levy, who recalled that she was hampered in her scholastic achievements by poor handwriting which resulted from years of heavy upholstery work, in particular carpet sewing. He &#145;could not but admire the patience with which she fought against the stiffness her former occupation had induced in the joints of her fingers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women's Union Journal</span>, 83). Levy helped her to improve her handwriting and a string of prizes followed, including first prize of the Society of Arts for political economy in 1873.<br>
<br>In 1875 Jeannette Wilkinson became involved in the women's trade union movement. She was elected as secretary of the London Upholsteresses' Society which was affiliated to the Women's Protective and Provident League, an organization formed by Emma Paterson in 1874 to promote female trade unionism. Jeannette Wilkinson attended the Trades Union Congress nine times as a delegate from the society. Her speeches demonstrated a detailed, first-hand knowledge of women's work conditions and were well received, although her opposition to protective legislation for women, a view shared by other feminists within the league, was not acceptable to the majority of male delegates.<br>
<br>Jeannette Wilkinson had always been determined to be a schoolteacher. After passing the queen's scholar examination of the education department at Birkbeck she was helped by Helen Taylor, a member of the London school board, to gain a position as an assistant mistress. In 1876 she became a certificated teacher and a year later obtained employment in the Westcott Street board school at Southwark. Two years of teaching in a very poor neighbourhood, however, took its toll of Jeannette Wilkinson's health and she left Westcott Street to take up other teaching posts. These were only short-lived and by 1882 she was thinking of returning to her old trade when J. H. Levy found her a position as a clerk with the Vigilance Association for the Defence of Personal Rights. A secularist in religion and a radical individualist in politics, Jeannette Wilkinson agreed with the aims of the association, but in Levy's opinion she was not a very good clerk.<br>
<br>It was fortunate, therefore, that an opportunity soon arose for Jeannette Wilkinson to take up employment with the women's suffrage movement. She had long taken an interest in women's emancipation and the claim for the vote. In 1884 she was asked to support a resolution in favour of women's suffrage at a meeting at St James's Hall. She was an impressive speaker, &#145;saying what she wanted to say in short, pithy sentences, and never lulling her audience to sleep with musical platitudes. Every sentence was needed in the chain of logical argument&#146;  (Orme, 389&#150;90). On the strength of her speaking skills Jeannette Wilkinson was asked to become an organizing secretary and lecturer for the Bristol Society for Women's Suffrage where she worked closely with the secretary, Helen Blackburn. Early in 1885 she was transferred to London and helped to organize meetings in the area for the National Society for Women's Suffrage. In the same year she moved an amendment at the Trades Union Congress which called for the direct representation of women in parliament. Despite bitter opposition from a small group of delegates the amendment was supported by a majority of seventy to ten.<br>
<br>Jeannette Wilkinson firmly believed that women should have opinions on all the political questions of the day and her support for home rule for Ireland led her to join her local Liberal Association in 1885. She was elected to the executive council and during the general election campaign addressed numerous meetings in favour of Liberal candidates. During this period she continued to be active in the trade union movement, attending meetings of the Women's Trade Council, the Upholsteresses' Society, and the committee of the Women's Protective and Provident League. She also found time to write letters and short pieces for the <span class="italic">Women's Union Journal</span> and to complete an article for the <span class="italic">Charity Organisation Review</span> entitled &#145;The inspection of workshops in London&#146;.<br>
<br>Jeannette Wilkinson was one of a small minority of working-class women who became active as organizers and speakers in the trade union movement in the 1870s and 1880s and who also held strong feminist beliefs. As Helen Blackburn noted:<blockquote>instances of working men who have forged their way, through hard study, high up the ladder of achievement are frequent &hellip; but the instances in which women have done so are comparatively rare. Jeannette Gaury Wilkinson was one of these &hellip; Truly of her it might be said, &#145;She loved her fellow-<i>women</i>&#146;. (Blackburn, 166)</blockquote>Jeannette Wilkinson was always earnest in promoting reforms, but was judicious in her treatment of opponents who, even when they disagreed with her views, appreciated the accuracy of her statements and her open-mindedness.<blockquote>Her manner was pleasant and cheery at all times. Her small body never seemed strong enough for the tasks she set it to do, but the bright eye and determined mouth showed where the strength came from to supply physical deficiencies. (Orme, 389)</blockquote>Ill health cut short Jeannette Wilkinson's political and trade union activities. She died after a severe attack of asthmatic bronchitis on 22 August 1886 at 115 Westmoreland Road, Walworth, London, the home she shared with her brother and his wife. She was buried in Forest Hill cemetery, London, on 27 August. A memorial fund was established by members of the women's suffrage movement to pay for a marble slab to mark her grave and to provide assistance for the education of a niece.<br>
