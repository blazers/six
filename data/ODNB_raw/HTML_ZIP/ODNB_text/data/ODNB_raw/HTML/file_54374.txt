<span class="headword">Townsend,  John</span>  (1760&#150;1832), <span class="occ">Bow Street runner</span>, was born in the Middlesex Hospital and educated at St Clement Danes school, to both of which charitable institutions he later became a subscriber. As a young man he frequented the Bow Street court, making notes on the cases, and Sir John Fielding, the chief magistrate, appointed him an officer of the court in 1781. In addition to attendance on the magistrates, he was responsible for the serving of writs and for criminal investigations and arrests within the metropolitan area. He was responsible for the first detachment of prisoners to be sent to Botany Bay in 1789, and he recorded that in 1786 he travelled to Dunkirk to arrest four men who were later hanged. As he also told the parliamentary committee on the state of the police of the metropolis in 1816, it was he who arrested the famous highwayman Jerry Abershaw in 1795 and also Broughton, who had robbed the York mail in 1794. His services as detective and security man were also in demand by private hire within and beyond London. He found regular employment at places as diverse as the Bank of England and Vauxhall Gardens, and built up a reputation for efficiency based on a detailed knowledge of the criminal fraternity and for his discretion and loyalty to his employers.<br>
<br>In 1792, following an attack on George III, Townsend was given responsibility for the security of the royal family during their public engagements, and for these services, which he continued to perform until 1831, he received &pound;200 per annum. He became a favourite of George III and of the prince of Wales, later George IV, whom he attended at Carlton House and accompanied to Brighton for many years. He enjoyed what was evidently a licensed familiarity with both monarchs, and his last public employment was to attend William IV on his coronation in September 1831. He provided protection for Lord Eldon, the lord chancellor, during the corn law riots of 1815, and Eldon's testimony to his qualities was one of several records in contemporary memoirs.<br>
<br>Townsend was a principal witness before the parliamentary select committee inquiring into policing in the metropolis in 1816, and his distinctive character is evident in his testimony, in which he clearly enjoyed expatiating on his successes, and his familiarity with those he called &#145;the first people of the nation&#146;. In his evidence he told the committee that in his early days &#145;we never had an execution where we did not grace the unfortunate gibbet with between ten and forty criminals&#146;. He expressed firm opposition to the system of blood money, whereby police officers were paid &pound;40 for a successful capital conviction, because he believed it made juries unwilling to convict; he argued that police officers should be remunerated only by increased salaries. Short and corpulent, he had a powerful personality which, it is evident, made a strong impression on both the criminal classes and the ruling classes. He became known as a &#145;public character&#146; early in his career, and appeared in caricatures over a period of forty years, frequently identified by his smart dress with a characteristic wide-brimmed hat, in a style favoured by his master, the prince of Wales, and by his addiction to the flash or cant slang of the criminal and sporting classes. He remained an officer of Bow Street for over fifty years. He lived in the Strand for a number of years, but it was at his home in Pimlico that he died on 10 July 1832. He was survived by his wife, Ann.<br>
