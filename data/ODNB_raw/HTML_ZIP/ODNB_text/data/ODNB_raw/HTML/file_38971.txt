<span class="headword">Barber,  Margaret Fairless</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Michael Fairless]</span>  (1869&#150;1901), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was born on 7 May 1869 at Castle Hill House, Rastrick, West Riding of Yorkshire, the youngest of three daughters of Fairless Barber (1835&#150;1881), solicitor and archaeologist, and his wife, Maria Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Musgrave (1831&#150;1890). Margaret, who called herself Marjorie from about the age of four, was at first educated at home by her mother and elder sisters. She read omnivorously, finishing the complete works of Dickens and much of Scott before she was twelve. When her father died in 1881 her mother was prostrated by the loss; unable to cope, she sent Margaret for a few months to relatives in Torquay, Devon, where she attended a local school. It was at this time that she began to suffer from the spinal condition that resulted in her tragically early death. With one of her sisters now married and the other away, her mother decided that the family house at Castle Hill was too large to manage and sought a home elsewhere, eventually settling in Bungay, Suffolk.<br>
<br>In 1884 Margaret went to London to train as a nurse at a small children's hospital, but regularly returned to Torquay, where she helped to nurse an ailing relative. In London she also worked for a brief period among the East End sick, notably in the slum district known as the Jago, and earned there the title &#145;the fighting sister&#146;. Her mother died unexpectedly at the age of fifty-nine in 1890. From that time on Margaret lived a varied existence, staying at different places in England and visiting Germany, where she and a female friend lodged in an old tower by the Rhine. It was while she was there that problems with her sight began, requiring treatment in Wiesbaden. Her generally poor health also necessitated nursing from a sister of charity. Margaret recovered sufficiently to return to London and resume her philanthropic work. She was financially independent and had no immediate claims on any of her relatives. It was through one of her missions that she met the Dowsons, a family with great literary, artistic, and scientific interests. They offered her a home in their Georgian house by the Thames and effectively adopted her. This upset many of Margaret's relatives, but her eldest sister approved of the arrangement, relieved that Margaret would now receive the care and attention she constantly required.<br>
<br>Margaret's increasing weakness and frequent painful spells now obliged her to give up her charitable work, and she took up writing under the name of Michael Fairless. The surname was from her father, while the first name, retaining her original initial, was that of a childhood friend, Michael McDonnell (1882&#150;1956), later chief justice of Palestine, who as a young boy had often spent his summer holidays with her family. Writing was physically difficult, and was done sitting in bed, or, if that was too tiring, lying down. When her right hand failed her, she changed to the left, and when growing weakness made writing altogether impossible, she dictated. Her first completed book was <span class="italic">The Gathering of Brother Hilarius</span> (1901), a religious romance centring on the black death, with Bungay serving as the goal of the blind friar's journey. But for some months Margaret had also been drafting pages for the work that brought her fame, <span class="italic">The Roadmender</span> (1902), a series of meditations on the road to heaven, of which she was the &#145;roadmender&#146;. This extraordinarily popular book was reprinted thirty-one times in ten years.<br>
<br>Margaret Fairless Barber died on 24 August 1901 at Mock Bridge near Henfield, Sussex, in the farmhouse where the Dowsons spent their summers. She was buried at Ashurst, near Steyning. A complete edition of her works, including a selection of letters, was published in one volume in 1931, with <span class="italic">The Roadmender</span>'s dedication: &#145;To my mother: and to earth, my mother, whom I love&#146;.<br>
