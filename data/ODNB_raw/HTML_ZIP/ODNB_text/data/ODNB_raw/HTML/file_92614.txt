<span class="headword">Alderson,  Thomas Hopper</span>  (1903&#150;1965), <span class="occ">wartime rescue party leader</span>, was born at Ashburne Stables, Sunderland, on 15 September 1903, the fifth of six children and first son of Thomas Alderson (1864&#150;1945), domestic coachman, and his wife, Sarah Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hopper (1872&#150;1942). He was educated at a village school; then at Elwick Road senior boys' school, West Hartlepool, where he became head boy. On 16 December 1914 he witnessed the bombardment of West Hartlepool by the German high seas fleet. After leaving school aged fifteen, he began work as an office boy in the local ironworks but soon became a draughtsman and then completed a five-year engineering apprenticeship, attending night school for tuition. He then went to sea as an assistant engineer, passing successive Board of Trade examinations and eventually qualifying as a first engineer.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1932 Alderson married Irene Doris (1899&#150;1991), daughter of Frederick R. A. Johnson, an agent, of West Hartlepool, and his wife, M. Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray. Alderson returned to sea until 1935 when the only child, a daughter, was born. He came ashore as an outdoor engineer in the borough engineer's department of West Hartlepool council, and supplemented his lower salary by teaching engineering drawing at the local night school. In 1938 he moved to Bridlington corporation as works supervisor. Under the <span class="roman">Air Raid Precautions Act</span> (1937), local authorities were responsible for raising local volunteer air raid precaution (ARP) services, and trained their own workforces as rescue teams. Alderson attended the Home Office central anti-gas school at Easingwold, York, and gained a first-class pass qualifying him as a local instructor.<br>
<br>As a part-time warden (detachment leader) of rescue and demolition parties in Bridlington, Alderson led teams equipped and trained to rescue people trapped under buildings demolished by enemy action. They were soon called upon, as the port of Bridlington was hard hit by German bombers: inevitably many bombs fell on neighbouring residential areas. On 15 August 1940 Alderson tunnelled under the debris of a collapsed pair of houses and rescued a woman. Five days later he tunnelled under two five-storey buildings on the Bridlington dockside where eleven people were trapped in a cellar. The wreckage was unsafe, further falls were anticipated, coal gas leaks created a serious hazard, and there was a danger of flooding from fractured water pipes. Refusing to allow other members of his team to risk themselves under the unstable building, and with enemy aircraft overhead, the badly bruised Alderson managed to bring all eleven people to safety. Three days later he tunnelled 14 feet under the foundations and wreckage of demolished buildings into a cellar and, below a three-storey wall swaying in the wind, he rescued two persons (one of whom subsequently died) from beneath a massive refrigerator which was in danger of further collapse. The rescue operation took five hours.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1940 Alderson's &#145;sustained gallantry, enterprise and devotion to duty during enemy air raids without the slightest regard for his own safety&#146;  (supplement to the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 30 Sept 1940) was recognized by the award of the George Cross. He was the first recipient of the new award instituted by George VI for outstanding acts of bravery performed away from the field of battle, often (but not exclusively) by civilians. The medal was equivalent in status to the Victoria Cross. In a contemporary radio broadcast Alderson insisted that he had received the award as the representative of Bridlington's rescue parties, who worked as a team.<br>
<br>In 1946 Alderson became an assistant highways surveyor with the East Riding of Yorkshire county council and later joined the new Civil Defence Corps, now preparing to protect the civilian population against nuclear weapons. He again attended courses at Easingwold College. Always a modest man, he never sought further recognition for his wartime services. He died of lung cancer on 28 October 1965 at Northfield Hospital, Driffield, Yorkshire, and was cremated in Scarborough. His George Cross is on permanent loan to the Imperial War Museum, where it is displayed with the medal he was awarded by the RSPCA in 1941 for rescuing two horses from a burning stable.<br>
