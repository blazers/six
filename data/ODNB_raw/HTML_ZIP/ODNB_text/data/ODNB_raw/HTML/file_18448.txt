<span class="headword">Mayne,  Zachary</span>  (1631&#150;1694), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, son of Richard Maine, was born at Exeter and baptized at St Petrock's Church there on 1 January 1632. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 October 1649, but by favour of the parliamentary visitors was soon made a demy of Magdalen College. On 6 May 1652 he graduated BA, although his period of residence was less than the regulations required. The indulgence was granted him at Oliver Cromwell's request on the recommendation of Thomas Goodwin, then president of Magdalen College. Mayne was described by Cromwell as &#145;eminently godly, of able parts, and willing to perform all his exercises&#146;  (Wood, 4.411). He was senior student in his class the following Lent, elected fellow of Magdalen in 1652 and proceeded MA on 6 July 1654.<br>
<br>A member of the Independent church gathered at Magdalen by Goodwin, Mayne preached regularly in and around Oxford, and became lecturer at Abingdon, Berkshire, on 3 April 1657. He regarded Goodwin as a very good friend and it was through the latter's influence that he was appointed lecturer at St Julian's Church in Shrewsbury on 24 March 1658. Here he was received very favourably by both the church and the town, and was inclined to accept ordination from the bishop of Bangor, but Cromwell's death in 1658 interrupted the plan.<br>
<br>On preaching &#145;Concerning the salvability of the heathen and of universal redemption&#146; in St Mary's Church, Oxford, in February 1660, Mayne was summoned before the vice-chancellor and threatened with expulsion, whereupon he retired to London until the following May. His religious opinions vacillated, but he is said to have been an Arian with leanings towards Socinianism. His published works show him to have held Arminian views. Scruples as to authority prevented him from administering the sacraments when he was an Independent preacher.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Mayne was ejected from his fellowship and retired to Dalwood in east Devon. However, he did not renounce controversy; his <span class="italic">St Paul's Travailing Pangs &hellip; or, A Treatise of Justification</span> appeared in 1662. Having expounded at length in a letter of 8 October 1669 to John Newburgh of Wooth Francis, near Bridport, his views on education&#151;&#145;I doe look upon teaching to be the highest work upon earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1.11)&#151;by about 1671 he had become a schoolmaster, and in 1672 was licensed at his house. About this time he married Katharine; the couple had a daughter, Elizabeth, and three sons, Gabriel, Samuel (<i>c</i>.1677&#150;1750), who, after graduating from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1698, proceeded BM from New Inn Hall in 1708 and practised medicine in Northampton, and Joel.<br>
<br>In another letter to Newburgh of 3 May 1671 Mayne revealed that he was raising money in his parish to fund a preaching minister, and about to hear a candidate preach, but some time before 19 January 1690, when he was made master of Exeter grammar school, he had conformed to the Church of England, probably as a layman. He enthusiastically welcomed the revolution of 1688&#150;9. In his <span class="italic">The Snare Broken</span>, published anonymously in Oxford in 1692, and written several years previously, he recanted Socinian and Arian views, and tried to confute various calumnies. This was reinforced by <span class="italic">Sanctification by Faith Vindicated</span> (1693), which contained a preface by the rector of Totnes and conformist controversialist Robert Burscough.<br>
<br>On 7 August 1694 Mayne witnessed a waterspout at Topsham near Exeter, and sent a description to the Royal Society. Four months later, on 11 November 1694, he died in Exeter, and was buried in the north aisle of St Peter's Church, Dalwood, Devon.<br>
