</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (1510&#150;1579), <span class="occ">lawyer and administrator</span>, was born on Childermas day (28 December) 1510, the second son and one of the five children of Robert Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1548), yeoman and sheep-reeve to the abbot of Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Isabel (<i>d</i>. after 1548), daughter of John Cage, yeoman, of Pakenham, Suffolk. He seems most likely to have been born at his parents' home in Drinkstone, Suffolk. Both his brothers, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1573 or later) and James (<i>d</i>. 1573), became prominent members of London livery companies, the Salters' and the Fishmongers' respectively. His sisters, Anne and Barbara, married within the lesser gentry of Suffolk, where the family had deep roots.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesandfamily"></a>Marriages and family</h2>Bacon married Jane Ferneley (<i>d</i>. 1552), daughter of a Suffolk yeoman, on 5 April 1540 and with her had six surviving children, of whom only the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Nathaniel Bacon")</script>, enjoyed a career of any note; the others were Elizabeth, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1003/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Bacon, Nathaniel (1546?&#150;1622)")</script>], Anne, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/989/', "Edward Bacon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Bacon, Nathaniel (1546?&#150;1622)")</script>], and a second Elizabeth. Jane's sister Anne married the London merchant and future royal financial agent Thomas Gresham (<i>c</i>.1518&#150;1579), making Bacon and Gresham brothers-in-law.<br>
<br>Jane Bacon died late in 1552, and by February 1553 her husband had married Anne, daughter of the humanist and statesman Sir Anthony Cooke (1504&#150;1576) of Gidea Hall, Essex, and a familiar figure at court in the days of Queen Katherine Parr. Bacon's children from this second marriage were the future courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/988/', "Anthony Bacon")</script> and the future chancellor and philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/990/', "Francis Bacon")</script>. In addition to her formidable intellect, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/987/', "Anne Bacon (c.1528&#150;1610)")</script> brought with her an exceptionally important set of marital connections. Her four sisters married respectively: William Cecil (Mildred); the London goldsmith Ralph Rowlett (Margaret); the courtier-humanist Thomas Hoby and then John Russell, second earl of Bedford (Elizabeth); and the diplomat Henry Killigrew (Katherine).<h2>
<a name="Youthandeducation"></a>Youth and education</h2>Bacon's career amply demonstrates the value of education to social mobility in his time. He progressed in 1523 from the abbey grammar school at Bury St Edmunds to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Both institutions were then known for progressive theological ideas. The tradition that Bacon's father intended him for the clergy but that the young Nicholas ran away when faced with the tonsure seems apocryphal: Bacon entered Corpus Christi, a college known for training clerics, on a <span class="roman">Bible</span> scholarship and must have accepted the idea of such a career. Entering a decade before the emergence of the &#145;Athenian tribe&#146; which was such a fertile training ground for the generation of statesmen and intellectuals who served Elizabeth, Bacon nevertheless made connections at Cambridge which proved formative to both his intellectual development and his career. These included the future Archbishop Matthew Parker, the future protestant martyr Thomas Dusgate, and probably other young reformers frequenting the White Horse inn and the parish church of St Mary the Great. Academically successful, Bacon came third among his year in 1527.<br>
<br>Bacon's early postgraduate years, 1527&#150;32, are largely unrecorded, though it is obvious that thoughts of a clerical career proved ephemeral. It is likely that he followed his brothers to seek his fortune in London; he may have travelled abroad. Having perhaps first attended an inn of chancery, by 1532 he had entered Gray's Inn and quickly made his mark in legal studies. He became a barrister a year later, an ancient in 1536, a bencher in 1550, and treasurer in 1552, serving in the latter post at least into 1556 and thus through the extensive reconstruction of the inn's main hall in the reign of Mary.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandestate"></a>Early career and estate</h2>In the study of the law Bacon found both his true m&eacute;tier and the first sure rungs to a career. By mid-1538 he had appeared on the payroll of the newly formed court of augmentations. His appointment indicates that he had the patronage of Thomas Cromwell, while the fact that Archbishop Thomas Cranmer described him in that year as &#145;of so good judgment touching Christ's religion&#146;, and recommended him (unsuccessfully) for the post of town clerk of Calais, shows that he was already committed to the reformist camp  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 1.359). By 1539 Bacon was serving as deputy to the solicitor of the augmentations, Walter Henley, and by 1540 he had succeeded Henley as solicitor at &pound;70 a year.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1540s Bacon began building a landed estate, purchasing properties (several of them former monastic) especially in and around the western half of his native Suffolk, and to a lesser extent in western Norfolk, Essex, London, and elsewhere. He bought the Suffolk manor of Redgrave in 1545, and began building his first country seat there almost at once. In 1560, with his well-established career in London and Westminster making it difficult to spend much time in Suffolk, he purchased the Hertfordshire manor of Gorhambury, outside St Albans, and built a substantial mansion there. The main construction of Gorhambury House took place from 1563 to 1568, with a long gallery added about 1574.<br>
<br>Bacon's work at the augmentations brought him further prominence as a loyal and effective official. No later than 1542 he had entered parliament, sitting as one of the knights of the shire for Westmorland, his selection being probably ultimately due to influence wielded at court, perhaps by the earl of Cumberland. He sat again in 1545, this time for Dartmouth, through the patronage either of his augmentations colleague Sir Thomas Arundel or that of his friend John, Lord Russell. Unusually, the townsmen paid Bacon for his services, suggesting that he was feed by them as their counsel, or even their recorder.<br>
<br>The next step in Bacon's rise came in September 1546, when he took over as attorney to the court of wards and liveries; his position was formalized in January 1547 and he held it until 1561. Although particular expertise was not then as necessary a qualification for office as it later became, Bacon would have been an obvious candidate under any circumstances. In addition to his obvious administrative skills and experience, his share in a report commissioned by Henry VIII on the state of the inns of court&#151;what has come to be known from its authors as the &#145;Denton-Bacon-Carey report&#146;, written some time about 1538&#150;40&#151;exhibited his concerns for educating the sons of the well-to-do. This worthy but stillborn vision recommended the creation of a fifth inn, to be run as something of a humanist academy, in which young men could be trained in the arts of law and diplomacy.<br>
<br>Bacon worked diligently at the wards and frequently returned to the subject of education for the young. He eventually committed his views to paper in a manuscript of 1561 (BL, Add. MS 32379, fols. 26&#150;33) entitled &#145;Articles devised for the bringing up &hellip; of the queen's majesty's wards&#146;. In it he returned to the idea of a humanist academy which might not only educate the individual child in the broad sense, thus fulfilling the moral obligation of a guardian, but also prepare him for a career in government service.<br>
<br>Bacon matched his theoretical concerns for education with practical application. He provided fine educations for his five sons. To educate boys in communities with which he became associated he founded or refounded grammar schools at Redgrave, Bury St Edmunds, and St Albans, and wrote the governing statutes for each. To Cambridge he donated some seventy books in 1574, gave &pound;200 in 1578 which he estimated (erroneously, as it happened) as sufficient to build the new chapel at Corpus Christi, and established six scholarships for boys from Redgrave School to attend that college. His statue stands across from Parker's at the entrance to the college chapel, rebuilt in the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>The death of Edward VI on 6 July 1553 and the subsequent scramble for the throne placed Bacon in a difficult position, both professionally and geographically. His close association with the Reformation, and with many who were prominent in advancing it, gave him reason to fear a Roman Catholic regime. Yet because his seat at Redgrave and the burgeoning political presence which went with it lay in precisely the East Anglian areas to which Mary Tudor fled, it was impossible for him to temporize in announcing his loyalties. Here his bride of five months, Anne Bacon, proved both her own mettle and her value to him. She had probably been recently in Mary's service, and now, between 9 and 12 or 13 June, she made her way to Kenninghall and there pledged her support to Mary. Her husband's movements are obscure, but thanks to Anne's prompt action he and Cecil were permitted to make their peace with Mary at Ipswich between 24 and 26 July; Robert Wingfield, in whose house the latter was staying, records that &#145;Bacon's wife, who had once been a waiting woman of Queen Mary's, was their chief aid in beseeching pardon for them&#146;  (MacCulloch, 270). Somewhat ironically in view of her strong protestant convictions, Anne became a gentlewoman of the new queen's privy chamber.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding that safe transition from Edward's regime to Mary's, the latter's reign proved awkward for Bacon. He retained his post at the wards, continued to be active at Gray's Inn, and kept his head down in other ways, neither advancing further nor losing his footing in royal service. At the same time, and along with his brother-in-law Sir William Cecil, he kept in close touch with his father-in-law, Sir Anthony Cooke, and other protestant exiles.<h2>
<a name="Lordkeeper"></a>Lord keeper</h2>Elizabeth's accession found Bacon a strong candidate for high office. He had become known as broadly educated and particularly learned in the law; he had served long and well in the courts of augmentations and then wards; he had been linked with the Reformation and the rise of protestantism on the one hand but had demonstrated his moderation and ability to compromise on the other. Perhaps of equal importance to the rest, he could bring to the queen's service his strong links with several important circles. These included the extensive family connections wrought by both his marriages: those to Gresham and the world of London politics and finance; those to the Cooke sisters and their husbands and reform-minded associates. They also included his considerable political presence in East Anglia as well as important groups of friends and associates from his days at Cambridge, Gray's Inn, the augmentations, and the wards.<br>
<br>Within weeks of her accession Elizabeth called upon Bacon's advice in forming her government and his help in persuading the reluctant Parker to take the see of Canterbury. She knighted Bacon about 15 December 1558. A week later (too socially conservative to name a common-born lawyer lord chancellor) she made him a privy councillor and named him lord keeper of the great seal with all the perquisites and powers of the chancellorship. A statute confirming that arrangement, and perhaps reflecting his insecurity about it, followed later on: 5 Eliz. c. 18. As lord keeper Bacon presided <i>ex officio</i> over the House of Lords (the only non-peer to sit there), allowing him to exercise his renowned eloquence and wit as the queen's spokesman.<br>
<br>His appointment also honoured Bacon's extensive legal expertise by placing him at the head of the court of chancery. Although denied the full title of the office, Bacon served longer and arguably with greater impact than any lord chancellor of the century. He was greatly admired by his contemporaries, including Queen Elizabeth herself, who wept at his memory when appointing his successor. The latter was Sir Thomas Egerton, later Baron Ellesmere, who said of Bacon on this occasion that &#145;he was wiser than any that are ever like to succeed him&#146;  (Jones, 82), and whose reforms of chancery were largely an implementation of his predecessor's plans and policies. Bacon actively clarified that court's jurisdiction and issued specific orders to formalize several legal actions, including <i>supersedeas</i>, <i>certiorari</i>, and testimony <i>in perpetuam rei memoriam</i>. He regulated the duties of the six clerks and the clerks of the petty bag, insisted on rigorous standards of professionalism from the masters in chancery, and took particular pains to clarify the jurisdiction and advance the standing of the cursitors. In 1566 he issued ordinances regarding the latter's authority, saw to their incorporation as a professional body in 1573, and some time later negotiated the acquisition from Lincoln's Inn of a tract of land on Chancery Lane on which to build them an office building. On legal matters outside the purview of chancery as such, he proposed reform of the operation of JPs and of the printing and promulgation of statutes. Finally, his views on the nature of judicial leniency and on prerogative authority, expressed in several speeches and legal decisions rather than in any comprehensive treatise, considerably elucidated both concepts.<h2>
<a name="Religiouspolicy"></a>Religious policy</h2>As a privy councillor Bacon was involved in most of the activities of the queen's government. His first statements on religion came in his opening address to parliament in January 1559. Although his oft-quoted and notably eloquent speech could be taken more as a statement of Elizabeth's views than of his own, his call for moderation and tolerance seems to be essentially that of a man who was wholly committed to a reformist position, and anxious to foster its triumph as smoothly as possible against overt opposition. His leading role in that effort was nowhere more obvious than during the Easter recess, when he presided at the Westminster disputation between the Marian and the Elizabethan bishops over the nature of the church settlement then being debated. In an unusually heavy-handed display of support for the reformist position, Bacon bullied the Catholic bishops into submission and helped goad two of them into behaviour sufficiently offensive to justify their imprisonment. They remained incarcerated just long enough for the reconvened session to pass a more protestant version of the settlement, which scraped through the Lords by only three votes.<br>
<br>Bacon's position on religion in subsequent years was by no means as extreme as that of many of his contemporaries, and even some of his fellow privy councillors. Although not necessarily a radical puritan, Bacon unquestionably held strong reformist views. In his exercise of the ecclesiastical patronage which his keepership put at his disposal (he could expect to present to a substantial number of livings each year) he showed a perceptible sympathy with the aims of bishops and archdeacons who had been exiles under Mary. Indeed, to Catholics and conservatives both in England and abroad he came to symbolize the protestant cause. In 1568 the Spanish ambassador referred to him as &#145;one of the most pernicious heretics in Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 79). In 1572 he and Cecil were so sharply attacked for their views in an anonymous tract known as <span class="italic">A Treatise of Treasons againste Queen Elizabeth and the Crowne of England</span>, published abroad, that they were defended by name in the queen's proclamation ordering the destruction of seditious books of 28 September 1573. In subsequent years the value which Bacon placed on a <i>via media</i> kept him from espousing extreme positions in religion in the glare of court politics. Yet both he and his wife did their part in the cause of protestant reform whenever this could be done circumspectly. Together they sheltered and supported known puritans at Gorhambury and in other livings under their control. Bacon winked at the prophesyings which so distressed Elizabeth, furthered the influence of reformist gentry in East Anglia, and on several occasions even ran foul of his old friend Matthew Parker in encouraging the circumvention of the strict letter of the law in religious observance.<br>
<br>Another subtle expression of Bacon's perspective on religious issues is revealed by his views on foreign affairs. Again he generally thought along the same lines as Cecil, though there were exceptions to this. He was much slower than Cecil to counsel supporting the Scottish lords of the congregation in late 1559, and in May 1563 he drew a notably angry rebuke from Cecil when he urged the surrender of the plague-stricken English garrison at Newhaven (Le Havre) against the secretary's wishes. Nevertheless, the two shared an active vigilance against the Catholic forces of Europe, tempering it (Bacon perhaps more than Cecil) with a keen sensitivity to England's limited fiscal resources. Bacon offered Cecil valuable advice on how to handle the arrival of the duke of Alva's payships which were storm driven onto England's south coast in November 1568.<h2>
<a name="Standingatcourt"></a>Standing at court</h2>In almost all respects Bacon proved sure-footed in traversing the contentious political issues of Elizabeth's early years, but there was one exception. His apparent involvement in John Hales's efforts to build a case for the legitimacy of Katherine Seymour (Lady Jane Grey's sister) as Elizabeth's closest heir to the throne landed Bacon in hot water in summer 1563. Hales had circulated a pamphlet on the subject in the aftermath of Elizabeth's near-fatal bout of smallpox in October 1562, and after she reportedly designated Lord Robert Dudley as protector of the realm on what many took to be her deathbed. Once Hales's proposals came to light in the following spring, and the queen sought to probe the full extent of what she took to be a presumptuous and even treasonous intervention, it appeared that Bacon helped Hales gather information and legal opinions. Undoubtedly urged on by Dudley, who no doubt saw Bacon, with Cecil, as obstacles to his ambitions, Elizabeth vented her fury on her lord keeper. His influence dwindled rapidly in the latter months of 1563 until he was banished from the court and privy council altogether by the end of the year. His disgrace, and the &#145;disquietude of mind&#146; and even ill health which came with it, lasted until spring 1565.<br>
<br>In the end, and with Cecil's help, Bacon regained his previous standing and even managed an eventual rapprochement with Dudley, now earl of Leicester. Yet the experience proved very painful and had lasting effects. It emphasized his dependence on the queen's favour, and on Cecil's continued support, for his career and very livelihood. It reconfirmed his inclinations to avoid behaviour which could be construed as extreme. It also took its toll on his health. Although this had not been especially robust beforehand, it now increasingly limited his activities and caused increasingly frequent, if short, absences from his official duties. Although most of his illnesses remain undefined, Bacon suffered from gout, a tendency towards kidney stones, and above all, the discomforts of substantial corpulence in his latter years.<h2>
<a name="Politicalinvolvements"></a>Political involvements</h2>A full indication of Bacon's restoration to the queen's favour came following the flight to England of Mary, queen of Scots, in May 1568, and in the political challenges arising from that dramatic event. Acknowledging his reputation for legal acumen, eloquence, and integrity, Elizabeth chose Bacon to preside over the conference convened at Westminster later that year to determine the extent of Mary's responsibility for the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. This was a tricky assignment in all sorts of ways, and Bacon excelled at giving the impression of a sensitive and fair-minded investigation while reaching a desirably indecisive conclusion.<br>
<br>The rising of the northern earls in 1569 gave another fillip to Bacon's fortunes at court. As Elizabeth well knew, the attempted coup was as much directed at Cecil and such of his close associates as Bacon as it was towards her. Its failure left those figures very much more in command of the scene than they had for some time been. She relied on both councillors to investigate the rising after its collapse.<br>
<br>The northern rising was also closely linked to the presence of Mary Stewart in England, and though the rising itself came to an abrupt end, Mary's presence continued to plague the queen and court. In her prolonged and agonizing indecision, Elizabeth chose Bacon in the following spring to preside over the York House conference which was at least to appear to hear from all sides on Mary's appropriate fate. Once again Bacon skilfully brought the meeting to the sort of impasse which the indecisive Elizabeth found appropriate. In the ensuing months, Bacon's urgings against the idea of freeing Mary earned him the reputation with the French ambassador Fenelon as &#145;chef de la partie contraire&#146;  (Teulet, 3.187), and earned him Elizabeth's mild disapproval as well. He then turned to support the idea of a royal match with the duc d'Anjou which had long been on the table, and which he and others preferred to a Marian succession.<br>
<br>In the end the Ridolfi Plot of 1572 did more to discredit Queen Mary than any machinations by Bacon or others at court. Bacon had but to preside, in the House of Lords, over the full expression of indignation which ensued. By that time he was not only fully restored in the queen's graces, but had realized the peak of his political influence. He would by no means disappear suddenly from the scene thereafter, but his declining health in subsequent years gradually diminished the force of his presence. To an increasing extent his involvement in current affairs came not directly in the council chamber, but through letters from Gorhambury or his house near Charing Cross in London.<br>
<br>In these latter years Bacon sustained his concern for the royal succession and for the nation's security from foreign entanglements or even attack. Yet he also retained his vivid awareness of England's modest resources in pursuing expensive and risky policies abroad. This made him more cautious than most of his fellow councillors on the question of open intervention in the Netherlands in 1575&#150;6, and more willing than most to encourage the Dutch to come to terms with their Habsburg rulers or, when events made this increasingly implausible, to accept French support and even overlordship.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Bacon maintained a political presence away from court as well as at it. Even from his days at the augmentations, his prominence at Westminster made him a valuable high steward for numerous landholding interests, including the archdiocese of Canterbury and the dioceses of Ely, Gloucester, Bristol, Winchester, and Chester. The Elizabethan years brought him high stewardships for Trinity College, Cambridge; the honour of Clare, Suffolk; and the borough of St Albans. Those offices, added to the bulk of his landed estate and the extensive activity of his sons Nathaniel, Nicholas, and Edward, also gave him a key political presence in the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, and particularly in urban centres like Norwich and Bury St Edmunds.<br>
<br>Right to the end, as much as his health permitted, Bacon remained engaged in the affairs of both the privy council and the chancery. A commission to investigate the operation of the mint in spring 1578, further plans to improve the cursitors' role in chancery, and the construction of a chapel for which he had left funds at his old Cambridge college, took up as much time in this period as his active correspondence and exchanges of news from court. These days brought recognition and honour as well. Elizabeth paid him the honour of a four-day visit to his home at Gorhambury in 1577, one which even an expenditure of nearly &pound;600 could not tarnish. Months later the queen sent him a new year's gift of a silver bowl, crossing his gift to her <i>en route</i>.<h2>
<a name="Deathandpersonality"></a>Death and personality</h2>The end came on 20 February 1579, probably from pneumonia. As his son Francis later recalled, Bacon had several days earlier fallen asleep in his barber's chair and broken into a heavy sweat. Seeking to cool him, the barber opened the window onto a cold winter's day and thus gave Bacon a chill which led to his final illness. His body lay in state at his York House residence in London for nearly a fortnight, as tributes poured in from far and wide, before his burial in St Pauls Cathedral on 9 March. The tributes included a laudatory poem by George Whetstone, a verse from the Scottish humanist and royal tutor George Buchanan (who also wrote the inscription for Bacon's tomb, erected in the cathedral in 1576), and a touching letter from the puritan parliamentarian Thomas Norton which remarked at length upon Bacon's sensitivity towards his family.<br>
<br>Bacon was indeed a sensitive man, not only towards those with whom he dealt professionally, but also towards his wives and children. His poem to his wife, Anne, upon her illness in 1558, is but one of his written expressions of affection. His relatively few surviving family letters attest the same concern for her and for his children from both marriages: his was surely a companionate marriage.<br>
<br>Nor is it his only poem. Bacon was something of a bibliophile and a student of classical literature. He enjoyed reading poetry, or having Anne read it to him when he was ill. He also wrote a number of poems himself, evidently intended for his own pleasure rather than for publication. Although undated, they seem to have been composed after his marriage to Anne in 1553&#151;many of them perhaps in the period of his disgrace from late 1563 to mid-1565&#151;and were published only in 1919 by the Daniel Press, Oxford, under the title <span class="italic">The Recreations of his Age</span>. Most of them deal with weighty subjects in the classical mode, such as love, moral philosophy, and religion, and emphasize the stoic virtues (which were also Bacon's virtues) of hard work, education, reason over emotion, and the value of the mean estate. But some are lighter and anecdotal in nature. A few, including &#145;Of a Snowe Balle&#146; and &#145;Of a Lover&#146; draw clearly on Petrarchan conceits and show a playful inventiveness of imagery.<br>
<br>Despite his accomplishments and stature, and the high esteem of his contemporaries, there are indications that Bacon never forgot his origins, or felt entirely secure in the social and political circles to which he ascended. Although reasonably well off, his was very far from one of the great fortunes of the day. He must have felt the limits of his place every time he presided over the Lords, each and every one of whom held a rank which the conservative Elizabeth kept ever beyond his grasp. And before the queen paid him the honour of her first visit to Gorhambury in 1572, he wrote a confidential letter to Cecil asking how to bring the occasion off, pointing out how &#145;rawe&#146; he was in such matters.<h2>
<a name="Culturalinterests"></a>Cultural interests</h2>To support his literary and philosophical interests, Bacon assembled a library which was very substantial for its time. When in 1574 he gave some seventy volumes to Cambridge at Archbishop Parker's urging, he printed his own dated bookplate to mark the occasion: allegedly the first Englishman to have such a device. It bears his arms, his motto (<i>Mediocria firma</i>&#151;&#145;Safety in moderation&#146;), and a personal inscription marking the donation. In addition, he (and/or perhaps Anne) had stencilled a series of Latin <i>sententiae</i> on the walls at Gorhambury, largely Senecan (as was his motto) in substance and derivation. They show his deep humanist learning, his affinity for the works of Horace, Cicero, and Seneca in particular, and his essential humanity.<br>
<br>The eloquence and wit by which his contemporaries knew Bacon, and which they often quoted, undoubtedly owed something to these classical models. Most of his important parliamentary speeches have survived in manuscript copies which were made as much for the sake of their rhetorical content as for their political content. Contemporaries like George Puttenham, Thomas Nashe, and William Camden, and slightly later writers like Ben Jonson, who knew Bacon only by reputation, considered him among the most eloquent men of his time. Authors like these would perhaps have been especially attracted by the neo-classical tone of his speech and writings, but he could also turn a homely quip at will. When he first saw Cecil's house at Theobald's and found the privy too close to the larder and lodgings, he remarked that &#145;you had bene better to have offendyd yor yey outward than yor nose inward&#146;  (Tittler, 66). More famously, when Elizabeth made her first visit to Gorhambury and commented on how small it seemed, he covered his wounded pride with a witty allusion to his own expanding girth, &#145;Madame, my house is well, but it is you that have made me too great for my house&#146;  (ibid., 215). Her next stay allowed him to display a new long gallery 120 feet long, built in the hope of just such a return visit.<br>
<br>In addition to numerous protestant (and puritanically inclined) clerics and tutors, Bacon patronized several writers and scientists. The latter included Leonard Digges in his works on optics and Thomas Blundeville (who also served as a tutor in the Bacon household) in his mathematical investigations. His two country houses, Redgrave as well as the later Gorhambury, and the house at Stiffkey, Norfolk, which he built for his son Nathaniel, show him to have been an active builder. His accounts reveal his close supervision of their design and construction. The architectural vocabulary of these structures is for the most part that of the English Gothic tradition, but the porch which he added at Gorhambury is exceptional, and serves as another reminder of Bacon's humanistic inclinations. Evidently done by a master craftsman familiar with the artistically precocious circle of Protector Somerset, it represented one of the first truly Renaissance structures of its type in England.<h2>
<a name="Therewardsofservice"></a>The rewards of service</h2>Notwithstanding the expense of such building projects and his financial distance from the wealthiest men of the day, Bacon was certainly comfortably affluent at his death two years later. He had the satisfaction of having established his family, and especially the three sons of his first marriage, with estates and connections linking them to a wide circle of East Anglian gentry. He managed his properties and his professional income closely and well. For a man of his rank he lived in relative frugality, entertaining in the grand manner but rarely, and travelling little save from his London home at York House near Charing Cross to Redgrave, and later to Gorhambury. His worth in cash on hand and plate at his death came to some &pound;4450, about equal to his annual income, to which his lands and other investments have to be added. His debts came to but &pound;860. It may well be that he was poised to spend some of this cash to purchase an estate for young Francis, the only one of his five sons not yet thus provided for. His will nevertheless served them all handsomely, also containing bequests or gifts to twenty-five of his chancery associates, nine personal retainers, seventeen relatives, and a further nine friends and colleagues. His funeral alone cost some &pound;900.<br>
