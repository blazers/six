<span class="headword">Postlethwayt,  Malachy</span>  (1707&#150;1767), <span class="occ">writer on economics and publicist</span>, was born on 5 May 1707 and baptized on 25 May at St Dunstan's, Stepney, Middlesex, the eldest son of John Postlethwayt (1671&#150;1729), victualler of Limehouse, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blundell (<i>b</i>. 1678). His younger brother was the writer on finance and demography <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22597/', "James Postlethwayt (1711&#150;1761)")</script>. Details of his education are unclear, though like his brother he may have attended St Paul's School, London, for the period <i>c</i>.1717 to 1721. On 9 December of this year he was apprenticed to the prominent London writing-master Charles Snell, who may have introduced Postlethwayt to the Society of Antiquaries, to which he was elected a fellow in March 1735.<br>
<br>By this date Postlethwayt had been for several years employed by the prime minister, Robert Walpole, as a writer and government publicist. From the early 1730s he was principally engaged in writing pamphlets in support of the introduction of excise taxes, and later claimed twelve years' service with Walpole. In 1743 he secured a position with the Royal Africa Company and was elected a member of the company's court of assistants in January 1745. His first publication, <span class="italic">The African Trade, the Great Pillar and Supporter of the British Plantation Trade in America</span>, appeared in the same year. In 1749 he outlined proposals for a commercial treaty with Spain, allied to a merger of the African and South Sea companies.<br>
<br>His term at the Royal Africa Company having ended in 1746, Postlethwayt embarked on several unsuccessful ventures, including a patent for casting iron (1748) and involvement in a lead smelting business in northern England. As he explained in the entry for &#145;Chemistry&#146; from his <span class="italic">Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce</span> (1751&#150;5), the latter enterprise saw him tricked by unscrupulous &#145;chemical jugglers&#146; and &#145;pretenders&#146;  (Postlethwayt, 1.487) and deceived because of his ignorance of smelting and refining. The experience resolved Postlethwayt &#145;to make chemistry in theory and practice&#146;  (ibid.) an area for his studies, the success of which can be tested from his 1747 publication on the possibility of &#145;the making of Bar Iron with Pitt, or Sea Coal Fire&#146;. His later writings reveal his continuing fascination with matters chemical.<br>
<br>In addition to his government work Postlethwayt devoted much of the 1740s and 1750s to the preparation of his major work, <span class="italic">The Universal Dictionary</span>, which appeared in instalments between 1751 and 1755 and subsequently as a two-volume work (1757; 4th edn, 1774). This has been described as an amplified and Anglicized version of the <span class="italic">Dictionnaire universal de commerce</span> (written largely by Jacques Savary des Brulons), the extent of the departures reflecting Postlethwayt's &#145;greater interest in political problems; his more intense economic nationalism; and his exuberant belief in the economic usefulness of experimental philosophy&#146;  (Johnson, 187&#150;8, 402). More specifically, the penultimate sentence of the dictionary's introduction conveyed Postlethwayt's intentions concisely:<blockquote>This work is designed throughout to raise the spirit of universal art and industry in this nation, that the labour and ingenuity of our people, being inferior to those of no other state and empire, the kingdom may not dwindle into poverty and ignominy; and from being the greatest nation in the world, we may not become the least and the most contemptible. (Postlethwayt, l.x)</blockquote>It therefore contained many practical articles on inventions and improvements, as well as on commercial practice such as banking, commercial bills, and customs house business, hence catering for the considerable interest in compendia of knowledge of the mid-eighteenth century. This last enthusiasm was also evident in Postlethwayt's proposal for a remodelled Royal Society to enable it to collect information useful to British trade as well as to recommend new manufactures and new avenues of trade for official encouragement and support.<br>
<br>Improvement of British commerce formed the inspiration for Postlethwayt's final major works, <span class="italic">Britain's Commercial Interests Explained and Improv'd</span> and <span class="italic">Great Britain's True System</span>, both published in 1757. The former, though not a very innovative work, was especially strong on advocating expansion of the Union by including Ireland and encouraging agricultural improvement to cheapen the necessities of life, permitting lower wages and increased competitiveness in foreign markets. They were also designed to secure his own self-improvement through patronage, a strategy which was apparently unsuccessful. Together with the dictionary, these books contained the economic contributions for which Postlethwayt has been largely noted in the literature on the history of economic ideas. Their lengthy quotations from Richard Cantillon's <span class="italic">Essay on the Nature of Trade in General</span> (written in the 1730s but not published until 1755) were used in the late nineteenth century to write off Postlethwayt's work as pure plagiarism, but this accusation has been greatly exaggerated. A notable theme in Postlethwayt's three principal works was the relative superiority of French over British commercial institutions for the regulation and promotion of business interests. Key to these was France's network of local chambers of commerce, established from 1701, of which he became an early and important British advocate. The content of Postlethwayt's work on the African slave trade also provided Eric Williams with compelling evidence for his thesis in <span class="italic">Capitalism and Slavery</span> (1944). Postlethwayt returned to government service under the premiership of Henry Pelham, and was again engaged in pamphleteering on behalf of the ministry. However, relations worsened when Postlethwayt requested government documents for the compilation of his <span class="italic">Universal Dictionary</span>. From 1751, and with the brief exception of the Rockingham administration (1765&#150;6), he appears to have had little involvement with politics, in contrast to the rising fortunes of his brother James as an adviser and intermediary. Outstanding payments and, from 1756, disputes with the <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>'s printers worsened his financial situation.<br>
<br>Postlethwayt died &#145;suddenly&#151;, as he had often wished&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>) on 13 September 1767, unmarried, and in relative poverty. He was buried in Old Street churchyard, Clerkenwell, London.<br>
