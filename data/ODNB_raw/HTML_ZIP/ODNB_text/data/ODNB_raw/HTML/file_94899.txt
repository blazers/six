<span class="headword">Moorey,  (Peter) Roger Stuart</span>  (1937&#150;2004), <span class="occ">archaeologist and museum curator</span>, was born on 30 May 1937 at 64 Hazelwood Road, Bush Hill Park, Middlesex, the elder child of Stuart (Sam) Moorey (1906&#150;1951), deputy head of Tottenham grammar school and a teacher of history and rugby, and his wife, Freda Delanoy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (1909&#150;1947). His mother died when he was nine; his father remarried but died soon afterwards, leaving him at the age of twelve with a sister and a baby half-sister. He became an avid reader from an early age, with an interest in archaeology. This was exemplified in his habit of mummifying his sister's dolls, burying them, and drawing a map so that they could be located again. After attending (as a boarder) Mill Hill School, where he was inspired by a talk given by the archaeologist Leonard Woolley, he was conscripted for national service, which he served in Cyprus with the army intelligence corps between 1956 and 1958. From this experience came habits of punctuality, extreme self-discipline manifested in brilliantly polished shoes, and a strong sense of public service.<br>
<br>From 1958 to 1961 Moorey read modern history (defined as beginning in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 285) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, gaining a first-class degree, and was active in the university's Archaeological Society. In 1961 he became assistant keeper at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, which was flourishing under the keepership of Robert Hamilton. There his duties spanned the ancient Near East from Egypt to Iran, allowing him to follow the advice of Hamilton: to avoid narrow specialization, and to be flexible in the face of upheavals which shut off access to Middle Eastern countries from time to time. At that time the Ashmolean could still augment its acquisitions both from excavations in the Middle East and from dealers and generous donors. He set to work on the museum's many unpublished collections, beginning with a doctoral thesis on Luristan bronzes which resulted in his <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Ancient Persian Bronzes in the Ashmolean Museum</span> (1971). This gave him an interest in the development of the horse harness&#151;enhanced by meetings with Mary Littauer and J. H. Crouwel&#151;in the development of bronze technology, and technological progress in warfare. He continued by salvaging information from chaotic records of old excavations at Kish, conducted by an Oxford&#150;Chicago expedition in central Iraq. Long after his book <span class="italic">Kish Excavations, 1923&#150;1933</span> appeared (in 1978) he encouraged a wide range of scholars to work on material from Kish. Another major achievement was to complete the cataloguing of the Ashmolean's fine collection of cylinder and stamp seals, taking up the work of Briggs Buchanan. Three volumes were published to a high standard.<br>
<br>For one season in 1963 Moorey joined the excavations of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem under Kathleen Kenyon, but was treated in hospital for a bad attack of hepatitis. His participation gave him a formative, long-lasting interest in biblical archaeology which eventually resulted in his revision (1987) of Kenyon's last book, <span class="italic">The Bible and Recent Archaeology</span> (1978); it was preceded by his Ashmolean Museum booklet <span class="italic">Archaeology, Artefacts and the Bible</span> (1969), and followed much later by <span class="italic">A Century of Biblical Archaeology</span> (1991), a work of intellectual history. Kenyon was principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford, from 1962 to 1973, so they were university colleagues for eleven years.<br>
<br>In 1975, 1977, and 1981 Moorey joined the excavations of Nicholas Postgate at Abu Salabikh in southern Iraq, where he pursued an interest in the early dynastic period, including its manifestations at Kish, and links with Egypt when the kingdoms of upper and lower Egypt were first united. In 1982 he produced an invaluable revision of Leonard Woolley's work on discoveries at Ur, from the same area of Iraq. Early experiences in detecting forgeries in Luristan metalwork and in Chalcolithic pottery, including objects bought by the Ashmolean, gave him a keen awareness of the potential of archaeological science, enhanced by an early friendship with Michael Tite, who later became professor of archaeological science at Oxford. This resulted in his magnum opus, <span class="italic">Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries</span> (1994, rev. 1999), an invaluable compilation, like his others, of careful synthesis avoiding theoretical interpretations. He was exceptionally neat and well organized in his work.<br>
<br>In 1983 Moorey became keeper of the Ashmolean, and remained there until retirement in 2002, resisting an attempt to lure him to a professorship in the USA, and refusing to put his name forward for the directorship of the museum. Focused on research and teaching, he did not instigate exhibitions nor take much interest in museum gallery display. He was elected a fellow of Wolfson College in 1976, and became vice-regent (2002&#150;4). His last work, on terracotta figurines in the Ashmolean, gave rise to the Schweich lectures delivered in 2001 at the British Academy and published two years later as <span class="italic">Idols of the People</span>. After retirement he had hoped to make a study of warfare in the ancient Near East.<br>
<br>Moorey encouraged and maintained contact with a wide range of scholars, and was both a conscientious and an inspirational teacher. He was a genuinely modest man, generous with his wide-ranging knowledge, pragmatic, and unsentimental. Always tactful, courteous, and conciliatory, he enjoyed teaching research students and undergraduates. As a scholar he was mistrustful of ancient texts which he regarded as less reliable sources of information than material remains. Keen to engage a wider public, he was an accessible writer and lecturer who dealt patiently with the queries of specialists and lunatics alike. Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1977, he handled a heavy load of administrative duties, serving on numerous committees in Oxford and London, including the council of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. He was also vice-chairman of the council of the British Institute for the Archaeology and History of Jordan in Amman, and president of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, managing to remain on good terms with colleagues in Israel as well as in Arab countries. Editorial commitments included co-editing a Festschrift in honour of Kathleen Kenyon; and for eighteen years editing the journal <span class="italic">Levant</span>, which he founded and which was published by the British School in Jerusalem. Moorey's academic reputation was worldwide. In 1989 he received the Schimmel prize from the Israel Museum for contributions to biblical archaeology, followed by an award in 1993 from the Biblical Archaeology Society for <span class="italic">A Century of Biblical Archaeology</span>, the James R. Wiseman book award from the Archaeological Institute of America in 1996 for his book <span class="italic">Materials and Industries</span>, and the Gertrude Bell medal for outstanding services to Mesopotamian archaeology from the British School of Archaeology in Iraq (2003). These international recognitions of his scholarship, along with a Festschrift edited by three of his students, were honours graciously but lightly received, for he was not driven by personal ambition. He enjoyed conversation and good food, but remained intensely private, lived alone, and never married. He was utterly dedicated to his work and to the Ashmolean Museum. He died of cancer in the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, on 23 December 2004, and was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 11 January 2005.<br>
