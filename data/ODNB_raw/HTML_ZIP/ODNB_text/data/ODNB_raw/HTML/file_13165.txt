<span class="headword">Hey,  William</span>  (1772&#150;1844), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13163/', "William Hey (1736&#150;1819)")</script>, surgeon, and Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Banks (<i>c</i>.1737&#150;1820), was born in the family home, an apothecary's shop and premises in the Slip-in Yard, off the Briggate in Leeds, on 19 February 1772, and was baptized at St Peter's Church, Leeds, on 19 March. He became apprenticed to his father in 1787 and was groomed to take over the medical, surgical, and midwifery practice after the death of his elder brother Richard in 1789. From 1792 to 1794 Hey trained as a surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, becoming a member of the Company of Surgeons in 1794. He returned to Leeds and began as a partner to his father from new premises in Albion Street. On 12 January 1796 he married Isabella Hudson (his maternal first cousin) of Huddersfield. They had five children, <a href="#cosubject_13165">William [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1798), John (<i>b</i>. 1802), Richard (<i>b</i>. 1803), and Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1805). Isabella died of consumption in August 1805; William did not remarry. In 1796 Hey sustained an injury to his ankle which caused him to be lame for four years. He was elected an officer of the Leeds House of Recovery in 1804, and five years later his father made him an equal partner. Hey succeeded his father in 1812 as the principal surgeon at the Leeds Infirmary, retaining the post until his resignation in 1830. Hey's book <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Puerperal Fever</span> was written in 1813, but not published until 1815.<br>
<br>Hey carried on the extensive midwifery practice begun by his father. The account books show midwifery receipts until 1843, six months prior to his death. He was elected as one of the original 300 fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843. Hey took his two sons John and William into his practice, his son Richard became a surgeon in York, and his son Samuel (a bachelor) became rector of Sawley in Derbyshire. His only daughter, Mary, married John Atkinson, a solicitor in Leeds. John married, in 1824, Jane, sister of Joseph Croser, one of Hey's apothecaries. He was affectionately known by his vast family as the Governor.<br>
<br>Hey was an active member of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. A lifelong devout Christian he was an active member of the new St Paul's Church in Park Square, Leeds. He was a tory mayor of Leeds on two occasions and as mayor was chairman at a public meeting held on 9 January 1832 in the Mixed Cloth Hall in Leeds which had been called to discuss the reduction of the working hours of children. From March 1833 William had further periods of serious illness until his death at his home, 36 Albion Street, Leeds, in March 1844. He was buried in the family vault in St Paul's Church, Leeds, on 13 March 1844.<br>

He was a founder member of the Leeds school of medicine in 1831 and lectured on the principles and practice of surgery. He was president of the medical school from 1836 to 1837 and was president of the British Medical Association in 1843&#150;4 when their annual meeting was held in Leeds. He remained on the staff of the infirmary until March 1851. Hey became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1818 and was one of the original 300 fellows in 1843. He was an active member of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society and did much to promote the cultivation of music in Leeds. He died on 10 May 1875 at his estate, Gledhow House, Gledhow Wood, Leeds, a substantial property to the north of Leeds town. He was buried in the vault of St Paul's Church, Park Square, Leeds.

<a name="cosubject_71410"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Hey</span>  (1815&#150;1888), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 22 August 1815 and was baptized on 22 September at Ockbrook, Derbyshire. He was the second son of the Revd Samuel Hey, vicar of Ockbrook, and Margaret Hey (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray) of York. The Revd Samuel Hey was the youngest and second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13163/', "William Hey (1736&#150;1819)")</script>. Samuel junior attended Cox's School in Gainsborough. When he was sixteen he became an apprentice dresser at the Leeds Infirmary to his paternal uncle William Hey (1772&#150;1844), and was one of the first group of students to join the Leeds medical school in 1831, attending the very first lecture, given by Mr Teale. On 3 September 1836 Samuel became a pupil at both the North London Hospital (later University College Hospital) and St George's Hospital in London. He then had three years' medical training in Paris and Germany before returning to Leeds in 1841, when he entered into partnership with his uncle William Hey and his cousin William Hey (1796&#150;1875) in the family medical surgical and midwifery practice in Albion Street, Leeds. Hey became a lecturer in anatomy and surgery at the Leeds medical school in 1841, a post he retained until his resignation in August 1870. He was also president of the Leeds school of medicine in 1848&#150;9 and was treasurer for twelve years up to 1865. He married, in 1842, Martha Jane Jowett, who died childless. He married, in 1868, Sarah Jane Pratt (1836&#150;1874); the couple had four children. Samuel Hey was a talented musician and frequently played the organ of St Paul's Church, Park Square, Leeds. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1838 and a fellow in 1855. In 1850 he was elected surgeon to the Leeds Infirmary, holding the post until his resignation in 1872. Hey died at his home in North Hill Road, Headingley, Leeds, on 22 January 1888.<br>
