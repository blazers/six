<span class="headword">Fraser family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was of Anglo-Norman origin, probably arriving in Scotland during the reign of William the Lion. They were a baronial family of second rank whose branches acquired land in Tweeddale, Haddingtonshire, and Stirlingshire, Sir Gilbert Fraser holding the sheriffdom of Traquair, Peebles, by 1233. By the end of the thirteenth century the family had divided, the senior branches being the Frasers of Touch-Fraser (Stirling), from whom were descended the Frasers of Philorth (Buchan), and the Frasers of Oliver Castle (Tweeddale). The latter achieved political prominence in the 1260s and 1270s as part of Alexander III's promotion of &#145;new men&#146;, and they supported the Comyn&#150;Balliol party in the Great Cause of 1291&#150;2; but the execution of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39585/', "Sir Simon Fraser")</script> of Oliver Castle in 1306 brought that line of the family to an end.<br>
<br>Fraser descent continued in the senior line, that of Touch-Fraser, through Sir Richard Fraser, a cousin of Sir Simon, who was succeeded by <a name="cosubject_10098"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Fraser</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1332)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Andrew Fraser and second cousin once removed of Sir Simon. Andrew Fraser was sheriff of Stirling, and was imprisoned by the English in 1296, probably taking his family with him into captivity. Whether or not Alexander Fraser met Robert Bruce during this period, he certainly espoused his cause, for which Edward I had Fraser's lands forfeited. In 1308 Fraser fought at the battle of Loch Awe for Robert I, who evidently held him in high regard, since he made him grants of land in Forfar, Kincardine, and Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. Fraser's loyalty was demonstrated further when he fought for the king at Bannockburn, and he had been knighted by 1316, when his rising status was underlined by his prestigious marriage to the king's sister, Mary Bruce. He attended parliament in 1318, when the order of succession to the crown was settled, and by 10 December 1319 had been appointed chamberlain, holding that office until at least 5 March 1327. His seal appears on the declaration of Arbroath of 1320, and he became sheriff of Kincardine in addition to holding the hereditary office of sheriff of Stirling. His lands of Touch-Fraser in Kincardine, and his barony of Cluny and keepership of the king's park in Cowie Forest, both in Aberdeenshire, in addition to other royal favours, made Fraser one of the most important nobles north of Forth. He was killed at the battle of Dupplin in 1332, fighting for David II, and was succeeded by his son John Fraser, whose heiress-daughter married Sir William Keith, into whose hands most of the Touch-Fraser lands passed. John's younger brother, William, was the ancestor of the Frasers of Philorth (Buchan), although these were not to achieve national prominence until the early seventeenth century.<br>
<br>By the 1360s, another branch of the Fraser family, almost certainly related to the Touch-Fraser line, although the precise genealogy is unclear, was emerging in the north of Scotland. By September 1365 Hugh Fraser had acquired the lands of Lovat, Inverness-shire, probably by marriage, although no exact details survive. He died before March 1410 and was succeeded by his son, Alexander Fraser of Lovat, who had confirmation of his father's charter of the barony of Kinnell, in the sheriffdom of Forfar, from Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, the governor of Scotland. He seems to have died in 1416, as his brother <a name="cosubject_76651"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Fraser</span>, lord of Lovat  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1440), appears under this style in March 1416. In 1421 Hugh was <span class="occ">deputy sheriff of Inverness</span>, and he also took part in national politics, being one of the party which met James I at Durham on his way back to Scotland in 1424.<br>
<br>Lovat supported the king against the lord of the Isles in 1429, and consequently suffered the ravaging of his lands at Abertarff on Loch Ness. For serving the crown in the north, Lovat was rewarded with promotion to sheriff of Inverness by 1431. He was a key figure in the earl of Mar's Lochaber campaign of 1431, but following Mar's death, in 1435, Alexander MacDonald, the lord of the Isles, reasserted his position, and major north-western landowners were forced to come to terms with him, as Lovat did in January 1437, granting to his new feudal superior his right to one third of Glenelg. Lovat's first wife, Janet Fenton, had died before December 1429, by when he was married to Isabel Wemyss. He was dead by 20 July 1440, when his son, Thomas Fraser, witnessed a charter as lord of Lovat, and maintained thereafter his family's prominent position in north-west Scotland; the bond of manrent which he gave to Alexander, lord of the Isles and earl of Ross, in 1442, possibly in an effort to bring stability to local politics at a time when national politics were in a state of turmoil, is the earliest to survive. He died before 20 May 1455 and was succeeded by his son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54207"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Fraser</span>, first Lord Lovat  (<em>d.</em> 1501)<span class="occ"></span>, was a minor when he succeeded, and was placed in the ward of the earl of Moray, Elizabeth, countess of Moray, having his keepership in 1455. After Moray's death Fraser became a ward of the crown, which had administered his estates since 1450, although in 1456 his ward and marriage were granted to John Lyon, third Lord Glamis, whose daughter Violet he married before 1464. The forfeiture of the earldom of Moray in the final ruin of the Black Douglases in 1455 left Fraser, with his family's tradition of service and standing in the Inverness area, together with his links by marriage to the Lyons, another family with a demonstrable pedigree of royal service, as a prime candidate for elevation to a parliamentary peerage, and this he had duly received, under the title Lord Fraser of Lovat, by 1464. In the same year, he made an agreement with the head of the other main branch of the Fraser family, Alexander Fraser of Philorth, that each would be heir to the other, failing male heirs of their own. Such a measure demonstrates Lovat's concern to safeguard the prestige and position of his family in the face of the vagaries of inheritance, but it proved unnecessary. When Hugh Fraser died, before 14 October 1501, his son Thomas succeeded him as second Lord Lovat.<br>
