<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leonowens <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edwards]</span>,  Anna Harriette</span>  (1831&#150;1915), <span class="occ">educator and travel writer</span>, was born in Ahmadnagar, India, on 6 November 1831, the younger daughter of Thomas Edwards (<i>c</i>.1803&#150;1831), formerly a cabinet maker of St George the Martyr parish, London, then a sergeant in the sappers and miners, and his wife, Mary Anne (1815/16&#150;1873), who was possibly the illegitimate Eurasian daughter of William Vawdrey Glasscott (<i>d</i>. 1821), lieutenant in the Bombay army. Anna's father died before her birth, leaving the family penniless. On 9 January 1832 her mother married Patrick Donohoe, a corporal in the engineers, soon seconded to the public works department where he served successively as sergeant overseer (in Deesa), assistant supervisor (in Aden) and deputy commissary (in Poona).<br>
<br>It is likely that Anna first met the Irish-born Thomas Lean Owens (<i>bap</i>. 1823, <i>d</i>. 1859), in the mid-1840s, when he was paymaster sergeant with the 28th regiment at Deesa. Her parents opposed the connection which was temporarily broken when Donohoe was transferred to Aden in 1847, taking his by then large family with him. There they encountered the resident chaplain, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1021/', "Revd George Percy Badger")</script>, and his wife, Maria, a missionary schoolmistress. When the Badgers embarked on an extended tour of Egypt and Palestine, probably in 1849, Anna accompanied them. Her intellectual curiosity was stimulated by Badger, a noted orientalist and keen observer of colonial imperialism in the Middle East. It was he who introduced Anna to the study of languages (she eventually mastered eight), encouraged her interest in Eastern culture and religion, and sharpened her skills of observation and analysis.<br>
<br>Upon her return to India, Anna married &#145;Leon&#146; Owens on Christmas day 1849, in Poona; he was then a clerk in the commissary general's office at Bombay, but by May 1852, when their first child, Selina, died, he was employed by R. Frith &amp; Co., Bombay mess agents. At about this time Anna broke completely with her family, and the couple, their surname now conflated to Leonowens, went to Perth, Western Australia. There they had a second child, who died after only a few months; a third child, Avis, was born in 1854, and a fourth, Louis, in 1856. Anna, then known as Harriet, advertised a Young Ladies' School, at Perth in 1854. In February 1857 the family sailed from Perth to Singapore and went thence to Prince of Wales Island (later Penang) where Thomas ran a hotel. He died of apoplexy in Penang on 8 May 1859 and was buried in Northam Road cemetery.<br>
<br>Left impoverished with children to support, his widow opened a school in Singapore. Then in 1862 she took an appointment arranged by the Borneo Company to teach the wives and children of Rama IV of Siam, popularly known as King Mongkut. The king fathered some thirty-nine sons and forty-three daughters, procreation being a royal duty which he took seriously. The children and their mothers, along with several thousand other women and retainers (most of whom were given to the king by those seeking royal favour), lived in seclusion in Nang Harm, a walled city within the royal palace. Mongkut, an enlightened modernizer who had fostered contacts with both Americans and Europeans, wanted his children to receive a Western education, but the missionary wives whom he engaged initially had as their main object the conversion of their pupils to Christianity. Leonowens, the first Western woman to live in the palace, was contracted to &#145;do [her] best endeavour for knowledge of English language, science and literature and not for conversion to Christianity&#146;  (King Mongkut, letter of 26 Feb 1862, in A. Leonowens, <span class="italic">Governess at the Siamese Court</span>, 1954 edn, vii).<br>
<br>Taking Louis with her (but sending Avis to a London boarding-school), Leonowens served Mongkut for nearly six years, first as teacher and latterly as one of his foreign language secretaries. In her first role she is best remembered for tutoring the future King Chulalongkorn, and for intervening on behalf of the women of Nang Harm, whom she saw as enslaved and oppressed; in her second she was important to Mongkut's strategy of opening Siam to Western influence, while at the same time frustrating the territorial ambitions of France, America, and Britain. Her decidedly ambiguous position at court fed palace intrigue and fostered animosity from the Anglo-French diplomatic community. In consequence she mixed mainly with American missionaries, assimilating their professional antipathy to the heathen and polygamous king, and this later coloured her published accounts of life in Siam. Overwork, poor pay, unrelenting stress, and recurring tropical illnesses led her to secure a furlough and sail for England in July 1867. In his farewell speech Mongkut remarked: &#145;You ought to know you are [a] difficult woman and more difficult than generality&#146;  (King Mongkut, in A. Leonowens, <span class="italic">Governess at the Siamese Court</span>, 1954 edn, xv). Nevertheless, they seem to have respected and even perhaps liked each other.<br>
<br>After a brief sojourn in England and Ireland, where Louis was installed in a boarding-school, Leonowens sailed with Avis for New York in November 1867, in search of the bracing climate which her health was thought to need, and in anticipation of renewed contact with various American friends. Efforts to renegotiate her post at the Siamese court were unsuccessful, and Mongkut's death on 1 October 1868 terminated any ideas of return. Contact with the royal family, however, continued over many years, facilitated by correspondence, occasional meetings (including a memorable one with Chulalongkorn in London, in August 1897), and the considerable business success of Louis Leonowens in Siam, under Chulalongkorn's patronage, beginning in the 1880s.<br>
<br>Leonowens decided to remain in the United States where, again needing to support herself and her family, she opened a school on Staten Island; more significantly, she began to write about her life in Siam. An article in the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1869 was the prelude to two books, <span class="italic">The English Governess at the Siamese Court</span> (1870; English edn as <span class="italic">Governess at the Siamese Court</span>, 1870) and <span class="italic">The Romance of the Harem</span> (1873; English edn as <span class="italic">The Romance of Siamese Harem Life</span>, 1873). Both, but especially the second, are a mixture of biography and snippets of history and myth, frequently misrepresented. Almost immediately Leonowens was accused of having invented salacious and barbaric incidents of life in Siam, in order to titillate her audience and thus increase sales. Her books and the lecture engagements to which they gave rise did, however, bring her an income (always precarious) and an entr&eacute;e into the literary circles of New York and Boston, where her many friends included James T. Fields, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.<br>
<br>Her daughter's marriage in 1878 to Thomas Fyshe, a Scottish banker, greatly improved Leonowens's financial situation. She subsequently made her home with them in Halifax, Nova Scotia, but continued to work, notably as a writer for the <span class="italic">Youth's Companion</span>, an American periodical as whose correspondent she visited Russia in 1881. Her <span class="italic">Life and Travels in India</span> (1884), a competent travel work with little biography, was less successful than the earlier books, and her final study, <span class="italic">Our Asiatic Cousins</span> (1889), was barely noticed. Leonowens is best remembered in Halifax for her leadership in art education initiatives, social activism, and women's suffrage. From the late 1880s she spent two extended periods in Germany, supervising the education of her grandchildren; after 1901 she lived with the Fyshe family in Montreal, Canada, where she was active in arts and crafts advocacy and hospital charity work. Blinded by a stroke in 1912 and confused by age, she lingered until 19 January 1915, when her death went largely unnoticed. She was buried two days later in Mount Royal cemetery, Montreal.<br>
<br>Leonowens would probably have been entirely forgotten had Margaret Landon not published a romanticized biography, <span class="italic">Anna and the King of Siam</span> (1944), with a shorter version, <span class="italic">Anna and the King</span> (1952), on which were based a theatrical musical and films, <span class="italic">Anna and the King of Siam</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The King and I</span> (stage, 1951; screen 1956), and <span class="italic">Anna and the King</span> (Twentieth Century Fox, 1999). The stage and screen versions present an even more fanciful picture of Siam than did Leonowens's books, but are less offensive (although still patronizing) about Mongkut, who is depicted as endearing but childlike. These productions in turn led to several accounts in English by Thai and Western scholars on the true nature of the king and his reign. These did little, however, to alter the Hollywood image and have themselves been criticized for their condoning of slavery and general repression of women and children. Direct attacks on Leonowens also failed to subvert her influence. A. B. Griswold, in <span class="italic">King Mongkut of Siam</span> (1961), undermined her claim to historical accuracy and questioned her emotional stability; Ian Grimble called her &#145;a mischief-maker, a squalid little girl &hellip; one of those awful little English governesses, a sex-starved widow&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 8 Aug 1970, p. 25); while W. S. Bristowe, in <span class="italic">Louis and the King of Siam</span>, revealed how far she had invented the story of her ancestry and early life. New research has strengthened the argument for mixed ancestry and various family secrets, but has refuted much of Bristowe's genealogical research, his claim that Leonowens was raised in squalor and deprivation, and his insinuation that she travelled unchaperoned and alone with the unmarried Revd Badger. Despite, or perhaps because of, their shortcomings, her life and writings captured the imagination of the Western public, although the strident and unflattering portrayal of one of their greatest kings has continued to offend the Thai people. As one of the first westerners to write about Siam, and as one in unique contact with the king at a critical juncture in the country's history, Leonowens is remembered for having created an enduring if inaccurate image of Siam in the eyes of the West.<br>
