<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawkins,  Richard  MacGillivray</span>  (1871&#150;1955), <span class="occ">scholar of classical and modern Greek</span>, was born on 24 October 1871 at Surbiton, Surrey, the eldest child of Richard Dawkins (1828&#150;1896), a captain in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Mary Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1897), the daughter of Simon McGillivray (or MacGillivray) and granddaughter of Sir John Easthope. In 1878 his father retired with the rank of rear-admiral and made his home at Stoke Gabriel near Totnes. Dawkins received his schooling at Totnes grammar school (1881&#150;4) and Marlborough College (1884&#150;90). He was an awkward, ungainly, and short-sighted boy with a dislike for all forms of organized games which he retained throughout his life: his schooldays were unhappy, nor did he achieve any distinction in the classroom. He did, however, acquire a taste for botany which enriched his later life. From school he went to King's College, London, to train as an electrical engineer. In 1892, before completing his course, he became apprenticed to Cromptons, a firm of electrical engineers, at Chelmsford. He did not find engineering congenial and these years in lonely lodgings were not happy. As the result of a temporary interest in theosophy, he characteristically determined to teach himself Sanskrit; he continued to read Greek and Latin classics, learned a good deal of Italian and some German, and even started upon Icelandic, Irish, and Finnish.<br>
<br>After the death of his father in 1896 and that of his mother in the following year, a small legacy enabled Dawkins to forsake the engineering profession and enter Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1898 at the age of twenty-six. He was a self-taught scholar without the customary grooming in Latin and Greek, but he was fortunate to find himself in the hands of Peter Giles and James Adam. In 1899 the college gave him a scholarship, in 1901 he was placed in the third division of the first class of part one of the classical tripos, in 1902 he obtained a first class with distinction in part two, and an honourable mention in the examination for the Chancellor's medals, and a Craven studentship. In 1904 he became a fellow (and in 1922 an honorary fellow) of Emmanuel College.<br>
<br>Dawkins had first been admitted to the British School at Athens in 1902, during which time he held a Craven studentship. He toured the Greek islands including Karpathos, pursuing his philological interest and in particular the study of Greek dialects. For two years he was in charge of Robert Carr Bosanquet's excavations in eastern Crete at Palaikastro (1904&#150;5). In 1906 he was appointed director of the British School, and was responsible for four seasons of excavations at Sparta, work initiated by his predecessor Bosanquet just before his resignation. This work set a new standard in methods of excavation for Greece, but the outbreak of war delayed publication; <span class="italic">Artemis Orthia</span>, published by the Hellenic Society, did not appear until 1929. Dawkins, who had hoped to initiate a major excavation at Knidos on the Turkish mainland, conducted a further stratigraphic excavation at Phylakopi on Melos in 1911, a site previously explored by the British School. Further fieldwork was carried out on Crete which included excavation at the Kamares cave (1913). His other achievement from this time at Athens was the book <span class="italic">Modern Greek in Asia Minor</span> (1916), a study of the curious dialects of Greek spoken by the inhabitants of the Cappadocian plateau, mainly researched in three journeys in 1909, 1910, and 1911.<br>
<br>In 1914 Dawkins resigned the directorship of the British School at Athens; a very substantial legacy from his mother's cousin, J. A. Doyle, who died in 1907, had given him financial independence. The inheritance included a Victorian house, Plas Dulas in Denbighshire, which may have been the inspiration for Llanabba in Evelyn Waugh's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall</span> (1928); an Oxford rumour suggested that Dawkins had additionally inherited a pack of foxhounds. The outbreak of war saw him at Trebizond. Dawkins returned to Wales and in the early months of the war he noted in a letter to one of the fellows at Emmanuel that he was drilling with what he termed &#145;the local volunteer corps of old gentlemen&#146;. After six months in censorship at the British legation in Athens, he served from 1916 to 1919 as an intelligence officer, with the rank of temporary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, in eastern Crete, an area well known to him from his days at Palaikastro. His commission was delayed as he insisted on retaining his moustache. In a letter to P. W. Wood, one of the fellows at Emmanuel, Dawkins wrote of how he suffered from seasickness, and how one night in a storm he had been thrown from his hammock onto the deck; but he added, &#145;I must not grumble&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1920 Dawkins was appointed to the Bywater and Sotheby chair of Byzantine and modern Greek in the University of Oxford and in 1922 Exeter College made him a fellow. Before he was elected to a fellowship he was greatly supported by John Myres, who as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer had delivered Dawkins to Crete from Athens. His major work during his tenure of the chair was a translation with commentary of the medieval Cypriot <span class="italic">Chronicle of Makhairas</span> (2 vols., 1932) which records the history of the Lusignan dynasty between 1359 and 1432. In 1939 when he retired under the age limit Exeter College made him an honorary fellow with rooms in college. To the end of his life he kept his zest and interest in young people and he was to generations of Oxford undergraduates a source of real education. He was to act as the senior member of the Hypocrites' Club in Oxford during the 1920s. Osbert Lancaster records, in his lively account of Dawkins in <span class="italic">With an Eye to the Future</span> (1967), the incident when cackling laughter drew attention to Dawkins perched in a chestnut tree within Exeter College. Except for music, for which he had no ear, his tastes were catholic: he knew about plants, pictures, and European literature.<br>
<br>As a critic, whether of books or men, Dawkins was positive and to the end of his long life, though always intolerant of humbug, enviably receptive to new ideas. He had a wide linguistic knowledge and could talk French, Italian, and modern Greek as rapidly as natives. He knew most parts of the Mediterranean including north Africa and had an unrivalled knowledge at first hand of the Greek-speaking peoples from Pontus in the east to Calabria in the west. In this last period of his life he turned his attention to the subject matter of folk-tales which he had earlier taken down as texts for philological purposes, regularly publishing in <span class="italic">Folklore</span>. In 1926 he was to become a founder member, with J. R. R. Tolkien, of Kolb&iacute;tar. In 1950 he published <span class="italic">Forty-Five Stories from the Dodekanese</span> from manuscripts which had been presented by W. H. D. Rouse to the University of Cambridge. This was followed by <span class="italic">Modern Greek Folktales</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">More Greek Folktales</span> (1955), the importance of which was due to the examination of the relative popularity of and the changes undergone by types of Indo-European folk-tales in a definite and exceptionally well-recorded area. In 1947 he broke his thigh, which as it failed to heal required him to walk with an iron brace and sticks, but this did not diminish his incessant industry. Articles and reviews continued to pour out from his somewhat erratic typewriter and his rooms remained a focus of hospitality for promising young men and congenial seniors. Himself an original, he liked originals. His taste in men as in books was catholic. By no means all his friends were academical and his range of acquaintance extended from Norman Douglas, of whom in 1933 he published a perceptive study, to the egregious Baron Corvo (Frederick William Rolfe). Dawkins fell down dead in Parks Road, Oxford, on 4 May 1955 on a visit to Wadham garden. He never married. He was elected FBA in 1933, proceeded DLitt at Oxford in 1942, and was an honorary DPhil of the universities of Athens (1937) and Salonika (1951). A pencil drawing of Dawkins was made by Henry Lamb, whose sister Dorothy had excavated with Dawkins at Phylakopi in 1911. Dawkins himself is recorded as saying of the image, &#145;The mouth's all wrong. It's the mouth of a liar and a boaster&#146;  (Bowra, 252).<br>
