<span class="headword">Lowther, Sir  Richard</span>  (1532&#150;1608), <span class="occ">landowner and soldier</span>, was born on 14 February 1532 in Hartsop Hall, Westmorland, the eldest of the six children of Hugh Lowther (<i>c</i>.1510&#150;1555) and Dorothy Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1562). She was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5646/', "Henry Clifford, tenth Baron Clifford (1454&#150;1523)")</script>, the Shepherd Lord, and his second wife, Florence. Lowther's ancestors had lived in Lowther, Westmorland, certainly since the twelfth century, and since 1305 at least eight of his direct ancestors had represented Westmorland or Cumberland in parliament, three Lowthers fought at Agincourt, and his grandfather Sir John led his tenantry into battle at Solway Moss and was captain of Carlisle Castle from 1544 until his death in 1553. Lowther was also legitimately descended from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26670/', "William Strickland (d. 1419)")</script>, bishop of Carlisle, whose wife died giving birth to a daughter before he took orders.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Lowther's early years or education; he may have studied law at Lincoln's Inn, but he is not recorded as entering the inn until 1560. When aged twenty he took over the family estates on his grandfather's death, his ne'er-do-well father having been disinherited for his &#145;great unthriftiness&#146;  (Cumbria AS, Carlisle, D/Lons/L3/1/7). In 1553 he married Frances Middleton (<i>d</i>. 1597) of Middleton Hall in south Westmorland; they had eight sons and seven daughters, of whom three sons and five daughters died young. All but the first were born in Lowther Hall.<br>
<br>In 1566 Lowther was pricked sheriff of Cumberland and in the same year Lord Scrope, lord warden of the west march and captain of Carlisle Castle, appointed him his deputy in both posts. On 16 May 1568, Mary, queen of Scots, landed on the Cumberland coast on her escape from Scotland, and she was greeted at Cockermouth the next day by Lowther with a force of 400 horsemen to conduct her to Carlisle. Here she was lodged in the castle &#145;with such entertainment as I well can or am able upon such sudden&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 53/1/2). Four days later the Catholic earl of Northumberland tried to take custody of Mary which, despite the earl's anger, Lowther refused to allow without orders from London. On 27 May Sir Francis Knollys (to whom Queen Elizabeth entrusted Mary's security) and Lord Warden Scrope arrived from London. When Northumberland complained of the treatment he received from Lowther, regarding him as &#145;too mean a man to have such a charge&#146;, he was told that Lowther &#145;did dutifully and wisely and he [Northumberland] had overshot himself very much to the discontentation of Queen Elizabeth&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 59/15; Sharp, 341). Mary for her part thanked Elizabeth &#145;for the good reception I have had in your country, and principally from Mister Lowther who received me with all courtesy&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula C. i, fol. 106<i>v</i>, 28 May). The story in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and elsewhere that Lowther injudiciously permitted the duke of Norfolk to meet Mary and was heavily fined in Star Chamber has no truth in it. Norfolk was in London throughout.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1568 Mary was removed from Carlisle, which was considered too dangerously close to the Scottish border, and taken to Bolton Castle. Knollys chose Lowther Hall for her first night as it &#145;standeth farther from the rescue of the Scots than any other house we could have chosen&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula C. i, fol. 163, 14 July). Lowther family tradition recalled that Mary was deeply touched by the affectionate reverence she received from Lowther and his family and, as Sir William Lowther wrote in 1765, she &#145;knelt down upon the floor and prayed earnestly a blessing on him and his family&#146;  (Cumbria AS, Carlisle, D/Lons/L3/5/155).<br>
<br>In 1569 Lowther, by now receiver of the duke of Norfolk's rents in Cumberland and Westmorland and therefore beholden to him, together with his younger brother Gerard, became involved in the plot (led by the earls of Northumberland and Westmorland and not discouraged by the duke) to depose Elizabeth and supplant her by Mary. Gerard Lowther escaped to Scotland, as did the earls, but Richard was incarcerated in the Tower of London from January to August 1570 with Norfolk and twenty-three other prisoners. In October 1571 he was again in the Tower following the Ridolfi plot, which had the same aims. Norfolk was executed in June 1572 and Lowther was not released until the following January. Apart from the mental anxiety that it induced, his imprisonment appears from his own account to have been relatively comfortable. On both occasions his release from the Tower was suitably celebrated by the arrival of a son about ten months later.<br>
<br>Lowther next came to prominence in 1588 when he was pricked sheriff of Cumberland on the recommendation of the agent of Sir Francis Walsingham&#151;he:<blockquote>had disgrace by the cause of the late Duke of Norfolk, which is a thing common when the master gets a fall &hellip; Yet quit himself very worshipfully of that action &hellip; There is no man in the West Marches so sufficient for Border causes. (BL, Cotton MS Caligula D.i, fol. 315)</blockquote>In 1590 Scrope again appointed him deputy warden of the march. On 4 June 1592, only four days after Scrope's death, Lowther was appointed by the queen to succeed him as lord warden and to assume responsibility for keeping &#145;the country in good order and the laws of the borders towards Scotland duly observed&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/32/34). He was known to be well respected by the Scots and had experience of conducting difficult business with them. He was the first commoner lord warden since 1327; nevertheless he was a stopgap until the new Lord Scrope was appointed the following year. From 1597 to 1601 he was again deputy warden.<br>
<br>In September 1597 Lowther's wife died. He subsequently married Margaret Eden, widow of John Threlkeld, who outlived him. On 17 April 1603 he was knighted at York by James I on his journey south to his new capital, the ninth member of his family to receive the honour, and in the following year he served for the third time as a commissioner for border affairs to negotiate a treaty with the Scots. Of the gentry who played a part in the government of the west march and the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland in Elizabeth's reign, Lowther was probably the most active.<br>
<br>Sir Richard died at Lowther Hall a great-grandfather aged seventy-five on 21 January 1608, and was buried four days later in Lowther church, where there is a monument to him with a full-length effigy. To his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37693/', "Sir John Lowther (1582&#150;1637)")</script>, he was &#145;my memorable grandfather&#151;I have ever given great regard to his sayings&#146;  (Cumbria AS, Carlisle, D/Lons/L3/1/1). Of Sir Richard's five surviving sons, Christopher (1557&#150;1617) commanded Scrope's escort when he greeted King James at Newcastle in 1603 and was knighted by the king; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17107/', "Sir Gerard Lowther (d. 1624)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17108/', "Lowther, Sir Gerard (c.1590&#150;1660)")</script>] was a judge of the common pleas in Ireland; and Sir Lancelot (1571&#150;1638) was solicitor-general to James I's queen, Anne of Denmark, and later a baron of the court of exchequer in Ireland. Sir Richard's descendants are still seated at Lowther.<br>
