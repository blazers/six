<span class="headword">Smith,  George William Quick</span>  (1905&#150;1986), <span class="occ">road transport administrator</span>, was born at 21 Waverley Terrace, Albert Road, Wood Green, London, on 23 August 1905, the eldest son of George Windsor Smith (<i>b</i>. 1879/80), commercial clerk in a firm of provision importers, and his wife, Maud Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Quick (<i>b</i>. 1879/80). For much of his life he was known as Quick Smith. As a child he lived in Palmer's Green, London, but nothing further is known about his early life.<br>
<br>Between 1922 and 1935 Quick Smith held posts in the shipping industry where he gained accountancy and secretarial experience. He was an accountant at the time of his marriage, on 2 June 1934, to Ida Muriel (1902&#150;1990), daughter of Ernest Frederick Tinkler, sculptor. They had no children.<br>
<br>Quick Smith entered the road transport business in 1935, working for the Road Haulage Association. He also was connected with other haulage bodies in the late 1930s, sometimes on a part-time basis. These included the National Conference of Express Carriers, of which he was general secretary. He played an important part in persuading road and rail carriers to agree rates for transporting small parcels. Later he helped to establish the Meat Transport Organization, an agency of the Ministry of Food in the era of rationing. On behalf of the National Road Transport Employers' Federation and then as secretary of the National Road Transport Federation (NRTF), he was a member of delegations to the International Labour Office in Geneva between 1935 and 1948 that helped establish the Bureau International de Transport par Autocar et Camion (International Road Transport Union, as it was known in Britain, from 1948).<br>
<br>By 1939 Quick Smith was a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. Following part-time study while in employment, he obtained an LLB degree from London University and in 1942 was admitted as a pupil to the Inner Temple. When he passed the bar final in 1944, he was secretary to the NRTF, an employers' organization established in 1943, and the standing joint committee of the Road Hauliers national organizations, which dealt with such matters as black-out accidents and fuel rationing. Quick Smith was called to the bar in June 1945 but never practised as a barrister.<br>
<br>For much of his career Quick Smith represented the interests of road haulage operators. Nevertheless, he acquired a reputation of being rather more than an employers' man. On the occasion of his retirement as chief executive of the Transport Holding Company in 1971, the left-wing trades union leader Frank Cousins recalled that some thirty years earlier &#145;QS was the first person I ever met who shot down a proposal from a colleague on the employer's panel with the words: &#147;Oh no, that won't do, it wouldn't be fair&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span>, 20 Aug 1971).<br>
<br>Quick Smith's career took off in the post-war era of nationalized transport. In 1948 he became secretary and legal adviser to the British Transport Executive (BTE), later renamed the British Haulage Executive (BHE) and British Road Services (BRS). In January 1954 he was elevated to the BRS board of management. In co-operation with his chairman, Major-General George Russell, he oversaw the transfer of thousands of private haulage companies and tens of thousands of their vehicles and employees into the public sector. Then, following the return of a Conservative government in 1951, enactment of the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1953, and abolition of the RHE, he was required to denationalize road haulage by transferring the BRS fleet back to private ownership.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his professional background in employers' organizations, Quick Smith was unenthusiastic about wholesale denationalization. In his December 1954 Spurrier lecture to the Institute of Transport he stated that sufficient vehicles had been sold back into private ownership already, that the rest should be left in the hands of BRS to preserve the advantages of large-scale organization, and that road haulage should not be a political football (<span class="italic">Journal of International Transport</span>, 26 (1954&#150;6), 65&#150;76; <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 14 Dec 1954). The <span class="roman">Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act</span>, 1956, which created five limited companies whose shares were held by BRS, provided for a public&#150;private mix consistent with Quick Smith's ideas.<br>
<br>Between 1957 and 1960 Quick Smith was a member of the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel studies group that reported in favour of a tunnel. He left BRS and the Road Haulage executive in 1959 to become adviser (special projects) to the British transport commission, which exercised overall control of nationalized transport. When the commission was abolished by the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1962, he was appointed secretary of the Transport Holding Company (THC), a government-owned body that administered a range of state-owned transport, travel, and engineering companies previously managed by the BTC. In 1969 he was made chief executive. The <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1968, abolished the THC and replaced it with the National Freight Corporation (NFC) which consolidated all remaining parts of nationalized road haulage, including BRS, Pickfords, Freightliners, and National Carriers. Quoted on the London stock exchange it was a public enterprise that competed with private hauliers. Quick Smith was its chief executive and deputy chairman with a salary, by 1971, of &pound;13,000 per annum&#151;a sum sufficient to sustain him at his exclusive address on Hyde Park Gate, Knightsbridge, where he had moved, from Hove, in the 1950s. At the request of John Peyton, minister of transport industries, he delayed his retirement by six months to assist the transition to a new NFC chairman. Though formally retired from mid-1971 Quick Smith sat on the transport tribunal from 1973 until 1977 and retained directorships with haulage and bus companies.<br>
<br>Quick Smith published much on transport and transport law. Late in life he wrote a history of nationalized road haulage but it was never published. At the Institute of Transport he was a member of council, 1954&#150;7, and vice-president, 1960&#150;62. He was a practising Anglican, and during the 1960s and 1970s was churchwarden at All Saints, Margaret Street, London. He also was a governor and, latterly, vice-president of SPCK, and a trustee of several transport benevolent funds. He was made CBE in 1959 and granted freedom of the City of London. He was master of the Carmen's Company in 1967&#150;8. Quick Smith's hobbies were reading, writing, and the arts. Towards the end of his life, when he moved to Poole, Dorset, he belonged to the Royal Motor Yacht Club. He died of pneumonia at Poole General Hospital on 15 July 1986. Following a requiem mass at St Stephen's Church, Bournemouth, on 22 July, his body was cremated.<br>
<br>Though he professed to hate bureaucracy and committee work, Quick Smith was &#145;the consummate bureaucrat&#146; who spent much of his professional life in committee rooms  (<span class="italic">Companion to British Road Haulage History</span>). He was a quiet and private man but a persuasive negotiator who rose from a modest background to become &#145;one of the most influential figures&#146; in Britain's post-war nationalized transport industry  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 July 1986). In the process, he acquired vast experience of administration and transport law and intimate knowledge of the attitudes and aspirations of transport operators, civil servants, trade union officials, and politicians. He has been accused of inconsistency of principle in switching from champion of private enterprise to defender of nationalization and back again in less than a decade  (<span class="italic">Companion to British Road Haulage History</span>). This is to oversimplify; whoever employed him and whatever ideology prevailed in Westminster, Quick Smith's priority was to advance the interests of road haulage.<br>
