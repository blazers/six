<span class="headword">Wickes,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1698, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">goldsmith</span>, was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and baptized there on 7 July 1698, the fifth of the six sons and the eighth of ten children of James Wickes, upholsterer, of Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Dorothy Burton. No record exists of his education: he may have attended the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds or a charity school in nearby Hawstead maintained by a kinsman, Sir Dudley Cullum, who became his brother-in-law in 1710.<br>
<br>Wickes was apprenticed on 2 December 1712 to Samuel Wastell, a London goldsmith, and made free of the Goldsmiths' Company by service on 16 June 1720. By 3 February 1722, when he registered his first maker's marks at Goldsmiths' Hall, he had set up in Threadneedle Street, a move made possible by his marriage on 9 January 1722 to Alder (<i>d</i>. 1774), wealthy daughter of Samuel Phelpes, gentleman merchant, and his wife, Mary Aldworth, descendant of merchant princes linked with the East India Company and the Society of Merchant Adventurers of Bristol.<br>
<br>In the early 1730s Wickes joined John Craig, jeweller, in Norris Street, Haymarket. The partnership was dissolved in June 1735 when he was appointed goldsmith to Frederick Louis, prince of Wales, and moved to Panton Street. He was made a liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company on 13 March 1740. His ledgers, housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the only eighteenth-century working goldsmith's ledgers extant, date from 1735. They record purchases by clients, among them Sir Robert Walpole and Robert Butts, bishop of Ely, first cousin to Wickes's mother. This prodigious output engendered a network of subcontractors.<br>
<br>Wickes's own <i>oeuvre</i>, lacking perhaps the soaring inspiration of Paul De Lamerie or Paul Crespin, nevertheless places him in the first rank. His Bristol ewer and basin of 1736 are two of the most original and historically important pieces of early English rococo silver. The great Leinster dinner service of 1747 was his swansong: no silver bearing his mark appears thereafter. That year he was joined by Edward Wakelin, who took charge of the workshop. He did not take Wakelin into partnership with him: that the childless Wickes reserved for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Samuel Netherton, in 1750. The death of the prince of Wales in March 1751 dashed their hopes of royal preferment.<br>
<br>Wickes retired on 11 October 1760 and was succeeded by his former apprentice John Parker in partnership with Edward Wakelin. Accompanied by his wife and Netherton, he moved to Thurston, Suffolk, where he died on 31 August 1761. He was buried in St Peter's Church, Thurston, where a memorial stone was erected. His firm continued to flourish. Robert Garrard joined it in 1780, followed by three sons: it became known as Garrard, the crown jewellers.<br>
