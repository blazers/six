<span class="headword">Hyde,  Harford Montgomery</span> <span class="st"> [H. Montgomery Hyde]</span>  (1907&#150;1989), <span class="occ">politician and historian</span>, was born on 14 August 1907 at Ranelagh, Malone Road, Belfast, the son of James Johnstone Hyde JP, linen merchant, and his wife, Isobel Greenfield, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Montgomery. He was later very proud of the part played by his family in developing the Ulster linen industry. His great-grandfather, he told the House of Commons, had in the 1840s spent several years in the USA in &#145;a not unsuccessful endeavour to stimulate the export of Irish linen&#146;, and Hyde himself during the First World War spent part of the school holidays in helping to pull flax. From Sedbergh School (1921&#150;5) he went to Queen's University, Belfast, where he graduated in 1928 with a first-class degree in history. Encouraged by J. E. Todd, the professor of history, who &#145;lectured in the grand manner&#146;, he proceeded to Oxford, entering Magdalen College as an exhibitioner, and in 1930 obtained a second-class degree in jurisprudence. A member of the Middle Temple, he was called to the bar in 1934 and practised for a short time on the north-east circuit. He also travelled widely, visiting, among other countries, the Soviet Union. In 1933 he published his first book, <span class="italic">The Early Life of Castlereagh</span>, swiftly followed by <span class="italic">The Russian Journals of Martha and Catherine Wilmot</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">More Letters from Martha Wilmot</span> (1935), both with the marchioness of Londonderry. In 1935 he became librarian and then private secretary to Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, seventh marquess of Londonderry, Conservative politician. Hyde became very attached to the Londonderry family and was the author of several further books on the family and their possessions. On 15 April 1939 he married Dorothy Mabel Brayshaw Crofts (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), daughter of James Murray Crofts, secretary to the joint matriculation board of the northern universities.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the Second World War Hyde worked as a censor in Gibraltar. In 1940 he was commissioned in the intelligence corps and after serving in Bermuda was engaged in counter-espionage work in the United States under Sir William Stephenson, &#145;the quiet Canadian&#146;, whose life he published in 1962. He also described his own war experiences in his lively <span class="italic">Secret Intelligence Agent</span> (1982). In 1944 he was attached to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, and in 1944&#150;5 he worked for the Allied Control Commission for Austria, retiring with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>After short stints as an adviser to Alexander Korda's film company and as an assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Law Reports</span> Hyde was in 1950 elected as Ulster Unionist MP for East Belfast. For ten years he was an energetic back-bencher, concerned especially with the economic development of Northern Ireland. He sat on standing committees dealing with copyright and the Public Record Office and was a member of the United Kingdom delegation to the Council of Europe consultative assembly. On two issues, which cut across party lines, he intervened vigorously: in 1956 he seconded a measure for the abolition of capital punishment, and in 1957 he strongly supported the recommendations of the Wolfenden committee, &#145;a humanitarian document&#146;. Hyde's attitude on these highly controversial issues, together with the feeling that he was not seen often enough in his constituency, contributed to his losing his seat in 1959. The constituency selection committee by a small majority readopted him but the association rejected him at a meeting from which Hyde was absent, being in the West Indies on parliamentary business. After leaving parliament he held, from 1959 to 1961, an academic post as professor of history and political science in the University of the Punjab, Lahore. He and his first wife, Dorothy, were divorced in 1952, and in 1955 he married Mary Eleanor, daughter of Colonel L. G. Fischer, of the Indian Medical Service. This marriage also ended in divorce, in 1966, and on 28 October in the same year he married Rosalind (Rose) Roberts (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), daughter of Commander James Francis William Dimond, naval officer.<br>
<br>Though Hyde practised many avocations, all of which provided him with experience and expertise, he was essentially a man of letters, with a prolific and varied output. His <span class="italic">British Air Policy between the Wars</span> (1976) was a balanced and lucid survey of a complex subject. He produced numerous biographies, his subjects ranging from the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico to Mrs Beeton, and including several eminent lawyers. From his undergraduate days, when he occupied Oscar Wilde's rooms in Magdalen, he was interested in Wilde and built up a valuable collection of Wildeana. He published a life of Wilde (1975), an edition of his trials (1948), a detailed account of his imprisonment and last years (1963), an edition of his plays (1988), and a life of Lord Alfred Douglas (1984). He had an intense, dispassionate interest in the homosexual world. His <span class="italic">The Other Love</span> (1970) was a history of homosexuality in England from the sixteenth century which fused legal knowledge with illustrative anecdotage; and <span class="italic">The Cleveland Street Scandal</span> (1976) was a full and enthralling account of a Victorian <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, involving all levels of society. He also published several works dealing with another secretive world, that of espionage.<br>
<br>Versatility, it is sometimes suggested, implies superficiality. This was certainly not so as regards Hyde. He was diligent, widely and thoroughly read, and assiduous in tracking down manuscript material: when the PRO released files on a subject in which he was interested he was first in the queue. His books were carefully crafted and very readable. Though chained to his desk for long stretches he enjoyed congenial company, conversation, and his clubs. A hospitable host, he encouraged and helped other writers, and was a splendid raconteur and a good listener (two roles which do not always go together). For many years he lived in Rye, where he wrote <span class="italic">Henry James at Home</span> (1969), but in his closing years he lived at Westwell House, Tenterden, Kent. He died at the William Harvey Hospital, Ashford, Kent, of acute pulmonary oedema and ischaemic heart disease on 10 August 1989. He was survived by his third wife, Rosalind, who bequeathed &pound;10,000 to Queen's University, Belfast, to provide an annual Dr Harford Montgomery Hyde award for the top history graduate.<br>
