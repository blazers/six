<span class="headword">Syrett,  Janet <span class="st"> [Netta]</span></span>  (1865&#150;1943), <span class="occ">writer and playwright</span>, was born at 23 Harbour Street, Ramsgate, Kent, on 17 March 1865, the eldest of approximately eleven children born to Ernest Syrett (<i>d</i>. 1906), linen draper, and Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stembridge (<i>d</i>. 1923). She was niece to the writer Grant Allen (1848&#150;1899). Baptized Janet, she was always known as Netta. Until the age of eleven Netta Syrett was educated at home, but in 1877 she was sent to the North London Collegiate School for Girls with her sister Dora, where they boarded with the headmistress Frances Buss. Dora died of tuberculosis in 1881, and Netta left the school at the same time. She was not happy during her time there, and later in her memoir criticized Miss Buss for lacking sympathy with adolescents, and partially blamed her for her sister's death. Over the next few years Syrett learned German, completed the syllabus for the Cambridge higher local examination in one year, and in 1885 attended the Training College for Women Teachers at Cambridge. The family was comfortably off financially and her parents supported their daughters' choice of higher education and careers. When Syrett and four of her sisters were working or studying in London in the 1880s their father acquired a flat for them. Later, when Syrett was suffering from exhaustion and nerves, he funded an extended trip to Italy for her and her sister Nell. (After her father's death in 1906 the family's income was substantially reduced.)<br>
<br>In 1886 Syrett accepted a post as English mistress at Swansea high school, where she stayed for two years. Grant Allen, who influenced her thinking for many years, introduced her to many prominent writers during this period. Her first published story appeared in <span class="italic">Longman's</span> magazine (at Allen's instigation) while she was at Swansea. By 1890 she was the second mistress at the London Polytechnic School for Girls. Here she met Mabel Beardsley, who also taught at the school, and who introduced her to her brother Aubrey Beardsley's circle. Through these connections she contributed to the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. She also started writing plays for children. Written in the &#145;new realist&#146; style, her first novel, <span class="italic">Nobody's Fault</span> (1896), with a book jacket designed by Aubrey Beardsley, was published by John Lane in his <span class="roman">Keynote</span> series. She brought out a children's book, <span class="italic">Garden of Delight</span>, illustrated by her sister Nell (also a contributor to the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>) in 1898.<br>
<br>In 1902 Syrett's play <span class="italic">The Finding of Nancy</span> won a national competition organized by the Playgoers' Club, and was performed as a charity matin&eacute;e for the Actors' Benevolent Fund. The critics' response was enthusiastic, but the subject matter of the play&#151;a respectable single woman enters into a sexual relationship with a married man, whose wife is a dipsomaniac in an asylum&#151;cost Syrett not only a commercial run, but also her job as a private schoolmistress. In the same year she published the novel <span class="italic">Roseanne</span>, in which the heroine destroys a friend's marriage. In 1905 she edited the single volume of a putative juvenile periodical, the <span class="italic">Dream Garden</span>. Contributors included fellow <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> authors and artists. Her subsequent novels, <span class="italic">Women and Circumstance</span> (1906) and <span class="italic">Olivia L. Carew</span> (1910), continued to explore women's concerns. Syrett's children's books included several collections of plays, such as <span class="italic">Old Miracle Plays of England</span> (1911), also illustrated by her sister Nell. She had long been interested in establishing a children's theatre that would play during all the school holidays and offer a range of plays, not just the popular Christmas pantomimes. With her friend and fellow author Mabel Dearmer, she rented a theatre over the Christmas season of 1913. Unfortunately the expenses consumed any profit and the venture seems to have put the final seal on Syrett's bitterness about the theatre.<br>
<br>Syrett wrote thirty-eight novels in all, twenty books for young people, and numerous plays and short stories. Other than the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> she also contributed to many periodicals, including Charlotte M. Yonge's children's magazine, the <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span>. Her later novels reflect many of her own experiences: her attendance at North London Collegiate School for Girls in <span class="italic">The Victorians</span> (1915), her career as a teacher in <span class="italic">The God of Chance</span> (1920), her years in the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> circle in <span class="italic">Strange Marriage</span> (1930), and her travels in Italy and France. One of her most popular novels was <span class="italic">Portrait of a Rebel</span> (1929), whose heroine was a leader in the women's suffrage movement (it was made into a film, <span class="italic">A Woman Rebels</span>, starring Katharine Hepburn, in 1936). Like other feminist authors of the New Woman fiction, Syrett rejected prescribed Victorian gender roles. Her heroines seek financial, psychological, and social independence, striving to combine personal aspirations with romance and domesticity. Her writing also addresses class issues, socialism and the labour movement, and educational reform. Having settled in Surrey, Netta Syrett died on 15 December 1943 of heart failure brought on by pneumonia at Roseacre Nursing Home, Priorsfield Road, Compton, Guildford; she was cremated at Woking on 20 December.<br>
