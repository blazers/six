<span class="headword">Palavicino, Sir  Horatio</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1600), <span class="occ">merchant and diplomat</span>, was born in Genoa, Italy, the second son of Tobias Palavicino (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1580), a well-connected merchant aristocrat, and his wife, Battina (1522&#150;1607), the daughter of Andrea Spinola. The family firm handled the papal monopoly of alum, an essential ingredient in the dyeing process, from the mines at Tolfa from 1566, and Horatio seems to have acted as their agent in Antwerp. When their monopoly expired in 1578 the family sought to undermine the new grantees by buying up alum stocks and negotiating monopoly agreements with the major consumers in England and the Low Countries. The plan backfired in England because of Burghley's anxieties about the consumer and because of attempts by the customs official Thomas Smythe to manipulate the markets himself. In the Low Countries the Palavicini were more successful. In return for a six-year monopoly of alum imports, they loaned stocks of alum worth about &pound;30,000 to the states general, who could sell it to the clothiers for cash to support the war effort. Palavicino was sucked into England's orbit because this loan was underwritten by Queen Elizabeth and the city of London, and in 1581 he took over the share of his Spinola partners. Although the loan was never repaid, the interest payments proved lucrative, and by 1593 (when Elizabeth stopped the interest payments) Palavicino had received &pound;45,479 11<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. During the early 1580s he was based for much of the time in France, where he conducted the family's alum business, but his contacts among the international merchant community made him an invaluable source of intelligence to the English government, and he was used to transmit funds by bills of exchange to prop up the duke of Anjou's campaigns in the Low Countries. Like many in his position, his business interests were very diverse. He undertook the purchase of <i>objets d'art</i> for the great; in 1591 he secured a portion of Sir Edward Stafford's licence for the export of undressed cloths which was sold to merchant adventurers; he had a reputation for speculating in corn in times of dearth; he lent money on a large scale, and in 1585 negotiated the earl of Leicester's loan from city merchants; and in 1592 he handled &pound;24,000-worth of goods from the captured carrack the <i>Madre de Dios</i>.<br>
<br>Palavicino's allegiance to the Roman Catholic church was strained by the pope's arrest and torture of his brother Fabritio, and in 1584 Horatio was himself condemned by the Inquisition in absentia and his goods seized. Although he adopted the language of the godly in his correspondence with Walsingham, describing the pope as the Antichrist, he mixed more easily with the more conservative members of the protestant establishment, such as William Cecil, Lord Burghley, Robert Cecil, Lord Buckhurst, Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury (who acted as godfather to his first son), and Sir William Cornwallis. He was granted letters of denization in November 1585 and was knighted by the queen in November 1587. In 1588, in a demonstration of <i>l'ardore dell'animo mio</i>, he volunteered for service against the armada and wrote a propagandist pamphlet on the campaign. It is probably his talent for self-promotion which accounts for his otherwise inexplicable appearance among the naval commanders commemorated in the armada tapestry presented to the lord admiral by the Dutch government. His close relations with the queen are clear from the fact that in 1589 he was among the sixteen knights to receive new year's gifts of gilt plate from Elizabeth, and the exchange of presents continued through the 1590s.<br>
<br>Palavicino's Anglophilia, his wide contacts in the commercial world, and his possession of courtly graces sufficient to commend him to the snobbish Queen Elizabeth made him an ideal candidate for diplomatic missions. He felt that the key to the neutralization of the Spanish threat lay in France rather than in the Netherlands. From March 1586 until April 1587 he was employed on an embassy to the German princes to persuade them to levy troops to assist Henri of Navarre and to free Henri III from the domination of the Guise and the Catholic league. It was not an easy mission. Elizabeth expected the Germans to pay for an army of 23,000 men in France for an indefinite period for the miserly sum of 50,000 &eacute;cus (then worth &pound;15,468 15<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>.); she underestimated the reluctance of Brandenburg and Saxony to get involved, and she was banking on John Casimir of the Palatinate, whose reliability was in doubt, to act as her cat's-paw. In June 1586 Elizabeth agreed to supply an extra 50,000 &eacute;cus, enabling Palavicino to negotiate the treaty of Fridelsheim in January 1587, by which Casimir agreed to support an army of 9000 in France for three months. However, the expedition was undermined by Elizabeth's claim that she had intended that the extra 50,000 &eacute;cus should be paid only if the Germans provided their share. Palavicino was convinced of the need for a negotiated peace. He put out feelers to Philip II through his brother Fabritio and the Genoese authorities in 1586 and, hoping to exploit the tensions between Philip and his general, wrote to Parma to encourage him to take on the sovereignty of the Netherlands in 1588. But he also recognized the need to negotiate from strength and therefore pressed strongly on the queen the need for intervention in France in 1587&#150;8. Elizabeth rejected his counsel until the dire position of Henri of Navarre after the assassination of Henri III necessitated a rethink. In March 1590 he was sent to negotiate joint action by the German princes in France, but his efforts were undermined by Elizabeth's diversion of her interests to Brittany. Palavicino's diplomatic efforts on a further embassy to Germany beginning in December 1590 bore fruit in the peace of Torgau (February 1591), by which Elizabeth was pledged to pay &pound;15,000 to support the princes' campaign in France. Unfortunately Elizabeth claimed that he had exceeded his instructions by granting &pound;5000 more than she had intended, even though his instructions had left him with discretion to agree to that amount if necessary. Although Robert Cecil turned to him for help in constructing his spy network in 1596, Elizabeth's fury over the German embassy of 1590&#150;91 ensured that his diplomatic career was over.<br>
<br>Palavicino did not marry until late in life, but it is clear that his sexual energies had found other outlets. In 1578 the governors of Bridewell Hospital in London interviewed one of his servants, who explained how his master had required him to find him some maiden who had not been &#145;meddled with&#146; before. Unable to find one in London, the hapless servant was dispatched with a horse and 10<i>s</i>. to Guildford. It was at about this time that Palavicino's illegitimate son Edward (<i>c</i>.1578&#150;1630) was born. His quest for the hand of Anne, the daughter of the Huguenot leader Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue, was rebuffed in 1588. Three years later, on 27 April 1591, he was married at Frankfurt to Anna Hooftman, the daughter of the Antwerp banker Gieles van Eychelberg, alias Hooftman. The marriage was not entirely happy, as Anna was inclined to melancholy, doubtless not helped by the dull Cambridgeshire society to which she was condemned, but there were three children, Henry (1592&#150;1615), Toby (1593&#150;<i>c</i>.1644), and Baptina (1594&#150;1618).<br>
<br>In London Palavicino resided in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East (1578&#150;84) and thereafter in a large house outside Bishopsgate. From 1585, however, he began to acquire property in the countryside, and purchased the manors of Cranbrook and Rayhouse in Essex from the earl of Leicester in 1585, Westacre in Norfolk from Sir Thomas Cecil in 1588, and Babraham and Mompillers in Cambridgeshire from Robert Taylor, the recently ruined teller of the exchequer, in 1589. His total investment in land has been estimated at &pound;20,000. From the early 1590s he regularly resided in the house built by Taylor at Babraham in 1576, but he was never accepted by the Cambridgeshire gentry. His tax assessments in the county became a major cause of friction, as Lord North and his allies sought to make him pay a disproportionate share. Palavicino declared that they acted &#145;upon conceit of riches which are not in substance but in men's talk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 8.282). His subsidy assessment was the highest in the city of London in both 1582 and 1598, and his fortune at his death was estimated to be &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>Palavicino died on 5 July 1600 at Babraham, where he was buried. By his will he left his daughter an annuity of &pound;150 until her marriage, when she was to be given a portion of &pound;5000. Apart from a number of other legacies, the bulk of the estate was to be held in trust to be divided equally between the two sons at marriage. Unfortunately Palavicino decided on his deathbed to remove his hitherto trusted agents, Giovanni Battista Giustiniano and Francisco Rizzo, from the position of executor, and died before he could appoint replacements, leaving his wife as sole executor. She remarried on 7 July 1601, taking as her second husband the heavily indebted Sir Oliver Cromwell of Hinchinbrook, possibly with the encouragement of the overseers of the will, Sir Robert Cecil and Gilbert, earl of Shrewsbury, who did nothing to remove the Lady Anne from the executorship on her remarriage as Palavicino had instructed. Cromwell managed the extraordinary feat of marrying his two daughters Catherine and Jane to Henry and Toby Palavicino on 24 April 1606, and later marrying his eldest son, Henry, to Baptina, so that there was no way in which the Palavicino fortune could not fall into the Cromwell family's hands. Sir Oliver's reckless extravagance was matched by that of his son-in-law Toby, who succeeded to the estates on his elder brother's death in 1615. A prodigious builder and gambler, he wasted his assets, fell into the toils of the London moneylenders, disentailed his estates by private act in 1624, and in the years which followed sold them off.<br>
