<span class="headword">Etheridge,  John Wesley</span>  (1804&#150;1866), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and Semitic scholar</span>, was born at Youngwoods, a farmhouse near Newport, Isle of Wight, on 24 February 1804. His father was a Methodist local preacher and had been urged by Wesley to enter the itinerant ministry, but refused. His mother was Alley Gray, daughter of a naval officer. As a youth Etheridge was thoughtful and studious. He was privately educated and began to preach in 1826. Towards the end of 1827 the president of the conference sent him to Hull to assist Dr Joseph Beaumont, whose health had broken down. At the Bristol conference in August 1831 Etheridge was received into full connexion, being then second minister in the Brighton circuit. During that year he married Eliza Middleton. They had a daughter who, under her father's teaching, became a remarkable Hebrew scholar and linguist. He took delight in the sacred literature and languages of the East, and most of his works related to these subjects. During several years of indifferent health he lived in Devon, Guernsey, and then France, where he availed himself of the libraries for carrying on his favourite studies, and helped in the missions at Paris and Boulogne. He wrote extensively on the history and writings of the Syriac churches, revealing an impressive knowledge of the Jewish, biblical, and rabbinic literature of the early Christian era. The University of Heidelberg in 1847 conferred upon him the degree of PhD in recognition of his exact scholarship and contributions to learning.<br>
<br>Etheridge resumed circuit work on his recovery to health in 1846 and laboured successfully in Bristol, Leeds, and London. From 1853 he served in the Cornwall district at Penzance, Truro, Falmouth, St Austell, and Camborne. During this period he completed official biographies of two key figures in Methodism, Adam Clarke (1858) and Thomas Coke (1860). Etheridge died at Camborne on 24 May 1866, leaving an unpublished biography of John Fletcher in manuscript form.<br>
