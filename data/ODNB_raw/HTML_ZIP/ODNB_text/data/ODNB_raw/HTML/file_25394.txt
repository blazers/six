<span class="headword">Sherwin,  Ralph</span>  (1799&#150;1830), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 3 April 1799 at Bishop Auckland, co. Durham. He received a basic education in his birthplace, and subsequently went to school in Witton-le-Wear. For five years he studied medicine in London and Edinburgh, but soon became acquainted with Yates of Covent Garden and was inspired to take to the stage. His first appearance was made in York in July 1818, under Mansell, in the role of Dandie Dinmont in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>. He remained in the York company for two years, acting in Leeds, Hull, and Sheffield. He then went to Birmingham, under Alfred Bunn, and lost his wardrobe when the theatre was burnt down. At Brighton, under Brunton, he played low comedy and old men. He later rejoined Bunn at Leicester, and appeared in the newly erected theatre in Birmingham. On 14 February 1823, as Sherwin from York, he made his d&eacute;but at Drury Lane, playing Dandie Dinmont in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span> once again. He was engaged for three years, and acted the part of Robin in <span class="italic">No Song No Supper</span>, Paddock in <span class="italic">My Spouse and I</span>, and Diggory Delph in <span class="italic">Family Jars</span>, among others. In 1825 he was the original Shock, a very poor shepherd, in Joseph Lunn's adaptation <span class="italic">The Shepherd of Derwent Vale, or, The Innocent Culprit</span>, Sam Sharpset in <span class="italic">The Slave</span>, to W. C. Macready's Gambia, and Russet in George Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>. Few opportunities were given him, however, and he played mainly in minor roles. At the end of the three years he was not re-engaged, irregular habits being the reputed cause of his dismissal. He then took to driving a stage-coach, which he upset, but did return for a short time to the stage. Sherwin had a fine face and figure, expressive features, and a smooth and powerful voice. He was a good mimic, could sketch likenesses with remarkable fidelity, and was an efficient representative of Yorkshire characters. He died in 1830, in Durham, at his father's house.<br>
