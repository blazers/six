<span class="headword">Payne,  John Wesley Vivian <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1899&#150;1969), <span class="occ">bandleader</span>, was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 22 August 1899, the only son of John Edwin Payne, music warehouse manager, and his wife, Sarah Vivian Clare Gunn, of 10 Church Street, Leamington Spa. Jack Payne, as he was always known, first became interested in dance music during his service with the Royal Flying Corps in 1918, playing the piano in various amateur bands in the service. After demobilization he took up dance music as a profession and formed a small band which secured a position in the Hotel Cecil in London in the summer of 1925. With this he made his first records for Zonophone and Aco. When the BBC began relaying dance music from the hotel, four extra musicians were added, increasing the number to ten. In February 1928 Payne was appointed director of dance music to the BBC, a position he held from 2 March 1928 until 14 March 1932. In that period he and the BBC Dance Orchestra recorded exclusively for Columbia, and made daily broadcasts of about an hour from Station 2LO, later known as the National Programme. He was the first bandleader to introduce and close each broadcast with a signature tune, in this case Irving Berlin's &#145;Say it with Music&#146;, and was one of the first to announce his music and sing the vocal refrains himself. In April 1930 Jack Payne and the BBC Dance Orchestra appeared at the London Palladium, and they returned there in August 1931. The full strength of the band was then sixteen, and it remained so for many years.<br>
<br>On leaving the BBC Payne took his band on nationwide tours, recording for Imperial Records; the labels showed his portrait in place of the gold crown trademark, and a gold facsimile of his signature. He is the only dance-bandleader in the UK to have been accorded this honour. Late in 1932 he and the band appeared as the central figures in a film called <span class="italic">Say it with Music</span>, for which his arranger, Ray Noble, wrote the score. Towards the end of 1933 the band was reorganized, and continued to record on Rex Records, which had replaced Imperial as the principal product of the Crystalate Gramophone Record Manufacturing Company. At the end of 1935 Payne and his band made another film, <span class="italic">Sunshine Ahead</span>, on completion of which they visited South Africa very successfully during the summer of 1936.<br>
<br>In May 1937 Payne gave the members of his band two weeks' notice, and retired to his Buckinghamshire farm to concentrate on stock breeding; but he returned to the popular-music business in January 1938, and resumed recording (for Decca) and touring. During the Second World War he and the band entertained the services extensively, but within a year of the end of the war Payne again withdrew from the scene and became a very popular disc jockey, a host on his own television show, an artists' manager, and, finally, the manager of a hotel in Tonbridge. The last venture was not a success, and failing health and financial difficulties contributed to his death at the age of seventy.<br>
<br>Payne was also a composer. In 1930 he published two waltz ballads which were very successful&#151;&#145;Blue Pacific Moonlight&#146; and &#145;Underneath the Spanish Stars&#146;&#151;and in 1931 another waltz, &#145;Pagan Serenade&#146;, among other numbers. His band was versatile, and in the course of a single show would play all kinds of popular tunes of the day, mostly romantic but freely intermixed with rousing chorus songs in <sup>6</sup>/<sub>8</sub> time, <i>paso dobles</i>, pieces with African-American rhythms, comedy songs involving cameo sketches in which Payne himself would play cockney, north country, American, and Oxford-English character parts, and sometimes concert arrangements of standard classics, one of the most popular being Ravel's <span class="italic">Bolero</span>. One of Payne's most spectacular pieces of showmanship was to simulate a huge engine, appearing to be running out of the stage backdrop into the stalls of the London Palladium, with the members of the band seated on various parts of the engine as they played a popular instrumental number of the time (1931) called <span class="italic">Choo Choo</span>.<br>
<br>Payne was a perfectionist, a disciplinarian, an obvious leader, frank and sincere to a fault. These characteristics did not always find favour with his associates, but he left an indelible mark on the pages of the history of British dance music. He was twice married: first in 1923 to Doris Aileen (<i>d</i>. 1939), the daughter of Colonel H. H. Pengree, Royal Field Artillery; and second in 1942 to Peggy, daughter of Thomas Andrew Cochrane LLB (Edinburgh). A daughter was adopted in the second marriage. Payne died at his home in Tonbridge, Kent, on 4 December 1969.<br>
