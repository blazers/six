<span class="headword">Fison family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1750&#150;1985), <span class="occ">millers and manufacturers of fertilizers and pharmaceuticals</span>, traces its origins to James [i] Fison (1735&#150;1806), who was born at Langham, near Bury St Edmunds, on 1 February 1735, the youngest child of Robert and Dorothy Fison. By the age of fifteen James was an orphan, and he used a small legacy from his mother to learn the baker's craft and set up in business at Barningham, some 6 miles to the north, where he reputedly built up a large trade in the surrounding area. On 25 November 1757 he married Ann Cornell, who had five children before her death in 1773. James never remarried. His business prospered and he diversified into both farming and milling, and was joined in business by his two sons, James [ii] (1761&#150;1817) and Joseph [i] (1765&#150;1808), and his two sons-in-law. James [i] became an ardent Methodist in the 1780s and was soon nicknamed throughout the county as the Methodist baker of Barningham. On 21 December 1784 James [ii] married Sarah (1762&#150;1838), the daughter of John Sparham, from whom his father had rented his first mill. They had seven children, including James [iii] (1785&#150;1844) and William Lorimer (1788&#150;1833), all of whom helped in the business as soon as they were old enough. In 1789 James [ii] opened a &#145;moltons&#146; or maltings at Barningham to supply the rapidly expanding brewing trade. James [i] Fison died in 1806, a wealthy man with property in several villages around Barningham.<br>
<br>Shortly after his father's death James [ii] left two of his sons, Sparham (1786&#150;<i>c</i>.1850) and Thomas (1790&#150;1846), to manage the Barningham business while he himself purchased maltings at Thetford in Norfolk, which he managed with the help of his eldest son, James [iii]. His third son, William Lorimer, moved with his uncle Joseph to Stowmarket, where the family purchased a mill, maltings, and warehouse for storing malt awaiting shipment to London. After the death of Joseph [i] in 1808 the now large family enterprise was left in the hands of James [ii], who immediately took his sons into partnership in the firm of James Fison &amp; Sons. By 1815 the family owned five maltings in Norfolk, three in Thetford, and two 5 miles down the Little Ouse at Brandon. Guided by James [iii] it diversified into dealing in grain, seed, cattle cake, salt, wool, and coals, with business connections stretching as far as the Yorkshire woollen towns and Liverpool.<br>
<br>On the death of James [ii] in 1817 the business was split between the brothers, with James Fison &amp; Sons of Thetford being controlled by James [iii], William Lorimer, and Cornell (1793&#150;1894). They quickly developed an enormous trade along the east coast and, using canal links, across to the west of Scotland, in linseed, rape seed, cattle cake, and grass seed imported from France, Germany, and the Low Countries. Cornell Fison, who spoke both Dutch and French, travelled regularly to the continent to negotiate contracts. By the 1820s the firm was importing large consignments of wheat from the Baltic ports for customers as far away as south Wales, and it had developed a special relationship for the supply of malt with Whitbread &amp; Co., one of the largest London brewers. In 1826 it took the bold step of converting the Barningham mills to steam power, and in 1831 it took over the management of the Whitbread maltings at Whittington between Downham Market and Thetford. By this time the enterprise was one of the largest in East Anglia.<br>
<br>James [iii], who married Mary Baker about 1815, had seven children including one son, Edward (<i>b</i>. 1820), who became a Wesleyan minister. Sparham had no children; but William Lorimer, who about 1814 married Deborah Prentice (<i>d</i>. 1833), had eight children, including <a name="cosubject_50682"></a><span class="headword">Joseph [ii] Fison</span>  (1819&#150;1878)<span class="occ"></span>. The next brother, Thomas, who married Mary Matthew, daughter of John Gostling of Cotton on 28 November 1811, had seventeen children. Two of their sons, Thomas Sparham and William (1820&#150;1900), moved to Bradford to act as wool merchants for James Fison, and subsequently William went into the woollen trade in partnership with William Edward Foster. Their fourteenth son was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33148/', "Revd Lorimer Fison (1832&#150;1907)")</script>. William Lorimer and his wife both died of typhoid in the spring of 1833, leaving six young sons. The second son, Joseph [ii], after his education managed his father's business and began milling on his own account at Stoke Mill at Ipswich in 1842. This new venture prospered and he soon began malting and making bricks and tiles. He built the large Eastern Union Mills in Ipswich. At the same time his relatives in James Fison &amp; Sons were experimenting with the production of the newly discovered fertilizer superphosphate, made by mixing crushed bones and sulphuric acid. James [iii] Fison died in 1844 and from then on there was no direct relationship between James Fison &amp; Sons and the Stowmarket and Ipswich enterprises.<br>
<br>Joseph [ii] Fison started selling fertilizer in the mid-1850s and opened his own works at Bramford, outside Ipswich, in 1858. In 1864 he took his sons <a name="cosubject_50681"></a><span class="headword">James Oliver Fison</span>  (1845&#150;1920)<span class="occ"></span> and (Edward) Herbert (1846&#150;1931) into partnership in the firm of Joseph Fison &amp; Sons, by then the largest flour-milling concern in Suffolk. With British agriculture in depression, Joseph Fison &amp; Sons began exporting fertilizer in the 1880s and also started selling fertilizers directly to farmers and nurseries at home. They stopped distributing simple superphosphates and concentrated on compounds designed to benefit specific crops. During the First World War, in common with the rest of the industry, the firm's output was controlled by the food production department and later the Ministry of Munitions. James Oliver's eldest son, (James Frederick) Lorimer Fison, after education at Charterhouse School and a brilliant undergraduate career at Christ Church, Oxford, entered the family business in 1913, bringing flair and vigour to the marketing department. During the war he distinguished himself at the front, winning the Military Cross in 1916 for &#145;conspicuous bravery&#146;. He rose to the rank of captain, but died of pneumonia at Bluegates after a gas attack in 1917. James Oliver was so devastated by his death that he was forced to hand over the chairmanship of the business to his brother, (Edward) Herbert.<br>
<br>James Oliver's second son, <a name="cosubject_50683"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Francis Guy) Clavering Fison</span>  (1892&#150;1985)<span class="occ"></span>, also educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, had intended a career in medicine, before being called up in the Suffolk yeomanry and then transferring to the Royal Air Force Training Corps for officers. Reluctantly he joined the family business, in 1920, and he quickly became effectively the managing director. As the inter-war recession took hold he ruthlessly cut costs, in 1923 closing the fertilizer plant at Bramford and buying superphosphates from the Netherlands; he also sold the flour-milling business. By the late 1920s he was convinced of the need to rationalize the whole industry, and in 1929 Joseph Fison &amp; Co., Packard and James Fison (Thetford) Ltd, and Prentice Brothers of Stowmarket merged to form Fison, Packard, and Prentice, bringing together firms that, with the exception of Packards, had very close family links. Recognizing the threat from the newly formed Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Clavering began rapidly to expand the business by buying up small fertilizer concerns throughout the United Kingdom; he supervised the take-over of thirty-two concerns between 1929 and 1945. His skill in making acquisitions earned him the sobriquet in the trade of the Wise Man of the East. The manufacturing base of the company was strengthened with the construction of new factories at Ipswich and Avonmouth. In 1937 Clavering took the important decision to build a synthetic-nitrogen plant at Flixborough, near Scunthorpe, to make the company independent of ICI for the supplies of nitrogen. By 1939 Fisons was supplying some 30 per cent of the UK fertilizer market. In 1942 the group was renamed simply Fisons.<br>
<br>Although fertilizers continued to dominate Fisons' business, the take-over of the Anglo-Continental Guano Works Ltd in 1937 had brought with it Genatosan Ltd of Loughborough, a manufacturer of drugs, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and scientific apparatus. After the Second World War, Clavering Fison fostered diversification of the company into these areas, setting up a chemical and biological division. In 1947 Genatosan was merged with Bengers Ltd, and the following year Gland Suppliers was absorbed. Clavering also placed emphasis on product development, and in 1945 began a research and development department; in 1953 Pest Control Ltd was purchased and the Levington research station was established outside Ipswich. In 1957 Clavering retired as chairman, becoming life president, and received a knighthood for his service to agriculture. In that year the sales of the Fisons group totalled &pound;54,512,000, on which the profit before tax was &pound;2,710,000. Clavering was succeeded as chairman by Jim Turner, Lord Netherthorpe.<br>
<br>Sir Clavering Fison's style of management during his forty years at the helm had become increasingly autocratic as he won the respect of the fertilizer industry. He had a flair for choosing businesses to buy and had the temperament and judgement to push through a policy of rationalization. He also chose his lieutenants wisely, attracting men whose administrative and technical skills could weld the companies he had purchased into a successful group. Although he saw the need to diversify after the war, his ventures in pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments provided only the foundations for later developments.<br>
<br>Apart from his business activities Sir Clavering farmed 400 acres at Stutton Park, Suffolk, which gave him first-hand knowledge of the customers' side of the fertilizer business. A lifelong Conservative, he was elected MP for Woodbridge in 1929, but he resigned in 1931 owing to pressure of work. He stood again in 1945, but was defeated in the Labour landslide. He was a keen shot and salmon fisher, and an outstanding tennis player, competing at Wimbledon in 1914 and 1920. On 23 February 1922 he married Evelyn Alice Mary (1901/2&#150;1985), daughter of Francis Lawrence Bland and a great-niece of Elizabeth Fry. They had two daughters. Sir Clavering Fison died on 13 April 1985, and his wife died a few weeks later.<br>
<br>Such an enduring network of family enterprise, spanning two centuries and a variety of products, is not uncommon; but only rarely has it reached such a pinnacle of achievement.<br>
