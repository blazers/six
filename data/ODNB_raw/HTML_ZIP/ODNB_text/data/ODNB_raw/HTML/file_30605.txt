<span class="headword">Barnes, Sir  Kenneth Ralph</span>  (1878&#150;1957), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the youngest child of the Revd Reginald Henry Barnes (<i>d</i>. 1889), vicar of Heavitree, Devon, and prebendary of Exeter Cathedral, and his wife, Frances Mary Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nation. He was born at the vicarage on 11 September 1878, and grew up within a close, richly talented family of six. Two of his sisters became the celebrated West End actresses <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36624/', "Violet Vanbrugh")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36623/', "Irene Vanbrugh")</script>; another sister, Angela, became a professional musician; and his brother Reginald a distinguished and much decorated officer of hussars. In 1885 ill health obliged his father to relinquish his parish, and the entire family moved to west London, enabling young Kenneth to acquire a taste for theatre by seeing spectacular pantomime at Drury Lane, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show at Earls Court, and, at the Lyceum, what he later called the &#145;hypnotic&#146; acting of Henry Irving.<br>
<br>Barnes was educated at Westminster School (1891&#150;5) and, from January 1897, at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), and did just enough work to gain an indifferent pass degree in 1899. He led a comfortable middle-class existence&#151;notwithstanding his father's death when he was eleven and his mother's subsequent remarriage&#151;and indulged a penchant for foreign travel with tours of France, the Low Countries, and Germany (where he came under the operatic spell of Wagner) and a six-month visit to India. Footloose on leaving university, he was offered a clerkship at the Land Registry, a secure but undemanding post which allowed him to reside in London with ample leisure to enjoy membership of the Garrick Club, cricket at Lord's, and free passes at any theatre for the asking. He resigned after a few years in order to become a freelance writer and journalist, earnestly drafting plays, contributing dramatic criticism to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and other newspapers, and making an English adaptation of Paul Hervieu's Parisian success <span class="italic">Connais-toi</span> (ultimately produced as <span class="italic">Glass Houses</span> at the Globe in 1910) for his brother-in-law, the actor&#150;manager Arthur Bourchier.<br>
<br>On the strength of these modest accomplishments and a recommendation from his other theatrical brother-in-law, Dion Boucicault the younger, Barnes was invited in September 1909 to take charge of the school of acting which had been founded by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's five years earlier but which was now languishing for want of effective management. Expected by many to preside over its demise, he contrived to breathe new life into it. By regularizing audition procedures, maximizing fee income, and introducing progress-related student scholarships, he soon restored the venture's artistic and economic health, and then acquired the house and garden adjacent to its Gower Street premises to provide room for future expansion and the construction of a theatre for public performances fronting on Malet Street. In 1913 Barnes oversaw the incorporation of the Academy of Dramatic Art as a limited liability company. Further initiatives were interrupted by the outbreak of war, when, as an ex-territorial officer, he volunteered for duty. In 1915 he was commissioned in the Hampshire regiment, with which he served in India, the Middle East, and, after the armistice, in Siberia in support of the White Russian counter-revolution. Fortunate enough to escape armed combat, he devoted his energies to organizing garrison concert parties and dramatic performances, among them short plays of his own and an &#145;allegorical masque&#146; on the theme of war&#151;morale-boosting exercises for which he was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Barnes returned home in December 1919 to find the academy undersubscribed and again in financial difficulties. He set about remedying the situation, while raising additional money to complete the theatre, which had been left unfinished in 1914, and which was eventually opened by the Prince of Wales in May 1921. Other significant achievements under his administration between the wars included the award of a royal charter in 1920 and the acquisition by the newly dignified Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) of protective privileges already enjoyed by London's chartered music colleges&#151;namely the allocation of an annual grant-in-aid from the Treasury, the ratification of charitable status (with consequential remission of income tax), and, most contentiously, the legal recognition of acting as a &#145;fine art&#146; for the purposes of exemption from payment of the general rate. In 1923 Barnes collaborated with the Central School of Speech and Drama in launching a university diploma in dramatic art under the aegis of London University.<br>
<br>Barnes's next imperative was to fund the demolition of his existing, and inadequate, teaching accommodation and its replacement by a customized new building, opened in November 1931 by the duchess of York. She agreed to become the academy's patron and maintained a continuing interest in its welfare both as queen and as queen mother. In 1938 Barnes initiated a tradition of Shakespearian performances by his students to audiences of London schoolchildren. In the same year, at the instance of George Bernard Shaw, a firm friend and generous benefactor, he was knighted for services to the stage. During the Second World War, while acting as general secretary to the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), he resolutely kept the academy open, despite the destruction of its theatre in an air raid in April 1941. Thanks to his establishment of a post-war rebuilding fund&#151;swelled by the proceeds from all-star matin&eacute;es in the West End and donations he solicited from friends and colleagues&#151;a new, better equipped theatre was completed in December 1954, the academy's jubilee year. It was named the Vanbrugh Theatre in memory of his actress sisters, who had done much to ensure the survival of the entire undertaking.<br>
<br>Barnes's dedication to the affairs of RADA left little room for outside activities, though he served on the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) and several committees connected with the theatre, and had two further plays performed: <span class="italic">Undercurrents</span> by a club of RADA alumni in 1921 and <span class="italic">The Letter of the Law</span> at the Fulham Grand in 1924. On 12 December 1925 he married Daphne Graham (<i>b</i>. 1903), daughter of Sir Richard James Graham, fourth baronet; she had been a student of his, and acted professionally as Mary Sheridan. After his retirement in August 1955 at the age of seventy-six, a bronze bust of Barnes by Clemence Dane was installed in the entrance hall at Gower Street, and he had time to complete an illuminating autobiography, published posthumously in 1958 under the title of <span class="italic">Welcome, Good Friends</span>, before dying at his home, Spring Tide, Kingston Gorse, Sussex, on 16 October 1957. He was buried six days later at St Mary's, Hurley, near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He was survived by his wife, but was predeceased by their son Michael, whose untimely death at twenty-five had been a grievous loss.<br>
<br>Barnes clearly saw the development of RADA as his life's work, pursuing it with exemplary single-mindedness, tenacity, and commitment to his students' spiritual as well as professional well-being. The disadvantage of his relative lack of theatrical experience was offset by a sustaining religious faith and his profound belief in acting as a vocation rather than simply a career. His ready access to people of influence within the aristocracy, his university circle, and the theatre itself enabled him to advance the academy's cause and to give it a high public profile. These influential contacts, while attracting allegations that he was running a finishing school for the socially privileged and ignoring genuine, raw talent, helped the academy to overcome the opposition it had initially encountered from the acting profession. Barnes thus left behind an institution sturdy enough to meet the demands of more radical successors and of a changing theatrical climate.<br>
