<span class="headword">Clopton,  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1440&#150;1496), <span class="occ">merchant, mayor of London, and civil benefactor</span>, was the younger son of John and Agnes Clopton, of Clopton, near Stratford upon Avon, where the family had been settled since the thirteenth century. Apprenticed to John Roo, mercer of London, in 1456/7, he became a member of the company in 1463/4, serving as warden in 1479, 1484, and 1488. He was elected alderman for Dowgate ward on 15 October 1485, and had moved to Bread Street by 1495. He was elected sheriff of London in 1486, and mayor in 1491. After serving with the delegation sent by Edward IV to Archduke Maximilian in Flanders in 1482, he was also elected one of four members for the City of London in the parliament which sat from 20 January to 18 February 1483. Contrary to previous assertions, Clopton was never knighted, describing himself in his will as &#145;citizen, mercer and alderman&#146;  (Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, ER 1/121).<br>
<br>Although he made his career in London and abroad as mercer, stapler, and venturer, Clopton retained close links with Stratford upon Avon, where he built a &#145;praty howse of brike and tymbar&#146;, later known as New Place and purchased in 1597 by William Shakespeare. Leland also credits him with the building of the stone bridge over the river at Stratford which still bears his name, replacing &#145;The bridge ther of late tyme &hellip; very smaulle and ille, and at hygh waters very harde to passe by&#146;  (<span class="italic">Itinerary</span>, 2.49). He is also said to have repaired and improved the highway from London near Aylesbury. Hugh Clopton died, unmarried, in London on 15 September 1496 and was buried, according to his directions, in the chapel of St Katherine in the church of St Margaret's, Lothbury.<br>
<br>Clopton made two wills, one dated 8 March 1496 and enrolled in the husting court of London, and the other dated 14 September 1496 and proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 14 February 1497. The wills provided, in addition to conventional pious bequests to the poor and to religious houses in and around London and Warwickshire, 200 marks for the marriage of twenty poor maidens in London and the same number in Stratford. Clopton also endowed three exhibitions for five years for poor scholars at Oxford, and the same at Cambridge; and ensured the completion of building work&#151;the nave, tower, and porch&#151;at the chapel of the Guild of the Holy Cross, Stratford, for which &#145;of late I have bargayned with oon Dowland and divers other masons&#146;  (Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, ER 1/121). The amount bequeathed for this work is unspecified, but a sum of &pound;50 was also left towards the building of a cross aisle in the parish church of Holy Trinity, Stratford. His regular travels between London and Stratford may be deduced from his bequests towards the &#145;repayring and amending of perilous bridges and weyes within the space of x myles of Stratford upon Avon&#146;  (Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, ER 1/121), and the fact that, at the time of his election as mayor of London, he was &#145;nowe in Warwickshire&#146; when the Mercers' Company determined that twenty-four of their number should meet and escort him the last 10 miles into the city  (Lyell and Watney, 220). Total financial bequests and provisions came to more than &pound;1700 and in addition real estate was devised in Stratford and Wilmcote in Warwickshire and at Calais in France. The separately enrolled husting will bequeathed a freehold tenement in Bow Lane, Vintry, to Whittington College, for the benefit of the testator's soul, with a request that preference should be given to a graduate of Oxford for any vacancy in the mastership. The inquisition <i>post mortem</i>, taken at Stratford on 1 November 1497, specifies nine properties in Stratford upon Avon, together with the manors of Little Wilmcote and Clopton, which he may have held as guardian of his great-nephew William, whose father, John, son of Thomas, Hugh's elder brother, had died in 1486. The wardship of William was granted in 1498 to Hugh Clopton's executors. William, aged fifteen in 1497, was served heir to his great-uncle on 20 July 1504.<br>
