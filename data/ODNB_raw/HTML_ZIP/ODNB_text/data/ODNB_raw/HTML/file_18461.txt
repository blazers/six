<span class="headword">Mayo,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1695), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was the son of Richard Mayo (<i>d</i>. 1660) of St Giles Cripplegate, London. His father was said to be a man of some property, and Richard was educated in London under the puritan Thomas Singleton. On 2 December 1652, after serving a few months as ship's chaplain aboard the <i>Sovereign</i> and perhaps attending Wadham College, Oxford, Mayo was ordained by the fourth London classis as lecturer at Whitechapel. By the time of his marriage to Jane Smyth (<i>d</i>. 1713&times;15), of St Mary, Somerset, in January 1654, Mayo had begun to officiate at Kingston, Surrey, in the absence of the vicar, Dr Edmund Staunton, whom the parliamentary visitors had appointed president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1648. Staunton eventually resigned the living to Mayo in 1658. His ministry at Kingston, long a hotbed of radical agitation, was not without its trials. While he succeeded in having the Quaker missionary Edward Burrough imprisoned and fined &pound;100 for slander in 1658, Burrough and his supporters published two pamphlets decrying Mayo's &#145;damnable doctrine&#146;, and denouncing the &#145;priest's&#146; cruelty in prosecuting him &#145;for speaking the truth&#146; (Cooke, 8; Burrough, 5, 3).<br>
<br>Following his ejection for nonconformity in 1662 Mayo continued to preach in conventicles. In 1669, according to episcopal returns, he preached not only at Kingston, but at Guildford, &#145;to sometimes one-hundred Anabaptists&#146;, and at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, to former &#145;officers and soldiers in the parliamentary army&#146;  (Gordon, 310&#150;11). In April 1672 he obtained a licence as presbyterian teacher at Kingston but by the early 1680s he had settled in Upper Thames Street, London, as pastor of a presbyterian congregation. About 1689 his people built him a new meeting-house in Salters' Hall Court. An advocate of the &#145;Happy Union&#146; (1691) between city Independents and presbyterians, Mayo served as one of the original managers of the Common Fund, which supported deserving candidates for the ministry, and himself contributed &pound;100 to the fund in 1690. When the union collapsed in 1694, the presbyterians John Howe, William Bates, Vincent Alsop, and Daniel Williams withdrew from the merchants' lecture at Pinners' Hall and set up their own at Salters' Hall, to which Samuel Annesley and Mayo were added.<br>
<br>In the midst of this rancour Mayo urged dissenters to seek peace in two sermons, published as <span class="italic">The Cause and Cure of Strife and Division</span> (1695). But he had first established his reputation as an author three decades earlier, with his best-selling <span class="italic">Plain Answer</span> (1664), which encouraged readers to attend to the &#145;neglected duty of secret prayer&#146;. He offered practical &#145;hints&#146; so that Christians would go to prayer &#145;not as sick persons to their meals, because they must&#146;, but with a suitably &#145;quickened and enlarged heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plain Answer</span>, foreword). Under the initials N. H., Mayo published <span class="italic">A Conference betwixt a Papist and a Jew</span> (1673) and <span class="italic">Two Conferences</span> (1677); the latter enjoyed at least six editions, that of 1754 bearing the title <span class="italic">Two Disputations Concerning the Messiah</span>. In both Mayo argued that the Church of Rome, with its &#145;lying wonders and feigned miracles&#146;, gave a &#145;stab to the Christian Faith&#146; by discrediting the best evidence that Jesus was the Messiah, the miracles he and his immediate followers performed  (<span class="italic">Two Conferences</span>, 1679, 28). His <span class="italic">Life</span> of his predecessor, Edmund Staunton, (1673), was reprinted in Clarke's <span class="italic">Lives</span> (1683). In addition to several sermons published in the <span class="italic">Morning-Exercise</span> collections, Mayo also wrote the commentary on <span class="roman">Romans</span> in Matthew Poole's <span class="italic">Annotations</span> (1683&#150;5).<br>
<br>Mayo and his wife, Jane, had six children. Of their three sons the eldest, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1661), became vicar of Great Kimble, Buckinghamshire, through the patronage of the presbyterian Richard Hampden. Mayo's youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18454/', "Daniel Mayo (1672&#150;1733)")</script>, was pastor of his father's congregation in Kingston and of the Gravel-Pit meeting in Hackney, Middlesex. After a six-week illness, Richard Mayo died on 8 September 1695 and was buried three days later on 11 September at Kingston. His assistant, Nathanael Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1702), preached his funeral sermon, in which he stated that Mayo was about sixty-five on his death. He left property worth almost &pound;1000 to his wife and children.<br>
