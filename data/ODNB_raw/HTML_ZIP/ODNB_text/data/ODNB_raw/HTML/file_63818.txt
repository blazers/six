<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ansell,  Gertrude Mary</span>  (1861&#150;1932), <span class="occ">suffragette and businesswoman</span>, was born on 2 June 1861 at 1 Vernon Place, Bloomsbury, London, the third child and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/571/', "George Frederick Ansell (1826&#150;1880)")</script> and his wife, Sarah Cook. Her father, a scientific chemist, had in 1856 been appointed to a clerkship in the Royal Mint with a brief to eliminate waste and mismanagement. Despite his success he was forced in 1868 to give up his position, in circumstances worthy of treatment by Trollope. Ansell has left a full record of the problems, his solutions, and his downfall  (G. F. Ansell, appendices). He died in 1880 leaving his family ill-provided and in 1881 Gertrude Ansell was working in a telephone office. By 1900 she had set up in business as a &#145;typewriter&#146;.<br>
<br>From her own brief memoir it would appear that Gertrude Ansell's thinking was dominated by the welfare of animals and the need to enfranchise women. She acted in the interests of the former by becoming, by 1909, honorary treasurer of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society and one of the organizers of that year's International Anti-Vivisection and Animal Protection Congress. Ansell had become convinced that the economic position of women would never be satisfactory without political freedom. In December 1906 she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the militant suffrage society led by Mrs Pankhurst, and on 13 February 1907 took part in demonstrations surrounding the WSPU's women's parliament in Caxton Hall. On 13 October 1908 she was arrested after taking part in a WSPU &#145;raid&#146; on the House of Commons and was sentenced to a month's imprisonment in Holloway. In her speech, made at the breakfast given to celebrate her release from prison  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 26 Nov 1908, 154), Gertrude Ansell's veneration of Mrs Pankhurst is clear.<br>
<br>Although during the next five years Gertrude Ansell took part in all the major WSPU spectacles, she had given an undertaking to one of her animal committees to abstain from further active militancy. However, in the summer of 1913 the <span class="roman">Dogs Exemption Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Plumage Bill</span>, two acts for which she had been working, were defeated in the House of Commons and she was released from her promise. On 31 July she smashed a window at the Home Office and was sentenced to a month's imprisonment. She immediately went on a hunger and thirst strike and was released under the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span>. She escaped rearrest, although she can hardly be said to have been in hiding, because she was recaptured on 30 October while selling <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, the WSPU newspaper, at Holborn tube station. The criminal record office had circulated her photograph and description (5 feet 4 inches, grey eyes, hair turning grey) as a &#145;Known Militant Suffragette&#146;. There followed a pattern of arrest, imprisonment, hunger and thirst strike, leading to release and escape until on 12 May 1914 she smashed Herkomer's picture of the duke of Wellington in the Royal Academy and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. This time she was not released and, because she carried on with her hunger and thirst strike, was forcibly fed.<br>
<br>Ansell was finally released on 10 August, under the amnesty accorded to suffragette prisoners on the outbreak of war, having been forcibly fed 236 times. There is no record of how her family reacted to her militancy. One of her brothers had become a barrister and later published a history of the family name (J. E. Ansell, <span class="italic">Ansell: History of the Name, 1086 to about 1600</span>, 1929; <span class="italic">Ansell: History of the Name &hellip; Completed</span>, 1933). It was to his children that Gertrude Ansell left her small estate, noting in her will, a businesswoman to the last, that &#145;I am hoping to get my investments settled into good securities before I die &hellip; It is my habit to keep everything paid up.&#146; Gertrude Ansell died at the General Hospital at Saffron Walden on 7 March 1932 following an operation for gallstones.<br>
