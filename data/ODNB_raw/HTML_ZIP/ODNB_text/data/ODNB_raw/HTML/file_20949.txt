<span class="headword">Oughton, Sir  (James) Adolphus Dickenson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">army officer and antiquary</span>, was baptized at St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, on 27 October 1719, the illegitimate son of Colonel <a name="cosubject_53605"></a><span class="headword">Sir Adolphus Oughton</span>, baronet  (1684/5&#150;1736), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, and Miss Frances Dickenson (<i>b</i>. 1697) of St Giles-in-the-Fields. In his early years he was known as James Adolphus Dickenson. His father was the son of Adolphus Oughton (<i>d</i>. 1684) of Fillongley, Warwickshire, and Great Harborough, Leicestershire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Richard Samwell of Upton, Northamptonshire. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 19 March 1702, aged seventeen. He entered the Middle Temple in 1703, but did not follow a legal career. Oughton served under Marlborough at Blenheim in 1705 and was commissioned captain and lieutenant-colonel in the 1st foot guards in 1706, seeing further action at Oudenarde in 1708. About 1712 he married his cousin Frances Bagot (<i>d</i>. 1714), daughter of his mother's sister Frances and her husband, Sir Thomas Wagstaffe, and widow of Sir Edward Bagot. That year he accompanied Marlborough into exile, but he returned in 1714 at the accession of George I, when he became groom of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales (afterwards George II). He inherited a lease of twenty-five years on an estate in Bishop's Tachbrook in Warwickshire on his wife's death in 1714, and later married Elizabeth, daughter of John Baber and his wife, Mary Draper.<br>
<br>Oughton was promoted colonel and appointed first major of the Coldstream Guards in 1715, the year in which he was elected member of parliament for Coventry. In 1717 he was appointed regimental lieutenant-colonel of the Coldstream. He continued to support the ministry following the breach between George I and his son that year, and resigned from the prince's household in December; in 1718 he received a secret service payment of &pound;500 from the government, and on 27 August he was created a baronet. Re-elected for Coventry in 1722 (after fighting a duel with William, third Baron Craven, brother of his opponent Fulwar Craven), Oughton remained a prominent ministerialist and senior army officer, serving in Ireland between 1729 and 1733. His ambition to be governor of Minorca may have been thwarted by his ambivalence on the excise question, where the militant opposition of his Coventry constituents to the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> led him to abstain rather than vote with Walpole's government. He was none the less appointed colonel of the 8th dragoons in 1733, and was again elected for Coventry in 1734. He became a brigadier-general in 1735, but died at Bishop's Tachbrook on 4 September 1736. He was a freemason and had something of a reputation as a rake.<br>
<br>The young Dickenson grew up on his father's estate at Bishop's Tachbrook, and attended Coventry grammar school from 1725 until 1729, after which he went to Charterhouse School until 1735, where he excelled in the classics. His place at Charterhouse was secured for him through the influence of Frederick, prince of Wales, a friend of his father and fellow freemason. Initially destined for an exhibition at Christ Church, Oxford, he instead attended Trinity College, Dublin, in 1736 and 1737. His father's death in 1736 removed his sole source of financial support, necessitated his departure from Trinity, and prompted him to seek a military career. In 1737 he was commissioned cornet in the 8th dragoons, of which his father had been colonel and which was then stationed in Ireland; he purchased a lieutenancy in 1741, the year he started to use his father's surname. Two of his abiding interests began while he was a subaltern: he became a freemason in London in 1737 and developed a passion for antiquities while serving in Ireland in the late 1730s.<br>
<br>The army's enlargement in 1742 provided Oughton with his captaincy, in the 37th regiment of foot, and that year he went to Flanders with his regiment, taking the opportunity to visit Rhineland cities, record antiquities, and collect medals. After returning to Britain in 1746 for the suppression of the Jacobite rising, he saw action at the battle of Falkirk and fought as a major of brigade at Culloden, being elected secretary of the Cumberland Society, which was formed in Inverness in April 1746. He experienced his third battle, Laffeldt, in 1747 as the 37th's major and was promoted, without purchase, to the regiment's lieutenant-colonelcy in 1749. Commanding the regiment on Minorca between 1749 and 1754 he acted as the island's provincial grand master mason and indulged his fondness for travel, visiting Algiers and spending several months in Italy in 1752&#151;during which visit he acted as witness at Sir William Chambers's marriage in Rome and took copious notes on the Arsenale in Venice.<br>
<br>Stationed in Scotland in 1754 and 1755, Oughton met and in the latter year married the widowed mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7049/', "Hew Whitefoord Dalrymple (1750&#150;1830)")</script>, Mary Dalrymple, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ross (<i>d</i>. 1793). He also joined Edinburgh's Select Society and Revolution Society before returning to England in 1756 and taking the 1st battalion of his regiment to Flanders in 1758. On his return to Britain in 1759, following his command of the 37th at the battle of Minden, Oughton was rewarded with the colonelcy of the 55th regiment of foot; he was also left &pound;1000 in the will of General James Wolfe. He settled in Bolton Street, Piccadilly, for the next eight years and, while militarily unemployed in London, Oughton was elected to its Society of Arts in 1762 and its Society of Antiquaries in 1767. At a time when many Britons were equivocal about the Hanoverian dynasty Oughton lost no opportunity to proclaim his allegiance to the protestant succession: among his other societal memberships were those of the Blew and Orange Society and the Antigallican Society. In 1762 he was promoted from the colonelcy of the 55th to that of the 31st regiment of foot. As colonel of the 31st he had and exercised such opportunities for patronage within his regiment that he became well known in the army not only for ensuring that officers were promoted within his regiment but also for supporting and sponsoring officers of slender means but great potential.<br>
<br>Oughton returned to Scotland in 1767 with the rank of major-general to fill the post of deputy to the commander-in-chief, north Britain, John Campbell, marquess of Lorne (later fifth duke of Argyll). His final promotion, to the rank of lieutenant-general, came in 1770 and he succeeded Lorne as commander-in-chief in 1778, having been created KB in 1773 and appointed to the sinecure post of lieutenant-governor of Antigua in 1772. The majority of his final thirteen years of life in Scotland were ones of uxorious tranquillity. With the nation at peace until 1775 Oughton was largely free to follow his own interests and he passed the time in learning Gaelic, in tours of inspection, in socializing in Edinburgh, and in active freemasonry, being elected grand master of the Scottish grand lodge in 1769 and 1770 and to the masonic royal order of Scotland in 1769. During his time in Scotland Oughton met both James Boswell and Samuel Johnson: Johnson's description of Oughton as &#145;a very extraordinary man; a man of boundless curiosity and unwearied diligence&#146;  (Boswell, 567) remains the best description of this remarkable military paragon. As the war in America intensified after 1778 so Oughton's workload increased. This undoubtedly affected his health and probably contributed to his early death, which occurred in Bath on 14 April 1780. He was buried in Bath Abbey two days later and a memorial tablet was erected in Westminster Abbey in 1781.<br>
