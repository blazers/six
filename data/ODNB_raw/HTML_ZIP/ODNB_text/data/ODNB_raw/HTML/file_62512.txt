<span class="headword">Bhave, Vinoba</span>  (1895&#150;1982), <span class="occ">spiritual leader in India</span>, was born Vinayak Narhari Bhave on 11 September 1895, the eldest of the five children (four brothers, one sister) of a Maharashtrian Brahman family in the village of Gagoda, Kolaba district, Bombay. His father, Narhari Shambhurao Bhave, an industrial chemist in the Buckingham mills, Baroda, and later a civil servant in the state, inculcated in Vinoba (as he became known) a commitment to science. By far the greater influences were his pious mother, Rukmini Devi, and his grandfather Shambhurao, an inandar and ayurvedic physician who ran his own village temple. Possibly his mother's dominant influence explains why all three surviving sons chose celibacy. In 1909 Vinoba joined his father in Baroda, where he received his education in Baroda School. He admired contemporary and historical examples of patriotism, such as western India's B. G. Tilak and the Italian Mazzini, and fell under the spell above all of the Maharashtrian saints, and of Shankara. In March 1916, abandoning his intermediate examination in Bombay, he chose to go to the holy Hindu city of Benares to study Sanskrit and philosophy. Gandhi's notorious speech at the laying of the foundation stone of Benares Hindu University profoundly influenced him, and in June 1916, aged twenty, he joined Gandhi in his ashram (community) in Ahmadabad, Gujarat.<br>
<br>Until Gandhi's assassination in January 1948 Vinoba worked out of the limelight with total dedication in the fields of social reconstruction and education. He opened a new ashram in Wardha, central India, in July 1921. Khadi, the hand-spun cloth which was one hallmark of Gandhi's politics, became his obsession.<br>
<br>In December 1932 Vinoba opened another ashram in the village of Nalwadi, 2 miles from Wardha, and gave more of his time to the plight of the &#145;untouchables&#146; at the base of Hindu society, travelling widely through the villages of the locality. In 1938, to recover from ill health, he moved to an empty bungalow belonging to Jamnalal Bajaj, a wealthy supporter of Gandhi, in the village of Paunar, set on a mound above the River Dham in central India. This, the Paramdham ashram, was to remain his home until his death. Vinoba did not see Gandhi as his guru (spiritual guide) and insisted that one should pursue one's own ideals. But Gandhi, recognizing Vinoba's application of his ideals, saw him as a son. He selected him as the first to initiate individual non-violent opposition to the war; the resulting prison sentence troubled Vinoba little as he was disciplined by the austerity of ashram life. He came to be seen as Gandhi's spiritual heir as Nehru inherited the role of political leadership.<br>
<br>After Gandhi's assassination in 1948 Vinoba began the second phase of his life as the charismatic leader of a Gandhian inspired non-violent revolution, the Sarvodaya movement. In 1951 he found his vocation as the apostle of <i>bhoodan</i>, the free gift of land, an answer to landlessness and an alternative to violent socio-economic change. So began an extraordinary personal pilgrimage in which Vinoba walked the length and breadth of India, some 44,000 miles, returning to Paunar only in April 1964. In time the more individualist character of <i>bhoodan</i> gave way to the more socialist <i>gramdan</i>, the gifting of a whole village. But the gap between this ideal and reality was always huge; for example, the land gifted was often uncultivable. As the movement lost momentum in the 1960s, Vinoba was forced to compromise. He agreed to a <i>sulabh</i> (simplified) <i>gram</i>, whereby the landowner granted all his land to the village, but retained one-twentieth and never surrendered rights of inheritance. When almost the whole of the state of Bihar was seemingly incorporated in the movement by 1969, Vinoba announced his retirement. However, Bihar's subsequent history, and the plight of the lowest in society, cast doubt on the long-term efficacy of such non-violent and voluntary strategies for radical change.<br>
<br>Vinoba's Achilles heel was politics. He claimed to stand for a decentralized self-governing society, and, like Gandhi, affirmed that, with restraint, there would be no need for government. He claimed to reject the politics of power and stand for a partyless democracy, though significantly one based on consensus rather than majority rule. Yet he was always close to Nehru and came to look on his daughter, Indira Gandhi, as his own niece. Vinoba believed that structural change was almost incidental to a change in ethical outlook, to a transformation of values. But the rank and file of the post-Gandhian Sarvodaya movement for the welfare of all were driven by a genuine wish for structural change on behalf of the landless, and under the alternative leadership of J. P. Narayan were ready to engage in active confrontation with what they saw as a corrupt social and political system.<br>
<br>So began the third and least happy phase of Vinoba's career. Narayan, among others, challenged Indira Gandhi's dictatorial politics, and she responded with the imposition of an emergency regime in July 1975, which lasted for two years. Vinoba may have staved off a split in the Sarvodaya movement, but it was cosmetic. He screened the rift by undertaking a year-long vow of silence on 25 December 1975. When he did pronounce on the emergency, in writing in July, he did so in terms of its being an era of discipline, <i>anushasan parva</i>, seemingly sanctioning its repressiveness and earning himself the sobriquet &#145;the Saint of the Emergency&#146;. His &#145;fast unto death&#146; against cow slaughter in September 1976 can only disingenuously be seen as a challenge to Mrs Gandhi to return to democracy. She courted his support throughout, bribing him with promises of a nationwide celebration of the silver jubilee of the Sarvodaya movement and promising to step up distribution of land to the landless.<br>
<br>Vinoba can all too easily be portrayed as the cerebral Brahman, given his pedantry with words and his obsessive fascination with mathematics. His best-known writing was a commentary on the <span class="italic">Bhagavad gita</span>, first delivered in Dhulia gaol in 1932. The concept of desireless action, so prominent in this sacred text, underpinned his life's work. He feared for India's security, setting up the <i>shanti sena</i>, a kind of non-violent police force, as an answer to internal threats from communalism and external challenges from Pakistan and China. Himself a brilliant linguist, he championed the use of the Devanagari script, in which Hindi is written, for all the vernacular languages as a further means of strengthening Indian unity, despite the passionate concern for regional vernacular evident in India after independence. He saw himself as driven by compassion, by a politics of love, but there was in his life, as in that of Gandhi, that other &#145;saint&#146; in Indian politics, a seemingly contradictory combination of self-punitive austerity and a genuine, almost maternal, search for the moral well-being of others.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1982 Vinoba had a heart attack. With characteristic physical detachment, he went on a fast and, in a manner appropriate for a modern saint, calmly prepared for death; this came at the Paramdham ashram on 15 November. He was cremated the following day on the banks of the River Dham, close to the Gandhi memorial. His ashes were placed in his <i>babakuti</i> (hut) at the ashram.<br>
