<span class="headword">Harwood,  Francis</span>  (1726/7&#150;1783), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, worked primarily in Italy. Of his place of birth and his parents, nothing is known. At Easter 1752, when he was twenty-five, he was living at the Palazzo Zuccari, Rome. In Rome he shared accommodation with Sir Joshua Reynolds and Simon Vierpyl. In the following year he was working with the sculptor Joseph Wilton in Florence. He was admitted to the Florentine Academy on 12 January 1755 as a &#145;pittore Inglese&#146; but he matriculated as a &#145;scultore&#146;. There is evidence that soon afterwards Harwood worked with Giovanni Battista Piamontini (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1690) in a studio near Santissima Annunziata. In 1758 both sculptors were among those contracted to decorate Porta San Gallo, where Harwood's statue <span class="italic">Equity</span> was installed the following year. After Piamontini's death Harwood acquired his studio. Before long his stock in trade was to provide the grand tourist market with copies after the antique; Lord Northampton was among the first to buy a selection. Using more imagination, Harwood sculpted a bust of Cromwell (1759) and a black person (1758; Getty Museum, Malibu, California), which shows exceptional ability. In 1767 he carved an elaborate monument showing Virtue pointing to heaven and to a cherub holding a portrait medallion of William, second Earl Cowper (Hertingfordbury church, Hertfordshire).<br>
<br>In 1768 Thomas Patch made an etching of Harwood which endorses his reputation as &#145;a drunken Englishman&#146; and in the following year, writing to Thomas Banks, Joseph Nollekens described him as &#145;knocking the marbil about like feway &amp; belive he has got more work to do than any One Sculptor in England&#146;  (Whitley, 41). He was able to meet the growing demand for his work by employing Pietro Pisani (whom he also taught), Pietro Bastianelli, and Niccol&ograve; Kindermann as assistants, and his work shows a consequent reduction in quality. From the late 1760s his output began to include garnitures and chimney-pieces. There are records of Harwood providing vases and other items for Charles Townley (1768), Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1768), the earl of Shelburne (1772), and Sir John Griffin Griffin (1772; Audley End, Essex). He also provided chimney-pieces for Pietro Leopold II (Salone Celesti, Palazzo Pitti, Florence), Catherine the Great (Tsarskoye Selo, near St Petersburg), and Patrick Home (1774&#150;5; Wedderburn Castle, Berwickshire). Others were made after designs by George Dance for Sir William Mainwaring (<i>c</i>.1761; Peover Hall, Cheshire) and, after a design by Sir William Chambers, for the earl of Charlemont (1768; Casino, Dublin). Sir Lawrence Dundas commissioned both fireplaces and other objects (1768&#150;9; Aske Hall, Yorkshire). In 1776 Harwood contributed one of the copies of a Harpy after Giambologna for the Isolotto in the Boboli Gardens, Florence. By 1779 Harwood's success was envied by the young Canova, who remarked on the large number of assistants in his studio and his extensive stock of plaster models, materials, and sculpture. Harwood converted to Catholicism shortly before his death in Florence in December 1783.<br>
