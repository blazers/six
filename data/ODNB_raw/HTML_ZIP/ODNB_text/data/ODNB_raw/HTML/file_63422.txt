<span class="headword">Barclay,  William</span>  (1603&#150;1676), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Siggot, Scotland. Although he was the son of the laird of Siggot, his parents' identity remains unknown beyond that. He entered Swedish military service some time during the Thirty Years' War (the exact date is unclear) and earned promotion to the rank of colonel. In 1646 he was listed as the colonel and chief of a cavalry squadron from V&auml;rmland and Dalarna.<br>
<br>Barclay may have returned to Scotland in 1642 for a short visit, and this was also when he first became involved in a lengthy battle to get a debt settled by the Swedish government. Barclay was to feature in a series of disputes after this, none of which harmed his standing in Swedish society. The following year a land donation was authorized for him and in 1645 the Riksr&aring;d (Swedish state council) ordered that Barclay's debt be settled. In 1645 he married Margareta Becker, the widow of another Scot in Swedish service, Patrick Kinnemond, who had been ennobled posthumously. They had four sons and one daughter. Soon Barclay found himself again in trouble with the Swedish authorities. He was convicted by a Swedish war tribunal of excessive plundering during the German campaigns and lost his colonelcy in 1648 as a result. However, this did not prove an obstacle to his ennoblement that same year. Barclay then served as major of the city militia in Stockholm in 1652 and actively sought admission to the house of nobility. Queen Kristina yielded to his entreaties by formally introducing him into the house in 1654, but she denied his requests for further land donations. Barclay's continued social power was again demonstrated two years later when the Stockholm town council chose him in preference to another officer for promotion to city colonel. Later that year he was also chosen to receive Queen Kristina as a city representative when she returned from Prussia. Before long Barclay became embroiled once more in a conflict with the Riksr&aring;d, on this occasion over a dispute with the master of court, whom he blamed for not undertaking his duties properly; and in the following year, Barclay, always controversial, upset the chief governor of Stockholm by raising a matter with the military college without discussing it first with the governor.<br>
<br>For all his various altercations, Barclay overcame these setbacks and remained in royal favour, being appointed a commissioner for conscription for the Swedish army in 1657. Later that year he was involved in yet another quarrel, this one between Stockholm's military defence corps and the burgesses of the city. Like many officers of the time, Barclay continued to seek his overdue wages. Although he was receiving at least 500 Swedish riksdaler a year from Stockholm city (another source gives the figure as 750 daler) his royal wages for earlier military service had still not been paid, and Barclay threatened resignation from the army unless they were. The situation was resolved by 1665 as he was then promoted major-general. Barclay died in Stockholm in 1676, but it appears that his estates were not passed on to his sons.<br>
