<span class="headword">Massey,  Eyre</span>, first Baron Clarina  (1719&#150;1804), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 24 May 1719, was the sixth son of Colonel Hugh Massey of Duntrileague, co. Limerick, and his wife, Elizabeth, the fourth daughter of George Evans, father of George, first Baron Carbery. His eldest brother, an MP and office-holder in Ireland, was Hugh, first Baron Massy. In a &#145;Memorial&#146; of his services he stated that he &#145;purchased a pair of colours&#146; in the 27th foot in 1739, and went with them to the West Indies as lieutenant of the grenadiers. The 27th foot, of which General William Blakeney 
    (later Baron Blakeney; 1672&#150;1761)
   was colonel, was at Admiral Edward Vernon's capture of the port and treasure of Porto Bello (on the north side of the isthmus of Darien) in 1739, and the few survivors returned home in December 1740. The dates of Massey's commissions in the 27th foot as ensign were 25 January 1741 and 3 November 1741. He served with his regiment against the Jacobites in Scotland in 1745&#150;6, and was wounded at the battle of Culloden (16 April 1746). He was made captain-lieutenant and captain in the regiment by William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, apparently in 1747, captain on 24 May 1751, and major on 10 December 1755. In 1757 he went to North America as a major in the 46th foot, of which he became lieutenant-colonel in 1758, and in summer 1759 he commanded the regiment in the expedition against the French Fort Niagara, succeeding to the command of the king's troops after Brigadier-General John Prideaux was accidentally killed by a British mortar shell on 19 July. Massey stated in his &#145;Memorial&#146; that, as Sir William Johnson (1715&#150;1774) was in command of a large force of American Indians, who were lukewarm in the British cause, he waived the chief command in favour of Johnson. Massey commanded in the action at La Belle Famille (24 July 1759), where, with 500 of the 46th and some Indians and New York provincials, he ambushed and routed the relief force of 1800 French regulars and French Canadians together with 500 of the Five Nations Indians; almost all the French officers were killed or captured. This action took place in view of Fort Niagara, which surrendered that day, leaving the whole Upper Ohio region in British hands. According to Massey's &#145;Memorial&#146;, this was the first time American Indians had been defeated in the war. At his request Massey was transferred to his old regiment, the 27th (Inniskilling) regiment, and in 1760 he commanded the grenadiers of the army in James Wolfe's advance on Montreal. He commanded a battalion of grenadiers at the capture of Martinique in 1761 and at the conquest of Havana in 1762, though he was wounded several times. Massey commanded the 27th at New York, Quebec, and Montreal from 1763 to 1769, and afterwards in Ireland, and was its colonel from 19 February 1773 until his death. On 27 December 1767 Massey married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1815), the daughter of Nathaniel Clements and the sister of Robert Clements, first earl of Leitrim; they had two sons and two daughters. Massey went to Nova Scotia in 1776 and commanded the troops at Halifax for four years. He was promoted major-general in 1777, and later he commanded at Cork. In 1782 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and he was reportedly marshal of the army in Ireland.<br>
<br>For many years Massey appears to have remained unemployed. In letters to General Sir John Vaughan about 1793&#150;4 he wrote about his disappointments in not obtaining a command (as lieutenant-general), and he regarded as heartbreaking the appointment by George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, first marquess of Buckingham, the lord lieutenant, of &#145;Popish children&#146; (Master Talbot, aged eight, Master Skerritt, aged nine, and others), to ensigncies in his regiment. The carrying of the standards taken at Martinique in 1794 in state to St Paul's angered him: &#145;We had no such honours paid to our noble and brave commander, General Monckton!&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2137). From 1794 until promoted full general in 1796 he held the Cork command. It was a critical one, with, among other problems, the difficulties with new regiments, which the government persisted in &#145;drafting&#146; against their recruiting engagements. He quelled a potentially serious mutiny of 2000 of these young troops at Spike Island, Cork Harbour, in 1795. Massey was MP for Swords, co. Dublin (1790&#150;97), and governor of Limerick (1797&#150;1804) and of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. In a letter to William Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, dated 9 November 1800, Charles, first Marquess Cornwallis stated that Massey had &#145;most strongly urged upon him&#146; that his wife should be made a peeress in her own right, as a reward for his own &#145;long and faithful services as a soldier and his zealous loyalty as a subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.301). Massey was raised to the Irish peerage on 27 December 1800 as Baron Clarina, of Elm Park, co. Limerick; his was one of nine peerages conferred on commoners on the last day of such creations before the union with Great Britain. He died at his residence in Bath, Somerset, on 17 May 1804, and was buried at Bath Abbey on 24 May. He was succeeded by his second and only surviving son, Nathaniel William Massey (1773&#150;1810), army officer. His widow, Catherine, died on 27 January 1815, aged seventy-one.<br>
