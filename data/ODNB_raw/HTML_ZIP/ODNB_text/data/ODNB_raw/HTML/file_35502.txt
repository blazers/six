<span class="headword">Phear, Sir  John Budd</span>  (1825&#150;1905), <span class="occ">judge in India and author</span>, was born at Earl Stonham, Suffolk, on 9 February 1825, the eldest son of John Phear (1794&#150;1869), fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and rector of Earl Stonham from 1823 to 1869, and his wife, Catherine Wreford, only daughter of Samuel Budd, doctor, of North Tawton, Devon. Of his two brothers, Henry Carylon Phear (1826&#150;1880) was a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and a chancery barrister, and the Revd Samuel George Phear (1829&#150;1918) was master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from 1871 to 1895.<br>
<br>Educated privately by his father, John entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in March 1843 and graduated BA as sixth wrangler in 1847. In April 1847 he was elected a fellow of Clare College and shortly thereafter mathematical lecturer. While at Cambridge he published two textbooks, <span class="italic">Elementary Mechanics</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">Elementary Hydrostatics with Numerous Examples</span> (1852), and in 1856 was moderator of the mathematical tripos. He left Cambridge in 1854, but retained his fellowship until his marriage in 1865. In 1854 Phear was called to the bar by the Inner Temple and joined the western circuit, subsequently transferring himself to the Norfolk circuit. In 1859 he published <span class="italic">A Treatise on Rights of Water</span>, which remained the standard legal text on the topic for many years.<br>
<br>In 1864 Phear was appointed a judge of the high court of Bengal, and on 16 October 1865, at Madras, married the widowed Emily Tabart (<i>d</i>. 1897), daughter of John Bolton of Burnley House, Stockwell, with whom he had two daughters.<br>
<br>As a judge Phear prided himself on his freedom from racial prejudice and was particularly noted for his refusal to trivialize cases of assault brought by Indians against Europeans. In Calcutta's insular Anglo-Indian community such behaviour was soon translated into the perceived sin of &#145;a partiality for the natives&#146;&#151;a view heightened in 1867, when Phear and his wife gave an Indian name to their first-born daughter, Ethel Kamini.<br>
<br>In addition to his judicial duties, Phear was variously president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Bengal Social Science Association, and the Bengal Photographic Society. In particular, as long-term president of the Bethune Society, dedicated to the education of Bengalis, he established himself as a prominent commentator on Indian domestic life. He was respected by many Westernized Bengalis but his belief that India's social and political advancement hinged on the processes of Anglicization and female emancipation alienated the more radical members of Bengal's intelligentsia. Phear only moved comfortably among those Bengalis who acknowledged the superiority of Western achievements; it was beyond doubt to him that Bengal's indigenous culture, which he described in <span class="italic">The Aryan Village in India and Ceylon</span> (1880), represented a lesser, primitive stage of civilization.<br>
<br>Phear left Calcutta in August 1876 and in the following year was knighted and appointed chief justice of Ceylon, in which post he revised the civil and criminal code for the colony. He returned to England in 1879 and settled at Marpool Hall, Exmouth, Devon, and, as in Bengal, threw himself into local public life. He chaired the quarter sessions for fourteen years from October 1881 and served as an alderman of Devon county council from 1889 until his death. An ardent Liberal, he thrice contested unsuccessfully Devon county divisions in the Liberal interest: Honiton in 1885, Tavistock in 1886, and Tiverton in 1892. In 1886 he was president of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature, and Art. He was a good cricketer and a life member of the London Skating Club, and, from 1852, a fellow of the Geological Society.<br>
<br>Phear died at Marpool Hall, Exmouth, on 7 April 1905 and was buried at Littleham. His wife, Emily, a member of the Exmouth school board, had died in 1897.<br>
