<span class="headword">Perrot,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">Quaker schismatic</span>, was born in Ireland. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> suggested that he may have been a descendant of one of the illegitimate sons of Sir John Perrot (1528&#150;1592), lord deputy of Ireland; however, his name does not seem to appear in the nineteenth-century account of the family by Edward Barnwell. It was also claimed that he was a blacksmith from Sedbergh although this too has since been discounted.<br>
<br>Perrot was living 2 miles outside Waterford when, in 1655, he became a Quaker following a convincement by Edward Burrough; Perrot's wife and children were noted as still living there in 1659. Like many other early Quakers, Perrot had previously been a Baptist. In 1656 he was active as a Quaker missionary in Ireland, preaching in Limerick, where he was imprisoned twice in April, and in Kilkenny, where he was also incarcerated. He also suffered a spell in gaol in Dublin in May 1656, during which he wrote a work&#151;never published&#151;against the &#145;loathsome Abominacons&#146; of lawyers  (Carroll, 4). On his return to Kilkenny he intervened on behalf of a large group of imprisoned Irish Roman Catholics who were facing deportation, successfully gaining them their freedom. For his efforts in Ireland Perrot was described by Burrough&#151;himself expelled from the country early in 1656&#151;as &#145;Eminent in the nation&#146;  (Ingle, 198). Among the most prominent figures who knew Perrot at this time was the physician and friend of Samuel Hartlib, Benjamin Worsley, the surveyor-general of forfeited estates in Ireland; Perrot corresponded with Worsley and sought financial support for him for his later mission to the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>On 17 August 1656 Perrot experienced a vision at Cathrelagh:<blockquote>The word of the Lord came unto me &hellip; saying &hellip; behold I the Lord who have chosen thee from amongst men, doe Send thee into a farr country having given thee a sharpe Instrum[en]tt to thresh upon the Mountaines of Turkey. (Carroll, 9)</blockquote>At some point after this he left for England where on 25 December he signed one of the many petitions seeking the mitigation of the sentence of James Nayler, the Quaker who had notoriously re-enacted Jesus's entry into Jerusalem at Bristol in October. It is not known whether Perrot ever met Nayler, but as a letter of Perrot's written in early 1657 describes Nayler's &#145;agents&#146; as &#145;creeping upon their Bellyes&#146; and Martha Simmonds as &#145;their Miserable Mother&#146;, it is clear that he was not sympathetic to Nayler's views  (Carroll, 10). During his stay in England Perrot spent periods in London and the west country.<br>
<br>In May or June 1657, with the full support and financial backing of the Quaker movement, Perrot embarked on a mission, with five others, to the Ottoman empire to convert the sultan and to Rome to convert the pope. His companions were Beatrice Beckley, Mary Prince, Mary Fisher, John Luffe, and John Buckley. They reached Leghorn via Lyons on 6 August 1657, and after holding services there for two weeks and meeting with the local Jewish community&#151;using Latin as a common language&#151;they were examined by the Inquisition. While in Leghorn, Perrot wrote <span class="italic">Immanuel, the Salvation of Israel</span>, which was published in London the following year. Following an interview with the local governor on 17 August, the group sailed for the island of Zante, just off the Turkish coast, on 20 August. Shortly after their arrival there on 6 September, the party divided. One group, including Fisher and Beckley, headed for Crete, while Perrot and Buckley travelled overland, via Corinth and Athens, to the island of Negroponte (Evvoia) and to Smyrna, where the group was to reunite. In Athens Perrot wrote <span class="italic">To All the Baptists</span>, later published in 1660. The two men also preached in the city on 27 September and debated with two Greek priests. They were held for a time at Negroponte where, during that same month, Perrot wrote <span class="italic">An Epistle to the Greeks</span>, later published in 1661. The two arrived in Smyrna (now Izmir) very late in 1657, the rest of their group having been there since 18 November. The English consul, learning of their plans to meet with the sultan, advised them to turn back; shortly afterwards all but Mary Prince left Smyrna for Venice, but weather forced them to return to Zante. Here the group again divided: Fisher and Beckley travelled on to Adrianople (where they would meet the sultan) via the Peloponnese; Buckley headed for Constantinople; and Perrot and Luffe sailed to Venice, intending to reach Jerusalem.<br>
<br>After enduring treacherous weather (two passengers were killed during an electric storm) and the hostility of both crew and other passengers, Perrot and Luffe arrived in the Gulf of Venice on 25 February 1658. Disembarking on 22 March, the two men were quarantined in the leper colony of Lazzaretto for forty days. In total the men spent only about six or seven weeks in Venice, during which time they met with members of the Jewish community; Perrot also either had a meeting with the doge or sent him a document of some sort, which formed the occasion for <span class="italic">To the Prince of Venice</span> (1661), which Perrot wrote at this time. On 7 May they left for Rome, arriving at the city on 6 June and taking up lodgings in the Piazza Farnese. Perrot intended to meet with the pope, and so approached Thomas Courtney, a Jesuit and the English confessor in St Peter's Basilica; Perrot was referred to the pope's chaplain, John Crey, a fellow Irishman to whom Perrot explained his purpose &#145;as an unfolded sheet upon a smooth floor&#146;  (Carroll, 24). Two days later Perrot was arrested at his lodgings and interrogated by the city governor, who promised him &#145;a sudden, fair and public Tryal&#146;  (Carroll, 25). Luffe too seems to have been imprisoned at this time. After a week Perrot and Luffe were transferred to the Inquisition prison, where they were held for a further eighteen weeks. Upon further interrogation, Perrot was deemed mad and was taken to the &#145;Pazzarella&#146;, or &#145;Prison of Madmen&#146;; here both men were held in solitary confinement. By the end of 1658 Luffe was dead, officially from starvation through fasting although other evidence suggested that he may have been hanged&#151;by one account, upon the orders of the pope himself.<br>
<br>Perrot spent three years in the Pazzarella in squalid conditions. He was chained by the neck for the first few days, and then by the ankle for the next fourteen weeks. He reported being regularly tortured&#151;including being beaten with a pizzle, presumably in the belief that the insane could be beaten into sense. Support and sympathy came from Quakers in England, some of whom travelled to Rome to intercede on Perrot's behalf; George Fox himself expressed approval of Perrot's work in 1658. Eventual release came in late May or early June 1661, following the intervention of two other Quakers, Jane Stokes and Charles Bayly. The ill-fated mission prompted two Catholic accounts in the later 1660s&#151;one by the German Jesuit Theodore Rhay, the other by Cosimo de' Medici's secretary, Lorenzo Magalotti&#151;both of which record the story of Perrot and his companions with extensive refutation of their theology.<br>
<br>Perrot wrote numerous letters and works during his imprisonment, many of which were published after his release in 1661. The most notable were <span class="italic">Battering Rams Against Rome</span> (1661), a detailed account of his sufferings at the hands of the Roman Catholic authorities, dedicated &#145;To the tender, moderate, Roman-Catholick reader&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>), and <span class="italic">A Sea of the Seed's Sufferings, through which Runs a River of Rich Rejoycing</span> (1661), an extraordinary series of contemplations and songs in a variety of poetic forms, totalling some 1448 lines. The latter, a significant and unusual example of radical religious writing, indicated that Perrot was well read and familiar with poetic technique, and in its sublimation of his experiences of torture and abuse into a spiritual allegory built out of natural imagery (especially about the sea), the work bears some comparison with Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. However, it was an unpublished letter sent from Rome that caused the most immediate sensation within the Quaker movement; in it Perrot argued that&#151;contrary to Quaker practice&#151;men should not remove their hats during prayer.<br>
<br>After a journey through Italy and France that saw Bayly imprisoned in Bourg-d'Ault for confronting some local priests, Perrot returned to England by late July and arrived in London in mid-August. Fox met with him at once in a series of meetings aimed at tempering Perrot's increasingly divergent Quaker views. Perrot was accused of financial extravagance during his mission in the Mediterranean, and his writings, especially his poetry, were regarded as an offence to the principle of plainness; moreover, Fox and other prominent Quakers saw Perrot's stance on hats as vain and lacking in humility, but, as St Paul had indicated that women should cover their head when praying, they found it difficult to oppose Perrot's argument without undermining the traditional Quaker hostility to social forms or appearing fundamentally inequitable. Undaunted, Perrot spent the next few months preaching in London, Canterbury (where he was imprisoned in September), and East Anglia; at some point before the following summer he also made a brief trip to Ireland. However, despite some support from Isaac Penington, Edward Burrough, and John Crook among others, leading Friends were unrelenting in their disapproval of Perrot: his enthusiastic preaching, his growing popularity particularly with women Friends, and even his Rabbinic-like beard reminded them uncomfortably of Nayler. It was averred that he had taken on his ministerial role too soon, a point underlined when Perrot began to hold his own meetings in London which only helped to enhance his reputation as a schismatic. It is also possible that Fox in particular feared Perrot's continuing influence over Quaker Mediterranean missions, for which Perrot continued to find funds for the support of Friends, especially if they had been imprisoned, and acted as mediator between Quakers and Italian Roman Catholics. A meeting between Perrot and senior Quaker figures in London on new year's eve 1661 prompted a final breach. By the time that Perrot was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate in June 1662 for attending a Quaker meeting at the Bull and Mouth in London, he had been roundly condemned by the Quaker leadership.<br>
<br>In return for his release, Perrot agreed to become a voluntary exile in Barbados. He left England with the strong disapproval of Fox, especially after his advocacy of unity among nonconformists&#151;a view sustained by the clustering of several Perrot followers in Barbados. In the summer or autumn of 1663 Perrot visited Maryland and Virginia, where Quakers had been active since 1656, but was rejected by the Friends there who had possibly received warning letters from Fox. In Virginia Perrot advocated following no set or regular times for meetings but only as the spirit willed. In early 1664 he returned to Barbados and on 10 May the governor, Thomas Modyford, appointed him a captain. Thereafter, Perrot was famous for wearing a splendid satin coat and a sword though, more importantly, he received at the same time a 300 ton ship for transporting immigrants to Jamaica. In Barbados and Jamaica he then worked as a court clerk and, despite remaining a Friend, accepted payment for extracting the oaths that the Quakers refused to give. By this time Perrot had become firmly convinced of universalist principles (the belief that redemption is extended to all humankind), but the paper war with Fox continued unabated while others alleged that Perrot had renounced his faith for the sake of profit. Perrot continued to publish occasionally and became associated with Robert Rich, another Quaker separatist and sometime follower of Nayler who had emigrated to Barbados in the immediate aftermath of the Nayler affair. It may be that Perrot fell ill early in 1665 as he was certainly thinking of his death at that time; this finally occurred between 30 August, when he drew up his will, and 7 September 1665, when it was proved. In his will he mentioned a wife, Elizabeth, and two children. However, it was not until the following year, with the publication by eleven senior Quakers in May of the &#145;Testimony from the brethren&#146;, the recantation of several leading Perrot supporters at a London meeting hosted by Fox, and the establishment of regular monthly and quarterly meetings across the Quaker movement as a whole, that the Perrotian controversy was effectively quelled.<br>
<br>After Perrot's death Rich collected Perrot's letters to Fox and others, and these were published just after Rich's death as <span class="italic">Hidden Things Brought to Light</span> (1680).<br>
