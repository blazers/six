<span class="headword">&Oacute; hUiginn family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1600), <span class="occ">Gaelic poets</span>, were notable as a learned bardic family in Connaught for several centuries. The origin of the surname &Oacute; hUiginn is obscure, but it is a noteworthy fact that forenames of Norse origin (such as Iomhar, Maghnus) occur in several of the medieval generations in the genealogy of this family. Therefore, since no native forename Uige(a)nn (genitive Uiginn) has otherwise been attested, it is generally assumed that the surname has been based on a forename which was a borrowing of Norse <i>vikingr</i> &#145;viking&#146;. In the sixteenth century the surname &Oacute; hUiginn was to be found widely distributed in the midlands and west of the Shannon. The genealogy given in the seventeenth-century compilation now generally referred to as the <span class="italic">O Clery Book of Genealogies</span> was clearly for the Connaught branch of the family, apparently the only one which distinguished itself in the bardic profession. The principal patrons of this learned family over a period of almost 400 years were O'Conor-Sligo in Sligo (barony of Carbury), McWilliam Burke in Mayo, O'Hara in Sligo (barony of Leyny), O'Rourke in Leitrim, and O'Donnell in Donegal.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20646"></a><span class="headword">Tadhg  M&oacute;r &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1315)<span class="occ"></span> could have been the son of Giolla Coluim &Oacute; hUiginn. He was tutor to Maghnus (<i>d</i>. 1293), grandson of Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute; Conchobhair, king of Connaught. Only two of his poetic compositions seem to be extant, the first is his poem on the warlike upbringing of this prince, <span class="italic">Gach &eacute;an mar a adhbha</span> (&#145;Every bird has its nest&#146;), and follows the general pattern of this theme but introduces a pleasant variation by comparing Maghnus and his steed to famous warriors and steeds recorded in Irish history and literature, such as C&uacute; Chulainn and his Liath Macha, or Tadhg an Eich Gil (&#145;Tadhg of the White Steed&#146;) &Oacute; Conchobhair (<i>d</i>. 1030). Like all others of his profession he was clearly well versed in medieval Irish literature. In another remarkable poem, <i>sui generis</i> in Irish bardic verse, <span class="italic">Sl&aacute;n fat fholcadh / a Fhionnghuala r&eacute;idh roicheolchar</span> (&#145;In defiance of your bathing, O gentle music-loving Finola&#146;), Tadhg describes the beauty of Fionnghuala, daughter of the same Maghnus. He employs the conceit that her whole form is in evidence as she washes her hair. This description undoubtedly was inspired by a scene from the Irish otherworld, namely that found in the tale <span class="italic">Tochmarc &Eacute;ta&iacute;ne</span> (&#145;The wooing of &Eacute;ta&iacute;n&#146;), which describes the unearthly beauty of the fairy maiden <i>&Eacute;ta&iacute;n</i> (&Eacute;adaoin) as she is loosening her hair to wash it.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20647"></a><span class="headword">Tadhg  &Oacute;g &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1448)<span class="occ"></span> was a great-grandson of Tadhg M&oacute;r (<i>d</i>. 1315). His most renowned composition is an elegy on his elder brother and teacher, Fearghal Ruadh, <span class="italic">Anocht sgaoilid na scola</span> (&#145;To-night the schools disperse&#146;), written at the time of the seasonal closing of the schools in early summer. Fearghal Ruadh's death has been a disastrous loss to the profession of poetry:<blockquote>
<div>Gan mharthain do mhac &Aacute;ine,<br>
</div>
<div>rug don &eacute;igse a hamh&aacute;ille;<br>
</div>
<div>mar th&eacute;id cl&aacute;r a taoibh thunna,<br>
</div>
<div>do sgaoil f&aacute;l na foghluma.<br>
</div>(That &Aacute;ine's son lives not has robbed poetry of its gaiety; as a plank falls out of the side of a cask, the wall of learning has collapsed.)</blockquote>Here, by the bardic device called <i>d&uacute;nadh</i> (&#145;closure&#146;), the word <i>sgaoil</i> in the final line echoes part of the first line, thus associating the tragedy of the death of Fearghal Ruadh with the empty schools.<br>
<br>Tadhg &Oacute;g gained wide recognition throughout the Gaelic world in Ireland and Scotland, as is shown by the large number of his influential patrons. These included &Oacute; N&eacute;ill (in Tyrone), &Oacute; Domhnaill, &Oacute; Conchobhair Cairbreach (a family later called O'Conor-Sligo), &Oacute; Ceallaigh of U&iacute; Mhaine (O'Kelly of Hy-Many in co. Galway and co. Roscommon), &Oacute; Conchobhair Chiarraighe (co. Kerry), &Oacute; Cearbhaill of &Eacute;ile (O'Carroll in co. Offaly and Tipperary), M&aacute;g Uidhir (in Fermanagh), Mac Domhnaill of &Iacute;le (Islay in Scotland), and Mac Diarmada (McDermott of Moylurg in Roscommon). It is impossible, however, to outline the events of Tadhg &Oacute;g's full life from any internal evidence in his poems, for the business of the bardic poets was not to record their own achievements but rather those of their patrons. In <span class="italic">D&eacute;anaidh comhaonta, a chlann &Eacute;ibhir</span> (&#145;Be ye united, O children of &Eacute;ibhear&#146;) the poet, by a type of dramatic figure common in bardic poetry, urges &Oacute; Cearbhaill to seize the ancient royal seat of Cashel, unite all the men of Munster and their kinsmen, the Luighne of Lower Connaught, and drive the <i>Goill</i> (&#145;foreigners&#146; / English) out of Ireland.<br>
<br>On the other hand, like many others of his profession, Tadhg &Oacute;g availed himself of the patronage of the descendants of several of the Anglo-Norman conquerors of Ireland, such as the earl of Ormond (Butler), Mac Uilliam Uachtair (the de Burghs of Clanricarde in east Galway), and Mac Uilliam &Iacute;ochtair (in co. Mayo). Many other themes employed by the poet are commonplace in bardic verse and only a few of his poems are susceptible of exact dating. One of these is an elegy on Tadhg &Oacute; Ceallaigh of U&iacute; Mhaine who died in 1410, <span class="italic">Anois do tuigfidhe Tadhg</span> (&#145;Now might Tadhg be understood&#146;). Tadhg &Oacute;g's compositions were held in high esteem, and samples from his poems are frequently cited as illustrations in the grammatical and syntactical tracts employed in the schools. His many religious poems have largely been preserved in an anthology which has survived in the composite volume known as the <span class="roman">Yellow Book of Lecan</span>. This anthology has been published by Lambert McKenna under the title <span class="italic">D&aacute;n D&eacute;</span>.<br>
<br>Tadhg &Oacute;g, &#145;chief teacher of the poets of Ireland and Scotland&#146; (as he is described in the annals), died in 1448 at Cill Chonnla (Kilconla), Dunmore, co. Galway, and was buried in the monastery of &Aacute;th Leathan (Ballylahan), Templemore, Gallen, co. Mayo.<br>
<br>Maol Seachlainn na nUirsg&eacute;al (&#145;of the allegories&#146;) &Oacute; hUiginn (<i>fl</i>. 1400&times;50), was in the possession of lands at Mag Inghine an Sc&aacute;il (unidentified) in Cairbre (Carbury), co. Sligo, and had a turbulent relationship with his lord and patron, Brian (mac Domhnaill) &Oacute; Conchobhair, lord of Cairbre. He addressed several poems to &Oacute; Conchobhair and one to M&aacute;g Aonghusa (Magennis) of U&iacute;bh Eachach (Iveagh, co. Down).<br>
<br>Pilip Bocht &Oacute; hUiginn (<i>d</i>. 1487), a member of the Franciscan order (hence <i>bocht</i>, &#145;poor&#146;), was one of the chief exponents of Irish religious bardic poetry. His death is recorded in the annals of Ulster at 1487: &#145;Pilib bocht mac Cuinn Chrosaigh U&iacute; Uiginn dh&eacute;g in bhliadhainsi, idh&oacute;n, Br&aacute;thair Min&uacute;r de Observancia, nech is m&oacute;7 is ferr duanaire diadhachta san aimsir dheigheanaigh&#146; (&#145;Philip the Poor, son of Conn the Pock-marked Ua hUiginn, namely a friar minor of observance, one who was the most copious and the best devotional poet of later times&#146;).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20642"></a><span class="headword">Domhnall  mac Briain &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1502)<span class="occ"></span>, as recorded in the annals, died in 1502 on his return from pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Only one poem ascribed to him survives, <span class="italic">Misde nach &eacute;admhar &Eacute;ire</span> (&#145;So much the worse that Ireland is not jealous&#146;). It relates that &#145;Drong do Ghaoidhealaibh ghuirt Breagh &hellip; do fh&aacute;s &oacute; mhacaibh M&iacute;leadh&#146; (&#145;a band of the Gaels from the field of Bregia [Ireland] which is descended from the sons of M&iacute;l&#146;) settled and prospered in Scotland; hence Ireland's right to be jealous.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20648"></a><span class="headword">Tadhg  Dall &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (1550&#150;1591)<span class="occ"></span> is the best known of the bardic poets of the classical modern Irish period, mainly by virtue of the edition and translations of his poems by Eleanor Knott. He was the son of Mathghamhain &Oacute; hUiginn and his birthplace was probably in Luighne (barony of Leyny). According to a statement in a poem addressed by him to Aodh &Oacute; Domhnaill (Hugh O'Donnell), <span class="italic">Molfaid Conallaigh clann T&aacute;il</span> (&#145;The race of Conall will praise the descendants of T&aacute;l&#146;), he was fostered in T&iacute;r Conaill and it is presumed that he was educated at a bardic school there.<br>
<br>Among Tadhg Dall's more important poems are: an address to Conn &Oacute; Domhnaill, <span class="italic">T&oacute;gaibh eadrad is &Eacute;ire</span> (&#145;Raise the veil from Ireland&#146;), urging him to make Ireland his spouse; <span class="italic">Iomdha sochar ag s&iacute;ol N&eacute;ill</span> (&#145;Many privileges have the descendants of Niall&#146;), addressed to Toirdhealbhach Luineach &Oacute; N&eacute;ill (<i>an gh&eacute;ag abhla d'fhiodh Teamhrach</i>; &#145;the apple-branch of the wood of Tara&#146;); <span class="italic">Nodlaig do chuamar don Chraoibh</span> (&#145;At Christmas we went to the Creeve&#146;) to the same patron, celebrating a Christmas banquet given by &Oacute; N&eacute;ill to the poets of Ireland; three poems to C&uacute; Chonnacht M&aacute;g Uidhir (Maguire), <span class="italic">Daoine saora s&iacute;ol gColla</span> (&#145;Free people are the descendants of Colla&#146;), <span class="italic">Teallach f&eacute;ile Fir Mhanach</span> (&#145;Fermanagh is the hearthstone of hospitality&#146;), and <span class="italic">Mairg fh&eacute;agas ar Inis Ceithleann</span> (&#145;Alas for him who looks on Enniskillen&#146;); and <span class="italic">Pardhas F&oacute;dla Fir Mhanach</span> (&#145;Fermanagh is the paradise of Ireland&#146;) in praise of Brian M&aacute;g Uidhir.<br>
<br>Tadhg Dall met with a tragic end: members of a local branch of the U&iacute; Eadhra (the O'Haras) of Luighne, whom he had satirized, attacked him at his home in C&uacute;il re Coill (now the townland of Coolrecuill) and cut his tongue out. The record of the poet's death is cited by Knott as follows:<blockquote>In an Exchequer Inquisition taken at Ballymote, Co. Sligo, January 12, 1593, it was testified that Thadeus, alias Teage Dall O Higinn, late of Cowlrecoyll, in the aforesaid county, <i>generosus</i>, died at Cowlrecoyll on the last day of March, 1591, and that Thadeus oge mc Teage O Higgen, at the time of his father's death nine years of age, and unmarried, was his legitimate son and nearest heir. (Knott, 1.xv)</blockquote>This Thadeus, <a name="cosubject_75280"></a><span class="headword">Tadhg  &Oacute;g &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>b. </em>1581/2)<span class="occ"></span>, wrote an important tract on Irish grammar and prosody.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20644"></a><span class="headword">Maol Muire &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1591)<span class="occ"></span>, a brother of Tadhg Dall, was archbishop of Tuam and a trained poet. From Rome he addressed the poem <span class="italic">A fhir th&eacute;id go Fiadh bhFuinidh</span> (&#145;O man who goes to the western land&#146;) as an exile's greeting to Ireland through the person of a fellow countryman returning home. He died in Antwerp about 1591.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20645"></a><span class="headword">Mathghamhain &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1584)<span class="occ"></span>, Tadhg Dall's father, probably composed many poems, but only six are extant: three of these are included in the <span class="roman">Poem Book of the Dillons</span> (Royal Irish Academy, MS A.v.2) and one is found in the <span class="roman">Book of the O'Byrnes</span>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20643"></a><span class="headword">Domhnall  &Oacute;g mac Aodha &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1600)<span class="occ"></span> enjoyed the patronage of the lord of Luighne, Cian &Oacute; hEadhra (<i>d</i>. 1612), and of his son and successor, Tadhg Buidhe (<i>d</i>. 1616). His extant poems to these chieftains have been preserved in a vellum manuscript (the <span class="roman">Book of O'Hara</span>, National Library of Ireland, Dublin). He addressed a poem to Fiachaidh (mac Aodha) &Oacute; Broin (betrayed to the English in 1597), describing him as the prophesied one who is destined to rid Ireland of the foreigners.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20641"></a><span class="headword">Cormac  mac an Ghiolla Choluim &Oacute; hUiginn</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1590)<span class="occ"></span>, composed a long elegy on O'Conor-Sligo, Donnchadh (mac Cathail &Oacute;ig) &Oacute; Conchobhair.<br>
<br>Maol Muire (mac Eoghain) &Oacute; hUiginn's known work is believed to consist of three poems addressed to An Calbhach Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill about the middle of the seventeenth century, which have survived in a <span class="roman">Poem Book of the O'Donnells</span> compiled for Aodh &Oacute; Domhnaill (of co. Mayo) in the early eighteenth century; one poem in the <span class="roman">Poem Book of the Dillons</span> compiled for seventeenth-century members of the family of Viscount Dillon of Costello-Gallen, co. Mayo, whose seat was at Lough Glynn, co. Roscommon; a poem in praise of Oilill &Oacute; hEadhra of Luighne; and one in praise of Uilliam son of Uaithne &Oacute; Maoil Mhuaidh of Fir Cheall (co. Offaly), of a family well known for their patronage of Irish learning.<br>
<br>Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; hUiginn (<i>fl</i>. mid-17th cent.) was probably a native of co. Sligo. He addressed poems to members of the M&eacute;ig Uidhir of Fir Mhanach and to Oilill &Oacute; hEadhra. He probably was also the author of <span class="italic">F&eacute;ach f&eacute;in an obair-si, a Aodh</span> (&#145;See for thyself these doings, O Hugh&#146;), an allegorical poem cast in the form of an address by a woman to her husband, Aodh &Oacute; Ruairc, seeking his protection from a would-be suitor, Tom&aacute;s Mac Coisdealbha (Costello). This artistic poem is, however, as James Carney has explained, merely a sustained metaphor to be understood as an appeal to &Oacute; Ruairc by his &#145;spouse&#146; (the poet) against a rival patron.<br>
<br>Ruaidhr&iacute; (mac Cairbre) &Oacute; hUiginn of the branch seated at Tearmann Balla (Balla), Clanmorris, co. Mayo, compiled, in 1680, <span class="roman">Leabhar Cloinne Aodha Buidhe</span>, the <span class="roman">Poem Book of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill of Clann Aodha Buidhe</span> (Clandeboye, co. Antrim). He lived at Gort an Chairn (Gortagharn), Drummaul, co. Antrim.</div>
