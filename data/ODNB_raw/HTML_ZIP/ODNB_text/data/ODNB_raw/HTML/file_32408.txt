<span class="headword">Christie,  Richard Copley</span>  (1830&#150;1901), <span class="occ">educationist and scholar</span>, was born on 22 July 1830 at Lenton, Nottinghamshire, the second son of Lorenzo Christie (1802&#150;1892), a Manchester mill owner resident at Edale, Derbyshire, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of Isaac Bayley of Lenton Sands. Owing to weak health Christie was educated privately before entering Lincoln College, Oxford, in April 1849. There he shared with Mark Pattison common literary interests and ideas as to the higher purposes of university life. He obtained first-class honours in law and history, graduating BA in 1853 and MA in 1855.<br>
<br>In November 1853 Christie was appointed professor of ancient and modern history by the trustees of the newly founded Owens College, Manchester, and in the following year he was chosen for the Faulkner chair of political economy and commercial science. To these he added a third chair, jurisprudence and law, in 1855. A keen teacher of evening classes, which were then one of the most important departments of Owens College, he was on the committee of Manchester Working Men's College (1858). On 13 June 1861 he married Mary Helen (<i>d</i>. 1911), daughter of Samuel Fletcher, of Broomfield near Manchester, a merchant and one of the original trustees of Owens College.<br>
<br>Christie had originally intended to pursue a legal career. Admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn (21 November 1854), he was called to the bar in June 1857 and immediately commenced practice at Manchester as an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and in the chancery court of the county palatine of Lancaster. His practice continuously grew until, at the time of his retirement through ill health in 1877, he was the leader of the Manchester equity bar. From January 1872 until January 1894 Christie was chancellor of the diocese of Manchester, having been appointed by James Fraser, bishop of Manchester. This position involved him in the proceedings against S. F. Green, rector of Miles Platting, who was imprisoned in 1881 for ritualist practices.<br>
<br>Although the growth of his legal practice caused him to resign his chairs of history and political economy in 1866, and jurisprudence in 1869, Christie played an increasingly important part in the history of Owens College. With Thomas Ashton, J. G. Greenwood, and H. E. Roscoe, he was a supporter of the movement to reconstitute the college, and he was named as one of the governors under the resulting <span class="roman">Owens College Extension Act</span> of 1870. He was a member of the executive body, the college council, from 1870 until 1886. In these capacities he took a leading part in the growth of college, including the incorporation with the college of the Royal Manchester School of Medicine, and the efforts which in 1880 resulted in the grant of a charter to the Victoria University. Christie was a member of the university court until 1897, and received an honorary LLD from the university in 1895.<br>
<br>Christie was placed in a position of altogether exceptional responsibility towards the city of Manchester following the death in 1887 of his friend Sir Joseph Whitworth. He became chairman of the Whitworth company, a position he held until its purchase by Armstrong, Mitchell &amp; Co. in 1897. By Whitworth's will, Christie was appointed one of the three legatees to whom was bequeathed a residuary estate of more than &pound;0.5 million in equal shares for their own use, &#145;they being each of them aware of the objects&#146; to which these funds would have been applied by the testator, had he been able to carry out the plans that had occupied him so long. Of existing institutions, Owens College was judged by the legatees to have a primary claim upon their munificence; and sums amounting (apart from that expended on the purchase of an estate to be held by the college for hospital purposes) to more than one fifth of the total at their disposal were devoted by them to the various departments of the college. These donations were made by the legatees in common; in 1897, however, Christie personally assigned a sum exceeding &pound;50,000 out of the final share of the residue falling to him for the erection of a Whitworth Hall, to complete the front quadrangle of Owens College. He was president of the Whitworth Institute from 1890 to 1895 and was much interested in the medical and other charities of Manchester, especially the Cancer Pavilion and Home, of whose committee he was chairman from 1890 to 1893. In October 1893 the freedom of the city of Manchester was conferred upon him and his surviving fellow legatee, R. D. Darbishire.<br>
<br>Over many years Christie pursued literary and bibliographical researches in France and elsewhere during his vacations. The resulting publication in 1880 of <span class="italic">Etienne Dolet, the Martyr of the Renaissance</span>, established his literary reputation. It was translated into French by Professor C. Stryienski (1886), and went through a second English edition in 1899. Further essays on personalities of special interest to him in the history of the Renaissance appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> (1885), and the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> (1895). From 1883 to his death Christie was chairman of the Chetham Society, to whose publications he contributed <span class="italic">The Old Church and School Libraries of Lancashire</span> (1885) and portions of the <span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence of Dr John Worthington</span> (1886). For the Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, of which he was president from 1883 to 1895, he produced an edition of <span class="italic">Annales Cestrienses</span> (1887).<br>
<br>Christie took a very active interest in the Library Association of the United Kingdom; he was a vice-president of the Bibliographical Society for many years, a member of the London Library Committee, and chairman of the library committee of Royal Holloway College, where he was a governor (1892&#150;7). His gift to Owens College of a library building, the Christie Library, designed by Alfred Waterhouse and erected at a cost of over &pound;21,000, was opened in 1898. He bequeathed to it his own library of 75,000 volumes, which he had accumulated principally to assist his Renaissance studies. Most notable of its contents was the collection, unequalled as to completeness, of the issues of Dolet's press; it also contained a large number of Aldines, a series of editions of Horace, and about 600 volumes published by Sebastian Gryphius of Lyons.<br>
<br>Christie died at Ribsden, Windlesham, Surrey on 9 January 1901 having been virtually confined to his couch during the last two years of his life. His remains, after cremation at Woking, were buried in the churchyard at Valley End, near Sunningdale.<br>
