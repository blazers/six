<span class="headword">Pritchard <span class="st"> [Prichard]</span>, Sir  William</span>  (1631/2&#150;1705), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was probably born in Horsleydown, Surrey, the second son of Francis Prichard, rope maker, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Eggleston. Apprenticed to a Southwark merchant tailor in 1647, Pritchard became free of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1655. By the time of the Restoration he had succeeded to his father's trade, which he continued at Eltham, Kent; and after 1663 he was the supplier of rope and match to the Ordnance office. The diarist Samuel Pepys encountered him in 1662 and again in 1668, mistaking him on the first occasion for a theatre musician and demanding a song from him. About 1669 Pritchard married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1718), daughter of Francis Cook of Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>By the late 1670s Pritchard had made a fortune supplying cordage and match to the navy during the second and third Dutch wars. In 1671 he sold the manor house of Tower Place in Woolwich to the king, receiving royal wharves and storehouses in exchange, properties that he subsequently leased back to the crown. After relocating his business to Heydon Yard in the Minories, near the Tower of London, he quickly became prominent in the corporation of London. Knighted and chosen alderman of Broad Street in 1672, he was also elected sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1672&#150;3 and master of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1673&#150;4. He served as a London assessment commissioner in 1673&#150;80 and 1689&#150;90, as a London militia colonel in 1676&#150;87, 1690&#150;94, and 1702&#150;5, as a London lieutenancy commissioner in 1677&#150;87, 1688&#150;94, and 1702&#150;5, and as president of the Honourable Artillery Company in 1681&#150;90 and 1703&#150;5. In 1678 he purchased the manor of Great Linford, Buckinghamshire, from Richard Napier for &pound;19,500. He also established an additional London residence in Highgate.<br>
<br>In September 1679, in the midst of the Popish Plot furore, Pritchard was reportedly among the aldermen who refused to kiss the hand of James, duke of York. But as the contest over the royal succession spawned whig and tory parties in London, his Anglican loyalist convictions and his business interests aligned him with the court. Pritchard was a steward for a feast for loyalist apprentices in August 1682; and as the senior alderman beneath the chair, he was the loyalist candidate for lord mayor for 1682&#150;3. The mayoral election of 1682 was overshadowed by the protracted contest for the shrievalty that preceded it; but Pritchard's election was just as much a part of Charles II's campaign to recover London from the whigs, and his mayoralty was memorable. The court-sponsored tory sheriffs for 1682&#150;3, who were sworn just before the mayoral election of 29 September and who were the presiding officers in common hall, declared that a majority of the electors preferred Pritchard. But this result was contested on behalf of two whig candidates by Thomas Papillon and John Dubois, whose claim to the shrievalty was recognized by the London whigs and who had also attempted to preside. When both whigs topped Pritchard in the ensuing poll, the loyalist-dominated court of aldermen adjusted a scrutiny in favour of Pritchard. But the aldermen's declaration of Pritchard as lord mayor was rejected by the whigs, who boycotted the mayoral show and sued for the offices of sheriff and lord mayor in the court of king's bench. In Pritchard's first days as lord mayor, whig crowds commemorating the Gunpowder Plot mobbed him when he sought to disperse them with the trained bands, and broke his windows.<br>
<br>Pritchard laboured throughout his mayoralty to reduce whig influence in the corporation and to enforce the <span class="roman">Conventicle Acts</span>. When he and the tory aldermen ignored a mandamus the whigs had secured from king's bench to show why they should not invest Papillon and Dubois with the shrievalty, the lord mayor was threatened with impeachment by William Williams, former speaker and chief whig legal adviser. When king's bench accepted the aldermen's eventual reply to the mandamus, the whigs brought individual suits against Pritchard and his predecessor for accepting false sheriffs. Legal and extra-legal whig strategies converged in April 1683, when Pritchard and several aldermen were arrested by the city coroner for their failure to respond to writs on behalf of Papillon and Dubois that were taken out by Richard Goodenough, one of their counsel. Goodenough and some of the coroner's associates were already involved in a plot to assassinate the king, and they also planned to murder the lord mayor in their intended insurrection.<br>
<br>What exactly was intended in Pritchard's arrest is unclear; but after the subsequent disclosures about whig plotting, the government claimed that it was intended to provide cover for an uprising. While the privy council panicked, Pritchard outmanoeuvred his captors, eventually suing Papillon and Dubois for false arrest, and winning &pound;10,000 in damages from Papillon. Pritchard's mayoralty nevertheless ended in personal embarrassment. When the crown, which had won its <i>quo warranto</i> suit against the corporation charter, gave the corporation the opportunity to surrender its charter voluntarily, the whigs managed to carry a common council vote against the surrender, and Pritchard was said not to have &#145;answered expectations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 3.125). The charter was declared forfeit, but Pritchard continued as lord mayor, by royal commission, until the end of the customary term. He transferred as alderman to Bridge at this time and became a JP for Kent (1683&#150;8).<br>
<br>Pritchard was among the Anglican loyalists chosen in 1685 to represent London in James II's parliament, but he became uneasy in 1687 as James reconstructed his regime on the basis of toleration. When James sought to mend fences with his former enemies, Pritchard agreed to legal relief for Papillon, who had fled the country; but the king discharged him from all his London offices when he refused to support an address on behalf of liberty for conscience. In October 1688, when James restored the London charter upon news of an impending invasion from the Netherlands, Pritchard turned &#145;Knave&#146;, in royal eyes, by declining to reaccept office as lord mayor without a writ of error in the <i>quo warranto</i> case  (DWL, Morrice, Ent'ring book, Q. 303). After some hesitation, he did resume his aldermanic position, returning to Broad Street; and he was among the city representatives who presented an address to the arriving prince of Orange in December. He was also chosen president of St Bartholomew's Hospital at this time, serving for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>As the whigs gained the initiative in civic affairs during the revolution of 1688, Pritchard became politically vulnerable as one of those who had co-operated in the crown's take-over and suppression of the corporation in 1682&#150;3. He had &#145;but a very few hands&#146; when put up in common hall for city MP for the convention in January 1689; and his political behaviour, as well as that of the other leading civic tories, was investigated in the House of Lords in May 1690  (DWL, Morrice, Ent'ring book, Q. 419). By that time, however, William III had broken with the whig leadership in parliament and signalled his new favour for the church party in an alteration of the London lieutenancy, which promptly reappointed Pritchard and other tories as militia colonels. Pritchard and three tory colleagues were also chosen city MPs for a new parliament in March 1690. They promoted passage of a Commons bill to require fresh civic elections as part of a statutory reversal of the <i>quo warranto</i>. When the court of aldermen, now dominated by the whigs, responded by continuing the sitting whig lord mayor, despite a slight common hall majority for a tory opponent, Pritchard borrowed a legal leaf from the whigs. He took out a king's bench mandamus for the office himself, claiming that he should return to the position he held when the charter was forfeited.<br>
<br>Although this device failed, Pritchard remained involved in party wrangling for the remainder of William's reign. He was defeated as a church tory candidate for city MP in 1695 and January 1701; but he returned to his seat in July 1702, after the succession of Queen Anne. Although a marginal figure in parliamentary affairs, Pritchard became a leading investor in the Royal African Company and (after initial association with its critics) in the &#145;old&#146; East India Company, in which he eventually owned &pound;15,000 in shares. He served on the governing court of committees of the East India Company in 1696&#150;7 and 1698&#150;1703 and as a Royal African Company assistant in 1699&#150;1700 and 1704&#150;5. In 1698&#150;1701 he acted as a delegate of the East India Company in negotiations with the &#145;new&#146; company that had been launched in 1698. Pritchard also served as a commissioner for the construction of Greenwich Hospital and for the national land bank scheme of 1696. In 1701 he was a founding member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.<br>
<br>Pritchard died on 20 February 1705 at his Heydon Yard residence, aged seventy-three. He was buried in the church at Great Linford, Buckinghamshire, after a procession from Highgate. Lewis Atterbury, Highgate parson and brother of the high-flying Francis Atterbury, preached his funeral sermon. Because his only son had died twenty years earlier, Pritchard left most of his estate to two kinsmen, after first providing a &pound;1200 annuity for his wife, who died in 1718. He also endowed almshouses at Great Linford and provided for a charity school there.<br>
