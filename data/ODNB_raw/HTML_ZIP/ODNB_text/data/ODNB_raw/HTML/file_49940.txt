<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson,  Cecil Antonio <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1928&#150;1991), <span class="occ">theatre and film director</span>, was born on 5 June 1928 at 28 Bingley Road, Saltaire, Shipley, Yorkshire, the only son of Clarence Albert Richardson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1967), pharmacist, and his wife, Elsie Evans, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ingle (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1975), the daughter of a bankrupted West Hartlepool shipbuilder. After attending Ashville College, Harrogate (1939&#150;45), he went up to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1948, where his audacious production of <span class="italic">Dr Faustus</span> prompted his election as president of both the Experimental Theatre Club and the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Richardson graduated with a third in English in 1951 and he joined the BBC, where he made his professional directing d&eacute;but with Giraudoux's <span class="italic">The Apollo of Bellac</span> in 1953. However, he was fired from his West End bow, <span class="italic">Mr Kettle and Mrs Moon</span> (1954), although, thanks to J. B. Priestley, he retained his credit. It was about this time that he befriended the actor George Devine, with whom he had worked on a BBC adaptation of Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Actor's End</span> (1955). Later that year they co-formed the English Stage Company, which began its tenure at the Royal Court Theatre with the premi&egrave;re of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55236/', "John Osborne's")</script> prototype &#145;angry young man&#146; drama, <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1956). Although several early reviews were hostile, it was hailed as a watershed in British theatre after <span class="italic">The Observer</span> critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, &#145;I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>&#146;  (Richardson, 79). The English stage was seemingly in his thrall. Yet the angular, garrulous Richardson was something of a young man in a hurry and he had already moved into films. In 1955 he co-directed, with Karel Reisz, <span class="italic">Momma Don't Allow</span>, a short documentary study of a north London jazz club that was screened at the National Film Theatre in February 1956 as part of the influential Free Cinema programme. Indeed, the movement's motto, &#145;Perfection is not an aim&#146;  (ibid., 69), would long remain Richardson's rallying cry.<br>
<br>Shortly after directing Laurence Olivier in the Royal Court production of Osborne's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (1957), Richardson and Osborne co-founded Woodfall Films. Having brought <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (1960) to the screen, he continued to embrace the social realist, or &#145;kitchen sink&#146;, tradition with his versions of Shelagh Delaney's <span class="italic">A Taste of Honey</span> (1961) and Alan Sillitoe's <span class="italic">The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</span> (1962). However, it was his first colour feature, <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1963), that earned him international recognition and a reputation for literate film-making. However, he would never repeat the success of this reworking of Henry Fielding's picaresque novel, which became only the second British feature to win the Oscar for best picture; it also brought Richardson the Oscar for best direction. Following Osborne's <span class="italic">Luther</span> (1961), Richardson grew increasingly disillusioned with what he described as &#145;totem theatre&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 16 Nov 1991). Nevertheless he drew praise for his staging of <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> (1964), <span class="italic">The Threepenny Opera</span> (1972), and <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (1973), all three of which starred Vanessa Redgrave (<i>b</i>. 1937). Richardson had married Redgrave, the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31591/', "Sir Michael Redgrave")</script> and Rachel Kempson, on 28 April 1962; they had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102176/', "Natasha Jane Richardson (1963&#150;2009)")</script> and Joely (<i>b</i>. 1965), who would both become actors. The couple divorced in 1967, following Richardson's affair with Jeanne Moreau&#151;whom he had directed in Jean Genet's <span class="italic">Mademoiselle</span> (1966) and in Marguerite Duras's <span class="italic">The Sailor from Gibraltar</span> (1967)&#151;and Redgrave's liaison with the Italian star Franco Nero.<br>
<br>Now based at Le Nid du Duc in the south of France, Richardson embarked on a sequence of literary adaptations&#151;Evelyn Waugh's <span class="italic">The Loved One</span> (1965), Vladimir Nabokov's <span class="italic">Laughter in the Dark</span> (1969), Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1969), Edward Albee's <span class="italic">A Delicate Balance</span> (1973), and even a version of Dick Francis's horse-racing whodunit <span class="italic">Dead Cert</span> (1974). Only his extravagant slice of costume realism, <span class="italic">The Charge of the Light Brigade</span> (1968), found widespread critical favour, although both his biopic of the Australian outlaw <span class="italic">Ned Kelly</span> (1970), with Mick Jagger in the title role, and a return to Fielding, with <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (1977), had their adherents. Nevertheless, Richardson never broke the cinematic mould in the same way he had done with the stage. He was removed by producer Berry Gordy jun. from <span class="italic">Mahogany</span> (1975), for failing to &#145;capture the black point of view&#146;  (Lyon, 446), and he had to endure his collaboration with Jack Nicholson, <span class="italic">The Border</span> (1982), being saddled with an upbeat ending. Largely ostracized from Hollywood after his faithful adaptation of John Irving's <span class="italic">The Hotel New Hampshire</span> (1984), he had to content himself with a succession of teleplays and miniseries.<br>
<br>From the early 1970s Richardson was resident in Los Angeles, California, with Grizelda Grimond, the only daughter of the former Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond. They had one daughter, Katherine (<i>b</i>. 1973). Having been diagnosed as HIV positive, he completed a memoir, <span class="italic">Long Distance Runner</span> (1993), and his final feature, <span class="italic">Blue Sky</span>, which was released three years after his death in Los Angeles from a neurological condition brought on by AIDS on 14 November 1991.<br>
