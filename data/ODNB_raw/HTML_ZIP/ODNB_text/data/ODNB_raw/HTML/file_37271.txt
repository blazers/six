<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cayley, Sir  George</span>, sixth baronet  (1773&#150;1857), <span class="occ">aeronautical designer</span>, was born on 27 December 1773 in Scarborough, Yorkshire, the only son of Sir Thomas Cayley (1732&#150;1792), and his wife, Isabella Seton (<i>d</i>. 1828); there were also four daughters. After brief schooling in York he was educated privately by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28481/', "George Walker FRS")</script> in Nottingham and George Cadogan Morgan in Southgate, Middlesex, two nonconformist ministers selected by his mother. He succeeded his father as baronet in 1792, and lived at Brompton Hall, between Pickering and Scarborough, throughout his life. On 9 July 1795 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1854), the daughter of his first tutor, the Revd George Walker; they had three sons and seven daughters, of whom three children died young.<br>
<br>As a landowner, Cayley was actively interested in agricultural improvements, and in 1800 he took a leading part in obtaining an act of parliament for the Muston drainage scheme, covering 10,000 acres frequently flooded by the rivers Derwent and Hertford. He was chairman of the directors of the scheme, which was executed by the engineer William Chapman, who developed a novel system using drainage ditches parallel to the main river channels.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Cayley showed keen interest in science and engineering developments, particularly in aeronautics. As early as 1799 he formulated the concept of the classical fixed wing aeroplane with separate mechanisms for generating lift and propulsion, and soon afterwards began experiments with a whirling arm rig to measure the lift of wings. In 1809 he experimented with a glider capable of lifting a person, and he published a paper in <span class="italic">Nicholson's Journal</span> (November 1809&#150;March 1810) setting out clearly the basic principles of aeroplane flight. This paper was thought sufficiently perceptive and important to be reprinted in England in 1876, in France in 1877, and in the USA in 1895.<br>
<br>Cayley also experimented with lighter-than-air flight: he wrote three papers on airships in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> (February 1816&#150;July 1817) of Alexander Tilloch, and in 1820 he successfully flew a model airship at Brompton. In a period when ballooning was an activity only for itinerant showmen, any interest in flying invited ridicule, but he made several unsuccessful attempts to form a society to encourage aeronautical developments. He continued to speculate on the subject, and wrote letters to various journals, but seems to have done little further practical work until 1849, when a glider large enough to carry a small child was launched in free flight at Brompton. This was followed by a full-sized machine, reputedly piloted by his coachman, in 1853. Although the evidence for these flights is little better than anecdotal, sufficient information is available in his published and private papers to make possible the construction of a reproduction of the latter machine, which was successfully flown for a television film in 1972.<br>
<br>The aeronautical pioneers in the nineteenth century were constrained by the lack of a lightweight power source. Cayley was convinced that the steam engine would never be suitable, and he experimented from 1799 with hot air engines, and from 1807 with engines fuelled by gunpowder. Nothing came of the latter, but about 1838 he demonstrated a fairly successful hot air engine in London, suitable for a road vehicle.<br>
<br>Letters published in <span class="italic">Mechanics' Magazine</span> from 1826 to 1856 attest to Cayley's interest in many technical topics, including a projected caterpillar tractor, the safety of railway travel, projectile design, and an artificial hand made for one of his tenants. Convinced that the general public had an unsatisfied thirst for knowledge, he took an active part in several educational activities. He was president of the York Mechanics' Institute from its foundation in 1827, and was a founder member of the Yorkshire and Scarborough philosophical societies, and of the British Association, which first met in York in 1831.<br>
<br>In London, Cayley supported the formation of the Adelaide Gallery at the Strand, where lectures and demonstrations and an exhibition of machines and models were intended to educate and amuse the public. When it appeared that the intent to educate had been overwhelmed by the need to amuse, Cayley became chairman of the Royal Polytechnic at Regent Street, which from 1838 sought to do what the Adelaide Gallery had failed to do.<br>
<br>From early youth Cayley was a keen proponent of parliamentary reform, and he took an active part in local whig politics. He became president of the York Whig Club from 1821 to 1827, and was MP for Scarborough from 1832 to 1834. Among a wide circle of friends and correspondents Cayley seems to have been recognized as a generous and modest man of great personal charm. He died at Brompton Hall on 15 December 1857, and was buried at Brompton church. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his only surviving son, Digby (1807&#150;1883).<br>
