<span class="headword">Priestley,  Timothy</span>  (1734&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 19 June 1734 at Owler Lane, Birstall Fieldhead, West Riding of Yorkshire, the second of the six children of Jonas Priestley (1700&#150;1779), cloth-dresser, and his first wife, Mary Swift (1706&#150;1739), daughter of Joseph Swift, maltster and farmer of Shafton, near Wakefield. He was brought up by his maternal grandfather after his mother's death in childbed in December 1739 and was sent to school at Batley, Yorkshire. For some time he followed his father's trade. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22788/', "Joseph Priestley")</script>, the scientist and theologian, who thought him frivolous, related how he snatched from his brother &#145;a book of knight-errantry&#146; and flung it away. Timothy recalled kneeling down with Joseph &#145;while he prayed&#146; at the age of six and his brother's growing interest and delight in scientific experiments  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Joseph Priestley</span>, 140). Whenever his brother made a new discovery Timothy was &#145;soon acquainted with it&#146;, and he remembered that when Joseph &#145;was making much progress in electricity&#146; he showed him &#145;how to melt steel&#146;  (ibid., 12). None the less, Timothy was far more practical than his brother and later used his self-taught skills in brass- and wood-working to make &#145;electrifying machines&#146; to his brother's designs  (ibid., 20). Their strong Calvinistic family background encouraged both brothers to train for the dissenting ministry, and Timothy became only the second student to enrol at the academy established in 1756 by James Scott (1710&#150;1783), the recently appointed minister of Upper Chapel, Heckmondwike, Yorkshire. Joseph Priestley regarded the course of studies as &#145;an imperfect education&#146;, but it strengthened Timothy's Calvinist theology. Joseph subsequently embraced unitarian doctrines, which placed an increasing strain on the relationship between the two brothers. Timothy distinguished himself as an assiduous pupil; he got into trouble, however, by going out to preach without leave. His preaching was popular, and he was employed in mission work at Ilkeston, Derbyshire, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1760 Priestley was ordained pastor of the congregation at Kipping, Thornton, near Bradford. It was a difficult pastorate, for the owner of the Kipping estate had ceased to be in sympathy with nonconformity. He also faced difficulties when he became minister of Hunter's Croft Congregational Church, Manchester, in 1766. Although the chapel was enlarged during his ministry, he had frequent quarrels with his deacons. Described by Dr Alexander Mackennal as &#145;a strong preacher, careless of personal dignity, and of abounding audacity both in his pulpit utterances and in private speech&#146;, many stories were told of his eccentricities: his deacons criticized him for irreverently ascending the pulpit with his hat on his head and for making packing cases for the liquor trade on Sunday nights  (Nightingale, 5.117). He retorted that he never began work until the clock struck twelve and that his ministerial stipend of &pound;60 was inadequate to support his wife and family. Priestley had married some time before 1768 when his son William was born, and referred to his &#145;small family &hellip; having a child added to my number every year&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Joseph Priestley</span>, 20). His wife may have been Margaret Brodie, whose marriage to a Timothy Priestley on 26 April 1764 is recorded in the parish register of Manchester parish church.<br>
<br>Priestley's unsolicited and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to persuade the congregation at Hale Chapel, near Altrincham, Cheshire, to resist the appointment of an Arian or Socinian minister when a vacancy arose at the chapel after 1767 confirm his uncompromising adherence to Calvinist orthodoxy. A letter written to William Whitelegg at Hale Barns Green (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1769) reveals his concern for &#145;the decay of the Dissenting cause in general&#146; as a result of the advance of theological liberalism  (Kenworthy, 131). Priestley refused to join the petitions of 1772&#150;3 for relaxation of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> unless concealment of heresy should be made a capital offence. His relationship with his brother deteriorated further after 1774 when Timothy received an invitation to preach at George Whitefield's Tabernacle, Moorfields; Joseph told him that it mortified him to hear people say &#145;Here is a brother of yours preaching at the Tabernacle.&#146; In August 1782 the two Priestleys were appointed to preach the &#145;double lecture&#146; at Oldbury, Worcestershire; Joseph wished his brother to decline, and, on Timothy's refusal to give way, withdrew himself, his place being taken by Habakkuk Crabb.<br>
<br>Priestley's Manchester ministry terminated in his formal dismissal on 14 April 1784, only two hands being held up in his favour. He moved to Dublin, where he remained for some two years. He then received a call to succeed Richard Woodgate, who had died in 1787, as minister of the Jewin Street Independent Church, London. He issued a periodical, the <span class="italic">Christian's Magazine, or, Gospel Repository</span>, designed to counteract unitarianism, under the patronage of Selina, countess of Huntingdon, to whom he dedicated the first volume in 1790 and whose friendship he enjoyed. It contains a biography of his tutor, Scott, which was reprinted separately in 1791. On his brother's death he preached at Jewin Street on 29 April 1803 and printed a funeral sermon, with an appendix of &#145;authentic anecdotes&#146;, the authenticity of some of which has been disputed. He was more imaginative than his brother and probably shared his defects of memory. His advertised <span class="italic">Animadversions</span> on his brother's theological views does not seem to have been printed. He did, however, publish <span class="italic">The Christian's Looking Glass</span> (1790&#150;92), <span class="italic">Family Exercises</span> (1792), an annotated <span class="italic">Family Bible</span> (1793), and a few single sermons. He died at Islington on 23 April 1814 &#145;in great peace and tranquillity&#146;, and was buried at Bunhill Fields on 29 April  (Nightingale, 5.117). The Revd Joseph Cockin of Halifax delivered the funeral address and the Revd George Burder preached a funeral sermon at Jewin Street &#145;to a very crowded congregation&#146;. The inscription on his tomb recorded that &#145;for more than half a century he preached with fidelity and success the unsearchable riches of Christ&#146;  (ibid., 5.119). His son William (1768&#150;1827) was Independent minister at Fordingbridge, Hampshire.<br>
