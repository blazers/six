<span class="headword">Tomkins,  Peltro William</span>  (1759&#150;1840), <span class="occ">engraver and draughtsman</span>, was born on 10 October 1759 in St Pancras, Middlesex, and baptized there on 15 October 1759, a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45872/', "William Tomkins (c.1732&#150;1792)")</script>, landscape painter, and his wife, Susanna Callard. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1775, aged fifteen, and was taught to engrave by Francis Bartolozzi, a connection proudly proclaimed by Tomkins on many plates. After 1781, working chiefly in stipple, he engraved a large number of plates for a variety of publishers. The designers he interpreted were principally contemporaries such as William Redmore Bigg, Henry Bunbury, William Hamilton, Angelica Kaufmann, and Thomas Stothard. He was one of the principal engravers employed by Thomas Macklin for his <span class="italic">British Poets</span> and produced a fine interpretation of Henry Fuseli's <span class="italic">Prince Arthur's Vision</span> (1788) for the first number. He married Lucy Jones on 2 June 1787 and raised a large family, including a daughter, Emma, who practised as an artist and married Samuel Smith, an engraver.<br>
<br>Tomkins gave drawing lessons to the daughters of George III, and in 1793 he was appointed historical engraver to Queen Charlotte. He engraved Princess Elizabeth's designs for illustrations to Sir J. Bland Burgess's poem &#145;The Birth and Triumph of Love&#146;. In 1793 he joined his brother J. F. Tomkins, trading as P. W. Tomkins &amp; Co. at his print shop, 49 New Bond Street, a business continued until 1823. They financed ambitious works, notably an illustrated edition of James Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span> (1797), with engravings by Tomkins and Bartolozzi after designs by William Hamilton. This was arguably the most magnificent book to be illustrated with stipple engravings. Two much later ventures, <span class="italic">The British Gallery of Pictures</span> (1818&#150;20), with text by Henry Tresham, and <span class="italic">Engravings of the &hellip; Marquis of Stafford's Collection of Pictures</span> (1818), with text by William Young Ottley, were less successful. Tomkins suffered a heavy financial loss and was compelled to obtain a private act of parliament (57 Geo. III c. lxi) authorizing him to dispose by lottery of the watercolour drawings from which he had worked, together with the unsold impressions of the plates (many already coloured), the whole being valued at &pound;150,000. The first prize consisted of 291 pictures, representing the entire collection of the marquess of Stafford. Before the lottery could take place the letterpress and apparatus for captioning the prints was lost in a fire and Tomkins was obliged to seek a second act (1 Geo. IV c. lxxxix) to extend the date of drawing the tickets until 31 March 1821. His last work was a series of three plates (1834&#150;40) from copies by Harriet Whitshed of paintings discovered at Hampton Court. Tomkins died on 22 April 1840 at his home, 25 Osnaburgh Street, St Pancras, and was buried on 28 April at St Pancras Church.<br>

<a name="cosubject_27508"></a><span class="headword">Charles Tomkins</span>  (1757&#150;1823), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, was born in London on 7 July 1757, the elder brother of Peltro William Tomkins. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1773 to 1779. In 1776 he gained a premium from the Society of Arts for a view of Millbank, and he subsequently practised as a topographical and antiquarian draughtsman and aquatint engraver and publisher. A drawing of London from Wandsworth Hill was engraved and published in 1786. In 1791 he published, from 2 Rathbone Place, <span class="italic">Eight Views of Reading Abbey</span>, with text by himself; this was reissued in 1805 with twenty-three additional views of churches originally connected with the abbey. In 1796 he published <span class="italic">A Tour to the Isle of Wight</span>, with eighty aquatint plates, and in 1805 a set of illustrations to Petrarch's sonnets, which he dedicated to the duchess of Devonshire. With Francis Jukes he engraved Cleveley's two pictures of the advance and defeat of a floating battery at Gibraltar (1782); he also drew and engraved the plates to the <span class="italic">British Volunteer</span> (1799) and a plan view of the sham fight of the St George's volunteers in Hyde Park in the same year. Many of his watercolour drawings are in the Crowle copy of Pennant's <span class="italic">London</span>, in the British Museum print room. He had married, on 11 July 1782 at St Marylebone Church, London, Ann Hague of Hammersmith. He died in 1823.<br>
