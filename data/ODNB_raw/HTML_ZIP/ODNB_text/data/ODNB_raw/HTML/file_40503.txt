<span class="headword">Knox, Sir  (Thomas) Malcolm</span>  (1900&#150;1980), <span class="occ">academic administrator and philosopher</span>, was born on 28 November 1900 at Birkenhead, Cheshire, the elder son of James Knox (1871&#150;1956), Congregational minister of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, and his wife, Isabella Russell Marshall. His parents were both of Scottish descent, and although he was educated in England, Knox was always strongly conscious of his Scottish roots. His first wife (whom he married in 1927), Margaret Normana McLeod Smith, came from Tarbert, Harris, and this underlined the Scottish attachment. Bury grammar school and the Liverpool Institute provided the principal elements of his early education. A scholarship at Pembroke College, Oxford, was followed by a first in <i>literae humaniores</i>. In 1923 he became secretary to the first Lord Leverhulme, and this connection with Lever Brothers was continued in various secretarial and executive positions in firms managing the conglomerate's west African interests, 1925&#150;31. Not long after the tragically early death of his wife, in 1930, he returned to academic life at Oxford, first as bursar and lecturer in philosophy at Jesus College, where his experience in business was combined with his scholarly prowess, and subsequently as fellow and lecturer in Greek philosophy at Queen's College. In 1934 he married Dorothy Ellen Jolly (<i>d</i>. 1974) of Thornton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, who was a much cherished companion and hostess. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>By 1936 Knox was ready for a major move, which entailed his &#145;spiritual return&#146; to Scotland and his appointment to the chair of moral philosophy in the University of St Andrews. Henceforth his entire career, until his retirement in 1966, was spent at, and indeed devoted to, Scotland's most ancient seat of learning, assisted by his wife, who became chatelaine of University House, St Andrews. The older and more conservative tradition of teaching and of &#145;doing&#146; philosophy was then still alive at St Andrews, and this trend was eminently suited to Knox's mindset and experience. He rapidly acquired the reputation of an excellent and exacting teacher and that of a man of affairs in the administration of the university. It was largely due to those latter attainments that he was elected to the court of the university (the governing body in Scottish universities), which gave him a position of influence in academic and administrative developments.<br>
<br>When the health of Sir James Irvine, the principal and vice-chancellor of St Andrews, began to fail, Knox became the obvious choice to step into the breach as deputy (subsequently acting) principal (1951&#150;3), and this led eventually (1953) to the substantive appointment as vice-chancellor and principal of the university. Now fully in charge, he embarked at once on some overdue reforms: he arranged for the words &#145;to engage in research&#146; to be written retrospectively into the contracts of all lecturers and readers, where the pursuit of research (in contrast to professorial contracts) had (deliberately?) been omitted. He took immense trouble over professorial appointments in particular: the first two chairs to fall vacant during his term of office were those of Greek (filled by Kenneth Dover, later chancellor of St Andrews University) and of moral philosophy, Knox's own former chair, now to be occupied by A. D. Woozley. He saw to it that the academic reputation of St Andrews University was re-established in all its ancient glory.<br>
<br>Two further problems required Knox's most urgent attention. The financial situation of the university was extremely precarious and needed immediate amelioration. His financial skills and tough governance succeeded in placing the university's fiscal position on a sound footing in record time. Furthermore, the relationship between St Andrews and its constituent college at Dundee had long been tense. Knox managed to reconcile the two sectors of the university by winning the confidence of his Dundee colleagues, who became the new principal's keenest supporters. Yet the Robbins report on higher education (1964) and the virtual doubling of the number of British universities led inexorably to the establishment in 1966 of Dundee as an independent university. Knox, with characteristic excess of rectitude, saw in this development the failure of his stewardship and decided&#151;quite unnecessarily&#151;to resign at the same time.<br>
<br>Knox's principalship had been a marked success. He himself had set an example in thrifty administration and in the continuance of his scholarship&#151;despite heavy burdens of management. He worked hard himself in order to persuade his colleagues to engage in research rather than waste their time in committees. He favoured old-fashioned academic virtues and preferred minimalism to gratuitous expansion of the sort proposed by the report of the Robbins committee. He enjoined his closest friends to see to it that any future memoir written about him should contain the words of opprobrium (considered by him as praise), uttered by a highly placed leader of academe at a meeting of the vice-chancellors and principals committee in the early 1960s, that he was &#145;an academic dinosaur&#146;. He was knighted in 1961, and a number of honorary doctorates were conferred on him.<br>
<br>Knox's extra-curricular <i>savoir-faire</i> imposed on him demands to serve on a number of government-appointed commissions, such as the Catering Wages Commission, the national reference tribunal for the UK coal industry, the Scottish Tourist Board, the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland, and the review body on doctors' and dentists' remuneration. He was also chairman of governors of Morrison's academy, Crieff. His academic duties and pleasures were never neglected, especially not his work on Hegel, to which he remained single-mindedly devoted. Thus he was invited to deliver the prestigious Gifford lectures at Aberdeen University (1965&#150;8) and was elected to membership (later to the vice-presidency) of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Knox owed his initial interest in Hegelianism to his father, who had studied under Edward Caird at Glasgow. He first began to explore the wider implications of Hegelianism during his undergraduate years at Pembroke, when he came under the influence of Robin Collingwood. Caird had brought out its theological significance, its capacity for countering destructive scepticism, for reanimating moral and religious convictions, for resolving the apparent conflict between science and faith. Collingwood, while he was tutoring Knox, was in the process of thinking through what he had learned from immersing himself in the Italian tradition, in the writings of Vico, Croce, and Ruggiero&#151;in clarifying his ideas on truth and error, on aesthetics, and on the relationship between history and philosophy.<br>
<br>It was this spectrum of general preoccupations which established the framework for the whole of Knox's subsequent approach to Hegel studies. When he returned to Oxford in 1931, he was concerned primarily with the interdisciplinary potential of Hegel's systematic work&#151;he gave lectures on the <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, and prepared but did not publish an article on the <span class="italic">Philosophy of Nature</span>. By 1932 he had begun to appreciate the importance of the work Dilthey and Lasson had done on Hegel's development, especially on account of the light it threw on the mature conception of the relationship between ethics, politics, and religion. It was this that came to dominate his thinking, and the publication of Michael Foster's book on the political philosophies of Plato and Hegel (1935) which finally persuaded him to start work on a new translation of the <span class="italic">Philosophy of Right</span>.<br>
<br>At the time, concerning oneself with Hegel's political philosophy was bound to create a stir and give rise to criticism, and in 1940 (<span class="italic">Philosophy</span>, 15, 1940, 51&#150;63) Knox felt obliged to publish an article on &#145;Hegel and Prussianism&#146;, in which he pointed out the foolishness of simply writing this philosophy off as a glorification of the state and a precursor of Nazism. The publication of the translation by the Clarendon Press in 1942 proved to be a milestone in the development of British Hegel studies, since for the very first time one of the key texts was presented with a full-scale commentary, placing the subject matter in its historical context and analysing the cogency of the expositions.<br>
<br>It was this work, which he brought out in a revised edition in 1945 and which was then reissued five times over the next twenty years, which established Knox as the leading authority on Hegelianism in the English-speaking world. He followed it up by co-operating with Richard Kroner on an edition of the <span class="italic">Early Theological Writings</span>, published in America in 1948, and with his pupil Zbigniew Pelczynski, tutor and lecturer at Pembroke College, Oxford, on a corresponding edition of Hegel's minor <span class="italic">Political Writings</span>, published by the Clarendon Press in 1964. He also continued to cultivate his wider interests, planning a comprehensive account of Hegel's development, preparing a draft translation of parts of Boumann's edition of the <span class="italic">Philosophy of Subjective Spirit</span>, and after his retirement working steadily on the <span class="italic">Aesthetics</span>, the two magnificent volumes of which he finally saw through the press in 1974. During his last years he was working on the standard text of the lectures on the history of philosophy.<br>
<br>Knox had decided views on the general philosophical significance of attempting to create an informed and up-to-date Hegelian culture in the English-speaking world. He was anything but enthusiastic about the growing preoccupation with the phenomenological approach and, when G. R. G. Mure's study of the <span class="italic">Logic</span> appeared in 1950, greeted it with a suitably appreciative review (<span class="italic">Philosophy</span>, 26, 1951, 180&#150;83). He stated publicly, thirty-five years after the event, that when he first read the <span class="italic">Tractatus logico-philosophicus</span> soon after its publication, the book made no impression on his mind whatever:<blockquote>It seemed to me to be ingenious, to be about problems other than those with which in my study of philosophy I was trying to grapple, and to be not altogether exempt from what I took to be philosophical errors. If I had been told at that time that in the course of forty years I would see philosophical and historical theology eclipsed and find the philosophical scene dominated by doctrines which owed far more to Wittgenstein than to my own masters in the subject, I would have been altogether incredulous. (&#145;Two conceptions of philosophy&#146;, <span class="italic">Philosophy</span>, 36, 1961, 289&#150;308)</blockquote>During his retirement Knox did all he could to further what he saw as worthwhile developments in Hegel studies, and in 1978 made a substantial financial contribution to the founding of the Hegel Society of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Knox was stocky with a markedly round head and strong rimless glasses. The obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> rightly pronounced him &#145;a wily committee-man, a coiner of sharp aphorisms, and a master of formidable silences&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Once convinced of someone's loyalty, he gave his friendship unstintingly. His musical knowledge and tastes were discriminating; he played the piano well; theology and a wide range of history and literature mattered to him; vintage claret was much favoured&#151;as was the company of a select circle of close friends. He died of cancer at his home, 19 Victoria Terrace, Crieff, Perthshire, on 6 April 1980 and was buried at Perth on 10 April.<br>
