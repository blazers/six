<span class="headword">Pollard,  (Henry) Graham</span>  (1903&#150;1976), <span class="occ">bookseller and bibliographer</span>, was born at 85 Erpingham Road, Putney, London, on 7 March 1903. His father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35556/', "Albert Frederick Pollard (1869&#150;1948)")</script>, historian and first director of the Institute of Historical Research; his mother, Catherine Susanna 
    (Katie; <i>d</i>. 1934)
  , was the daughter of William Lucy, of the Eagle ironworks, Oxford. Pollard had one sister, who became the wife of Harold Edgeworth Butler, professor of Latin at University College, London. His formal education began in 1909 at Willington preparatory school in Putney. In 1916 he gained an exhibition to Shrewsbury School. His housemaster at Shrewsbury was J. B. Oldham, subsequently a respected historian of bookbindings, who clearly stimulated and encouraged Pollard's bibliographic interests. While at Shrewsbury Pollard wrote verse and was active in the debating society, but his father was not happy with these pursuits and in 1920 he spent a year studying history at University College, London. In 1921 he was elected to an open scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, to read history, and gained a third-class degree in 1924. None the less he made his mark at Oxford: debating; contributing to and editing the <span class="italic">New Oxford</span>, for the Oxford University Labour Club; and as a precocious book collector. When Thomas James Wise was admitted to an honorary fellowship at Worcester College, he was taken to see the undergraduate's collection. A. L. Rowse remembered his rooms looking &#145;more like a bookseller's shop&#146; and spoke of &#145;a glorious collection of books&#146;  (Rowse, 81). Before taking his finals Pollard had bought David Garnett's share in Birrell and Garnett, booksellers at 30 Gerrard Street, London.<br>
<br>On 30 July 1924 Pollard married Kathleen May (Kay) Beauchamp (1899&#150;1992), daughter of George Henry Beauchamp, who came from a long line of Somerset farmers and colliery owners. A pupil of Pollard's father, having read history at University College, she became a lifelong member of the Communist Party. Pollard also joined the party, running the St Pancras branch of the Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks and editing the <span class="italic">Distributive Worker</span>. Throughout the general strike he played a role in the St Pancras area of London but as the twenties progressed, and his wife's enthusiasm for communism and the Soviet Union grew, Pollard's active political interests declined. In 1930 Kay Beauchamp made an extended visit to the Soviet Union and the marriage was, in effect, over by August 1931, though there was no official divorce until 1972.<br>
<br>Birrell and Garnett was to provide Pollard with his true bibliographical education. In 1927 the business became a limited company with Jane E. Norton as chairman and Pollard as managing director. Throughout the twenties and thirties an impressive series of catalogues was produced; that on type specimens became a standard work of reference. Another on early writing books would probably have enjoyed the same status, but was never printed, the collection having been sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Early newspapers and colonial printing reflected Pollard's bibliographic interests alongside English literature and Jane Norton's leanings towards economic theory and social conditions of the early nineteenth century. The immense range of knowledge acquired by Pollard in these fields was demonstrated in his contributions to <span class="italic">The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</span>.<br>
<br>Pollard was meeting and collaborating with the more important members of the bibliographical world. He quickly became a friend of Stanley Morison. In the early thirties he became involved with John Johnson, Strickland Gibson, and others at Oxford, and joined them on the editorial board of <span class="roman">Oxford Books on Bibliography</span>. Lectures given to bibliographical societies led to important and influential articles, particularly on the early history of the Stationers' Company and the book trade in medieval Oxford. His collaboration with John Carter and their publication of <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</span> (1934) sent shock waves through the bibliographical establishment and unveiled T. J. Wise as a scoundrel and cheat. It provided not only a classic example of bibliographical scholarship but a gripping detective story.<br>
<br>It is unlikely that the bookshop ever made much money, and Pollard was not a businessman. In March 1939 the partnership ended, the new book department being sold to Quaritch. At this point, most probably through the mediation of Stanley Morison, Pollard was appointed a special lecturer in the history of the newspaper at University College, London. The commencement of the war, however, limited his activities to a few lectures and seminars until he joined the Board of Trade as a temporary principal in April 1942. One of his classic articles, &#145;Notes on the size of the sheet&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">The Library</span> in 1942.<br>
<br>Although Pollard's was originally a temporary appointment, at the end of the war he stayed on at the Board of Trade until retiring in 1959. His career mainly involved running the organization and methods branch of the Board of Trade, but it included working under Harold Wilson on the removal of many controls after the war; a spell on loan to the machinery of government branch at the Treasury; and, towards the end of his career, involvement in negotiations for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. The knowledge he gained of trade and commerce during this stage of his career vastly increased his understanding of how the book trade had operated through the centuries. Bibliographical work did not cease during this period: his edition of <span class="italic">The Earliest Directory of the Book Trade, by John Pendred, 1785</span>, with its invaluable introduction and appendices, was published in 1955; and in the final months before retirement he gave the Sandars lectures at Cambridge, <span class="italic">The English Market for Printed Books</span>.<br>
<br>In October 1940 Pollard had moved to Barton Manor, a house on the edge of Oxford, which he made his base for the remainder of his life, proximity to the Bodleian Library being an important reason for his choice. At the Board of Trade he had met Esther Potter, who became his lifelong companion, and together they had a flat in London at Blackheath, full of wonderful books and the scene of memorable bibliographical entertainment.<br>
<br>The years of his retirement began with his serving as president of the [London] Bibliographical Society (1960&#150;62), and during his tenure he presented the society's gold medal to his old housemaster, J. B. Oldham. In 1961, as reader in bibliography at Oxford, he gave the Lyell lectures; in these he returned to a favourite topic&#151;the medieval Oxford book trade. Work continued on the revision of the <span class="italic">Enquiry</span>; &#145;working papers&#146; were published, but the revision was never finished by Carter or Pollard. With Albert Ehrman he produced <span class="italic">The distribution of books by catalogue from the invention of printing to A.D. 1800, based on material in the Broxbourne Library</span> (1965) for presentation by Ehrman to members of the Roxburghe Club. Another major project, from which he derived much pleasure but which remained unfinished at his death, was a catalogue of the books at Waddesdon Manor. In 1969 he was himself presented with the Bibliographical Society's gold medal during the presidency of his old friend John Carter. He made his one and only lecture tour to the United States in 1973. The year 1975 saw the Oxford Bibliographical Society publish a volume of essays in his honour entitled <span class="italic">Studies in the Book Trade</span>, which contained an appreciation by John Carter and a photographic portrait of him at that time. Pollard died at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford on 15 November 1976, having read a paper on another of his favourite topics, the pecia system, in Durham only a few weeks earlier.<br>
