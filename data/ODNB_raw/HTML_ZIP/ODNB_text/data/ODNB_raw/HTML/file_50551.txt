<span class="headword">Dudley, Sir  William Edward</span>  (1868&#150;1938), <span class="occ">co-operative society administrator</span>, was born on 29 May 1868 at 1 Loch Street, Runcorn, Cheshire, the son of William Dudley, house painter, and his wife, Rebecca Cottrell. Dudley attended Runcorn parish church school until 1883, when he began work with Bridgewater Navigation as an office boy. Dudley transferred to the engineer's office, which he eventually headed. He was prominent in local public life as a leading churchman and, from 1914, as an independent member of Runcorn urban district council. Dudley was council chairman in 1921&#150;3; he also served as an overseer of the poor and a JP, and he was involved with numerous local societies and charities.<br>
<br>Born into a family already involved in co-operative trading, Dudley joined the Runcorn Co-operative Society in 1893, on his marriage to Theresa Sutton (<i>d</i>. 1927). In 1895 he was elected to the society's management committee, and in 1896 he became chairman. Dudley directed the reform of the society, which enjoyed unprecedented growth.<br>
<br>Dudley had larger ambitions to co-operative leadership. He campaigned for better representation for the Cheshire and north Wales district within the north-western section of the Co-operative Union, and he took the new seat created on its board in 1904. By 1911 he was chairman of the union's central board, and he oversaw revision of the Co-operative Union's rules at congress. This success assisted his election to the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) board in the same year. Dudley then resigned from Bridgewater Navigation and as chairman of Runcorn and Widnes Co-operative Society.<br>
<br>Dudley served on the grocery committee of the CWS, acting as chairman from 1916. He was central to co-operative attempts to influence government food controls during the First World War. In 1918 Dudley was one of six co-operative nominees to the consumers' council at the Ministry of Food. He served on fourteen wartime government departmental committees and helped to revise post-war import restrictions. He served on the royal commission on food prices of 1924 and the National Food Council established in 1925.<br>
<br>Dudley was appointed CWS president in 1933, overseeing an operation with sales of around &pound;100 million. His presidency saw extension into storekeeping, through the formation of the CWS Retail Society in 1934. From 1919 Dudley represented the CWS as a director of the Manchester Ship Canal and from 1930 he chaired the committee controlling Bridgewater Navigation. He was also a director of Bridgewater and Manchester collieries. Dudley was honoured through election as president of the 1925 Co-operative Congress. He was appointed OBE in 1920 for his work with the Ministry of Food and a knighthood in 1926. Dudley was in addition decorated by the governments of the CWS's trading partners, particularly of Denmark and Quebec.<br>
<br>Dudley's health was already failing at his retirement as CWS president in 1936. He died on 7 May 1938 at his Runcorn home, Cranleigh, Weston Road. Lady Dudley had died in 1927, but he was survived by his son and daughter. His funeral, on 11 May, at Runcorn parish church, was attended by co-operative and civic dignitaries. Dudley's energy as a self-made man was combined with a practical view of co-operation: &#145;I am for doing one job well, and my business is to improve and extend co-operative trading&#146;  (Co-operative Union, <span class="italic">57th Congress</span>, 348).<br>
