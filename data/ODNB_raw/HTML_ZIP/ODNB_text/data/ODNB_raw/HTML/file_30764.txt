<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ardizzone,  Edward Jeffery Irving</span>  (1900&#150;1979), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born on 16 October 1900 in Haiphong, French Indo-China. He was the eldest child of Auguste Ardizzone (<i>d</i>. 1942), a naturalized Frenchman of Italian parentage, an employee of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company and his wife, Margaret (1875&#150;1959), the daughter of Edward Alexander Irving, assistant colonial secretary at Singapore. Unusually for a young woman at the time, Margaret Irving had studied painting at Colorossi's in Paris before her marriage. Auguste and Margaret Ardizzone had four further children, two daughters and two sons, all French by birth; Edward Ardizzone became a naturalized Englishman in 1922. Taken to England in 1905, Ardizzone spent his childhood in East Anglia at various residences, often under the charge of his maternal grandmother when his mother was away in the Far East. His early education was with a governess in East Bergholt and then at Ipswich grammar school, where he was badly bullied. In 1912, after another family move to Wokingham, he became a boarder at Clayesmore School. This slightly unorthodox, undenominational school has been seen as an odd choice for one who was brought up, and remained, a Roman Catholic, but it was here that his growing interest in drawing and painting was encouraged. Furthermore, his housemaster, the novelist Desmond Coke (1879&#150;1931), was later to play a useful role in helping him to find commissions as a freelance artist.<br>
<br>After leaving school in 1918, and trying twice unsuccessfully to enlist, Ardizzone spent six months at a college of commerce in Bath and for several years afterwards worked as a clerk in Warminster and London. His lengthiest employment was with the Eastern Telegraph Company in London, where his father had bought no. 130 Elgin Avenue, which was to become the family home for over fifty years, figuring frequently in Ardizzone's illustrations and on his personal Christmas cards. During his period of clerkship he attended Bernard Meninsky's evening classes at the Westminster School of Art, devoting his weekends to painting. In 1926, following a gift of &pound;500 from his father, he gave up his job to concentrate upon a career as a professional artist. On 2 April 1929 he married Catherine Josephine Berkley (1904&#150;1992), the daughter of William Cuthbert Anderson, chief auditor of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In the years up to 1939 Ardizzone worked hard as both painter and graphic artist. In a series of one-man shows, first at the Bloomsbury Gallery and then at the Leger Galleries, his very personal, domestic vision received considerable praise. Working chiefly in his favourite medium of watercolour, but also in oils and lithography (for monochrome prints), he celebrated the local life of his quarter of London, Maida Vale: recreations in its parks and along the Regent's Canal, the bonhomie of its pubs and its night-life. He brought to these scenes a mixture of affection, wit, and gentle satire which places him firmly in the tradition of Thomas Rowlandson.<br>
<br>Ardizzone's deep appreciation of the values of narrative art is reflected too in his illustrations of this period: the lengthy suite of pen-drawings for his first major commission, <span class="italic">In a Glass Darkly</span> by J. Sheridan Le Fanu (1929), drawings for the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span> (which, with <span class="italic">Punch</span>, was to be a regular source of income), advertising copy for the whisky merchants Johnnie Walker, and picture books which he wrote and illustrated himself. The first of these, <span class="italic">Little Tim and the Brave Sea Captain</span> (1936), arose from stories told to his own family. It draws on memories of the harbour at Ipswich and upon his liking for ships and the sea, and in its bold integration of word and picture it stands out as one of the most significant picture books of the age. (It was, too, an early example of colour offset lithography. Its spacious folios were printed in the United States, where the text was hand-lettered by Grace Allen Hogarth, an editor at the Oxford University Press New York office.) The complete colour draft of this first book is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. His next book, <span class="italic">Lucy Brown and Mr Grimes</span> (1937), was less successful, and had to be recast for American publication.<br>
<br>At the start of the Second World War in 1939 Ardizzone was serving in an anti-aircraft regiment, but in 1940 he was appointed an official war artist and was attached to the British army's general headquarters at Arras. A published record of his experiences during the German invasion of France is to be found in his book <span class="italic">Baggage to the Enemy</span> (1941), just as his further work during the North African and Italian campaigns is recorded in his <span class="italic">Diary of a War Artist</span> (1974). Over 300 watercolours from this time are housed at the Imperial War Museum.<br>
<br>After the war Ardizzone resumed his freelance career with great energy. He regularly exhibited drawings, watercolours, and lithographs at the Leicester Gallery and at the gallery of his friend Freddy Mayor; he undertook a variety of commissions, ranging from a watercolour portrait of Sir Winston Churchill to a notable series of covers for <span class="italic">The Strand</span> magazine, and advertising brochures for Ealing Studios and Messrs Guinness; and he illustrated nearly 200 books, winning the Library Association's Kate Greenaway medal in 1957 for <span class="italic">Tim All Alone</span> (1956). His chosen medium for these varied from the line and wash drawings which he made for his own picture books, to pure line, as in his intensely imagined drawings for poems by Walter de la Mare and by his friend James Reeves, and to more elaborate processes, such as the lithographs and stencilled drawings done for the Limited Editions Club of New York.<br>
<br>The foundation for this prolific output was Ardizzone's complete mastery of the drawn line. Although he claimed that &#145;the born illustrator&#146; should work from copies rather than from life, his sketchbooks testify to his continuous dedication to catching with his pen the significant moments of the life around him. Out of such constant practice there grew a body of finished work that pictures with grace and with a deceptive ease the scenes and incidents of anything from mechanized war to a child's dream of toyland. Only towards the end of his life was there any slackening of his fluent control of the drawn line. On the death of his widow, Catherine, in 1992 his sixty-four sketchbooks were accepted by the government in lieu of inheritance tax and deposited in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>In addition to his creative work, Ardizzone was an instructor in graphic design at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, London. Then, after a tour of south India for UNESCO in 1952, training students in silk-screen printing, he became visiting tutor in etching and lithography at the Royal College of Art. Such variety of occupation was congenial to him, for he loved company and was held in much affection by a wide circle of friends. He also loved good food and wine, a taste reflected in his designing of menu covers for restaurants and catalogues for wine shippers, and in his writing and illustrating wine notes for the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>In 1960 Ardizzone retired from teaching and spent more time in Kent, where he bought a house at Rodmersham Green, Sittingbourne. In 1972 he and his wife moved there permanently. He was elected ARA in 1962 and RA in 1970, serving on the hanging committee in 1969 and 1971. Among the many honours he received were appointments as CBE in 1971 and royal designer for industry in 1974. Despite declining health, he continued to work at painting and illustrating until his death of a heart attack at his home, 5 Vine Cottages, Rodmersham Green, on 8 November 1979. He was buried at Rodmersham church on 11 November.<br>
