<span class="headword">Aufrere,  Anthony</span>  (1756&#150;1833), <span class="occ">translator and antiquary in Europe</span>, was the eldest son of Anthony Aufrere (1730&#150;1814), landowner and magistrate, of Hoveton Hall, Norfolk, and Anna (1735&#150;1816), the only daughter of John Norris (<i>d</i>. 1734), of Witton, Norfolk, and Anna Carthew. His mother was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20279/', "John Norris (1733/4&#150;1777)")</script>, founder of the Norrisian professorship at Cambridge. Little is known about Aufrere's early life, but by 1785 he was forced to leave his home of Old Foulsham Hall in Norfolk and to flee the country to escape his creditors, his debts having &#145;exceeded all Reason&#146;  (Ingamells, 34). He travelled widely in Italy, where, in Pisa, he met General James Lockhart, of Lee and Carnwath, and his daughter Marianna. On 19 February 1791 he married Marianna, with whom he had two children, George and Louisa. His son married the youngest daughter of a Hamburg merchant named Whertman, and his daughter married George Barclay, a New York merchant.<br>
<br>By 1792 Aufrere and his wife were living in Heidelberg, and the following year they moved to Mannheim. From an early age Aufrere had showed a great aptitude for learning languages, and he published several translations. His first publication was <span class="italic">A Tribute to the Memory of Ulric of Hutten</span> (1795), translated from a work then attributed to Goethe, but now known to have been by Herder. In 1795 he translated a German work by Anton von Salis-Marschlins, published as <span class="italic">Travels through Various Provinces of the Kingdom of Naples, in 1789</span>, and in 1822 an Italian work by Paolo della Cella, published as <span class="italic">Narrative of an Expedition from Tripoli &hellip; to the Western Frontier of Egypt</span>. A small work which attracted much attention was his <span class="italic">Warning to Britons against French perfidy and cruelty, or, A short account of the treacherous and inhuman conduct of the French officers and soldiers towards the peasants of Suabia, during the invasion of Germany in 1796</span> (1798), which was reprinted several times. Aufrere was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> under the pseudonym of Viator A, but his most significant work was his edition of the letters and papers of George Lockhart and other Jacobites at the time of the risings of 1715 and 1745. He had been entrusted with this task by his brother-in-law Charles Lockhart, Count Lockhart, in 1799, and the papers were published in two volumes in 1817. Aufrere, who returned to Pisa in 1815, died there on 29 November 1833, aged seventy-six, and was survived by his wife.<br>
