<span class="headword">Knight <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>St John]</span>,  Henrietta</span>, Lady Luxborough  (1699&#150;1756), <span class="occ">poet and letter writer</span>, was born at Lydiard Park, Wiltshire, on 15 July 1699, the only daughter of Henry, first Viscount St John (1652&#150;1742), and his second wife, Angelica Magdalene Pellisary (<i>c</i>.1666&#150;1736), a French widow. Henrietta's half-brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24496/', "Henry St John, first Viscount Bolingbroke (1678&#150;1751)")</script>, with whom she remained in contact even in her most difficult years. She spent her early life at the St Johns' house at Battersea after Bolingbroke's attainder and flight to France in 1715. Scandal touched her name for the first time in 1719, but on 10 June 1727 she married Robert Knight (1702&#150;1772), later Baron Luxborough. They travelled regularly to France, where Robert Knight senior had fled at the collapse of the South Sea Company from which, as cashier, he made a huge illegal fortune.<br>
<br>Immediately after her marriage Henrietta was suspected of having an affair with her London physician, Dr Charles Peters (1695&#150;1746). She and Robert Knight had two children, Henry (<i>b</i>. 1728) and Henrietta (<i>b</i>. 1729). She was accused by her husband of having also become pregnant by a young cleric, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7061/', "John Dalton (bap. 1709, d. 1763)")</script>, tutor in the household of her friend Frances Seymour, countess of Hertford. She appears to have given birth late in 1736. In that year Knight arranged a separation order from his wife, having found her love letters to Dalton. She was obliged to live on &pound;500 a year at Barrells, Ullenhall, a Knight estate in a remote part of Warwickshire, never to see her children, or to visit London and Bath. A remarkable monument in a local parish church, set up by Knight, commemorated Henry and Henrietta as her only offspring with her husband. His bitterness towards his wife never diminished.<br>
<br>Isolated in Warwickshire, Henrietta relied on correspondents to keep in touch with contemporary affairs. Her attempts to be reconciled with Knight failed and, for some time, she was ostracized by the best local society. However, she became friendly with the poet William Shenstone (1714&#150;1763) of The Leasowes, Worcestershire, and with others, including Richard Jago (1715&#150;1781) and William Somervile (1675&#150;1742). They formed the &#145;Warwickshire coterie&#146;; she was known in their literary circle as Asteria. Much of her correspondence with Shenstone (1742&#150;55) discussed garden design, literature, decor, and architecture, and they exchanged several visits. At Barrells she created a <i>ferme orn&eacute;e</i>, with many rare plants, exotic birds, and fowl. She was slowly accepted into midland society as visitors came to view the gardens at Barrells. She continued to correspond regularly with Bolingbroke until his death. Her married daughter was also involved in a scandal, eloping and being divorced in 1753.<br>
<br>Lady Luxborough's portraits show her to be a strikingly beautiful woman, although an unfashionable brunette, and Walpole's description of her as &#145;lusty&#146; and high-coloured, with a &#145;great black bush of hair&#146; is both accurate and spiteful  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 32.243&#150;4). Some of her poems, given to the publisher Robert Dodsley by Shenstone, were published in the 1775 edition of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span>, and much of her correspondence with Shenstone was published in 1775 and with the duchess of Somerset in 1778. In the last years of her life when she was ill, she finally visited Bath in 1752, and was also attended by Dr John Wall (1708&#150;1766) of Worcester. From about 1750 she was in severe financial difficulties, and her friendship with Shenstone appears to have cooled shortly before her death at Barrells on 26 March 1756. She was buried at St Peter's, Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire.<br>
