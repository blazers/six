<span class="headword">Lambe,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1711, <em>d.</em> 1795), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was baptized at St Nicholas's Church, Durham, on 15 August 1711, the son of John Lambe, mercer, of Durham. He was educated at Durham grammar school and at St John's College, Cambridge, whence he matriculated in 1728 and graduated BA in 1734. He was ordained deacon at Lincoln on 23 September 1733 and priest at Norwich in October 1735, whereupon he was appointed a minor canon of Durham Cathedral. In 1747 he obtained the curacy of South Shields and a few weeks later received the living of Norham, Northumberland, which had become vacant. He remained at Norham for the rest of his life and married there, on 11 April 1755, Philadelphia Nelson (<i>d</i>. 1772), the daughter of a Durham carrier. According to James Raine's account of his courtship Lambe had seen her only once, many years before he suddenly decided to propose. In his proposal letter he invited her to meet him on Berwick pier and asked her to carry a tea caddy so that he could identify her; he then absent-mindedly failed to meet her on the appointed day but none the less his suit was successful. The couple had a daughter, Philadelphia (<i>b</i>. 1756), who married Alexander Robertson of Berwick, and two sons, Robert (1759&#150;1771), and Ralph, who died in infancy in 1764.<br>
<br>Lambe's publications reflect his wide-ranging historical interests; the first was <span class="italic">The History of Chess</span> (1764; 2nd edn, 1765). His principal work, <span class="italic">An Exact and Circumstantial History of the Battle of Flodden</span> (1774), appears to have been based on Thomas Gent's edition of a manuscript belonging to John Askew of Pallinsburn, Northumberland, and was embellished with Lambe's notes, which, he claimed, recorded authentic historical events. However, stories such as his description of St Cuthbert's body floating down the Tweed in a stone coffin were the product of his mischievous imagination. Likewise he maintained that his poem &#145;The Laidley Worm of Spindleston Heugh&#146; was translated from a song composed by a mystical bard living in the Cheviots in the thirteenth century. This hoax fooled William Hutchinson, who included the poem in his history of Northumberland, and some of Lambe's purported archaeological discoveries were also practical jokes intended to catch out his fellow antiquaries.<br>
<br>Lambe died at Edinburgh on 7 May 1795 and was buried in Eyemouth churchyard, Berwickshire. His wife, who had predeceased him, had been buried at Gilligate, Durham, on 13 January 1772.<br>
