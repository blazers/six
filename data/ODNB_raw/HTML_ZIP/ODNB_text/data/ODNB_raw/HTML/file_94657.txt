<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dosunmu,  Samson Olabowale <span class="st"> [Ola]</span></span>  (1914&#150;1991?), <span class="occ">gambler and nightclub proprietor</span>, was born on 6 October 1914 in the Ijebu region of south-western Nigeria, the son of Dosunmu Adenowa, a farmer. His parents were Ijebu-Yoruba. He was related to a hereditary chieftancy in the Delo-Dosunmu family of Shagamu and to a prominent dynasty established by Ajayi Jegede, a wealthy Ijebu trader. He spent his early years in Ijebu-Ode then moved to Lagos, where he lived under the supervision of an older half-brother, Chief Gilbert Idowu Delo-Dosunmu (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1897), the aro of Shagamu. Although the chief would become a significant figure in Ijebu affairs, in Lagos he was a petty trader and moneylender until he amassed the capital to buy a hotel. From the start Dosunmu was made aware that life was a struggle. As a youngster he was seldom away from the waterside, where he learned to swim out to the cargo boats at their moorings to see what might be &#145;liberated&#146; at night. He joined other Raleigh boys (as they were known, after the brand of bicycle to which they aspired) in the nightly crowd around the shops of the palm-wine sellers in Williams Street; there he met the singer and percussionist Ambrose Campbell and the guitarist Brewster Hughes as they listened to older seamen tell tales and play music. He became a popular figure and by the start of the 1930s he had learned the art of the street magician: &#145;He take stick, he can throw it up in the air and turn it into a snake. People, they come and surround them. They have the secret, those people&#146;  (private information, A. Lemoshe).<br>
<br>Despite limited formal education, Dosunmu acquired status from the extended Dosunmu-Ajayi family in which several of the Ajayis achieved academic distinction. He chose to reject this connection with the Lagosian &eacute;lite, however, and left home instead to explore the world. Working his way along the coast of west Africa as a seaman, he survived by putting his trickster skills into practice. In Freetown, Sierra Leone, he practised &#145;native medicine&#146; before travelling to Britain, arriving on the eve of the Second World War. He did wartime service as a fireman and donkeyman on merchant ships, and, between gruelling spells in the stokehold, he established himself in London's West End. There he honed his card-playing skills and rolled dice in illegal gambling &#145;spielers&#146;. By 1944 he was living in Fitzrovia, a cosmopolitan quarter where people of colour had lodged since the inter-war years. With the onset of the bombing many residents departed, but what was tragedy for some was beneficial for others, and properties left vacant were ripe for exploitation by individuals with the entrepreneurial spirit. Dosunmu was one of these.<br>
<br>While working as a croupier for the Sierra Leonean gambler Ernest Marke, Dosunmu was involved in a notorious incident in the immediate aftermath of the war. When white American soldiers attacked black men in the street outside Marke's Soho club the two gamblers struggled to barricade the doors and keep the ruffians at bay. Eventually the club was closed by the police, but it was through working for Marke that Dosunmu acquired the money to start an enterprise of his own. He was encouraged by an adventurous young woman from Leeds who was serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service when they met. This was Irene (Rene) Stevens (<i>c</i>.1925&#150;1972), the daughter of John Peter Louis Stevens, steel erector; she became Marke's barmaid on returning to civilian life, and married Dosunmu on 1 December 1947, at St Pancras register office. Known by the Yoruba name of Abeni, she embraced Yoruba culture and learned to speak the language. She cooked Nigerian food and dressed in the Yoruba woman's costume of <i>buba</i>, <i>lappa</i>, and <i>gele</i>; so effective were her dress and demeanour that one English visitor remarked &#145;I always thought of her as Nigerian&#146;  (private information, J. Sikuade).<br>
<br>In Soho Dosunmu ran gambling clubs where African food was on offer alongside illegal card-playing and dice. The impact of music was not considered until he opened the Abalabi in Berwick Street. It was there that he made his name by featuring Ambrose Campbell's band playing dreamy Nigerian highlife on guitars and drums. As diplomats, students, d&eacute;butantes, writers, and artists danced and mingled with gamblers and Soho riff-raff, it was there, too, that many white English people encountered African culture, two decades before the sights, sounds, and tastes of Africa became more widely available in British cities. Colin MacInnes immortalized the Abalabi (&#145;the Beni Bronze&#146;) in <span class="italic">City of Spades</span>, his tale of a young Nigerian adventurer in London. Jazz musicians were frequenters, too, notably the rhythmically intelligent Phil Seamen who passed on what he learned to the next generation of drummers.<br>
<br>In 1957 Dosunmu moved upmarket with the well-appointed Club Afrique in Wardour Street, and adopted the name Chief Delo-Dosunmu. He hired Ghanaian and Caribbean musicians as well as Nigerians, and the trumpeter Fela Ransome-Kuti, founder of Afro-beat, who was taking a break from his formal music studies to play jazz. Despite the club's popularity and distinguished supporters&#151;among them members of the Moroccan royal family and Lord Listowel, governor-general of Ghana&#151;the Dosunmus were pursued relentlessly for breaches of the arcane licensing laws and fined. It was a situation all black entrepreneurs faced&#151;which makes Dosunmu's longevity all the more remarkable.<br>
<br>Short and broadly built, Dosunmu faced the world with a quizzical expression and, as befits a successful gambler, kept his own counsel. Dealing with police corruption and organized crime was a necessity, but through his ingenuity and staying power, and with Abeni's support, he elevated the status of the black club owner. He kept in touch with events in Africa, acknowledging major landmarks at the club, and raised contributions towards the defence of Nelson Mandela and others in the South African treason trials of 1956&#150;61.<br>
<br>Dosunmu was the father of Olatokunboh (Tokunboh), a son born in London in 1959 to Simone Bashorun, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fallet, the wife of Anjos Adetola Bashorun. Olatokunboh was brought up by Ola and Abeni Dosunmu, and when they returned to Nigeria in 1960 he accompanied them as their adopted son. In Lagos Dosunmu assumed management of his late brother's hotel, and opened another two clubs. With Abeni's death in 1972 Dosunmu lost his helpmeet of a quarter of a century; he continued to run his enterprises but was unable to equal her spirit and verve. When his business declined, he surprised those who knew him by devoting time to his local Methodist church and organizing its social events. He remarried in Nigeria following Abeni's death and was the father of Adewale, a son born in Lagos. He died in Lagos, probably in 1991.<br>
