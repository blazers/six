</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans,  Gwynfor Richard</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 September 1912 at Y Goedwig, 24 Somerset Road, Barry, Glamorgan, the eldest of the three children of Daniel James (Dan) Evans, ironmonger, and his wife, Catherine Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richard, shopkeeper. His industrious and godly parents established the Dan Evans department store in the booming coal-exporting port of Barry, and it was in this vibrant town of constantly shifting cultural borders on the periphery of &#145;Welsh&#146; Wales that Evans was brought up.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>The supreme irony of Evans's upbringing is that perhaps the greatest Welsh patriot of the twentieth century saw more of England than of Wales during his youth, with the family home directly in the shadow of the west country. Initially the politics of identity were of little consequence to the Liberal-supporting Evans family as the language of the home shifted from Welsh to English. Such a situation was not uncommon for the handful of Welsh-speaking families in Barry. This linguistic shift was reinforced by the thoroughly English education Evans received at the Barry county school, where he excelled at cricket. During these adolescent years this sickly child developed into a handsome young man but the key change was psychological. In 1929 he experienced a quasi-religious conversion and came to see Wales as a Christian nation in need of salvation from Englishness, modernism, and war.<br>
<br>Evans fervently believed that he had been called to save a nation (a familiar Welsh nonconformist trope) but his messianic fervour while at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he studied law between 1931 and 1934, was initially directed towards the town's pacifist and Christian societies, believing the recently formed Plaid Cymru to be too irrelevant to make any impact. However, after graduating with a second-class degree Evans did join Plaid Cymru, having reconsidered his earlier view that the party was in thrall to the prelapsarian ideas of its brilliant but utterly maverick president, Saunders Lewis. Though Evans and Lewis shared more in common than either would perhaps care to admit, Evans from the outset intended to change Plaid Cymru and make it a wholly pacifist and constitutional party, much to Lewis's extended and very public chagrin. These moves (and a somewhat exaggerated rediscovery of his command of the Welsh language) were adumbrated during a two-year period at St John's College, Oxford, between 1934 and 1936, where he obtained a further second-class degree in law. But it was upon his return to Wales and a period as an articled clerk with W. B. Francis, solicitors, in Cardiff that Evans's precocious vision of transforming Plaid Cymru began to mature.<br>
<br>Evans's pacifism crystallized into a clearly defined absolutist stance under the influence of the Peace Pledge Union. With war looming ever larger he resolved to save his dream of a peaceful Wales through selfless proselytizing. By 1939 he had abandoned the legal profession, deciding instead (much to his family's horror) that he would work on the family's farm in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire. This financial security and an unconditional discharge from military service allowed him to become an assiduous secretary of the Welsh Pacifists and a young tyro within the ranks of Plaid Cymru in extremely trying days. He also became a central figure in the more ecumenical New Wales Union, a body that proved vital in maintaining a sense of Welshness in the age of total war. Nevertheless, his stance proved extremely difficult for his family in Barry, since Evans combined two ideologies that were inimical to many. On 1 March 1941, at the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel, Crwys Road, Cardiff, Evans married Rhiannon Prys Thomas (<i>d</i>. 2006), daughter of Adolphus Daniel (Dan) Thomas, bank manager. They made their first home at Wernellyn, Llangadog, where they had seven children. Thus was set a pattern of political widowhood for Rhiannon, who bore her husband's frequent campaigning absences and self-absorption with remarkable forbearance.<br>
<br>The summer of 1943 saw Evans assume the <i>de facto</i> presidency of a rudderless Plaid Cymru with the nominal president, Abi Williams, indisposed because of a &#145;nervous condition&#146;. Despite the enormous difficulties and the suspicion that Plaid Cymru was a crypto-fascist party, Evans set about transforming the party's sect-like image. First he saved the party from disappearing completely and then started to make a deliberate pitch for the votes of Welsh-speaking, Liberal Wales by conjuring a gentle vision of Wales as a historic nation. Shedding the declamatory excesses of Saunders Lewis was vital, as was Evans's readiness to develop an eclectic political philosophy that combined elements of socialism, conservatism, pacifism, nationalism, and enviromentalism. Despite this &#145;big tent&#146; approach, his first foray into parliamentary politics was utterly inauspicious as a candidate in Merioneth during the general election of 1945.<h2>
<a name="PresidentofPlaidCymru"></a>President of Plaid Cymru</h2>Undaunted, and despite his natural reserve, Evans became party president in August 1945. He quickly became ever more convinced that nationalist failure should be ascribed to too little engagement with constitutional politics. At a local level this plunged Evans into vicious and landmark battles with the Labour Party on Carmarthenshire council, a body to which he was elected in 1949 and on which he sat until 1974, over the Welsh language. At a national level his repeated denunciation of Labour policy towards devolving power in Wales saw extended bouts of fisticuffs that, despite Plaid Cymru's ostensible insignificance, set the rhetorical tone for much of Welsh politics over the next five decades. He also exerted influence through such bodies as the BBC's Welsh advisory council and the court of the University of Wales. These moves were of a piece with his view that Plaid Cymru could not be exclusivist about how best to defend the interests of Wales. Crucially Evans also saw the need for a wider body of people to campaign for a Welsh parliament along the lines of the Scottish Covenant Association. In 1949 the Parliament for Wales campaign was launched&#151;the first mass campaign for devolution since the ill-starred venture of Young Wales half a century earlier.<br>
<br>Despite these ventures and ceaseless campaigning, electoral success proved elusive for Evans personally and his party in the general elections of 1950 and 1951. Two years later he moved to Talar Wen, Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, a beautiful house designed by his brother-in-law, Dewi Prys Thomas, which served as both family home and an assertion of the potentialities of Welsh architecture. Another significant consolation came in his being nominated president of the Welsh Congregationalists in 1954&#151;the radical denomination to which he was by now utterly devoted. But this accolade and a record number of parliamentary candidates for Plaid Cymru at the general election of 1955 failed to prevent further electoral ignominy. Evans became an increasingly divisive figure within his party and by the latter part of the decade two clear camps had developed. His acolytes saw him as an eirenical figure who deserved beatification for having devoted his life to the defence of Wales. Others, though, particularly supporters of Saunders Lewis, saw Evans as having turned a once radical party into a cult of insufferably nice pacifists wedded to a pointless constitutional cause.<br>
<br>These tensions over nationalist strategy exploded in the late 1950s over the question of how best to resist the construction by Liverpool corporation of the Tryweryn dam in Merioneth, the parliamentary constituency that Evans was still coveting. The unsuccessful fight to prevent the drowning of the village of Capel Celyn proved a pivotal moment in Welsh political history and nobody did more than Evans to expose what for many was a shocking injustice. However, the Tryweryn battle came close to destroying his political career as he vacillated between the polar opposites of parliamentary pressure and non-violent direct action. Having procrastinated for two years, he ultimately plumped for the former course in 1959, fearing that a long term of imprisonment would destroy the party. The financial future of his market gardening business was also a consideration, as was his fervent belief that he and Plaid Cymru could make a long-promised electoral breakthrough in Merioneth at the general election of that year; but a familiar fate awaited him and he came last.<br>
<br>This and other similarly disappointing results provoked five years of internecine strife within Plaid Cymru, as an epic battle between &#145;constitutionalists&#146; and &#145;actors&#146; raged. In 1961 Evans, in despair, had to be dissuaded from resigning, though nothing could prevent him from relinquishing the Merioneth parliamentary nomination in 1962. In middle age Evans had little of the iconic about him, as Welsh nationalist politics fractured shortly before the nadir of Plaid Cymru's electoral fortunes, the general election of 1964. By then some activists espoused violent and non-violent action; others argued for the party to adopt a more republican, left-wing stance and abandon the <i>via media</i> that Evans carefully trod. The latter tendency had by now brought him into lethal battle with Emrys Roberts, the party's mercurial but hubristic general secretary, who engineered what Evans (not without reason) perceived to be a coup. Roberts's sacking plunged the party into another bout of melancholy introspection between 1964 and the general election of March 1966. The upshot of this was that Evans's hopes of a parliamentary breakthrough in his newly adopted Carmarthen constituency looked as fanciful as ever.<br>
<br>Evans, predictably, lost to Labour's Lady Megan Lloyd George but the event, as one unwittingly prescient journalist put it, was a &#145;strange, listless affair&#146;, partly because of her absence through illness  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 24 March 1966). Within a few weeks of her victory Megan Lloyd George died, leaving Evans to fight a by-election in July 1966 in which the most optimistic nationalists hoped he would come second. To the surprise of everyone (not least himself) he won the seat. As election upsets go, it was one of the greatest shocks ever. True, Evans was the legatee of a truly gruesome period for the Wilson government, but he was also the beneficiary of a patriotic and to a lesser extent nationalist shift in Welsh political consciousness that he himself had helped to create in Carmarthen and elsewhere.<br>
<br>The effect of the Carmarthen victory transformed Evans's image. From now on he was seen as a national redeemer by many in his hyperventilating party, the man who had led Wales to freedom after centuries of servitude. Despite his loathing of Westminster, the new member for Carmarthen (and member for Wales, as he was colloquially known) skilfully used his parliamentary position to ask hundreds of questions about Wales&#151;a tactic that in turn prompted the Labour Party and in particular the Welsh secretary, George Thomas, to attack Evans with a fanatical zeal. Almost inevitably Evans lost the Carmarthen seat at the general election of 1970 but the effect of his by-election win on his party and Welsh politics would be profound. From now on Welsh and, from 1967, Scottish parliamentary nationalism became permanent fixtures in a new and plural British politics.<br>
<br>Evans spent the next four years trying to regain his Carmarthen seat and to propagate a love for Welsh history among a new generation of patriots. This he achieved through his extremely popular (and tendentious) history of Wales, <span class="italic">Land of My Fathers</span>, published in 1974. He regained the Carmarthen seat in the general election of October 1974. He returned to Westminster accompanied by Dafydd Elis-Thomas and Dafydd Wigley, two younger and tougher MPs who made the next five years less of a parliamentary penance for him, though by the end he was suffering from mental exhaustion. Together this triumvirate exacted a number of concessions, first from the Wilson and then from the Callaghan governments&#151;the most notable being the promise to hold a referendum on an assembly for Wales in 1979. The overwhelming rejection of an assembly by the people of Wales was a crushing blow for Evans, who interpreted the vote as a denial by the Welsh of their own existence. In the subsequent general election of 1979 he lost his seat. Utterly dispirited, he began to plan an act of patriotic martyrdom during 1980 in order to reinvigorate Welsh nationalism. This plan never came to fruition because the Conservative government handed him a cause on a plate when they broke their own manifesto commitment to create a separate Welsh-language television channel. In May 1980 Evans threatened to fast to the death unless the government capitulated. Amid scenes of mounting apprehension verging on blind panic when it became apparent that Evans was deadly serious, the government capitulated for fear Wales would become ungovernable. In 1982 the Welsh fourth channel, S4C, was launched&#151;a living monument to the suicidal threat of a somewhat inconsistent pacifist.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Evans relinquished the presidency of Plaid Cymru in 1981 after thirty-six years&#151;a record of unbroken leadership only bettered at the time by Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia. A last and misguided attempt to regain Carmarthen at the 1983 general election did not dim his passion for politics nor his prolific writing. In 1986 he and Rhiannon moved to Pencarreg, Carmarthenshire, though their latter years were difficult ones, with Rhiannon succumbing to Parkinson's disease almost immediately after the move. Eventually old age and osteoporosis ravaged his body too, though as he faded from public view his revered status grew in equal measure. He had already received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wales in 1973 and the Cymmrodorion medal in 1984, but the ultimate proof of his popularity among a section of the Welsh people came in 2004 when the Welsh public voted him the greatest living politician and fourth in a list of all-time Welsh heroes, after Aneurin Bevan, Owain Glyn D&#373;r, and the singer Tom Jones.<br>
<br>Evans died at his home, Talar Wen, Pencarreg, on 21 April 2005. His funeral service at Bethel Congregationalist Chapel, Aberystwyth, on 27 April was described as the nearest Wales has ever seen to a state funeral. His ashes were scattered a few weeks later on the hill fort of Garn Goch, Carmarthenshire, a part of Wales which provided emotional solace to this complex and sometimes contradictory man. Despite his unconventional personality and the fact that he did not bequeath a coherent political philosophy Evans's legacy was by the time of his death secure. Though all parties contributed to the process of political devolution for Wales, it is arguable that the national assembly for Wales would not exist were it not for Gwynfor Evans and his simple love for his nation at a time when the concept of Wales as a political nation did not exist.<br>
