<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hobhouse,  John Cam</span>, Baron Broughton  (1786&#150;1869), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Redland, Bristol, on 27 June 1786, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13402/', "Sir Benjamin Hobhouse, first baronet (1757&#150;1831)")</script>, politician and financier, and his first wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1791), daughter and heir of Samuel Cam of Chantry House, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire. He had two brothers and two sisters, one of whom died in infancy. His background was one of unenfranchised nonconformity and commercial wealth&#151;important factors in understanding the way in which his politics developed. His father was a noted Unitarian who campaigned for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>; his mother was also a dissenter. He went to Lewin's Mead, John Prior Estlin's Unitarian school at Bristol, then to Westminster School, and then to Trinity College, Cambridge. There he obtained the Hulsean prize in 1808 (for an essay entitled &#145;On the origin and intention of sacrifices&#146;), graduating BA in 1808 and MA in 1811. His mother died in 1791, and from his father's second marriage, to Amelia Parry, he acquired fourteen half-siblings.<h2>
<a name="TravelsinEuropeandrelationswithByron"></a>Travels in Europe and relations with Byron</h2>At Cambridge Hobhouse founded a whig club and became the close friend of Byron, with whom in 1809 he travelled across Portugal and Spain to Gibraltar. From Malta he and Byron were encouraged by English naval and diplomatic intelligence to travel into Albania, where they stayed with Ali Pasha from 19 to 23 October 1809; an English naval force meanwhile took over most of the Ionian Islands, a fact on which Ali congratulated them. They then went into Greece, where they were surprised to discover considerable anti-Turkish feeling among the inhabitants. They based themselves in Athens, visiting Marathon on 24 January, and then went via Smyrna to Constantinople, where they attended an audience with Sultan Mahmoud II on 10 July. On 31 October 1809 Hobhouse recorded in his diary, &#145;Byron is writing a long poem in the Spenserian stanza&#146;&#151;the first reference to <span class="italic">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span>  (BL, Add. MS 56527, fol. 65<i>r</i>). Prior to its publication Hobhouse had regarded Byron as his poetic equal. Lines 247&#150;62 in the first edition of <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> (1809) are by him. In their absence from England, Hobhouse's anthology <span class="italic">Imitations and Translations</span> was published, containing several poems by Byron. On returning Hobhouse published a comic poem, <span class="italic">The Wonders of a Week at Bath</span>, and his account of their eastern tour, <span class="italic">A Journey through Albania, and other Provinces of Turkey</span>, went through two printings. It is notable for its final section, about the aspirations and failures of Sultan Selim III. The book brought him a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1814.<br>
<br>From May 1813 to February 1814 Hobhouse made a long tour through wartime Europe, visiting Stralsund, Berlin, Vienna, Leipzig, Prague, Fiume, Weimar, and Amsterdam. The suffering he witnessed affected him. When in April 1814 the news broke of the abdication of the greatest of his heroes, Napoleon, he hurried to Paris, accompanied by Henry Grattan&#151;Byron had at first agreed to go, then changed his mind. On 3 May Hobhouse witnessed Louis XVIII entering the capital. Throughout this period he was a member of the Holland House whig circle, and considered, but rejected, the idea of standing as MP for Cambridge University. He heard of Byron's engagement to Annabella Milbanke via a third party. However, on 2 January 1815 he acted as best man at the wedding, having made an attempt&#151;probably with Byron's encouragement&#151;to dissuade the minister from performing the ceremony. Annabella learned about this, and it increased her dislike of him  (Lovelace MSS, Bodl. Oxf. 88. 25).<br>
<br>On Napoleon's escape from Elba, Hobhouse again went to Paris, where he met Benjamin Constant and witnessed Napoleon's attempt to become a constitutional ruler. He saw Bonaparte on several occasions. Waterloo&#151;the news of which reached him as he was trying to cross the Swiss border with Michael Bruce&#151;depressed him, and he was disgusted by the second reinstatement of Louis XVIII, &#145;this king of shreds and patches&#146;  (Berg collection, 4.101). In the following year he published an account of the &#145;hundred days&#146;, <span class="italic">The substance of some letters written by an Englishman resident in Paris during the last reign of the Emperor Napoleon</span>, in which he displayed his hatred of the Bourbon dynasty and his sympathy with Bonaparte&#151;despite the death of his brother Benjamin at Quatre Bras. The book&#151;the third edition of which was dedicated to Byron&#151;was reviewed ironically in <span class="italic">The Quarterly</span>. Its French translation was seized by the government, and both printer and translator were fined and imprisoned. He also wrote the prologue to Charles Maturin's play <span class="italic">Bertram</span> which opened at Drury Lane on 9 May 1816.<br>
<br>Hobhouse was loyal to Byron throughout the separation from Annabella, drawing up &#145;a full and scrupulously accurate account&#146; of the events. This was printed privately in 1870 in the wake of the Beecher Stowe controversy, and reprinted in <span class="italic">Recollections of a Long Life</span> (2.191&#150;366). He had seen Byron off at Dover on 25 April, and in the autumn of 1816, with Scrope Davies, visited the poet at the Villa Diodati near Geneva, arriving on the day Shelley left. He and Byron dined often with Madame De Sta&euml;l at Coppet, and made two alpine tours. Passing the Simplon in October, they visited Milan, where they were entertained by Ludovico di Br&ecirc;me, and met Vincenzo Monti, Stendhal, and Silvio Pellico, whose tragedy <span class="italic">Francesca da Rimini</span> Hobhouse translated, assisted at first by Byron. In Austrian-occupied Milan, Byron and Hobhouse found that their politics created an appreciative audience for them such as they had never experienced in England. They then visited Venice and Rome together. During late 1817 and early 1818 Hobhouse wrote some of the notes for canto iv of <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>; the poem was afterwards dedicated to him by Byron. The section on Italian literature in his book <span class="italic">Historical Illustrations to the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span> was written for him, in uneasy collaboration, by Ugo Foscolo. In 1823 he was outraged when Foscolo proposed to his stepsister Matilda.<h2>
<a name="Westminsterradical"></a>Westminster radical</h2>Hobhouse became a member of The Rota, a dinner club for the promotion of political reforms. In 1819 he contested the parliamentary seat of Westminster, which had become vacant after the suicide of Sir Samuel Romilly. He stood as a radical, supported by his father and by Sir Francis Burdett, but was defeated on 3 March by the whig George Lamb, Lord Melbourne's brother. Riots followed, and a breach opened between him and the Holland House whigs. About this time he wrote several political pamphlets, and his anonymous reply to a sarcastic speech of Canning's, <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Honourable George Canning, M. P.</span> (1818), attracted much attention. In 1819 he published an anonymous pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Trifling Mistake</span>, in which to the question &#145;What prevents the people from walking down to the House, and pulling out the members by the ears, locking up their doors, and flinging the key into the Thames?&#146; he answered that &#145;their true practical protectors &hellip; are to be found at the Horse Guards, and the Knightsbridge barracks&#146;  (pp. 49&#150;50). The House of Commons analysis of this passage, ignoring the answer, read the question as rhetorical, and found Hobhouse guilty of breach of privilege. Arrested on 14 December 1819, he remained in Newgate (in rooms next to the governor's) until the dissolution of parliament on 29 February 1820. On 5 February 1820 the court of king's bench had refused to interfere with the speaker's warrant, and Hobhouse could only respond with a protest in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Prior to his release he issued his address <span class="italic">To the Independent Electors of Westminster</span>.<br>
<br>While Hobhouse was in Newgate the Cato Street conspiracy occurred. Mrs Arbuthnot records in her diary Wellington's conviction that if it had succeeded, and the conspirators had offered Hobhouse the headship of their provisional government, he would have accepted. (In later years Hobhouse and Wellington were on excellent terms.) With Francis Place as his campaign manager Hobhouse succeeded in beating Lamb at Westminster at the general election of 1820 (25 March), and was returned to parliament as Burdett's colleague. Hobhouse's radicalism was qualified, and his statements of principle were vague. The exact nature of the franchise extension he envisaged was unclear. He never spoke out for universal suffrage, annual parliaments, or even the ballot. He was much clearer when attacking corrupt privilege. When in Newgate he rebuffed overtures made to him by William Cobbett, who thought of him as playing Sancho Panza to Sir Francis Burdett's Quixote.<br>
<br>Hobhouse was a supporter of Queen Caroline throughout her trial in 1820. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 9 May, and thenceforth was an active debater, supporting many liberal measures, including prison reform and libel law reform. He became the leading parliamentary spokesman for the state regulation of factory labour&#151;though by the 1840s his ardour against child labour had abated. His <span class="roman">Select Vestries Bill</span> of 1831 was an important step towards the establishment of fair and representative local government. He assisted in the foundation of London University.<h2>
<a name="Byronsexecutor"></a>Byron's executor</h2>Hobhouse had advised against the publication of <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> i and ii in 1819&#151;but he did correct the poem's proofs, which show, in their margins, his amusing altercations with Byron. Canto i, stanza 15, on Romilly's suicide, was suppressed on his initiative. The circulation of Byron's lampoon on his imprisonment, which he discovered on 16 April 1820, caused him severe disillusionment, which was stoically borne (the poem mocks him from an &eacute;litist whig viewpoint). He visited Byron for the last time at Pisa in September 1822, where he met Teresa Guiccioli. When they parted, on 22 September, Byron said, &#145;Hobhouse, you should never have come, or you should never go&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 3.8).<br>
<br>On 14 May 1824 Hobhouse received the news of Byron's death. In July, as one of the executors, he proved Byron's will, and superintended the funeral at Hucknall Torkard on 16 July. He went on censoring Byron to the end: had he desired the preservation of the memoirs, which Byron had given to Thomas Moore, to Hobhouse's fury, and which had been sold by Moore to John Murray, they would probably not have been destroyed on 17 May (fearful, perhaps, of their contents, Hobhouse does not seem to have read them). He was one of the most active members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95072', "London Greek Committee")</script> and after Byron's death he at first resolved to go to Greece himself in order to manage the Greek loan, although ultimately Henry Lytton Bulwer went in his place.<br>
<br>An admirer of <span class="italic">The Corsair</span> and <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>, iv, Hobhouse was out of sympathy with Byron's later works. He loathed <span class="italic">Cain</span>, and confessed in a diary entry for 1 June 1828 to having just read <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> <span class="smallcap">X</span>, <span class="smallcap">XI</span>, and <span class="smallcap">XII</span> for the first time, and to have discovered Byron to have been &#145;a great humourist&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 56552, fol. 105<i>r</i>). The possibility that <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> contains numerous references and jokes, only detectable to a close friend of Byron such as Hobhouse, is strong. Hobhouse refused to give Moore any help in the writing of his life of Byron. Having campaigned twice without success for the placement of Thorwaldsen's statue of Byron in Westminster Abbey, he saw it in 1844 put in the Wren Library at Trinity, where he admitted it went very well.<br>
<br>Hobhouse's need for more than casual female company seems to have been in abeyance throughout Byron's life, although in 1821 he did express a fondness for Susannah Burdett. In 1827 he fell in love with another of Burdett's daughters, Sophia, and proposed, but was refused. After an affair with the wife of a Wiltshire friend he married, on 28 July 1828, Lady Julia Tomlinson Hay (<i>d</i>. 1835), sister of the eighth marquess of Tweeddale, and niece to both Lord Lauderdale and &#145;King Tom&#146; Maitland. Not a robust person, she collapsed after the ceremony, but bore him three daughters, Julia, born in 1829, Charlotte in 1831, and Sophia in 1832, before dying of tuberculosis on 3 April 1835. The well-connected marriage gave Hobhouse entry to Almack's. His daughters survived a smallpox attack in 1840, but Julia died of cholera on 5 September 1849. Hobhouse's friend Peacock composed a moving elegy.<h2>
<a name="Officeinwhigadministrations"></a>Office in whig administrations</h2>The 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> brought forward by Grey's whig-led ministry corrected, in Hobhouse's view, the inequities of the old system, and his radicalism cooled. He thought the Chartists foolish dupes, and the Tolpuddle martyrs misguided. By 1836 Francis Place was describing him as &#145;live lumber&#146;  (Joyce, 283). He succeeded his father as second baronet on Sir Benjamin's death on 14 August 1831, and on 1 February 1832 was appointed secretary-at-war, being sworn of the privy council on 6 February. He tried to reform his chaotic department, and in the teeth of much opposition succeeded in abolishing several sinecures, and in restricting flogging in the army to certain defined misdemeanours&#151;although he was regarded by many as having failed in not having abolished it completely. His attempt at reducing the size of the army was not successful and, discouraged, he exchanged the post for that of chief secretary for Ireland on 28 March 1833. His tenure of this office, one more difficult even than the previous, was short-lived.<br>
<br>In April 1833 Hobhouse refused to vote with the government against the abolition of the house and window tax, on the grounds that he had urged its abolition while independent. He resigned both his office and&#151;to the incomprehension of many&#151;his seat for Westminster. However, though he offered himself for re-election, he found that his conservatism had lost him popularity. He was pelted on the hustings, and on 10 May was defeated by the radical Colonel George de Lacy Evans, though tory collusion was suspected.<br>
<br>On Melbourne's coming to power in July 1834 Hobhouse accepted the post of first commissioner of woods and forests. Melbourne's confidence in Hobhouse's loyalty may have been strengthened by his knowledge of the part he had played in discouraging Byron's elopement with Melbourne's late wife, Lady Caroline Lamb, on 29 July 1812. Melbourne and Hobhouse were often the sole guests at Buckingham Palace dinners. Hobhouse was returned for Nottingham at a by-election, also in July 1834. In 1841 he was accused of having won the by-election by bribery and intimidation (traditional approaches, without which campaigning in Nottingham would have been difficult) but was exonerated twice by select committee. He stood again for Nottingham in 1847, bribed no one, and lost to a Chartist&#151;the economic depression in the town was an important contributory factor in his defeat. However, he was returned as member for Harwich (one of the country's most corrupt constituencies) at a by-election in April 1848, without even making a personal canvass.<br>
<br>On the dismissal of Melbourne in November 1834, Hobhouse resigned with the rest of his colleagues. When Melbourne formed his second administration he was pressed to resume his old post at the War Office, but refused, and was appointed president of the Board of Control for India, with a seat in the cabinet, on 29 April 1835. He was present at Queen Victoria's first council at Kensington Palace on 20 June 1837. He was one of Palmerston's strongest supporters on the question of the Russian threat in central Asia, and was in part responsible for the English occupation of Afghanistan in 1838, the installation of the unpopular puppet ruler Shah Shuja, and the subsequent death-march from Kabul of January 1842&#151;in which his nephew John Byron Hobhouse was killed. The retreat, plus his acquiescence (at least) in what looked like Foreign Office editing of certain dispatches from India, represented a low-water mark in his reputation. He had resigned, with Melbourne, in September 1841.<h2>
<a name="Peerageandretirement"></a>Peerage and retirement</h2>On 10 July 1846 Hobhouse resumed the India post, with a seat in Lord John Russell's first cabinet&#151;of which, it was noted, he seemed one of the most conservative members. An unabashed imperialist, he promoted railway development in India, and approved of Dalhousie's annexation of the Punjab in 1849. Though he was delighted by the fall of Metternich, the 1848 continental revolutions worried him, and he anticipated a Chartist equivalent in England. He was created Baron Broughton of Broughton de Gyfford on 26 February 1851 and, on his final retirement from office, on the resignation of Russell on 21 February 1852, was made KCB (22 April 1852). From this time he withdrew from public life. He debated for the last time during the discussion of the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span> in July 1858. He spent his retirement at Tedworth House, Wiltshire, and at his London house, 42 Berkeley Square, revising his books and enjoying the society of his friends.<br>
<br>Hobhouse died after a short illness at 42 Berkeley Square on 3 June 1869, aged eighty-two, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He had been a vigorous debater, an excellent classical scholar, a competent versifier, an entertaining companion (though he was shy at unfamiliar social gatherings), and a staunch friend. On 10 April 1826, while speaking in the Commons, he invented the phrase &#145;His Majesty's Opposition&#146;, a phrase which gained instant currency. The barony became extinct on his death, but the baronetcy descended to his nephew Sir Charles Parry Hobhouse.<br>
<br>Hobhouse was short and of pugnacious appearance, having inherited a hooked nose from his mother. He was fond of shooting and fishing. A sceptic when young, he became a comfortable churchgoer when older. His writings are best approached as useful but only partial repositories of information. A collection of his diaries and correspondence is mostly in the British Library, although four volumes of his diary are in the Berg collection in New York. His privately printed <span class="italic">Some Account of a Long Life</span> (1865) was augmented by his daughter Lady Dorchester with edited entries from his diary and extracts from his other books, and published by Murray as <span class="italic">Recollections of a Long Life</span> between 1909 and 1911.<br>
