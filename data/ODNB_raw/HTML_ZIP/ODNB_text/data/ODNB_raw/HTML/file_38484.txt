<span class="headword">Jenkyns,  Henry</span>  (1795&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was born on 22 June 1795, eighth of the nine children of John Jenkyns (1753&#150;1824), vicar of Evercreech, Somerset, and Jane (<i>d</i>. 1825), daughter of James Banister, a Bristol merchant. The eldest child was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14744/', "Richard Jenkyns")</script>, master of Balliol College. Henry Jenkyns was educated at Eton College and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was a scholar (1813&#150;18). He took a double first in 1816, and graduated BA in 1817 (MA 1819, BD and DD 1841).<br>
<br>Oriel College, at that time academically dominant in Oxford, elected Jenkyns to a fellowship in 1818, which he held until 1835. He played his part in college affairs (he was treasurer in 1831) and politics&#151;leading a faction which opposed the appointment of John Henry Newman as dean in 1833&#151;but he was never a college tutor. Throughout the twenties he was private tutor to two sons of Charles Manners Sutton, speaker of the House of Commons, and he was frequently absent from Oxford with them at Eton or Westminster. His only substantial publication, an edition of the <span class="italic">Remains</span> of Thomas Cranmer, appeared in 1833. At that time Oxford's conservative churchmen were bent on inflating the reputations of the protestant martyr-bishops, and Cranmer's <span class="italic">Remains</span> was scholarly propaganda in that campaign. The four volumes are meticulously edited, but Jenkyns's no-popery sentiments are apparent in his long preface and footnotes.<br>
<br>In 1833 Jenkyns became the first professor of Greek and classical literature at the University of Durham. His brother-in-law Thomas Gaisford, dean of Christ Church and a former canon of Durham, was instrumental in his appointment. On 31 March 1834 Jenkyns married his second cousin Harriet (1807&#150;1876), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13403/', "Henry Hobhouse")</script>. They had four daughters and four sons. He was a leading member of the tiny senate which guided the University of Durham through its formative years, and was sub-warden for eight periods between 1840 and 1860. He was acting professor of divinity from 1835, but did not resign as professor of Greek and classical literature until 1840. The inaugural lecture he gave in 1834, published as <span class="italic">A Lecture on the Advantages of Classical Studies</span>, is remarkable for its prolixity and lack of substance. But his divinity teaching lectures, a systematic two-year course on church history, dogmatic theology, and forms of worship, were models of clarity, organization, and orthodoxy which attracted migrants from Oxford and Cambridge. According to Fowler, Jenkyns commanded the admiration and respect of his students. Although somewhat cold and aloof, he had a caustic sense of humour which occasionally enlivened the otherwise rigid decorum of his lecture room. The lectures were not published, but several sets of notes taken from them survive at Durham in the university library.<br>
<br>Jenkyns was collated to the third stall in Durham Cathedral in 1839, the last canon of Durham to be installed before the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act</span> of 1840 reduced the value of such dignities, and he was formally appointed professor of divinity in 1840. It was intended that the canonry should eventually be annexed to and support the professorship, but the two were not formally linked until later. In 1864 he resigned his professorship and retired to Botley Hill, Bishop's Waltham, near Southampton. He was nevertheless able to enjoy the unreformed emoluments of his golden stall (nearly &pound;4000 per annum) until his death. He voluntarily surrendered &pound;1000 per annum to cover the cost of his replacement as professor but, controversially, he continued to enjoy in retirement a net income which was three times as much as his successor would ever earn. He died at Botley Hill on 2 April 1878, and was buried next to his wife in the graveyard of Curdridge church.<br>
