<span class="headword">Pott,  Joseph Holden</span>  (1758&#150;1847), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 27 October 1758 in Smithfield, London, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22604/', "Percivall Pott (1714&#150;1788)")</script>, an eminent surgeon, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Robert Crittenden. He was educated at Eton College from 1767, becoming a scholar in 1776. About that year he entered St John's College, Cambridge, where he secured Sir William Browne's medal, graduated with first-class classical honours in 1780, and proceeded MA in 1783. By 1786 he had published <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1779), <span class="italic">Elegies, with Selmane, a Tragedy</span> (1782), <span class="italic">Essay on Landscape Painting</span> (1782), and <span class="italic">The Tour of Valentine</span> (1786). He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Peterborough in 1781 and priest by the bishop of Lincoln in 1782. He was appointed rector of Beesby in the Marsh, Lincolnshire, in 1783, and of Bratoft in 1784, and chaplain to Lord Chancellor Thurlow in 1784. Bishop Thurlow of Lincoln collated him to the prebendal stall of Welton Brinkhall in Lincoln Cathedral in 1785. He resigned Bratoft for St Olave Jewry and St Martin Pomeroy, Ironmonger Lane, in London in 1787. In 1789 Bishop Porteus of London appointed him archdeacon of St Albans, and he resigned Beesby in 1790. In 1797 Porteus appointed him rector of Little Burstead in Essex, and he resigned his City parishes. In 1806 he accepted the vicarage of Northall in Middlesex, and resigned Little Burstead. In 1812 Bishop Randolph appointed him vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields. In 1813 he exchanged the archdeaconry of St Albans for that of London, and in 1814 resigned his prebendal stall at Lincoln. In 1822 Bishop Howley appointed him a prebendary of St Paul's, and he resigned the vicarage of Northall; in 1824 he accepted the vicarage of Kensington, and resigned St Martin-in-the-Fields. In 1826 Archbishop Manners-Sutton appointed him a prebendary and chancellor of Exeter Cathedral. He resigned as vicar of Kensington and archdeacon of London in 1842.<br>
<br>Pott was regarded as an exceptionally efficient administrator and a good preacher. He was a member of the Hackney Phalanx, and was associated with many of their reforming projects. As archdeacon of St Albans he was much concerned with education and the role of the clergy. Contemporaries regarded him as an exemplary archdeacon. As a governor of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge he was associated with Joshua Watson, William Van Mildert, and Christopher Wordsworth in establishing district committees of clergy and laity in each diocese to broaden the membership of the society, and to increase its income and influence. He was subsequently treasurer of the society and attempted to organize parliamentary support for missionary work in India, but was opposed by Bishop Randolph of London. He was one of the initiators of the Incorporated Church Building Society, launched in 1818 to assist in providing grants for building churches in newly developing urban areas, and he was appointed a member of the commission established by Lord Liverpool's government to administer the &pound;1 million grant to build new churches and to establish new parishes. Pott was a key member of the commission, serving on its most important committees. His relations with Bishop Blomfield from 1828 were frosty. He was regarded as the last survivor of the Hackney Phalanx. He was an active residentiary at Exeter, where he was involved in the dispute between Bishop Phillpotts and the dean and chapter over the interpretation of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> ornaments rubric during the Exeter &#145;Surplice riots&#146; in 1842.<br>
<br>Pott had a reputation as a theologian, publishing <span class="italic">Remarks on Two Particulars in a Refutation of Calvinism</span> in 1811, in response to Sir George Pretyman-Tomline's <span class="italic">Refutation of Calvinism</span>, and <span class="italic">The Testimony of St Paul Concerning Justification</span> in 1846, in addition to at least seven collections of sermons. He died, unmarried, aged eighty-eight, in his house in Woburn Place, Holborn, on 16 February 1847, and was buried in St Mary Aldermary, with his parents. He left estate valued at &pound;20,000.<br>
