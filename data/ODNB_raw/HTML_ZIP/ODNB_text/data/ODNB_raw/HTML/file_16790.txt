<span class="headword">Litton,  Marie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Maria Lowe]</span>  (1847&#150;1884), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born of unknown parentage in Derbyshire. She made her first appearance on the stage in London, at the Princess's Theatre on 23 March 1868, as Effie Deans in a revised version by Boucicault of <span class="italic">The Trial of Effie Deans</span>, his adaptation from Scott's <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span>. It was a performance of much promise. On the opening of the Gaiety on 21 December 1868 she played Mrs Cureton in <span class="italic">On the Cards</span>, an adaptation by Alfred Thompson from <span class="italic">L'Escamoteur</span>. In December of the next year she understudied Lilian Adelaide Neilson in H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">Uncle Dick's Darling</span>, but was prevented by the recent birth of her baby from taking the leading role when Miss Neilson was incapacitated by a falling piece of scenery. (Her husband was William Wybrow Robertson.) She was later connected with the Brighton theatre.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1871 Marie Litton undertook the management of the Court Theatre in Sloane Square, London (designs by Walter Emden), and opened with <span class="italic">Randall's Thumb</span> by W. S. Gilbert. She retained the theatre until 13 March 1874 and put on very many plays; comments were made on the grace of manner of her acting. She took secondary roles in her own theatre and at the same time appeared at the Haymarket. By 24 April 1875 she was playing the original Caroline Effingham in Gilbert's <span class="italic">Tom Cobb</span> at the St James's, and from there went on to the Prince of Wales's. She then took the Royal Aquarium Theatre (renamed the Imperial) and, with a strong company, which included Samuel Phelps nearing the end of his career, began a series of revivals of &#145;old comedy&#146;, taking many leading roles, including Lady Teazle and Lydia Languish, herself. Her Miss Hardcastle played for 137 nights at the Imperial and her Rosalind for 100 nights at the same house before transferring to Drury Lane. There she acted with a distinguished cast which included Hermann Vezin, William Farren, and Sylvia Hodson; her Rosalind was much admired. In 1879 she managed the matin&eacute;es at the Gaiety and was seen to even greater advantage as Peggy in a modification of Garrick's <span class="italic">The Country Girl</span>. She then went north to manage the new Theatre Royal in Glasgow, but by August 1881 was back at Drury Lane as Eve de Malvoisie in <span class="italic">Youth</span> by Paul Meritt and Augustus Harris. After this she played at the Globe and was the original Vere Herbert in Henry Hamilton's adaptation of Ouida's novel <span class="italic">Moths</span>, in which role she gave an excellent interpretation.<br>
<br>However, signs of serious illness intervened and Marie Litton was compelled to quit the stage. She retired with her husband and two children to Ascot, where her health continued to fail. She died after a long illness at her town house, 6 Alfred Place, Thurloe Square, South Kensington, on 1 April 1884.<br>
