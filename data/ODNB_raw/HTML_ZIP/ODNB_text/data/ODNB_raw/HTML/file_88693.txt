<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Millichip, Sir  Frederick Albert <span class="st"> [Bert]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2002), <span class="occ">football administrator</span>, was born on 5 August 1914 at 115 High Street, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, the son of Hugh Bowater Millichip, a master saddler (later a leather goods manufacturer and sports outfitter) and his wife, Lily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pester. He went to Solihull School where he developed an interest in sport, notably cricket and association football. As a young man he played both while working in his father's business. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 he joined the South Staffordshire regiment as a private, but was later commissioned in the Royal Artillery, serving in north Africa and Italy. He was demobilized in 1945 with the rank of captain. Meanwhile, on 24 February 1943 he had married Patricia Mary Long, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Arthur Long, a company director. The marriage was short-lived, and he later omitted it from his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry.<br>
<br>After the war Millichip trained to be a solicitor, qualifying in 1950. On 27 December the same year he married (Joan) Barbara Brown, a 24-year-old nursing sister, and daughter of Harold Henry Brown, farmer. They had a son and a daughter. Meanwhile Millichip worked for, and eventually became a senior partner in, his uncle's firm of Sharpe and Millichip, of West Bromwich. His uncle was also the solicitor of West Bromwich Albion Football Club and when he retired, Bert Millichip, as he was always known, took his place. He joined the board of directors in 1964, becoming chairman in 1976. By this time he had become more deeply involved in the administration of the game and had been elected a member of the council of the Football Association (FA) in 1970. By 1978 he was chairman of its disciplinary committee and in 1981 he was elected chairman of the FA itself. He was to preside over fifteen of the most turbulent years in its history.<br>
<br>In the twenty years after 1970 English football became notorious for the unruly behaviour of the crowds who paid to watch. The <i>annus horribilis</i> was probably 1985, when there was both a riot at an FA cup replay between Luton Town and Millwall and the disaster at the Heysel stadium in Brussels before the European cup final, when the supporters of Liverpool charged those of Juventus, leading to the collapse of a wall and the crushing to death of thirty-nine Italian fans. Both incidents were widely seen on television. At the time of the Heysel stadium incident Millichip was in Mexico where the England team were playing in preparation for the 1986 world cup. He acted decisively, flying back and forth over the Atlantic and announcing the withdrawal of English clubs from European competitions. The Confederation of European Football Associations later banned English clubs for five years and Liverpool for six.<br>
<br>The Thatcher government's preferred solution to hooliganism at football matches in the United Kingdom was a membership and identity card scheme. This was an idea which few inside the sport supported, although, like Millichip, most were at a loss as to what could be done. But after the disaster at Hillsborough, Sheffield, before the FA cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in April 1989, when eighty-nine people were crushed to death, the government's committee of inquiry, chaired by Lord Taylor, came out against identity cards, recommending instead the removal of fences from around the pitch and the replacement of the traditional standing terraces by seats on all major sports grounds.<br>
<br>If what to do about hooliganism was never far away from Millichip's thoughts, the second big issue that demanded his attention was who should run football. The FA was in theory responsible for all football, both the recreational and the professional spectacle. But since 1888 the Football League had largely been left to organize the professional side of the game, which it had done on a basis of mutuality. In practice this meant some transfer of wealth from the bigger clubs to the smaller ones, so exercising some control over market forces. These ideas were under some strain during the 1980s, with some of the bigger clubs threatening to break away from the traditional structures in order to make their own deals with television. These matters were made more urgent by the Taylor report. Replacing standing terraces with seats was not only expensive in itself but reduced the capacity of the stadiums. Some of the cost could be met by increasing the price of admission, but there was a limit to what spectators would be prepared to pay. Satellite television proved the saviour. In 1988 British Satellite Broadcasting had identified sport in general and football in particular as a way of building up a mass pay-per-view audience. Two years later the company merged with Rupert Murdoch's Sky to form BSkyB, which was prepared to pay &pound;304 million over five years for exclusive coverage of the top matches.<br>
<br>The clubs in the old first division saw this as an opportunity to break away from the Football League, with its old-fashioned ideas of caring and sharing. Millichip and the FA, whose relations with the league had not always been harmonious, connived with the top clubs to produce a blueprint for football which involved setting up a premier league and leaving the rest of the clubs in the Football League to fend for themselves. It is not clear how far Millichip was an initiator of these changes or whether he merely acquiesced in them. He rarely seems to have talked the language of reform and claimed to have had reservations about the premier league. He pointed out, though after the event, that not only had the footballing rich become richer as a result but the footballing poor had become richer too. Nevertheless many football supporters questioned whether it was the role of the FA to throw in its lot with the richest clubs, who were increasingly concerned with pursuing their own commercial interests.<br>
<br>Millichip played an important part in the successful organization and presentation of the FA's bid in 1993 to host the European football championship of 1996. Unfortunately he was more noted for a mysterious but damaging episode associated with it. The success of the 1996 tournament led to the FA's bidding for the 2006 world cup. When the FA's intention was made public, the German football association claimed that the English were in breach of an agreement which Millichip had verbally made with German football officials, that if they supported the English bid for the 1996 European championships, the FA would support a German bid for the 2006 world cup. There was apparently nothing in writing, and Millichip said he could not remember having made such an agreement, but the words &#145;perfidious&#146; and &#145;Albion&#146; were brought together in many British and European newspapers.<br>
<br>Millichip once said that he was an amateur at heart. What he probably meant was that he looked back to an earlier football world where football was less of a business, when players behaved with more self-control both on and off the field, and when crowd trouble was as rare as sunshine in November. He opposed, though he could not prevent, the sponsorship of the FA cup. Some of his views seemed to reflect an anxiety about the modern world. In 1980 he wrote to the then chairman of the FA, Sir Harold Thompson, about the &#145;terminal moral decay&#146; which he felt was evident in both football and wider society  (Millichip to Thompson, 26 Sept 1980, Thompson papers). He occasionally spoke out in favour of the return of corporal punishment. He regretted that more of his time as FA chairman was spent defending football rather than promoting it. But he served in difficult times, and faced problems far more complex than any faced by his predecessors.<br>
<br>Millichip was a member of the UEFA executive committee from 1988 to 1996, having been a member of its organizing committee for the European championship since 1981. He was chairman of its committee for five-a-side football from 1988 to 1992 and of its juridical committee from 1992 to 1993. He was knighted for his services to football in 1991 and made an honorary DLitt by Loughborough University in 1995. David Davies, a senior football administrator, described him as &#145;unfailingly kind, approachable and such a polite man, a true gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 19 Dec 2002). He died suddenly on 18 December 2002, at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, following a heart attack which struck while he was attending an annual dinner at Edgbaston golf club. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their two children.<br>
