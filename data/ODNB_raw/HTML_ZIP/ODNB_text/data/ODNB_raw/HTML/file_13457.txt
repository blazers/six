<span class="headword">Hofland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wreaks]</span>,  Barbara</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1844), <span class="occ">children's writer and novelist</span>, was probably born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the daughter of Robert Wreaks (<i>d</i>. 1773), ironmonger. She was baptized in Sheffield on 16 February 1770. After her father's death and her mother's remarriage, Barbara was brought up by a maiden aunt. From July 1794 she began contributing poems to the Sheffield newspaper <span class="italic">The Iris</span>, edited by Robert Montgomery. She married a local businessman, Thomas Bradshawe Hoole (1766&#150;1799), in June 1796, but he died three years later and his business collapsed, leaving her virtually penniless and with a baby son, Frederic, to raise. She continued writing verse and her <span class="italic">Poems</span> of 1805 sold over 2000 copies. She also began writing children's stories, <span class="italic">The History of an Officer's Widow</span> being published in 1809, the year she opened a girls' school in Harrogate. Running the school proved difficult, but consolation was at hand, and on 28 January 1810 Barbara married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13458/', "Thomas Christopher Hofland (1777&#150;1843)")</script>, a talented landscape artist.<br>
<br>The couple moved to London in 1811 and Hofland exhibited at the Royal Academy. Barbara Hofland's literary career developed. Her tale <span class="italic">The Daughter-in-Law</span> (1812) so impressed Queen Charlotte that she gave permission for the author to dedicate a later book to her. In 1812 Barbara Hofland also published an adult novel, <span class="italic">Says she to her Neighbour what?</span>, as well as her most popular children's book, <span class="italic">The Son of a Genius</span>, the story of an impulsive artist whose erratic behaviour brings poverty to his wife and son, a tale which may contain autobiographical elements. <span class="italic">The Son of a Genius</span> was frequently reprinted in England, reaching a fourteenth edition by 1841, and was reprinted at least nine times in America, as well as being translated into French and other European languages. Barbara Hofland made friends with many celebrities, including the architect John Soane and the writers Maria Edgeworth and Mary Russell Mitford.<br>
<br>But her literary efforts did not make Barbara Hofland rich. She was paid only &pound;10 for <span class="italic">The Son of a Genius</span>, and though her husband exhibited six pictures at the Royal Academy in 1815, his earnings were erratic, often affected by lack of self-discipline and poor health. In 1816, for example, he produced an illegitimate son, Thomas Richard Hofland, whom his wife took in and treated as her own. Financial difficulties continued. In 1819 the Hoflands finished a book commissioned by the marquess of Blandford about his estate at Whiteknights, Reading, but were paid nothing for their labours. In 1822 an exhibition of Hofland's paintings failed. But children's books, novels, textbooks, and verse continued to flow from Barbara Hofland's pen. By the 1830s, however, she found writing painful because of a shoulder injury, and in 1833 she suffered a severe blow with the death of her son Frederic, a much-loved parish priest. After her husband's death in 1843, Barbara Hofland finished her last children's book, <span class="italic">Emily's Reward, or, The Holiday Trip to Paris</span> in August 1844. She died of erysipelas at her home, The Hollies, Richmond-on-Thames, on 4 November 1844, and was buried in the parish churchyard, Richmond-on-Thames, Surrey. Barbara Hofland was a prolific author whose bibliography lists sixty-six titles, not including contributions to periodicals, such as the &#145;Letters to kinfolk&#146;, articles of literary gossip printed in regional papers. Her most popular books, however, were her didactic moral tales for children, often depicting the struggles of a Christian family in adverse circumstances. Though characteristic of the period, these often contain realistic details about hardship, work, and ordinary family life, seen particularly in such books as <span class="italic">Ellen, the Teacher</span> (1814) and <span class="italic">Elizabeth and her Three Beggar Boys</span> (1833), which some scholars think may have influenced Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span> and Dickens's <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>. Although Barbara Hofland's adult novels were not successful, some of her adventure stories, such as <span class="italic">The Young Crusoe</span> (1829), achieved popularity. Her portraits of brave and resourceful heroines in such tales as <span class="italic">Decision</span> (1824) are also noteworthy. Her books were frequently reprinted in Britain and America throughout the nineteenth century and often translated. She seems to have been a loving and attractive person&#151;an engraving of 1818 reveals a friendly, humorous face with dark eyes and amused mouth&#151;and it is the strength and resource behind her arduous and ultimately heroic life that her books best convey.<br>
