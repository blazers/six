<span class="headword">Kincaid, Sir  John</span>  (1787&#150;1862), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Dalheath House, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire, in January 1787, the second son of John Kincaid of Dalheath and his wife, daughter of John Gaff. Kincaid's father, a &#145;small lowland Scotch laird &hellip; was unfortunately cut off in early life&#146;, leaving a &#145;young family&#146;  (Kincaid, <span class="italic">Random Shots</span>, 3). Having been educated at Polmont School, Polmont, Stirlingshire, John Kincaid grew into &#145;a lean lank fellow&#146; over 6 feet tall  (Kincaid, <span class="italic">Adventures</span>, 9) and served as a lieutenant in the North York militia. On 27 April 1809, with a draft of volunteers from this militia, he joined the 95th foot (which was to be restyled the Rifle brigade on 16 February 1816) at Hythe, Kent, as a second lieutenant, in time to sail for Walcheren &#145;where we remained about three weeks, playing at soldiers, smoking <i>mynheer's</i> long clay pipes, and drinking his <i>vrow's</i> butter-milk, for which I paid liberally with my precious blood to their infernal musquittos [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (ibid., 2).<br>
<br>Kincaid was weakened by &#145;a horrible ague&#146;, but after convalescing in Scotland he returned to Hythe in spring 1810 and went with the 95th's 1st battalion to reinforce Wellington in Spain following the battle of Busaco as his allied troops retreated towards the lines of Torres Vedras, the Anglo-Portuguese fortification defending Lisbon. With the 95th &#145;Johnny&#146; Kincaid pursued the French when they withdrew from outside the lines in March 1811; he took part in actions at Santarem, Pombal, Redinha, Casal Nova, Foz d'Arouce (where he was concussed and believed dead), Sabugal, Fuentes d'O&ntilde;noro, Fuente Guinaldo, and Aldea de Ponte. After promotion to first lieutenant on 23 May 1811 Kincaid commanded the battalion's highland company and led a detachment of the storming party at the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812; at Badajoz he was adjutant of four companies, &#145;who were to line the crest of the glacis, and to fire at the ramparts and the top of the left breach&#146;  (Kincaid, <span class="italic">Adventures</span>, 130). He fought at Salamanca and entered Madrid with Wellington in August.<br>
<br>During the withdrawal to winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo after three months, Kincaid acted as brigade major to the 1st brigade of the light division, taking part in the skirmish at Sanmunoz. When Wellington launched another offensive into Spain in 1813, Kincaid was in action at Munos and San Milan, Vitoria, in the Pyrenees, on the Nivelle and Nive rivers, near Bayonne in December 1813, and at the final battle of Toulouse (April 1814). On 21 July 1814 he became adjutant of the 1st battalion, and was recalled from a shooting leave in Scotland to fight at Quatre Bras and Waterloo, where his horse was killed under him. Of Waterloo he wrote: &#145;The smoke hung so thick about us that, although not more than eighty yards asunder, we could only distinguish each other by the flashes of the pieces &hellip; [we were] so many hours enveloped in darkness&#146;  (Kincaid, <span class="italic">Adventures</span>, 254, 256). Having been posted with the 95th immediately east of the Brussels&#150;Charleroi Road, Kincaid became heavily involved in fighting for the knoll and sand-pit opposite La Haye-Sainte.<br>
<br>Kincaid, who was promoted captain in the rifle brigade on 25 November 1826, sold out and retired in June 1831. He was appointed exon of the yeomen of the guard on 25 October 1844, and was knighted on 30 June 1852 on becoming senior exon. In 1847 he was appointed inspector of prisons for Scotland and in 1850 also inspector of factories for Scotland and the north of England. He resigned both appointments through ill health shortly before his death.<br>
<br>In 1830 Kincaid published <span class="italic">Adventures in the Rifle Brigade</span>, an account of his military life, 1809&#150;15, dedicated to Major-General Sir Andrew Barnard KCB. The book has been reprinted frequently, and in the introduction to the 1929 edition Sir John Fortescue praised Kincaid's descriptions of individuals and &#145;the daily routine of the campaign, which are of real historical value&#146;. He concluded: &#145;so long as the Rifle Brigade lasts his <span class="italic">Adventures</span> will be a text-book for all good riflemen&#146;  (Kincaid, <span class="italic">Adventures</span>, v). Fortescue was, however, led to condemn &#145;a certain flippancy and Jacosity in his narrative&#146; of the war  (ibid.): &#145;we found their whole army drawn out on the plain, near Redhina, and instantly quarreled with them on a large scale&#146;; the French General Loison's captured Portuguese aide-de-camp &#145;looked very like a man who would be hanged&#146;, his &#145;handsome&#146; Spanish wife &#145;very like a woman who would get married again&#146;  (ibid., 35, 46). But descriptions of camp life were vivid: lying at night with only a coat or blanket as inadequate protection against the dew and &#145;a green sod or a smooth stone for a pillow&#146;  (ibid., 34). And Kincaid graphically illustrated other privations, such as lack of money through arrears of pay, hunger on the march, and the need to cut the boots off his swollen feet after six days in action. Kincaid's second book, <span class="italic">Random Shots of a Rifleman</span> (1835), essentially a collection of anecdotes, dedicated to Major-General Lord Fitzroy Somerset KCB, was in Fortescue's estimation &#145;of not quite equal merit&#146;  (ibid., v).<br>
<br>Kincaid was awarded the military general service medal (or Peninsular silver medal) with nine clasps and the Waterloo medal. Curiously, entries in editions of the <span class="italic">Army List</span>, 1810&#150;17, name him &#145;Kincaird&#146;. Kincaid died of liver disease on 22 April 1862 at 7 Cambridge Terrace, Hastings, Sussex, survived by his wife, Louisa.<br>
