<span class="headword">Griffith,  George</span>  (1811/12&#150;1883), <span class="occ">corn dealer and reformer of endowed schools</span>, was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, where his father lived in Edgbaston Street. Details of his education are obscure, but as a youth he was an avid reader and in early adulthood he attended and later taught at the Birmingham Mechanics' Institute. His lifelong radicalism was influenced by the Birmingham Political Union during the parliamentary reform crisis of 1830&#150;32. In 1830 he became a clerk in the office of a corn merchant, and on 14 July 1833 he married Mary Rees Smith (1812/13&#150;1894) of Bewdley, Worcestershire, with whom he had at least four sons and one daughter; two sons died in infancy. In 1837 he set up in business on his own account as a corn dealer in Bewdley, and for the next four decades he regularly attended the corn markets of the west midlands and beyond.<br>
<br>Griffith's travels alerted him to the decay of endowed schools in provincial towns and when, in 1847, he moved his business to Kidderminster, Worcestershire, he became involved in the controversy over the new scheme approved by the court of chancery for reorganizing the charitable endowments of Kidderminster grammar school. Townspeople thought the scheme disadvantaged them, and Griffith took a prominent part in the agitation, circulating in 1848 a pamphlet showing how the new scheme deviated from the local charitable purposes for which the school had been founded. In 1850 he was elected to the town council as a school reformer and in the same year published an attack on Tractarianism, of which the vicar of Kidderminster and chairman of the school trustees, Thomas Legh Claughton, was an adherent. After the failure of a petition to the school's visitor, the bishop of Worcester (Henry Pepys), Griffith became the leading instigator of a chancery suit which sought to overturn the objectionable features of the new scheme, especially the permission which it gave to the headmaster to admit an unlimited number of boarders, the levying of fees for the teaching of subjects other than the classics, and the headmaster's policy of excluding sons of non-Anglicans. Apart from the latter issue, which related to the headmaster and not the new scheme, all the grounds for the suit were rejected by Sir George Turner, in an important judgment delivered on 8 November 1851. Following this defeat Griffith &#145;made a solemn vow, that I would never, during my life, cease to expose endowed school perversions, wherever I found them existing&#146;  (Griffith, <span class="italic">Going to Markets</span>, 2.437).<br>
<br>Rather than incur further legal expenses, Griffith sought to arouse public opinion in support of the restoration of endowed schools to their original purposes, and delivered lectures in Worcester, Bromsgrove, Bewdley, Stourbridge, Manchester, and London. He backed up his public speaking with a major work of antiquarian compilation and investigation, <span class="italic">The Free Schools of Worcestershire and their Fulfilment</span> (1852), dedicated to Robert Whiston, the contemporary reformer of Rochester Cathedral school. This was prefaced by a proposal for an act of parliament to deprive the court of chancery of its supervisory role, to make school trustees elective, to create county boards to oversee the trustees, to adapt endowed schools to the needs of their neighbourhoods, and to confine their benefits to those classes for whom they had been intended. These prescriptions anticipated many of the ideas for reforming endowed schools which gained currency a decade later.<br>
<br>Effective at stirring up local interests, Griffith had less success in transferring his cause to the national stage, not least because of the competing demands of running a business. He briefly engaged the support of MPs such as Francis Mowatt and William Ewart, but proposals in 1853 to found a Birmingham-based league, on the model of the Anti-Corn Law League, to bring in legislation came to nothing. He continued to promote the cause by lecturing, addressing letters to local newspapers, a heavy-handed didactic novel, <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of George Wilson, a Foundation Scholar</span> (1854), and further volumes on the free schools of Staffordshire (1860) and Birmingham (1861). In 1860 he challenged the revisionist contention of the headmaster of Shrewsbury School and eminent Latin scholar Benjamin Hall Kennedy that <i>libera schola</i> (free school) meant free from ecclesiastical jurisdiction rather than, as Griffith maintained, free from payment.<br>
<br>The common theme of Griffith's publications was to expose, as he put it, the conspiracy on the part of the upper classes to deprive the middle and working classes of their birthright. He sought to show that the schools had been chiefly founded for the benefit of the latter, resident in the locality of the schools, but as a result of the admission of outsiders as boarders, the curricular emphasis on the classics, and the defective supervision of the charities by unelected trustees, the benefits of the charities had fallen into the hands of sons of the &#145;opulent classes&#146;. He calculated that if the funds of endowed schools were properly applied, they would amount to &pound;6 a year for every child in the United Kingdom between the ages of eight and fourteen, therefore making the fees levied on middle-class parents&#151;by whom he meant tradesmen, clerks, and small farmers&#151;unnecessary. Having moved to Wolverhampton in 1861, he involved himself in local controversies there, and in Bridgnorth, Tamworth, and Etwall (Repton School), over the alleged misapplication of local educational endowments, and also travelled to Ireland in 1869 to examine the state of endowed schools. He elaborated his ideas in a paper to the Social Science Association congress in York in 1864, but by then a more influential movement, concerned with raising standards in secondary schools, had been set in train to reform educational endowments, and Griffith was effectively displaced. His attempts to gain an appointment as an assistant commissioner on the schools' inquiry commission, chaired by Lord Taunton, were unsuccessful, the positions mainly going to university men. He subsequently attacked the schemes of the endowed schools commissioners, which ended gratuitous education and vested school government in co-optive trustees.<br>
<br>Griffith's failures reinforced his sense of being an outsider, as a small businessman, in his relations with the professional classes and the aristocracy, and fuelled his radical hostility to the &#145;upper ten thousand&#146; and the extravagant national expenditure which he believed underpinned them. A streak of anti-clericalism also coloured his outlook, though he was a member of the Church of England. He attributed his reverses to collusion among the well connected, and concluded that no improvement in government could be achieved until a different class of men entered parliament. He put himself forward as a parliamentary candidate for Kidderminster in 1868, but withdrew before polling took place. Through his involvement in the corn trade he identified himself with the interests of small tenant farmers, and called for the repeal of the malt tax and the game laws. His memoirs, <span class="italic">Going to Markets and Grammar Schools</span> (2 vols., 1870), recording his experiences as a corn dealer during the years of transition from protection to free trade, are frustratingly sparse in their account of his family life. But they reproduce the details of his campaigns, municipal activities, and minor literary productions in inordinate detail. Their &#145;quiet egoism&#146; amused one reviewer, who nevertheless acknowledged Griffith's standing as &#145;a representative of the civic Hampden in the unceasing pursuit of abuses&#146; (<span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, 7 Feb 1871; quoted in Griffith, <span class="italic">Reminiscences and Records</span>, 95). The volumes also revealed the ambiguities in his radicalism, for they reproduced correspondence in which it emerged that in 1846 he had sought the admission of one of his sons, as a boarder, to Kidderminster grammar school, in furtherance of his ambition to educate his sons for the church; the rejection of his application by the headmaster, on the ground that he was a tradesman in the town, suggested that a personal motive helped to spark his original campaign.<br>
<br>A prolific versifier, Griffith took pride in his literary activities carried out in moments of leisure. Local events such as the opening of the two Worcester corn exchanges and the unveiling of the statue to the prince consort in Wolverhampton were subjects of his verse. The rebuilt castle of Quatford inspired a volume of couplets, <span class="italic">The English Village</span> (1847), dedicated to John Smalman, the architect, while the battle of Worcester suggested a poetic drama on Charles II, of which in 1869 he sent a copy of the third edition to Queen Victoria, with a request (not granted) that he receive in return a signed copy of her highland journal.<br>
<br>Settling at Severn Cottage, Bewdley, in 1870, Griffith was a member of the corporation and defended charitable doles to the poor. He stood for the Bewdley parliamentary seat at the general election of 1874 as an independent Liberal against an official Liberal and a Conservative and, &#145;ignoring all the persuasions of his best friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kidderminster Shuttle</span>, 10 Feb 1883), persisted in going to the polls, where he received only one vote. He produced a further volume of memoirs and miscellaneous writings (1880), but latterly was in straitened circumstances and &#145;his mind, at one time very vigorous, became clouded&#146;  (<span class="italic">Worcester Daily Times</span>, 9 Feb 1883). He died at the County Lunatic Asylum, Powick, Worcestershire, on 3 February 1883, having suffered for over two years from cerebral atrophy, and was buried at Ribbesford on 9 February. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Griffith's later eccentricities and mental decline diminished his contemporary reputation, but he can now be seen as a remarkable advocate of local rights in provincial England  (Roach, 288). Many historic schools and endowments in the region came under the reforming scrutiny of this &#145;West Midlands busybody&#146;  (Mason, 19), whose activity has been acknowledged as &#145;the only coherent attempt to create a middle-class lobby&#146; in the Victorian debate about middle-class education  (Allsobrook, 155).<br>
