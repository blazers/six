<span class="headword">Powell,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1478&#150;1540), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was born in Wales and was educated at Oxford University, where he graduated MA, became a fellow of Oriel College by 1495, and proceeded DTh on 26 June 1506. In 1501 he had been granted leave to study in Paris, where he began his theological course. He also held several administrative posts at Oriel, including those of collector of rents (1494&#150;5), junior treasurer (1499&#150;1500), chaplain (1499&#150;1501), and dean (1500&#150;01), and was made commissary to the chancellor of the university on 8 June 1508. He was ordained priest in 1499. Powell was involved in two university scandals, although neither proved damaging to his career: in 1510 he was implicated in an embezzlement scheme involving the university proctors and the keepers of the university chests, while in 1522 he was the object of a writ of <i>praemunire</i> obtained in a secular court by a scholar called Roger Cruge, leading Archbishop Warham to defend his jurisdiction as chancellor over all civil cases in the university.<br>
<br>After resigning as college chaplain Powell became rector of Bleadon, Somerset, in 1503, and in that same year was made a canon of Lincoln, where he held several prebendaries in the years that followed. In June 1507 he was made a canon of Salisbury, where he also held several prebendaries as well as being provost of St Edmund's College, Salisbury, from 1509 to 1534. His other livings included the vicarage of Powerstock, Dorset, 1522&#150;6, the vicarage of Melksham, Wiltshire, 1526&#150;34, and the rectorship of Radipole, Dorset, from 1526 to an unknown date. To allow for all his simultaneous livings Powell was granted a papal dispensation in November 1514 to hold three incompatible benefices.<br>
<br>After Henry VIII's accession in 1509 Powell became a frequent preacher at court, but his real fame began in the 1520s as an early leader in the English fight against Lutheranism. In 1521 he was commissioned to write a treatise against Luther, and in 1522 he sent Cardinal Wolsey the first instalment of his manuscript entitled <span class="italic">De immunitate ecclesiae</span>. This work won high praise, being offered to Henry VIII by the university as the best work of its kind to be written there, and it was expanded and published in 1523 as <span class="italic">Propugnaculum summi sacerdotii evangelici &hellip; adversus Martinum Lutherum</span>, a three-part dialogue between Powell and Luther defending the holiness of the pope and the seven sacraments. The book also included a lengthy list of past heresies adopted by Luther, an anti-Lutheran epigram by the Cambridge scholar William Dynham, and a preface by the prominent humanist Sir Thomas Elyot.<br>
<br>Powell's reputation for theological conservatism, while helpful in the 1520s, made him extremely controversial in the 1530s. He became one of Katherine of Aragon's theological counsellors during the king's divorce proceedings, and in 1533 he was one of the few English theologians who gave an unfavourable opinion of the king's divorce case. In that same year, when Hugh Latimer preached fiery protestant sermons at Bristol, Powell, William Hubberdyne, and Nicholas Wilson were hired by local conservatives to preach against him. In one of his sermons Powell allegedly condemned civil rulers who &#145;corrupteth and infecteth the people with open sinning and ill example of living, as he that doeth put away his first wife and taketh another without assent or dispensation of the Church&#146;. In another sermon, he argued that by virtue of the sacrament of holy orders, &#145;princes are subject to priests and prelates&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 6/3, fol. 57<i>r</i>). In 1534 he preached again in Bristol, in defence of pilgrimages.<br>
<br>Powell refused to take the oath of succession, and was thus deprived of all his benefices and committed to the Tower of London on 10 June 1534. He was attainted of treason on 3 November 1534. He was shortly thereafter moved to Dorchester gaol, where he lived in appalling conditions, set in stocks and without a bed to lie on. He was moved back to the Tower in 1535, probably as a result of his plaintive letter to Sir Thomas Arundell dated 12 April. In the Tower his conditions improved, but his gilt chalice and richly finished pax were stolen from him, allegedly by an agent of Thomas Cromwell. Powell passed the remainder of his life there, resolutely refusing to acknowledge the royal supremacy or the validity of the king's remarriage. He was executed for treason at Smithfield on 30 July 1540 as part of the king's symbolic, simultaneous execution of three protestants for heresy and three papalists for treason. Powell was brought from the Tower to Smithfield tied together with the protestant Robert Barnes, leading to the anonymous publication, soon after their deaths, of a satirical pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Metynge of Doctor Barons and Doctor Powell at Paradise Gate</span> (1540). Powell was beatified by the Roman Catholic church in 1886.<br>
