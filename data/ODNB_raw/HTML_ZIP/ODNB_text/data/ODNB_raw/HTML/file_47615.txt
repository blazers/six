<span class="headword">Wormald,  Francis</span>  (1904&#150;1972), <span class="occ">palaeographer and art historian</span>, was born at Dewsbury Mill in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 1 June 1904, shortly after his twin brother, John; their twin sisters, Ellen and Ann, were born in 1909. Their parents were Thomas Marmaduke Wormald JP (<i>d</i>. 1939), chairman of Wormalds and Walker, blanket manufacturers, of Dewsbury Mill, and Frances Mary Walker-Brook (<i>d</i>. 1920), whose family owned a woollen mill in Huddersfield. The boys were born in the mill house attached to their father's factory, but the family later moved to Field Head, a Georgian house at Mirfield. Thomas Wormald did not like his children to make friends outside the family, and they had to devise their own amusements, most of which were contrived by Francis. The only outdoor game for which he cared was croquet, which he played with pitiless proficiency all his life. Taken on a shooting expedition with his father for the first time, he was said to have bagged a snipe with his first cartridge and a brace of pheasants with the next two, but he refused to go shooting again because it hurt his hands, in which he had a slight abnormality. He liked collecting things, a lifelong passion pursued with taste and discrimination, and would scour local cottages for pieces of porcelain and trawl the Huddersfield bookshops for bargains. When he was about seven years old he was taken to the British Museum, and upon seeing the illuminated manuscripts on exhibition he decided on the spot that he would join the museum's manuscripts department.<br>
<br>The move to Mirfield brought Wormald into contact with a formative influence in his intellectual and religious life. Opposite the gates of Field Head was Hall Croft, home to the society which became the Community of the Resurrection, presided over by Walter Howard Frere, the liturgiologist. Mrs Wormald entertained the community regularly, though Mr Wormald disliked their socialistic leanings&#151;they had even dined Keir Hardie&#151;and their Anglo-Catholicism, about which Wormald and his father had many arguments. Frere ignited his interest in liturgical matters, already well developed by the time he went to Eton College, and his profound and lifelong Anglo-Catholic faith owed much to Frere's example.<br>
<br>Wormald's education began with a governess from Huddersfield and continued at Stanmore Park preparatory school. In 1918 he was sent with his brother to Eton, where he was nicknamed Tea-tray because of his fondness for what was on it. His Eton career was not distinguished scholastically, but he went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1922 and took a second class in the history tripos in 1925 (he proceeded LittD in 1950). At Cambridge he acquired the nickname Auntie and a reputation as a theatrical performer, especially as a talented comedian. After graduation he worked for a time in the Pepys Library at Magdalene.<br>
<br>In 1927 Wormald fulfilled his boyhood ambition by obtaining appointment as an assistant keeper in the department of manuscripts at the British Museum. However, his main interests&#151;illuminations and liturgies&#151;were respectively the provinces of his senior colleagues Eric Millar and A. J. Collins, and he was put to cataloguing miscellaneous papers for the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Additions to the Manuscripts</span>. He learned Portuguese to cope with some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century papers on India. He continued, however, to pursue his interests through private study and contacts with academic friends outside the museum.<br>
<br>After Mirfield and Howard Frere, the second transforming influence in Wormald's life was the migration from Hamburg to London in January 1934 of the Warburg Institute, with its galaxy of great names in the study of European art and culture, notably Fritz Saxl, Rudolf Wittkover, Hugo Buchthal, Ernst Gombrich, and Otto Pacht. Wormald was soon on terms of scholarly intimacy with all of them; he taught classes at the Warburg, and with Roger Hinks did much to establish the institute's distinguished place in the London academic scene. It was Wormald's genius to marry the European academic tradition of these learned and inspiring teachers with his distinctively English and down-to-earth approach to art-historical and iconographic studies. His observation was acute and his prose style spare, direct, and quite free from art-historical jargon. He wrote more than sixty books and articles on illuminations, iconography, liturgy, and calendars, and contributed about 100 book reviews to the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, many of which were weighty contributions to knowledge in their own right. His major publications were <span class="italic">English Benedictine Kalendars before AD 1100</span> and <span class="italic">English Benedictine Kalendars after AD 1100</span> (<span class="roman">Henry Bradshaw Society</span>, vols. 72, 1934; 77, 1939; and 81, 1946), <span class="italic">English Drawings of the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Benedictional of St Ethelwold</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">The Winchester Psalter</span> (1973). He also published important works in collaboration with other scholars, notably (with Hugo Buchthal) <span class="italic">Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</span> (1957) and (with C. E. Wright) <span class="italic">The English Library before 1700</span> (1958).<br>
<br>On 19 July 1935 Wormald married his cousin Honoria Mary Rosamund Yeo (1898&#150;1991), daughter of Gerald Yeo, a barrister, of Emsworth, Hampshire, and Margaret Leighton; she was then reading medicine at University College, London, and had just taken her first MB. A medical examination for life insurance revealed that Wormald had Bright's disease; he was given a few months to live, but the disease subsided, though it eventually returned to kill him. Very few of his friends knew of this, and the Wormalds simply decided to ignore it. They lived in Wormald's flat in Mecklenburgh Square until 1941, when they moved to Dolphin Square. Wormald spent the war years in the Ministry of Home Security, where his duties included making civil defence training films. He also did firewatching duty at St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>With the resumption of his duties in the manuscripts department after the war, Wormald rapidly consolidated his academic reputation and was regarded as the heir apparent to the then keeper, A. J. Collins. In 1950, however, at the urging of Sir Harold Idris Bell, the former keeper of manuscripts, he accepted the newly established chair of palaeography at King's College, London; a post he took up rather reluctantly, feeling, as he put it, like a cloistered monk obliged to become a bishop. He led a busy life of research, teaching, travel to foreign libraries, and service on numerous university committees, including the board of studies in palaeography, of which he was chairman 1951&#150;62, and the committee of management of the Warburg Institute. With the University of London librarian, Jack Pafford, he established the library's palaeography room, the finest in the world devoted to its subject. His palaeography classes at the Institute of Historical Research could be an alarming experience. He would distribute photographs of apparently indecipherable scripts to the class, and require each victim in turn to read his text aloud. Any prompting by others would infuriate him; he had a sharp tongue when provoked, but his essential kindness ensured no lasting hurt to those who felt it. He would patiently get a student to tease out the words of the vilest Late Roman Cursive by himself, letter by letter; &#145;What do you see?&#146;, &#145;What does it look like?&#146;, he would say again and again, until the right answer was forthcoming. He had the gift of showing students that they knew more than they thought.<br>
<br>In 1960 Wormald was appointed director of the Institute of Historical Research in succession to Sir Goronwy Edwards. His regime was like a blast of fresh air. New decorations, curtains, furnishings, and pictures swept away the institute's post-war institutional drabness, and its social life was developed with receptions and other diversions for students and staff. The Wormalds had a genius for hospitality, which they did not confine to the institute. They delighted in the company of young people, and they often entertained students in their Warwick Square flat, which was surmounted by Honoria's cherished roof-garden. They were both superb cooks, and dinner <i>chez</i> Wormald was always a memorable occasion. Francis was fond of life's pleasures, but Yorkshire canniness governed what he spent on them. At conferences abroad he would always sniff out a restaurant offering the best food at the cheapest price. His enjoyment of life was reflected in his benignly Pickwickian appearance: medium height, comfortably rotund in later years, and with round steel spectacles on a broad, friendly face.<br>
<br>Wormald's conscientiousness and common sense made him much in demand for committees. His portfolio included the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, the National Monuments Record Committee, the Advisory Council on Public Records, the Advisory Council on the Export of Works of Art, the advisory committee of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the council of the British School at Rome, the executive committee of the Friends of the National Libraries, the councils of the British Academy (of which he was elected fellow in 1948), the Royal Historical Society, the Henry Bradshaw Society, the Canterbury and York Society, the Walpole Society, the British Records Association, and the Royal Archaeological Institute. He was vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries (1956&#150;60), director (1964&#150;6), and president (1965&#150;70), and he was an ornament of the Cocked Hats, its dining club. In 1967 he was the society's statutory nominee as a trustee of the British Museum. He was elected to the Roxburghe Club in 1953 and the Society of Dilettanti in 1966. He was made honorary keeper of manuscripts at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, in 1950.<br>
<br>Among Wormald's other honours were fellowships of Magdalene College, Cambridge (1961), and King's College, London (1964), and he was also honorary fellow for life of the Pierpont Morgan Library. He was made <i>membre adh&eacute;rent</i> of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bollandistes in 1960. The University of York bestowed an honorary doctorate on him in 1969 and the University of Cambridge offered him a doctorate of laws in 1972, but he died before he could receive it. Official recognition of his services to palaeography came with his appointment as CBE in 1969. He retired as director of the Institute of Historical Research in 1968 and gave his last anniversary address to the Society of Antiquaries on 23 April 1970. Soon afterwards symptoms of his old illness returned and in September 1970 he was treated for kidney failure at St Thomas's Hospital. He was discharged and was able to complete his last book, <span class="italic">The Winchester Psalter</span>, posthumously published in 1973. He returned to St Thomas's in December 1971, but was discharged for Christmas. He returned again on 10 January 1972 and died early the next day. His funeral and cremation were private. At a service of thanksgiving for his life at his parish church, St Stephen's, Rochester Row, on 20 January 1972, the archbishop of Canterbury, a friend from Cambridge days, gave the blessing. Honoria died at Aldsworth, Sussex, on 26 November 1991.<br>
<br>Wormald's small but choice collection of manuscripts (some of which were kept in a drawer with his shirts) was divided after his death between the Fitzwilliam Museum, the British Library, the Bodleian and University of London libraries, and private beneficiaries. His fine library of about 1800 books, and the extensive remains of his incoming correspondence, formed the nucleus of the Wormald Library in the Centre for Medieval Studies, King's Manor, University of York. His collection of about 1000 offprints went to the Warburg Institute. The Society of Antiquaries owns a portrait of him as president by Hermione Hammond.<br>
