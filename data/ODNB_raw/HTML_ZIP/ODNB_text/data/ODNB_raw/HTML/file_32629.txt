<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cripps,  Charles Alfred</span>, first Baron Parmoor  (1852&#150;1941), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 3 October 1852 at West Ilsley, Berkshire, the sixth of the eleven children of Henry William Cripps (1815&#150;1899), a prominent ecclesiastical lawyer, and his wife and cousin, Julia (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16171/', "Charles Lawrence")</script>, the agriculturist. Cripps had an impressive academic career as a scholar both at Winchester College (1865&#150;71) and at New College, Oxford (1871&#150;5), where he obtained four first classes in mathematical moderations, history, jurisprudence, and civil law. He also played for the university at Association Football. He held a fellowship at St John's College, Oxford, from 1875 until 1881, when he relinquished it on his marriage on 27 October to Theresa Potter (1852&#150;1893), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36799/', "(Martha) Beatrice Webb")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51372/', "Catherine Courtney")</script>; they had four sons and one daughter, the youngest son being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32630/', "(Richard) Stafford Cripps")</script>.<br>
<br>Cripps followed his father into a professional legal career, winning a senior studentship to the inns of court in 1876. Called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1877, he published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Principles of the Law of Compensation</span> (1881), which long remained a standard work. He established a large and lucrative practice at the parliamentary bar (until he entered parliament) and in rating, patent, railway, and ecclesiastical cases. With Haldane and Asquith among his juniors, in 1890 he became a queen's counsel. He was made a bencher of his inn in 1893, was appointed attorney-general to three successive princes of Wales from 1895 to 1914, and created KCVO in 1908. He succeeded his father both as vice-chairman and, from 1910 to 1925, as chairman of Buckingham quarter sessions.<br>
<br>Cripps was proud of a long ancestry, his memoirs printing a pedigree dating from 1207, and as heir to his father's estate of about 2000 acres he counted farming as his chief recreation. He began with conventional beliefs in the priorities of private property, individualism, and personal effort, and equally conventional disapproval of the socialism of his sister- and brother-in-law Beatrice and Sidney Webb. From a strongly religious background, he had a benevolent, tolerant, and optimistic outlook, judged by the Webbs to be the characteristic complacency of a wealthy lawyer. He also had a high-church attachment to existing institutions in church and state. In contrast to his father's political Conservatism his early political opinions were Liberal, but the 1886 home-rule crisis and fear for the church turned him into a Liberal Unionist and then a Conservative. He was elected Conservative MP for the Stroud division of Gloucestershire in 1895, but lost his seat to a Liberal in the 1900 general election. He was returned for the Stretford division of Lancashire at a by-election in 1901, but was again defeated by a Liberal in the 1906 general election. After being out of parliament for four years, he was elected for the Wycombe division of Buckinghamshire in January 1910 and held the seat until January 1914, when he entered the House of Lords. As an MP he served on the select committee on the Jameson raid and the royal commission on local taxation, and hoped for appointment to one of the government law offices. During the tariff reform controversy he remained a free-trader, and during the constitutional crisis of 1910&#150;11 provided a moderating influence, helping to organize support for Balfour and Lansdowne against the Unionist radicals.<br>
<br>Cripps was most prominent in ecclesiastical issues, becoming a leading lay churchman. A representative from 1890 in the house of laymen of the Canterbury convocation, he served as its chairman from 1911 to 1919. He was chancellor and vicar-general of York province from 1900 to 1914, and from 1902 to 1924 vicar-general of Canterbury province, in which capacity he resisted objections on doctrinal grounds to two controversial episcopal appointments, Charles Gore as bishop of Winchester in 1902 and H. H. Henson as bishop of Hereford in 1918. He was a leading campaigner in defence of church schools, in 1908 opposing Archbishop Davidson's proposed compromise on the Liberal government's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> and carrying a resolution in the Representative Church Council which effectively forced the bill's withdrawal. He also criticized what he considered to be Archbishop Davidson's temporizing attitude towards the government's proposals for Welsh church disestablishment. Dissatisfied, like other high-churchmen, with parliament's interference in church matters, he took a leading part in altering the relationship. In July 1913 he successfully moved a resolution in the Representative Church Council calling for measures to secure the church's &#145;spiritual independence&#146;. From this emerged the archbishop's committee on church and state from 1913 to 1916, of which he was a member, and which recommended the establishment of the church assembly. After this had been established by the 1919 <span class="roman">Enabling Act</span>, he served from 1920 to 1924 as first chairman of the assembly's house of laity.<br>
<br>Although Cripps entered parliament as a Conservative, he received his peerage from a Liberal government and obtained office in a Labour government. Faced with a shortage of senior judges, Haldane and Asquith negotiated a special arrangement by which, in January 1914, Cripps was sworn of the privy council in order to serve as an unpaid member of its judicial committee, and was made Baron Parmoor of Frieth to enable him to undertake judicial work in the House of Lords, while retaining the freedom to continue as an active politician. During the First World War his judicial work included chairmanship of the committee to assess damage by enemy naval raids on the north-east coast, and membership of the appeal committee to hear Admiralty prize cases. But the war also began a shift in his political allegiances. He criticized Britain's entry into the war as unnecessary, disliked the war jingoism and its anti-German expressions, and came to regard the war as incompatible with Christian morality. He applied his legal expertise to assist the cause of conscientious objectors, and during 1917 publicly approved the Lansdowne letter and became chairman of a committee supporting the efforts of Archbishop S&ouml;derblum of Uppsala to restore peace by means of an International Christian Conference. A co-founder in 1915 of the League of Nations Society, in March 1918 he opened the House of Lords debate supporting the formation of a League of Nations. After the armistice he led deputations urging President Wilson and British ministers to establish the league. As chairman of a Fight the Famine council formed in January 1919, he campaigned around Britain for easier treatment of former enemy countries, visited Germany and Austria to view conditions for himself, and participated in three annual international conferences on economic recovery and world peace, as a result of which he advocated revision of the treaty of Versailles to alleviate the burden upon Germany. In 1920 he was appointed president of the Peace Society. His political reorientation was confirmed by his second marriage on 14 July 1919 to a member of a prominent Quaker family and a co-worker on his various peace committees, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56644/', "Marian Emily Ellis (1878&#150;1952)")</script>, daughter of John Edward Ellis, colliery owner and Liberal MP. Lady Parmoor was a vice-president of the World Young Women's Christian Association from 1921, and president during 1924&#150;8.<br>
<br>The &#145;horrors of the war, and the vengeful spirit&#146; had turned Parmoor &#145;into something very like an international socialist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Beatrice Webb</span>, 3.346). In the early 1920s he also criticized the coalition government's repressive policies in Ireland and, where discretion allowed, his judicial decisions revealed increased sensitivity towards social injustice and religious intolerance. In these respects he was &#145;an intriguing appellate judge&#146;  (Stevens, 259). Without becoming an economic socialist, his involvement in peace movements had brought him into contact with leading Labour politicians, notably MacDonald. When the opportunity of forming a Labour government unexpectedly arose after the 1923 election, MacDonald was hard-pressed to secure ministers in the House of Lords&#151;where the Labour Party had no recognized members&#151;and offered a choice of offices to Parmoor. After obtaining assurances on MacDonald's commitment to international reconciliation, he resigned his church positions and joined the cabinet as lord president of the council with specific responsibility for League of Nations affairs. He participated in the preparations for the London conference on German reparations, and was British representative on the League of Nations council. At the September 1924 meeting of the league assembly he strongly supported the Geneva protocol, the ultimately abortive Anglo-French proposal to establish mechanisms of international arbitration and collective security. After the government's defeat he did not return to judicial work but continued as a Labour spokesman in the House of Lords and remained active in Christian and peace movements, addressing Archbishop S&ouml;derblum's international Life and Work Conference at Stockholm in 1925.<br>
<br>On Haldane's death in 1928 Parmoor was elected Labour leader in the Lords, so when reappointed as lord president in the second Labour government in June 1929 his additional responsibility was leadership of the House of Lords rather than his previous role in League of Nations affairs. Now in his late seventies, he was too old to keep pace with an increasingly aggressive Conservative opposition, and in debates tended to become prolix and confused. In early 1931 ill health disabled him for three months, and MacDonald would have replaced him had there not been an intractable problem of inadequate numbers of possible ministerial recruits in the Lords. During the August 1931 cabinet crisis, he was one of six ministers who resisted a revenue tariff as a means of bridging the budget deficit, but was absent when the fatal vote was taken over the alternative, a cut in unemployment benefits. After the cabinet's resignation, he retired from the leadership of the Labour peers and withdrew from public life. He died at Parmoor, Henley-on-Thames, on 30 June 1941, and was buried at nearby Frieth church.<br>
