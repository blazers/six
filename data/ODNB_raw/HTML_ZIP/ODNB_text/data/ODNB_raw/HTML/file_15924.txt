<span class="headword">Lambart,  Richard Ford William</span>, seventh earl of Cavan  (1763&#150;1837), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 10 September 1763, was the only son of Richard, sixth earl (<i>d</i>. 1788), and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1811), eldest daughter of William Davies, a commissioner of the navy. He succeeded his father in 1778. He was appointed ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 2 April 1779, lieutenant in 1781, captain-lieutenant in 1790, captain and lieutenant-colonel on 23 August 1793, second major on 9 May 1800, and first major on 19 November 1800, having in the meantime attained major-general's rank in 1798. He was wounded at Valenciennes on 3 January 1793, and commanded a brigade in Ireland (Londonderry) in 1798&#150;9, and in the Ferrol expedition and before Cadiz in 1800. He commanded a line brigade in Egypt in 1801, and, when General George James Ludlow was removed to a brigade of the line on 9 August, Cavan succeeded to the command of the brigade of guards. As part of Eyre Coote's division the brigade was sent to attack Alexandria from the westward. The city surrendered on 2 September 1801. When Lord Hutchinson left in October, Cavan succeeded to the command of the whole army remaining in Egypt, including the troops under David Baird. Cavan held a brigade command in the eastern counties in England during the invasion alarms of 1803&#150;4, and in 1805 was lieutenant-general commanding in the Isle of Wight. He was a knight of the Crescent, and was one of the six officers, besides Lord Nelson, who received the diamond aigrette. He became a full general in 1814, and was in succession colonel-commandant of a 2nd battalion 68th foot, and colonel of the 2nd West Indian and 45th regiments. He was governor of Calshot Castle, Hampshire, from 1813 until his death.<br>
<br>Cavan married first, on 8 July 1782, Honora Margaretta (<i>d</i>. 1813), youngest daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11152/', "Sir Henry Gould (1710&#150;1794)")</script>, and second on 11 August 1814, Lydia, second daughter of William Arnold of Slatswood, Isle of Wight. With his first wife he had three sons and three daughters; the only surviving son, George Frederick Augustus Lambart, Viscount Kilcoursie, predeceased his father, leaving a large family. With his second wife, who died on 7 February 1862, Cavan had three sons and a daughter. He died at Stanhope Place, Hyde Park, on 21 November 1837, and was succeeded by his grandson.<br>
