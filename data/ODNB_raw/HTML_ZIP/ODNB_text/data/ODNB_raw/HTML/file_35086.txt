<span class="headword">Moor, Sir  Ralph Denham Rayment</span>  (1860&#150;1909), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was born on 31 July 1860 at The Lodge, Furneux Pelham, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, son of William Henry Moor (<i>c</i>.1830&#150;<i>c</i>.1863), surgeon, and his wife, Sarah Pears. Educated privately after his father's death, he worked in the tea trade before entering the Royal Irish Constabulary as a cadet on 26 October 1882, becoming in due course a district inspector. After involvement in a divorce case, he resigned on 9 February 1891, and undertook to raise a constabulary force of Hausa and Gold Coasters to serve in the Oil Rivers protectorate.<br>
<br>Having impressed the consul-general, Sir Claude Macdonald, by his military efficiency, Moor was in 1892 transferred to political duties as vice-consul. He soon showed himself prepared to act forcefully to assert British authority, and on 1 February 1896 succeeded Macdonald as commissioner and consul-general of what was now called the Niger Coast protectorate. Moor recorded his intention of extending British influence to the interior by peaceful expeditions and collaboration with African rulers, but first saw it necessary to enforce their acknowledgement of British supremacy. Already in 1894, as Macdonald's deputy, Moor had enforced the deposition and exile of the Itsekiri chief Nana Olomu; he now resolved to take strong measures against the Edo kingdom of Benin, and encouraged his deputy, James R. Phillips, in his ill-fated mission of January 1897. Returning from leave, Moor joined the expeditionary force of Admiral H. H. Rawson which within a month avenged the deaths of Phillips's party, looted the art works of Benin city, and established British control. In May Moor was appointed KCMG.<br>
<br>The British government now decided to establish unified and effective colonial administration over a wider region. In January 1900 Moor became high commissioner (under the Colonial Office) for the protectorate of Southern Nigeria. This comprised a union of the Niger Coast protectorate with the former territories of the Royal Niger Company, but not, as Moor had hoped, with the Lagos protectorate. Moor tried to create a structure for peaceful development by extending Macdonald's practice of designating warrant chiefs to form native councils and native courts. These expedients, devised with little knowledge of how these small-scale societies governed themselves, were to cause problems to his successors, but immediately they provided sufficient stability to permit rapid growth in exports. Moor remained very ready to use armed force, notably in the Aro expedition of 1901, but his commitment to economic development is acknowledged by Nigerian historians. He hoped to substitute currency transactions for barter and to encourage reluctant British traders to move inland by improving transport, but could not persuade the British government to invest in railways. The forestry department which he founded served the cause of conservation by supervising and controlling the tapping of wild rubber and the felling of hardwoods.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1903 Moor retired on grounds of ill health. He had hoped for more than the minor committee appointments offered by the Colonial Office, but he became a director of Alfred Lewis Jones's African Steam Ship Company, and worked for the British Cotton Growing Association. In 1898 he had married Mrs Adrienne Burns, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shapland (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1871), an attractive divorcee, but does not seem to have found happiness. On 14 September 1909 he was found dead at his home, The Homestead, Church Road, Barnes, having committed suicide by poison. His wife survived him.<br>
