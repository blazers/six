<span class="headword">Wilford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gale]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1559), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was probably born in the parish of St George, Botolph Lane, London, the only surviving child of Thomas Gale (<i>d</i>. 1540), a freeman of the Haberdashers' Company of London, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1546), the daughter of William Wilkinson, of the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, and his wife, Elizabeth. Her father was active in Iberian commerce, and possessed connections to the prominent London merchants William Locke and Sir George Barnes. She married on or around 1 September 1529 Nicholas Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1551), a freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company, the fifth son of James Wilford, a merchant taylor, sheriff, and alderman of London, and was identified in her marriage indentures as the principal beneficiary of her father's substantial estate. Her husband began his career as a merchant in Bilboa, Spain, in the 1520s, became a substantial English cloth exporter, served as auditor of the City of London (1545&#150;7), represented London in the 1542 parliament, and became a governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital. Following her marriage Elizabeth resided first in the parish of St Bartholomew-the-Less and later, after her mother's death, in her parents' capital tenement and shops in Botolph Lane. She and her husband were also parishioners and property holders of Wandsworth, Surrey. They had four sons and seven daughters: Thomas, who in 1560 married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir James Hawes; William, who died childless; Robert, who in 1575 married Mary Watson; Edmond, who died in infancy; Elizabeth, who married, first, John Kidderminster and, second, Robert Gage; Anne, who married, first, John Webbe, alias Killiho, and, second, Gabriel White; Parnell, who <i>c</i>.1565&#150;6 married William Towerson; another Elizabeth; Grace; Martha, who married Francis Cressett; and Joyce. Several of the children and their spouses became nationally prominent. The eldest son, Thomas, a freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company, was a common councilman (1561&#150;99) and chamberlain of the City (1591&#150;1603). William Towerson (<i>d</i>. 1584) was the noted developer of commerce with equatorial west Africa whose exploits were described by Richard Hakluyt in his <span class="italic">Principal Navigations</span>; Gabriel Towerson (1576&#150;1623), a grandson of Elizabeth Wilford, was the chief factor of the East India Company executed by the Dutch at Amboyna.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Wilford was active as a cloth exporter in her widowhood following her husband's death in the London outbreak of the sweating sickness of 1551. She was one of only two women to appear among the 201 founding members of the Muscovy or Russia Company in 1555, and the only one to invest in her own right, without a spouse. In the absence of business or family papers, she can rarely be viewed outside the circumstances of her domestic life during marriage and widowhood. Her last will of 1559 is typical of her position and sex for this period in its elaborate disposal of possessions within her extended family. Although she moved in socially prominent circles (one nephew was Sir James Wilford MP, and a distinguished mid-Tudor soldier; her brothers-in-law included Sir John (later Lord) Mordaunt; and among her husband's business associates were three lord mayors of London), her first known public act was as executrix for the estate of her deceased husband. Under the terms of Nicholas Wilford's will she probably received in excess of &pound;1000, besides a life interest in all the property in Surrey and the London family residence. In view of the Wilford family's close association with the two innovative long-distance trading destinations of the 1550s, Russia and west Africa, investment in the Russia voyages was a logical move in her widowhood.<br>
<br>Wilford dated her will 31 March 1559; she must have died shortly afterwards, as it was proved on the following 19 April. She was buried beside her husband in the parish church of St George, Botolph Lane. She was evidently raised by Catholic parents and died in the old faith, requesting prayers for the health of her soul.<br>
