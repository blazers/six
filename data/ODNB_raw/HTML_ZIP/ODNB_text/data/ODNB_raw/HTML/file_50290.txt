<span class="headword">Anstey,  Rhoda</span>  (1865&#150;1936), <span class="occ">promoter of women's physical education</span>, was born at Jurishayes Farm near Tiverton, Devon, on 15 April 1865, the seventh of nine children and second daughter of John Walters Anstey, a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Susanna Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Manley. She was a natural countrywoman with a great love of the county of her birth; in 1891 she was managing the dairy on the family farm. Little else is known of her early life before she attended Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg's Hampstead Physical Training College, where she was a student from 1893 to 1895. The curriculum at Hampstead was based on Ling's Swedish system of gymnastics. &#145;The fundamental principle of Ling's System is the harmonious development of mind and body, the mind to be dominant, the body obedient&#146;, Anstey wrote in 1912  (Webb, &#145;Women's physical education&#146;, 129 n. 7). She was a keen and sensitive student, with an intense interest in the subject, rising early to practise cricket on Hampstead Heath before breakfast. During her training she saw that the development of professional teaching careers opened great possibilities for the future of physical education, especially for women and girls.<br>
<br>Anstey's initial interest was in remedial gymnastics and in 1895 she opened a health centre, the Hygienic Home for Ladies, at New Cross Farm, South Petherton. With &pound;100 as her capital, she moved her centre in 1897 to The Leasowes, Halesowen, Worcestershire, the former home of the poet William Shenstone. Healing came through her fingers, which aroused the antagonism of the local medical profession, among whom she was known as the Heretic. A vegetarian and keen theosophist with an interest in astrology, she found great value in meditation. Her attire was unconventional: a supporter of dress reform, she went corsetless, and wore a djibbah and sandals. She had an upright, dignified carriage and walked with a light, swift, decisive step&#151;almost a run.<br>
<br>Anstey soon realized that with educational as well as remedial training her students would be better qualified to take up teaching posts. She therefore founded in the premises of her clinic at Halesowen, in 1897, the Anstey Physical Training College, a private institution which was, after Hampstead, the second specialist college of physical training for women students who wanted to qualify as teachers of physical education in Great Britain. A chance meeting at the college in 1898 led to the formation of the Ling Association, whose ideas she actively promoted.<br>
<br>The first students at the Anstey Physical Training College assisted with the treatments for patients as well as qualifying for the new profession of trained gymnastics teachers. They were admitted between the ages of eighteen and twenty-eight years and had to hold either a certificate from a recognized examining board or produce other evidence of a good general education. Between 1897 and 1919 they followed a two-year course covering practical and theoretical work, teaching practice, and clinics. Students visited Birmingham University for anatomy and dissections, travelling the six miles from Halesowen by pony and open wagonette. From 1919 the course was lengthened to three years with extended teaching practices and medical gymnastics. Anstey, as a physical culturalist, aimed to <blockquote>send out women trained in mind and character as well as in body, to spread a knowledge of physiology and the laws of health; to work in schools for the advancement of physical education and for the prevention of deformity and imperfect bodily development, which often arises out of the conditions of school life, as well as to cure ailments and deformities where they exist.(1904; Crunden, 14)</blockquote>In 1907 Anstey purchased Yew Tree House, Chester Road, Erdington, and moved the college there, so that students at the college would have easier access to schools, particularly girls' secondary schools, for teaching practice. Gradually she extended the professional and residential accommodation. Anstey was committed to service to the community and from the earliest days students took classes with factory girls' teams and clubs in Birmingham. Gymnastics and dance displays were regular features for both the students and the girls' clubs. Her belief in mottoes took physical form around the college. Displayed on the gates was the college motto, <i>Vis atque gratia harmoniaque</i> (&#145;Strength, grace, and harmony&#146;). The gymnasium and common room walls were adorned with sayings such as &#145;In quietness and confidence shall be your strength&#146;, &#145;strength together with grace and harmony&#146;, &#145;God was goodness and goodness was God&#146;, and &#145;The body is the instrument of the mind and the habitation of the spirit&#146;.<br>
<br>Anstey was a strong supporter of the women's suffrage movement, hosting campaign meetings at her college and providing special lectures for the students. She was one of the original members of the Gymnastic Teachers' Suffrage Society, formed in January 1909. The initial objective of the society was &#145;to ascertain the numerical strength of suffragists in the profession and to protect the profession from restrictive legislation&#146; (cited in Webb, &#145;Women's physical education&#146;, 306). She led her staff and students in the great suffrage demonstrations in London in 1910 and 1911 where they marched strictly in time and step, wearing short blue skirts, college blouses, and badges, under the Gymnastic Teachers' banner, and carried the Swedish colours.<br>
<br>In 1915 Anstey purchased an additional plot of land at the rear of the college which was developed for games practices. She also had Lavender Cottage built where she lived with the three girls whom she informally adopted in 1919, when they were aged six, four, and two respectively. They were formally adopted on 13 May 1927. After being taken seriously ill in 1918, she went into semi-retirement and lived for a time in Cheltenham, but resumed her involvement with the college in 1920 as joint principal, her colleague Ida Bridgman taking day-to-day control until they both retired in 1927.<br>
<br>In 1929 Anstey was seriously ill with pneumonia. She died of heart failure and thyrotoxicosis on 27 February 1936 at the Duchess Nursing Home, 2 Beaumont Street, Marylebone, London, after an operation from which she never recovered consciousness. She was buried at Cheltenham on 2 March. A visionary, with an independent and original turn of mind, she held a deep religious conviction and was utterly fearless in carrying out any project she believed in, undeterred by adverse opinion or circumstance.<br>
