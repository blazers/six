<span class="headword">Preston,  George Dawson</span>  (1896&#150;1972), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 8 August 1896 at Bardowie, Orwell Park, Rathgar, Dublin, the eldest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37862/', "Professor Thomas Preston (1860&#150;1900)")</script>, physicist, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48676/', "Katherine Mary Preston, n&#233;e McEwen (1868&#150;1951)")</script>, eldest daughter of Thomas McEwen, headmaster, of Baldernock, Stirlingshire, and his first wife, Eliza Gray Mann; at the time of George's birth his mother was lecturer in Italian and she later became lady principal of Alexandra College, Dublin.<br>
<br>Preston's father died in 1900 leaving the family in reduced circumstances until 1910, when they inherited family property in co. Armagh. He attended school in Dublin and at thirteen won a scholarship to Oundle School, chosen on advice from his father's successor as HM inspector of schools, Sir Robert Blair, that it was the best school for science in the UK. In 1915 Preston won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, but, against the advice of his headmaster, Dr Sanderson, chose to enlist instead. Soon after, in a near-fatal hand-grenade incident, Preston lost his right patella, resulting in a permanent &#145;gammy&#146; leg and a 75 per cent pension from his military service; he was also infected with tuberculosis. Preston was posted to the Ministry of Pensions, but at the armistice&#151;by then a lieutenant and assistant adjutant of 49 squadron, Royal Flying Corps&#151;decided to &#145;desert&#146;, as he described it, and went to Jamaica for a year to recuperate.<br>
<br>Preston finally took up his place at Gonville and Caius in 1920. In Cambridge he met Margaret Chrystal (1898&#150;1994), also a physicist, and daughter of Captain Alexander Chrystal; they were married in 1924 after a four-year engagement. Preston was awarded a double first in the natural sciences tripos and became Sir Ernest Rutherford's graduate student working in the new field of X-ray crystallography.<br>
<br>In 1922 Preston moved to the department of metallurgy at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where until 1943 he pursued topics within the emerging mainstream of X-ray crystallography as well as in a branch of related research, electron microscopy. His interests ranged from the study of molecular structures by X-ray methods to thermal vibrations in the crystal lattice and oxidization in metals. One result of his early career, the Gunier&#150;Preston layer, a clustering of solute atoms during precipitation hardening, was named after him.<br>
<br>In 1938 Preston was promoted to senior scientific officer at the NPL and from this time, although still active in other research, he led British work on electron microscopy. His pioneer apparatus had a magnification of only about &times; 600 diameters, roughly the limit of optical microscopy. Funding for this was withdrawn in the year prior to the outbreak of the Second World War: the decision, ultimately made by the Home Office on a cost-cutting initiative, meant that American research soon outstripped the British effort, producing the Metro-Vic electron microscope which magnified &times; 15,000 diameters. Preston was elected by fellow scientists to the Whitley Council in 1940 to represent them in negotiations with the relevant government bodies. He felt that the decision to cut funds for electron microscopy had been a political one, on the grounds that there was no practical application for such a device, but its true worth soon became apparent. By 1941 two Metro-Vic microscopes had been sent from the United States on separate ships; the first became a U-boat casualty, but the second machine was used under Preston's supervision.<br>
<br>The initial focus of research was on war-related issues, and the apparatus was used to study viral and bacterial specimens in conjunction with agricultural research at Rothamsted, especially in response to crop diseases and the overall food shortage. Other research was in metallurgy and mineralogy, notably of coal. At the time of Dunkirk some Bren gun breech-blocks were exploding and crews were reluctant to fire them. The NPL metallurgy team soon found the cause and Preston, as a veteran, was able to convince the military that the new block was safe.<br>
<br>In 1942, despite his role in halting research four years earlier, home secretary Sir J. Anderson planned to visit Preston's laboratory and to become the first non-scientist in Europe to witness the capabilities of electron microscopy. On 26 December, just prior to the visit, Preston pre-empted him by smuggling his own young son Tom past NPL security to secretly claim this first. Anderson was subsequently informed by Preston that he had not actually been the first non-scientist in Europe to see beyond the limits of light.<br>
<br>In 1943 Preston was appointed by St Andrews University to the Harris chair of natural philosophy at Queen's College, Dundee. He had proceeded ScD of Cambridge University in that year. In Scotland he continued work in electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and diffraction grids, becoming a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and fellow of the Institute of Physics in 1944. As chairman of the 1947 Electron Microscope Society meeting, Preston remarked that &#145;as three dimensional images can be made with electrons, it ought also to be possible to do so with light&#146;. Later Dennis Gabor, inventor of holography, attributed his idea of &#145;incoherent light in contrast to coherent electrons&#146; to Preston's words.<br>
<br>Although his appointment was for life Preston retired when he was about seventy. His main intellectual activity and hobby was the study of quaternions while for exercise he gardened at his mansion, Craigellie, Alyth, in Perthshire. He shunned the limelight, declining potential honours, finding it convenient to say that the ceremonies would be too tiring on his old war wound. He died at Meigle Cottage Hospital, Perth, on 22 June 1972, survived by his widow and four children, Margaret, Thomas, Mary, and George.<br>
