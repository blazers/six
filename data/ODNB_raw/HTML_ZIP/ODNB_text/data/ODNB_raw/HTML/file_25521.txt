<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sidney,  Henry</span>, first earl of Romney  (1641&#150;1704), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was born in Paris during the spring of 1641. He was the fourth surviving and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester (1595&#150;1677)")</script>, and Dorothy Percy (<i>bap</i>. 1598, <i>d</i>. 1659), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Sidney grew up at the Sidney family seat, Penshurst Place, Kent, a favourite of his mother and an unusually good-looking child as an early portrait of him by Lely reveals. Much of his youth was spent in the company of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26135/', "Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland")</script>, son of his older sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26120/', "Dorothy Spencer, countess of Sunderland")</script>, but almost an exact contemporary in age. Apparently educated together under the tutelage of Dr Thomas Pierce, the two boys became fast and lifelong friends. Sidney and Sunderland travelled on the continent in Pierce's charge in 1658&#150;9 and made a return visit a few years later with Henry Savile, spending the better part of 1664 in Italy as part of a congenial group of young Englishmen that also included Henry Compton, Sidney Godolphin, and William Trumbull. Sidney then gravitated to the court of Charles II looking for employment, as did many other landless younger sons of good family. It was about this time, according to the <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires de la vie du comte de Gramont</span>, that he courted Anne Temple (<i>d</i>. 1718), who later married Sir Charles Lyttelton. He may also have been involved simultaneously in a relationship with Grace Worthley, a widow of some social standing&#151;she was related to several landed Cheshire families, including the Gerards, Fittons, and Minishulls&#151;with whom he had a son, Henry Worthley. Grace Worthley remained his mistress until about 1682, when Sidney seems to have abandoned her, perhaps to help with protracted marriage negotiations over a Dutch heiress.<br>
<br>Sidney's charm also helped him towards office. In 1665 he secured appointment as groom of the bedchamber to James, duke of York, and subsequently as master of the horse to the latter's wife, Anne. &#145;The hansomest youth of his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 55), Sidney allowed himself to get caught up in a serious flirtation with the duchess, which led to his dismissal after their conduct became the subject of widespread gossip. His offence, however, was not serious enough to deny him a commission in 1667 as captain of a new company of foot added to the Holland regiment commanded by his brother Robert. In the following year, while stationed at Carlisle, he declared his candidacy in a by-election at Appleby, but withdrew in the face of powerful local interest exercised on behalf of Thomas Tufton. In 1669 and again in 1672 he visited France on extended leave, the second time carrying a message of condolence from Charles II to Louis XIV upon the death of the latter's daughter.<br>
<br>Charles appointed Sidney master of the robes in July 1675, a post he purchased and which returned a minimum of &pound;500 annually if managed properly. In a real sense it represented Sidney's first step out of relative obscurity.<h2>
<a name="TheNetherlands"></a>The Netherlands</h2>A more decisive development came on 25 February 1678, when Sidney was commissioned as colonel to raise a new regiment of foot. That May the regiment was sent to join the British expeditionary force in Flanders, and while there he established the beginnings of a friendship with William, prince of Orange, marked by a depth and &#145;dignified by consistency of which the time affords few examples&#146;  (Foxcroft, 1.165). The relationship became a factor in the decision taken in June 1679 to send him as envoy-extraordinary to the states general of the United Provinces, an appointment engineered by Sunderland, then secretary of state for the north, but also supported by Sir William Temple, Sidney's immediate predecessor at The Hague as well as another good friend and something of a mentor. His official brief was to maintain a defensive alliance with the Netherlands, a fixed point of English foreign policy since the Danby ministry. It was a difficult assignment, given doubts about whether Charles II could secure the backing of parliament if a crisis arose. The situation was further complicated that autumn when the French ambassador Count D'Avaux launched a serious effort to win over the Dutch, a move that would have left England diplomatically isolated and the Southern Netherlands vulnerable. During negotiations in late December 1679 Sidney trumped the French with a proposal to the states general actually drafted at a secret meeting with the grand pensionary, Gaspar Fagel, and William himself. News of the Dutch decision to ratify a new treaty redounded to his credit. The countess of Sunderland, as frequent a correspondent as her husband, wrote early in the new year that Sidney's &#145;praise is up to great height, your health drank with great ceremony in the City, and everybody that's good for any thing talks of you as their guardian angel almost&#146;  (countess of Sunderland to Sidney, 13 Jan 1680, <span class="italic">Diary of &hellip; Sidney</span>, 1.231). In addition to such public business, however, he also had a brief from Sunderland and a group of moderates on the privy council to serve as a private conduit of information to and from the prince. Sunderland, in particular, used him repeatedly to advocate the importance of the prince's coming over to England. There, William could protect the rights of his wife during the exclusion crisis, and counter the activities of Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, and the pretensions of James Scott, duke of Monmouth, to the succession.<br>
<br>Sidney was not a member of the first Exclusion Parliament, and was abroad when elections were held to the second, later in summer 1679. A promise by William Harbord to secure him or Sir William Temple a seat at Launceston, Cornwall, came to nothing, but Sidney was returned from Bramber, Sussex, after his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25519/', "Algernon Sidney")</script>&#151;with whom he was not on good terms&#151;was forced out of the contest. Judicious expenditure of almost &pound;300 by Gilbert Spence, a trusted family retainer, and the influence of his brother-in-law Sir John Pelham were sufficient to win over a constituency in which he was unknown. There followed a year-long series of prorogations, a conscious policy of delay pursued by Charles II in the hopes that passions would cool. Finally in September 1680 Sidney returned to London in the expectation that parliament would be allowed to meet, and was party to a series of meetings aimed at trying to forge a coalition perhaps willing to accommodate exclusion, but bent on foreclosing the possibility of Monmouth's coming to power. Generally counted a whig at this time by historians of the period, Sidney took his seat in the Commons in late October, but was assigned to no committees and, Rapin and Cobbett to the contrary, left no record of participation in the debates that took place during the first week or so of the session. In fact, by 3 November he was back at The Hague under instruction from Sunderland to make a last-ditch effort to persuade the prince of Orange to declare his interest.<br>
<br>News that the House of Lords had rejected exclusion produced a Dutch crisis of confidence in an alliance with a nation so deeply divided. It was at this point that Sidney finally abandoned the delicate political balance that had allowed him to serve Charles II while discreetly advancing William's cause simultaneously. On 25 November he transmitted to the king a memorial from the states general urging him to come to terms with parliament and suggesting indirectly that acceptance of exclusion was the only way to do so. By a manoeuvre instigated by William with the assistance of both Fagel and Sidney, D'Avaux reported to Louis XIV that the English envoy had even gone so far as to send off manuscript copies to friends in parliament, thereby virtually ensuring the document would appear in print. Sidney's actions at this time were supported and prompted by William and Fagel. Just his agency in the document's delivery was sufficient to earn Sidney the king's displeasure and a stern reprimand, which was delivered through secretary of state Leoline Jenkins now that Sunderland had fallen from power. While the prince of Orange and others expected the affair would lead to Sidney's immediate recall, it was not until June 1681 that he was summoned back to England and received by Charles more graciously than expected. Contrary to expectations Sidney was allowed to retain his position as master of the robes, and ultimately received reimbursement for all outstanding expenses from his embassy. However, the king did reject a request from William later that summer to appoint Sidney commanding general of the British brigade in the service of the states general, but early in 1682 he was given leave to return to the Netherlands to take up a commission as colonel of one of the six regiments. Thereafter he disappeared from the English political stage for the remainder of the reign, apart from an unsuccessful attempt to intercede on behalf of his brother Algernon after the latter's conviction for treason in late 1683. Sidney was allowed to arrange for Algernon's burial at Penshurst and to claim his estate.<h2>
<a name="Therevolution"></a>The revolution</h2>With the accession of James II, Sidney lost his position at court and was recalled from military service in the Netherlands in the spring of 1685. Unlike the case of a number of other officers removed about the same time, his loyalty was never in question. Rather, it was a case of James's asserting his right to select the commander of the British forces in the Netherlands, a position Sidney had managed to secure <i>de facto</i> during the last years of the reign of Charles II, even though lacking appropriate military rank. Given dim prospects of alternative employment in the new regime, he left for the continent in November 1685, and the following year found him variously at The Hague, with William at a meeting of German princes at Cleves, and, both Burnet and Macky suggest, travelling in Italy for more than just pleasure. Sidney's especial value to the prince, however, was as a point of contact with members of his own class in England out of sympathy with James during a period of watchful waiting in 1686 and the earlier part of 1687, and then proving adept at taking on a more proactive role on his behalf after news of the queen's pregnancy radically changed the dynamics of the equation. As William gravitated toward a firm decision to intervene directly, Sidney was &#145;the man in whose hands the conduct of the whole design was chiefly deposited, by the prince's own order&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 3.264). Only six others&#151;Bishop Compton, Danby, Devonshire, Lumley, Admiral Russell, and Shrewsbury&#151;joined him in adding their ciphers to the cautiously phrased invitation sent off on 30 June 1688. None the less the conspiracy had a considerably broader base of support, or at least promises of neutrality from some of more timorous temperament, with the secret so well kept that Sidney could secure an official pass to take the waters at Aix-la-Chapelle when he left to join the prince in late August.<br>
<br>By mid-September, according to Luttrell, Sidney had been commissioned a major-general in the invasion force. He landed with William at Torbay on 5 November 1688. His role as a senior commanding officer, member of the general staff, and long-time confidant of William was very important, but in the absence of any serious military engagement that autumn it received little or no attention in contemporary accounts of the drama unfolding. In January 1689 Sidney secured a seat in the convention after a contested election at Tamworth. He is classed by Burnet, in the supplement to his <span class="italic">History</span>, as one of the moderate Church of England men constant in their support for putting William and Mary on the throne, but in general he does not figure prominently in the proceedings of the lower House. In coronation day honours he was created Baron Milton and Viscount Sydney of Sheppey on 9 April 1689, and took his seat in the House of Lords less than a week later. Other tokens of royal favour and friendship recognized both his vital contribution to the success of the revolution and a continuing record of military and administrative service. In mid-February 1689 William had made him a member of the privy council, and that same year he was also appointed lord lieutenant and vice-admiral of Kent, a justice of the peace, and <i>custos rotulorum</i> for the county, and in 1691 lord warden of the Cinque Ports and constable of Dover Castle. He retained most of these positions until his death, though in 1692 and 1693 he shared the lord lieutenancy of Kent with Vere Fane, fourth earl of Westmorland, because of commitments in Ireland. Sydney (his peerage name) was also first gentleman of the bedchamber (1689&#150;1700) and groom of the stole (1700&#150;02). Important to him professionally were a commission as colonel of the 1st regiment of foot guards (1689&#150;90 and again 1693&#150;1704) and a special non-regimental commission in May 1691 as commander of all foot in the king's absence while on campaign with William in Flanders. Sydney was also the recipient of a grant of almost 50,000 acres in Ireland in 1690, but title to it and a substantial annual income were lost with the resumption of Irish forfeitures by parliament in 1699.<h2>
<a name="IntheserviceofWilliamIII"></a>In the service of William III</h2>The final phase of Sydney's career can be said to have begun in the summer of 1690, when he accompanied William III to Ireland, continuing a family tradition of involvement in Irish affairs dating back to the reign of Elizabeth I. Both his father and elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25523/', "Philip Sidney, third earl of Leicester")</script>, had held high office in the Irish administration. He was one of the principal officers at the battle of the Boyne and during the mop-up operation that followed, including the siege at Limerick, where the troops he commanded personally had some success before the king withdrew in the face of bad weather. At the beginning of September, William returned to England after naming Sydney and Thomas Coningsby lords justices to act in his stead, with a third person to be added to the commission at a later date. It was a particularly difficult assignment, with military operations still in progress and widespread economic distress and popular unrest a constant worry. Almost immediately the two men issued a series of proclamations from Dublin aimed at trying to restore some degree of order and stability, but nothing much of substance was accomplished before Sydney was recalled in early December to take on the post of secretary of state for the north. During his first few months in office he was based in London, while his counterpart, Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham, and William went to The Hague. The two secretaries then swapped places after the king briefly returned to England in April 1691, and then set off for a summer campaign in Flanders, for which Sydney's credentials as a seasoned military commander made him doubly useful, as well as a congenial companion.<br>
<br>Shortly after Sydney and the king returned to England in October, rumours about the possibility of his appointment as lord lieutenant of Ireland began to circulate: however, it was not until the beginning of March 1692 that he surrendered his seals of office, and the middle of that month before his new commission officially took effect. In two sets of instructions William gave Sydney extensive powers over both the civil administration and all military forces, as well as a particular mandate to summon parliament to ratify the provisions of the articles of Limerick signed the year before. The king also provided him with an annual salary in excess of &pound;6500, a substantial supply of plate, and an additional allowance of &pound;3000 for equipage. Various factors conspired to delay Sydney's departure, but he finally arrived in Dublin at the end of August, and immediately issued writs summoning parliament to meet on 5 October. It was a session that spun out of control quickly. An exclusively protestant lower house vehemently opposed making a reality out of promises of toleration for Catholics, and a request for new taxes to help cover an anticipated shortfall between revenues and expenditures gave it some leverage in the situation. Even though Sydney seems to have understood that it would be difficult to get the king's business done without organizing a leadership group in the Commons, his lack of success in doing so tempted, if it did not actually provoke, the constitutional challenge to Poynings' law that followed. On 3 November Sydney prorogued parliament after delivering a stiff speech on the rights and prerogatives of the crown, even though it meant losing the tax bills pending. Echoes of the dispute were carried to England that winter by six members of the Irish Commons who met with William, as well as with committees from both houses of parliament, in an attempt to explain their conduct and to further their complaint that Sydney was too tolerant of Catholics, and a corrupt administrator as well. Although the king's support was unwavering, clearly his lord lieutenant had become sufficiently compromised in the eyes of the emerging protestant ascendancy to have lost his effectiveness.<br>
<br>Sydney's recall from Dublin came in late spring 1693, and on 28 July it was followed by appointment to the office of master-general of the ordnance. The post represented neither a sop intended to allow him to save face, nor simply a vehicle for lining his pockets, as some have alleged. Rather, given William's military ambitions and the functions attaching to the job since the department had been reconstituted in 1683, it was a substantial vote of confidence in Sydney's abilities. William's continued respect for Sydney's qualities was confirmed in May 1694, when he was promoted lieutenant-general and created earl of Romney. For the remaining years of the reign Romney was immersed in matters ranging from weapons development and procurement, to construction and maintenance of fortifications and supply depots throughout the British Isles and the colonies. Provision of armaments and munitions for the fleet and efficient dispatch of trains of artillery to the continent were the obvious business with which he dealt, but a host of lesser matters occupied his attention as well&#151;including arrangements for spectacular public firework displays in St James's Square to celebrate the great victory at Namur in 1695, and again on the king's birthday and return to England after the treaty of Ryswick was signed in 1697. In that same year Romney was called upon for the first time to serve as one of the lords justices while William was abroad, and it is also when he purchased the office of ranger of Greenwich Park from Charles Sackville, fourth earl of Dorset, to have use of the Queen's House as his equivalent of a country seat. During Peter the Great's stay in England in the winter of 1698, Romney showed off new naval construction to the tsar, and also helped William entertain his difficult guest privately. He was again appointed a lord justice later that spring, and then in each of the following three years accompanied the king to The Hague, where, in the summer of 1701, Luttrell notes that he was associated with John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, during the negotiations leading to a revival of the grand alliance against France.<br>
<br>The death of William III and the accession of Queen Anne led Romney largely to disappear from the political stage. His employments at court came to an end immediately, though he was continued as lord lieutenant of Kent and granted a handsome pension. A man really outside party in the years after the revolution, Romney continued to attend sessions of the House of Lords on occasion, but was never much interested in the parliamentary arena and not an influential voice there. He died of smallpox on 8 April 1704 at his house, 16 St James's Square, and was buried ten days later in the chancel of St James's, Piccadilly. While the circumstances of his death were noted by a few contemporaries, he had already begun to slip into relative obscurity after the passing of Sunderland and William III had removed the men who defined the parameters of his public life.<br>
<br>Romney has been the subject of widely divergent views about both his capacity and character. Macaulay dismissively described him as &#145;incapable, ignorant, and dissipated&#146;  (Macaulay, 3.1050), and insisted elsewhere that the invitation to William must have been &#145;drawn up by some person better skilled than Sydney in the art of composition&#146;  (ibid., 3.1053), despite the fact that the document is in his hand. In turn, Macaulay seems to have been influenced by Jonathan Swift's disparaging references, one differing only slightly from the other, to the effect that Romney was &#145;an idel, drunken, ignorant rake, without sense or honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Works</span>, 5.288). Thomas Bruce, second earl of Ailesbury, hardly a friendly witness, took a much more charitable view of his character, while John Macky called him the linchpin of the planning effort for the revolution, a man of honour and honesty who served William to the best of his ability. Both Burnet's <span class="italic">History</span> and the supplement to that work provide an even fuller portrait. It is certainly one of an individual with flaws, but also remarkable for his even temper, straight dealing, good judgement, and a knack for gaining the trust of others. Perhaps more dependable than gifted, Romney becomes in this view a person in whom it then becomes possible to understand why William placed such a high degree of confidence over such a long period of time.<br>
