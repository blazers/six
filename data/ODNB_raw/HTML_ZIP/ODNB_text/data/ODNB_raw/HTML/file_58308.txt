<span class="headword">Woodham,  Henry Annesley</span>  (1813&#150;1875), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was baptized on 1 September 1813 in the parish church of Newbury, Berkshire, where his father, Henry Edward Higmore Woodham, was a solicitor. His mother, Elizabeth Spooner Woodham (<i>d</i>. 1857), was the daughter of Thomas Lamb, a surgeon in Newbury. He was educated, like George Canning before him, at the Revd Charles Richards's school in Winchester, and at Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College on 20 October 1834. In February 1835 he migrated to Jesus College, and was elected a foundation scholar there at midsummer. Between 1837 and 1839 he twice won the members' prize for Latin orations, and in 1839 came fifth in the classical tripos. In December 1841 he was the first fellow of Jesus to be elected under the new college statutes. In 1843 he published an edition of Tertullian's <span class="italic">Apologeticus</span>, a competent rather than a distinguished performance, apparently intended for undergraduate use. His second and last avowed book appeared in 1846, <span class="italic">An Application of Heraldry to the Illustration of Various University and College Antiquities</span>, but his literary career was just beginning rather than ending, for in 1845 he became one of the university men whom the new editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, J. T. Delane, was recruiting to his staff. Woodham remained a leader writer for the paper until within nine months of his death.<br>
<br>Woodham was not the last <span class="italic">Times</span> journalist to combine academic and newspaper work, but he was decidedly one of the most idiosyncratic. He remained a fellow of Jesus until his marriage, on 28 November 1848, to Elizabeth Humfrey (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of Charles Humfrey, a banker, of Cambridge, and flatly refused to work in London or after 3 p.m. Delane was thus compelled to send up materials and suggestions for leading articles by the early train, while Woodham sent down his productions in the evening or on the next day. Like all Delane's writers he had to be ready to turn his hand to any subject, but perhaps it was not without point that the editor repeatedly set him to writing on railway accidents. Woodham wrote also on mesmerism, bank frauds, the income tax, pauper education, fire insurance, sewage, notable murders, and dozens of other topics. He had various specialisms: India, iron-clad ships (perhaps oddly for a clergyman), and foreign affairs, especially after Henry Reeve withdrew from the paper in 1855. He did not always give satisfaction to his employers. Mowbray Morris, the manager of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, thought that he often wrote like a pedagogue, and Delane occasionally complained of Woodham's refusal to vary his routine, even in emergencies. But most of the time the editor was glad to have so dependable and copious a writer on his staff. Woodham's annual salary was &pound;1200, and in return he wrote more than 200 articles a year, averaging 2000 words each. It is easy to see what Delane meant when he remarked in 1869 that &#145;Woodham is, as usual, writing all the paper himself&#146;  (Dasent, 2.244). Woodham's articles were less lively than his private letters: he took care to subdue himself to the <span class="italic">Times</span> style; but his contributions were marked by a good judgement and good humour, which were not always characteristic of the Thunderer's pronouncements. Among his most memorable achievements was his sympathetic article on Abraham Lincoln's death (published 29 April 1865). Another was a biography of the duke of Wellington, published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 15 and 16 September 1852 and issued in the same year, without the author's name, in book form. This biography has often been attributed to Samuel Phillips, and authorship of it appears to have been claimed by Henry Reeve. But it was almost certainly Woodham's work.<br>
<br>Woodham was a devoted Cambridge man, dismissing Oxford as &#145;that sink of port and prejudice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span> Archive, Delane MSS, 3/107). He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the regius chair of history. In university politics he was a conservative liberal. His wife's death in 1851 made his college his sole refuge: in 1862 he was elected an honorary fellow, and delighted in being the only man since Cranmer to have become a fellow of Jesus twice. His collegiate feeling extended to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He liked to lure Delane, Reeve, and (especially) Morris to Cambridge and to get them drunk in the combination room. He was something of a toper himself, and decidedly a gormandizer. Food is a recurring theme in his letters&#151;pheasants, mangoes, mutton, lobster at Hunstanton, and turtle soup at Bristol (&#145;rather too thick&#146;). When Delane mismanaged an invitation to the lord mayor's banquet, so that Woodham got neither drink nor food, he never heard the last of it. But for all that Woodham was a serious man and a wise friend, with considerable insight into human nature. He advised his colleagues on everything from Delane's coat of arms to Morris's troubles with his unsatisfactory son.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span> did not quite monopolize Woodham's energies. He was made LLD in 1849 and elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1856. He contributed frequently to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> between April 1848 and July 1850. He died at his home, 66 Hills Road, Cambridge, on 16 March 1875, and was buried beside his wife and mother at St Mary's Church, Reading.<br>
