<span class="headword">Gwynne, Sir  Rowland</span>  (<em>c.</em>1659&#150;1726), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of George Gwynne (<i>c</i>.1623&#150;1673) of Builth, Radnorshire, an MP under the protectorate and in the 1660 Convention, and his wife, Sybil, only child of Roderick Gwynne of Builth. He attended St John's College, Oxford, matriculating on 16 July 1674, and was entered at Gray's Inn in 1679. In 1681 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Having barely attained his majority, Gwynne was returned to the first Exclusion Parliament for Radnorshire, and, although a gentleman of the privy chamber and knighted by Charles II in 1680, threw himself with an almost desperate zeal into the cause of exclusion, with the result that in 1683 he went into voluntary exile in the Netherlands, suspected of complicity in the Rye House plot.<br>
<br>Gwynne had married Mary Bassett (<i>d</i>. 1722), daughter and heir of William Bassett of Glamorgan. However, having wasted his own considerable inheritance and his wife's fortune, he stood in need of a greater reward at the revolution than the minor place of treasurer of the chamber, which, aside from various local dignities, was all he received. In 1692 he forfeited even this office when a characteristic political gamble backfired. He laid an information before Queen Mary accusing the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Henry, Viscount Sidney (later earl of Romney), of corruption, but was unable to prove the charge. Deprived of royal favour and hounded from Radnorshire politics by his great rivals the Harleys, he sought out a new patron, Thomas Grey, second earl of Stamford, a new parliamentary seat (first for Brecknockshire and then as Stamford's nominee for Bere Alston), and a new reputation as an energetic House of Commons man.<br>
<br>It was Gwynne who in 1696 proposed the introduction of a loyal association, in response to revelations about the assassination plot, and who in 1698 led the inquiry into clandestine trade with France during the Nine Years' War. By 1701 he was serving as chairman of the influential elections committee, and was even talked of as a possible speaker. In politics he was a thoroughgoing whig, committed to the maintenance of the revolution settlement and the Hanoverian succession. Indeed, he was selected to carry up the <span class="roman">Bill of Settlement</span> to the Lords, and in 1702 piloted through parliament a measure to attaint the Pretender. He was thus a particular target for the tories, and according to his own account lost his seat at the 1702 election after a specific campaign against him inspired by the tory leaders. Harassed by creditors and pressed by the Treasury to render his long overdue chamber accounts, he fled to Hanover, where he attempted to ingratiate himself with the electoral family.<br>
<br>In 1706 Gwynne blundered badly once more in permitting his name to be subscribed to a paper written by the philosopher Leibniz in support of moves in England to invite over the Hanoverian heir presumptive to the throne, which was published in the form of an open letter to Lord Stamford. The effect was to alienate both Queen Anne and the Electress Sophia. Gwynne retired to Hamburg, a sad and lonely figure, &#145;rusting for want of the conversation I was used to&#146;  (Gwynne to Robert Harley, 9 Dec 1710, BL, Add. MS 70229), until Queen Anne's death opened the way for him to return to England. Although he sailed over with King George, as some twenty-five years previously he had accompanied the prince of Orange on his voyage to claim the crown, he received only an annuity of &pound;400 from the new monarch, was soon deep in debt again, and ended his days in a debtors' prison.<br>
<br>Mary Gwynne died in 1722, four years before her husband. The couple left no children, and at Sir Rowland Gwynne's death her entailed estate returned to her family. Gwynne himself was able to bequeath only plate and household goods, and to request in his will to be buried under a &#145;plain black stone&#146; with a simple inscription recording his Christian belief  (PROB 11/607, fols. 46<i>v</i>&#150;47<i>r</i>). Gwynne died &#145;in the rules of the King's Bench&#146; on 24 January 1726.<br>
