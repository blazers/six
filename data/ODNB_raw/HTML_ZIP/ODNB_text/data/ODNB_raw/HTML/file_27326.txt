<span class="headword">Thomson,  Thomas</span>  (1817&#150;1878), <span class="occ">botanist and geologist</span>, was born in Glasgow on 4 December 1817, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27325/', "Thomas Thomson (1773&#150;1852)")</script>, professor of chemistry at Glasgow University, and his wife, Agnes Colquhoun (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of a distiller near Stirling. Thomas was educated at Glasgow high school and Glasgow University. When only seventeen he published a well-regarded paper on his discovery of fossil marine mollusca on the Firth of Clyde. Intending initially to adopt chemistry as a profession, Thomson studied inorganic chemistry in the university laboratory under his father, and spent the summer of 1837 at Giessen under J. von Liebig, when he discovered pectic acid in carrots. However, on entering medical classes at Glasgow University, he concentrated his attention on botany, under Sir William Jackson Hooker.<br>
<br>On 21 December 1839, having graduated MD, Thomson entered the service of the East India Company as an assistant surgeon. Subsequent promotions were to surgeon (1 December 1853) and surgeon-major (21 December 1859). On his arrival in Calcutta early in 1840 he was appointed curator of the Asiatic Society's museum, but in August he was sent to Afghanistan in charge of a party of European recruits. He reached Kabul in June 1841, and proceeded to Ghazni, where he was attached to the 27th native infantry. There he began a botanical and geological study of the area, but was besieged during the winter of 1841&#150;2 and was taken prisoner when the town fell in March 1842. He was destined to be sold into slavery in Bukhara, but, together with some fellow prisoners, bribed his captor to convey him to the British army of relief.<br>
<br>Thomson returned to India having lost all his specimen collections and personal effects, and from 19 June 1843 until 1845 was stationed at Moradabad where he acted as civil surgeon. Following service through the Sutlej campaign of the first Anglo-Sikh War he was stationed at Moradabad, Lahore, and Ferozepore. During this period he investigated the botany of the plains and outer Himalayas. In June 1847 he was appointed one of the British commissioners for defining the boundary between Kashmir and Chinese Tibet. Having reached Leh in October the commissioners split up, Thomson subsequently making extensive explorations in the Kashmir territories, going as far north as the Karakoram Pass, and obtaining important geographical information and specimen collections. On his return to Ferozepore he suffered repeated attacks of malaria and took furlough at Simla, where he made further botanical researches. He published an account of his explorations in his <span class="italic">Western Himalaya and Tibet</span> (1852), a well-received though prosaic work.<br>
<br>In early 1850 Thomson joined his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker in Darjeeling, and from May 1850 undertook fieldwork with him in the Sikkim forests, Assam, and Chittagong, finally returning to England in bad health in March 1851. The next few years were spent at Kew, laboriously working on the extensive collections made during these travels. In the mistaken belief that financial assistance would be given by the East India Company, he and Hooker brought out the first volume of their <span class="italic">Flora Indica</span> (1855), the publication of which was subsidized by a legacy from Thomson's father. However, the sole support obtained from the company was an offer to purchase 100 copies. No more volumes appeared, Thomson withdrawing from a plan to resume publication in 1870, following an argument with Hooker.<br>
<br>At Bath, in early 1855, Thomson married Catharine, daughter of R. C. Sconce of Malta. Thomson then proceeded immediately to Calcutta where he was installed as superintendent of the botanical garden in April. He was also appointed professor of botany at the Calcutta medical college, and held the two posts until 1861, when he retired and returned to England in ill health. He lived first at Kew and then at Maidstone and retired officially from the medical service in September 1863. In October 1871 he returned to India as treasurer and translator to the expedition under Sir Norman Lockyer sent out to observe the solar eclipse on 12 December 1871. He died at his home, 16 Horbury Crescent, Notting Hill, London, from &#145;malignant disease&#146; on 18 April 1878 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife; they had no children.<br>
<br>Thomson was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1852, of the Royal Geographical Society in 1854, and of the Royal Society in 1855. He was for twelve years an examiner in natural science for the medical services of the army and navy, and on several occasions examiner in botany for the University of London and the Royal School of Mines.<br>
