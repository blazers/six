<span class="headword">Mozley,  John Kenneth</span>  (1883&#150;1946), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 8 January 1883 at Horsforth, Leeds, the third son of John Rickards Mozley (1840&#150;1931), former fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and an inspector of workhouse schools under the Local Government Board, and his wife, Edith Merivale, daughter of Bonamy Price. Mozley obtained a scholarship at Malvern College (1896&#150;1898), but after a serious illness was moved to Leeds grammar school. He proceeded to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1902, where he was a scholar.<br>
<br>Mozley's career in the university was distinguished. He was president of the union, and was placed in the second division of the first class in part one of the classical tripos (1905) and the first class in part two of the theological tripos (1906). He gained the George Williams (1906) and Norrisian (1909) prizes and the Crosse (1906) and Allen (1907) scholarships. He was ordained deacon in 1909 and priest in 1910 and from 1907 until 1919 was a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, of which he became dean in 1909. In 1910 he married Mary Geraldine (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of the Revd John William Nutt, fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and rector of Harpsden, Henley-on-Thames. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1920 Mozley left Cambridge to take up the office of principal of Leeds Clergy School, where he remained until 1925 when the school was closed for lack of funds. He then moved to a similar post as warden of St Augustine's House, Reading. From 1920 until 1930 he was lecturer of Leeds parish church, a position he regarded highly and to which he returned in the last year of his life.<br>
<br>Mozley was a Liberal in politics, but, on the whole, a conservative in ecclesiastical affairs. He represented an intelligent and well-informed Anglican orthodoxy, but at the same time he was deeply influenced by the writings of the Revd Dr Peter Taylor Forsyth, the Congregationalist.<br>
<br>Mozley was seen by some contemporaries as one of the leading figures in the theological world of his generation. He was an important member of the archbishops' commission on Christian doctrine and one of his most learned books, <span class="italic">The Impassibility of God</span> (1926), was the outcome of research undertaken for that commission. Among his writings his first published work, <span class="italic">Ritschlianism</span> (1909), was a penetrating account of an influential theological movement. <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Atonement</span> (1915) is perhaps the best example of Mozley's power of exposition and the clearest statement of his fundamental convictions. But Mozley's most significant contribution was perhaps his ability to write simply and to interest many among the lay population in theological issues. He wrote a series of popular articles on religious matters for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. A contemporary said of him that &#145;though he was a scholarly theologian and churchman he had nothing of the &#147;highbrow&#148; or ecclesiastic about him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1946, 7). A good example of his more popular published work is <span class="italic">The Beginnings of Christian Theology</span> (1931).<br>
<br>The reputation built by Mozley's writings led to his being made a canon of St Paul's in 1930 and chancellor of the cathedral in 1931, playing a role in running the cathedral as well as presenting regular sermons which were both theological and evangelistic in tone. From 1937 to 1944 he was preacher of Lincoln's Inn. In 1941 Mozley felt compelled to resign his canonry because of his poor health, exacerbated by the strain of life in St Paul's during the night bombing of the City, and also the shock of the sudden death of his wife in that year, which was a consequence of the strain of continuous air raids. After his retirement Mozley continued to promote theological study, working particularly with women who were reading for the Lambeth diploma. He died at Merivale, Oak Road, Headingley, Leeds, on 23 November 1946, and was buried at Paddington new cemetery, Mill Hill, London, on 27 November.<br>
