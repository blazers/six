<span class="headword">Lovell,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1778), <span class="occ">sculptor and interior decorator</span>, was active from the mid-1740s. Nothing is known of his birth, parentage, or childhood. His work shows stylistic affinities with that of Peter Scheemakers&#151;who like Lovell worked at Stowe in Buckinghamshire&#151;and it seems likely that he trained in the studio of Scheemakers and Laurent Delvaux. Although the account books at Stowe refer to two sons, John and James Lovell, nothing is known either of Lovell's marriage. He apparently went bankrupt in 1768. Given the slight biographical knowledge of Lovell, an account of his life therefore must focus almost entirely on the evidence of his works.<br>
<br>Lovell worked mainly on houses and estates in Warwickshire: Radway Grange and the neighbouring Hagley Hall, Arbury Hall, Warwick Shire Hall, and Newnham Paddox. Many sources suggest that&#151;despite his large practice in this county&#151;he lived in London for most of his life. In 1756 Bishop Richard Pococke noted in the garden at Radway Grange a statue of Caractacus in chains, &#145;modeled &hellip; by a countryman of genius now established in London&#146;  (L. Dickens and M. Stanton, eds., <span class="italic">An Eighteenth-Century Correspondence</span>, 1910, 270); Horace Walpole supplies a more precise address when he refers to him as a &#145;statuary in Mortimer Street, near Oxford Road&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.644). An account presented by Lovell to Lord Temple's steward in 1775 provides a different, later address, revealing that the sculptor had rented a house in Wall Street, London, for the previous three years from his patron; this rental is again mentioned in a final settlement of his account for work at Stowe, dated 10 October 1777, and it may be presumed to be the place of his death the following year.<br>
<br>Lovell's works may be divided into three categories: plasterwork and fittings for interiors of the early Gothic revival; funerary monuments for church interiors; and neo-classical monumental statuary in relief and in the round, mostly to be found at Stowe. He was a stylistic chameleon throughout his career, and early neo-Gothic and rococo elements persist until the final decade, when he executed the architectural and figurative sculpture of the south front of Stowe in the most advanced neo-classical taste. Stylistic variations may be attributed to the tastes of his patrons rather than to personal convictions. First and chief among these seems to have been Sanderson Miller of Radway: at the centre of the early Gothic revival, he was designer of plasterwork at his own Radway Grange, at Sir Roger Newdigate's Arbury Hall, at Lord Dacre's Belhus in Essex, and at Lord North's Wroxton Abbey in Oxfordshire, as well as at the house and church at Hagley in Worcestershire belonging to Lord Lyttleton. Through Lord Lyttleton, Miller was also involved in continuing restorations to the house and garden buildings at Stowe in Buckinghamshire. James Lovell was employed at all of these estates.<br>
<br>Lovell's principal funerary monuments are to Earl Fitzwalter in Chelmsford Cathedral and to the Montagu family at Horton church, Northamptonshire (both 1756). Horace Walpole admired the latter particularly, writing to Richard Montagu that &#145;There is a helmet that would tempt one to enlist&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.200). It was probably therefore through Walpole's intervention that Lovell sculpted the monument to Galfridus Mann in the church at Linton in Kent (1756), to the designs of Richard Bentley. Although a small monument, it was important as one of the earliest funerary monuments in the early Gothic revival style. Also in Kent is Lovell's monument to General Wolfe in his birthplace, Westerham (1760). Finally, there is the monument to Thomas Trotman in the church at Bucknell, Oxfordshire (1777).<br>
<br>Such occasional commissions for fireplaces, plasterwork, and funerary monuments would have made James Lovell an exemplary jobbing sculptor and stuccoist of the period but nothing more. What distinguishes him is the ensemble of relief and free-standing sculpture of the south front of Stowe, monumental in scale and marking a new departure in style. Executed in the final decade of his life, it was the culmination of a series of involvements by Lovell in the interior of the house and in the ornamentation of the garden buildings. The most conspicuous of these was the architectural ornament of the Corinthian arch framing the new south front and designed&#151;as the south front was&#151;by Lord Temple's nephew, Thomas Pitt, later Lord Camelford. The architectural ornamentation and the sculpture and stucco-work of the south front of Stowe made pioneering use of newly published sources: Robert Wood's <span class="italic">The Ruins of Palmyra</span> (1753) and <span class="italic">The Ruins of Baalbek</span> (1757), and the first volume of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> (1762). This is the earliest and most comprehensive programme of sculpture of the age of neo-classicism.<br>
<br>There is clearly no argument to be made for originality in design on behalf of James Lovell: he was a master craftsman and not an artist. His most impressive early sculpture was the chimney-piece in the saloon of Hagley Hall in Worcestershire for Lord Lyttleton in 1759, and it is decidedly rococo in style. But his major work is the most public manifestation of the transition from the rococo to the neo-classical style in sculpture, and his own career marks the end of the predominance of foreign sculptors in England and the coming-of-age of native sculptors.<br>
