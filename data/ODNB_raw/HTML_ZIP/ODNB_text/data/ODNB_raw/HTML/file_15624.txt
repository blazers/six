<span class="headword">Kingsmill family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1480&#150;1698), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, had before the last decades of the fifteenth century developed interests principally in Berkshire. They acted as bailiffs of Basingstoke, Hampshire, and established a residence at Barkham, some 12 miles away. Their situation began to change when Richard Kingsmill (<i>d</i>. 1511) married Amy, daughter of Richard Ingpen of Longparish, Hampshire. In 1501 he received Katherine of Aragon and her entourage on their way to her marriage with Prince Arthur. More important he worked hard to get his son <a name="cosubject_75325"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1509)<span class="occ"></span> a good start in life. John attended Winchester College from 1470 to 1474 and went on to New College, Oxford, in the latter year. He was a full fellow of New College from 1476 to 1479. Between 1487 and 1489 he provided legal counsel to Magdalen College, Oxford. The Middle Temple admitted him in 1489. From 1492 to 1504 he served as steward of Winchester College. Returned to parliament for Heytesbury, Wiltshire, in 1491, he became a JP for Hampshire in 1493, a position he retained until his death, and in the same year began to try cases in the court of requests. By 1494 he was a bencher of the Middle Temple and on 12 November 1495 he became a serjeant-at-law. In 1497 he became a king's serjeant. By 1499 he had gained a national reputation for his &#145;authority and worship&#146; as a fine but expensive lawyer. Henry VII appointed him a justice of common pleas on 2 July 1504, and chief justice for Lancaster on 9 January 1507.<br>
<br>Richard Kingsmill established another important connection for his son by arranging his marriage with Jane, daughter of John Gifford of Ichell, Hampshire, under a contract of 10 August 1490. While the Giffords were not among the most prominent of Hampshire's gentry, they occupied a more prestigious position than the Kingsmills, and John Gifford rightly saw John [i] Kingsmill as a young man of potential. John Kingsmill's marriage to Jane Gifford produced four children: John; Alice, who married Thomas Bullock of Arborfield, Berkshire; Mary, who married Richard Waller of Oldstoke, Hampshire; and Morpheta, a nun who became prioress and then abbess of Wherwell Abbey, Hampshire. Their father died on 11 May 1509, having lived long enough to leave his family with good local and national connections.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75326"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [ii] Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1497&#150;1556)<span class="occ"></span> maintained the upward social momentum established by his father, whom he followed into a legal career. He entered Lincoln's Inn in October 1516 and was called to the bar on 9 May 1521. It was also in 1521 that he took the momentous step of marrying Constance (<i>d</i>. 1580/81), the daughter of John Goring of Burton, Sussex, and the sister of William Goring. Although the Gorings were only a modest family of Sussex gentry, the connection had important long-term results. First, another Goring daughter, Anne, married Richard Gifford, strengthening the Kingsmill&#150;Gifford family alliance. Second, the Gorings were early protestants, and the influence of Constance and Anne helped bring both the Kingsmill and Gifford families into the reforming movement. Third, William Goring became an ally of Thomas Cromwell and helped to introduce his Kingsmill brother-in-law into that important political connection by the early 1530s. Fourth, by 1537 Kingsmill acquired the manor of Litchfield from the Gorings, his first substantial property in Hampshire.<br>
<br>By 1530 John Kingsmill's career was starting to blossom. Knighted in that year by Henry VIII, he became steward of Mottisfont Priory in Hampshire. In 1533 he became involved in local government, serving as commissioner to inquire about wastes committed in various forests. He was appointed a JP in 1537, continuing to hold that office until his death, and served as sheriff of Hampshire in 1538&#150;9 and 1543&#150;4. During the late 1530s he worked closely with Cromwell's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Thomas Wriothesley, and both men greatly benefited from the dissolution of the monasteries. Kingsmill's acquisitions included the manors of Sandford and Woodcott and also, in 1540, the rich manor of Sidmonton, which replaced Barkham as the family's principal residence.<br>
<br>During 1539 Kingsmill worked hard as sheriff to assure the election of Cromwell's candidates as Hampshire's representatives in parliament. As a result he earned the enmity of the conservative Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester. Nevertheless after the fall of Cromwell in 1540 Kingsmill remained active in local government and was sheriff again in 1543&#150;4. Under Edward VI he was a commissioner for the dissolution of chantries in 1548. Queen Mary pardoned him for offences committed prior to 1 October 1553, and thereafter he was inactive in local government and politics.<br>
<br>Sir John [ii] Kingsmill left a large, successful, and staunchly protestant family when he died on 11 August 1556, although the significance of his legacy was not immediately apparent in the unfavourable atmosphere of the Marian restoration of Catholicism. During summer 1558 Hampshire experienced its only burning of a heretic, a gentleman named Thomas Bembridge, who happened to be a relative of both Anne Gifford and Constance Kingsmill. Bembridge recanted at the first attempt to burn him and his relatives illegally saved him from the fire. The privy council ordered a second and successful execution shortly afterwards, which created lasting bitterness among the Kingsmills and Giffords, especially toward the sheriff, Sir Richard Pexsall.<br>
<br>Elizabeth I's accession immediately revived the Kingsmills' prospects and her reign can largely be considered the zenith of the family's fortunes. Sir John and Constance Kingsmill had seventeen children. Their eldest son, and heir, <a name="cosubject_75327"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [i] Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1526&#150;1593)<span class="occ"></span>, is not recorded as attending any university or inn of court. On 17 January 1553 his father had contracted for William's marriage to Bridget, the daughter of Simon Ralegh of Farnborough, Warwickshire. A JP for Hampshire from 1558 he remained in that office until shortly before his death. He was appointed sheriff of the county in 1563, and in 1564 Bishop Robert Horne of Winchester identified him as a favourer of protestantism. He was knighted in 1569, and in that year supported Horne in a dispute with religious conservatives over local office-holding. He was also active in local musters and enforcing laws against recusants. In 1571 he added to the family estates by purchasing Malshanger and Wootton manors. He died on 10 November 1593.<br>
<br>The other Kingsmills of Sir William's generation also did well for themselves and were determined supporters of the protestant religion. The second son, <a name="cosubject_75329"></a><span class="headword">Richard Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1528&#150;1600)<span class="occ"></span>, followed the family tradition of a legal career and became more prominent politically than his older brother. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 June 1543 he was called to the bar in 1548. In 1555 Sir John Thynne recommended him for a position in Princess Elizabeth's household. He served Lincoln's Inn as a reader in 1558, 1559, 1566, and 1567; as treasurer in 1563; and as governor in 1568. A Hampshire JP from 1558 until his death, he was elected MP for Calne, Wiltshire, in 1559 and for Heytesbury, Wiltshire, in 1563. Appointed a commissioner for the establishment of true religion in the north of England in 1559, he was also identified as a favourer of the protestant religion in 1564 by Bishop Horne. During the 1560s he attempted to use his protestant and family connections to obtain the attorneyship of the court of wards, but did not succeed until 1573. He became surveyor of the court in 1590. Meanwhile in 1584 and 1586 he was elected a knight of the shire for Hampshire. He also built up his estate, acquiring the manors of Shoddesden, Hurstborne Fauconers, Tangley, Highclere, and Burghclere. He married Alice, the daughter of Richard Fauconer of Hurstborne, Hampshire, after 1557. Their daughter and heir, Constance, married Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, Warwickshire. Alice had died by about 1574, when her husband married Elizabeth Stonehouse (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodrofe). Richard Kingsmill's death on 24 September 1600 without a male heir resulted in the breaking up of his estate. He was buried at Highclere, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Sir John [ii] Kingsmill's other sons included Henry Kingsmill (<i>c</i>.1534&#150;1577), who studied civil law in Paris and Padua, and under Mary went into exile at Venice in the household of the earl of Bedford. By 1560 he was a member of the royal household and in 1563 sat in parliament for Downton, Wiltshire, through the patronage of Bishop Horne. A firm protestant in the Genevan style, he died young. John [iii] Kingsmill (<i>c</i>.1536&#150;1590) was a member of Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1553 and MA in 1562. A fellow of Magdalen between 1556 and 1572, he became that college's bursar in 1563. At Oxford he displayed strongly protestant sympathies and opposed vestments. Appointed chancellor of Winchester diocese in 1570, he sat in parliament for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, in 1584 and 1586. During his last years he lived at the Magdalen College manor of King's Enham, where he died in 1590 apparently unmarried. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15622/', "Andrew Kingsmill (1537/8&#150;1569)")</script> studied civil law at Oxford but became more interested in Calvinist theology and biblical studies. He travelled to Geneva in 1566, became a minister there, and died at Lausanne leaving several devotional writings that were published posthumously. George Kingsmill (<i>c</i>.1539&#150;1606) began his legal studies at Lincoln's Inn in 1560 and was called to the bar in 1567. A highly regarded lawyer, who was made a queen's serjeant in 1595, in 1579 he purchased the stewardship of King's Somborne hundred which probably accounts for his election in 1584 and 1586 as MP for Stockbridge in that hundred. After 1595 he married Sarah, the widow of Francis, Lord Hastings. In 1599 George Kingsmill became a judge in the court of common pleas like his grandfather. Dying without children in April 1606, he left to his widow an estate which included lands inherited from his brother Richard. <a name="cosubject_15624"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Kingsmill</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1605?)<span class="occ"></span> was a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1558. A strong protestant, he and his brother John were disciplined on 2 May 1559 for expressing heretical views and for shaving their heads in mockery of the tonsure. Nevertheless he became a fellow of Magdalen in that year, and graduated BA on 27 November. Reader in natural philosophy 1563&#150;5 and public orator 1565&#150;9, he proceeded MA in 1564. In 1569 he resigned his fellowship and became the university's first regius professor of Hebrew on the recommendation of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. Unlike his immediate successors he was appointed for life, but mental illness blighted his career; in the words of Anthony Wood, he became &#145;distempered in brain with too much lucubration&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.758). In 1579 Richard Hooker began serving as his deputy, but Kingsmill later recovered and retained his chair until 1591. Whether he died in that year or later is unclear, as books by him were published in 1602 and 1605, the latter dedicated to James I.<br>
<br>Sir John and Constance Kingsmill also had five daughters, four of whom married well. The eldest daughter, Catherine, married Sir Richard Norton of Hampshire, so bringing the head of a hitherto strongly Catholic family into the protestant camp; Margaret married John Thornborough of Shotesden, Hampshire; Jane married John Cupper, whose premature death in 1566 furnished the inspiration for some of Andrew Kingsmill's devotional writing; Alice married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22269/', "James Pilkington (1520&#150;1576)")</script>, a Marian exile and the first protestant bishop of Durham&#151;a relationship which her brother Richard exploited to advance his career.<br>
<br>By the time Constance Kingsmill died, between April 1580 and June 1581, the fortunes of her late husband's family were starting to go into decline. Her sons Andrew and Henry had predeceased her; Thomas was insane, at least intermittently. Her eldest son Sir William [i] was not the man his father and grandfather had been, while the achievements of Richard, George, and John would be stillborn owing to their failure to produce male heirs. The fortunes of the Kingsmill family lay in the hands of her grandson William.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75328"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [ii] Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1557&#150;1618)<span class="occ"></span> showed himself a respected member of the magisterial gentry of Hampshire. Besides being a JP he served as sheriff of Hampshire in 1601&#150;2 and 1612&#150;13. He was knighted in 1606. He also maintained his family's long-standing political alliances, for instance by siding with Sir Henry Wallop, a kinsman through the Giffords, during a disputed parliamentary election for Hampshire in 1614. Before about 1588 he married Ann, the daughter of William Wilks of Hadnell, Warwickshire, and the widow of Anthony Dryden. His marriage, like that of his parents and grandparents, was fertile, producing five sons and seven daughters, although not all survived to adulthood. But unlike most of his forebears Sir William was not long-lived, and unfortunately for the family neither were his son and his grandson. His heir, <a name="cosubject_75330"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1588&#150;1624)<span class="occ"></span>, was his father's eldest surviving son, though his second by birth. In 1610 he married the formidable Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of John White of Hampshire. Knighted in 1611, Sir Henry died prematurely in 1624, leaving as his son and heir the eleven-year-old <a name="cosubject_75331"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [iii] Kingsmill</span>  (1613&#150;1661)<span class="occ"></span>. Bridget inherited two thirds of her husband's estates and also purchased the wardship of her son. The latter attained his majority in 1634, but because his mother outlived him he never gained full control of the Kingsmill lands.<br>
<br>The relationship between mother and son was sometimes stormy. Even stormier was the political situation of England in 1640 when William [iii] Kingsmill first became a JP in Hampshire. Charles I appointed him sheriff of Hampshire at Reading about November 1642, but the parliamentary general Sir William Waller removed him from that office during October 1643. The king also knighted him, possibly on his appointment as sheriff and no later than October 1644. Although Sir William was a thoroughgoing royalist in his sentiments he never fought against parliament, and Charles I did not particularly trust him. In his actions as opposed to his words Kingsmill appears to have been a neutralist. His estates suffered during the civil war as there was considerable military activity in northern Hampshire. He had submitted to the local parliamentary committee for compounding by 1645, and from 1646 to 1650 was again a JP for Hampshire. He may have participated in royalist plotting during 1649 or 1650, after the king's execution, but thereafter he lived in outward quiet and acceptance of the regimes of the Commonwealth and protectorate. Privately he produced poetry that was deeply critical of the political situation. On 21 February 1654, at the comparatively late age of forty-one, he married Ann, daughter of Sir Anthony Haslewood. They had a son and two daughters, Bridget and Anne.<br>
<br>Sir William died on 3 September 1661 leaving as his heir the six-year-old <a name="cosubject_75332"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [iv] Kingsmill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1655&#150;1698)<span class="occ"></span>, who from 1664 was raised by his uncle Sir William Haslewood. William Kingsmill was knighted in 1680. His relationship with his former guardian clearly deteriorated badly, for on 3 November 1683 he killed his uncle after a quarrel in which, Kingsmill claimed, Haslewood gave him great provocation and drew his sword on him. He was pardoned the manslaughter on 14 June 1684, in spite of the opposition of the dead man's family. He was married twice, first to Frances Calwell, with whom he had four children, including his heir, another William, and second to a woman named Rebecca, who bore him two daughters. He died on 26 November 1698. His son and heir William [v] Kingsmill (1685&#150;1766) never married and suffered from insanity during the last thirty years of his life. The family's lands and arms passed by act of parliament in 1766 to the Brice family, who also adopted the Kingsmill name.<br>
