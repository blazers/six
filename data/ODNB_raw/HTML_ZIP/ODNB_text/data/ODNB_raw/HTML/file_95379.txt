<span class="headword">Bambatha ka Mancinza</span>  (1865/6&#150;1906), <span class="occ">chief and rebel in Natal</span>, was born in 1865 or 1866 in the Umvoti division of the British colony of Natal. He was the son of the chief Mancinza (also called Sobhuza) ka Jangeni (<i>d</i>. 1883) and a daughter of the Chunu chief Phakade who was hence called Maphakade. He succeeded to the chieftaincy of the Ngome branch of the Zondi tribe under the regency of his uncle Magwababa in 1890 and in his own right in 1896. He was unhappily married and appeared repeatedly in court, mainly for debt, but occasionally for crimes. Because of his assault on several men in a faction fight in August 1905 the Natal government decided to remove him as chief in February 1906. Later in February some of his men took up arms to oppose collection of the colony's poll tax. Although Bambatha dissuaded them he failed to report the incident to the authorities.<br>
<br>In March 1906 Bambatha was summoned to appear before the minister for native affairs. Instead he fled to Zululand. Arriving at the Osuthu kraal with a pregnant wife and three children, he went to Dinizulu, chief of the Suthu and son and heir of the later Zulu king Cetshwayo. Although the British government refused to recognize Dinizulu, most Zulu regarded him as their king. Later, when on trial for high treason, Dinizulu claimed that Bambatha was not expected, and that Bambatha had complained of harassment for debt at home, and asked to live in the king's district. Dinizulu also stated that he had sent Bambatha home. According to Bambatha's wife and children, Bambatha was brought by one of Dinizulu's men to the Osuthu, where Dinizulu gave him a rifle and told him to go back to Natal and start a rebellion. It is impossible to reconcile the two accounts.<br>
<br>Natal was agitated by the government's imposition of a &pound;1 tax on adult males (with a few categorical exemptions), which became payable in January 1906. Dinizulu denied rumours that he was behind a movement to overthrow European rule, and he had his own people pay the tax promptly. Bambatha, on the other hand, brandishing the rifle which he said Dinizulu had given him, launched his rebellion on 2 April 1906, seizing Magwababa, whom the government had again appointed regent. The magistrate who went to investigate was driven off on 3 April and police who went to the magistrate's rescue were ambushed on 4 April. Initially the rebellion appeared to be a success, for the police lost four killed and left the battlefield. No rebel was killed, seeming proof of Bambatha's claims to be able to doctor men against bullets. Yet Bambatha was disappointed when other chiefs did not join him as expected. Nor did he have the full support of his own people. At most he attracted (or commandeered) 300 armed supporters. Little was said about the poll tax; most who were liable had already paid. Bambatha was motivated largely by revenge. He wanted to kill Magwababa, but one of Dinizulu's men prevented him.<br>
<br>On 7 April 1906, when colonial forces closed in, Bambatha fled to Zululand with about a hundred men. He was received by the aged Chube chief Sigananda, who also had personal reasons for rebelling. Together they conjured with Dinizulu's name and drew recruits from neighbouring tribes until, by the third week of April, the rebel army numbered about a thousand men. They waited for Dinizulu to join them, but he disavowed them, sending a trusted adviser to deliver the message. The rebels' explanation for this rejection was that because of government pressure Dinizulu could only support them secretly.<br>
<br>The rebels lacked overall command. They had no commissary. They trusted in a defensive strategy in the rugged Nkandhla division. On 5 May they were worsted in an encounter with the police at Bobe ridge. Bambatha's men stayed in the bush and did not attack, while Sigananda's attacked in the open and were mowed down by rifle fire. Morale fell. Bambatha now appeared to be a coward and a quack. For a fortnight he was hardly seen, and it was said that he was sick. He again sought out Dinizulu in an attempt to get support, but Dinizulu declined. Rebel reinforcements from the Nqutu division arrived under an important Zulu chief, Mehlokazulu. Early in June the rebels threatened to invade Natal, but were diverted by a call for help from Sigananda, whose people were suffering greatly from militia actions. The relieving force was intercepted by militia at the mouth of the Mome gorge on the morning of 10 June and was destroyed. Mehlokazulu was primarily to blame, not heeding forewarnings of the ambush. Sigananda surrendered on 16 June and the rebellion in Zululand collapsed. A flare-up in the Mapumulo division of Natal was suppressed early in July.<br>
<br>There are two different contemporary accounts of Bambatha's death. A few days after the battle at Mome a body in the gorge was identified as his, its head cut off and brought up to the militia camp, closely guarded, and shown to persons who knew what Bambatha looked like and would identify it as his. Then it was taken back and buried with the body. Officially it was proclaimed that Bambatha was dead. Yet stories began to circulate almost immediately that Bambatha had escaped, and during the next eighteen months, while Zululand was in an unsettled state, he was often reported at various places, preparing to renew the fight. Dinizulu's loyalty came into question when Bambatha's wife and children fled from the Osuthu and alleged his complicity in the rebellion. In December 1907 Dinizulu was arrested, then charged, and finally put on trial for high treason in November 1908. After Dinizulu's arrest reports about Bambatha ceased. Indeed they had no substance, for those who made them had never actually seen or spoken to Bambatha. The last eyewitness report of him dates from the day of the battle. Nor is there any circumstantial evidence that he exerted a direct influence on events after that time. It is most likely that Bambatha died in the Mome gorge, on 10 June 1906, though in recent years stories have circulated again that Bambatha escaped and, after the rebellion, lived incognito in Zululand or Mozambique.<br>
<br>Bambatha's significance consists in his being a symbol of resistance, and his rebellion has been called the first act in the twentieth-century struggle for liberation from colonialism and apartheid in South Africa. Bambatha seems to have had no agenda in rebelling except a personal one, and he was not a charismatic leader. In Natal he was manipulated by one of Dinizulu's men, and in Zululand he became a cipher among the rebel leaders. His rebellion brought hardship and death first to his own people, and then to others elsewhere. Today's icon is the product of the romanticization of a lost cause.<br>
