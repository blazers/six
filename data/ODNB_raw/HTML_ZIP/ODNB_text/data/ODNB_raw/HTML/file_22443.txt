<span class="headword">Pole,  Arthur</span>  (1531/2&#150;1570?), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22447/', "Sir Geoffrey Pole (d. 1558)")</script> of Lordington, Sussex, and Constance (<i>d</i>. in or after 1570), eldest daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Packenham of Sussex. Geoffrey Pole was the youngest son of Sir Richard Pole, cousin of the half-blood to Henry VII, and Margaret Pole, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Plantagenet, countess of Salisbury, daughter of George, duke of Clarence, the senior brother of Edward IV. Arthur was probably brought up at Lordington; Gentian Hervet of Orl&eacute;ans, who had studied with Erasmus and was a pupil of Thomas Lupset, was appointed his tutor. As grandson of the countess of Salisbury, one of the wealthiest peers in England, his future looked favourable. However, the Pole family's loyalty to the Catholic faith led to their fall in 1538, and the countess and her eldest son, Henry, Lord Montague, were executed in 1541 and 1538 respectively. Geoffrey Pole, whose evidence had been used to condemn his family, suffered a mental breakdown and fled from England without licence in 1548. At some point Arthur was imprisoned, but by December 1552 he had been taken into the service of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland.<br>
<br>At the accession of Queen Mary, Geoffrey Pole and his brother Reginald, who was appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 1556, returned to England. Possibly as a result of Geoffrey's role in his family's fall and Arthur's period of service with Northumberland, they did not enjoy any particular favour during Mary's reign. After Reginald's death Arthur complained that relations between him and his uncle had been strained and he had not received any bequests in his will. Following Elizabeth's accession Arthur Pole wrote offering to serve her, but his offer was not accepted and in April 1561 he was imprisoned in the Fleet for hearing the mass. Among others imprisoned was Pole's close friend Edward Hastings, Lord Loughborough. Connected to Pole by marriage, Loughborough was the brother of Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon, the husband of Catherine Pole, eldest daughter of Henry, Lord Montague. According to Alvaro de Quadra, the Spanish ambassador, Loughborough treated Pole as his son and allowed him to reside in his house, probably at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. Pole also enjoyed a connection with Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland, and at some point before September 1562 had married Northumberland's sister.<br>
<br>In September 1562 Quadra reported that the third earl of Huntingdon was among those named as a possible successor to Elizabeth I. Huntingdon was the great-great-grandson of the duke of Clarence, twice in the female line, while Pole was the great-grandson once in the female line. It was possibly this that prompted Quadra to assert that, although Pole's &#145;claim is not worth much&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 259, no. 184), he was one degree nearer the crown than Huntingdon. This, along with his loyalty to the Catholic faith and lack of prospects under Elizabeth, prompted Pole to plot to leave the realm and enter the service of either Spain or France. Informed that the duke of Guise would never support his claim to the throne in preference to that of Mary, queen of Scots, Pole hoped to receive the dukedom of Clarence should he help Mary gain the English throne. There was even a rumour that the duke of Guise intended to marry Pole to Mary.<br>
<br>Actively supporting Pole in these schemes was his brother-in-law Anthony Fortescue, who was married to Arthur's eldest sister, Catherine. Fortescue had been comptroller of Reginald Pole's household, and his family had enjoyed an association with the Pole family for many years. In July 1562 Fortescue had approached Quadra asking for letters of recommendation to the duchess of Parma, and by September Pole had sent word to Quadra, again asking for a letter of recommendation and help to leave England. Described by Quadra as &#145;turbulent and not very prudent, but spirited and daring&#146;, he nevertheless felt that if Pole &#145;obtained important support he could be very troublesome&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 259, no. 184). At the same time Fortescue approached the French ambassador who, like Quadra, refused to help them while they remained in England.<br>
<br>In light of the succession issue the English authorities took a serious view of such plots, and in October 1562 Pole, his brothers Edmund and Geoffrey, and Fortescue were arrested as they prepared to take ship to France. Geoffrey and Fortescue were eventually released but Arthur and Edmund remained in the Tower until their deaths, probably in 1570; both are omitted from their mother's will that year, which describes Thomas as her eldest son. Both brothers carved inscriptions at the Tower. The Salt Tower contains their names, while in the Beauchamp Tower, Arthur's inscription reads: &#145;Deo Servire / Penitentiam Inire / Fato Obedire / Regnare Est / A Poole / 1564 / IHS&#146; (&#145;To be subject to God, to enter upon penance, to be obedient to fate, is to reign, A Poole, 1564, Jesus&#146;). A further inscription was recorded by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments in the 1930s: &#145;IHS/a passage perillus maketh a port pleasant/ Ao 1568, Arthur Poole, Ao sue 37&#146;.<br>
