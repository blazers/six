<span class="headword">Ellis,  Roger Henry</span>  (1910&#150;1998), <span class="occ">archivist</span>, was born on 9 June 1910 at Garsdale, Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, eldest of the four children of Francis Henry Ellis (1882&#150;1953), managing director and chairman of the Sherwood Colliery Company, and his wife, Sybil Mary (1881/1882&#150;1969), daughter of Adrian Roger Chicken of Nottingham. From Sedbergh School (1923&#150;9) he went to King's College, Cambridge (1929&#150;33), where he took firsts in both parts of the classical tripos and was awarded an Augustus Austen Leigh studentship. After a brief spell of research on Greek vase painting, and in default of any vacancies in a gallery or museum, he joined the staff of the Public Record Office on 1 January 1934. He soon absorbed the scholarly traditions of the office and became a disciple of Hilary Jenkinson, the most dynamic of the assistant keepers and a major influence on his subsequent professional career. His interest in seals and in conservation arose at this time.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1939 Ellis married Audrey Honor (1912&#150;1993), only daughter of Herbert Arthur Baker of London and Tilford, Surrey. They had two daughters. War interrupted his career: he enlisted as a private in 1939 and rose to captain in the 5th fusiliers. In May 1944 he was assigned to the monuments, fine arts, and archives sub-commission of the Allied Control Commission, where Jenkinson was archives adviser. From May to November 1944 he visited and reported on Italian archives in the wake of the allied advance, incidentally developing an enduring love of Italy. In November he was transferred to the German sector and promoted major.<br>
<br>Ellis returned to the Public Record Office in 1945, and was soon involved in the post-war expansion of archival work, notably the establishment of an intermediate repository for non-current records, for which he appropriated the term &#145;limbo&#146;. He was one of the first lecturers (1947&#150;57) on the diploma course in archive administration at University College, London, and also taught document repair at the London School of Printing. In technical matters he was a pioneer, stressing that the first duty of the archivist was to preserve records, and only secondarily to make them available for study. He formulated five principles of archive repair which have remained basic despite changes in materials and techniques. He was later chairman of the British Standards Institution committee that drafted BS 5454, <span class="italic">Recommendations for the Storage and Exhibition of Archival Documents</span> (1977). His close involvement with the British Records Association also dated from this period; he was the founder editor (1947&#150;57) of its journal <span class="italic">Archives</span>.<br>
<br>In 1957 Ellis became the first full-time secretary of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, established in 1869 to report on non-governmental records. During his fifteen years as secretary he transformed its role and widened the scope of its activities and influence, laying a solid foundation for subsequent developments. His first priorities were to move the commission out of the Public Record Office into separate offices in Chancery Lane and to secure a revised and extended royal warrant. Its publications were both pruned and expanded. The expensive calendars were gradually discontinued but new series were inaugurated: the papers of nineteenth-century prime ministers and joint publications with local record-publishing societies. The revised warrant ensured the permanence of the National Register of Archives, whose importance as a tool for historical research had become clear by 1957. During his secretaryship its scope and use increased greatly, and a first step was taken to computerize its indexes.<br>
<br>Ellis had for some time been concerned about the probable loss of the working papers of British scientists. A joint committee of the commission and the Royal Society (1966) resulted in a published guide, <span class="italic">The Manuscript Papers of British Scientists, 1600&#150;1940</span>, and the establishment of the Contemporary Scientific Archives Centre in Oxford, though slow progress meant that both postdated his secretaryship.<br>
<br>The commission's centenary exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in 1969 allowed Ellis to combine a succinct and entertaining history with a wide selection of documents illustrated by appropriate portraits and artefacts, drawing on his own interests and knowledge.<br>
<br>Ellis retired in 1972 but soon returned to the Public Record Office to catalogue medieval seals. Between 1978 and 1986 three illustrated volumes of a seal catalogue were published. After his wife's death in 1993 he began cataloguing the Fuller collection of seals in the University of London Library, and was still engaged in this at his death. Retirement afforded him time for travel and his many other interests. He diffidently published two slim volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Ode on St Crispin's Day</span> (1979) and <span class="italic">Walking Backwards</span> (1986).<br>
<br>Ellis was a distinctive figure, tall, debonair, with expressive eyebrows and no time for pomposity. His precision of mind was matched by his elegant handwriting and literary style. He came across as an amused and tolerant observer of men&#151;and of himself. His visual sense was strong; as well as the fine arts, he derived pleasure from fine printing and binding, the pattern of poetry on a page, the bounty of the garden in autumn. He lovingly tended his collections of furniture, silver, paintings, books, and the family archives in his beautiful Hampstead house. A long-time member of the Athenaeum and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, he epitomized the connoisseur. Strong beliefs and high standards informed everything he did. His writings, mostly in professional journals, give an inadequate idea of the wise and quiet influence he exerted in the development of archive services after the war. He died at home at 7 Straffan Lodge, 1 Belsize Grove, London, on 19 March 1998 of heart failure and was cremated at Golders Green on 26 March.<br>
