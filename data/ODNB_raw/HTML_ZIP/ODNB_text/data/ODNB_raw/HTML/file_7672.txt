<span class="headword">Dilly,  Edward</span>  (1732&#150;1779), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born on 25 July 1732 at Southill, Bedfordshire, the second son of Thomas Dilly, a substantial yeoman farmer. According to James Boswell, the Dilly family had lived there for at least two centuries. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7673/', "John Dilly (1731&#150;1806)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7671/', "Dilly, Charles")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7671/', "Charles Dilly (1739&#150;1807)")</script>. Bound as an apprentice to the London bookseller John Oswald on 6 December 1748, he was freed by redemption on 11 June 1754. In the following year he succeeded to Oswald's shop at the sign of Rose and Crown at 22 Poultry near the Mansion House, which remained with the family until the 1800s. In 1756 he took on his younger brother Charles as an apprentice; in 1764 Charles joined him as a junior partner in the business. The firm's output was prodigious and varied, including religious, historical, medical, legal, philosophical, mathematical, and literary works; the Dillys also gained a notable reputation for promoting dissenting and &#145;American&#146; material. Nichols described Edward as &#145;a Bookseller of great eminence &hellip; particularly in the line of American exportation; and in the Writings of the good old School of Presbyterians&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.190). He maintained commercial interests in a number of newspapers including both the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> and the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>. He also was a generous and effective literary patron, supporting James Beattie and Elizabeth Montagu among others.<br>
<br>Edward was described by Charles as &#145;a good-natured and well-disposed man &hellip; the useful man in business&#146;, but lamented that he was &#145;dreadfully contaminated with false ideas in politics&#146;: &#145;to a stranger he must and does appear in a disagreeable point of view&#146;  (&#145;Letters to Josiah Quincy&#146;, 492). This obsession was underlined in an account of him by Elizabeth Fothergill: &#145;Politics is his constant theme, and he will force one's attention whether one will give it or not&#146;  (J. J. Abraham, <span class="italic">Lettsom; his Life, Times, Friends and Descendants</span>, 1933, 94). He was a loyal supporter of John Wilkes and fiercely pro-American, and even proved himself to be a fairly competent political writer. None the less, the brothers were famed for their wide and remarkably diverse social circle, which included many &#145;patriots&#146;, &#145;true whigs&#146;, and crypto-republicans as well as a number of their political opponents. Notable friends included John Wilkes, Catharine Macaulay, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Johnson (who first met Wilkes at a dinner party hosted by Edward), and James Oglethorpe, as well as clergymen and ministers from a wide variety of religious persuasions. Nichols underlined the brothers' trait of cheerful sociability when he famously observed that Edward was &#145;a man of great pleasantry of manners; and so fond of conversation, that he almost literally <i>talked himself to death</i>&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.191). Fothergill went further: Edward was &#145;one of the greatest talkers I ever met with, tongue, hands, and head all moving at a time with so much rapidity that I wonder how his lungs sustain it&#146;  (Abraham, <span class="italic">Lettsom</span>, 94).<br>
<br>The brothers, neither of whom married, lived upstairs from their shop in the Poultry; they also inhabited a country house near Hemel Hempstead, and were regular visitors to their native Southill. Edward's health declined from March 1778 and he died from consumption on 11 May 1779 at Southill, in whose churchyard he was buried. His will, dated 8 February 1779 and proved on 13 May 1780, named Charles as administrator and residuary legatee, and Charles continued the business until his own retirement.<br>
