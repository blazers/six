<span class="headword">Fitzalan,  Thomas</span>, fifth earl of Arundel and tenth earl of Surrey  (1381&#150;1415), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the second son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9535/', "Richard (III) Fitzalan, fourth earl of Arundel and ninth earl of Surrey")</script>, and Elizabeth de Bohun (<i>d</i>. 1385). On the execution and forfeiture of his father in 1397, the honour of Arundel was granted to John Holland, duke of Exeter, to whose custody the sixteen-year-old Thomas was committed. Treated as a servant and humiliated, he escaped to his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/713/', "Archbishop Thomas Arundel (d. 1414)")</script> in exile, both eventually joining the future Henry IV in Paris. They landed with him at Ravenspur, Yorkshire, on 24 June 1399 and accompanied his march to Bristol and Chester. Fitzalan was knighted on 11 October 1399 and, though under age, with the judgment on his father reversed, received livery of his inheritance in 1400. He assisted in repressing the rising of the earls at Epiphany 1400 and a French source (<span class="italic">Chronicque de la tra&iuml;son et mort de Richart Deux roy Dengleterre</span>) credits him with instigating the execution of his former captor, John Holland, at Pleshey. He later joined the royal expedition to Scotland and was elected a knight of the Garter.<br>
<br>In the fourteenth century the Fitzalans were second in wealth and influence among the marcher lords only to the Mortimer earls of March. The harsh exploitation of their lordships of Oswestry, Clun, Chirkland, and Bromfield and Yale produced an income of some &pound;2000 per annum and to this were added the Warenne lands in Sussex and elsewhere, giving a total income of over &pound;4000 per annum. Arundel's grandfather, Richard, had a treasure of not less than &pound;72,245 in 1376. On Richard (III) Fitzalan's forfeiture in 1397 all this moveable wealth was confiscated and dispersed while, in the revolt of Owain Glyn D&#373;r in 1400&#150;01, Arundel's lands were ravaged and many of his tenants, alienated by harsh landlordship, joined the rebels. For the next six years Arundel was fighting to reassert his own and the king's authority in north Wales. In July 1402 he was appointed king's lieutenant in the north, but the royal campaign of that year was a disaster, and following the battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, he was retained to guard the Welsh marches, having his headquarters at Oswestry. These years of arduous service on the Welsh march had brought him into close association with Prince Henry, the earl of Warwick, and other lords including Sir Thomas Beaufort. Called from Wales in June 1405 to suppress the Yorkshire rising of Mowbray, Bardolf, and Archbishop Scrope, he and Thomas Beaufort were hastily invested with authority as constable and marshal to pass judgment of execution on the archbishop as a traitor at Pontefract. The shocked protest of his uncle, Archbishop Arundel, marked the beginning of a deepening rift between them. The earl's marriage in November 1405 to Beatrice, the illegitimate daughter of Jo&atilde;o I of Portugal, was made on the urging of Henry IV who defrayed the cost, as a means of strengthening the alliance with Portugal where his sister was queen.<br>
<br>Over the next four years Arundel increasingly attached himself to Prince Henry, becoming his principal retainer in 1407, and distanced himself from the court where his uncle's influence prevailed. In Sussex he was confronted with the growing influence of Sir John Pelham, treasurer of England and a counsellor of Henry IV, who held the custody of the Mowbray castle of Bramber and the duchy of Lancaster castle at Pevensey, while further disputes with his uncle occurred over lands in Kent and Sussex. In May and again in November 1409 the council ordered him and other marcher lords to return to Wales, but when Prince Henry secured power in 1410 Arundel joined the council alongside Thomas Beaufort as chancellor. He now became closely involved in the implementation of the pro-Burgundian policy of the prince's party as civil war erupted in France. In response to advances by Duke John the Fearless he was appointed on 11 September 1411 to negotiate with him for military aid and a possible marriage for Prince Henry. With Duke John facing Armagnac pressure in Vermandois and Paris, Arundel led a force of his own and the prince's retainers to Arras in October, moving thence with the Burgundian army to Paris where they attacked the Armagnacs at St Cloud on 9 November and removed the threat to Paris. Well rewarded by the duke of Burgundy, they returned in January 1412.<br>
<br>With the dismissal of the prince's council in December 1410 Arundel had no further political or military role until Henry's accession as king. Then he was appointed constable of Dover and warden of the Cinque Ports and treasurer of England. For the latter he had no evident qualifications and he was the only member of an ancient comital family to hold the post. But he lent almost &pound;3000 to the crown and was an active member of the council, involved in the reform of royal finance and the preparations for relaunching the war up to 1415. Evidently he stood high in favour and influence with Henry V, yet this did not inhibit the king from a firm demonstration of royal authority at the centre of Arundel's lands in Shropshire. In the aftermath of Glyn D&#373;r's revolt Arundel's retainers, John Wele, captain of Oswestry, and Richard Lacon, captain of Clun, had restored the earl's authority with systematic harshness. Arundel's absence in England encouraged them to practise extortion and intimidation on their own account, thereby provoking resistance from the followers of Arundel's rival, John, Lord Talbot. Already in November 1413 Henry V had bound both lords by recognizances to keep the peace, and in the summer of 1414 he conducted a tour of the west midlands to suppress disorders. On 15 June Arundel's officers&#151;Lacon, Wele, and others&#151;were indicted at Shrewsbury for offences over the preceding years and Arundel was made to stand surety for them. Although they were eventually pardoned and Lord Talbot was dispatched to Ireland, Henry had shown himself determined to discipline magnate feuding. The settlement of disorder in Shropshire, as elsewhere, was facilitated by recruitment of troublemakers for the expedition to France. The earl himself led a retinue of 100 men-at-arms and 300 archers to the siege of Harfleur but was one of those who succumbed to dysentery there. His company went forward to Agincourt, but Arundel returned to England on 28 September. He had already drawn up a will before embarking, enfeoffing trustees in many of his lands, and granting all his moveable effects to his widow; on 10 October he dictated his testament at Arundel, where three days later he died on his birthday. In it he not only made provision for masses and pilgrimages for his soul and the construction of his tomb, but for payment of the wages of his servants and military retainers at Harfleur. He made a legacy to his bastard son but left no legitimate children and his heirs were his three sisters: Elizabeth, duchess of Norfolk, Joan, Lady Bergavenny, and Margaret, wife of Sir Rowland Lenthal. The castle and honour of Arundel descended to his cousin and heir male John (V) Fitzalan, Baron Maltravers (<i>d</i>. 1421), who was however prevented by John (V) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, his brother-in-law, from inheriting the title. Thomas Fitzalan was buried in the collegiate church at Arundel where his tomb and effigy, with those of his wife, remain.<br>
