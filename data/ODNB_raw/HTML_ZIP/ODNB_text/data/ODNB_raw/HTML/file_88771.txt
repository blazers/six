<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wynn, Sir  Watkin Williams</span>, fourth baronet  (1749&#150;1789), <span class="occ">patron of the arts and politician</span>, was born on 8 April 1749, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30155/', "Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, third baronet (1693?&#150;1749)")</script>, of Wynnstay, Denbighshire, and his second wife, Frances (1717/18&#150;1803), daughter of a Cheshire squire, George Shakerly of Holme. His father had married his much younger god-daughter at the express request of his first wife, with the evident motive of securing an heir. The younger Watkin was five months old when his father died in a hunting accident on 26 September 1749. He inherited a complex of estates in north Wales and the border counties, notably Wynnstay, Llanforda in Shropshire, Rhiwgoch in Merioneth, and Llwydiarth in Montgomeryshire.<br>
<br>Wynn was educated at Westminster School from about 1760 until 1766. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 9 May 1766, but left the university without a degree in 1768. He was created a DCL in 1771, presumably to honour his father's name. Wynn had already shown interest in music, drama, and painting. He joined the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club, which met weekly for singing, in 1768, and also that year commissioned the first of several portraits of himself or other members of his family from Joshua Reynolds. He indulged and developed his cultural interests on his grand tour, which lasted from May 1768 to February 1769, and cost him &pound;8643. With his companions Captain Edward Hamilton and Thomas Apperley (the latter perhaps acting as a tutor), and steward Samuel Sidebotham, he travelled via Paris and Switzerland to Florence, where in October he gave a lavish dinner for sixty in honour of the investiture of Sir Horace Mann as a knight of the Bath. The party proceeded to Rome, where Wynn commissioned two paintings, one a group portrait of his party, from Pompeo Batoni, and patronized other painters including Gavin Hamilton, Anton Raphael Mengs, and Thomas Jenkins. He joined William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire, in employing the antiquary James Byres of Tonley to show them the Roman remains at Tivoli, and commissioned an unexecuted design from Byres for the reconstruction of Wynnstay as &#145;a vast Italian palazzo that would dominate the Dee valley&#146;  (Ford, 436). The party moved on to Naples and then Venice. Throughout Wynn attended plays, operas, and concerts, and acquired pictures, sculptures, and music scores. This cultural experience set the tone for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1769, two months after his return, he married Lady Henrietta Somerset (1748&#150;1769), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74104/', "Charles Noel Somerset, the deceased fourth duke of Beaufort (1709&#150;1756)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26010/', "Somerset, Henry second duke of Beaufort")</script>]. Wynn had anticipated the wedding with the purchase of several expensive presents for his wife and family in Paris, and the commissioning of a rococo silver gilt toilet set in London from the royal goldsmith, Thomas Heming (eventually acquired by the National Museum of Wales in 1964). The promise these presents represented was broken by the death of his wife on 24 July 1769, after just over two months of marriage.<br>
<br>Wynn's coming-of-age party in April 1770 became the stuff of legend: 8700 tickets were issued, reportedly allowing over 15,000 people into the park at Wynnstay, and the celebration cost &pound;1621. The next year Wynn married again. His bride on 21 December 1771 was Charlotte Grenville (1754&#150;1832), daughter of the recently deceased former prime minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11489/', "George Grenville")</script>: but, although his wife was also a niece of William Pitt, earl of Chatham, these connections would prove to have little influence on Wynn's political conduct. They had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30150/', "Charles Watkin Williams Wynn")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30152/', "Sir Henry Watkin Williams Wynn")</script>, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Wynn now adopted an annual lifestyle that would accommodate his multifarious interests, staying in London for the social season and parliamentary session for the first half of the year (he became an MP in 1772), and withdrawing to Wynnstay for the late summer and autumn, often until Christmas. In 1771 he bought 20 St James's Square as his London home for &pound;18,500, and then spent &pound;30,000 in the next three years on constructing what was virtually a new building, the architects being Robert and James Adam. Throughout the 1770s and 1780s Wynn, with his love of drama, music, and the visual arts, was very much a part of the lively London cultural scene. All his life he was an ardent theatre-goer, as well as an actor in amateur theatricals. His London house had a music room, where he held musical breakfasts, and doubtless often played himself, for in 1773 alone he had 158 violoncello lessons. He also appeared as a steward at the annual music festival at St Paul's to benefit the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy during the 1770s. A Welsh dimension was another characteristic of Sir Watkin's London life, for although unable to speak Welsh he was proud of his heritage. He gave &pound;100 per year to the Welsh charity school in London, and in 1772 he became vice-president of the Society of Antient Britons, the first London Welsh society. He was an active member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, the principal social, philanthropic, and intellectual Welsh society in London, and was chosen to be its second chief president in 1775. Wynn's social position as a London virtuoso was recognized when he was elected to the Society of Dilettanti, with whom he was painted by Reynolds in 1777. From the late 1770s Wynn's musical activities assumed a larger share of his public life. He was second only to John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, on the committee for &#145;Antient Concerts&#146; for music more than twenty years old, and his devotion to Handel&#151;he collected prints and manuscripts of the composer's music, as well as giving his music prominence in the concerts he programmed&#151;anticipated that of George III in helping Handel to a predominant place in the musical canon.<br>
<br>Wynn's cultural activities were partly replicated during his summer sojourns at Wynnstay. In August and September 1771 he travelled with the painter Paul Sandby, Apperley, and other friends around north Wales, an expedition that suggests Wynn was one of the pioneers of the fashion for the appreciation of the picturesque in landscape. The journey resulted in Sandby's <span class="italic">Views in North Wales</span> (1776). Among the other painters Wynn patronized were his remote kinsman, the Denbighshire-born Richard Wilson, and the portraitist William Parry. Robert Adam built a theatre at Wynnstay, a venue for concerts and plays, which usually included an annual week of amateur dramatics in which Wynn took part. In 1777 it was graced by David Garrick. Wynn also engaged in customary country-house life. The Cycle of the White Rose, formerly a Jacobite organization headed by his father, now became a social club for the local gentry, and he also established a Freemasons' Lodge at Wynnstay. A member of the Jockey Club, Wynn supported race meetings in his home area of the Welsh borders. The Wynnstay hunt was founded in 1768, but Wynn's lack of enthusiasm for that traditional country sport was shown by his first economy, the sale of his hunting horses and hounds in 1781.<br>
<br>This sale indicated that the background to Wynn's extravagant lifestyle was one of growing financial stringency. He was never quite as wealthy as contemporaries thought. His income in 1749 has been variously estimated at between &pound;12,000 and &pound;20,000, and though it was &pound;27,000 by 1778 his debts were rising. Between 1773 and 1781 alone he borrowed &pound;65,000, and the Wynnstay debt at his death was &pound;160,000, with an annual interest burden of &pound;6000. Wynn was not entirely to blame. His mother's annual &pound;2000 jointure had by his death cost the estate &pound;80,000, and his father had left a large debt. However, Wynn's lavish subsidy of so much London culture and his famous Wynnstay hospitality were the constant despair of his agents. Additionally, there were the costly obligations of politics.<br>
<br>Wynn had inherited with Wynnstay implicit political commitments: to retain the Denbighshire seat in the Commons for his family, and to maintain the powerful electoral interest his father had built up in north Wales. According to a radical newspaper, the <span class="italic">London Evening Post</span>, Wynn developed an early interest in politics, so much so that in 1770 he was reputedly invited to stand as the radical candidate in a Westminster borough by-election  (<span class="italic">London Evening Post</span>, 27 Feb, 24 and 26 April 1770). Wynn would seem an improbable radical, but he was keen to enter parliament, and did so at a Shropshire by-election in 1772. At the general election of 1774 he transferred to Denbighshire, retaining that seat for life; there is no record of any speech by him during his seventeen years as an MP. In 1774 Wynn spent &pound;4600 in a vain attempt to defend the Montgomeryshire seat of his cousin Watkin Williams against a candidate sponsored by the rival Herbert family interest of Powis Castle. The quarrel spilled over into Merioneth, where Wynn helped his ally Evan Vaughan to retain his seat against another Powis Castle candidate. Wynn's further active part in a Caernarvonshire contest made the 1774 election an expensive experience for him and one he did not intend to repeat. He had, in fact, successfully defended his family's influence; Powis Castle's fears of another costly contest enabled him to recover control of Montgomeryshire at the next election, and he helped Watkin Williams to take the Flint Boroughs seat in 1777.<br>
<br>In parliament Wynn had sided with the opposition to Lord North's ministry, but he nevertheless applied, through North, for the lord lieutenancy of Merioneth when it fell vacant in 1775. George III gave grudging consent: &#145;if he means to be grateful, otherwise favours granted to persons in opposition is not very political&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.74, 205&#150;7). For the next few years Wynn was a government back-bencher, but at the end of 1778 he was second only to Thomas, seventh Viscount Bulkeley, in organizing protests of the Welsh gentry against a Treasury warrant to investigate the diminution of crown revenues in Wales. The real motive behind this storm of protest at an alleged attack on liberty and property was the fear that an investigation would reveal illicit encroachments on crown lands by Welsh squires. The inquiry was blocked, but the episode coincided with growing unease about royal influence, and Wynn moved back to opposition. He took a special interest in the campaign to curb government patronage, and Edmund Burke consulted him in 1780 about Welsh aspects of his proposed legislation. Wynn voted against North until his fall in 1782. He missed the critical session of 1783&#150;4 when the Pitt ministry was formed, and the anticipation on both sides was that he would support Pitt rather than Charles James Fox: for Earl Temple, so instrumental in Pitt's elevation, was his brother-in-law, and Pitt his wife's cousin. Wynn confounded expectations, and voted steadily against Pitt until his death. His political affiliation did not preclude his collaboration with George III in the Handel commemoration of 1784, where political factionalism gave way to a shared cultural enthusiasm among the &eacute;lite. From 1785 George III subscribed to the Antient Concerts, which became known as the King's Concerts, and although they were ended through the political estrangement of the directors from the king this did not occur until after Wynn's death.<br>
<br>Although of robust appearance and a cheerful disposition, Wynn suffered poor health for much of his life, being often stricken with erysipelas, then known as St Anthony's Fire, a dangerous disease akin to scarlet fever. He died, after a recurrence, on 29 July 1789, at his home, 20 St James's Square, Westminster. He was buried at Ruabon, Denbighshire. The obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> extolled his character rather than his achievements. &#145;He did not enter into the vices or the follies of his age &hellip; In his public and private capacity his disinterested integrity was unimpeachable &hellip; it belonged to Sir Watkin to be the more beloved the better he was known&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 59, 1789, 765).<br>
