<span class="headword">Stackhouse,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1742, <em>d.</em> 1819), <span class="occ">botanist and classical scholar</span>, was born at Trehane, Probus, Cornwall, and baptized at St Erme on 15 March 1742, the second son of William Stackhouse DD (<i>d</i>. 1771), rector of St Erme, Cornwall, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams; he was a nephew of the theologian Thomas Stackhouse (1680?&#150;1752). Stackhouse matriculated on 20 June 1758 from Exeter College, Oxford, but appears not to have graduated. He was a fellow of the college from 1761 to 1764. He resigned his fellowship on succeeding (27 May 1763) his cousin Mrs Grace Percival, sister of Sir William Pendarves and last in direct line, to the Pendarves estates, near Camborne, and, after travelling abroad for about three years, settled into Pendarves. On 20 April 1773 he married Susannah (1753&#150;1833), only daughter and heir of Edward Acton of Acton Scott, Shropshire. Of their four sons and three daughters, the eldest son (John) died at age seven; the second, Edward William, eventually MP, took the additional surnames Wynne and Pendarves (1815); and the third, Thomas Pendarves, succeeded to Acton Scott and after his mother's death took the additional surname of Acton.<br>
<br>With an adequate income, Stackhouse was able to develop his early interest in botany, especially seaweeds and, inspired by his classical background, those plants referred to by Theophrastus. In pursuit of seaweed interests, about 1775 he built Acton Castle, named for his wife, and close to the coast at Stackhouse Cove, Mount's Bay. This building, his &#145;Marine Box&#146;, included basement tanks, in which Stackhouse was the first known worker to grow marine algae from spores. There, as Stackhouse told Turner, the &#145;rocks at low water have many curious <i>Fuci</i>&#146;. In his investigations, Stackhouse relied on his own field observations; the herbaria of Dillenius, Bobart, and Linnaeus; and work by colleagues such as T. J. Woodward, Dawson Turner, Samuel Goodenough (bishop of Carlisle from 1808), Lilly Wigg, John Pitchford, and Colonel Thomas Velley. The prime significance in seaweed terms of Stackhouse's work is that he was &#145;the first to break away completely from the custom of recognizing only the Linnean genera of algae&#146;  (Papenfuss, &#145;Classification&#146;, 116). He eventually (1795&#150;1801; 1809; 1816) divided the British species of the Linnaean <i>Fucus</i> into sixty-seven genera, some red, some brown, and some lichenized, of &#145;algae&#146;. This complex task was inevitably incomplete then and the results are now largely (but not wholly) superseded. Few copies of Stackhouse's main works <span class="italic">Nereis Britannica</span>, <span class="italic">Illustrationes Theophrasti</span>, and his edition of <span class="italic">Theophrasti Eresii de historia plantarum libri decem</span> have survived; this is unsurprising since sales of the second and third fasciculi of the <span class="italic">Nereis</span>, his principal text on seaweeds, were poor, partly due to the Napoleonic wars. (However, being his own artist, he broke even.) The <span class="italic">Nereis</span> was published as a first edition in three fasciculi (1795&#150;1801) at Bath; the mode of publication made the pagination complex and the plates equally so. A folio work, its make-up and variation between known copies, including the presence or absence of Stackhouse's portrait, are well described by Henrey (1975). The text, in both Latin and English, differs from that of the later (1816) second edition which, in smaller format and in Latin only, also contains additional new genera. Between these, Stackhouse produced his &#145;Tentamen marino-cryptogamicum&#146;; although dated from Bath, 1807, this appeared in the second volume (1809, 50&#150;97) of <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale des Naturalistes de Moscou</span>. Stackhouse was a fellow of the Moscow Society and as early as 1795 of the Linnean Society. Two other papers appeared in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span>, volumes three (1797) and five (1800).<br>
<br>Stackhouse's more classically influenced botany appeared in <span class="italic">Illustrationes Theophrasti</span> (1811) and his two-volume edition of <span class="italic">Theophrasti Eresii de historia plantarum libri decem</span> (1813&#150;14). He later extracted the Theophrastan text on frankincense, myrrh, and balsam from the latter, added notes, text, and Latin translation of the Greek (overall as <span class="italic">De libanoto, smyrna, et balsamo, Theophrasti notitiae</span>, published 1814), and produced a prefatory pamphlet to accompany the 1814 text, under the title <span class="italic">Extracts from Bruce's travels in Abyssinia, and other modern authorities, respecting the balsam and myrrh trees</span> (1815). Catalogues of the plants mentioned by Theophrastus appear with the 1811 and 1813&#150;14 works by Stackhouse. There is disagreement among some modern authors on the acceptability of Stackhouse's treatments of Theophrastus and his botany.<br>
<br>Stackhouse also published in the <span class="italic">Classical Journal</span>, and contributed to Alberto Fortis's <span class="italic">Dei cataclismi sofferti dal nostro pianeta, saggio poetico</span> (1786), Coxe's <span class="italic">Literary Life and Select Works of Benjamin Stillingfleet</span> (1811), Withering's <span class="italic">An Arrangement of British Plants</span> (1796 and 1801), and Dawson Turner's <span class="italic">Fuci</span> (1807&#150;19). In 1804, already much afflicted by gout, he resigned the Pendarves estate to his eldest surviving son, Edward William, and retired to Bath where, increasingly weakened by his condition even after good years, and &#145;keeping from the air in bad weather &amp; discontinuing totally Malt liquors, &amp; in a g<sup>t</sup> degree, wine&#146;  (Stackhouse to Dawson Turner, 13 April 1809), he died at his house in Edgar Buildings on 22 November 1819. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Weston, Bath; his wife, Susannah, who died on 31 December 1833, and his sister Mary, who died on 26 September 1829, aged ninety, were later buried alongside him. A monument to him, erected in 1820 by his widow, is in Camborne church, Cornwall.<br>
