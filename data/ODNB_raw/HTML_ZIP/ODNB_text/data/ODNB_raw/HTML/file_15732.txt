<span class="headword">Knight,  Mary Ann</span>  (1776&#150;1851), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born on 7 September 1776 in Birchin Lane, Cornhill, London, and was baptized on 28 October 1776 in the parish church of St Michael Cornhill, the daughter of John Knight, merchant, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodcock. In order to provide financial assistance to her parents, who later became impoverished, Mary Ann began to receive commissions to paint miniature portraits in 1802, at the age of twenty-six, and continued to paint until 1836. She had been a pupil of the miniaturist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22382/', "Andrew Plimer")</script>, who had married her sister, (Joanna) Louisa in 1801, and later she was to spend much time in the Plimer household, and painted several portraits of her nieces and nephews.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Andrew and Nathaniel Plimer</span> (1903) George Williamson included an account of Mary Ann Knight together with a list of her works &#145;extracted from her own note-books&#146;, then in the possession of Plimer family descendants  (Williamson, 73). He noted that &#145;She kept a very careful account of her earnings, and records that she made the sum of &pound;5,171 9s. 8d. being an average of 150 guineas a year throughout the above period&#146;  (ibid., 74). At first she charged between 2 and 4 guineas a portrait; by the end of 1805 she received 9 guineas for a larger- and 7 guineas for a smaller-sized portrait. About 1815 her success at portrait painting is indicated by her fees of between 20 and 30 guineas. She was particularly in demand for portraits of children, her success with whom Williamson attributed to &#145;her own engaging charm, quiet soft voice, merry vivacious manner, and great kindliness of disposition&#146;  (ibid., 77). She told her young sitters many stories and &#145;was able to represent them as real children, and to capture in her rapid and sketchy portraits excellent likenesses&#146;  (ibid.). While not immune to the custom of painting children as angels or in classical costume her most successful portraits of children are naturally posed. Williamson noted that Miss Knight sometimes copied the style of Anthony Stewart, a noted painter of portraits of babies. The fee of &pound;42 that she received for a group portrait of the children of Sir William Rush in 1814 was identical with that which she obtained in 1821 for a picture entitled <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span>. When she ceased work in 1836 she recorded having painted a total of 696 portraits. Her own list appears to be incomplete, however. Of the thirty portraits she exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1803 and 1830 some do not appear on her own list; in 1805 she exhibited at the academy a portrait, <span class="italic">Captain Norton Teyoninhakarlawen, a chief of the Mohawks, one of the Five Nations in Upper Canada</span>. One of her signed miniatures, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, is also of interest for the lock of hair intricately plaited in a sheaf design enclosed on the reverse.<br>
<br>Miss Knight lived at St John's Wood and at Wicken, Stony Stratford, the address of her parents. In 1813 her studio was in Old Bond Street, London. In old age she lived at Grove End Road, St John's Wood, London, where she died, unmarried, in 1851 at the age of seventy-five.<br>
<br>Of her miniatures Williamson noted that &#145;The finest work I have seen by Mary Ann Knight is at Oxford in the University Galleries; it might at first glance be attributed to Andrew Plimer so much does it resemble his work&#146;  (Williamson, 76). The miniature, of a young girl (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1820; AM Oxf.), is well painted and has subsequently been attributed both to Miss Knight and to Andrew Plimer. While her miniatures are generally of &#145;a large size&#146; and &#145;pale, even washy in colour&#146; she occasionally used a rich colour scheme and was &#145;very partial to the use of a rich purple, resembling the bloom of a grape&#146;  (ibid., 77). Her miniatures of members of the Manners family are reproduced in Williamson  (facing p. 76).<br>
<br>Apart from her miniatures Williamson drew attention to Mary Ann Knight's &#145;rough sketches made in a wash of sepia &hellip; in which she coloured the faces with the very faintest wash of carmine&#146;  (Williamson, 78). One of these was of the dramatist and poet Joanna Baillie. While Miss Baillie would not allow the portrait to be engraved, as she did not want to see it &#145;all over the place&#146;  (ibid., 75), a copy was taken and either this or the original is now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, together with another of the socialist and philanthropist Robert Owen (1771&#150;1858). The original of the Baillie portrait was included in a large sketchbook, subsequently in the possession of Plimer family descendants, containing a variety of &#145;first sketches&#146; in pencil and watercolour. These also included portraits of the writer Lucy Aikin (or Aitken); Lady Caroline Lamb and Anne Isabella, Lady Byron (both City of Nottingham Museums, Newstead Abbey collection); the artist's mother, Mrs Knight  (ibid., facing p. 74); Andrew Plimer's daughters; and a self-portrait. A chalk and watercolour drawing of Prince Hoare by Miss Knight after a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence is in the British Museum. According to Williamson &#145;these portraits deserve much more attention&#146;  (ibid., 79). The whereabouts of many of these sketches remains unknown.<br>
