<span class="headword">Birnie, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1760&#150;1832), <span class="occ">police magistrate</span>, was a native of Banff, Scotland. After serving his apprenticeship to a saddler he went to London, where he found work in the Haymarket with Macintosh &amp; Co., saddlers and harness makers to the royal family. Having on one occasion been called upon by chance to attend the prince of Wales, he did his work so satisfactorily that on subsequent occasions the prince used to ask that the &#145;young Scotchman&#146; might be sent to him. The patronage of the prince secured his advancement with the firm, and he was made foreman and eventually a partner. Through his marriage with the daughter of a wealthy baker of Oxenford Street, London, he also obtained a considerable fortune, including a cottage with adjoining land at Acton, Middlesex.<br>
<br>After his marriage Birnie rented a house in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and immediately began to distinguish himself by his activity in parochial affairs, serving successively, as he himself said, &#145;every parochial office except that of watchman and beadle&#146;. In 1805 he was appointed churchwarden, and, along with his colleague and the vicar, he established a number of almshouses for elderly parishioners in Pratt Street, Camden Town. He enrolled in the Royal Westminster volunteers, in which he became a captain. At the special request of the duke of Northumberland Birnie was placed in the commission of the peace for St Martin's parish and from this time he began to frequent the Bow Street police court, to familiarize himself with magisterial duties. In the absence of the stipendiary magistrates he sometimes presided on the bench, and with such efficiency that he was at length appointed police magistrate at Union Hall, from which he was a few years afterwards promoted to the Bow Street office, a position which he had long desired.<br>
<br>In February 1820 Birnie headed the police officers in the arrest of the Cato Street conspirators. In the absence of the soldiers (who failed, as they had been ordered, to turn out at a moment's notice), he took the responsibility of making an immediate attempt to capture the band, before they were fully prepared and armed. According to a contemporary account, he &#145;exposed himself everywhere, encouraging officers to do their duty, while the balls were whizzing about his head&#146;. He was greatly offended when Sir Robert Baker was appointed to the post of chief magistrate following the death of Sir Nathaniel Conant. In August 1821 at the funeral of Queen Caroline he took it upon himself to read the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span>, which Baker had thought unnecessary. His action found favour with the ministry and, when Baker resigned shortly afterwards, Birnie was appointed to succeed him and knighted. During his term of office he was held in high respect by the ministers in power and frequently consulted by them. He also retained throughout life the special favour of George IV. He died in Bow Street, London, on 29 April 1832 and was buried on 6 May in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was survived by his wife and a son and two daughters.<br>
