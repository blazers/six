<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Atkins,  (Alexander) Robert</span>  (1886&#150;1972), <span class="occ">actor and theatre director</span>, was born in Dulwich, London, on 10 August 1886, the son of Robert Atkins and his wife, Annie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans). He was educated privately and then studied at the Academy of Dramatic Art from 1905 to 1906. For professional purposes he shortened his name to Robert Atkins, and while at the Academy of Dramatic Art he made his first public appearance walking on in a student production of <span class="italic">Nero</span>. When he left in 1906 he won their highest award, the Bancroft gold medal. The academy had been founded by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and it was there that Tree saw Atkins playing Shylock in the trial scene of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> and engaged him to join his company at His Majesty's Theatre. He stayed there for three years, graduating from small to leading roles, then joined John Martin Harvey's company and in 1911 played the Public Prosecutor in the famous production of <span class="italic">The Only Way</span> at the Lyceum Theatre. He then joined Johnston Forbes-Robertson's company and in October 1915 went to the Old Vic playing leading roles.<br>
<br>In 1919, after army service, Atkins returned to the Old Vic as actor and director. There he played King Lear, Caliban, Richard III, and Sir Toby Belch; he also directed several productions, including <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>&#151;in its entirety at matin&eacute;es&#151;<span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span>, and <span class="italic">Trelawny of the Wells</span>. It was in <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span> that he made his final appearance with the company in 1925, playing James Telfer. He then entered into management of the New Theatre, formed the Forum Theatre Guild, and in 1927 was appointed director of the British Empire Shakespeare Society, and also took his own Shakespearian company to Egypt. He produced and played leading roles in practically every theatre in London and the provinces, notably the Shakespeare canon, and in 1932 played Napoleon and also produced John Drinkwater's adaptation of Signor Mussolini's play of that name, for which he was made <i>cavaliere</i> of the order of the Crown of Italy. When Mussolini led Italy into the war against Britain Robert, a patriot to his soul, was asked what he intended to do about the order. &#145;Send the bloody thing back&#146; he seethed, and promptly fitted the action to the word. He directed <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> with its stunning black and white costumes and decor. Jean Forbes-Robertson played Viola with &#145;the latent wistfulness of an evening in high summer&#146;, which would have appealed to Atkins, who was ever the romantic.<br>
<br>In 1933 Atkins embarked on his long and successful association with the open-air theatre in Regent's Park, playing Caliban, Sir Toby Belch, and Bottom. From then until 1943 he produced all the plays at that theatre, and in 1939 was appointed its director as well as its producer. At the height of the Second World War he also had built an Elizabethan platform in Southwark Park and staged <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> with Claire Luce in the lead. Seats cost from 6<i>d</i>. to 2<i>s</i>. He directed George Robey as Falstaff, with Lady Tree as Mistress Quickly in 1934, and <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> at the Palace Theatre in 1940. 1944 saw his appointment as director of productions at the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon. He produced sixteen plays there, resigning in 1945 and resuming his association with the open-air theatre, where he appeared and directed until 1960. In 1949 he was made CBE for services to the theatre. He played Sir Toby Belch in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> at the 1956 Baalbek Festival, when he was awarded the Lebanese order of the Cedar. In 1961 he joined the Old Vic company at the Edinburgh Festival in <span class="italic">Dr Faustus</span>, and continued his directing career until 1963. He first appeared on film in <span class="italic">Peg of Old Drury</span> in 1935, but although he made many other film and television appearances, it was the theatre that was closest to his heart.<br>
<br>As Atkins had helped to shape Shakespearian drama throughout his career, Shakespeare had helped to shape him. Certain of his greatest roles, Falstaff and Sir Toby Belch, were reflected in facets of his own personality, and the precision, the poetry, and the imagery, sacred and profane, of Shakespearian dialogue influenced every part of his private language. It was never possible to misunderstand what he meant. His turn of phrase, whether succinct or embellished, never missed its mark. To this day many of his ripostes continue to resound through the rehearsal rooms and hostelries used by later theatricals. When Colonel Fordham Flower, of Flower's Brewery and chairman of the board of Stratford Memorial Theatre, requested Robert's resignation, it drew from Robert a less than flattering reference to Flower's Bitter, which will live as long as brewers brew and actors drink. Everyone who worked with him recalled some <i>bon mot</i> originated by him.<br>
<br>Atkins was immensely loyal to his cast, his stage management, and staff, whom he re-engaged production after production. The male members he invariably addressed as &#145;old son&#146; and it was possible to tell minutely, by the tone and inflection he used, the status of the relationship. His production methods were basically traditional. He dressed his productions in Shakespearian style and favoured incidental music which reflected that feeling. In Regent's Park this was provided by Rosabel Watson and a small female ensemble from a tent on the side of the stage. They were always referred to by him as &#145;Rosabel and the girls&#146;, to whom he was, as he was to all ladies, invariably gallant. He appreciated good work at all levels of theatre, but did not suffer fools, or those not as devoted to their profession as he wished, gladly. In rehearsal he wore, or kept nearby, a grey trilby hat and in moments of great stress, or at any sign of inaudibility, one of his <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>, he would cast it to the ground with a cry of &#145;for Christ's sake&#146; and either kick it or jump upon it, depending on the space available. At the end of his working life he became hard of hearing and consequently the trilby took a hammering.<br>
<br>Atkins was a cigarette smoker during the day but a cigar man of an evening after rehearsals or performances were over. A gregarious man, when at Regent's Park his local was The Volunteer on Baker Street, convenient also for his home at Ivor Court, just around the corner. In the West End of London he had his own strapontin seat at the corner of the bar in Rules restaurant on Maiden Lane, and at both venues he held court. As actor and as director he enriched the theatre and in particular Shakespearian drama, and as a man he enriched life in general for all who were fortunate enough to bask in the warmth of his friendship. His first marriage, to Mary Sumner, with whom he had a son, was dissolved; he then married Ethel Davey. He died in Hackney Hospital, Hackney, London, on 10 February 1972.<br>
