<span class="headword">Whalley,  Thomas Sedgwick</span>  (1746&#150;1828), <span class="occ">poet and traveller</span>, was born at Cambridge, the third son of John Whalley DD (<i>d</i>. 1748), master of St Peter's College, Cambridge, regius professor of divinity in that university and one of the king's chaplains in ordinary, and his wife, Mary (1706/7&#150;1803), only child of Francis Squire, canon and chancellor of Wells Cathedral. He was educated at Ilminster School, Somerset, and admitted on 27 April 1763 to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1767 and MA in 1774. He was ordained about 1770. In March 1772 Edmund Keene, bishop of Ely, presented him to the rectory of Hagworthingham, near Spilsby in Lincolnshire, and, in consequence of its unhealthy situation in the fens, made it a condition that he should never enter into residence. This stipulation he readily complied with, and for the long period of more than fifty years the duties were discharged by a curate. About 1825 Whalley built a parsonage house for the benefice. He was appointed on 22 August 1777 to the prebendal stall of Combe (13) in Wells Cathedral, and retained it until 1826.<br>
<br>On 6 January 1774 at St Marylebone, Middlesex, Whalley married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1801), only child of Edward Jones of Langford Court in Burrington parish, Somerset, and widow of John Withers Sherwood. The marriage brought Whalley a great fortune and the estate at Langford Court where he resided for many years. About 1776 he purchased the centre house in the Crescent at Bath, and entertained with great hospitality both there and at Langford. He was a conspicuous figure in Lady Miller's circle at Batheaston, and wrote verses for her literary salon. Frances Burney described him as &#145;immensely tall, thin and handsome, but affected, delicate, and sentimentally pathetic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.314). In the summer of 1783, under the spur of economy, he and his wife broke up their establishments in England and went to Europe. Langford Court was let for many years and eventually sold in 1804. Whalley spent the spring and winter for a long period in southern France, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium, and kept journals of his continental experiences.<br>
<br>As a rule Whalley spent the summer at Mendip Lodge, formerly called Langford Cottage, on the Mendip hills, where the grounds were remarkable for their grottoes and terrace walks. Mrs Siddons often visited him there, and Hannah More was a neighbour. Whalley supported Hannah More's action over the school at Blagdon in an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">Animadversions on the Curate of Blagdon's Three Publications</span> (1802).<br>
<br>Whalley was created an honorary DD of Edinburgh University on 10 July 1808. Next winter he bought a house in Baker Street, London, and for some years lived there in great extravagance. His first wife had died on 8 December 1801, and in May 1803 he married a Miss Heathcote, a lady of good family and property in Wiltshire; she died at Southbroom, near Devizes, on 10 October 1805. On 3 October 1812 he married the widow of General Horneck (probably Charles Horneck who died at Bath on 8 April 1804). He soon discovered that she was heavily in debt, and they agreed to separate. She received from Whalley a comfortable settlement and a large house in Catharine Place, Bath, in which she gave grand parties.<br>
<br>Two volumes of Whalley's <span class="italic">Journals and Correspondence</span> were edited in 1863 by Revd Hill Wickham, rector of Horsington. Prefixed to the first volume is a print by Joseph Brown of Whalley's portrait by Reynolds. They contain many interesting letters from Hester Lynch Piozzi and Sarah Siddons, but are burdened with huge epistles from Anna Seward. Wilberforce described Whalley in 1813 as &#145;the true picture of a sensible, well-informed and educated, polished, old, well-beneficed, nobleman's and gentleman's house-frequenting, literary and chess-playing divine&#146;. Whalley was a patron of painting; the celebrated picture of <span class="italic">The Woodman</span> by Barker of Bath was painted for him, and, at his request, Sir Thomas Lawrence made an admirable crayon drawing of Cecilia Siddons, his goddaughter.<br>
<br>Whalley's writings include: <span class="italic">Edwy and Edilda</span> (1779), a poetic tale in five parts; <span class="italic">The Castle of Montval</span> (1781), a tragedy in five acts which was performed at Drury Lane in 1799 and &#145;tolerably well received&#146;  (D. Baker, <span class="italic">Biographica dramatica</span>, rev. I. Reed and S. Jones, 3 vols., 1812, 2.87); <span class="italic">The Fatal Kiss</span> (1781); and <span class="italic">Mont Blanc</span> (1788).<br>
<br>After the peace of 1814 Whalley went to Europe again. On his return in 1818 he purchased the centre house in Portland Place, Bath. In 1825 he bought the lease of a house at Clifton, and in 1828 he left England for the last time. A few weeks after his arrival at La Fl&egrave;che, France, he died there of old age on 3 September 1828. Although in his will he requested to be buried with his first two wives in a vault in Burrington church, he was buried in a Roman Catholic church in La Fl&egrave;che, a handsome sarcophagus of dark slate, with a Latin inscription, marking the spot.<br>
