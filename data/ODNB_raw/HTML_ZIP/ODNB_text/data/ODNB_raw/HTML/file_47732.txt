<span class="headword">Shirley, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1654), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the third son of Sir George Shirley (1559&#150;1622) of Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, and his wife, Francis (1564&#150;1594), daughter of Henry, Lord Berkeley of Berkeley, Gloucestershire. He married Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1596, <i>d</i>. after 1650), daughter of Thomas Harpur of Rushall, Staffordshire, about 1616; they had seven children. Shirley was knighted on 22 May 1622. His elder brother, Sir Henry Shirley, bt, inherited the family's main estate in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and Warwickshire and Sir Thomas was left with the family's manor of Botolph's Bridge in Huntingdonshire as his chief property. He mainly resided there and at the family's principal mansion at Staunton Harold, Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Shirley's main claim to fame was as a member of the circle of midland antiquarians associated with William Burton, William Dugdale, Sir Simon Archer, and Thomas Habington. He exchanged references with Archer and Burton, who visited him at Staunton Harold in the late 1620s; he collaborated with fellow Catholic Habington on his history of Worcestershire during the 1630s; and in May 1638 he joined with Dugdale, Sir Edward Dering, and Sir Christopher Hatton to form a group calling itself the Students of Antiquity who were dedicated to co-operative research in the London archives. Out of the researches of the midlands circle came a scheme for a series of county histories to match Burton's <span class="italic">Description of Leicestershire</span>, published in 1622. Shirley offered his services as historian of Warwickshire in 1631, but soon after decided to concentrate on the history of his own family and the work was assigned first to Archer, and then, later, to Dugdale. Shirley's &#145;Genealogicke history&#146;, which traced the achievements of his family from the time of their Anglo-Saxon ancestor, Sewale of Ettington, to his brother Sir Henry, was completed in the late 1630s, but never published. It also provided the material for the remarkable Shirley roll, a huge illuminated pedigree commissioned in 1632 which depicted the family's descent along with coloured drawings of deeds, armorial glass, and funeral monuments.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas's other principal work, a massive compendium entitled &#145;The Catholic armorist&#146;, combined his love of heraldry with his devotion to the Catholic religion. His parents were both dedicated Catholics and his wife's father was renowned for suffering for his faith during Elizabeth's reign. Thomas followed their examples. He remained a recusant throughout his life, enduring heavy financial penalties&#151;which led to the seizure and mortgaging of his manor at Botolph's Bridge&#151;and also a spell of imprisonment. This commitment was expressed in &#145;The Catholic armorist&#146; which took the form of a study of coats of arms into which he worked a defence of the Catholic faith and an account of the families that had remained loyal during the years of persecution. The work was finished about 1650, but was never published. It was apparently intended that it should circulate in manuscript among the families whose achievements Shirley recorded.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas spent part of the 1640s in exile in France, but had returned to Staunton Harold by 1653 and died the following year; he was buried in the church of St Peter Paul's Wharf, London, on 4 February 1654.<br>
