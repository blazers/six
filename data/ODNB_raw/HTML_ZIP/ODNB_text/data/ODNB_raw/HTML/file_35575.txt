<span class="headword">Pope, Sir  William Jackson</span>  (1870&#150;1939), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 31 March 1870 at 89 New North Road, London, the eldest of the eight children of William Pope, a City merchant who came from Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Alice, daughter of William Hall, of Prudhoe, Northumberland. He was educated at the Central Foundation School, London (1878&#150;85), the Finsbury Technical College (1885&#150;7), and the Central Institution (which became the Central Technical College while he was there), where he was a pupil of H. E. Armstrong. After having been successively assistant to Armstrong, working with Professor Frederick Stanley Kipping, head of the chemistry department of the Goldsmiths' Institute at New Cross (1897&#150;1901), and professor of chemistry in the municipal school and faculty of technology of the University of Manchester (1901&#150;8), he obtained the chair of chemistry at Cambridge University and was a professorial fellow of Sidney Sussex College until his death (1908&#150;39).<br>
<br>Although Pope's crystallographic studies leading to the announcement of the valency-volume theory (with William Barlow, 1906) and his investigations in general organic chemistry deserve attention, it is chiefly the advances which he made in stereochemistry, depending on the application of the principles of symmetry to molecular structure, which remain associated with his name.<br>
<br>When Pope began his stereochemical investigations the phenomenon of optical activity among naturally occurring organic compounds had been correlated with the asymmetry of their molecular structure, whereby enantiomorphism or mirror-image isomerism of the molecule results. This had come to be interpreted narrowly in terms of the presence in the molecule of at least one &#145;asymmetric&#146; carbon atom, around which four different univalent atoms or groups of atoms (radicals) are spatially arranged. It was also assumed that at least one carbon atom, in addition to the &#145;asymmetric&#146; one, must be present in the molecule of the compound exhibiting optical activity.<br>
<br>In 1897 Pope began his research by introducing improvements in the methods and new strong acids (derived from camphor) for the resolution of externally compensated compounds, chiefly organic bases, into their optically active isomerides. By his resolution (1899&#150;1902) of synthetic benzylphenylallyl-methylammonium iodide, methylethylthetine bromide, and methylphenylselenetine bromide, Pope demonstrated that a compound can exhibit optical activity which contains not an &#145;asymmetric&#146; carbon atom but another atom, nitrogen, sulphur, or selenium, which has an asymmetric environment. During the same period he also showed that the atom of tin may be an asymmetric centre, by obtaining methylethylpropylstannic iodide in an optically active form. The experimental proofs that atoms other than carbon could also be centres of asymmetry and give rise to optically active compounds constituted the greatest advance in stereochemistry since the work of Pasteur and the later work of J. H. van't Hoff and J. A. Le Bel.<br>
<br>Much later (1914), by his synthesis and resolution into its optically active forms of chloroiodomethane sulphonic acid, a compound containing only one, &#145;asymmetric&#146;, carbon atom, Pope established that a carbon atom attached to four different univalent atoms or radicals, none of which need contain a carbon atom, was sufficient to determine the possibility of a compound exhibiting optical isomerism.<br>
<br>Pope was the first to demonstrate (1908&#150;35) the basic principles on which depend the enantiomorphism and hence the optical activity of chemical compounds. By his resolution into its optically active isomerides of 1-methyl-<i>cyclo</i>hexylidene-4-acetic acid, Pope proved that a compound which does not contain an asymmetric atom but the molecular structure of which, as a whole, exhibits no element of symmetry, has a non-superposable mirror image and therefore can give rise to optical activity. No less remarkable was Pope's demonstration of the persistence of optical activity through a series of derivatives of the optically active parent compounds; some of these derivatives also had asymmetric molecular structures. Extending this work, Pope successfully investigated the synthesis and optical resolution of 1:1'-diamino-<i>cyclo</i>butane<i>spirocyclo</i>butane, which has an axis of twofold symmetry, and thereby established the mirror-image isomerism of molecules possessing certain elements of symmetry. This conclusion was emphasized by the results of the investigation of related substances. Pope had, therefore, established the broad principle concerning mirror-image isomerism, namely, that the molecular configuration may be &#145;dissymmetric&#146; and may possess any elements of geometrical symmetry excepting a centre of symmetry and a plane of direct symmetry, and that the molecular configuration of an optically active, or potentially optically active, compound need not be asymmetric or lacking geometrical symmetry.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Pope was a consultant to the board of invention and research. He worked on the preparation of photographic sensitizers, to extend the effectiveness of photographic plates, and elucidated the structure and preparation of the main sensitizer, pinacyanol. He also prepared mustard gas from ethylene and sulphur chloride, a process quicker than the German method. He studied the first organic compounds of gold and platinum, and also co-ordination compounds of the metals of groups I and VIII of the periodic table.<br>
<br>Among Pope's collaborators were Professor Kipping, W. H. Perkin, Stanley J. Peachey, A. H. D. Neville, C. S. Gibson, John Read, and F. G. Mann. The results of Pope's investigations appeared chiefly in the publications of the Chemical Society and the Royal Society, and in various French and German chemistry journals.<br>
<br>Pope occupied a leading position in chemistry and he received numerous honours, including several medals. He was president of the Chemical Society (1917&#150;19), of the Society of Chemical Industry (1920&#150;21), of the Union internationale de Chimie (1922&#150;5), and of the Solvay chemical conferences in Brussels (1922&#150;36). He was elected FRS in 1902 and was awarded the Davy medal in 1914. For his war services he was appointed KBE in 1919 and grand officer of the Belgian order of Leopold in 1937.<br>
<br>Pope, who did not marry, died at his home, Holmleigh, West Road, Cambridge, on 17 October 1939 after a long illness. With his death the professorship of chemistry in the University of Cambridge came to an end. In its place the chair of organic chemistry was established. During Pope's tenure of his chair and through his influence, the chairs of physical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, colloid science, and metallurgy within the department of chemistry in the University of Cambridge were established.<br>
