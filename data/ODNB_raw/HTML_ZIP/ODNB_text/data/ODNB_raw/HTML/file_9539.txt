<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzball <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ball]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1793&#150;1873), <span class="occ">playwright and writer</span>, was born at Burwell in Cambridgeshire and baptized there on 20 March 1793, the second son of Nathan Ball (<i>d</i>. 1803), a prosperous gentleman farmer with 500 acres of freehold land in Burwell, and grandson of Dr Robert Ball of Mildenhall in Suffolk. His mother, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1830), whose maiden name was Fitz, had previously been married to the Revd Brandish Marker of Bury St Edmunds, who died a year after his marriage and left a considerable fortune to his young widow. Edward Ball was educated at the Albertus Parr Academy in Newmarket. At the age of twelve, with his elder brother in the navy, he was forced to assist in the management of the indebted family estate, which had been much reduced by his father's propensity for gambling at the Newmarket races.<br>
<br>At the same age, the already theatrically smitten boy submitted his first play to the manager of the Bury St Edmunds Theatre, and returned to the farm in despair when it was rejected. In 1809, at the age of sixteen, Ball was articled to a printer in Norwich, coming out of his articles in 1812. After starting an abortive poetry magazine and marrying his wife Adelaide Alexandria Dupius (<i>d</i>. 1850) in Norwich on 15 August 1815, Ball was encouraged, particularly by the novelist Amelia Opie, to try his dramatic fortunes in London. Two tragedies, <span class="italic">Edwin</span> (1817) and <span class="italic">Bertha</span> (1819), and one melodrama, <span class="italic">The Ruffian Boy</span> (1819), had already been produced in Norwich. On his arrival in the metropolis Ball prudently secured employment as a printer. He then lived in Upper Stamford Street, off the Waterloo Road.<br>
<br>In 1821 Edward Ball changed his surname to Fitzball, conjoining his last name with his mother's maiden name, in order, he maintained, to avoid confusion with another songwriter named Ball. By that time he had a young daughter, Louisa, apparently his only child. Following the production at the Surrey Theatre of a melodrama, <span class="italic">Edda</span> (1820), and a pantomime, <span class="italic">Alonzo and Imogine</span> (1821), Fitzball had his first big hits at the Surrey with <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Nigel</span> (1822), an adaptation of Scott's novel, and <span class="italic">The Innkeeper of Abbeville</span> (1822), a domestic crime melodrama (first performed in Norwich), a subject in which Fitzball came to specialize with great success. The Scott adaptation was only one of a large number of theatrical versions of his novels, which for some years were enormously popular on the stage. Fitzball wrote further adaptations of Scott, including <span class="italic">Peveril of the Peak</span> (Surrey, 1823) and <span class="italic">Waverley</span> (Adelphi, 1824). After <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Nigel</span> and <span class="italic">The Innkeeper of Abbeville</span> came another successful melodrama, <span class="italic">Joan of Arc</span> (1822), which ran for 120 nights at Sadler's Wells and then transferred to the Olympic.<br>
<br>In the 1820s Fitzball also wrote in another dominant contemporary form of melodrama, the nautical. In this too he achieved immediate success with, at the Surrey, <span class="italic">The Floating Beacon</span> (1824) and <span class="italic">The Inchcape Bell</span> (1828)&#151;which combined Gothic with nautical material&#151;and, at the Adelphi, two adaptations of Fenimore Cooper novels, <span class="italic">The Pilot</span> (1825) and <span class="italic">The Red Rover</span> (1829). <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>, with the popular former sailor actor T. P. Cooke, was especially successful. Another Adelphi success was <span class="italic">The Flying Dutchman</span> (1827), with Cooke as the mysterious Vanderdecken, one of the many dumb parts then common on the stage that relied entirely on mime for their acting effectiveness. Another spectacular hit was a crime melodrama, <span class="italic">Jonathan Bradford, or, The Murder at the Roadside Inn</span> (1833), the most innovative scene of which, and one that Fitzball insisted on retaining despite the objections of actors, production staff, and management, showed a cross-section of four rooms at the inn with overlapping action proceeding in each. Fitzball claimed that <span class="italic">Jonathan Bradford</span> ran for 264 consecutive nights and was seen by 400,000 people. Even before this play he was one of London's most prolific, popular, and successful melodramatists, and his work was greatly in demand.<br>
<br>Fitzball continued to write busily, not only melodramas but also songs, burlettas, and opera librettos, including the English versions of Donizetti's <span class="italic">La favorita</span> and <span class="italic">La figlia del reggimento</span> (both Drury Lane, 1843), Wallace's <span class="italic">Maritana</span> (Drury Lane, 1845), and all the early operas of Balfe. He became a play-reader for both Drury Lane and Covent Garden, and had plays produced at both theatres. With the exception of one or two works, such as <span class="italic">Azael</span> (Drury Lane, 1851), a spectacle melodrama with an Egyptian setting, his later dramatic efforts did not achieve the success of the plays of the 1820s and 1830s. Taste was changing, and Fitzball's day as the popular purveyor of theatrical sensation was passing. A tragedy with a lavish Egyptian setting, <span class="italic">Nitocris</span>, was a disastrous failure at Drury Lane in 1855. Among his last pieces were an equestrian melodrama for the circus ring, <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> (Astley's, 1860), and an operatic version of <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (Covent Garden, 1864), with music by Macfarren.<br>
<br>In a century where dramatists typically and hurriedly wrote large numbers of plays at low rates of remuneration in order to make a living, Fitzball was among the most prolific, with a recorded output for at least 25 theatres of at least 170 melodramas, opera librettos, burlettas, tragedies, comedies, and farces, although his work in the last three categories was relatively scant: Fitzball was essentially neither a tragic nor a comic writer. His forte was the melodrama of the sea, of macabre crime, and the supernatural, such as <span class="italic">The Floating Beacon</span>, <span class="italic">Jonathan Bradford</span>, and <span class="italic">The Flying Dutchman</span>. For this last play Fitzball credited himself with the invention of a magic lantern projection from backstage onto gauze of the ghostly vessel, which grew larger, approaching the land, as the lantern retreated on its tracks further upstage. This saved the theatre the materials and labour involved in building a very large model of a ship on stage, the usual practice. If the claim is correct, this would have been the first use of back projection on the English stage.<br>
<br>Several of Fitzball's melodramas were set in exotic locations, like <span class="italic">The Earthquake, or, The Spectre of the Nile</span> (Adelphi, 1828) and <span class="italic">Thalaba the Destroyer</span> (Covent Garden, 1836), a version of Southey's poem. Although he spent many profitable years writing for Drury Lane and Covent Garden, his best work was done for the minor theatres, particularly the Surrey and the Adelphi. All his life he wrote verse and songs, one of his best and most popular being &#145;My Pretty Jane&#146;, with music by Bishop. Fitzball's autobiography, <span class="italic">Thirty-Five Years of a Dramatic Author's Life</span> (1859), is one of the most readable and informative of Victorian theatrical autobiographies, although lacking a sense of chronology. It is as colourful, lively, and vigorous as the best of his own dramatic writing.<br>
<br>Edward Fitzball died on 27 October 1873, at 141 Whittaker Terrace, Maidstone Road, Chatham, where he had retired ten years before. He was buried at Chatham.<br>
