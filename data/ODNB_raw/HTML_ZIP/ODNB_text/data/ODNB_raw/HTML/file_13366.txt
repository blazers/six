<span class="headword">Hislop,  Stephen</span>  (1817&#150;1863), <span class="occ">missionary and geologist</span>, was born at Duns, Berwickshire, on 8 September 1817, the youngest of the six children of Stephen Hislop, mason and an elder in the Relief church, and his wife, Margaret Thompson. Even as a boy he was a keen observer of nature and interested in geology, and after local schooling he went to Edinburgh University, in 1834. He then tutored for a year before beginning the study of divinity at Glasgow University. He returned to Edinburgh for the remainder of his course and was completing his preparations for the ministry when the Church of Scotland was split by the Disruption of 1843. He joined the Free Church and while waiting for his licence became secretary of the Ladies' Society for Female Education in India. In January 1844 Hislop volunteered as a missionary to the Foreign Missions Committee. On 16 July he married Erasma Hull, daughter of William Hull, plumber, of Olney, Buckinghamshire, and granddaughter of Erasmus Middleton. He was then ordained by the Free Presbytery of Edinburgh, in September, and he and his wife reached Bombay in December of the same year. During their time overseas they had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>The Free Church's main problem in India was that although it had secured the services of all its missionaries stationed there, it had lost a great deal of property. A substantial legacy was available for the establishment of a new mission at Nagpur, however, and Hislop was charged with its foundation. After a long and arduous journey, mostly on horseback, he arrived at Nagpur on 22 February 1845. Based at first at the British camp just outside the town he equipped himself for the task ahead by learning Marathi. In May 1846 he founded the school which eventually became Hislop College. In March 1847 he was joined by Robert Hunter, a man of similar interests but of very different character. The two men were particularly absorbed by the geology of central India. They collected fossils which they sent to the Geological Society of London and Hislop published a joint memoir in their own <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal</span>, as well as contributing to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span>. Hunter left India in 1855 but Hislop continued to pursue his interests; a greenish mineral which he discovered was called &#145;hislopite&#146; after him.<br>
<br>The aboriginal inhabitants of the region, the Gonds, were considered to be a promising and unprejudiced audience for missionary effort and Hislop also studied and preached in Gondi. The people were the subject of a paper to the British Association in 1859, and after Hislop's death his manuscript of <span class="italic">Papers Relating to the Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces</span> (1866) was prepared for publication by Sir Richard Temple. In 1850 Hislop acted as deputy in Madras for John Anderson, but he resisted attempts to abandon Nagpur as a mission station and make his attachment there permanent. He survived the upheaval of the Indian mutiny unscathed, having received a timely warning by which the Europeans in Nagpur were saved. He reluctantly returned home on two years' sick leave in 1858 and ministered for a while in the fishing community of Ferryden in Forfarshire, then in the grip of a religious revival. He returned to India at the end of 1860.<br>
<br>Hislop's last years at Nagpur were his most influential. He had long objected to the presence of British officials at Hindu festivals and, once the area was annexed to British rule, he continued to criticize the civil administration through letters to the <span class="italic">Friend of India</span>. After Temple became chief commissioner of the central provinces in 1862, the two men worked closely together and it was while they were on a joint tour of inspection that Hislop met his end. While returning to Bori from the study of some archaeological remains at Takalghat on 4 September 1863, in falling darkness Hislop's horse plunged into a swollen backwater and he was unseated and drowned. The turf clutched in his hands when he was found spoke of his desperate misfortune. Hislop had already cheated death several times, having survived a shipwreck, a bite from a mad dog, and a beating from a vengeful mob. He was buried in the Nagpur cemetery at Sitabaldi. Over &pound;4000 was subscribed for the care of his family.<br>
<br>Hislop was thought distinctively Scottish: tall, wiry, and rugged, with a &#145;full roundish face&#151;broader than common across the somewhat high cheek bones &hellip; prominent eyebrows, partially-sunk eyes, and deep lines slanting from the outer edges of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth&#146;  (Smith, 9); a contemporary described him as &#145;just fit for a missionary pioneer, a man full of bodily and mental energy, practical sense, and indomitable determination&#146;  (Mackenzie, 298). His words, which were few but weighty, were delivered slowly and earnestly; yet those who pierced his initial reserve found also the warmest friendship. The range of his scientific and scholarly interests was substantial, but it never interfered with his missionary ambitions. The fact that his efforts were cut short served only to emphasize the extent of his achievements.<br>
