<span class="headword">Shepherd,  William</span>  (1768&#150;1847), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and politician</span>, was born in Liverpool on 11 October 1768, the son of William Shepherd (<i>d</i>. 1772), master cordwainer, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1787), daughter of Benjamin Mather (<i>d</i>. 1749), dissenting minister of Over Darwen. The older William Shepherd, a burgess and active politician, died in 1772. Elizabeth Shepherd's brother, Tatlock Mather (<i>d</i>. 1785), minister of a Unitarian congregation at Rainford, near Prescot, took over responsibility for the impoverished family. William was educated at Holden's academy near Rainford from 1776 to 1782, by the Revd Philip Holland (1721&#150;1789) in Bolton in 1782&#150;5, at the dissenting academy at Daventry from 1785 to 1788 under Thomas Belsham (1750&#150;1829), and at New College, Hackney, from 1788 to 1790 under Belsham, Andrew Kippis (1725&#150;1795), and Richard Price (1723&#150;1791).<br>
<br>In 1790 Shepherd became tutor to the sons of the wealthy Revd John Yates (1755&#150;1826) of Toxteth Park Chapel, Liverpool, and there made the acquaintance of William Roscoe (1753&#150;1831), who greatly influenced his tastes and character. In 1791 he became minister of the Unitarian chapel at Gateacre, near Liverpool, and the next year, on marrying Frances (<i>d</i>. 1829), daughter of Robert Nicholson, merchant of Liverpool, moved to the old parsonage, The Nook, at Gateacre. There were no children. Shepherd opened a very successful school; some sense of the substance and method of his teaching can be gathered from <span class="italic">Systematic Education</span>, which he published in 1815 with two other prominent Unitarians, Lant Carpenter (1780&#150;1840) and Jeremiah Joyce (1763&#150;1816); it is a compendium of principles derived ultimately from David Hartley (1705&#150;1757) and Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804).<br>
<br>An enthusiast for civil and religious liberty, Shepherd went to London in May 1794 to visit Joyce, a friend from his years in Hackney, who had been committed to the Tower on a charge of treason. Five years later, when the Revd Gilbert Wakefield (1756&#150;1801) was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, Shepherd visited him in Dorchester gaol and took charge of his son and eldest daughter. On 27 May 1796 he became a Liverpool burgess by inheritance; an eloquent speaker, he took an active part in municipal affairs as an advanced liberal. Although he had been critical of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in its early years, he became a close friend of one of its founders, the first Lord Brougham (1778&#150;1868), and the extensive political correspondence between them is of considerable importance.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Shepherd devoted himself to writing. His interest in Italian literature, aroused by Roscoe, led in 1803 to a <span class="italic">Life of Poggio Bracciolini</span>, which was well received and translated into French, German, and Italian. In 1807 he edited for private circulation Bracciolini's <span class="italic">Dialogus an seni sit uxor ducenda</span>. The published letters of his two visits to Paris in 1802 and 1814 are of interest, and a volume of original and translated poems appeared in 1829. On 10 July 1834 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of LLD. His pedagogical, political, and literary activity led to comparative neglect of the pulpit; he wrote few new sermons, choosing rather to preach those of others, with repetitions sufficiently well spaced to allow for congregational forgetfulness.<br>
<br>In 1801 Thomas De Quincey (1785&#150;1859), then sixteen, was befriended by the Liverpool circle of whom Shepherd, Roscoe, and Dr James Currie (1756&#150;1805), physician and editor of Robert Burns, were the most prominent members. A quarter of a century later, De Quincey contemptuously dismissed their literary accomplishments and their pretension  (<span class="italic">Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, 4, 1837, 70&#150;73). While recognizing Shepherd's uprightness and patriotism, De Quincey deplored his &#145;coarseness&#146; and his disrespectful wit, presumably shown in the attacks De Quincey remembered on Anglican churchmen and on Hannah More. Shepherd replied pointedly and with dignity  (<span class="italic">Tait's</span>, 340) to this cruel elaboration of an old memory, which had given much offence in Liverpool. But, allowing for youthful priggishness, De Quincey's observations were not entirely without foundation. Shepherd had a rollicking sense of humour, which was readily turned on people and political positions he detested. Moreover, he had little sympathy for fashionable currents of thought towards the end of his long life: in 1834, in a letter to Brougham  (10 Aug 1834; University College, London, Brougham MS 14831) he noted that &#145;that useless proser Coleridge is gathered to his fathers&#146;; the young Coleridge had, of course, been an enthusiastic Unitarian, and the later Coleridge was simply incomprehensible to him.<br>
<br>After Frances Shepherd's death on 17 November 1829, the management of his household passed to his adopted child, Hannah, the youngest daughter of his old friend Jeremiah Joyce. Shepherd died at Gateacre on 21 July 1847, and was interred in the burial-ground of the chapel. His fine library was sold in Liverpool in December 1848. A marble tablet in the chapel, with an inscription by Lord Brougham, was erected in 1850, and is surmounted by a marble bust by Isaac Jackson of Liverpool.<br>
