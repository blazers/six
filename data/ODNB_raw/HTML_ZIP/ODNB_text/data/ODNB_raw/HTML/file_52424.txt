<span class="headword">Chopin,  Fryderyk Franciszek <span class="st"> [Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Fran&ccedil;ois]</span></span>  (1810&#150;1849), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born at &#379;elazowa Wola, near Warsaw, probably on 1 March 1810, the second of the four children of the Frenchman Nicolas (Miko&#322;aj) Chopin (1771&#150;1844), a tutor, and his Polish wife, Tekla-Justyna Krzy&#380;anowska (1782&#150;1861). Musically precocious, his youth was spent in Warsaw, where he studied the piano privately with Wojciech &#379;ywny and at the Warsaw conservatory with J&oacute;zef Elsner. From an early age his talents as a composer and pianist were much in demand in the leading aristocratic households in Warsaw, and he continued to move freely in such circles when he settled in Paris in 1831. Although he clearly drew much of his inspiration from a private, idealized image of Poland, Chopin found his lifestyle in Paris congenial, and he very quickly put to the back of his mind any thoughts of returning to his homeland. He made a comfortable living from teaching and from sales of his published music, and he enjoyed the friendship of some of Europe's most eminent artists and composers.<br>
<br>In 1837 Chopin paid his first visit to Britain, a two-week trip to London in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel. It was while in London that he learned of the failure of his plans to marry Maria Wodzi&#324;ska, a Polish girl of good family, and this no doubt coloured his unfavourable impressions of the city and its climate. Shortly after this visit he found himself increasingly involved with the novelist Aurore Dudevant (George Sand), and the next ten years of his life were dominated by that relationship, though it seems that they were lovers in the accepted sense for only a very short time. These were productive years for Chopin, and after the relationship ended in 1847 (partly as a result of intrigues involving Sand's children) he composed little more.<br>
<br>It was at this point&#151;in the immediate aftermath of the February revolution in Paris&#151;that Chopin visited Britain for the second time, responding to an invitation from his wealthy Scottish pupil, Jane Stirling. He arrived in London on 21 April 1848 and spent the next seven months in the country. While in London he gave private concerts at Lady Gainsborough's, at the home of the marquess of Douglas, and at Stafford House, home of the Polish sympathizer the duchess of Sutherland; Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were present at the last of these. There were also semi-public concerts at 99 Eaton Place, the home of the singer Adelaide Sartoris, and at 2 St James's Square (Lord Falmouth's), thanks mainly to the assistance of Henry Broadwood, who had become a good friend. At the end of the season Chopin was physically shattered, and had reaped few financial rewards. &#145;What are my plans for the future?&#146;, he wrote to friends in Paris. &#145;I wish I knew&#146;.<br>
<br>Against this background Jane Stirling's invitation to Scotland seemed as good an idea as any. He spent several months visiting her relatives at Calder House, Johnstone Castle, Keir House, Wishaw, and Hamilton Palace. He also fitted in a concert at Manchester, where he stayed with the Schwabes, whom he had known in Paris. This was a trying period, during which Chopin felt entirely out of his element, starved of the kind of conversation he loved, and increasingly ground down by the endless socializing. He wrote that &#145;They bore me with their exaggerated attentions. I can neither rest nor work&#146;. He was also beginning to discover something of Jane Stirling's larger plan; but, as he told Wojciech Gryzma&#322;a, &#145;I am closer to a coffin than a marriage bed&#146;  (30 Oct 1848).<br>
<br>This was literally true. When Chopin returned to London on 31 October he weighed less than 7 stone. His tuberculosis was at an advanced stage, and he was relieved to return to Paris on 23 November, though exactly a week earlier he had managed to play at a charity concert on behalf of Polish refugees. Jane Stirling helped him out financially during the last year of his life and joined the procession of people who called on him in the knowledge that his time was now limited. The soprano Pauline Viardot remarked cynically that &#145;all the grand Parisian ladies considered it <i>de rigueur</i> to faint in his room&#146;. On 12 October 1849 Alexander Jelowicki, an old acquaintance from Warsaw days, who had since taken holy orders, persuaded Chopin to partake of the last rites, though he was initially reluctant to do so. His death came in the early hours of 17 October, at about two o'clock, at 12 place Vend&ocirc;me. He was buried in P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery on 30 October.<br>
<br>In the half-century following Chopin's death his music played its part in shaping the repertory of the Victorian drawing-room. The external features of his nocturnes and mazurkas proved especially vulnerable to imitation by Victorian composers. Technically this amounted to a reduction of Chopin's densely woven textures and delicately shaped phrases to a handful of easy gestures. And in due course his own music was lumped together with his progeny. The nocturnes appeared in collections called &#145;drawing-room trifles&#146;; the preludes were described as &#145;pearls&#146;, the &eacute;tudes as &#145;tuneful gems&#146;. As Charles Hall&eacute; remarked, &#145;Chopin has become the property of every schoolgirl&#146;. He was, in short, domesticated in England, and as his music was increasingly commodified its unique features were smoothed out by their association with the surrounding lowlands of mediocrity. They became indistinguishable from their environment in a manner which strikingly foreshadowed some of the effects of the late twentieth century's culture industry.<br>
