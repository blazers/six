<span class="headword">Welsford,  Enid Elder Hancock</span>  (1892&#150;1981), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 26 February 1892 at Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex. She was the daughter of Joseph William Wilson Welsford (1856&#150;1909), mathematics master at Harrow School and a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and Mildred Laura Hancock (<i>d</i>. 1935), a painter of some note. Until 1909 Enid Welsford was educated at the Conamur School in Sandgate, Kent. A creative and sensitive child, she was the author of a book of poetry, <span class="italic">The Seagulls and other Poems</span>, which her parents had published and placed in the Cambridge University Library in 1904. At seventeen Welsford began her literary studies with W. P. Ker at University College, London, taking her first degree in 1911. In that year she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, where in 1914 she earned first-class honours in the medieval and modern languages tripos, with a distinction in Old English. At Newnham, Welsford met Nora Kershaw, later Chadwick, who became a lifelong friend. In 1915 Welsford was awarded a Marion Kennedy studentship at Newnham which she used to study comparative literature with Professor H. M. Chadwick, her friend's husband, beginning what she described as &#145;a long and delightful initiation into research&#146;  (Welsford, viii). Welsford continued her research with Chadwick until about 1917 or 1918, when she decided to concentrate on a later period of literature. She began teaching at Newnham in 1916.<br>
<br>In 1918 Welsford was awarded an associate research fellowship at Newnham, where she spent the rest of her career. She was elected a fellow in 1921 and served as director of studies in English from 1929 to 1952, as a lecturer in the faculty of English from 1923, and university lecturer from 1928 to 1959. Demonstrating her versatility, Welsford also served as director of studies in archaeology and anthropology from 1939 to 1952, and in moral sciences from 1941 to 1952. Conscious of the cold climate for women scholars in Cambridge, Welsford founded the University Women's Research Club in 1919 with M. D. Haviland, and served as its president several times.<br>
<br>Welsford's early publications included an article in the <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span>, &#145;Italian influence on the English court masque&#146;, in 1923, and four articles in the <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics</span> (1917&#150;21). Her first book, <span class="italic">The Court Masque</span>, was published in 1927. She acknowledged the influence of Professor Chadwick and her Newnham colleague Jane Ellen Harrison, describing the masque as &#145;strangely like those pantomimic ritual dances of which we hear so much from the students of comparative religion&#146;  (Welsford, viii). Extremely erudite, wide-ranging, well written and researched, <span class="italic">The Court Masque</span> was awarded the Rose Mary Crawshay prize of the British Academy in 1928, and has been reissued many times. Welsford dedicated it to her only brother, Geoffrey, who was killed in the First World War.<br>
<br>Welsford's most important work, <span class="italic">The Fool: his Social and Literary History</span>, was published in 1935. She delighted in recounting how the publisher commissioned the work, telling her that she was the ideal person to write on the subject. Well reviewed in its time, the book has remained influential, as a source for theatrical production, and inspired a Festschrift, <span class="italic">The Fool and the Trickster: Studies in Honour of Enid Welsford</span>, in 1979.<br>
<br>At Newnham Welsford was a popular if demanding teacher. She established lifelong friendships with many of her students, including literary scholars Elsie Duncan-Jones, Sita Narasimhan, and Dorothea Krook. She founded the Informal Club, where students, liberally provided by her with sweets and cigarettes, discussed literary issues of the day. As well as a respected scholar and teacher, Welsford was known for her engaging personality, absent-mindedness, and sense of humour. She relished the amusing anecdotes that were often told about her, and she loved to argue and debate. A colleague recalled examining with her for the English tripos: &#145;Miss Welsford once prolonged a meeting for three hours by her objections to one question. Of course she won&#146;  (Duncan-Jones, 219). Welsford's intellectual engagement extended into religion. An active and committed Anglican, she was, however, closely connected with the Franciscan community of St Benet's in Cambridge. She was strongly ecumenical in outlook, serving as a member of the committees of the Christian Frontier Council and the Student Christian Movement for the inter-denominational conference of university teachers from 1950 to 1959. Welsford was also remarkable for her diminutive size; she had to have clothes specially made and had some difficulty doing ordinary tasks (although she was fond of skiing, skating, and more daringly fencing).<br>
<br>Welsford remained active in the Newnham and Cambridge communities after her retirement. She continued her research, publishing <span class="italic">Salisbury Plain, a Study in the Development of Wordsworth's Mind and Art</span> in 1966, and an edition of Spenser's <span class="italic">Fowre Hymnes, Epithalamion</span> in 1967. She suffered a stroke in 1978. After several years of struggle, she died at her home, 7 Grange Road, Cambridge, on 4 December 1981. She was cremated; on 26 March 1982, as she requested, her ashes were interred in her mother's grave at Harrow.<br>
