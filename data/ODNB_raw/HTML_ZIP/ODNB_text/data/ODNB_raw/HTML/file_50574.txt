<span class="headword">Hill,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1678, <em>d.</em> 1759), <span class="occ">textile manufacturer</span>, was born in Soyland in the West Riding of Yorkshire and baptized on 7 September 1678 in the parish of Elland, Yorkshire, the son of James and Deborah (1657&#150;1741) Hill of Soyland. His early life and education remain obscure though his later financial accounts and commercial correspondence demonstrate his proficiency in bookkeeping, set down in a distinctive, florid script, with long quill strokes and decorative capitals. In 1706 he purchased a remote seventeenth-century farmstead at Making Place, Soyland, at a high altitude close to the Pennine ridge, which became both his commercial base and his home for the rest of his life. On 21 April 1712 he married Elizabeth Holroyd (1691&#150;1756) of Sowerby at Coley church in the parish of Halifax, but their family life was dogged with tragedy and disappointment. Of their six children, Sarah died on 23 July 1729, aged fifteen; her sister, Ann, on 3 April 1730 aged five; and her brothers Joseph on 14 January 1730 aged three; Samuel on 11 June 1732 aged twelve; and James on 16 January 1753, aged thirty. Moreover, their sole surviving son, Richard (<i>d</i>. 1780), who was admitted into partnership with his father in 1746, had become estranged from his father by 1752, when he set up in business on his own account. He was declared bankrupt in February 1759, and when he was effectively disinherited by his father eight months later, he complained bitterly in his diary that his father's will, which had left him &#145;in a situation too deplorable to relate&#146;, was &#145;never formed nor invented but by the devil&#146;. Indeed, litigation arising from the controversial will and associated deed poll, which had provided for the settlement of the major part of the estate upon his granddaughter, Betty Nuttall Hall, the sole surviving child of Richard Hill, when she came of age, continued until 1793. Lord Kenyon, the lord chief justice, was prompted to observe in 1790: &#145;the maker of these instruments or his advisers have certainly produced such a case as never happened before and in all probability never will happen again&#146;.<br>
<br>Hill masterminded a remarkably successful international textile marketing operation, from an unpromising upland environment, accessible only to packhorse trains, and over 70 miles from the nearest port. &#145;We have had so much rain and snow upon these hills that we could scarce get anything dry&#146;, he explained in a letter to a Dutch customer in February 1737, expressing his frustration with the protracted Pennine winter. By 1726 he had become sufficiently well established to issue a promissory note to his brother James's creditors. He was then operating an extensive putting-out system, buying wool from all over the country and arranging for it to be spun and woven by a network of domestic outworkers, perhaps numbering as many as 250 by the 1730s. Initially, Hill traded primarily in woollen kerseys, his largest consignments destined for charitable institutions, for example Christ's Hospital, as well as military and naval requisitions and the export market. He supplied customers in most parts of Europe, especially the Low Countries, Spain, Portugal, and Russia, and indeed further afield, dispatching at least one pattern sheet to Persia, via St Petersburg and Astrakhan. He entered the worsted trade only in the 1730s, a generation after the trade had been introduced into the West Riding of Yorkshire, when worsteds were rapidly becoming fashionable for the middling and lower ranks of society, obtaining his supplies from both domestic outworkers and independent worsted manufacturers. His surviving business records reveal that the value of his annual turnover of cloth never fell below &pound;23,000 during the period 1744&#150;50, reaching a peak in excess of &pound;35,527 in 1747, and confirm that he was still primarily a kersey manufacturer, selling twice as many kerseys as worsteds during the 1740s. A later pattern book, containing an impressive range of samples in both fabrics from 1750, displays the superb quality, brilliance, and diversity of colour and design achieved in the weaving and dyeing of his cloth. By this time he was one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the West Riding.<br>
<br>Hill is revealed in his correspondence as a sturdy, independent character with a shrewd business sense, determined to maintain a reputation for quality at a competitive price, insisting that his cloth, much of which carried his own name or the names of individual members of his family, was &#145;not to be outdone in England by any man&#146;. Stubbornly resolute in refusing &#145;to deal with those who will not accept my goods at market price when ready&#146;, he displayed flexibility in his willingness to sell worsteds initially &#145;for small profit till they be known&#146; and his readiness to realize &#145;as near as I can&#146; the exact specifications of his customers. Moreover, his wife helped to cultivate special relationships with prized customers, by supplying them with token gifts of ham and tongue. Hill was also evidently a considerate and respected employer. He was anxious to avoid frequent changes in production so as not &#145;to spoil the weavers&#146; and at least one former employee fondly recalled in a letter to his son Richard his &#145;good father&#146;. He invested most of his wealth in local property, transforming Making Place and nearby Kebroyd into &#145;elegant places&#146;, lavishing upon the former &#145;at least &pound;8000, and upon the latter &pound;4000&#146;, as his son, Richard, observed in his diary.<br>
<br>Samuel Hill died at his home, Making Place, Soyland, on 22 October 1759. He was buried in the churchyard of the chapel-of-ease at Ripponden on 24 October, where, according to its curate, the antiquary John Watson, he had erected a &#145;handsome well-cut tombstone&#146; over the vault containing the remains of his wife and children, and where he had planted a grove of yew trees with the help of John Collier (1708&#150;1786), alias Tim Bobbin, the Lancashire artist and dialect poet, an erstwhile frequent visitor to Soyland. However, Watson made no reference in his parish history of 1775 to any epitaph, inscription, or monument to Hill at Ripponden. Moreover, Hill's intended public benefaction of a bridge at Soyland was apparently never realized. Nearly 200 years after his death, Hill provided the inspiration for the Halifax novelist Phyllis Bentley's character Sam Horsfall in her historical novel <span class="italic">Manhold</span>, published in New York in 1941.<br>
