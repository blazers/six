<span class="headword">Dunbar family</span>, earls of Moray  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1370&#150;1430), <span class="occ"></span>was important in the conduct of Anglo-Scottish warfare in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. <a name="cosubject_54175"></a><span class="headword">John Dunbar</span>, first earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> 1391/2)<span class="occ"></span>, and his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54172/', "George Dunbar, later ninth earl of Dunbar")</script>, were the sons of Sir Patrick Dunbar and his wife, Isabel Randolph. They first came to prominence as royal favourites late in the reign of David II when their sister Agnes became the king's mistress. In 1370 John made a prestigious marriage with Marjory Stewart (<i>d</i>. after 1403), the daughter of David's nephew and heir apparent, Robert the Steward (the future Robert II). Later chroniclers suggest that the Steward was less than happy with his daughter's marriage, which may have been arranged by David II, no doubt influenced by his mistress. In autumn 1370 the king granted John the lordship of the earldom of Fife, a territory that the Steward and his family had long coveted. After David II's death on 22 February 1371 and the accession of Robert II, however, Dunbar found his hold on Fife challenged by the new king's son (and Dunbar's brother-in-law) Robert Stewart, earl of Menteith and later duke of Albany. The dispute between Dunbar and Earl Robert was ended about 9 March 1372, when the former gave up his claims to Fife, receiving in compensation a grant of the earldom of Moray, to which he had a claim through his mother. Moray's hold on the northern earldom was made problematic by the conditions of the 1372 grant. Strategic lordships such as Lochaber, Badenoch, and the castle and barony of Urquhart, which had been part of the earldom created for Thomas Randolph in 1312, were specifically excepted from the grant because they had been seized by or gifted to other powerful lords in the years after the death of the third and last Randolph earl in 1346. The truncated earldom proved difficult to defend, and Moray soon found himself embroiled in a series of territorial and jurisdictional clashes with forceful neighbours, including Alexander Stewart, another son of Robert II who was lord of Badenoch and later earl of Buchan, and Alexander Bur, bishop of Moray. Earl John was prepared to invest in his new lordship and he seems to have been responsible for the building of a new hall at Darnaway Castle (now known, mistakenly, as Randolph's Hall) in the years shortly before his death. Overall, however, the evidence suggests that the Dunbar earls lacked the local network of kin and allies to maintain a firm hold on the upland zones surrounding the Moray coastal plain.<br>
<br>Moreover, despite his acquisition of an important northern earldom, Moray also retained an active role in Anglo-Scottish warfare and diplomacy. He was involved in the escalation of pressure on English-occupied lands in the south of Scotland in the years after the death of Edward III in 1377 and took a leading role in the major Franco-Scottish campaign against targets in the north of England during 1385, when he received a large payment (1000 livres tournois) from the French war-chest for his services and was regarded by the chronicler Froissart as one of the principal Scottish leaders. He also played a prominent part, alongside his brother, George, and James, second earl of Douglas, in the Scottish campaign in the north of England which culminated in the battle of Otterburn on 5 August 1388. Moray's role in the engagement is commemorated in Thomas Barry's contemporary Latin poem and in Walter Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span>, where the earl is said to have fought bareheaded after a surprise English attack on the Scottish force.<br>
<br>Moray's interest in warfare and the display of martial prowess was not blunted by the conclusion of an Anglo-Scottish truce in 1389. In the next two years he received several safe conducts to allow his participation in jousts and tournaments in England and he was a prominent figure at a tournament held at Smithfield in the summer of 1390 by Richard II. The exact date and circumstances surrounding his death are difficult to determine. Later English chronicles contain garbled accounts suggesting that he died at York of injuries sustained in a joust with Thomas Mowbray, earl of Nottingham. There were indeed plans for a duel between the two men in May 1390, but either the combat did not take place then or Moray survived it, for he was still alive on 13 June 1391, when he applied for a further English safe conduct. He died between the latter date and 15 February 1392; his demise may have occurred in England as a result of wounds received in a tournament, but there is no conclusive evidence.<br>
<br>Moray's marriage to Marjory Stewart produced at least four children, Thomas, Alexander, James, and Euphemia. He was succeeded as earl of Moray by their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54176"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Dunbar</span>, second earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1422)<span class="occ"></span>, who was using the comital style by 15 February 1392. Thomas also inherited the strategic problems of the Moray earldom. Even before he became earl he had been made aware of the difficulties of protecting lowland Moray from neighbouring lordships, when in 1390 he replaced Alexander Stewart as sheriff of Inverness and entered into an agreement to protect the bishop of Moray's lands and estates from the exactions of Stewart's followers. In response Stewart's men burnt the bishop's houses and property in Elgin and Forres in May and June, with Moray apparently unable to intervene, and in August Robert III supported Bishop Bur when he asserted that the agreement with Moray was no longer binding because he had failed to protect the bishop's property. The weakness of the Dunbar earls and the vulnerability of Moray was further emphasized in Thomas's agreement of September 1394 with Alastair MacDomhnaill, lord of Lochaber, whereby the latter was to receive an annual payment from the earl in return for preventing his men from raiding or living off lands inside the earldom. The problem of disorder in the highland zones around Moray resurfaced in 1396, when Thomas played a leading part in arranging the famous &#145;Clan Fight&#146; on the north inch of Perth, a formal conflict designed to bring an end to a long-running and violent feud between two highland kindreds. Thereafter references to him are few. He was among the many Scots captured by the English at the battle of Hamildon Hill on 14 September 1402 and remained a prisoner in England until July 1405. He was apparently still alive in June 1415, but had died before August 1422. The identity of his wife is unknown; they had a son and heir, also Thomas, who succeeded to the earldom before 9 August 1422.<br>
<br>Most aspects of the short career of the younger <a name="cosubject_54177"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Dunbar</span>, third earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1425)<span class="occ"></span>, remain obscure. In June 1415, before he became earl, it was evidently intended that he should marry Euphemia Leslie, countess of Ross, and a papal dispensation for the marriage was obtained. However, the match was never finalized and instead Euphemia resigned her lands and earldom in favour of John Stewart, earl of Buchan. Moray was one of the Scottish lords named as a surety for the payment of James I's ransom when the king was released from English captivity in 1424, and was consequently warded in England from March 1424 until July 1425. He died shortly afterwards, to be succeeded by his cousin <a name="cosubject_54178"></a><span class="headword">James Dunbar</span>, fourth earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> 1430)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Alexander Dunbar and Matilda Fraser and grandson of the first earl. The exact date of James's accession to the earldom is unknown, but he seems to have been acting as earl before he died. Like his cousin, James was one of the hostages for James I's release and between 1425 and November 1427 he was held in England. He died on or about 10 August 1430, leaving two daughters from his marriage to Margaret Seton: Janet, who married James, second Lord Crichton between 1442 and 1446, and Elizabeth, who before 26 April 1442 married Archibald Douglas, the third son of James, seventh earl of Douglas. His widow married Alexander Stewart, twelfth earl of Mar. The Moray title went with Elizabeth, and by 3 July 1445 Archibald Douglas was styling himself earl of Moray. The line of Dunbar earls thus ended, although James had an illegitimate son, Alexander, who founded the Dunbar of Westfield line which retained a local influence inside Moray.<br>
