<span class="headword">Bayley,  Mary</span>  (<em>b. </em>1816, <em>d.</em> in or after 1892), <span class="occ">temperance activist and writer</span>, was born in Market Lavington, Wiltshire. Nothing is known of her early life. Her husband, George Bayley (1807&#150;1888), was born in Rotherhithe, served in the merchant navy between the ages of sixteen and forty-four, and was an elder brother of the Trinity House for thirty-one years. Presumably influenced by his wife, who was already active in the temperance movement, Bayley became an abstainer at the age of fifty-three. Mary and George Bayley had five daughters, the first of whom was born in 1846; only one, the novelist and writer Elizabeth Boyd Bayley, outlived her parents. After a period abroad (the eldest Bayley daughter was born in Calcutta), the family settled in London, first at 8 Lansdowne Crescent in Kensington. They moved to Barnet in 1864, for the sake of the children's health, and latterly lived in Kempshott Road, Streatham Common. Mary Bayley also suffered from poor health: in the autumn of 1860 she suffered a long and severe illness which struck her again in 1882, and from about 1887 until her death she regarded herself as an invalid.<br>
<br>An Anglican hostile to Roman Catholicism, Mrs Bayley's principal concern was the effect of alcohol abuse on the working classes. She believed that &#145;this dreadful vice&#146; was responsible for filling England with &#145;moral wrecks&#146; and caused the deaths of 60,000 people a year. Her aim was to eliminate male drunkenness through the domestic influence of wives and mothers, explaining that &#145;long experience had taught me that all real, healthy, permanent, domestic reform must begin with the mother&#146;  (M. Bayley, <span class="italic">Mended Homes and what Repaired Them</span>, 1861, 26, 5). In 1853 Mary Bayley began her mothers' meetings in the notorious Kensington potteries area, offering working-class women religious and domestic education, and bringing women of different social classes together so that the rich could exercise a good influence over the poor.<br>
<br>Mary Bayley doubted that it was wise for poor women to be employed outside the home. In her pamphlets she argued that if poor women went out to work, they would have less time to make their homes attractive to their husbands and sons; if their homes were uncomfortable, the men would go to the public house and waste their money on drink. This would mean that the household needed more money to survive, thus driving women out to work and producing a vicious circle of drinking and decline. Mrs Bayley particularly attacked laundry work for women&#151;an occupation much associated with female drunkenness&#151;arguing in <span class="italic">Mended Homes</span> that washing machines operated by men should be introduced to allow poor women to go back to their proper places by the domestic fireside.<br>
<br>Having concentrated at first on the failings of working-class wives and mothers, Mary Bayley turned her attention in 1860 to the position of the men themselves. With her husband and other sympathizers she established a model Workmen's Temperance Hall in Portland Road, Notting Hill. The hall was opened on 12 March 1861 by Samuel Gurney before a large ecumenical gathering attended by the bishop of London. The object of the hall was to provide working men with a place to meet which would be a real alternative both to the warmth and congeniality of the public house and to their impoverished homes: it was to be a self-financing coffee house, offering working men non-alcoholic refreshments and bathing facilities in pleasant surroundings. The attached <span class="roman">Bible</span> mission provided non-sectarian religious teaching to reinforce the temperance message. The Bayleys had great plans for the hall and the temperance society which supported it, but their experiment was short-lived. They moved away from the area in 1864, and without their constant support the hall's fortunes declined. In 1866 a problem arose over the title to the hall and it closed its doors. However, Elizabeth Boyd Bayley later claimed that the hall had been of considerable significance as an influence on the work of Ellice Hopkins, the purity campaigner, and Louisa Daniells, the founder of the Soldiers' Homes.<br>
<br>Mary Bayley was a prolific writer of pamphlets championing temperance and female domesticity, including <span class="italic">Ragged Homes and how to Mend them</span> (1860), <span class="italic">Danger Signals: how to Use them Wisely</span> (1887), and <span class="italic">Home Weal and Home Woe</span> (1892), which was written in collaboration with her daughter Elizabeth. She died in or after 1892.<br>
