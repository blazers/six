<span class="headword">Raikes,  Henry Cecil</span>  (1838&#150;1891), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 25 November 1838 at the deanery, Chester, the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_45558"></a><span class="headword">Henry Raikes</span>  (1811&#150;1863), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, of Llwynegrin Hall, Mold, Flintshire, and his wife, Lucy Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Archdeacon Francis Wrangham FRS. He had four brothers and five sisters. His father, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23014/', "Henry Raikes (1782&#150;1854)")</script>, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whittington, was high sheriff of Flintshire and registrar of the Chester diocese as well as being on the north Wales circuit; his two-volume <span class="italic">Popular sketch of the origin and development of the English constitution, from the earliest period to the present time</span> was published between 1851 and 1854. He supervised the early education of his eldest son, who later recalled &#145;a diet of English Constitution&#146;  (Raikes, 8), but in 1846 sent him to Shrewsbury School where he thrived, entering the sixth form at the age of thirteen, excelling in classics, and becoming head of school. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1856, and was elected a scholar in 1859, but his constant involvement with the university union, of which he became president in 1859, contributed to his taking a second in the classical tripos in 1860, a result he constantly rued. That same year he entered the Middle Temple and while studying for the law there, he married Charlotte Blanche Trevor Roper (<i>d</i>. 1922), fourth daughter of Charles Blayney Trevor Roper of Plas Teg, Flintshire, on 26 September 1861. He was called to the bar on 30 April 1863 and after a brief spell as a journalist he joined the north Wales circuit, but his interest in the law was minimal: politics was the abiding passion of his life.<br>
<br>Greatly influenced by Disraeli's concept of popular Conservatism, Raikes's desire to stand for parliament was constantly opposed by his father, who had twice unsuccessfully contested the Derby seat for the Conservatives. The latter's death left Raikes free to stand for Chester in 1865 and although defeated he was selected for the Devonport by-election in April 1866 but, again, was unsuccessful. In the following year, Raikes founded the short-lived <span class="italic">Imperial Review</span> and worked assiduously with Lord Nevill in the creation of a national union of local Conservative and constitutional associations. Raikes was convinced that any mass political party wishing either to gain or to retain power in the future would have to &#145;ascertain how far their proceedings were in harmony with the wishes of the people&#146;  (McKenzie, 158) and felt that this should be the union's major role, but he was not supported in this by the party leaders. He won the Chester seat in the 1868 general election despite the significant swing against the Conservative Party. Raikes remained chairman of the national union council until 1875 but found his role in party affairs being supplanted by J. E. Gorst, one colleague observing that the tall, thin Raikes, with &#145;his smiling eyes and soft deliberate voice &hellip; [was] a little indefinite in plan and careless in detail&#146; whereas the short, prosaic Gorst possessed a &#145;genius for organisation &hellip; [an] inflexible will and untiring diligence&#146;  (Clarke, 95). Raikes's efforts were acknowledged by Disraeli's offer of the positions of chairman of ways and means and deputy speaker of the House of Commons following the Conservative success in the 1874 general election. Raikes knew that the offer reflected an intention to shelve his political aspirations, ironically because of his views and middle-class background, and he acquiesced only very reluctantly, being keenly aware of the likely consequences of refusal. His rather autocratic manner and substantial knowledge of procedure suited both positions and over the next six years he gained general acclaim for his firmness, courtesy, and discretion in the face of significant obstruction by Irish MPs in some debates. A cartoon in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (1875) signalled his growing political stature.<br>
<br>In the 1880 general election Raikes was stunned by the loss of his Chester seat and although the Conservatives petitioned to have the result overturned on the grounds of corruption he decided to sever his links with the town. The award of a privy councillorship in March 1880 provided some compensation for his loss, as did his election as a bencher of the Middle Temple two months later, but he had missed the chance of becoming speaker of the House of Commons. His return to the Commons in February 1882 as the MP for Preston reflected strong support from his party leaders in this instance, but this was not forthcoming when he resigned in the following November to contest the vacant University of Cambridge seat: this made his victory all the sweeter. A vociferous opponent of some of Gladstone's proposals for parliamentary reform, especially that of the closure of debates, Raikes was also highly critical of Sir Stafford Northcote's ineffective leadership of the opposition, being a supporter of Lord Salisbury. He used his considerable journalistic skills to publicize his views and also founded the <span class="italic">National Review</span> in March 1883, with Alfred Austin, in order to provide a public forum for the discussion of Conservatism. His independent stance and unwillingness to serve with Northcote, combined with an erroneous estimate of his own political standing, ensured his exclusion from office in Lord Salisbury's first administration of 1885&#150;6. When Salisbury formed his second government in 1886, Raikes was only offered the minor position of postmaster-general, which he accepted.<br>
<br>Raikes did not enjoy his tenure as postmaster-general but he was determined to be the master of his department. He rapidly acquired a substantial knowledge of its operations, which, coupled with his despotic manner, enabled him to realize his aim but led to conflicts with his staff. His determination to secure the optimum provision of postal services generated confrontation with companies which had previously enjoyed monopolies in certain sectors. In two instances Raikes was able to secure considerable improvements to services, as well as substantial financial savings, by the negotiation of new contracts, in which he enjoyed the support of both the cabinet and the House of Commons. But in the conflict with Boy Messengers Limited in 1891 he was forced to compromise in the face of both cabinet and public pressure, and he found this an unpleasant experience. His belief that the Post Office should set an example by the liberal treatment of its staff was offset by his firm handling of unrest over conditions of service between January 1890 and April 1891, and the attendant conflict with the Postmen's Union. This earned him considerable public obloquy at the time, but ultimately respect for the improved conditions he managed to wrest from Treasury.<br>
<br>Lord Cranbrook believed Raikes had demonstrated significant administrative powers as postmaster-general, although another contemporary felt that he was essentially an official by nature and thus possessed the defect of his qualities. Edward Hamilton contended that Raikes's failure to achieve his political aims reflected his unpopularity within the Conservative Party as a result of his general conduct and his inability to &#145;say or do anything without saying it or doing it in the wrong manner&#146;  (Hamilton, BL, Add. MS 48656). Some later historians, notably Hanham, Feuchtwanger, and Shannon concur with Hamilton's analysis while acknowledging Raikes's contributions to the national union, party organization, and the post-Disraeli leadership struggle.<br>
<br>A committed lay member of the Anglican church, Raikes served as chairman of the Church Defence Institution (1868&#150;74), president of the Central Council of Diocesan Conferences (1881&#150;5), and from 1890 as chancellor of the diocese of St Asaph. His defence of the church in the Commons was notable, especially on the issue of Welsh disestablishment. He served as deputy lieutenant of Flintshire from 1864 until his death and received an honorary LLD from Cambridge University in 1888. He died suddenly on 24 August 1891 at his home, Llwynegrin Hall, Flintshire, and was buried on 27 August at St Mary's Church, Mold. He was survived by his wife.<br>
