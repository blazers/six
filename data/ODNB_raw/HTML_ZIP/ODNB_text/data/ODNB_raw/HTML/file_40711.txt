<span class="headword">Davis, Sir  Edmund Gabriel</span>  (1861&#150;1939), <span class="occ">mining financier and art collector</span>, was born on 3 August 1861 at Tintern, Gardiner's Creek Road, Toorak, Melbourne, Australia, the second of the four children of Samuel Davis, merchant, and his wife, Josephine, daughter of Jacob Bensusan. He had two brothers and one sister. At the age of eight Davis moved to Paris with his parents. He was educated at Highburn House, St Leonards, and at the Coll&egrave;ge Chaptal in Paris, where he studied painting at the studio of Victor Leclaire. In 1879 he left for the Cape Colony, where he was employed by his uncle's firm, M. L. Bensusan &amp; Co. of Cape Town. Here Davis laid the basis of his later fortune, initially by leasing guano islands off the Cape Coast, and soon afterwards by acquiring copper and railway interests in South-West Africa. The beginning of 1888 found him on the goldfields of Barberton and the Witwatersrand, from where he left for Paris in order to raise capital for his Transvaal ventures. When none of them proved successful, Davis shifted his operations to London, becoming a partner in the firm of Jacob Picard &amp; Co. in 1889. In the same year he married his cousin, Mary Zillah Halford (1866&#150;1941). They had no children.<br>
<br>Davis's South African contacts brought an unending stream of speculative mining ventures to his attention. In the 1890s these were in two areas: central Africa, where Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company was ruthlessly establishing its authority under the auspices of a royal charter; and west Africa. By 1904 Davis had acquired sufficient notoriety through his vigorous promotion of dubious concerns on the fringes of the City's capital market for <span class="italic">The Economist</span> to denounce him by name. Holding more than fifty directorships, and chairman of twelve companies, Davis had interests spanning the globe. At this stage of his career they included gold- and diamond-mining companies in Africa and South America, as well as tramway companies in Hong Kong and Singapore. In the decade before 1914, Davis and Herbert Hoover, later president of the United States of America, became embroiled in controversy when they successfully manipulated the share ownership of the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company in order to wrest control of the Kaiping collieries from their Chinese owners. To many of his Edwardian contemporaries, Davis seemed to be merely the latest in a long line of shady company promoters.<br>
<br>But although a faint air of sharp practice clung to him for the rest of his life, this was also the period in which Davis first displayed his unequalled talent for winning control of business involved in important base minerals. He increasingly devoted his time to constructing cartels. Monopoly or near monopoly control over large sections of the base mineral industry was the key to much of his subsequent success. It was a strategy which he employed to marked effect in coal, chrome, asbestos, manganese, copper, tungsten, tin, and vanadium mining. &#145;I have ever had a leaning towards base metals in preference to the more precious ores&#146;, insisted Davis. &#145;They have always interested me. I like tonnages&#146;  (<span class="italic">African World Annual</span>, 1933, 40).<br>
<br>During and after the First World War the fortunes of Davis's enterprises soared. His control over the production of chrome, a commodity regarded as vital to the allied war effort because of its steel-hardening qualities, allowed him to repair his battered reputation. From 1915 onwards Davis worked closely with the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions in securing supplies of key minerals for Britain and France, while simultaneously denying them to the central powers. Because of Davis's intervention, so <span class="italic">The Times</span> claimed on 22 February 1939, &#145;Germany found herself practically &#147;frozen out&#148; from chrome ore, as was indicated by the erratic firing of some German guns towards the end of hostilities&#146;.<br>
<br>The coming of peace saw Davis presiding over an international network of companies and mines that between them controlled about 90 per cent of world chrome production. Although he was never able to replicate the same degree of control over other base minerals, he none the less steadily expanded the scope of his asbestos and copper mining interests in the course of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929, after successfully waging a savage price-cutting war against Canadian producers, Davis was invited by Turner and Newall, the largest British company in the field, to merge his interests with theirs. Sealed just before the great depression caused prices to tumble, the deal enormously strengthened Turner and Newall's hand in winning an important share of the dwindling world market for asbestos products.<br>
<br>Over the same two decades Davis played a crucial role in the development of the Northern Rhodesian copperbelt. Together with Sir Chester Beatty and Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, he was instrumental in raising the huge sums of capital required to bring mines to the point of production in a part of the world remote from major markets. In all of this, Davis occupied a pivotal position on the board of the British South Africa Company, which he had joined in 1925. The net result made him an extremely powerful figure in the economy of central Africa. Not surprisingly, Davis loomed large in the calculations of settler politicians. &#145;Everybody knows that the economic dictator of this country is Edmund Davis&#146;, the Southern Rhodesian house of assembly was told. &#145;There may be a case for monarchy; but the King should not sit in an office in London, he should be a Rhodesian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Debates of the Legislative Assembly</span>, 1930).<br>
<br>Despite his financial success, Davis was fond of saying that he could have made as much out of art as he did in business. A noted connoisseur and collector, pictures were with him a passion. With the help of Charles Ricketts, Davis and his wife launched themselves into the art market as major collectors in the late 1890s. Their purchases included paintings of the old masters, and Victorian and modern works. They also owned a collection of major Rodin sculptures. As active patrons of the arts, the Davises' inner circle of artist friends included Ricketts himself, Charles Shannon, James Pryde, and George Lambert. All of them at one time or another lived at Lansdowne House, a block of artists' studios designed for Davis by William Flockhard.<br>
<br>Davis's magnificent art collection was displayed in his Holland Park home, 13 Lansdowne Road, which was designed for him in 1896; and at Chilham Castle in Kent, which he acquired in November 1918. Situated near Canterbury, Chilham was repaired by Sir Herbert Baker. As part of the renovations an enclosed swimming pool was constructed, and here Davis liked to exercise surrounded by Rodin statues. Lesser pictures filled his houses in Venice and the French riviera. Davis's hospitality was famously lavish. Known as a big earner and a big spender, he entertained frequently. Favoured artist friends were taken on Mediterranean cruises on his yacht, the <i>Catania</i>; and his musical evenings regularly employed entire orchestras. Davis was said particularly to enjoy fancy-dress balls.<br>
<br>In 1915 Davis presented a major collection of contemporary British paintings to the Luxembourg gallery in Paris, for which he was decorated by the president of France, Raymond Poincar&eacute;. In 1935 and again the following year he donated paintings and bronzes to the South African National Gallery, but in 1938 his collection suffered a major loss when thieves broke into Chilham Castle and made off with five paintings. These included <span class="italic">Saskia at her Toilet</span> by Rembrandt, and portraits by Reynolds, Van Dyck, and Gainsborough. The two Gainsboroughs were found abandoned in a local wood, but the other paintings were never recovered. Davis's collection did not outlive him; the Rodins were sold privately, and the remaining paintings auctioned. At his death his estate was valued at &pound;394,518 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Davis brought to his art collection the energy and conscientious attention which also characterized his business operations. Renowned for his astonishing memory, he was widely recognized as having a genius for finance as well as a gift for intense concentration on detail. At shareholders' meetings he invariably spoke without notes. Always busy, he was reputed by his associates to be one of the most difficult men in the City with whom to make an appointment at short notice. Short and, in later life, increasingly stout, Davis was thought to bear more than a passing resemblance to Napoleon. Certainly he relished being known as the &#145;Napoleon of finance&#146;, and the &#145;Napoleon of Northern Rhodesia&#146;. He was knighted in 1927. His sudden death on 20 February 1939 at Chilham Castle left his contemporaries as divided in their opinion of him as they had been during his life. While some celebrated the lightning quickness of his brain and his generosity towards friends, others remembered him for his bluntness and irascibility.<br>
