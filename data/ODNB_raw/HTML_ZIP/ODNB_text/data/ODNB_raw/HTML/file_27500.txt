<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tollemache <span class="st"> [Tolmach, Talmach, Talmash]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1651&#150;1694), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second surviving son of Sir Lionel Tollemache, baronet (1624&#150;1669), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19601/', "Lady Elizabeth Murray")</script>, from 1655 countess of Dysart and afterwards also duchess of Lauderdale (<i>bap</i>. 1626, <i>d</i>. 1698). It was rumoured that his mother had been Cromwell's mistress and that he was Oliver's son. According to Lord Dartmouth, Tollemache &#145;had a peculiar sort of vanity in desiring it should be understood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 4.228). Nevertheless, Sir Lionel was in no doubt that he was his own son and made ample provision for him in his will.<br>
<br>Tollemache was brought up at Helmingham in Suffolk and according to the inscription on his monument &#145;His natural abilities and first education were improved by his travels into foreign nations, where he spent several years, in the younger part of his life, in the observation of their genius, customs, politicks and interests&#146;. Tollemache had returned to England by 1668 when he was admitted as a fellow commoner on 22 May to Queens' College, Cambridge. Entering the Inner Temple in the same year he was later created MA by Queens' in 1669.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitarycareer"></a>Early military career</h2>Soon afterwards Tollemache joined the army, and by 1673 was serving as a captain in Cologne. He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards on 16 January 1678 as a captain, but served for most of the year in Flanders as the lieutenant-colonel of a regiment raised by his cousin, Lord Alington. The regiment returned to England in early 1679 and was disbanded in April, freeing Tollemache to rejoin the Coldstreamers in May. In 1680 Tollemache was posted with a detachment of Coldstream Guards to the English outpost of Tangier, then under threat from the Moors. On 18 September he volunteered to command the advance guard in the successful but bloody attempt to recover the Pole Fort and later in the month he negotiated a temporary treaty with the Moors. On 27 October 1680 he took part in the garrison's last and most successful battle in which he and Percy Kirke were praised for having &#145;behaved themselves like brave and gallant men&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Particular Relation</span>). Tollemache arrived back in England from Tangier on 26 November 1680. In June 1682 he fought a duel, following which he lost his commission in the guards and returned to Tangier as a volunteer.<h2>
<a name="SupporterofWilliamIII"></a>Supporter of William III</h2>Back in England by 1685 Tollemache was given the lieutenant-colonelcy of the newly raised Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, but in April 1686 he resigned his commission in protest at the admission of Catholics into the army. He was a leading member of the Treason Club, a group of youngish would-be politicians and officers led by Henry Wharton and Lord Colchester who met in the Rose tavern in Covent Garden with the purpose of encouraging and assisting an armed intervention by William of Orange. In March 1688 Tollemache was made the colonel of an English regiment in the pay of the Dutch government and sailed to the Netherlands, from where he kept in touch with his fellow conspirators in England. In November 1688 he returned as part of William's invasion force. His regiment formed the advance guard on the march from Torbay to London and occupied the Tower on 19 December 1688. In that same month he was appointed governor of Portsmouth and in January 1689 he was, through the influence of Henry Wharton, elected to parliament as the member for Malmesbury.<br>
<br>Tollemache was rewarded for his service to William III on 1 May 1689 by being made colonel of the Coldstream Guards. He was posted with his regiment to von Waldeck's allied army in Flanders where he played an important part in the victory at Walcourt (15 August 1689). After spending the winter in England, Tollemache returned to Flanders in spring 1690 to command the six British battalions that had been left there. In the summer he was ordered to join von Waldeck's army, but could not leave Ghent until money arrived from England to pay the debts incurred over the winter. In consequence he and his command missed the battle of Fleurus (21 June 1690). He spent the rest of the campaign in Flanders and in October 1690 commanded the battalions sent to winter in Brussels, after which he returned to England. He was promoted to major-general on 20 December and was ordered back to Flanders.<h2>
<a name="Ireland"></a>Ireland</h2>In May 1691 Tollemache was recalled to join the campaign in Ireland. He arrived in Dublin in June and joined Ginckel's army during the attack on Athlone. The Irish army had dug in on the west bank of the Shannon and had broken the bridge that separated them from the English. Tollemache proposed a simple but daring plan in which a few hundred armoured men would wade through the river to seize the bridgehead on the other side and hold it long enough for planks to be laid across the broken span so that the infantry could charge across the bridge. Ginckel was anxious to try any solution and, desperate though it was, Tollemache's plan was adopted.<br>
<br>To Tollemache's disappointment he was not allowed to put his own plan into action because the major-generals commanded in strict rotation, and Major-General Hugh Mackay refused to relinquish his turn. Mackay thought Tollemache's plan &#145;defied all the rules of law and policy&#146;  (Mackay, 144) as once the English troops had seized the town the whole Irish army, which was camped on the far side of Athlone, would drive them straight out again. On the day of the assault, 30 June 1691, Tollemache took part as a volunteer. He was carried through the river by his grenadiers and was the fifth man into the breach. The Irish were driven out of Athlone within the hour and the expected counter-attack never came. The French general of the Irish army, St Ruth, had ignored advice to tear down Athlone's western defences, and the English found themselves protected from the Irish by the town's walls.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1691 Tollemache commanded an infantry division in the centre of Ginckel's army at Aughrim. The Irish infantry attacked Ginckel's centre by crossing the bog that divided the two armies. Tollemache raced to support &#145;with some fresh men, he gave orders for our broken regiments to halt, and face about, which they did&#146;  (Story, 132). The Irish were chased back across the bog and eventually defeated in the bloodiest battle of the war.<br>
<br>Tollemache served in the short investment of Galway (19&#150;29 July 1691) where his bravery and diligence were again praised. In a successful attack on the outworks it was noted that &#145;Major General <i>Talmash</i> would needs go a Volunteer as he usually did when it was not his turn to command&#146;  (Story, 163). He also took part in the siege of Limerick, and on 16 September 1691 supervised the construction of a pontoon across the Shannon and established a bridgehead through which most of the army later marched. After the Irish surrender of 3 October 1691 he remained behind as governor of Limerick. Once all the Irish troops had marched out he left for Dublin, on 9 November, and returned to England.<h2>
<a name="FlandersandEngland"></a>Flanders and England</h2>Amid rumours that he was going to resign his commission in disgust at the preference given to William's Dutch officers over his British ones, Tollemache was summoned to a two hour private interview with the king &#145;who is extremely satisfied with his conduct of matters&#146;  (Luttrell, <span class="italic">Brief Historical Relation</span>, 2.338). On 23 January 1692, the same day on which he was sworn in as the member of parliament for Chippenham, Tollemache was promoted to lieutenant-general. He accompanied the Coldstream Guards to Flanders in March, but in May he was ordered back to England to take command of the army to oppose the threatened invasion by James II's Franco-Irish army. Once the danger had been averted by the destruction of the French fleet off La Hogue (19&#150;24 May 1692) he returned to Flanders and served in the battle of Steenkerke (3 August 1692), where, although the French were victorious, &#145;our foot [were] brought off by the great conduct of lieutenant general Talmach&#146;  (ibid., 2.528). In the parliamentary debate on Steenkerke (23 November 1692) several members complained that the Dutchman Count Solms had been promoted over the better qualified Tollemache. Lord Colchester, the one-time chairman of the Rose tavern Treason Club, asserted that &#145;There is not a braver man in the world than General Tollemache&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell</span>, 255).<br>
<br>In September 1692 Tollemache was made governor of Dixmunde where he commanded a force of 12,000 men and foiled a French attempt to cut him off from Dunkirk and, in December, a threat to take both Dixmunde and Furnes. He arrived back in England on 22 December 1692. In March 1693 he took over as governor of the Isle of Wight in the king's absence, and in April was granted the rents for three years of almost 13,000 acres of forfeited land in Ireland. He returned to Flanders that month and in May he commanded the British troops outside Ghent. At the battle of Landen (29 July 1693) he played an important part in resisting the French attacks and had a horse killed under him.<br>
<br>On 11 December 1693 Tollemache addressed parliament in favour of the increased army estimates for 1694.<blockquote>It may be thought that I, having no estate, am ready to put the nation to a great charge; but I do declare I am as weary of war as any person and as desirous to have an end of it. And although I cannot answer for the success of the war, yet if the House will enable the king to come into the field with a good army, they may be able to preserve Flanders. (Grey, 364)</blockquote>In spring 1694 Tollemache was commanded to lead an expedition to Brest, the home of the French Atlantic Fleet. The expedition was plagued by delays and by 1 May it was common knowledge that he was to lead an expedition &#145;to plunder the French seaside towns&#146;  (Luttrell, <span class="italic">Brief Historical Relation</span>, 3.304). In early May, Louis dispatched the engineer Vauban to Brest to improve the defences. Not only did the French know of his plans for Brest, but Tollemache knew of the French preparations for his reception before he left Spithead. He wrote to Whitehall for further instructions but did not receive a reply before his departure at the end of the month. He also wrote to his brother, Lord Huntingtower, to say that he had been &#145;resolv'd to goe Live in the country the rest of my life, but my ill fortune will not let me alone, and now I am ingag'd more than ever, I must say much against my will&#146;  (Tollemache, 81). He expected, he wrote, to return in a month and then to be posted back to Flanders.<h2>
<a name="CamaretBay"></a>Camaret Bay</h2>The English fleet anchored in Camaret Bay on 7 June 1694. The French were found to be &#145;much better prepared on all sides, with Mortars, Guns and Men, than we expected&#146;  (Caermarthen, 15). A council of war was called for the next morning, and Tollemache outlined his plans to land troops on the Qu&eacute;lern peninsula under covering fire from the fleet. Once the defences had been overrun on the south side of the Goulet, the narrow stretch of water that connects the Rade de Brest to Camaret Bay, the fleet would be able to pass through the Goulet and bombard Brest. According to Burnet &#145;the Council and Officers were all against making the attempt; but <i>Talmash</i> had set his heart so much upon it, that he could not be diverted from it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 4.227).<br>
<br>It took all morning of 8 June 1694 for Lord Carmarthen to position his ships and Tollemache was not able to give orders for the landing until noon, by which time it was clear that the fire from the warships was ineffectual against the French defences. He nevertheless sent towards the landing beach a flotilla of small boats led by his major-general, Lord Cutts. As the boats neared the shore they were met by heavy fire; the assault stalled, and in the moment of hesitation Tollemache had his boat rowed to within shouting distance of that carrying Cutts. &#145;My lord,&#146; shouted Tollemache, &#145;is this following of orders? Do you see how the boats are in disorder? Pray, my lord, let us land in as good order as we can&#146;  (Childs, <span class="italic">William III</span>, 233). Cutts sent some of his men after his commanding officer, but remained afloat. To set an example Tollemache reached the shore, and with Captain Nathaniel Green and nine men made it to the cover of a large rock. Any further advance was prevented by the 150 French musketeers positioned further up the beach. Tollemache led his second wave of 150 grenadiers against this position. Most of his men were shot down, and he was shot in the thigh. He retreated until a further 200 men were landed, and led a second attack, but again the fire from the batteries and the musketeers was too fierce and most of them did not make it back to cover. Tollemache called for more men to land, but was persuaded to retreat to the boats once a body of French cavalry appeared along the shore. He was lifted into a boat and, still under heavy fire, was rowed to safety. Three hundred soldiers were lost in the raid.<br>
<br>Tollemache held one last council of war in which it was decided that the fleet should return to England. He reached Plymouth on the <i>Dreadnought</i> on 11 June 1694, where he was seen by surgeons. The prognosis was good, but in the afternoon of 12 June his leg<blockquote>was to a prodigious bigness swell'd from the Wound up to the Groyne, &amp; so downward to the Anckle. &hellip; Cap Green told him he fear'd it was death, the generall answer'd God's will be done, I beleeve the same &hellip; and about 7 a Clock hee dyed in Captn Green's Armes being sensible to the last. (Tollemache, 80)</blockquote>&#145;Before he died the general asserted it was impossible to have served their majesties better unless he had been obeyed, because none of the general officers landed with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 184).<br>
<br>Tollemache was &#145;much lamented&#146;  (Luttrell, <span class="italic">Brief Historical Relation</span>, 3.329), and although it was planned to bury him in Westminster Abbey his wish to be buried at home was respected. On 30 June 1694 he was laid in the family vault at Helmingham where an elaborate memorial was erected and still stands. Tollemache never married, but left in his will provision for his son &#145;Lt-Coll Wilkins's ensign, commonly called Thomas Tolmach&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>At his funeral Tollemache was described as &#145;a true Englishman&#146;  (Brady, 23). Bishop Burnet remembered him as &#145;a brave and generous man, and a good officer, very apt to animate and encourage inferior officers and soldiers, but he was much too apt to be discontented and to turn mutinous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 4.228). Tollemache's family and supporters were left with the unpleasant suspicion that he had died in consequence of &#145;the envy of some of his pretended friends&#146;  (memorial) who had either warned the French of the attack or had failed him in its execution. Whatever the truth of those suspicions it is clear that at Camaret Bay Tollemache had again defied those laws of war and policy referred to by Mackay, and had sacrificed himself and his men in an attack on a strong and well-prepared position. &#145;I am indeed extremely affected with the loss of poor Tollemache&#146;, wrote King William when he received the news, &#145;although I do not approve of his conduct, yet I am of opinion that his too ardent zeal to distinguish himself induced him to attempt what was impracticable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private and Original Correspondence of &hellip; Shrewsbury</span>, 199).<br>
