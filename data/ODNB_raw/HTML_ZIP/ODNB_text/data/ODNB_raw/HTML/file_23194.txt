<span class="headword">Rawlinson, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1647, <em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was baptized in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, London, on 1 April 1647, the second son of Daniel Rawlinson (1614&#150;1679), and his wife, Margaret Pever (<i>d</i>. 1666). His father was a London vintner who kept The Mitre tavern in Fenchurch Street. Young Rawlinson followed his father's business; he was admitted a freeman of the Vintners' Company on 12 October 1670, and emulating his father, later served as master, in 1687 and in 1696. In 1680 he married Mary (1661/2&#150;1725), eldest daughter of Richard Taylor of Turnham Green, who kept the Devil tavern by the Temple. They had fifteen children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23195/', "Thomas Rawlinson (1681&#150;1725)")</script>, a noted book collector, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23192/', "Richard Rawlinson (1690&#150;1755)")</script>, antiquarian and likewise a noted collector of manuscripts and books. Shortly after marriage, the couple moved to the Old Bailey, which remained the principal family residence for the rest of Rawlinson's life.<br>
<br>Rawlinson first entered public life as a common councillor for Farringdon Without in 1683, and two years later was a juror in the tory-orchestrated trial of Henry Cornish. Under James II Rawlinson emerged as an important figure in the capital, both in political and business circles. In 1685 he gained election to the committee of the East India Company, on which he served to 1689, at which time he held &pound;3750 stock. He later held a seat on the board in 1690&#150;92, 1693&#150;8, and 1700&#150;07, and was a manager of the united East India trade in 1703&#150;5. His tory loyalties were rewarded with appointment to the aldermanic bench in April 1686, and further honours duly followed. On 6 August 1686 he was knighted at Windsor, and in the following month was appointed sheriff of London and Middlesex by the king. However, he was removed as alderman in September 1687, presumably for giving less than wholehearted backing for the king's controversial religious policies. Despite this personal setback he remained loyal to the throne, and at the height of the revolution of 1688 defied the City whigs when they moved to send a laudatory address to William, prince of Orange, proposing instead that thanks be sent to James II for his return to London.<br>
<br>Although reviled by the whigs for his association with the discredited Stuart regime, Rawlinson proved a loyal subject under William, whom he later described as &#145;a gracious King&#146;  (Rawlinson letters 63, fol. 10<i>v</i>). He served as a common councillor in 1688&#150;9, made two substantial loans to the government, and was appointed a colonel of the City's newly raised auxiliary forces during the invasion scare of July 1690. He regained a seat on the aldermanic bench in December 1696, and in the same year was appointed a commissioner for the abortive land bank. Under Anne, his civic honours multiplied, he being appointed a colonel of the White regiment on 21 June 1705. Three months later he became president of Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals, and the following Michaelmas day was chosen lord mayor. During his mayoralty the City celebrated Marlborough's victories in Flanders, and at Rawlinson's request, the queen presented the trophies and colours taken at Ramillies and other engagements to be hung in the Guildhall. His surviving papers reflect the meticulous care with which he performed his public duties, and he was later celebrated for being &#145;easy and sedate&#146;  (Rawlinson MSS, D862, fols. 90&#150;91) in the mayoral chair.<br>
<br>Rawlinson died on 9 November 1708 at his house in the Old Bailey, and was buried on 18 November in the church of St Dionis, in the tomb of his father. His will, dated 20 January 1700, suggests a considerable personal fortune, listing properties in Warwickshire, London, Essex, and Lancashire. His widow twice remarried, and was buried in St Dionis Backchurch on 1 March 1725.<br>
<br>Rawlinson's kinsman, <a name="cosubject_23196"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Rawlinson</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1769), also served as <span class="occ">lord mayor of London</span>. He was son of the Revd Robert Rawlinson (1680&#150;1747) of Charlwood, Surrey, and his wife, Margaret Ray (<i>b</i>. 1677). His grandfather Daniel Rawlinson was the first Sir Thomas Rawlinson's first cousin. By 1735 he had married his first cousin Dorothea (1704&#150;1743), daughter of the Revd Richard Ray of Haughley, Suffolk; he soon established himself as one of the City's most prominent grocers. He was elected a common councillor in 1741&#150;4, alderman of Broad Street ward in 1746, and sheriff of London and Middlesex two years later. He rose rapidly within the Grocers' Company, and in 1746&#150;7 served the office of master. On the death, on 27 November 1753, of lord mayor Edward Ironside, Rawlinson took the chair for the remainder of the year. He was knighted in 1760, was colonel of the Red regiment of trained bands from 1762 to his death, and was a prominent member of the Honourable Artillery Company, to which he presented in 1763 a &#145;sheet of red colours&#146;. He was elected vice-president of the company in July 1766 and held the presidency of St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1767 to his death. He lived latterly at his estate of Stowlangtoft Hall in Suffolk, which he bought in 1760, but died at his house in Fenchurch Street, London, on 3 December 1769, his body being returned to Suffolk for burial at Haughley. His son, Sir Walter Rawlinson, inherited his Suffolk estates and married Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Ladbroke, lord mayor of London; they had no children. Walter Rawlinson became a partner in the banking firm of Ladbroke, Robinson, and Parker. He was elected alderman of Dowgate in 1773, and resigned in 1777. He was also president of Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals in 1773&#150;7, was knighted in 1774, and represented Queenborough in parliament from 1774 to 1784, and Huntingdon from 1784 to 1790. He died at Devonshire Place, London, on 13 March 1805.<br>
