<span class="headword">Cummins,  Geraldine Dorothy</span>  (1890&#150;1969), <span class="occ">writer and medium</span>, was born on 24 January 1890 at 17 St Patrick's Place, Cork city, the fifth of eleven children of Dr (William E.) Ashley Cummins, physician, and his wife, Jane Constable, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall (<i>d</i>. 1944). She was educated by a governess. She became active in the suffrage movement, and was appointed honorary treasurer of the Munster Women's Franchise League in 1911. She made a number of public speeches in favour of the cause, and through the league became a friend of the writer Edith Somerville. She recalled of this period: &#145;My advocacy of &#147;Votes for Women&#148; led to my being stoned through the streets of my native city by [the] sweated factory workers whose cause I so ardently espoused&#146;  (Cummins, 18).<br>
<br>Cummins pursued a literary career along with her suffrage activities. With her friend Susanne Rouviere Day she wrote two plays for the Abbey Theatre, <span class="italic">Broken Faith</span> (1914) and the comedy <span class="italic">Fox and Geese</span> (1917). W. B. Yeats attended the rehearsals of <span class="italic">Broken Faith</span>, and Cummins treasured his comment &#145;When I read your tragedy I thought it was written by two men, and am astonished to find that it was written by two women. It has a strength and directness that are masculine qualities&#146;  (Cummins, 88). She published two novels, <span class="italic">The Land they Loved</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">Fires of Beltane</span> (1936), both of which displayed her continuing concern with women's roles. Her short stories appeared in <span class="italic">Pall Mall</span>, and in 1959 she published a volume of them as <span class="italic">Variety Show</span>. Her biography of Edith Somerville (1952) is of little literary merit; her own autobiography, <span class="italic">Unseen Adventures</span>, appeared in 1951. Cummins's estimation of her literary talents was low, and she described herself as &#145;slow of speech&#146;, and as a &#145;dull uninformed conversationalist&#146;  (Cummins, 48&#150;9).<br>
<br>Cummins's principal interest, however, was in psychic phenomena. In June 1914 she had visited Paris with Susanne Day, where they met the psychic Hester Dowden and joined in a ouija board session. On returning to Ireland, Cummins left Cork for Dublin, where she took a job at the National Library of Ireland and became a paying guest in Mrs Dowden's house. Dowden apparently trained her in mediumship, and Cummins became less active in the suffrage cause; at this time she &#145;abandoned the idea of becoming a politician, it has not seemed to my mind at any time since, as humanly constructive an occupation as that of medium&#146;  (Cummins, 11). In 1923 she met Edith Beatrice Gibbes, who became her patron, and Cummins moved to Chelsea to live with Gibbes, returning to Cork each summer to visit her mother. After her arrival in London she began to produce a series of scripts through automatic writing which were later published. One series, apparently from the time of Jesus, was dictated by an early Christian called Cleophas, while a second series, begun in 1935 and finished in 1951, described the fate of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, who had disappeared in South America in 1925. During the Second World War, she received while in a trance a message for President Roosevelt, which she sent to the American embassy.<br>
<br>Beatrice Gibbes died in December 1951, leaving her house in Chelsea to Cummins, who continued to live there but spent increasing amounts of time in Ireland. Cummins died of cancer at Lindville Hospital, Cork, on 25 August 1969, and was buried in St Lappan's churchyard on Little Island in Cork.<br>
