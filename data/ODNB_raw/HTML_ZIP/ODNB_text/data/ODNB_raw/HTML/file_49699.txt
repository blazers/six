<span class="headword">Baker <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wakelin]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1736/7&#150;1816), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born in London, the daughter of Ann Wakelin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clark (<i>d</i>. 1787), an acrobatic dancer and troupe manager at Sadler's Wells, and James Wakelin (<i>fl</i>. 1749&#150;1779), a minor actor. With her sister Mary, she performed as a dancer in her mother's company at Sadler's Wells and on tour in Norwich, Yarmouth, and Bristol. Sarah was also a puppeteer, and Mrs Wakelin's company was regularly fined at Stourbridge fair, Cambridge, between 1762 and 1777, for offering rope-dancing, slack wire, puppet shows, and pantomime. Some time before 1761 Sarah married a Mr Baker, an acrobat in the Wakelin troupe, who may have been the famous clown-tumbler Polander. She had three children, Ann, Henry, and Sarah, before her husband's death about 1769.<br>
<br>Sarah assumed the management of the Sadler's Wells company, first noted at Canterbury, with rope-dancing, tumbling, musical interludes, burlettas, and all the clothes, scenery, and machinery &#145;entirely new&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kentish Gazette</span>, 19 Nov 1772). The values of the fairground and family touring group were thoroughly instilled in Sarah:<blockquote>When Mrs. Baker (who had many years previously only employed actors and actresses of cherry-wood, holly, oak, or ebony, and dressed and undressed both the ladies and gentlemen herself), first engaged a living company, she not only used to beat the drum behind the scenes, in Richard, and other martial plays, but was occasionally her own prompter. (Dibdin, 1.96&#150;7)</blockquote>Mrs Baker's touring circuit took in Dover, Canterbury, Rochester, Faversham, and Tunbridge Wells, as well as occasional visits to Folkestone, Deal, Sandwich, Lewes, and Sittingbourne. The acting company included many family members: her mother, until her retirement in 1777, her sister Mary, her own children, Ann, Henry, and Sarah, and her cousins the Irelands, some of whom were musicians for the company. She also employed many successful popular entertainers, such as the clown Lewy Owen. A playbill for the 1770s at Bartholomew fair advertises Mrs Baker's company at the Greyhound Yard Theatre, performing Charles Dibdin's ballad opera <span class="italic">The Waterman</span>, with Rugg as Waterman, Connell as Bundle, Lewy Owen as Robin, Miss Heydon as Mrs Bundle and Miss Wakelin as Wilhelmina. The afterpiece was <span class="italic">Harlequin's Whim, or, The Mery Medly</span>, with Douglas as Harlequin, Rugg as Lover, and Mrs Baker herself as Columbine.<br>
<br>After her mother's retirement, in 1778, Sarah started to offer plays, both comedy and tragedy, as well as fairground or variety entertainment. Her acting company gave a start to performers like <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7993/', "William Dowton (1764&#150;1851)")</script>, who joined in 1791 and married her daughter Sarah (1768&#150;1817) in 1794, and was an early employer of Thomas Dibdin and Edmund Kean. Part of the attraction, as Dibdin recalled, was the offer of a regular salary, &#145;not a joint-stock concern&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.91&#150;2), as many other touring managements were. As the company's reputation for serious drama became more established, Sarah and her actor-cum-stage manager Jem Gardner, and later her prompter, Bony Long, tempted such leading London performers as Charles Incledon, George F. Cooke, Dorothy Jordan, and Joseph Grimaldi into occasional, lucrative engagements.<br>
<br>The repertory Sarah offered included several Shakespeare plays; <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, and <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> were offered at least once a week during the 1780s, in addition to comic opera and topical interludes, often with local comment, as in Thomas Dibdin's afterpiece <span class="italic">The Merry Hop-Pickers, or, Kentish Frolicks</span>. Other favourites were Cumberland's <span class="italic">The West Indian</span> and <span class="italic">The Brother</span> and Mrs Inchbald's <i>&#339;uvre</i>. By 1795 the Baker company's repertory was very considerable, and Sarah was advertising pieces direct from London and &#145;diversity of nouvelle matter&#146;  (Hodgson, 76). The success of her policy of celebrity recruitment and an up-to-date repertory maximizing the taste of her provincial audiences was indicated by the returns Joseph Grimaldi recorded for playing Scaramouche in <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> for a couple of nights in Maidstone and Canterbury in March 1802. Sarah split the house takings with Grimaldi, after charges, and he netted a very healthy &pound;311 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for four days' work.<br>
<br>Successful touring managements like Sarah Baker's were often responsible for building permanent provincial theatres in the major towns on their circuits. Her will lists her theatres in the five main circuit towns and small theatres in Folkestone and in Ore, near Hastings. In Canterbury she built her &#145;great grand theatre&#146;  (Hodgson, 70) in 1789 at a cost of &pound;3000 after she had seen off the challenge of a rival manager, Hurst, whose disastrous management dissipated his initial success. However, rivals were not always so easily defeated. At Margate Sarah ran into considerable difficulties with the company run by Charles Mate. Mate had already failed in his attempts to oust her at Dover and Rochester, as he complained in a letter to Winston: &#145;Mrs Beaker &hellip; who had got possession of some of my Inland Towns enved me my little Margate Retret&#146;  (ibid., 69). Baker had rented a converted stable from a local banker and magistrate, Mr Cobb. In 1784 Baker wanted to build a better theatre in Margate, but Cobb refused:<blockquote>whereupon the gentle fair one entered a remonstrance, and declared her right to murder Shakespear equally with Mate; and told him, for all he was a Justice, she would build in spite of him. Accordingly the following year produced a Baker's company, who exercised their calling near the church, and instituted a theatrical warfare. (Winston, 12)</blockquote>Cobb and Mate then hatched a plan to establish a patent at Margate, which project garnered support from the local freemasons and nobility and passed, at great expense, through both houses of parliament. With fewer resources than Cobb and Mate, Sarah conceded defeat. She struck her temporary wooden theatre and moved it wholesale to Faversham. However, she learned a valuable lesson, and in Rochester, where she had occupied her newly built Theatre Royal, Star Hill, since 1791, she herself applied in 1798 for a royal patent in order to force the local JPs to grant her a licence after rioting by nearby Chatham sailors had caused her existing licence to be cancelled. In Tunbridge Wells her aspirations to have a permanent house brought her into conflict with Glassington's company at Hunt's Warehouse. But here she had the support of significant local patrons, and she erected a new theatre &#145;at the request of several of her friends &hellip; securing it by lease&#146;  (ibid., 16), where she remained unmolested until she upgraded the theatre to a &pound;60 capacity, at a cost of &pound;1600, in 1802. All of the new theatres were simple, rectangular buildings, with pit, boxes, and an upper gallery, and similar dimensions to allow scenery to be directly transferred. The theatres had only one entrance, past the box office, where Sarah herself took money for all the seats. In the larger towns she also built dwelling houses connected to the theatres, which were let out of season.<br>
<br>Sarah's management style was combative. Dibdin noted her &#145;usual rapidity of utterance&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.102) and, when provoked, her use of &#145;lingual expression more idiomatic of Peckham-fair technicals than the elegance to be expected from a directress of the British drama&#146;  (ibid., 1.94). Her hard-headed financial sense was tempered towards her company members, who record regular payment in full and guaranteed accommodation at reasonable rates. &#145;She owned an excellent heart, with much of the appearance and manners of a gentlewoman&#146;  (ibid., 1.94), and she occasionally bartered toys for tickets with local children. Sarah passed over the management of the highly successful company to William Dowton in June 1815. She died in Rochester, Kent, on 20 February 1816 and was buried in Rochester Cathedral churchyard. Her will left approximately &pound;16,000 in investment and property, in carefully secured trust funds. As Dibdin's epitaph on her gravestone records:<blockquote>
<div>If industry have claim to moral worth;<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; then she, whose frame<br>
</div>
<div>Decays beneath, with humble hope may aim<br>
</div>
<div>At happiness to come. Alone, untaught,<br>
</div>
<div>And self-assisted, (save by Heaven) she sought<br>
</div>
<div>To render each his own, and fairly save<br>
</div>
<div>What might help others when she found a grave.<br>
</div>
