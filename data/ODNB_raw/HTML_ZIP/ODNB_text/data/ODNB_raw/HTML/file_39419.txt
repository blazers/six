<span class="headword">Macmillan family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1840&#150;1986), <span class="occ">publishers</span>, began as Scottish farmers and came to prominence when two brothers, <a name="cosubject_17694"></a><span class="headword">Daniel Macmillan</span>  (1813&#150;1857)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_39419"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Macmillan</span>  (1818&#150;1896)<span class="occ"></span>, entered the London publishing world in the early 1840s. The original family seat appears to have been Dunmore, in Argyll, where a tongue of land known as North Knapdale belonged to the clan. At the end of the seventeenth or early in the eighteenth century the family migrated to the island of Arran off the western Scottish coast.<h2>
<a name="Earlyhistory"></a>Early history</h2>About Daniel Macmillan, great-grandfather of Daniel and Alexander Macmillan, little is known other than that he was industrious and staunchly religious. His son, Malcolm, was described as a kindly man, although austere; at some point he moved his family to Cork farm, where they continued for thirty years. He served as an elder in the established church. Of his ten children, the two eldest sons served on board the king's cutter in the preventive service, and a third, Duncan (1770&#150;1823), married Katherine Crawford (1772&#150;1835) and inherited a small farm in Upper Corrie on the island of Arran from his father-in-law. It was here that Daniel Macmillan was born, on 13 September 1813. In or about 1816, however, Duncan Macmillan moved his family, which would eventually consist of twelve children, to Irvine in Ayrshire on the Scottish mainland, and Alexander Macmillan was born here on 3 October 1818. At times Duncan Macmillan kept cattle and cultivated a small portion of land; at others he was a carter, usually carrying coal from the pits to the Irvine harbour. He was kind to children, cared greatly for his family, and was deeply religious.<br>
<br>Although Daniel was but nine and Alexander only four when their father died, they ever after remembered and honoured his memory. Henceforth, they would look to their elder brothers, Malcolm (<i>d</i>. 1840) and William (<i>d</i>. 1838) for guidance and kindness. It was the boys' mother, however, who was to have the greatest influence over their lives, particularly Daniel's. Although there is no record of her education, she was literate, reading to them from her <span class="roman">Bible</span> and teaching them from strong religious principles. She also had a pleasantly musical voice with which she sang native ballads and hymns to her children by the hearthside. Almost forty years after her death Alexander wrote: &#145;She had a very noble sweet nature and a certain serenity and clearness of mind that I have hardly ever met with in any other human being&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Alexander Macmillan</span>, 6).<br>
<br>With no education beyond that which four or five years at the village school could provide, along with what he gleaned from <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading, Daniel nevertheless set out to make his way in life through the world of books. On 1 January 1824, at the age of ten, he bound himself to Maxwell Dicks, an Irvine bookseller and bookbinder, for a &#145;wage of 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per week for the first year, with a rise of 1<i>s</i>. a week for each of the remaining six years&#146;  (Hughes, 5). His contract was completed successfully on 14 February 1831, with high recommendations from his employer. He next went to Glasgow to work in Mr Atkinson's bookshop, a fine business in the literary heart of the city. This promising career was to be interrupted, however, by the onset of severe illness which left him coughing up blood, and required him to return to Irvine for nursing by his mother. This was the first manifestation of the tuberculosis which would ultimately kill him.<br>
<br>Even before his recovery Daniel was exploring, with his Glasgow friend James MacLehose who had by then moved to London, the possibility of finding a situation for himself in the metropolis. By September 1833 he was well enough to travel, and spent a few days in London where he was unable to find suitable employment. At length he compromised and accepted an offer from a Mr Johnson of Cambridge to work in his shop at an annual salary of &pound;30. Daniel would be able to board with the Johnsons and attend Baptist church services with the family. Here he remained for the next three years, his salary inching up to &pound;35 in the third, while he mastered the business, made valuable contacts among Cambridge dons, and lost no opportunity to read widely as he pursued a programme of self-education. Still he longed to make the leap to London. In the absence of an offer he took ship to Scotland but on the voyage, through exposure to the cold, he became seriously ill. He stopped in Edinburgh, where the mother of his friend George Wilson nursed him in her home. Finally, through the intervention of MacLehose, he received an offer to work at Messrs Seeley in Fleet Street at &pound;60 per year.<br>
<br>Meanwhile his younger brother Alexander was floundering. It is a confusing time in his history and solid facts are few. He taught at various country schools in the Irvine neighbourhood, including a three-month stint where he filled in for the headmaster at Scott's School, at the age of fifteen or sixteen. Later he worked as assistant to George Gallio, a bookseller in Glasgow, but left, disgusted at his employer's disapproval of novel-reading. For a while he worked for a Mr Atkinson in Glasgow. At one point he considered entering either the medical or the nautical profession. In 1836 disillusionment and despair caused him to become a sailor and ship to America, at the end of which time he landed back in Glasgow, penniless. Finally, owing to Daniel's success at Seeleys, the firm agreed to extend an offer to Alexander, also at &pound;60; he arrived to take up his duties on 3 October 1839, his twenty-first birthday. Henceforth the brothers' partnership in the book business remained unbroken until Daniel's death in 1857.<h2>
<a name="DanielandAlexandergettingstarted"></a>Daniel and Alexander: getting started</h2>Both Macmillan brothers were now well positioned in London. They were hard workers, and gave satisfaction to their employers, but were also ambitious and looking for new opportunity. Realizing that their lack of formal education was a handicap, they seized every spare moment to read widely, in the classics and among such authors as P. B. Shelley, Thomas Carlyle, and Alexander Scott. Scott brought Daniel into correspondence with Julius Charles Hare, archdeacon of Lewes, and this resulted in a friendship which would later prove most useful. Hare introduced Daniel to F. D. Maurice, the Christian socialist, who became one of the Macmillans' closest associates.<br>
<br>By the autumn and winter of 1842 the Macmillan brothers began to think of establishing their own bookshop, together with a small publishing house. In February 1843 they occupied space at 57 Aldersgate Street and their first two titles were published later the same year: <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Training</span> by A. R. Craig, and <span class="italic">The Three Questions: What Am I? Whence Came I? And Whither do I Go?</span> by William Haig Miller, the latter published for the Religious Tract Society. The first work dealt with training for teachers of the middle class, while the latter took a hopeful view of mankind's destiny. These early books established trends in Macmillan publishing philosophy which would influence their lists far into the future: sincere interest in education and profound religious belief.<br>
<br>Once established, the Macmillans moved swiftly. With the help of a loan of &pound;500 from Archdeacon Hare, the brothers purchased, also in 1843, the bookshop of a Mr Newby at 17 Trinity Street, Cambridge; the plan was for Daniel to preside over the Cambridge shop while Alexander remained in London. In the end this was not feasible and by late in the year both brothers settled in Cambridge. By 1845 the opportunity arose to purchase, from Thomas Stevenson, a larger shop, in a better location, which was prestigious for having been established in the eighteenth century. To do so they had to take the distasteful step of acquiring a partner, a Mr Barclay, a wholesale druggist, who invested &pound;6000, despite knowing nothing about either the book or the publishing business. Temporarily the firm became Macmillan, Barclay, and Macmillan, but later, when they retired the debt, it quickly reverted to Macmillan &amp; Co.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>During the years 1845&#150;57 the Macmillan brothers laid the foundation for the future of the company. Their list addressed serious subjects, such as education, Christianity, and classical literature, but was also early in recognizing growing public interest in science and mathematics. Because of their location in a university town they published syllabuses for Cambridge courses, educational guides and companions, and handbooks for student use such as <span class="italic">A Short and Easy Course of Algebra</span> (1850), <span class="italic">Arithmetic: Rules and Reasons</span> (1850) by J. H. Boardman, and <span class="italic">Arithmetic Examples</span> (1851). In fact, by 1852, of the 131 titles so far published by Macmillan, seventy-five, or three-fifths, concerned either Cambridge scholarship or Cambridge classes. Libraries in the various Cambridge colleges offered opportunities for publishing bibliographies and lists of manuscript collections. Contemporary events, such as the death of the duke of Wellington, prompted publication of numerous sermons and sonnets reflecting on his great service to the nation. During this time of conservative growth, and despite a severely limited list, Macmillan was very early in finding places for two books by women: <span class="italic">Hours of Reflection</span> (1845) by Ellen Taylor Hudson and <span class="italic">Sketches of Character</span> (1849) by Anna T. Potts. The young firm also took considerable risk in publishing such periodicals as the <span class="italic">Cambridge Mathematical Journal</span> (1846); the <span class="italic">Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology</span> (1854); and <span class="italic">Academia: an Occasional Journal</span> (1858). These were not successful ventures, largely because the firm had not enough capital to sustain the journals until they achieved sufficient circulation to pay for themselves.<br>
<br>Because the Macmillans had a clear understanding of the importance of the personal element in publishing, they saw to it that 1 Trinity Street was a place for easy and convivial exchange of ideas. They cultivated acquaintance with both university dons and townspeople, and welcomed bright young students, all of whom were free to meet for conversation in an upper common room reserved for that purpose. They also began a practice, which continued through the years, of offering generous terms to their authors. Three maxims&#151;interest in education, belief in religion, and generosity in business&#151;became the bedrock of the Macmillan family company.<br>
<br>By 1850, with business prospering, the Macmillan brothers contemplated marriage. Frances Eliza Orridge (1821&#150;1867), the daughter of a chemist who was also a Cambridge magistrate, became Daniel's wife on 4 September 1850, and Alexander married Caroline Brimley (<i>d</i>. 1871), eldest sister of his friend George Brimley, librarian of Trinity College, on 15 August 1851. The first Macmillan union produced four children: <a href="#cosubject_34798">Frederick Orridge Macmillan [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Maurice Crawford (1853&#150;1936), Katherine (<i>b</i>. 1855), and Arthur (1857&#150;1876). Alexander and his wife had five children: Malcolm Kingsley (1852&#150;1889), George Augustin (1855&#150;1936), Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1857), Olive (<i>b</i>. 1859), and William Alexander (1864&#150;1966).<br>
<br>In F. D. Maurice, whom Alexander referred to as their prophet, the Macmillans found their first truly prolific author. Maurice, professor of English literature and modern history at King's College, London, chaplain of Guy's Hospital, London, and author of the influential <span class="italic">Kingdom of Christ</span> (1838), was a well-known figure in academic circles. He appeared on Macmillan's list initially in 1844 with an introduction to a reprint edition of Mandeville's <span class="italic">Fable of the Bees</span> (1714). He wrote three items each in 1853 and 1854 and fifteen publications in 1855. These were largely either collections of sermons or long open letters on topics of current importance. While the Macmillans had no intention of allowing their list to become top-heavy with one author or one subject, they also knew that Maurice was an influential figure in Cambridge who might well serve as a magnet to draw other scholars to the young firm. This he certainly did, but perhaps his greatest contribution was to introduce his publishers to Charles Kingsley, rector of Eversley, in Hampshire, and a former pupil of Maurice.<br>
<br>Using the pseudonym Parson Lot, Kingsley was first published by Macmillan in 1850 in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Cheap Clothes and Nasty</span>, in which he attacked the shocking working conditions in the London tailors' trade. <span class="italic">Phaeton, or, Loose Thoughts for Loose Thinkers</span> (1852) was next to appear, followed by his lectures <span class="italic">Alexandria and her Schools</span> (1854), originally delivered to the Philosophical Institution of Edinburgh. His fascination with marine biology led to the very successful <span class="italic">Glaucus, or, Wonders of the Shore</span> (1855) which was reprinted ten times by 1887. Kingsley brought excellent profits from his work but he was also responsible for a major shift in publishing policy when the firm brought out his <span class="italic">Westward Ho!</span> (1855), Macmillan's first venture into fiction. That Daniel was cognizant of the influence of Mudie's circulating library in determining the success of novels is shown by his assurance to Kingsley that Mudie would advertise <span class="italic">Westward Ho!</span> in both London and Manchester newspapers to ensure that other libraries would buy it. An Elizabethan romance, it introduced the notion of &#145;muscular Christianity&#146; and was intended as a spur to Victorian society to fight the evils in its midst. That it coincided with Victorian dismay and disenchantment over conduct of the Crimean War only added to its message and it became a best-seller. As a three-decker, it had an initial print-run of 2000 (500 more than usual); the 6<i>s</i>. edition sold 50,000 copies by 1880; and the 6<i>d</i>. edition of 1889 sold 500,000 copies. <span class="italic">The Water-Babies</span> (1863) was equally popular and earned huge profits for the firm.<br>
<br>The Macmillans were fortunate to find another popular novelist, Thomas Hughes, also a good friend, to continue the novel tradition. Hughes proposed a book based on a schoolboy's exploits at Rugby when Thomas Arnold was headmaster. <span class="italic">Tom Brown's School Days</span> (1857), first published anonymously, sold 11,000 copies (at a time when the usual first printing was 1500) before the year's end, with a sixth edition appearing in 1858. The new policy of publishing fiction proved enormously profitable for both the Macmillans and their authors.<h2>
<a name="DanielsdeathAlexandersnewresponsibilities"></a>Daniel's death: Alexander's new responsibilities</h2>Daniel and Alexander complemented one another smoothly as a team. The older brother was restless, always seeking new opportunities, pushing for excellence. While Alexander was not lacking in these qualities, he was more stolid, very intuitive about the business, and congenial in society. Unfortunately, all through the 1840s and 1850s Daniel suffered recurring health problems. It was in 1841 that consumptive symptoms first overtook him, and early in 1844, shortly after he moved to Cambridge to supervise the business, he suffered a violent haemorrhage and was forced to spend time recuperating. Because the brothers worked unusually long hours at the shop, and sometimes denied themselves even modest comforts, Daniel's health broke down time after time, forcing him to go to Torquay for sea air and rest. During his wedding journey in 1850 he suffered from the cold in Scotland and spent the final two weeks in Torquay resting and fighting his disease. There was a spell in 1855 that was particularly worrisome and left him a semi-invalid the rest of his life.<br>
<br>As Daniel's health weakened, more and more responsibility for building the Macmillan business fell on Alexander's shoulders. Their letters show that the younger brother was always careful to consult Daniel, but inevitably some decisions could not wait and the burdens and worries were borne by Alexander alone. Daniel's letters show his patience under suffering, but also his frustration that he could no longer be active in the business. On 7 May 1857 an attack of pleurisy added to his problems, and soon a throat ulcer left him unable either to eat or to drink. At length the blow fell, and Daniel died at his Cambridge home on 26 June 1857, after terrible suffering; he was buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge, on 1 July. His last child, Arthur, was not yet two months old. As Alexander contemplated the future, he saw clearly that it belonged to him for the present, but ultimately to the next generation, to Daniel's and his own sons, and from that moment he began to prepare.<br>
<br>Alexander's first thought was for Daniel's family, which he now took under his own roof, raising Daniel's children as his own. He was very compatible with his sister-in-law, Mrs Daniel, as he called her; she became valuable to him in business matters and he came to trust her judgement implicitly. Next he set about establishing a London branch of the company, a move Daniel had contemplated as early as 1852 but had been unable to accomplish. A nephew, Robert Bowes, was placed in charge of the premises at 23 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. With a new London headquarters, Alexander began his practice of coming to town on Thursdays to host an informal gathering of authors and friends, which came to be known as his &#145;Tobacco Parliaments&#146;. Men of such diverse tastes and talents as Alfred Tennyson, Herbert Spencer, T. H. Huxley, Francis Turner Palgrave, Coventry Patmore, F. D. Maurice, Charles Kingsley, and Thomas Hughes gathered for a light supper, followed by tobacco and spirits, to engage the topics of the day in this leisurely setting.<br>
<br>The imprint for Macmillan changed with the new location. &#145;Macmillan &amp; Co.&#146; now became either &#145;Cambridge: Macmillan &amp; Co.&#146;, or &#145;Cambridge: Macmillan &amp; Co. and 23 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London&#146;. Changes also occurred in the Macmillan list, reflecting both shifts in contemporary taste and the more metropolitan location. While books on education, religion, mathematics, sermons, and university affairs were never discontinued, new material was explored. David Masson's two works <span class="italic">Sketch of the British Novelists</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">The Life of John Milton</span> (1859) were the first examples of literary criticism, of which more would follow. James Clerk Maxwell's <span class="italic">Essay on the Stability of the Motion of Saturn's Rings</span> (1859) reflected the general public's growing interest in astronomy. Macmillan's first woman novelist appeared, Margaret Oliphant, writing <span class="italic">Agnes Hopetoun's Schools and Holidays: the Experiences of a Little Girl</span> (1859), as did an anonymous <span class="italic">Out of the Depths: the Story of a Woman's Life</span> (1859).<h2>
<a name="MacmillansMagazine"></a>Macmillan's Magazine</h2>A good deal of talk at the Tobacco Parliaments was given over to the possibility of Macmillan joining the trend of the 1850s among publishing houses and establishing a shilling magazine of its own. During the course of 1859 Alexander Macmillan, after careful consideration, decided to proceed, and the first issue of <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> appeared on 1 November 1859, with a celebratory dinner that evening at Henrietta Street. David Masson was the first editor and the following men contributed articles for the first number: Masson, Hughes, George Wilson, F. G. Stephens, Franklin Lushington, and J. M. Ludlow.<br>
<br>During the planning phase Alexander Macmillan's old friend Ludlow had argued forcefully that a publishing house with a journal, which could publish novels first serially and later in volume form, would vastly increase the profits to both author and publisher. Although acceptance as a serial did not automatically guarantee publication in book form, Macmillan did go on to publish many of his serials, such as Hughes's <span class="italic">Tom Brown at Oxford</span> (November 1859 &#150; July 1861); Charles Kingsley's <span class="italic">The Water-Babies</span> (August 1862 &#150; March 1863); Oliphant's <span class="italic">A Son of the Soil</span> (November 1863 &#150; April 1865); Charlotte Mary Yonge's <span class="italic">The Dove in the Eagle's Nest</span> (May 1865 &#150; December 1865); Anthony Trollope's <span class="italic">Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite</span> (May 1870 &#150; December 1870); William Black's <span class="italic">Strange Adventures of a Phaeton</span> (January 1872 &#150; November 1872); Annie Keary's <span class="italic">Castle Daly</span> (February 1874 &#150; July 1875); Henry James's <span class="italic">The Portrait of a Lady</span> (October 1880 &#150; November 1881); and Thomas Hardy's <span class="italic">The Woodlanders</span> (May 1886 &#150; February 1887). Royalties for serials were determined by the editor, while royalties for books were negotiated individually, determined to some degree by the previous popularity of the serial.<br>
<br>During its early years, 1859&#150;1874, <span class="italic">Macmillan's</span> was notable for the opportunities it offered to women journalists. In its first fifteen years sixty-three women made contributions, including 11 serials, 61 pieces of poetry, and 120 prose articles. Christina Rossetti was a steady contributor, as were Frances Power Cobbe, Dinah Maria Craik, the Hon. Mrs Caroline Norton, Lady (Lucie) Duff-Gordon, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and Octavia Hill. Even more importantly, the women wrote, not on fashion or cookery, but on substantial matters of the day, such as evolution, the death of Prince Albert, the American Civil War, justice for downtrodden Egyptians, education for women, and the Franco-Prussian War. Almost without exception the women boldly signed their names, contrary to contemporary custom.<h2>
<a name="Alexanderatmidlife"></a>Alexander at mid-life</h2>The years 1860 to 1872 were ones of enormous accomplishment for Alexander Macmillan, as he inaugurated one new publishing series after another, began new ventures, and moved the firm's headquarters from Cambridge to 16 Bedford Street, London. In doing so, he displayed a talent for innovation, although always tempered by a cautious business sense, and he built Macmillan into one of London's leading publishing houses.<br>
<br>Alexander Macmillan's interests were wide and varied. First and foremost, of course, was his responsibility for managing the business and overseeing its list of publications. His interest in things American led to his strong support for the North during the civil war. He worried about the problems of international copyright. When the publisher John W. Parker failed, he arranged to secure for Macmillan the already published early works of Kingsley, Maurice, Archbishop Trench, and C. M. Yonge. After moving the headquarters to London he took a spacious home in Upper Tooting, suitable for the two families under one roof, and named it Knapdale after the ancestral property. Here he was free to offer expansive hospitality, in the Macmillan tradition, to friends and authors. In 1863 Macmillan undertook some special projects for Oxford University, an appointment which continued until 1880, at which time he was awarded an honorary MA degree out of gratitude for his services.<br>
<br>One of Alexander Macmillan's foremost new ventures began with F. T. Palgrave's <span class="italic">Golden Treasury of the Best Songs and Lyrical Poems in the English Language</span> (1861), where the author brought together a selection of what he considered the best songs and poems. This technique served to encourage the growth of a new genre, the anthology. It is possible to argue with Palgrave's judgement; he rejected the poetry of John Donne, William Blake, and Emily Bront&euml;, and made only limited selections from the work of Coleridge, Henry Vaughan, Richard Crashaw, and George Herbert. But one cannot argue with the fact that this approach became enormously popular with the British public. Showing its chief's usual caution, Macmillan initially ordered a printing of only 2000 copies. Popular demand, however, was such that by 1888 there had been twenty-three new editions and reprints.<br>
<br>Sensing that this was an important new approach, Alexander Macmillan at once set out to commission new works in what became the <span class="roman">Golden Treasury</span> series. Some of the more popular selections, out of the many titles which eventually comprised the series, included Roundell Palmer's <span class="italic">Book of Praise</span> (1862); William Allingham's <span class="italic">Ballad Book</span> (1864); and C. M. Yonge's <span class="italic">Book of Golden Deeds of All Time</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Book of Thoughts</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Book of Worthies Gathered from Old Histories</span> (1869). Some enduring volumes in the series were Patmore's <span class="italic">Children's Garland</span> (1862), M. C. Aitken's <span class="italic">Scottish Song</span> (1874), Matthew Arnold's selections from William Wordsworth (1879) and Lord Byron (1881), and T. H. Ward's <span class="italic">The English Poets</span> (1880). Other books by Palgrave included <span class="italic">Songs and Sonnets by William Shakespeare</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Essays on Art</span> (1866), <span class="italic">Hymns</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Lyrical Poems</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">Chrysomela</span> (1877), a selection from the lyrics of Robert Herrick. (The last volume in this series was not published until 1961.)<br>
<br>A new venture, begun in 1864, was the <span class="italic">Statesman's Year Book</span>, first edited by Frederick Martin; it was a fresh concept which provided a &#145;statistical, genealogical, and historic account of the states and sovereigns of the civilized world&#146;  (VanArsdel, 183). It proved to be an invaluable political and diplomatic tool, which was still in publication at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In the mid-1860s, with business complexities mounting, Alexander Macmillan felt keenly the need for additional help he could rely on. His first step was to appoint a partner to the firm, whose job would be to supervise the day-to-day operations. For this post, after consulting with MacLehose, he chose a fellow Scotsman, George Lillie Craik, who came to work in 1865 and stayed, a valued and trusted employee, until he died in 1905. Next Macmillan drew about him a group of several men whose judgement he could trust to serve as advisers, people with whom he could consult on difficult questions. These included John Morley, George Grove, and Norman Lockyer. Nor was he idle himself. Among works he initiated or supported were Alexander Gilchrist's biography of the then-neglected poet William Blake (1863); William Allingham's <span class="italic">The Ballad Book</span> (1864); and the very popular <span class="italic">Jest Book</span> (1864) by Mark Lemon, featuring a collection of anecdotes and sayings. There was a selection of poetry suitable for children to read on Sundays by Mrs C. F. Alexander, <span class="italic">The Sunday Book of Poetry</span> (1864); and Alexander Smith's edition of Robert Burns (1865). In addition Macmillan began commissioning textbooks on botany, chemistry, and geology for children in elementary schools, in keeping with the firm's original commitment to education.<br>
<br>An important series of books for children and young adults began appearing in the 1860s, beginning with Georgina M. Craik's <span class="italic">My First Journal: a Book for the Young</span> and Dinah Maria Craik's <span class="italic">Our Year: a Child's Book in Prose and Verse</span> (both 1860). Westland Marston's novel <span class="italic">A Lady in her Own Right</span> (1860) was followed by more novels in 1861: May Beverley's <span class="italic">The Moor Cottage</span>; Oliver Wendell Holmes's <span class="italic">Elsie Venner</span>; and Hughes's <span class="italic">Tom Brown at Oxford</span>. In 1862 there were Arthur Hugh Clough's <span class="italic">Poems with a Memoir</span>, Christina Rossetti's <span class="italic">Goblin Market and other Poems</span>, and Caroline Norton's <span class="italic">The Lady of La Garaye</span>. J. E. Cairnes's <span class="italic">The Slave Power</span> (1863) attempted to analyse the issues behind the American Civil War. The first Macmillan book by Matthew Arnold appeared in 1864, <span class="italic">A French Eton</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Essays in Criticism</span> in 1865. Also in 1865, Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</span> was published, at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., complete with forty-two illustrations by John Tenniel: second, third, fourth, and fifth editions followed each year for the next four years. <span class="italic">Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</span> appeared in 1872, with fifty Tenniel illustrations, and was reprinted twelve times up to 1887. Carroll was a difficult author to deal with, being unusually fussy about textual matters, but Alexander Macmillan treated him with much understanding. He went to great lengths, repeatedly, to do Carroll personal favours, even procuring special pantomime tickets for the author's young relative. But the publisher's forbearance paid off, for Carroll had a long association with Macmillan, and gave the firm, among many works, such future successes as <span class="italic">The Hunting of the Snark</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">Alice's Adventures Underground</span> (1886).<br>
<br>Alexander Macmillan also proposed, in 1865, a series to be called the <span class="roman">Sunday Library for Household Reading</span> which would consist of children's books published in monthly parts. As editors he suggested two Macmillan readers for educational and devotional books, C. M. Yonge and Frances Martin. The first to appear were Yonge's <span class="italic">Pupils of St. John the Divine</span> (1868); George Macdonald's <span class="italic">Pioneers and Founders: England's Antiphon</span> (1868); and Annie Keary's <span class="italic">Nations Around</span> (1870). Other titles were by Kingsley, Hughes, Archdeacon Frederic William Farrar, and Mrs Oliphant.<br>
<br>The year 1867 marked a new enterprise for the company: after a visit to the United States, Alexander decided that a New York branch would be feasible. He sent George Brett to open it in 1869, who was so successful that two years later Frederick Macmillan, Daniel's eldest son, was sent to receive training there.<br>
<br>Alexander continued to be interested in the work of women, as first demonstrated in the 1840s, and was fortunate to secure the early work of a number who would later be prominent in the struggle for women's rights. Some of these works were Sophia Jex-Blake's <span class="italic">Some American Schools and Colleges</span> (1867); Josephine Butler's <span class="italic">The Education and Employment of Women</span> (1868); Harriet Martineau's <span class="italic">Biographical Sketches</span> (1869) and <span class="italic">A Letter to the Deaf</span> (1869); <span class="italic">Woman's Work and Woman's Culture</span> (1869) edited by Butler; and Millicent Garrett Fawcett's <span class="italic">Political Economy for Beginners</span> (1870). Although Lady (Mary Anne) Barker was not a women's rights activist she nevertheless produced an unexpected success in her <span class="italic">Station Life in New Zealand</span>, which went through four editions between 1870 and 1883, and was reprinted in 1887.<br>
<br>One of the jewels in the firm's crown, and a truly original project for its time, was due entirely to Alexander Macmillan's far-sighted vision. An uncommonly fine edition of <span class="italic">The Works of William Shakespeare</span> was being produced, under the general editorship of W. G. Clark, the public orator of Cambridge, and John Glover, the librarian of Trinity. Using, among other sources, the Capell collection of quartos housed in the library of Trinity College, eventually the project would grow to nine volumes, but when the first one appeared in 1863 it sparked Alexander Macmillan's thinking. Although the original edition, known as <span class="italic">The Cambridge Shakespeare</span>, was designed primarily for Shakespearian students and scholars, and unusual care had been taken with the textual editing, Macmillan saw it another way, as well. Why not a popular edition, using the same text, but priced for the general consumer? Thus was born the <span class="italic">Globe Shakespeare</span> (1864). The publisher described it as &#145;immeasurably the cheapest, most beautiful and handy book that has appeared of <i>any kind, except the</i> <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Alexander Macmillan</span>, 223), and ordered a first printing of 50,000 copies priced at 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. As with the <span class="roman">Golden Treasury</span> books, success of the first volume inspired another series produced similarly and sold cheaply for the general reading public. The format of large print and special size, the <span class="roman">Globe</span> octavo, and the popular price were retained to produce volumes on Robert Burns (1868), Oliver Goldsmith (1869), Alexander Pope (1869), Edmund Spenser (1869), William Cowper (1870), John Dryden (1870), Virgil (1871), Horace (1873), and Milton (1877).<h2>
<a name="Macmillanjournals"></a>Macmillan journals</h2>Although Macmillan &amp; Co. had no success with its first journals, in 1869, on the strong recommendation of Norman Lockyer, a respected astronomer and spectroscopist, the firm founded <span class="italic">Nature</span>, a weekly scientific paper designed to appeal to the general public as well as to offer a means for scientists to communicate with one another. It captured an audience because of growing interest in science among the lay population and also because it had the backing of such prominent Victorian scientists as Thomas Huxley, Charles Darwin, John Tyndall, and Henry Enfield Roscoe. Lockyer, the first editor, remained at his post for a remarkable fifty years (until 1919) and succeeded in building a journal respected worldwide. Other journals founded by Macmillan in the nineteenth century included: the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span> (1878); <span class="italic">Brain</span> (1878); and the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> (1891). A non-scientific journal, the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> (1883), coincided with the growing trend towards magazine illustration and was sustained by such leading illustrators as Hugh Thomson, A. D. McCormick, Herbert Railton, Joseph Pennell, and Walter Crane. Some of its contributors also published their work in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, including Henry James, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Rudyard Kipling, while others, such as George Meredith and Algernon Swinburne, contributed only to the illustrated publication. The first editor of the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> was Joseph William Comyns Carr, who was succeeded by Sir Clement Kinloch-Cooke; after ten years of dwindling circulation ownership was transferred to another publisher and it continued until 1913.<h2>
<a name="Publishingeventsofthe1870s"></a>Publishing events of the 1870s</h2>Although the business continued as varied and as briskly as ever, three particular publishing events distinguished the 1870s for Macmillan &amp; Co.: J. R. Green's history; the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series; and the Grove dictionary of music.<br>
<br>In 1874 Green's <span class="italic">Short History of the English People</span> appeared in one volume of 847 pages, and brought an entirely new philosophy to the recording of history. Green had originally contacted Alexander Macmillan five years earlier about this project and the publisher had offered much encouragement. Originally intended as a school manual or handbook, it focused on the social, economic, and intellectual aspects of history, eschewing accounts of atrocity, war, and conquest. Green's aim was to chart the growth of a society, using a broad approach and simple style, and the book became instantly, enormously, and unexpectedly popular, going on to achieve a remarkable publishing history. The British people were fascinated and the book sold 35,000 copies in eighteen months. It was reprinted with corrections fifteen times in the next twelve years. A second edition was called for in 1887, also reprinted several times, and another version appeared in parts in 1889, with analysis by C. W. A. Tait. Meanwhile Green prepared another, expanded, version, which appeared in four volumes between 1877 and 1880. Alexander Macmillan, always generous with his authors, rewrote Green's contract after he realized how successful the book would be. Originally, the firm had offered him &pound;350 outright, with another &pound;100 after the sale of 2000 copies; later they substituted a royalty arrangement which was much more profitable for the author. In a sense his history made both a fortune and a career for Green, who had been only marginally successful; he had large profits and Macmillan chose him to edit two new series, <span class="roman">Literary Primers</span> and <span class="roman">Historical Primers</span>, which ran to seven and eleven titles respectively.<br>
<br>John Morley, then editor of the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and a rising London man of letters, approached Alexander Macmillan in 1877 with a scheme for a new series, to which he originally gave the title <span class="roman">Short Books on Great Writers</span>. Macmillan knew Morley well; he had befriended him ten years earlier, when as a young Oxford man he was making his way in the city, by publishing an early work, <span class="italic">Edmund Burke</span> (1867). Morley now had wide contacts among fellow literary men and for some time past had been lining up possible authors for the subjects he proposed. Writing to his son, Malcolm Macmillan, Alexander reported: &#145;He has got [R. H.] Hutton for Sir Walter Scott, Goldwin Smith for Wordsworth [in actuality the work was done by F. W. H. Myers], Symonds for Shelley, Pattison for Milton, Leslie Stephen for Johnson, Morrison for Gibbon&#146;. He also told Malcolm: &#145;The idea is a sort of essay&#151;biographical and critical &hellip; about twice as long as a <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> article, and in a little volume to sell at half-a-crown&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Alexander Macmillan</span>, 342).<br>
<br>The title finally settled on was <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> and it became one of the most distinguished and influential series Macmillan &amp; Co. would ever publish. To begin, scholars of the first rank were selected to do the work, which gave the books authority, and made them suitable either for the general reader or as a point of departure for specialists. It was an idea whose time had come, in an era when the standard three-volume testamentary lives underwritten by grieving families did not provide really reliable information about their subjects. In more recent years scholars have worked to produce new, &#145;definitive&#146; portraits, but for their time the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> studies were reliable, well produced, and for nearly fifty years set the standard for critical and biographical texts.<br>
<br>In 1878 five volumes began the series: <span class="italic">Gibbon</span> by James Cotter Morison; <span class="italic">Goldsmith</span> by William Black; <span class="italic">Johnson</span> by Leslie Stephen; <span class="italic">Scott</span> by Richard H. Hutton; and <span class="italic">Shelley</span> by John Addington Symonds. Nine volumes followed in 1879, among them <span class="italic">Milton</span> by Mark Pattison and <span class="italic">Thackeray</span> by Anthony Trollope. Eight further volumes appeared between 1880 and the end of 1881; seven more were published in 1882, including Edmund Gosse's <span class="italic">Gray</span>, and Alfred Ainger's <span class="italic">Lamb</span>. Nine additional volumes were to be printed, at irregular intervals up to 1892, at which time the series was complete.<br>
<br>The third significant venture of the 1870s for Macmillan &amp; Co. was George Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> published in four volumes (1877, 1880, 1883, and 1889), a major English reference work. Grove had had a varied life, beginning his career as a civil engineer, a post which took him to the West Indies. He was also a biblical scholar as well as a first-class music historian. He served as editor of <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> from 1868 to 1883, leaving when he became director of the Royal School of Music in 1883, the year in which he also received his knighthood. His dictionary was not the first attempt at musical compilation in the language, but was by far the most comprehensive and was another set of Macmillan volumes to have a distinguished publishing history. Although there are no sales records of the first edition of Grove because it was originally envisaged as a part-work (the first volume was issued in parts), there was a second edition in five volumes (1904&#150;10), edited by J. A. Fuller Maitland, which sold 7000 sets. A third edition edited by H. C. Colles appeared in 1927; Colles also supervised the 1940 fourth edition, which added a supplement to the revised five-volume set. By 1980 a sixth edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and entitled <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, ran to twenty volumes. The enduring popularity of this reference work reflected a steadily growing interest on the part of the public in musical scholarship and history which had its origins squarely in late Victorian England.<br>
<br>The interesting point which links the three foregoing projects is the tremendous impact which each had on the public and its perception of Macmillan &amp; Co. Both generalist and specialist readers as well as scholars showed their confidence by purchasing record numbers of copies; if it had not been before, Macmillan was certainly now a dominant London publishing house. The projects succeeded because of the strong faith Alexander Macmillan had in each. Two readers for the firm expressed decidedly adverse opinions about the Green history, but Alexander's faith never wavered and was in the end fully justified. There were similar reservations among some about committing so much of the company's financial resources to the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series, which proved to be long-term substantial sellers. Again, the Grove project involved a large financial risk with no indication of the possible market for such an ambitious reference work. However, it initiated a work, <span class="italic">Grove's Musical Dictionary</span>, which was visionary for its time, yet went on to be a world leader in its field throughout the twentieth century. In each case, Alexander's intuition about public response succeeded in guiding Macmillan along the course of prudent finance and innovative publishing.<h2>
<a name="SecondgenerationMacmillans"></a>Second-generation Macmillans</h2>Despite the many successes, Alexander Macmillan's life was now undergoing many changes. In 1871 his wife, Caroline, died after an extended illness, during which her husband was unfailingly attentive. On 24 October 1872, he married a family friend, (Jeanne Barbe) Emma Pignatel, with whom he had two additional children, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1874) and John Victor (1877&#150;1956). Although Alexander Macmillan certainly remained active in the business, he was beginning to plan ahead for the eventual succession of Daniel's and his own sons. Daniel's eldest, <a name="cosubject_34798"></a><span class="headword">Sir Frederick Orridge Macmillan</span>  (1851&#150;1936)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at 29 Regent Street, Cambridge, on 5 October 1851, and had been educated at Uppingham School under Edward Thring, the well-known headmaster, and had then chosen to learn the retail bookselling business under his cousin Robert Bowes, at Cambridge, where he also studied printing technologies. In 1871 he was dispatched to the New York branch, where he remained for five years. On 15 April 1874 he took an American bride, Georgiana Elizabeth Warrin (1846&#150;1943), daughter of Thomas Warrin of New Town, Long Island. The couple had no children. By 1876 he returned to London and entered the business as a partner.<br>
<br>Alexander Macmillan's eldest son, Malcolm Kingsley (1852&#150;1889), was talented in literature and the arts, but seemingly had no head for business. He attended Marlborough College briefly, then King's College School, and after a gap entered Balliol College, Oxford, where it was said he made many valuable contacts; but he was destined for a tragic end. In July 1889, while hiking with a friend on Mount Olympus, he disappeared mysteriously and was never heard of again. A full investigation was conducted, but no body was ever found. It was a terrible blow to his father, who bore up bravely, but never really recovered from the shock.<br>
<br>Maurice Crawford (1853&#150;1936), Daniel Macmillan's second son, attended Uppingham School, where he won a scholarship in 1867, and graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge, taking a first in the classical tripos, 1875. He was classics master at St Paul's School, 1875&#150;83, during which time he published the first &#145;Macmillan family&#146; book, <span class="italic">First Latin Grammar</span> (1879) which by 1886 had been reprinted three times. At the end of 1883 he entered the family firm. On 24 November 1884 he also took an American bride, Helen Artie Tarleton Hill (1856&#150;1937) (a widow), daughter of Joshua Tarleton Belles MD of Spencer, Indiana, and they had three sons. The couple toured extensively in Australia and India (1884&#150;5), when Maurice first began to sense the importance of a broader overseas base, an opportunity for expansion that would be so important to the second Macmillan generation. His lifelong special interests were scholarship, the classics, the British empire, and the Far East.<br>
<br>George Augustin (1855&#150;1936), Alexander Macmillan's second son, was educated at Eton College, as a king's scholar, 1868, and entered the firm in 1874. In July 1879 he married Margaret Helen Lucas and they had one son and one daughter. He became chairman of Stainer and Bell, music publishers, where he served for many years; he was a founder and honorary secretary of the Hellenic Society (1879&#150;1919), and honorary treasurer until 1934. He also served as the honorary secretary of the British School at Athens (1886&#150;97). Because of his wide contacts many important books came to Macmillan in archaeology, classical art, history, and literature. The firm began publishing the <span class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</span> (1880) because of his influence, but perhaps his greatest achievement was bringing in Arthur Evans's <span class="italic">The Palace of Minos at Knossos</span> (1922&#150;35), the fascinating account of his excavations on the island of Crete.<br>
<br>By the mid-1880s, after working together for more than a decade, the Macmillan cousins had developed into a smoothly efficient team. Frederick supervised general business matters, fiction, poetry, art, and American ties. Maurice presided over India, education, the classics, and foreign expansion. George was in charge of Greek literature, archaeology, and music. Mention must also be made of William Jack, who served, during the 1870s, as a partner and adviser on mathematics until he left in 1879 to accept the chair in mathematics at the University of Glasgow. The boundaries of responsibility were fluid, however, and each of the cousins might develop and supervise any title in which he became interested. They established a working relationship that was as flawless and as understanding as the original partnership between Daniel and Alexander.<br>
<br>With new and younger men now directing the company, publishing trends were certain to change. There were new titles on a wide range of fresh subjects: Pater's <span class="italic">Studies in the Renaissance</span> (1874); Lady Barker's <span class="italic">First Lessons in the Principles of Cooking</span> (1874); in the same year, R. Jardin's <span class="italic">Elements of Psychology</span>; and Rhoda and Agnes Garrett's <span class="italic">Suggestions for House Decoration</span> (1876). Practical business concerns dictated, after passage of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, that texts, readers, and primers should proliferate. The younger Macmillans were not slow to recognize this new market, in the same way their forebears had profited from the Cambridge connection.<br>
<br>Accordingly, books appeared on a wide range of topics including algebra, anatomy and physiology, arithmetic, astronomy, calculus, chemistry, and classics. G. Eugene Fasnacht prepared no fewer than seventeen texts on teaching and learning the French and German languages; and he edited ten volumes of literary classics in those languages, together with biographical notes, historical introduction, glossary, and scholarly notes for each volume. Charles Colbeck edited a series, <span class="roman">Foreign School Classics</span>, in twenty-one volumes, as well as geology and geography primers and sketches. Several other important professional textbooks were added to the list: Henry Sidgwick's <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1883); James Fitzjames Stephen's <span class="italic">A Digest of the Criminal Law: Crimes and Punishments</span> (1883&#150;87); and <span class="italic">A Text-Book of Pathological Anatomy and Pathogenesis</span> by Ernst Ziegler and Donald MacAlister (1883&#150;7).<br>
<br>New names began to appear on the list, for which the Macmillan cousins shared the responsibility. Louis Pasteur published <span class="italic">Studies in Fermentation</span> with Macmillan in 1879. Joseph Henry Shorthouse came to the firm upon the recommendation of Mrs Humphry Ward. His <span class="italic">John Inglesant</span> (1881), a historical novel set in the English civil war, had first been published privately by the author, but now became a surprise best-seller for Macmillan, with six editions by February 1883, including one in the <span class="roman">Globe</span> series in two volumes. George Saintsbury, eventually to be one of the period's best-known literary critics, first became acquainted with Macmillan as a contributor to <span class="italic">The English Poets</span> (1880), edited by T. H. Ward, and remained because of his admiration for Frederick. They published his <span class="italic">Dryden</span> (1881), reprinted in the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series, and his influential study <span class="italic">History of Elizabethan Literature</span> (1887). An American expatriate, F. Marion Crawford, although difficult to deal with in royalty matters, nevertheless between 1882 and 1909 published all but three of his forty novels with Macmillan, including <span class="italic">Zoroaster</span> (1885), <span class="italic">A Tale of a Lonely Parish</span> (1886), <span class="italic">Sant' Ilario</span> (1889), and <span class="italic">Don Orsino</span> (1892).<br>
<br>From earliest days Alexander Macmillan and Alfred Tennyson had known and respected each other. Macmillan and David Masson visited the poet and his wife for three days in October 1859, at their home on the Isle of Wight. Despite their friendship the poet had been elusive about joining the Macmillan family of authors. Instead, he rotated among such houses as H. S. King, Alexander Strahan, and Kegan Paul, on short, five-year contracts. Finally, in 1884, as both men were nearing the end of their careers, Tennyson came to Macmillan but at the cost of a hard bargain. He insisted on a guarantee of &pound;4000 plus any additional royalties earned beyond that, but the two old friends were together at last.<br>
<br>Macmillan's <span class="roman">Colonial Library</span> was inaugurated in 1886, under the direction of Maurice Macmillan, who had long envisioned this type of expansion for the firm. It was a natural augmentation of his father's 1875 scheme of a <span class="roman">Text-Books for Indian Schools</span> series. The idea was developed as an attempt to satisfy the reading needs of India and the other colonies, and also to make use of the copyrights of standard works and popular fiction which Macmillan already owned or others which they could acquire cheaply. Several methods of supply were employed: some books from the regular list were shipped out; some were specifically planned for India but manufactured in London; others were actually published abroad. To accomplish this branches of Macmillan were established in Bombay in 1901, in Calcutta in 1907, and in Madras in 1912; there were agencies in Bangalore, Colombo, and Rangoon. Macmillan was not the first British company to publish in India; it was preceded by John Murray, Bentley, and Routledge, but these other firms' lists were composed chiefly of history, travel, biography, and memoirs, whereas 94 per cent of Macmillan's selections were fiction. The families of Indian middle classes had, since the <span class="roman">India Act</span> of 1835, been exposed to English in their schools and they had now come to enjoy literature for itself, primarily fiction. Macmillan also published in its <span class="roman">Colonial Library</span> some of Fasnacht's teaching texts for French and German, some Greek and Latin readers, and a few textbooks for Indian schools, but it was their fiction that carried the day. Between 1886 and 1916, 640 titles were published, a high percentage being novels, including works by Crawford, Mrs Oliphant, Yonge, Thomas Hardy, Lady Barker, and Hugh Conway. Ironically, a colonial author was added to the <span class="roman">Colonial Library</span> when Macmillan published an Australian classic previously published by Remington &amp; Co., <span class="italic">Robbery under Arms</span> (1889) by Alexander Browne, a police magistrate of New South Wales who used the pseudonym Rolf Boldrewood. Two of his three-deckers followed: <span class="italic">Miner's Right</span> and <span class="italic">The Colonial Reformer</span> (both 1890). Australia was another profitable market for the <span class="roman">Colonial Library</span> and, indeed, in both countries British expatriates, as well as the native population, were eager purchasers.<br>
<br>Although Thomas Hardy's early novels had been rejected by Macmillan, he first established contact there when <span class="italic">The Woodlanders</span> was accepted by <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> in 1886; it was published in book form in three volumes in 1887 and followed by <span class="italic">Wessex Tales</span> (1888). In 1886 Maurice Macmillan secured <span class="italic">The Mayor of Casterbridge</span> for the <span class="roman">Colonial Library</span>, while in 1893 Macmillan successfully acquired a dozen Hardy novels, but for the <span class="roman">Colonial Library</span> only, including <span class="italic">Tess of the d'Urbervilles</span>, which had first been published by Osgood McIlvaine in 1891. Hardy transferred all his books to Macmillan in 1902, which also published <span class="italic">The Dynasts</span> in three parts (1904&#150;8). Hardy continued to send work to the firm for the next twenty years.<br>
<br>James G. Frazer, a rising young Cambridge scholar and fellow of Trinity College, wrote to George Macmillan in 1889, proposing a book based on his work over the last five years, to be entitled <span class="italic">The Golden Bough</span>, where he would offer a comparative study of the beliefs and institutions of mankind, in order to study the progress of thought from the magical, to the religious, to the scientific. The book would look at customs such as fertility rites, the sacrificial killing of kings, the dying god, and the scapegoat, in an attempt to analyse the primitive mind. George, and his reader John Morley, realized immediately that this would be a unique contribution to social anthropology and they accepted the idea at once, not realizing they were initiating an enterprise that would last more than forty years. Publication proceeded slowly, the first two volumes appearing in May 1890; the second edition in three volumes in 1900. The third edition (still in print) began publication in 1906, and was completed in twelve volumes in 1915. <span class="italic">Aftermath: a Supplement</span> followed in 1936, making the thirteen-volume set, which is the definitive edition. Each edition was an enlargement of its predecessor. A one-volume abridged edition appeared in 1922 of which 30,000 were in print by 1933, and it thus influenced a much larger reading public. A huge correspondence remains in the Macmillan archives, including letters to and from Frazer's wife, Lilly, who edited several French schoolbooks for Macmillan. While Frazer's methods and many of his conclusions have been rendered unacceptable by more modern research, nevertheless his book stirred public imagination and he was widely considered as one of the founders of modern anthropology. Macmillan published Frazer's other works as well, including his translations, with commentaries, of <span class="italic">Pausanias</span> (1898) and the <span class="italic">Fasti</span> (1929). Because of his success with <span class="italic">The Golden Bough</span> many other books on anthropology, myth, and comparative religion were offered to George, including Edvard Westermarck's <span class="italic">History of Human Marriage</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Marriage Ceremonies in Morocco</span> (1914); Arthur Evans's <span class="italic">The Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult</span> (1901); and W. W. Skeat's and C. O. Blagden's <span class="italic">Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula</span> (1906).<br>
<br>Towards the end of the 1880s Alexander Macmillan was less and less involved with the company. He was in his seventies, after a life of hard work, and was devastated by the death of his eldest son, Malcolm, but work continued with the second generation of the family. Alexander Macmillan died on 26 January 1896 at his home, 21 Portland Place, London, and was buried in the Bramshott churchyard, Haslemere. After his death Macmillan &amp; Co. became a limited company, with Frederick Orridge Macmillan as its first chairman.<br>
<br>During the pre-war years, literary observers sometimes suggested that Macmillan &amp; Co., and particularly its readers, failed to stay abreast of the new trends in fiction during the years 1890 to 1914. Critics were puzzled to note that the company rejected H. G. Wells's <span class="italic">Ann Veronica</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">The New Machiavelli</span> (1910); the same was true for books by George Bernard Shaw, Arnold Bennett, and Somerset Maugham. In his brash way, Wells spoke out: &#145;I don't think you advertise well and I think you are out of touch with the contemporary movement in literature &hellip; On the other hand, you are solid and sound and sane&#146;  (Morgan, 147). The firm did, however, publish his <span class="italic">Twelve Stories and a Dream</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Food of the Gods and how it Came to Earth</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Kipps</span> (1905), <span class="italic">In the Days of the Comet</span> (1906), <span class="italic">Tono-Bungay</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Marriage</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> (1913), <span class="italic">The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman</span> (1914), <span class="italic">The World Set Free</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">The Research Magnificent</span> (1915). Macmillan also published Maurice Hewlett's <span class="italic">The Forest Lovers</span>, a romantic novel set in the middle ages and a best-seller of 1898. The firm's American novelists included Winston Churchill, Gertrude Atherton, and Owen Wister (<span class="italic">The Virginian</span>, 1902). As with so many others, Rudyard Kipling first came to the publisher through <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, where eight of his stories appeared between December 1889 and January 1893  (see <span class="italic">Wellesley index</span>, 1.633&#150;42), beginning with &#145;The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney&#146;. His enormous early popularity with the reading public resulted in a large number of collected editions of his work, under such labels as Uniform, Pocket, Deluxe, and School.<br>
<br>Early in 1890 Frederick Macmillan stepped forward to offer leadership in a bitter controversy dividing the publishing and bookselling world. The trouble had been brewing for years because booksellers ignored the price fixed on a book by a publisher, in favour of their own discounted one, thus instigating cut-throat competition. Frederick Macmillan suggested what became known as the net book agreement, whereby there would be two classes of books, with different kinds of prices: the &#145;net&#146; price fixed by the publisher and adhered to by all, for which, if accepted by a bookseller, the bookseller would receive a set discount, and the &#145;subject&#146;, where booksellers would be free to set their own selling price. Frederick began his campaign for reform with a letter to <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> (6 March 1890), outlining his plan, and provoking spirited discussion in the trade. As a test case, he selected, in July 1890, an important book, <span class="italic">Principles of Economics</span> by Alfred Marshall, and &#145;fixed&#146; the price, declaring, &#145;If a book is good enough, a bookseller cannot afford to be without it&#146;  (Morgan, 179). The dispute was so heated and so sensitive, however, that no compromise seemed possible until January 1899, when the Publishers' Association was finally able to send to the Associated Booksellers a proposal that proved acceptable.<br>
<br>Frederick Macmillan again stepped forward as a leader in 1905 when <span class="italic">The Times</span> introduced a scheme seemingly designed to subvert the net book agreement. It offered membership in a new Times Book Club to its annual subscribers, the club to serve as a lending library for current books. Soon officials of the club were found to be selling as &#145;used&#146; books volumes that had been circulated only once or twice, and setting their own prices. The result was a bitter struggle between publishers and <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which would only be resolved after ownership of the newspaper changed hands. The new owner, Lord Northcliffe, paid Frederick Macmillan a secret visit to enlist his help in settling the dispute. Even with the best efforts of both men to avert a book war, it was not until the end of the year that <span class="italic">The Times</span> retreated. Macmillan served as president of the Publishers' Association from 1900 to 1902, and again from 1911 to 1913. He received a knighthood in 1909, not for his services to publishing, but for his work as chairman, from 1903, of the board of management of the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square, London.<br>
<br>The years 1897 and 1898 were marked by two important events for Macmillan. The first was construction of a new building for the firm's headquarters in St Martin's Street between Leicester Square and the National Gallery. Designed and equipped specially for publishing needs, it served for many years as Macmillan's principal place of business. The second event, purchase of all the stock and possessions of Richard Bentley &amp; Son, of 8 New Burlington Street, had a far-reaching impact on Macmillan's family of authors. The firm had originally been founded by Charles Colburn about 1806, and underwent various changes in ownership until it became Richard Bentley in 1832, and ultimately Richard Bentley &amp; Son from 1871 to 1898. For the sum of &pound;8000 Macmillan acquired a quantity of unwanted stock, the steel and copperplates of the illustrators George Cruikshank, John Tenniel, and George Du Maurier, plus a number of fine old portraits, all of which were sold to finance the purchase. What Macmillan kept resulted in a dramatic addition to their list. The firm gained R. H. Barham's <span class="italic">Ingoldsby Legends</span> (1840&#150;46) and <span class="italic">Life and Remains of Thomas Hook</span> (1849); Theodore Mommsen's <span class="italic">History of Rome</span> (1862&#150;75); Frederick Courtney Selous's <span class="italic">Hunter's Wanderings in Africa</span> (1881); Edward Fitzgerald's <span class="italic">Letters to Fanny Kemble</span> (1895); and Harold Fielding-Hall's <span class="italic">The Soul of a People</span> (1898). A number of female novelists were added: Mrs W. K. Clifford, Mrs Annie Edwards, Rhoda Broughton, Helen Mathers, Mary Cholmondeley, Jessie Fothergill, Florence Montgomery, Rosa N. Carey, and Mrs Henry Wood. Male novelists acquired were Anthony Trollope, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, and Marcus Clarke. Two periodicals were also included: <span class="italic">The Argosy</span> and <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>.<h2>
<a name="Theearlytomidtwentiethcenturythethirdgeneration"></a>The early to mid-twentieth century: the third generation</h2>The early years of the twentieth century brought a mixed group of publishing events to Macmillan. John Morley's long-awaited <span class="italic">Life of Gladstone</span> (1903) was a critical success, and sold 25,041 copies in the first year, but was only a token success financially; the Gladstone family had published on commission and reaped the profit. Some early Irish writers appeared. Sidney Royse Lysaght brought <span class="italic">Poems of the Unknown Way</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Horizons and Landmarks</span> (1911); and Stephen Gwynn, <span class="italic">Old Knowledge</span> (1901), <span class="italic">John Maxwell's Marriage</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Masters of English Literature</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">Robert Emmet</span> (1909). A new <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series was also begun at this time, under the editorship of J. C. Squire. It ran to twenty-five titles between 1902 and 1919, including: <span class="italic">George Eliot</span> (1902) by Leslie Stephen, <span class="italic">Robert Browning</span> (1903) by G. K. Chesterton, and <span class="italic">Jane Austen</span> (1919) by F. Warre-Cornish. The eminent Bengali poet, critic, and short fiction writer Rabindranath Tagore also joined Macmillan with his free-verse re-creations of his Bengali poems modelled on a medieval Indian devotional lyric, <span class="italic">Gitanjali: Song Offerings</span> (1913), which won the Nobel prize for literature, the first for an Asian writer.<br>
<br>Two third-generation Macmillans joined the board in 1911: William Edward Frank (1880&#150;1954), known as Will, George's son, and <a name="cosubject_72792"></a><span class="headword">Daniel de Mendi Macmillan</span>  (1886&#150;1965)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of Maurice Crawford Macmillan and his wife, Helen Artie (Nellie) Tarleton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Belles. Daniel de Mendi Macmillan was born on 1 February 1886 at Middleton House, Wandle Road, Wandsworth, London. He was educated at Eton College (where he was Newcastle scholar) and Balliol College, Oxford (1904&#150;8). He joined the army in 1914, and was invalided the following year; towards the end of the war, on 5 April 1918, he married Margaret (1889/90&#150;1957), the daughter of Louis Matthews (they were to have no children). He returned to publishing soon after, and acted as chairman of the company from 1936 to 1965. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40185/', "(Maurice) Harold Macmillan, later earl of Stockton (1894&#150;1986)")</script>, entered the firm in 1920 as a director, and continued except for times when serving as a government minister; he was deputy chairman from 1936 to 1940, and from 1945 to 1951. He served as the British prime minister from 1957 to 1963, but after his term of office was concluded he succeeded his brother as chairman. William, a musician and director of Stainer and Bell, was a good classical scholar and a historian; Daniel, also a classical scholar, continued development of the Indian branch and the educational lists and supervised the continuity of the firm's publications. Mention must also be made of Thomas Mark Macmillan, who joined the firm in 1913 as secretary to the board and became a director in 1944.<br>
<br>Despite the obvious difficulties and hardships posed in the years of the First World War, the Macmillan partners struggled to prevent any major disruption of the firm's publishing schedule. Many books dealt directly with the wartime situation. Some of these were Owen Wister's <span class="italic">The Pentecost of Calamity</span> (1915), F. S. Oliver's <span class="italic">Ordeal by Battle</span> (1915), Mabel Dearmer's <span class="italic">Letters from a Field Hospital</span> (1915), Winston Churchill's <span class="italic">The Fighting Line</span> (1916), and Edith Wharton's <span class="italic">The Marne</span> (1918); and three volumes from Kipling, <span class="italic">France at War</span>, <span class="italic">The New Army in Training</span>, and <span class="italic">Fringes of the Fleet</span>, all in 1915. Others emphasized the &#145;business as usual&#146; philosophy, in order to divert people's minds, with titles such as Henry Clay's <span class="italic">Economics: an Introduction for the General Reader</span> (1916), Morley's <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1917), Edmund Gosse's <span class="italic">Life of Charles Algernon Swinburne</span> (1917), and Saintsbury's <span class="italic">History of the French Novel</span> (1917&#150;19). The cousins also recognized that spiritual topics were important in wartime, hence William Temple's <span class="italic">Studies in the Spirit and Truth of Christianity</span> (1914), J. R. Illingsworth's <span class="italic">The Gospel Miracles</span> (1915), H. B. Swete's <span class="italic">The Holy Catholic Church</span> (1915), and Hensley Henson's <span class="italic">Christian Liberty</span> (1918). Important works of scholarship also found a place: P. M. Sykes's <span class="italic">History of Persia</span> (1915), Thomas Watts Eden's and C. H. J. Lockyer's <span class="italic">New System of Gynaecology</span>, and Frazer's <span class="italic">Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</span> (1918). Some room was found, even in wartime, for literary works: there were two collections of Hardy's poetry, <span class="italic">Satires of Circumstance</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">Moments of Vision and Miscellaneous Verse</span> (1917); and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1914).<br>
<br>An infusion of new blood from William and Daniel de Mendi Macmillan brought change to the manuscript selection process. The venerable John Morley was replaced as senior reader in favour of Charles Whibley, a younger man of more modern tastes and outlook. An immediate consequence of this move was a marked increase in the recognition of Irish writers. James Stephens, an engaging writer of Irish fantasy, published his first novel, <span class="italic">The Charwoman's Daughter</span> (1912), with the firm, and remained with it for four more: <span class="italic">The Crock of Gold</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Demi-Gods</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Songs from the Clay</span> (1915), and <span class="italic">The Adventures of Seumas Beg</span> (1915). A. E. (George William Russell), a leader in the Irish literary renaissance, came at roughly the same time, and Macmillan published his collected verse over the next twenty years: <span class="italic">Gods of War</span> (1915), <span class="italic">Candle of Vision</span> (1918), <span class="italic">Voices of the Stones</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Vale and other Poems</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The House of Titans and other Poems</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1935). In a reader's report for 1900 John Morley had said of William Butler Yeats: &#145;The work does not please the ear, nor kindle the imagination&#146;  (Morgan, 221). By 1916 Macmillan thinking was so changed that the firm published his <span class="italic">Responsibilities</span> and <span class="italic">Reveries over Childhood</span>: in the same year company executives acquired, through failure of Yeats's publisher, A. H. Bullen, thirteen volumes published earlier, and Yeats remained a Macmillan author until his death in 1939. Yeats supervised revision of two volumes published posthumously, and delayed by the Second World War: <span class="italic">The Poems of W. B. Yeats</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">The Collected Plays of W. B. Yeats</span>, a revision and expansion of the collection of 1934.<br>
<br>By securing Yeats the third-generation Macmillans opened the floodgates of Irish literature over the next twenty-five years. Padraic Colum published <span class="italic">The King of Ireland's Son</span> (1916) and during the next ten years fifteen more titles. Sean O'Casey brought two plays in 1925, <span class="italic">Juno and the Paycock</span> and <span class="italic">The Shadow of a Gunman</span>, and henceforth Macmillan published all his plays. In addition, they published a collection of his articles on theatre, <span class="italic">The Flying Wasp</span> (1937), six volumes of his autobiography between 1939 and 1963, and two editions of his collected plays (1939 and 1951). A veritable parade of Irish literati now published with Macmillan: Alice Stopford Green (<span class="italic">History of the Irish State to 1914</span>, 1925); Eimar O'Duffy (his satire <span class="italic">King Goshawk and the Birds</span>, 1926); F. R. Higgins (<span class="italic">The Dark Bread</span>, 1927, and <span class="italic">Gap of Brightness</span>, 1940). Esme Stuart Lennox Robinson, for nearly fifty years a playwright, manager, and director connected with Dublin's Abbey Theatre, published his collected plays in 1928. <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1930) by Katharine Tynan and George Shiels's <span class="italic">Two Irish Plays</span> (1930), remained on the list for the next fifteen years; Frank O'Connor (Michael O'Donovan) published many collections of his short stories, including <span class="italic">Guests of the Nation</span> (1931); John Eglinton (pseudonym for William Kirkpatrick Magee) offered <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">Memoir of A. E.</span> (1937); Paul Vincent Carroll published his important play <span class="italic">Shadow and Substance</span> (1938), and Joseph Hone's biography <span class="italic">W. B. Yeats</span> was issued in 1942.<br>
<br>At the close of the First World War, with third-generation Macmillans William and Daniel de Mendi firmly in control of the company and cousin Harold about to join it (1920), they set about consolidating their list over the next twenty years. A series of collected editions was planned: the thirty-seven volume <span class="roman">Mellstock</span> edition of Thomas Hardy's works (1919&#150;20); John Morley's collected work in fifteen volumes (1921); W. E. Henley in five (1921); and Henry James in thirty-five volumes (1922&#150;33). (James had first come to Macmillan with a volume of essays, <span class="italic">French Poets and Novelists</span>, published in 1877. Although not a profitable author for the firm, it nevertheless published most of his subsequent books as well as the New York edition of his novels.) Aside from the Hardy set, these were not financially successful. Apparently the public, while strong book buyers, wanted eclectic choice rather than collections.<br>
<br>Macmillan titles in history and science proved more popular. John Fortescue, the military historian, published his monumental thirteen-volume <span class="italic">History of the British Army</span> (1899&#150;1930), as well as <span class="italic">The Correspondence of George III</span> (1927) which sold well, as did <span class="italic">The Greville Memoirs</span> (1938), edited by Lytton Strachey and Roger Fulford. Lewis Namier, the distinguished historian, brought to the company <span class="italic">The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III</span> (1929) and <span class="italic">England in the Age of the American Revolution</span> (1930). J. L. Garvin's <span class="italic">The Life of Joseph Chamberlain</span> appeared in 1932, and Emily Anderson edited <span class="italic">The Letters of Mozart and his Family</span> (1938).<br>
<br>During the 1920s and 1930s the younger Macmillans saw the need to revise and update the firm's very successful teaching tools, something which had become a strong part of the business. The <span class="roman">Modern French</span> and the <span class="roman">Modern German</span> texts appeared, along with the <span class="roman">Modern Classic</span> series as an addition to the <span class="roman">Elementary Classics</span>. E. J. S. Lay produced <span class="italic">Teaching in Practice for Infant Schools: Projects and Pictures</span> (1934&#150;7), which addressed contemporary concerns about the methodology of teaching. It was a predominant text in its field for the next thirty years, providing a complete teaching programme for infant schools as well as suggestions for primary and secondary syllabuses.<br>
<br>Early in the period following the First World War the young Macmillans had begun to develop an especially strong list of economic and political titles. John Maynard Keynes, the noted economist, and Daniel de Mendi began at Eton what was to be a lifelong friendship, so it was natural that the firm should publish his <span class="italic">Economic Consequences of Peace</span> (1919), written in strong opposition to the provisions of the Versailles peace conference, which he attended as a representative of the government, accompanied by Daniel. <span class="italic">A Treatise of Probability</span> (1921) followed soon after, and later his two great works <span class="italic">A Treatise on Money</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</span> (1936); in 1940 he published <span class="italic">How to Pay for the War</span>. Keynes served as Daniel's adviser on other economic works, including Alfred Marshall's <span class="italic">Industry and Trade</span> (1919), Arthur C. Pigou's <span class="italic">Economics of Welfare</span> (1920), and E. H. Carr's <span class="italic">International Relations since the Peace Treaties</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919&#150;1939</span> (1939). He also edited the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> for Macmillan from 1912 to 1945. Because of Keynes's reputation many other economists came to the firm, including G. D. H. Cole, George Peel, Norman Crump, Paul Einzig, Colin Clark, Sir Cecil Kisch, Lord Stamp, Lionel Robbins, and Joan Robinson.<br>
<br>Fiction was one highly successful venture for Macmillan in the twenty years between the world wars. Hugh Walpole first came to the firm in 1918 and by the thirties had developed the <span class="italic">Herries Chronicle</span>, a four-novel sequence set in Cumberland: <span class="italic">Rogue Herries</span> (1930); <span class="italic">Judith Paris</span> (1931); <span class="italic">The Fortress</span> (1932); and <span class="italic">Vanessa</span> (1933). This was a strong commercial success, with <span class="italic">Judith Paris</span> selling 20,000 copies in the first two weeks. Another popular novelist of the era was Mazo de la Roche, whose publications <span class="italic">Jalna</span> (1927), transferred from Little, Brown, and <span class="italic">Whiteoaks</span> (1929) combined to produce the <span class="roman">Jalna/Whiteoaks</span> series of sixteen novels, similar in popularity to the <span class="italic">Herries</span> volumes. In the late 1920s and early 1930s Macmillan also acquired novels from E. M. Delafield, Richard Crompton, Edward Shanks, John Collier, Edward Thompson, A. G. Macdonell, Charles Morgan, and Naomi Royde Smith. Vera Brittain came to the firm with <span class="italic">Testament of Friendship</span> (1940).<br>
<br>It remained, however, for one British man and one American woman to provide Macmillan with two runaway best-sellers in the space of a little over a decade. James Hilton's <span class="italic">Lost Horizon</span> (1933), an evocative novel set in Shangri-La, a Tibetan lamasery where inhabitants never grow old, was a great success in both Britain and America, winning the Hawthornden prize in 1934. Hilton subsequently became a fiction reader for the firm. In 1936 Margaret Mitchell surprised everyone with her blockbuster <span class="italic">Gone with the Wind</span>. The Macmillan partners misjudged its appeal to the public, initially printing only 3000 copies; soon they needed 30,000, and ultimately they printed in runs of 100,000. Clearly, the investment made by the third-generation Macmillan cousins in fiction was a shrewd move.<br>
<br>In 1936 the Macmillan family and the Macmillan business suffered sad losses in the deaths of the three senior partners, George on 3 March, Maurice on 30 March, and Frederick on 1 June 1936. As in the past, the transfer of power had already been made and the family members were in place to ensure no outward confusion or interruption to the routine of business. Will retired, and Daniel de Mendi and Harold now assumed the major leadership roles, with Daniel as chairman and Harold as his deputy.<br>
<br>The Sitwell family became Macmillan authors with Osbert's <span class="italic">Penny Foolish</span> (1935), a volume of essays, and a volume of lectures by all three, Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell, <span class="italic">Trio</span> (1938). Such well-known poets as Sturge Moore, Edward Shanks, and Edmund Blunden came to Macmillan in the 1930s and early 1940s, after having first published elsewhere. For Lawrence Binyon the firm published several volumes of poetry and then his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1931).<br>
<br>With the advent of the Second World War the Macmillan family faced a crucial decision: should they move the firm's stock and offices out of London to avoid damage from bombing, or should they sit tight and tough it out? Harold Macmillan was credited with making the decision to stay put, based on the security and deep basement of the company's building. Careful preparations were made for gas masks, drills were conducted, and the structure was fitted out in case of a long siege. It withstood whatever assault the Germans mounted and at the war's end had the proud record that no one had been injured at Macmillan, and business had been conducted as usual.<h2>
<a name="1945tothepresent"></a>1945 to the present</h2>At the conclusion of the war Macmillan, in common with other British publishers, faced a severe paper shortage; the question was whether to expend its short supplies on new works, or to attempt to restore the existing list to normality. The Macmillan family decided on the latter course, in keeping with their long-standing policy of treating authors fairly. Texts, for both school and university, had top priority. Classics in their field, such as <span class="italic">The Golden Bough</span>, were continued. Living authors, and the estates of deceased writers which relied on royalties for income, also had priority. Even the opportunity to publish such a potentially important and profitable work as Winston Churchill's war memoirs was sacrificed in light of this policy.<br>
<br>As publishing conditions improved, four new series were inaugurated: the <span class="roman">Casebook</span> series, providing critical commentary on general authors for undergraduates; the <span class="roman">Companion</span> series, providing critical commentary for the general reader; and the <span class="roman">Master</span> series, supplying textbooks directly to students. By far the biggest seller, however, was the <span class="roman">Macmillan Crime Fiction</span> series, which published forty to fifty titles each year.<br>
<br>In the decades following 1945 many important novelists, poets, critics, historians, and other scholars were added to the Macmillan list. The philosopher A. J. Ayer, Leon Edel, Rumer Godden, Rupert Hart-Davis, Frank O'Connor, A. L. Rowse, C. P. Snow and his wife, Pamela Hansford Johnson, Muriel Spark, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and J. W. Wheeler-Bennett were but a few of these new Macmillan authors. The year 1951 saw the sale of the New York branch of the firm, while St Martin's Press became the focus of Macmillan interests in the United States.<br>
<br>Always strong in reference works, the modern Macmillan list included such major works as <span class="italic">The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1980); <span class="italic">The New Palgrave: a Dictionary of Economics</span> (1987); and <span class="italic">The Dictionary of Art</span> (1996). <span class="italic">The Macmillan Encyclopedia</span> (annually since 1980) was praised by Harold Macmillan for containing &#145;ideas which we need to understand in order to appreciate the intellectual currents of our time&#146;. Other reference works included <span class="italic">The Macmillan Nautical Almanac</span> (annually since 1980); <span class="italic">British Archives</span> (1982), a useful location list of British manuscript archives; the <span class="roman">Macmillan Literary Companions</span> (from 1968); and <span class="italic">The Macmillan Dictionary of Women's Biography</span> (1989), a pioneering work in its field.<br>
<br>In the years following the retirement of Harold Macmillan from the premiership in 1963, his energies were redirected towards publishing. He took over as chairman from his brother Daniel in 1963, and the company embarked on a period of rapid expansion, with the opening of overseas offices, mainly in African and Asian countries, and the development of educational publishing on a much more ambitious scale than ever before. Daniel de Mendi Macmillan died of heart failure at his home, 3 Grosvenor Square, Westminster, London, on 6 December 1965.<br>
<br>The Macmillan family's active participation in the company continued. Maurice Victor Macmillan (1921&#150;1984), Harold's only son, an MP for many years and a minister in the Douglas-Home government, divided his time between publishing and politics, and was one of the founding fathers of Pan Books, the pioneer of quality paperback publishing in the post-war era. His eldest son, Alexander (<i>b</i>. 1943), abandoned a successful career in journalism to join the company. In 1986, upon the death of Harold Macmillan, by this time the first earl of Stockton, management of the publishing interests had largely passed to non-family directors. Following the disposal by the family trusts of the majority of the shares to Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck in 1995, Alexander Macmillan, now the second earl, had embraced a challenging career as a member of the European parliament.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>As one looks back over the one and a half centuries of the Macmillan family as publishers, one sees that each incarnation of the family brought its own individual qualities to ensure the firm's growth and success. Daniel Macmillan, although cut off in his prime, had the dream and the vision to foresee success in a publishing venture. He brought the traditionally Scottish traits of honesty, hard work, and fair dealing with authors. He was also shrewd in developing the Cambridge connection in the early days of the business.<br>
<br>When the responsibility fell on Alexander Macmillan, he saw the need for steady growth and innovation. His contributions were enormous, when one considers that he moved the business to London, conceived the idea of publishing in series, and then inaugurated one important idea after another: the <span class="roman">Golden Treasury</span>; the <span class="roman">Globe</span>; the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span>. He founded a magazine, <span class="italic">Macmillan's</span>, that prospered for almost fifty years, and another, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, which is still a respected publication today; he founded the American branch; he published significant scholarly journals; he launched a musical dictionary that remains a valued source in its revised edition. Perhaps most remarkable, with only the education a village school, plus wide reading, could provide, he moved on terms of equality and respect among the foremost men of his time; and he had an uncanny ability to sense what would prove popular with the general public.<br>
<br>The second generation, in particular through the work of Sir Frederick Orridge Macmillan, provided continued growth and established Macmillan unquestionably as one of the world's leading publishing houses. But possibly, for long-term impact, the most important accomplishment was the establishment of the Macmillan presence overseas. That would result in the 1990s in the firm having offices, not only in the United States and Canada, but also in most of the world's capitals.<br>
<br>The third generation moved the company from the Victorian era to the modern age. New, contemporary authors were added to the list, reflecting changes in the literary climate. Books on the science of economics became a major commitment. This generation had to survive the two world wars, while doing business as nearly normally as possible. Clearly, each generation of the Macmillan family has made its own significant contribution to the leadership, prosperity, and success of the company.<br>
