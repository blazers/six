</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walton,  Brian</span>  (1600&#150;1661), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester and biblicist</span>, was born in the district of Cleveland in the North Riding of Yorkshire, either at Hilton or the adjoining parish of Seamer or Seymour; he had at least one brother, William, who survived him. He matriculated sizar from Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1616. Two years later, on 4 December 1618, aged eighteen, he migrated to Peterhouse, from where he graduated BA in 1620 and proceeded MA in 1623.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Following his ordination that year Walton exercised a clerical and teaching ministry in Suffolk. Here he met his first wife, Anne Claxton (<i>d</i>. 1640), whose family name occurs at Chedeston and Livermere. Shortly after his marriage he went to London, where some time before 1 April 1625 he became assistant to Richard Stock, the puritan rector of All Hallows, Bread Street. It is not clear what Walton's position was in the months following Stock's death in April 1626. On 1 October 1628 he was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's to the rectory of St Martin Orgar, Cannon Street.<br>
<br>Walton was an active and controversial clerical figure during the 1630s, clashing with civic leaders as well as with his own parishioners, among whom puritanism was strong. He organized much of the campaign by London clergy to address the perceived problem of significant underpayment of tithes by many citizens, who could not then be prosecuted in the ecclesiastical courts. Following the failure of earlier efforts to achieve legislative redress, in 1634 Walton and others presented a petition on the subject to Charles I. By December referral to a committee for arbitration had failed to resolve the issue and the king took it up himself. Walton delivered to him a lengthy work on the history of tithes and a valuation of all the livings in the capital that he had laboriously compiled, eventually published first as <span class="italic">An Abstract of a Treatise</span> [1641] and then in full as <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning the Payment of Tythes and Obligations in London</span> in Samuel Brewster's <span class="italic">Collectanea ecclesiastica</span> (1752). Surviving manuscripts in Lambeth Palace Library written by, or annotated by, Walton demonstrate the lengths to which he went to compose this work. Since some of the documents he consulted were destroyed in the great fire of London it remains a valuable source for clerical perspectives and parish finances before the civil war, but immediate impact was limited. After an ineffectual order that meetings of arrangement should be held in each parish, towards the end of 1638 Charles gave leave to the clergy to sue individually in the ecclesiastical courts.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Walton, having gained notice, was presented by the king on 15 January 1636 to the two livings of St Giles-in-the-Fields and Sandon, Essex, the former of which he swiftly resigned. He is said to have served as a royal chaplain, although there is no independent evidence for this. In 1639 he proceeded DD. On 25 May 1640 his wife died and was buried at Sandon.<h2>
<a name="Conflictandsequestration"></a>Conflict and sequestration</h2>Walton's enthusiastic support for the policies of Archbishop William Laud and staunch opposition to puritanism had led in the 1630s to a protracted feud with a number of his puritan parishioners at St Martin Orgar, played out in the court of high commission. In 1641 a section of his parishioners took advantage of favourable political conditions to present a petition to parliament seeking the deprivation of their minister. In the same year they published it as <span class="italic">The articles and charges prov'd in parliament against Dr Walton, minister of St Martin's Orgars in Cannon Street</span>. Walton was accused of being disruptive, appropriating to his own use church income intended for other purposes, maliciously seeking to excommunicate parishioners, and refusing to preach on Sunday afternoons or allow members of the parish to hire a preacher. In response he claimed that a malicious minority had instigated the petition, and most of these had been persuaded or pressured into signing up to the charges. He depicted his opponents as unrepresentative of the general opinion in the parish, of lowly position, and pursuing a hidden agenda, but whatever the motives of the parishioners many were of considerable standing and wealth: five had served on the vestry during the 1630s and two were among the wealthiest in the parish.<br>
<br>In January 1642 the House of Commons referred the petition to committee and the following December Walton was summoned as a delinquent. By 20 June 1643 he had been sequestrated from his benefices. At some point he went to the royalist headquarters at Oxford, where he was appointed to wait on the duke of York and where, in 1645, he was incorporated DD. Following the surrender of the city in June 1646, on 17 October he petitioned to compound on the Oxford articles for the &#145;remainder of his estate, his library and other goods to the value of &pound;1,000 having been sold&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). This was granted on 7 January 1647, and he was fined a tenth of his estate, some &pound;35 10<i>s</i>., but by July he was in trouble for encouraging his former parishioners at Sandon not to pay tithes to the minister who had replaced him. On 27 September the committee for plundered ministers ordered that he be sent for in custody; according to John Walker he suffered at the hands of the soldiers at Sandon. Subsequently he moved to London, where he lodged with the ejected rector of St Giles Cripplegate, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10239/', "William Fuller (1579/80&#150;1659)")</script>, who had also been in the royalist garrison at Oxford. Some time before 28 October 1657, when his son Bryan was baptized, Walton married Fuller's daughter Jane.<h2>
<a name="TheLondonpolyglotBible"></a>The London polyglot Bible</h2>In Oxford oriental studies had been flourishing at least since the time of Laud's ascendancy. Here Walton had taken the opportunity of enforced leisure to acquire some knowledge of the ancient biblical languages, and had developed the project of producing a polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Three such Bibles had been produced at Alcal&aacute;, Antwerp, and Paris between 1500 and 1650, all massive works compiled over some time by consortia of scholars at considerable expense. Walton acknowledged that the prohibitive cost of the Paris version, published a few years earlier, had resulted in very poor sales, but argued that the advanced state of oriental learning in England rendered an improved edition possible within the terms of his scheme.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1652 the council of state passed a resolution to inform Walton that they found the project worthy, but thought it more suitable for the consideration of parliament. He possessed no influence with the regime and it is possible that John Milton was responsible for the positive reception of a work already being spoken of with great expectation. The council lent Walton books which had come into its possession to facilitate his work, but neither it nor the protectorate government gave the editor any pecuniary support beyond allowing him to import paper duty free. However, on a work the size of the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, this represented a considerable financial saving. Walton thanked Oliver Cromwell in the preface of early editions, but after the Restoration a reprinted preface was substituted alluding to an endeavour on Cromwell's part to suppress the work unless it was dedicated to him and asserting, on the other hand, that the king, consulted in exile, had expressed himself willing to bear its costs were it not for his banishment.<br>
<br>Walton's project received the approbation of Archbishop James Ussher and the distinguished parliamentarian, jurist, and oriental scholar John Selden. The services of many eminent scholars at both universities were retained. Most of those who made their services available were royalists, though a few had conformed to the change of regime. Expertise, rather than political or religious allegiance, was the key criterion for involvement. <span class="italic">A Brief Description of an Edition of the Bible</span> (1653) and <span class="italic">Propositions Concerning the Printing of the Bible</span> (1653) contained a number of errors and the quality of printing was poor. Critics, including Arnold Boate, were quick to express their criticisms. Walton, however, promised that these defects would be remedied. A committee of reputable persons was formed to receive the subscriptions that were solicited in the prospectus, with the promise of a complete copy of the work for every &pound;10 subscribed. A strategic campaign to encourage subscribers was highly successful, bringing in, from abroad as well as at home, some &pound;8000 in just a few months. Colleges of both universities made sacrifices to support the work. This enabled Walton to commission the founding of new types to significantly improve the print quality of the publication.<br>
<br>The printing of the work began in 1653, two presses being kept employed, and between 1654 and 1657 all six volumes appeared. Volumes 1&#150;4 contained the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, volume 5 the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and volume 6 various critical appendices. Nine languages are represented in the work, although no single book of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> appears in more than eight versions. The correcting committee consisted of David Stokes, Abraham Wheelocke, Herbert Thorndike, Edward Pococke, Thomas Greaves, John Vicars, and Thomas Smith; on the death of Wheelocke in 1653 Thomas Hyde was substituted for him. Much of the work was done by Edmund Castell, whose <span class="italic">Heptaglot Lexicon</span> afterwards formed a valuable supplement to the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Castell had a fractious relationship with Walton and later complained that his services had been inadequately recognized. Many other scholars contributed, but Walton claimed responsibility for the whole, and provided it with prolegomena giving a critical history of the texts and some account of the languages that they represented. The prolegomena were reprinted in Germany in 1777, and England in 1828, testament to the lasting importance of Walton's scholarly expositions. Walton also published in 1655 a brief <span class="italic">Introductio in lectionem linguarum orientalium</span>, containing the alphabets and grammatical paradigms of all the languages printed in the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> as well as of some others. Intended as an advertisement, it also provided those interested in studying the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> with the necessary apparatus to develop the required linguistic skills. The work demonstrates the breadth of Walton's knowledge of ancient languages.<br>
<br>The polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> was regarded at the time of its appearance as a monument to the intellectual capacity of an English nation previously eclipsed by some of its European brethren. It was also a successful commercial speculation. Though not the first book printed by subscription in England it was one of the earliest and most ambitious. The work commanded a high price on the continent; in a letter to John Buxtorf the younger, at Basel, Walton puts the price at &pound;50. In the latter half of the seventeenth century secondhand copies in England invariably fetched in excess of &pound;10. The London polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> often constituted the single most expensive item in the libraries of scholars and gentlemen.<br>
<br>The polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> was put on the <span class="italic">Index librorum prohibitorum</span> at Rome, and in England was attacked by John Owen in <span class="italic">Of the Divine Original of Scripture</span>. He rejected a number of academic positions postulated by Walton in the prolegomena to the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but his chief fear was that the publication would provide ammunition to those who wished to undermine the status of scripture. Walton responded immediately in a work called <span class="italic">The Considerator Considered</span> (1659), which never mentioned Owen by name, but dismissed his arguments out of hand and defended the validity and necessity of responsible biblical scholarship.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>In 1657 Walton was consulted by members of the grand committee of religion appointed to consider the desirability of a revision of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In 1658 Walton contributed to a work by the Laudian propagandist Thomas Pierce, <span class="italic"><i>Heauton timoroumenos</i>, or, The Self-Revenger Exemplified</span>, which sought to claim that Archbishop James Ussher had abandoned Calvinism and embraced the Arminian creed shortly before his death. Walton testified to conversations he had held with the primate in which Ussher had espoused such beliefs. However, Ussher's former chaplain, Nicholas Bernard, and others rejected the claims, and since Ussher was ever willing to mediate between protestant factions, the likelihood that he abandoned a lifelong commitment to Calvinism is remote.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Walton was reinstated in his benefices and made chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. On 14 August 1660 he received the prebend of Wenlakesbarn in St Paul's Cathedral. Later that year he was made bishop of Chester and was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 2 December. In March 1661 he became a member of the Savoy conference. He also petitioned for and received other livings to hold <i>in commendam</i> with his bishopric. He visited his diocese in September 1661 and was well received, but after returning to London he died in his house in Aldersgate Street on 29 November. On 5 December he was buried at St Paul's, following a public funeral. In his will, dated 2 August 1658, he had declared his firm adherence to the liturgy of the Church of England, &#145;as itt was constituted before this Rebellion of the Puritanes&#146;. He was, he declared, &#145;in Communion with the Catholique Church of Christ, both for doctrine, discipline, government and publique worshipp, rejecting as schismaticks, heretiques, and sacralegious persons marked in these latter ages under the vizerr of Protestants and Reformers&#146;. Since presbyterians, Independents, and sectaries had &#145;broken the Communion of the Church, no fellowshipp in worshipp or discipline cann bee lawfully maintained with them&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/306, sig. 207). The principal portion of his estate was divided between his son Bryan and wife, Jane, the former receiving &pound;500, the latter &pound;1000. He left a copy of the great <span class="roman">Bible</span>, in imperial paper, to Bryan to pass on through the family. Twenty clergymen who &#145;have suffered in these tymes for theire loyaltie and constancy in the Truth&#146;  (ibid.) were each to receive &pound;5. In 1683 Walton's library was auctioned by the London bookseller Samuel Carr. The sale comprised 1840 lots. Latin books included bibles, patristic publications, and works on early church history. There were fifty-three manuscripts, including Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, and Syriac texts. English works included a large number of pamphlets from the civil war and Commonwealth times. <br>
<br>The London polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> represented the apogee of Renaissance biblical productions. The work was highly regarded in Europe in intellectual theological circles throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Walton's pivotal role in its production was recognized and praised by his contemporaries, while his learned prolegomena to the work drew compliments into the nineteenth century. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> regarded him as having only a tolerable knowledge of biblical and oriental languages. It would be more accurate to describe him as a considerable scholar wise enough to draw on the very considerable expertise of his contemporaries.<br>
