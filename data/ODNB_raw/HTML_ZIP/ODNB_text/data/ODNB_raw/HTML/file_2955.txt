<span class="headword">Bosworth,  Joseph</span>  (1787/8&#150;1876), <span class="occ">Old English scholar</span>, the third son of Thomas Bosworth of Etwall, Derbyshire, was born at Etwall and was baptized there on 1 June 1788. He was educated at Repton grammar school, and then at the University of Aberdeen, where at an early age he took the degree of MA, and subsequently that of LLD. He later became a member of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was ordained deacon in 1814, and priest in 1815. After serving as curate of Bunny in Nottinghamshire, he was in 1817 presented to the vicarage of Little Horwood, in Buckinghamshire, a preferment that he held for twelve years.<br>
<br>In 1821 Bosworth published two educational works entitled <span class="italic">Latin Construing, or, Lessons from Classical Authors</span> and <span class="italic">An Introduction to Latin Construing</span>, the former of which went through six and the latter through five editions. In 1823 appeared his <span class="italic">Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar</span>, which was the earliest work of its kind in the English language. It showed no more scientific knowledge of the structure of the language than did the works of Hickes and Lye, from which it was compiled, but it served to awaken among English speakers an interest in the earliest form of their native tongue. In 1826 Bosworth published <span class="italic">A Compendious Grammar of the Primitive English or Anglo-Saxon Language</span>, an abridgement of the former work, with some improvements. The author had become acquainted with the epoch-making grammar of Rasmus Christian Rask (1787&#150;1832), and was able to correct several of the most important errors of the original <span class="italic">Elements</span>, though his grasp of the philological discoveries of the Danish scholar was very imperfect.<br>
<br>During his residence at Little Horwood, Bosworth took great interest in proposals for tackling poverty, and published several pamphlets on this subject. In 1829 he became chaplain in the Netherlands, first at Amsterdam and then in 1832 at Rotterdam. In 1831 the degree of PhD was conferred on him by the University of Leiden. He lived in the Netherlands until 1840, and made occasional visits to England. In 1834 he took the degree of BD at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1839 that of DD. While in the Netherlands Bosworth wrote his principal work, the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</span> (1838), to which is prefixed &#145;An essay on the origin of the English, German, and Scandinavian languages and nations&#146; (reprinted separately in 1848) and a sketch of Old English grammar. The latter, which is condensed from Rask and Grimm, is well arranged and in general accurate; but the dictionary itself shows that the author had only a very superficial acquaintance with the new philology. Nevertheless, despite its unscientific character, and its many errors of detail (partly due to the author's lack of access to English public libraries), the work was a great advance on previous dictionaries in English. Bosworth also published while in the Netherlands <span class="italic">The Origin of the Dutch, with a Sketch of their Language and Literature</span> (1836); <span class="italic">Scandinavian Literature</span> (1839); and a translation of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> into Dutch, the copyright of which he made over to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. In 1840 Bosworth became vicar of Waith in Lincolnshire, and in 1848 he published, under the title of <span class="italic">A Compendious Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon</span>, an abridgement of his larger work, omitting the references, but supplying many additional words and corrections (reprinted in 1852, 1855, 1859, and 1882). In 1855 he published an English translation of King Alfred's Old English version of <span class="italic">Orosius</span>, and also a facsimile of part of its two manuscripts, with a literal English translation and notes. In 1857 he was presented to the rectory of Water Stratford, in Buckinghamshire, and was incorporated a member of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1858 he was appointed Rawlinson professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, and in the following year he issued an edition of the Old English text of Alfred's <span class="italic">Orosius</span>. His only subsequent publication of importance was an edition in parallel columns of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon gospels, and the versions of Wycliffe and Tyndale.<br>
<br>Bosworth's works realized for him (according to his own statement quoted in <span class="italic">The Academy</span> of 10 June 1876) the sum of &pound;18,000. In 1867 he gave to the University of Cambridge &pound;10,000 to establish a professorship of Anglo-Saxon.<br>
<br>After being appointed professor, Bosworth resided either at Oxford or at his rectory of Water Stratford. He was married three times, though the details of his first wife are unknown. On 8 December 1853 he married, at Leckhampton, near Cheltenham, Anne Margaret Elrington (<i>d</i>. 1863), daughter of John Elliot and widow of Lieutenant-Colonel John Hamilton Elrington. After Anne's death he married, on 5 November 1867, Emily Stonhouse (<i>b</i>. 1821/2), widow of Henry Stonhouse, fellow of New College, Oxford. There were no children from his marriages. Until a few days before his death, which occurred when he was eighty-eight, at 20 Beaumont Street, Oxford, on 27 May 1876, he was accustomed to work from nine in the morning until six in the evening, principally on the new edition of his larger dictionary, the publication of which had been undertaken by the Clarendon Press. He also left a mass of annotations on the Anglo-Saxon charters. Bosworth was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a member of many learned societies both at home and abroad. He was buried in the churchyard of St Giles, Water Stratford, on 2 June 1876.<br>
<br>After Bosworth's death the Old English dictionary was committed by the delegates of the Clarendon Press to the editorship of Professor T. N. Toller, of Manchester, and the first and second instalments of the new edition appeared in 1882. Unfortunately Bosworth's material, much of which had already been printed, was very far behind current philological knowledge, and the work was received with general dissatisfaction, especially as the long-standing announcement of its appearance had prevented the preparation of any rival dictionary.<br>
