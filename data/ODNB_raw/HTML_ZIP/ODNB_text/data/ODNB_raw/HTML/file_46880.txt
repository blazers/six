<span class="headword">Dickinson, Sir  Arthur Lowes</span>  (1859&#150;1935), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 8 August 1859 at Langham Chambers, Marylebone, London, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32818/', "Lowes Cato Dickinson (1819&#150;1908)")</script>, a portrait painter, and his wife, Margaret Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams (<i>d</i>. 1882). Arthur's younger brother was the historian and fellow of King's College, Cambridge, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32815/', "Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson (1862&#150;1932)")</script>. Arthur was educated at Charterhouse School and at King's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first in mathematics in 1882. He then served his articles with the chartered accountants William Edwards, Jackson, and Browning, which was based in the City of London. In 1883 Dickinson won the first prize in the intermediate examination of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and joint first place in the final examinations (1886). He married in 1888 Mary Kathleen, daughter of William Jennings, manager of a finance company and actuary. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Dickinson joined with another City-based firm, in 1888, to form Lovelock, Whiffin, and Dickinson. Three years later he accepted the invitation from Edwin Waterhouse to take charge of Price Waterhouse's recently established American operations. Together with a number of other British accountants working in the United States, Dickinson helped to organize the newly developing American accountancy profession. Although the first professional association was established in 1886, progress had been slow. Dickinson served as president of the Federation of Societies of Public Accountants in 1904, and as secretary of the American Association of Public Accountants in 1905 helped to bring about the merger of those two bodies. Following his return to Britain in 1913, as partner in Price Waterhouse's London office, he continued his professional involvement, serving as a member of the ICAEW's council between 1914 and 1928.<br>
<br>While in the United States, Dickinson also made his mark in the development of financial reporting practices. One of Price Waterhouse's largest clients&#151;possibly the largest&#151;was the United States Steel Corporation. Dickinson collaborated with the company's controller, William J. Filbert, to produce solutions to financial reporting problems associated with the newly emerging conglomerate form of business organization. The company's accounts for 1902 attracted widespread recognition as representing major progress towards fuller and more meaningful financial disclosure, and of particular interest is the fact that they contained an early example of a group consolidated statement.<br>
<br>Substantial contributions were made by Dickinson to the accounting literature on both sides of the Atlantic. Presentations to the International Congress on Accounting at St Louis in 1904, and to the school of commerce, accounts, and finance, New York University, in 1905, are notable for their thoughtful analyses of the theory and practice of consolidated statement preparation. Together with two American professional colleagues, William M. Lybrand and Robert H. Montgomery, Dickinson did much to encourage the early widespread adoption of group financial reporting procedures in the United States. Curiously, he was not a prominent public advocate of these procedures following his return to Great Britain, and it is an interesting question whether he exerted any influence on his partner at Price Waterhouse, Gilbert Garnsey, who caused such a stir with his lecture &#145;Holding companies and their published accounts&#146;, presented to the London members of the ICAEW in 1922.<br>
<br>Dickinson was, however, an outspoken critic of a number of aspects of contemporary accounting practice. A widely published paper presented to the Royal Statistical Society in 1924 (Dickinson had become a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries as early as 1886) drew attention to the lack of business statistics published either for public consumption or for corporate shareholders. The importance of full publicity was also the subject of a paper published in 1926 which, in a climate of industrial unrest, argued the need to recognize the interests of the various partners in business as part of an endeavour to achieve a greater degree of co-operation between representatives of capital and labour.<br>
<br>Professional accounting examinations were thought by Dickinson to be narrow and technical in their content. <span class="italic">Accounting Practice and Procedure</span>, published in 1913, was designed to help rectify this situation by supplying a text which would provide accounting students and practitioners with a deeper understanding of the nature, scope, and limitations of accountancy. Dickinson's experience as a company director (directorships included the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company Ltd, the Alvis Car and Engineering Company Ltd, and the Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company Ltd) and as partner in an accounting practice, together with the possession of a high intellect, enabled him to combine theory with practice, so as to produce effective solutions to pressing accounting problems.<br>
<br>Dickinson was active in public service during the First World War as financial adviser, first to the controlled establishments division of the Ministry of Munitions, and later to the controller of coal mines. Other public appointments included membership of the Miners' Welfare Committee, the commerce degree committee of the University of London, and the board of governors of the London School of Economics. He was knighted in 1919 for government service during the war. He lived, towards the end of his life, at Alding, Grayswood, near Haslemere, in Surrey. He died at Queen Anne's Mansions, St James's Park, London, on 28 February 1935, and was survived by his wife.<br>
