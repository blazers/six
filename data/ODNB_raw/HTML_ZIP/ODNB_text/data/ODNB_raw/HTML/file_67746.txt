<span class="headword">Fetcham <span class="st"> [Peckham]</span>,  Peter  of</span> <span class="st"> [Pierre  d'Abernon]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1267&#150;1276), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, was probably born in Fetcham (or possibly Peckham), Surrey, a member of the d'Abernon or <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54495/', "d'Abenon family")</script> of Fetcham and nearby Stoke d'Abernon, which led to his being also called Peter, or Piere, de Abernun. He may have been the illegitimate son of Master Peter, rector of Fetcham. He first occurs in or before 1267&#150;8 as the author of <span class="italic">La lum[in]ere as lais</span> (&#145;The lamp for layfolk&#146;), a massive catechetical poem that began as a translation of Honorius of Autun's <span class="italic">Elucidarius</span>, but ended as a patchwork of other authorities. In it he calls himself Pierre, a clerk of little fame (<i>petit renum</i>); rubrics in two manuscripts name him as Master Peter &#145;de Pecchame&#146; or &#145;de Feccham&#146;. A colophon in York Minster Library, MS xvi.N.3, says that it was begun at Easter 1267 at Newark Priory in Surrey, and completed on 2 February 1268 at Oxford. It is not clear whether this statement refers to the composition of the poem or, as seems more probable, to its copying. Newark Priory was an Augustinian house, and Peter, or his copyist, may have been an Austin canon.<br>
<br>Of Fetcham's two remaining extant verse translations, his next probably was <span class="italic">Le secr&eacute; des secrez</span> (&#145;The secret of secrets&#146;). This combined portions of the pseudo-Aristotelian <span class="italic">Secretum secretorum</span> (prologue, advice to kings, and dietary) with portions of one or more other dietaries and an epilogue written by Peter himself. Fetcham was one of the earliest western vernacular translators of the immensely popular <span class="italic">Secretum secretorum</span>. In <span class="italic">Le secr&eacute; des secrez</span> he cites his <span class="italic">Lumere as lais</span> and calls himself &#145;Piere &hellip; who springs from those of Abernun&#146;  (Legge, <span class="italic">Anglo-Norman in the Cloisters</span>, 64), suggesting that he was illegitimate. Peter's third known work is <span class="italic">La vie Seint Richard evesques de Cycestre</span>, a verse translation of Ralph Bocking's <span class="italic">Life and Miracles</span> (<i>c</i>.1270) of St Richard of Wyche, bishop of Chichester. A canon of Chichester had sent a copy for &#145;Pieres de Fecham&#146; to translate into French, for the benefit of lay people. In his translation Fetcham claims &#145;Johan de Abernun&#146; (probably Sir John d'Abernon, who died in 1277) as his <i>patrun</i>. Since Peter added at the end of his poem two miracles that he said had occurred after the translation of the saint's body to a new shrine (16 June 1276), its editor plausibly dates the poem to 1276&#150;7.<br>
<br>Fetcham's subsequent career is uncertain. A master and a clerk, perhaps illegitimate, he is possibly to be identified with a presumably illegitimate contemporary of the same name known as &#145;Peter the son of Peter the parson&#146; (or rector) of &#145;Fechham&#146;, Surrey  (BL, Additional charter 5549). Peter the parson, who occurs in charters dating from 1235 or earlier to the 1260s or 1270s, had at least one other son, called Hugh &#145;de Fecham&#146;, who gave some land to Newark Priory  (BL, Additional charter 5543). This would seem to strengthen the identification of Peter the poet with Peter the parson's son; the latter does not, however, call himself &#145;Master&#146; Peter in his surviving deed  (BL, Additional charter 5549). It is also possible, but unlikely, that Peter of Fetcham (or Peckham) the poet is to be identified with another contemporary, <a name="cosubject_67746"></a><span class="headword">Peter  of Peckham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1293), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, known to have been illegitimate, who was probably born in or near West Peckham, Kent. When first recorded, in 1278/9, he held a tenancy in Wateringbury, Kent, near West Peckham, which he may have held since before 1264. He had at least one son, Simon, also presumably illegitimate, who was probably an adult by 1292. Since Peckham was unquestionably a university graduate, styled &#145;Master&#146; by 1279, these dates suggest that he had been born no later than the mid-1250s, and perhaps before 1240.<br>
<br>By 1282 Peckham was already a lawyer of standing. In that year Lewes Priory retained as its legal counsel &#145;our beloved clerk Master Peter of Peckam, professor of laws&#146;  (Beckerlegge, xiv, n. 3), with an annual pension of 10 marks. He was to be similarly retained by the priories of Christ Church, Canterbury, and Bermondsey, and by Bayham and Lesnes abbeys, though he sometimes had difficulty in obtaining payment of his pensions. In 1290/91, now described as the clerk of the king's treasurer, William March, he sued Lewes Priory for arrears, and settled for 50 marks. Peckham seems to have been a troublesome, perhaps a violent, man. In the Kent eyre of 1279 he was accused of having raped Matilda de Caldynge at Malling on 15 August 1270. Though acquitted, he subsequently found himself repeatedly at odds with his neighbours in Kent, against whom he brought a number of lawsuits, and by whom he was presented at the 1293 Kent eyre for having seized, fattened, and slaughtered for his own larder pigs which had strayed onto his land at Wateringbury. This time he was convicted, but as a clerk was handed over to the ordinary.<br>
<br>Peter of Peckham died on 21 August 1293, intestate as well as illegitimate, so that his possessions escheated to the crown. They included &pound;384 10<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. in cash, found in Boxley Abbey, Kent; a collection of canon and civil law books and a dispensation (perhaps for illegitimacy) deposited in Southwark and Bermondsey priories; and a messuage in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, London. In 1295 Edward I gave the books to his clerk, Itier d'Angoul&ecirc;me, who had previously granted Peckham his London messuage and who recovered it after Peckham's death. Four religious books once belonging to &#145;P. Pecham&#146; came into the library of Merton College, Oxford, but no connection has been traced between Peckham and the college. In 1294 Peckham's son Simon successfully sued to recover seisin of 2 acres of wood at Mereworth, near West Peckham, which had formerly been held by his father.<br>
