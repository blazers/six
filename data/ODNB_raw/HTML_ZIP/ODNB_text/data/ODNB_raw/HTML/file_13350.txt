<span class="headword">Hine,  Henry George</span>  (1811&#150;1895), <span class="occ">comic artist and landscape painter</span>, born at Brighton, Sussex, on 15 August 1811, was the son of a coachman, William Hine, and his wife, Mary Roffey. He was entirely self-taught as an artist, though he was encouraged in his study of nature by a vicar of a neighbouring Sussex village, who had a collection of watercolours by Copley Fielding, whose style strongly influenced Hine's own. Hine made his name in Sussex with seapieces and scenes of the coast near Brighton before moving to London, where he was apprenticed as a draughtsman to the engraver Henry Meyer. He then spent two years in France, at Rouen, developing his skills in oil painting, before returning again to Brighton. On 13 November 1840 he married Mary Ann Eliza (<i>b</i>. 1818/19), daughter of James Egerton, a coach maker; they had ten daughters and four sons.<br>
<br>Not finding the commissions he desired, Hine moved once more to London, where he became a professional wood-engraver. In 1841 he was discovered by Ebenezer Landells, who at that time was projecting the publication of a landscape periodical called <span class="italic">The Cosmorama</span>. Pleased with a little comic sketch by Hine of a dustman and his dog, Landells recommended that he become a contributor to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, the first number of which had appeared on 17 July 1841. Hine's first contribution appeared in September and he continued to work for <span class="italic">Punch</span> until 1844, supplying &#145;blackies&#146; (black comic sketches) and cartoons. Thereafter, he contributed to several short-lived rival publications, such as <span class="italic">Puck</span>, <span class="italic">Joe Miller the Younger</span>, and the <span class="italic">Man in the Moon</span>, as well as to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, before returning to landscape painting. His favourite subject remained the Sussex countryside of his youth (which he depicted, according to the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span> in 1893, with &#145;something of a geologist's knowledge of the land&#146;), though he did paint many scenes of Northumberland and London, as well.<br>
<br>Between 1830 and 1851 Hine had sent six pictures to the Royal Academy; he also sent twelve to the Suffolk Street Gallery, including, in 1856, <span class="italic">Picts Wall in Carrfield Crags, Northumberland</span>. By 1861 he had sent eight works to the Royal Academy, the most successful of which was <span class="italic">Wrecks on the Beach at Brighton</span> (exh. 1861). In 1863 Hine was elected as associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and exhibited there <span class="italic">St. Paul's from Fleet Street</span>. He was elected a full member in 1864, and became a regular contributor to the Institute (from 1885 Royal Institute) of Painters in Water Colours, even serving as vice-president from 1884 to 1895. Hine died at his home, 4 Gayton Crescent, Hampstead, London, on 16 March 1895.<br>
