<span class="headword">Sandberg,  Alexander Christer Edward <span class="st"> [Alec]</span></span>  (1923&#150;2008), <span class="occ">civil and structural engineer</span>, was born on 31 July 1923 at 3 Cadogan Place, Chelsea, London, the son of Oscar Fridolf Alexander Sandberg (1878/9&#150;1940), civil engineer, and his wife, Audrey Maude Edward, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Furber (1899&#150;1980). He was born into a Swedish rail engineering dynasty that was established in the 1860s after his grandfather, Christer Peter Sandberg, emigrated to England. The firm flourished for two generations by providing international consultancy services during the golden age of railway engineering.<br>
<br>Sandberg, usually known as Alec, progressed from Charterhouse School in 1940 to City and Guilds Engineering College, South Kensington, later part of Imperial College, London. In the early part of the Second World War he volunteered to work as an air raid warden and was subsequently involved in firefighting and ambulance driving. Although initially granted deferment from the armed forces for education he eventually joined the Royal Engineers in 1943 and a year later was sent to Burma, where he brought to bear his extensive knowledge of railways to assist in the reconstruction of its rail industry after the war.<br>
<br>In 1950 Sandberg joined the family firm at a time when its lucrative rail consultancy work had virtually ceased. Appointed senior partner in 1955, he remodelled the firm into a specialist materials testing organization, working closely and profitably with the Ministry of Transport on motorway contracts. On 19 October 1957, at St Michael's Church, Chester Square, Pimlico, London, he married Aline Isobel Duncan (<i>b</i>. 1929), daughter of William Edmonstone Duncan, army officer. They had three sons, Michael, Christopher, and Neil.<br>
<br>Under Sandberg's leadership the practice expanded to a staff of 400 with specialists in specific materials. The firm was able to play a leading role in the aftermath of the box-girder bridge difficulties (caused by the collapse of three bridges in 1970&#150;71) and was able to advise design consultants for the Milford Haven (later Cleddau), Severn, Wye, Erskine, and Humber bridges. Expertise in testing for steel corrosion in reinforced or pre-stressed concrete was also developed about this time. In tandem with this development were additional contracts on suspension bridges, ports, railways, and other civil engineering projects in Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Bahrain, and Dubai. In particular he helped to resolve a dispute between designer and contractor over the quality of concrete used in the Tsing Ma bridge in Hong Kong. He was also much in demand as an expert witness in fraud cases centring around the alleged use of poor-quality concrete.<br>
<br>Sandberg's forward-looking approach ensured that the firm was always abreast of developments like the property boom of the late 1980s, which included the vast reconstruction of the old dock areas of Canary Wharf and the explosion of refurbishment schemes. He was involved in the restoration of Windsor Castle after the fire of 20 November 1992, Nelson's Column, Eros in Piccadilly, and the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park.<br>
<br>Sandberg was a founder member of the executive committee of the British group of the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering, and helped organize various Henderson symposia at Cambridge University, where his extensive overseas connections helped to recruit knowledgeable engineers from outside the UK to the meetings. He chaired the organizing committees of the colloquia on liability (1984) and rehabilitation and renovation (1987). He was subsequently appointed a member of honour in recognition of his achievements for the committee. In 1998 he was appointed OBE for his services to civil engineering. He was influential as a member and sometime chairman of the organization known colloquially as the French Civils. This was a group of Francophile British engineers who were affiliated to the Conseil National des Ing&eacute;nieurs et des Scientifiques de France. A man with an irrepressible sense of humour, it is reported that on one occasion he had gone ahead to make arrangements for a visit of the group to France. He arranged for the coach driver to pick him up from the side of the road, posing as a Breton onion seller, complete with striped shirt, onions, and false moustache.<br>
<br>It was a characteristic of Sandberg that his jokes were usually at his own expense&#151;rarely did he offend any of his associates or even his opponents. However, those who might be encouraged to take advantage of his easy-going manner could be surprised by his acute sense of business and the depth of his engineering knowledge. Behind his smile was a profound knowledge of his subject, whether it was engineering, contract bridge, or things of the heart. His calm and sensitive humour defused many a tense meeting where tempers were in danger of becoming frayed. Above all, he had the gift of making engineering seem fun. He died at his home, 16 Thames Quay, Chelsea Harbour, London, on 1 August 2008 after a long period of relatively poor health. He was survived by his wife, Aline, and their three sons. His well-attended memorial service was held at St Michael's Church, Chester Square, London, on 2 October 2008.<br>
