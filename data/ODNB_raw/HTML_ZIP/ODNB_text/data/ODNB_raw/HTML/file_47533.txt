<span class="headword">Greg,  Henry Philips</span>  (1865&#150;1936), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at Lode Hill, Styal, near Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 13 August 1865, the only son (there were also five daughters) of Henry Russell Greg (1832&#150;1894) and his wife Emily <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gair. His childhood was spent at Lode Hill, and he was educated first at Rugby School and later at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1898 he married Jane Emily, daughter of Frederick Lewis Diblee, a civil engineer. They had one son and four daughters. He was a Unitarian, and was treasurer of Manchester College, Oxford and a trustee of the <span class="italic">Hibbert Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Greg began work in 1887 at Albert Mill, Reddish, near Stockport, a mill built in 1847 by his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11444/', "Robert Hyde Greg")</script>, for spinning and doubling cotton. In 1856 Robert Hyde Greg was joined in partnership by his third son, Henry Russell Greg. On Robert Hyde Greg's death, in 1875, H. R. Greg took control, in partnership with Charles Sharpe Parker. On Henry Russell Greg's death, in 1894, Henry Philips Greg became sole partner in R. Greg &amp; Co. of Reddish. He expanded and modernized the mill, shifting production towards fancy yarns used in upholstery, and replaced flyer throstles and mule spindles with ring spindles. These moves later ensured the mill's competitive success in the 1920s and 1930s.<br>
<br>A Liberal in politics Greg was a committed free-trader who, for many years, was treasurer of the Knutsford Division Liberal Association, and an active member of the North Western Free Trade Union. He disliked government intervention of all kinds, and was especially opposed to any idea of state intervention to alleviate the problems of over-capacity and obsolescence, which beset the cotton industry in the inter-war period. It fixed internal minimum prices, established the Cotton Industry Board as the means of control, and as the institution for orchestrating change in the industry. Deploring any measures that would restrict competition, Greg believed instead that the way forward lay in the fundamental modernization of the industry.<br>
<br>Greg was, therefore, in the vanguard of technological innovation in the cotton industry at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1904, on behalf of Ashton Brothers Ltd of which he became chairman in 1907, he visited the United States and arranged for 500 automatic looms to be imported. As a result of this initiative the British Northrop Loom Company was established, and Greg became its chairman. Keen to enhance the competitiveness of the British cotton industry by improving the quality of research and development, he was instrumental in establishing the British Cotton Industry Research Association. In addition he was involved in setting up the research laboratories at the Shirley Institute at Didsbury in south Manchester. In an article in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Textile Institute</span>, co-authored with W. Morton and entitled &#145;The cotton textile industry in the United States&#146;, he outlined what he saw as the virtues of the &#145;American System&#146; of manufacturing as it applied to the cotton industry. He traced the organizational, managerial, and technological features of cotton manufacturing in the United States and pointed to the productivity advantages which this brought.<br>
<br>Greg believed that business efficiency depended on both technological superiority and human capital investment. In line with family tradition, he was a paternalist in his labour and community relations. In Styal he fulfilled the role of the local squire and, at the time, when Quarry Bank Mill (his cousin Edward Hyde Greg's mill) was being run down, and when morale in the village was low, he tried to revitalize the community by setting up the Village Club. This was intended to provide an alternative source of entertainment to the local public house, The Ship inn, which he had inherited from his father&#151;somewhat to his embarrassment&#151;as he saw excessive drink as the major social curse. Accordingly, he limited all customers to two glasses of beer, using the profits to fund the club, where villagers could read, play games, attend debates and classes, and give concerts. He valued the Styal community, and allowed no speculative building. As a consequence, somewhat ironically for one so keen on modernization, he bitterly opposed the building of the new Ringway airport, which after the Second World War was to become Manchester airport, and which involved the compulsory purchase of some of his land. At Reddish, for his own workforce, he developed a range of welfare schemes, adding playing fields and a recreation room, and appointed a welfare secretary in 1915. He died at his home, Lode Hill, Styal, on 3 June 1936, and was buried at Dean Row Chapel in Styal.<br>
