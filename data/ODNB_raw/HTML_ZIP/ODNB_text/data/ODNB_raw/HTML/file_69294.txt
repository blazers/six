<span class="headword">France, Sir  Arnold William</span>  (1911&#150;1998), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 20 April 1911 at St John's Road, Knutsford, Cheshire, the only son, and oldest child, of William Ernest France (1880&#150;1939), bank manager, and his wife, Catherine Moncrieff, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ames (1879&#150;1963), teacher of dancing. He was a boarder at Bishop's Stortford College (1924&#150;8). In 1929 he followed his father into the District Bank, where he worked for eleven years in the Manchester area, sometimes looking after small branches in the Peak District. On 27 April 1940 he married Frances Margaret Linton Palmer (1913&#150;1998), whom he had met on a walking tour in Austria. She was the daughter of Dr J. C. L. Palmer.<br>
<br>It was during the Second World War that France first began to show distinction. Conscripted into the Royal Corps of Signals in 1940, he served for three years with the Sudan defence force. Transferred to Cairo, and on the basis of his banking experience, he was seconded to be deputy economic and financial adviser to the minister of state, Middle East. He made such an impression that in 1945 he gained a place at the Treasury as a principal. He was then assigned mainly to overseas finance and became assistant secretary in 1948 and under-secretary in 1952. He became third secretary in 1960, and worked with Edward Heath on Britain's abortive application to join the European Common Market.<br>
<br>Transferred to the Ministry of Health as deputy secretary in 1963, at a time when an expensive recasting of the National Health Service was being considered, France was permanent secretary between 1964 and 1968. The system of primary health care had rested on individual medical practices and standard payments to doctors. Under the 1966 charter of general practice a range of special payments encouraged the development of group practice, the building of new and well-equipped surgeries, and the hiring of ancillary nursing staff. As right hand man to Kenneth Robinson, the minister of health, and with the authority of an ex-Treasury official France was crucial to the successful outcome of the negotiations with the medical profession. He was appointed KCB in 1965. Between 1968 and 1972 he was chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue. As chairman he focused on management and staff relations, rather than on detailed tax policy, and oversaw the opening of the Inland Revenue's first computer centre at East Kilbride. He was advanced to GCB in 1972.<br>
<br>After retiring from the public service in 1973 France was a director of Pilkington Brothers (1973&#150;81), Tube Investments (1973&#150;81), and the Rank Organization (1973&#150;83). He lived at Lingfield, Surrey, from 1948 until his death. Between 1973 and 1981 he was chairman of the board of management of Lingfield Hospital school, where the needs of multi-handicapped children with epilepsy were very close to his heart. He was a committed Anglican, and for many years churchwarden and treasurer of his local church. Between 1973 and 1978 he was chairman of the Church of England's central board of finance, presenting sets of figures in a way even the least numerate could follow. In all his activities he worked towards consensus by listening and persuading, but succeeded in getting effective and timely results.<br>
<br>France was a devoted family man, with four daughters, and, towards the end of his life, seven grandchildren. He died on 2 January 1998 at Ashurst Park, Fordcombe Road, Langton Green, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, following a stroke. The funeral and cremation were on 12 January 1998 at St John the Evangelist, Blindley Heath, Surrey, where his ashes were later interred. His widow died on 22 December 1998. They were survived by their four daughters.<br>
