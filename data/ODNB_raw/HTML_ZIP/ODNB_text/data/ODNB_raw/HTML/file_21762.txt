<span class="headword">Peel,  Paul</span>  (1860&#150;1892), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 7 November 1860 at London, Ontario, Canada, to English parents. His artistic ambitions were encouraged by his father, a marble cutter and drawing instructor, and he received his first formal training at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He was elected a member of the Ontario Society of Artists in 1880, in which year he left for Europe. He studied for a time at the Royal Academy before moving to Pont-Aven in Brittany where, in the first part of 1881, he produced the religious work <span class="italic">Devotion</span>. Later that year he settled in Paris and in 1882 enrolled at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, studying under Jean-Leon G&eacute;r&ocirc;me. He afterwards made only occasional short sojourns in his native country. His art was entirely French in character and he was a successful exhibitor at the salon of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Artistes Fran&ccedil;ais, gaining a third-class medal in 1891 for his large picture <span class="italic">After the Bath</span>. The previous year he had obtained honourable mention for <span class="italic">Life is Bitter</span>. Seven of his works were included in the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886 and the prince of Wales was among his English patrons. Peel's favourite subjects were taken from the nursery, but during the summer months he used to work <i>en plein air</i> in the northern provinces of France. He was an excellent colourist and a master of delicate effects of light. He established a notable reputation in Europe during his brief lifetime and was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy in 1890. He died in Paris on 3 October 1892, leaving a widow and one son.<br>
