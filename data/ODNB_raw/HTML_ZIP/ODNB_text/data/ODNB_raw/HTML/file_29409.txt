<span class="headword">Wilfrid</span> <span class="st"> [St Wilfrid]</span>  (<em>c.</em>634&#150;709/10), <span class="occ">bishop of Hexham</span>, played a central role in the political and ecclesiastical life of later seventh-century England.<h2>
<a name="UpbringingandfirstjourneytoRome"></a>Upbringing and first journey to Rome</h2>Born the son of a minor Northumbrian nobleman, Wilfrid was sent at the age of fourteen to the court of the Northumbrian king Oswiu (<i>d</i>. 670). There he first demonstrated his ability to elicit the patronage of the great, a quality he retained throughout his life, by attracting the attention of Queen Eanfl&aelig;d, who placed him at Lindisfarne under the monk Cudda, a former companion of her husband. Within a few years he was sent by Eanfl&aelig;d to her kinsman, King Eorcenberht of Kent, at whose court he lived for a year or so before taking up with another of the queen's associates, the Northumbrian Biscop Baducing (later Benedict Biscop), in order to make the pilgrimage to Rome. When, about 653, he and Biscop arrived at Lyons, they parted company, not perhaps entirely amicably, Biscop continuing to Rome and Wilfrid remaining under the patronage of the bishop, Aunemund (known to Wilfrid's biographer, Stephen of Ripon (Eddius Stephanus), as Dalfinus). According to Stephen, who is not entirely to be trusted on this matter, the bishop offered to marry Wilfrid to his niece and make him governor of a Frankish province. Wilfrid, however, rejected his offer and proceeded to Rome. The buildings, ceremonies, and above all the relics of the Holy See had an enormous impact upon the impressionable young pilgrim. He made daily visits to the shrines of the martyrs and conceived (or at least consolidated) there what was to prove a lifelong devotion to the apostolic brothers Peter and Andrew, vowing, before St Andrew's altar in the rotunda attached to St Peter's, to become, like them, an evangelist. Almost as formative was his education in the most recent teaching about the calculation of Easter and other matters of ecclesiastical observance by the archdeacon Boniface with whom he evidently struck up a close friendship. In due course, having been presented to the pope and in possession of a collection of relics, he returned to Lyons. There, according to Stephen of Ripon, he remained for three years, during which he received the tonsure and was further instructed in orthodox practice. More fantastically, Stephen also alleges that he was present at Aunemund's murder, a chronological impossibility since Wilfrid had returned to England by the end of 658 and the murder did not take place until 660. Nevertheless, whatever the precise course of events at Lyons, there can be little doubt that Wilfrid's early visits there left an impression almost as profound as Rome itself, and had a lasting impact upon his notions of episcopal authority and status.<h2>
<a name="RiponAbbeyandtheNorthumbrianbishopricc658669"></a>Ripon Abbey and the Northumbrian bishopric, c.658&#150;669</h2>On his return to England, Wilfrid was recommended by the West Saxon king, Cenwalh, to Oswiu's son, the <i>regulus</i> (under-king) Alchfrith, by whom he was granted the monastery of Ripon and estates assessed at 40 hides. The monks recently installed there, who included the young Cuthbert and his abbot Eata, were expelled, to be replaced at Wilfrid's invitation by Abbot Tondbehrt and his kinsman Ceolfrith, both from the important royal foundation at Gilling in Northumbria.<br>
<br>In 663 Wilfrid reaffirmed his continental connections by seeking ordination at the hands of the Frankish Agilbert, former bishop of the West Saxons. The young abbot's rising reputation was boosted in 664 when, in conjunction with Agilbert, he proved a skilful spokesman for the victorious Roman party at the Synod of Whitby. By then, however, Wilfrid was making enemies as well as friends. His intrusion into Ripon was almost certainly controversial and the departure of Bishop Colman of Lindisfarne and a substantial portion of his household in the aftermath of Whitby also aroused hostility in powerful quarters within the Northumbrian establishment. Nevertheless, when shortly afterwards the see of Northumbria again became vacant, Alchfrith was able to secure Wilfrid's appointment, with a view to removing the see centre from the now discredited Lindisfarne to Paulinus's church at York. Characteristically, Wilfrid sought unimpeachably orthodox credentials before entering into his inheritance; deeming there to be insufficient bishops in England to perform a valid consecration, he obtained the consent of Oswiu and Alchfrith to go to Francia, where, during a splendid ceremony at the Merovingian royal palace of Compi&egrave;gne, presided over by his friend Agilbert and eleven other bishops, he was publicly enthroned and carried shoulder-high in a golden chair. The episode is a clear illustration of the continuing impact of the ideals and aesthetic of episcopal grandeur which Wilfrid had imbibed during his earlier sojourn at Lyons.<br>
<br>According to Bede, Wilfrid &#145;lingered&#146; abroad seeking consecration. Certainly he seems not to have returned until 666 and then was further delayed when his ship was beached on the pagan shore of Sussex, a potential catastrophe from which he and his followers emerged with honours, having slain the high priest and fought off the South Saxon host before escaping with the returning tide. When the new bishop eventually reached Northumbria, he found his position much changed: his patron Alchfrith had been eclipsed and he himself had been superseded at York by Ceadda (Chad), a figure strongly linked with Lindisfarne. Wilfrid was forced to withdraw to his monastery of Ripon, his base for the next three years from which, resourceful as ever, he exercised his episcopal authority in Mercia and Kent by permission of their friendly kings. In Mercia in particular he seems to have acquired considerable estates from Wulfhere, on which he established religious communities, including perhaps Oundle, where he dedicated a church to St Andrew. The situation was resolved only in 669 after the arrival at Canterbury of a new archbishop, Theodore. Wilfrid was restored to his see and Ceadda, who was consecrated afresh, was made bishop of the Mercians. According to Stephen of Ripon, Ceadda's appointment was largely due to Wilfrid's good offices, his see being based upon the great estate of Lichfield, initially granted to Wilfrid himself. Doubtless, Wilfrid wished to remove a potential rival from the Northumbrian scene; but even so the episode points to a certain large-mindedness, apparent elsewhere in his career.<h2>
<a name="Episcopalpoweronthecontinentalmodel669678"></a>Episcopal power on the continental model, 669&#150;678</h2>The years which followed his restoration, 669&#150;678, were Wilfrid's most successful and illustrate his aims and ideals most clearly. In accordance with what he had seen in Francia, he replaced the remote island monastery of Lindisfarne with a genuine see city; Paulinus's cathedral at York was splendidly brought back from ruin, adorned with glass windows, whitewashed walls, and new fittings. At Ripon, Wilfrid invested yet more heavily in building, constructing there a new church of stone, dedicated to St Peter at an elaborate ceremony conducted according to Gallic rites and attended by King Ecgfrith and his brother &AElig;lfwine. In addition, by 672 his ecclesiastical patrimony was enriched with the grant by Ecgfrith's queen, &AElig;thelthryth, of a large estate at Hexham, where Wilfrid founded his second great monastery and built another stone church, remarkable for its grandeur and complexity and dedicated to his especial patron, St Andrew. The new buildings reflected Wilfrid's travels. Although vague and confusing, Stephen of Ripon's descriptions suggest that they were aisled basilicas, no doubt influenced by the great churches Wilfrid had seen in Rome and elsewhere; indeed in the twelfth century returning pilgrims expressly declared that the church at Hexham re-created the splendours of the Holy See.<br>
<br>Wilfrid intended the contents of these churches also to evoke what he had seen abroad. Above all, they were to house relics of the Roman martyrs in an appropriate environment; the strange surviving crypts are perhaps best explained as an attempt to re-create the catacombs in which Wilfrid had seen the corporeal remains of the saints whose relics he had brought back to England. Other objects, equally redolent of Frankish or Roman magnificence, included the gospel book commissioned for Ripon, with its purple-stained pages and letters of gold, the jewelled shrine in which it was stored, and the gold, silver, and purple hangings and altar vestments which adorned his two great churches.<br>
<br>The liturgy within these churches looked to the same cultural milieux. Like Benedict Biscop, Wilfrid was particularly concerned to enhance their ceremonial with appropriate music, bringing to Ripon in the late 660s a Kentish singing master trained in the Roman tradition, the first to practise there since the early seventh century. The importance which the bishop attached to his liturgical achievements is apparent from the fact that, when defending himself at a hostile council some thirty-five years later, he expressly claimed to have introduced into Northumbria the double choir to sing liturgical antiphons and responsions &#145;according to the rite of the primitive church&#146;  (Eddius Stephanus, <span class="italic">Life of Bishop Wilfrid</span>, c.47). Equally significant was his claim to have been the first Northumbrian to patronize the rule of St Benedict, which he promoted in his two great houses and in the numerous other communities which placed themselves under his direction. His own monastic observance, however, was almost certainly coloured by customs imbibed in the Frankish milieux whose eclectic rules provided his earliest introduction to Benedict's work.<br>
<br>Wilfrid was also one of the first English churchmen to appreciate the importance of the written charter as a means of guaranteeing monastic possessions. He caused a list of the gifts made to Ripon to be written down, witnessed, and publicly read at the dedication ceremony and from the 670s he seems to have been associated with a number of innovative charters which adopt a new incarnational dating linked with the <span class="roman">Dionysiac Easter tables</span>. He thereby championed two important practices which he encountered abroad: written authentication of land grants and the <span class="roman">Easter tables</span> so recently introduced into Rome.<br>
<br>During these successful years Wilfrid enlarged his monastic connection. His possessions increased as Ecgfrith expanded the boundaries of his kingdom; besides his two great houses of Ripon and Hexham, he acquired lands in and to the west of the Pennines, formerly held by the Britons, and in the conquered territories of the Picts and Scots to the north. Moreover, his monastic connection continued to transcend political boundaries; indeed, in the 670s he probably added to his holdings outside Northumbria, in particular in the kingdom of the Hwicce. Wilfrid's pretensions at that period are indicated by his claim at the Roman synod, convened by Pope Agatho to condemn Monotheletism in 680, to represent the whole of northern Britannia and Hibernia, and the islands settled by the English, British, Scots, and Picts. That he could indeed mobilize wide-ranging contacts is indicated by his response in 676 to a request from the Franks of Austrasia to secure the return from Ireland of the exiled Merovingian prince, Dagobert. Wilfrid more than fulfilled his task, sending Dagobert on his way with a suitable entourage drawn from his own followers. He was then, it seems, in especially close contact with Irish communities which observed the Roman Easter, for only shortly afterwards his monk Willibrord left Ripon to settle among them for a prolonged period of study.<br>
<br>Although Stephen of Ripon dilates upon Wilfrid's temporal glories&#151;his innumerable followers arrayed in royal vestments and arms, his many monasteries, his personal wealth&#151;he also stresses his hero's personal asceticism and pastoral assiduity. Wilfrid is depicted as modelling himself on biblical prophets and apostles, travelling around his diocese, baptizing and confirming in accordance with current models of episcopal sanctity. Though he apparently ordained numerous priests and deacons to help him in the administration of the sacraments, significantly, he consecrated no episcopal coadjutors. Probably he felt that his vast see was best left undivided if he was to maintain the outward show he believed appropriate to his office. As a result he never, as might have been expected, sought the revival of Gregory the Great's scheme for a northern metropolitan with twelve subordinate bishops, nor, apparently, did he openly challenge Theodore's growing pretensions, which culminated in his assumption of the title of archbishop of the island of Britain in 679 or 680. On the other hand Wilfrid certainly aspired to an independence greater than the bishops south of the Humber: in 672, for example, he merely sent legates to the synod which Theodore convened at Hertford. Above all, his claim to represent northern Britain at the synod of 680 looks like a covert assertion of metropolitan, even archiepiscopal, authority. It may be that Wilfrid's fall frustrated (or indeed was precipitated by) such grandiose plans and that he was never thereafter in a position to revive them. That, however, they were not forgotten is perhaps suggested by Stephen's twice referring to York's metropolitan status.<br>
<br>It is significant that Wilfrid never sought to buttress the case for a northern ecclesiastical province by appealing to the authority of Pope Gregory the Great. Interestingly, the cult of the apostle of the English was most vigorously promoted by Wilfrid's opponents; like his Roman mentors, Wilfrid himself appears to have been comparatively uninterested in Gregory, whose teachings on episcopal rule, based as they were upon small dioceses and an avoidance of show, conflicted with his Frankish-derived notions of episcopal power and splendour.<h2>
<a name="DepositionandfirstappealtoRome67868081"></a>Deposition and first appeal to Rome, 678&#150;680/81</h2>In 678 Wilfrid's fortunes underwent a dramatic reversal: Ecgfrith turned against him and he was driven from Northumbria. The reasons for the king's change of attitude are unclear. Possibly they were connected with Wilfrid's friendly relations with the kings of Mercia with whom Northumbria was generally at variance in the later 670s. A powerful interest within the Northumbrian establishment focused on the great royal foundation of Strensall&#150;Whitby was also hostile to Wilfrid; Strensall&#150;Whitby's abbess, Hild, not only supported the Lindisfarne community at the synod of 664 and Archbishop Theodore in Rome in 680, but had connections with monasteries and aristocrats in western Francia, bitterly opposed to Wilfrid's Austrasian (eastern Frankish) friends. Above all, Ecgfrith himself had strong personal reasons for disliking his bishop, who had supported his first queen, &AElig;thelthryth, in her determination to remain celibate. After she had received the veil from Wilfrid in 672 the king married again, and, according to Stephen of Ripon, his new consort sought to undermine Wilfrid by making the king envious of his outstanding riches. In a deliberate act of provocation, Archbishop Theodore was called in to divide the great Northumbrian diocese. New sees were established at Ripon and Hexham, under figures unsympathetic to Wilfrid and his followers, and York itself was given to a pupil of Hild of Strensall&#150;Whitby, the bishop's old enemy.<br>
<br>Wilfrid determined to appeal in person to the pope against his deprivation and set out for Rome on a leisurely and circuitous progress, apparently intended to avoid the lands of the hostile Ebroin, mayor of the palace and effective ruler of Neustria (western Francia). Having crossed to Frisia, where he paused to preach to the heathen inhabitants, the bishop made his way to the court of his friend Dagobert II, then king of Austrasia, where he was offered and refused the see of Strasbourg. By 679 he had arrived in Rome, where preparations for the synod which was to condemn the Monothelete heresy were in progress. There he claimed (with justification) to have been uncanonically deprived of his see and sought full restitution, or, if that was denied, that any new sees should be occupied by men drawn from the clergy of his churches. The pope and council found in Wilfrid's favour, but worded their judgment with considerable care. Wilfrid was to be restored to the diocese which he had lately held and with the aid of a church council was to choose fellow bishops who were to be consecrated by Theodore. The intruding bishops were to be expelled. Pope Agatho thus allowed Wilfrid a special position in the north but stopped short of awarding him metropolitan status. Wilfrid's position was, however, further strengthened by a privilege exempting his monasteries from the authority of the diocesan and ascribing them directly to the Holy See.<br>
<br>Armed with this verdict Wilfrid returned to Northumbria. Ecgfrith was, however, unmoved by the pope's judgments, and according to Stephen of Ripon cast his former bishop into prison, an episode ignored by Bede and difficult to accommodate with evidence that by 680 Wilfrid had departed to Mercia. The exile was given land for a small monastery by Berhtwald, nephew of King &AElig;thelred and probably sub-king of a Mercian dependency in north Wessex. Those arrangements were, however, soon terminated by pressure from Ecgfrith and perhaps from the West Saxon king, Centwine, Ecgfrith's brother-in-law. Wilfrid, his fortunes at their lowest ebb, was forced to take refuge in Sussex. The Mercians' only concession to their former prot&eacute;g&eacute; was to allow Oshere, king of the Hwicce, to grant land at Ripple (in modern Worcestershire), originally given to the monastery of Ripon, to one of his monks.<h2>
<a name="ConversionofSussexandbishopoftheWestSaxons68081686"></a>Conversion of Sussex and bishop of the West Saxons, 680/81&#150;686</h2>When Wilfrid arrived in Sussex in 680 or 681, the king, &AElig;thelwalh, and his people were, according to Stephen of Ripon, entirely pagan. Bede, however, relates that &AElig;thelwalh himself had married a Christian princess and accepted the Christian faith at the instigation of Wulfhere of Mercia some five to ten years earlier; he also mentions, somewhat dismissively, a little community of Irish monks at Bosham, the later history of which suggests that it may have been more important than he allowed. Nevertheless, Wilfrid must be credited with a major role in converting the still largely pagan population of Sussex. He was able to capitalize on a severe drought, the end of which apparently coincided with his arrival in the kingdom. Characteristically making the most of his opportunities, he not only urged the new faith upon a people who felt deserted by their ancient gods with notable persuasiveness, but also taught practical remedies, in particular new methods of fishing, to counteract the famine which the drought had induced. When &AElig;thelwalh gave Wilfrid a large estate at Selsey, upon which he established a monastery, he further insinuated the new religion by manumitting all the slaves.<br>
<br>Some time in the early 680s Wilfrid seems to have transferred his allegiance to C&aelig;dwalla, an exiled and still pagan prince of the West Saxons who invaded Sussex and slew &AElig;thelwalh. When C&aelig;dwalla became king of the West Saxons in 685, he summoned Wilfrid, making him bishop in his kingdom and giving him 300 hides in the newly conquered Isle of Wight. The South Saxons, who quickly regained their independence, were it seems abandoned or subjected to the West Saxon bishopric, while the still pagan inhabitants of the Isle of Wight were placed under the care of Wilfrid's nephew Beornwine, who was one of his clergy, and the priest Hiddila. This murky episode, which scarcely redounds to Wilfrid's credit, is treated with considerable circumspection by both Bede and Stephen of Ripon.<h2>
<a name="ReneweddissensionandsecondappealtoRome686705"></a>Renewed dissension and second appeal to Rome, 686&#150;705</h2>Shortly after his removal to Wessex, Wilfrid's fortunes changed yet further for the better. With the death of Ecgfrith in 685, the elderly archbishop, Theodore, determined to make peace and in 686 he sent letters recommending a settlement to the new king of Northumbria, Aldfrith, to Abbess &AElig;lffl&aelig;d of Whitby (who appears to have inherited her predecessor's mantle as leader of the anti-Wilfridians), and to &AElig;thelred of Mercia. According to Stephen of Ripon, Theodore also sought to nominate Wilfrid his successor at Canterbury, an offer which Wilfrid magnanimously suggested was best referred to a church council.<br>
<br>Aldfrith fell in with the archbishop's proposals and Wilfrid was restored to his privileged monasteries of Hexham and Ripon and to the diocese of York, from which the intruder Bosa was expelled. His new diocese was, however, only a shadow of the great see which he had administered in the 670s. To the south Lindsey had been lost to Mercia and to the north Abercorn to the Picts. Moreover, in Bernicia the sees of Lindisfarne and Hexham, created since 678, remained in being. Although Wilfrid administered both temporarily for about a year, following the deaths of their bishops, Eata and Cuthbert, by 688 both sees had new incumbents. The partial nature of the settlement made further dissension inevitable and matters came to a head in 691, according to Stephen of Ripon because of the king's insistence on implementing the late archbishop's controversial decrees and more especially because of plans to despoil the monastery of Ripon of its lands and turn it into an episcopal see. By 692 Wilfrid had left for Mercia, and Bosa, it seems, had been restored to York.<br>
<br>Wilfrid remained in Mercia under the protection of King &AElig;thelred for some eleven years, serving as bishop at Leicester and assisting in the translation ceremonies at Ely of his friend and patron, the queen&#150;abbess &AElig;thelthryth. In 703 Berhtwald, Theodore's successor at Canterbury, presided over a church council which, with Aldfrith's consent, sought to resolve Wilfrid's anomalous position by depriving him of all his possessions except the monastery of Ripon, where he was to remain without exercising his episcopal office.<br>
<br>In consultation with &AElig;thelred, who continued to guarantee Ripon's Mercian endowments, Wilfrid determined on a further appeal to Rome, a move to which his enemies responded by excommunicating him and all his supporters. By 704 both Wilfrid and his party and the envoys of Archbishop Berhtwald were in Rome. Basing himself on earlier papal judgments in his favour, Wilfrid appealed to Pope John VI (<i>r</i>. 701&#150;5) for a confirmation of Agatho's privilege for his two great monasteries. The pope found Wilfrid personally guiltless of the charges alleged against him and confirmed the judgments of his predecessors; anxious to avoid dissension in Britain, he ordered that the matter be resolved at a synod convoked by Berhtwald &#145;with Bishop Wilfrid&#146;, and attended by Bosa of York and John of Hexham.<h2>
<a name="Settlementlastyearsanddeath"></a>Settlement, last years, and death</h2>Wilfrid, as always tempted to linger abroad, remained in Rome for several months, visiting the shrines of saints and collecting relics, ecclesiastical vestments, and ornaments. As he returned he suffered a seizure at Meaux, from which he perhaps never fully recovered and during which he received a vision indicating that he had been saved by the intercession of the Virgin, whose cult he had hitherto neglected in favour of the apostles Peter and Andrew. He arrived in Kent in 705, was reconciled with Berhtwald, and, attended by his abbots, made his way to London and thence to the former king, &AElig;thelred, by then abbot of Bardney, who greeted him with renewed friendship. Aldfrith, who refused to accept the judgment of the Holy See, died shortly afterwards, leaving a minor as his heir and apparently expressing regret for his obduracy. Wilfrid was much involved in the political upheaval which followed. Aldfrith's successor, Eadwulf, was of a different lineage, and evidently was regarded by Wilfrid (whose entourage at Ripon included Eadwulf's son) as a friend. Eadwulf, however, rejected Wilfrid's advances, ordering him to leave the kingdom. Shortly afterwards the king himself was expelled, after a reign lasting only two months, and Aldfrith's young son, Osred, succeeded. By then, in a sudden <i>renversement</i>, Osred had become Wilfrid's adopted son (<i>filius adoptivus</i>); the bishop, so long at variance with the house of Ecgfrith, had been transformed into the guardian of its heir. It is perhaps at this period that Hexham, under Wilfrid's episcopal control, espoused the cult of the saint&#150;king Oswald, a leading member of Osred's lineage. The fruits of the realignment became apparent in 706 when, at a synod presided over by Archbishop Berhtwald and attended by Northumbria's leading nobles and clergy, Ripon and Hexham with all their possessions were restored to Wilfrid. Shortly afterwards Bosa of York died, and the opportunity arose to reinstate Wilfrid in his original see. The ageing and probably ailing bishop did not, however, press his claims, acquiescing instead in the translation of John of Hexham, a move which left Wilfrid with episcopal as well as abbatial authority at Hexham. Significantly, Stephen of Ripon never discusses the episode, which he perhaps regarded as a defeat.<br>
<br>Wilfrid survived a further four years. Some eighteen months before he died he suffered a second stroke, after which he made a final disposition of his possessions, choosing suitable superiors to rule his monasteries and, it seems, deciding on the distribution of his lands. Not long afterwards he shared out his portable treasure, kept at Ripon. His mode of doing so casts an interesting light on the ideals and practice of Rome's great champion. According to Stephen of Ripon, he summoned two of his abbots and a number of monks, before whom he divided his treasure into four parts. The best portion was offered to two Roman churches, the Liberian basilica, Santa Maria Maggiore, and the shrine&#150;church of the apostle Paul, San Paolo fuori le Mura; of the three remaining portions, one was to be devoted to the poor, a second to the abbots of Ripon and Hexham &#145;to purchase the friendship of kings and bishops&#146;  (Eddius Stephanus, <span class="italic">Life of Bishop Wilfrid</span>, c.63), and a third to rewarding those followers who had accompanied the bishop into exile but had not yet received treasure or estates. Although the exact sequence of events is unclear, it seems that Wilfrid went on to nominate his kinsman Tatberht as co-ruler and eventual successor at Ripon and Acca as his successor at Hexham. All this, it need hardly be said, is a world away from ideal Benedictine practice as recommended by the rule, which laid especial emphasis on the community's role in electing its superior regardless of the claims of the founder's kin. Indeed, Wilfrid's actions at this particularly crucial moment of his life look like those of a contemporary secular aristocrat. In particular, his sharing out of his treasure evokes the actions of a Germanic lord in the midst of his <i>comitatus</i> (following), rather than the traditional death-bed scenes of a Christian bishop and abbot. Significantly, none of this appears in Bede, whose own ideals of episcopal behaviour as set forth, for example, in his letter to Ecgberht or his life of Cuthbert are markedly different and more austere.<br>
<br>After making these dispositions, Wilfrid received a deputation asking him to confer with King Ceolred about the position of his monasteries in Mercia. He therefore left for that kingdom, where he again confirmed his will, distributing land and possessions among his monks. He then proceeded to his monastery at Oundle, where he was seized with a final sickness and shortly afterwards died. It was the forty-sixth year of his episcopate and the fourth year of Osred's reign: almost certainly, therefore, 709 or 710. After due preparation his body was placed in a cart and brought to Ripon for burial on the south side of the altar in the church of St Peter. Bede records the elaborate epitaph inscribed on his tomb.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentandcult"></a>Assessment and cult</h2>Undoubtedly ambitious, probably pugnacious and opinionated, Wilfrid was from an early age deeply and enthusiastically involved in controversy. His career divided contemporaries and has engendered debate among historians ever since the early eighth century, when Stephen of Ripon and Bede produced their divergent accounts. That Wilfrid could elicit fierce loyalty is sufficiently indicated by the admiring and committed tone of Stephen's biography. That, on the other hand, his was a somewhat ambiguous career, is suggested by Bede's account with its significant omissions and discreet distortions. Clearly Bede could not ignore a figure who played so large a part in establishing the church in his own kingdom and elsewhere, who had championed Roman orthodoxy so successfully, and who was, moreover, the patron of his friend and diocesan Acca. His account represents a carefully edited summary of those episodes in Stephen which were most relevant to his own purposes in writing his <span class="italic">History</span>. It need not necessarily be read as disapproving, although it is perhaps worth remembering that it was before Wilfrid, who for some six years was his diocesan, that Bede was accused of heresy, a charge which stimulated a furious letter stigmatizing the bishop's entourage as drunken boors, and barely veiling an attack on the bishop himself.<br>
<br>One aspect of Wilfrid's career which Bede unquestionably plays down is his involvement in earthly concerns. Undoubtedly, Wilfrid could in many ways be described as worldly; he was fond of display and a great builder and collector of fine objects; he clearly shared many of the values of the secular nobility, whose sons were to be found in his entourage, and treated his friends and followers with an open-handed generosity appropriate to a great lord; he was at home in royal courts and spent time and effort in winning the good opinions of kings and princes. Yet he was more than this. His support of &AElig;thelthryth in her pursuit of virginity suggests a concern for ascetic values sufficient to put at risk his most significant royal friendship. The controversies in which he was embroiled were clearly not all of his making; and his apparent willingness in 680 to accept the division of his diocese, provided his colleagues were drawn from his own clergy, seems reasonable. Above all, his evangelizing activities at the low points in his career suggest a genuine and continuing concern to fulfil his early vow before St Andrew's altar.<br>
<br>Wilfrid was one of the most cosmopolitan figures of his age: his monastic communities represent a network transcending English political boundaries; his diplomatic contacts extended from Ireland to Austrasian Francia, Lombard Italy, and Rome; his architectural, liturgical, and collecting interests mark him as among the foremost English patrons of the arts in the later seventh century, rivalled only by Benedict Biscop. Such wide-ranging activities left a lasting impact, especially apparent in his missionary work. Not only did he do much to speed up the final phases of the conversion of the English kingdoms in the 680s, but in Frisia his preaching, followed up by the work of his pupil Willibrord, and his consecration of Willibrord's companion Swithberht as bishop in the early 690s, initiated Anglo-Saxon intervention in the pagan areas on the Frankish periphery.<br>
<br>All in all, Wilfrid was a remarkably complex figure. The defender of Roman orthodoxy was educated in an Irish-influenced milieu and built up a monastic confederation not unlike those of his Irish contemporaries. The earliest Northumbrian exponent of the Benedictine rule probably himself followed eclectic Gallic observance. Paradox and ambiguity also characterized his personal life. Clearly ambitious, he declined several offers of advancement, including, apparently, the English primacy. Worldly and rich, he seems to have practised private austerities. Such contradictions help to explain the ambivalent discretion of Bede's portrait.<br>
<br>Among his followers Wilfrid became the object of a cult immediately after his death. At Oundle, in ceremonies which resemble those accorded to other early English saints, the body was brought into a marquee and laid out, washed, and clothed in appropriate ecclesiastical vestments. Water used in washing the body was ritually poured away at a carefully marked site which became the scene of miracles, and the robe on which Wilfrid's body had been laid out was also preserved and esteemed a holy relic capable of working wonders. At Ripon the whole community came out bearing relics to greet the funeral cort&egrave;ge in a ceremony again modelled on those for the reception of a saint. Tatberht, Wilfrid's heir, established the formal apparatus of a cult, celebrating a daily private mass in Wilfrid's honour and keeping Thursday, the day on which he died, as a feast day equivalent to Sunday. The anniversary of the saint's death became an even more solemn feast attended by a great gathering of his abbots and followers. There were vigils at the tomb and on at least one occasion the event was marked by a sign which was taken by Stephen of Ripon as proof that in death Wilfrid had joined the company of the apostles in heaven.<br>
<br>In pre-conquest England, Wilfrid was commemorated by two feasts, 12 October and 24 April. In 709 neither date was a Thursday, the death-day which Stephen of Ripon expressly says was kept as Wilfrid's feast. Although the October date has traditionally been regarded as the main commemoration, marking Wilfrid's death or deposition, the April feast is in fact earlier&#151;it alone occurs in the eighth- and ninth-century calendars; 24 April was a Thursday in 710, and is therefore probably the date of Wilfrid's death. The emphasis on the October feast perhaps developed because that in April was likely to conflict with Lent and Easter.<br>
<br>Although Wilfrid's cult started early, it did not spread particularly rapidly. Stephen of Ripon's life survives in only two manuscripts and probably never had a wide currency outside Wilfrid's foundations. One reason for its limited circulation is that the Wilfridian confederation soon broke up; almost certainly, it suffered a severe blow when Wilfrid's heir at Hexham was driven from his see in 731. Thereafter, the main cult centre seems to have been at Ripon, where, following its sack by Eadred in the mid-tenth century, the cult was revived and patronized by Oda, archbishop of Canterbury, and his nephew Oswald, archbishop of York. There were, allegedly, two <i>inventiones</i> (discoveries), the accounts of which are mutually contradictory. Oda was believed to have brought Wilfrid's body from Ripon to Canterbury, whereas Oswald elevated the relics <i>in situ</i> and re-established a community at Ripon to look after them. Those events issued in a verse reworking of Stephen's life, by Frithegod, a member of Oda's household, again a work which achieved only a very limited circulation. Thereafter relics were distributed to other great centres, including Peterborough.<br>
<br>By the conquest Wilfrid's cult was relatively well-established; his feast is to be found in most of the early calendars, although curiously he was rarely invoked in the litanies. In England at least eleven religious communities claimed to possess a relic, and some forty-eight ancient churches were dedicated to him.<br>
