<span class="headword">Theyer,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> 1673), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized at Brockworth, Gloucestershire, on 5 November 1598, the son of John Theyer (<i>d</i>. 1631) and his wife, Jane, and grandson of Thomas Theyer of Brockworth. He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1613, but did not graduate. After three years there he practised common law at New Inn, London, where the mother of Anthony Wood, the future antiquary, proposed to send her son to qualify under him as an attorney. Although Wood did not go, he became a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>In 1628, at Theyer's marriage to his wife, Susan, he was given by his father a small estate at Cooper's Hill, Brockworth. From his grandmother's brother, Richard Hart, last prior of Llanthony Secunda, Gloucestershire, Theyer had inherited a valuable library of manuscripts. The Theyers, who had a son, John, made Cooper's Hill their home, and were visited by Wood, who made use of the library.<br>
<br>In 1643 Theyer was in Oxford, serving in the king's army, and presented to Charles in Merton College garden a copy of his <span class="italic">Aerio mastix, or, A vindication of the apostolicall and generally received government of the church of Christ by bishops</span> (1643). On 6 July that year he was created MA by the king's command, on account of his literary and ecclesiastical achievement. According to Wood he became a Roman Catholic about this time, and began, but did not finish, &#145;A friendly debate between protestants and papists&#146;. His estate was sequestered by parliament, and he was pronounced one of the most &#145;inveterate&#146; delinquents with whom they had to deal. His family was almost destitute until his discharge was obtained on 4 November 1652.<br>
<br>Theyer died at Cooper's Hill on 25 August 1673, and was buried in Brockworth churchyard on 28 August. The collection of 800 manuscripts on which his reputation was almost exclusively founded went to his grandson Charles Theyer (<i>b</i>. 1651), who had matriculated from University College, Oxford, in 1668 and who was probably the lecturer of Totteridge, Hertfordshire, who published <span class="italic">A Sermon on her Majesty's Happy Anniversary</span> (1707). After the collection had passed to the London bookseller Robert Scott, a partial catalogue was prepared by William Beveridge, later bishop of St Asaph, and William Jane in 1678  (BL, Royal MSS appendix, 70); 312 were bought by Charles II, the last large collection to enter the royal manuscripts.<br>
