<span class="headword">Copland,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was believed by Dibdin  (Ames, Dibdin, and Herbert, 3.127) to have been the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6265/', "Robert Copland (fl. 1505&#150;1547)")</script>; he is more likely to have been Robert's son. After Robert's death, probably in 1547, William continued as printer in the same house. On 24 November 1546 he had received a licence to marry Joanne Tyddeswell of St Bride's. Though he may have begun printing as early as 1545 his earliest dated book, <span class="italic">A Fruteful and a Very Christen Instruction for Children</span>, printed for Richard Kele, appeared in 1547. An original member of the Stationers' Company, Copland was named in the charter of 1557. On 12 March of the same year he was brought before the privy council and ordered to deliver to the printer J. Cawood for burning all the copies which he had printed of Cranmer's <span class="italic">Recantation</span>. The Stationers' register, which covers only the second decade of his career, records that he was fined four times&#151;Herbert calls his behaviour &#145;as regular as most of his associates&#146;  (Ames, Dibdin, and Herbert, 1.128)&#151;and that he took an apprentice, Robert Jonnes, in May or June 1562. Copland's career falls into three periods: he first printed at Robert Copland's old shop, the Rose Garland in Fleet Street, from 1547 to early 1558; he then printed at the Three Crane Wharf in the Vintry, in the parish of St Martin, from some time before October 1558 to possibly 1562; and he was in Lothbury, opposite St Margaret's Church, from about 1563 to 1567.<br>
<br>During his twenty-year career Copland produced over 150 books, many of them for other printers. His work includes a remarkable number of popular items, romances in particular, which had been first published by Wynkyn de Worde and even by Caxton. Among them are <span class="italic">The Four Sons of Aymon</span>, which Caxton had translated and published in 1490, de Worde about 1505, Notary about 1510, and William Copland (three editions for other printers) in 1554; <span class="italic">Sir Bevis of Hampton</span>, first printed by de Worde in 1500 and then five more times before William Copland printed two editions in the 1560s; <span class="italic">Valentine and Orson</span> (de Worde <i>c</i>.1510; William Copland <i>c</i>.1555 and <i>c</i>.1565); and <span class="italic">The Seven Wise Masters of Rome</span> (Pynson 1493; de Worde 1506?; William Copland <i>c</i>.1555). The list of popular books owned by the sixteenth-century Coventry collector Captain Cox includes many of Copland's titles and it is likely that Cox possessed Copland's actual editions. What may have been Copland's last project, <span class="italic">A Dyaloge betweene ij Beggers</span>, was registered to him between 22 July 1567 and 22 July 1568, but no copy survives.<br>
<br>Because of his connection with Robert Copland, and Robert's with Caxton's heir, Wynkyn de Worde, William Copland represents the fourth in a direct line of succession from England's first printer. He provided a connection between popular reading taste of the late fifteenth century and that of the seventeenth, continuing to make available works such as Caxton's translation of Le Fevre's <span class="italic">Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</span> (1475?) which first appeared at Bruges and which saw seven more editions, including Copland's, before 1636. The date of his death is not known, but he was buried on 30 May 1569 in the parish of St Margaret, Lothbury, London. Shortly afterwards the wardens of the Stationers' Company &#145;Payd for the buryall of coplande vj<sup>s</sup>&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.392). Whether this payment indicates impoverishment or merely recognition of an original member has been disputed; the former may be more likely since only one other contemporary burial payment is printed by the register's editor.<br>
