<span class="headword">Bacon,  John</span>  (1740&#150;1799), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 24 November 1740 in Southwark, London, the son of Thomas Bacon, a clothworker. He was descended from an old family living in Wincanton in Somerset. In 1755 he was apprenticed to Nicholas Crispe, the owner of a porcelain factory in Vauxhall, with workshops in Bow churchyard and Lambeth. Crispe encouraged the young Bacon to exhibit with the Society of Arts. In 1759 Bacon's figure of <span class="italic">Peace</span> won him a premium, and over the next twenty years he was awarded eleven more premiums from the society, including their gold medal. Bacon worked for Crispe until 1764, when he began designing for the ceramic and metalwork industry. Among his clients were Daniel Pincot of Paternoster Row, Spitalfields; Josiah Wedgwood; William Duesbury of the Chelsea-Derby Porcelain Works; Sir William Chambers; Benjamin Vulliamy, the royal clockmaker, of Pall Mall; Matthew Boulton of Birmingham; James Tassie; and Neal &amp; Co., of Hanley. Indeed, Bacon is considered to be the most important designer for British industry before John Flaxman. Bacon entered the Royal Academy Schools on 24 June 1769 and received the academy's first ever gold medal in sculpture for his relief <span class="italic">Aeneas Carrying his Father from Burning Troy</span> (1769). In 1770 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1771 he moved from Wardour Street to 17 Newman Street, Marylebone, where he established a large sculpture workshop that employed as many as twenty assistants, notably Henry Webber and Charles Peart. In that same year Bacon became chief designer and manager of the Coade Artificial Stone Company, a position he held until his death. In 1773 he married Elizabeth Wade, who died in February 1783 leaving him with five children&#151;two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1010/', "Thomas Bacon (b. 1773)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/996/', "Bacon, John")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/996/', "John Bacon the younger (1777&#150;1859)")</script> and three daughters. In the autumn of 1783 he married Martha Holland, with whom he had three more sons.<br>
<br>The turning point in Bacon's career as a sculptor came with the exhibition of his life-size terracotta figure of <span class="italic">Mars</span> for the Society of Arts. The statue caught the attention of the archbishop of York, who commissioned a bust of George III. The sittings with the king proved to be highly advantageous to the sculptor. In 1778 Bacon was elected Royal Academician. His diploma piece, <span class="italic">Sickness</span>, served as the model for the sick man on the monument to Thomas Guy he sculpted for the chapel at Guy's Hospital. The memorial group to Guy has been praised as the finest British monument of its time. In 1778, when the competition was announced for the national monument to William Pitt the elder, earl of Chatham, the astute Bacon chose to show his model to the king, usurping the normal competition procedures of the Royal Academy. The sense of favouritism shown to Bacon with the awarding of the Chatham commission was the first of a series of such accusations and jealousies brought upon the sculptor. The memorial group to Chatham, some 30 feet high, established the scale for all future monuments in Westminster Abbey and brought praise from the king and Sir Joshua Reynolds, president of the Royal Academy. In 1784 Bacon won the competition held by the academy for a statue of Admiral Rodney for Spanish Town, Jamaica. The prestige of the Rodney figure, with its elegant relief panels, led to fifteen more commissions for funerary monuments for the island. In 1788 Bacon was selected to execute the marble statue of Dr Johnson, as well as that of John Howard, for St Paul's Cathedral, London. During the same period he was commissioned to execute the colossal figures of <span class="italic">Fame</span> and the <span class="italic">Genius of England</span>, together with <span class="italic">George III and the River Thames</span>, for Somerset House. His success at working in bronze caused him to be recognized as &#145;exceptional amongst British sculptors of the time&#146;  (Bryant, 25). In 1793 the court of directors of the East India Company commissioned Bacon to sculpt a series of works. The first of these was a marble portrait statue of Governor-General Cornwallis for their general court room, and the second the pediment decorations for East India House on Leadenhall Street.<br>
<br>In addition to the public and corporate commissions, the Bacon studio produced an array of funerary monuments, chimney-pieces, garden sculpture, and portrait busts. While his figures have neo-classical drapery, the elaborateness of their surfaces, like the illusionistic effects employed on some of the monuments, indicates his appreciation of the work of earlier sculptors such as Roubiliac. The productivity of the workshop was based first on Bacon's perfecting the use of a pointing machine that enabled his assistants to translate his models into full-scale works of sculpture. Second, he used a pattern book for clients to select a specific design for a monument. While these practices brought an extraordinary amount of work and prosperity to the studio, Bacon's entire career came under the critical eye of the fine-art establishment. In addition to the undue favouritism he received, his fellow artists, knowing that the sculptor had never studied in Italy, cited his natural inclination towards sentimentality as being out of date with the new neo-classical aesthetic. Despite these criticisms, which were often harsh, his work was much admired by his clients, who were powerful and influential both within Britain and abroad. Bacon was a staunch supporter of the British monarchy, an ardent Methodist, and a founding member of the Eclectic Society, later the Church Missionary Society.<br>
<br>Bacon died from an inflammation of the bowels at his home at 17 Newman Street on 7 August 1799 and was buried under the north gallery in Whitfield's Chapel, Tottenham Court Road. He left a substantial fortune, as well as many unfinished commissions, to his children. John Bacon the younger inherited his father's studio and remaining commissions, and Thomas, who had exhibited with the Royal Academy, assisted his brother for a brief time.<br>
