<span class="headword">Firebrace, Sir  Henry</span>  (1619/20&#150;1691), <span class="occ">court official</span>, was the sixth son of Robert Firebrace of Derby, successively clerk in the households of Sir Robert Bradbourne and the Roper family of Heanor, Derbyshire, and Susan, daughter of Thomas Jerome, yeoman, of Kegworth, Leicestershire. He was a foundation scholar of Repton School, which he left in 1633. Shortly afterwards his father took the family to London and he was apprenticed in turn to the scriveners Richard Green of All Hallows Barking by the Tower and Richard Rochdale, to whom he was still bound in January 1643. Through her marriage his sister Rebecca had become related to Basil Feilding, second earl of Denbigh and in June 1643 Firebrace was appointed secretary to Denbigh's parliamentarian council of war.<br>
<br>Firebrace's later narrative of his career records that he had been &#145;of service&#146; to Charles I at Uxbridge, presumably at the negotiations which opened there in January 1645. In June 1645 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Daniel Dowell, yeoman, of Stoke Golding, Leicestershire, a young woman employed in Denbigh's service. During 1646 the couple seem to have remained with the earl's household at Queen Street, Covent Garden. In March he petitioned parliament for &pound;325 in arrears and expenses for the period up to Denbigh's resignation in April 1645. He was in attendance on Denbigh when the earl arrived in Newcastle on 23 January 1647 as one of the parliamentarian commissioners to receive the person of the king. By his own account the king ordered him &#145;to &hellip; make my application to some of the commissioners that I might be admitted to attend his majesty as one of the pages of his bedchamber, in which I prevailed&#146;, almost certainly due to Denbigh's influence. He was able to use the trust in which he was held to appear to combine household duties with those of a guard, while his real role was as a smuggler of correspondence for the king and in the organization of escape plans.<br>
<br>Firebrace was continuously in attendance on the king during 1647. On 11 November he removed himself from guarding the back stairs while Charles escaped on horseback from his quarters at Hampton Court. With the king again under guard on the Isle of Wight he travelled to London to arrange the transit of messages and, reunited with Charles, was able to deliver &#145;several dispatches, every week, and conveyed his safely away&#146;  (Firebrace, 255). Over the following months several escape attempts were made. On 20 March 1648 the king intended to depart through the window in his bedchamber which contained a central bar; Firebrace feared it would make the opening too narrow. He was proved right for the king stuck fast, unable to press his chest through the gap, or even to withdraw from it. The attempt led to a tightening of security. Ordered to leave Carisbrooke, Firebrace continued to work for the king's escape, and secured nitric acid to dislodge the window bar for an attempt launched on 28 May. Sentries were bribed and plans made for a ship to Holland but at the last moment the plan collapsed. He continued to organize communication between king and supporters and on 21 August his name appeared on the king's list of proposed attendants at Newport and, remarkably, was accepted by parliament. On 29 November, following Charles's rejection of the army proposals and the replacement of Colonel Hammond as commander on the island, he urged the king to take a boat and &#145;commit yourself to the mercy of the seas, where God will preserve you: and trust not yourself in the hands of those merciless villains who I fear this night will murder you&#146;. Charles rejected his advice.<br>
<br>Firebrace was not able to accompany the king to Windsor, though he may have been involved in a last attempt to rescue him from St James's Palace in January 1649. A diamond ring, containing a portrait of the king, which passed into the possession of the earls of Denbigh was, according to tradition, given to Firebrace by Charles as he mounted the scaffold. After the execution he returned to the service of Denbigh, who had accepted appointment to the new council of state. When Denbigh retired to Warwickshire in 1651 he accompanied him, acting as secretary and residing at nearby Stoke Golding.<br>
<br>In May 1660 Firebrace journeyed to London to seek preferment. According to Charles I, whose wishes were conveyed to his son via Bishop Juxon, he was &#145;a person very faithful and serviceable to him in his greatest extremities&#146; and deserving of favour  (Firebrace, 205). He was admitted to the royal household as third clerk of the kitchen in the board of green cloth on 20 July, promoted second clerk in January 1661 (in which capacity he attended the coronation) and chief clerk in early 1667. In 1664 he married Alice (<i>d</i>. in or before 1675), daughter of Richard Bagnall, a gentleman usher at court; they moved several times in London, maintaining a permanent residence only at Stoke Golding. In 1677 he was granted a patent of arms and was made assistant warden on the office of green cloth by warrant dated 23 August 1680.<br>
<br>In 1685 Firebrace married his third wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of Richard Sergeant of the royal wine cellar. Of his four known sons, all from his first marriage, Henry became dean of Trinity College, Cambridge. Basil, vintner and purveyor of wines to the royal household, was sheriff of London in 1687 and MP for Chippenham in 1690, and was created a baronet in 1698; he went bankrupt in 1707, suffered imprisonment for stabbing a creditor, and died in 1724 unable to recover his fortunes. His father had been appointed clerk controller-in-ordinary of the board of green cloth on 14 March 1685 and chief controller on 12 July; he was knighted before 2 April 1685. He retired, aged sixty-nine, shortly after the accession of William III and died on 27 January 1691. He was buried on 3 February in the chancel of St Margaret's, Stoke Golding, where a marble monument was erected to his memory.<br>
