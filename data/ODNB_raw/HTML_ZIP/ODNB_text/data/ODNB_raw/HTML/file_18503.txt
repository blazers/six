<span class="headword">Medows, Sir  William</span>  (1738&#150;1813), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 31 December 1738, the third son of Philip Medows (1708&#150;1781), deputy ranger of Richmond Park, and his wife, Lady Frances Pierrepont, the daughter of the duke of Kingston. As a youth he is thought to have attended Eton College (1755&#150;6) before entering the army as an ensign in the 50th foot on 26 February 1757; he was promoted lieutenant on 20 November 1757 and campaigned with his regiment in Germany between 1760 and 1762. Commissioned a captain in the 4th horse on 6 March 1764, he was promoted major in 1766, and appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 5th foot on 31 December 1769. When stationed with his regiment in Ireland he married, in 1770, Frances Augusta (1747/8&#150;1827), the daughter of Robert Hammerton, of Hammerton, co. Tipperary. Medows then completed two years as lieutenant-colonel of the 12th light dragoons before exchanging into the 55th foot on 20 September 1775. He took his regiment to America the same year and was given command of a composite battalion of grenadiers during the New York campaign of 1776. In September 1777 he was wounded while leading his grenadiers at the battle of Brandywine. He then returned to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 5th foot (16 October 1777).<br>
<br>In November 1778 Medows accompanied, as a brigadier-general, the expedition led by General James Grant which sailed from New York to the West Indies. During the landings on the French-held island of St Lucia he commanded the reserve, some 1300 men, which consisted of his own regiment, the 5th, and the expedition's combined grenadier and light infantry companies. St Lucia had no sooner been captured, however, when a vastly superior French armament under the command of the marquis d'Estaing appeared, and Medows's position on the Vigie peninsula&#151;the key to the British defences&#151;was assaulted by 5000 troops. Notwithstanding the odds, the battle-hardened British veterans beat off the enemy attacks and inflicted 1600 casualties, and in so doing established Medows's reputation.<br>
<br>Medows returned to England in 1780 and was made colonel of the 89th foot. In March 1781 he commanded the troops which sailed for the Cape of Good Hope with Commodore George Johnstone's squadron. The French, however, beat the British to the Cape, reinforced the Dutch garrison, and rendered a landing by Medows's troops impracticable. Dismissing Johnstone's suggestion that their expedition divert to the River Plate, Medows interpreted his instructions positively and continued on to India, where his reinforcement, which arrived in February 1782, proved crucial in the struggle against Haider Ali of Mysore and the French. Medows himself, although carrying the rank of major-general, played only a minor part in the unfolding conflict. Dismayed by the antagonism between the civil and military authorities at Madras, he refused the overall command which a disgruntled Eyre Coote attempted to thrust upon him and elected instead to serve as a volunteer aboard Admiral Hughes's fleet.<br>
<br>In 1788 Henry Dundas sent Medows back to India as governor and commander-in-chief of Bombay. The governor-general of Bengal, Lord Cornwallis, was given to understand that Medows would ultimately be his successor. After two years in post at Bombay, during which time Cornwallis first came to doubt his intended replacement's judgement and application to business, Medows succeeded to the governorship of Madras and immediately took command of the forces assembling to fight the Third Anglo-Mysore War against Tipu Sultan. Throughout the ensuing campaign, however, Medows proved incapable of getting to grips with his elusive foe. Not only were his movements, burdened by a long supply train, too slow, but by splitting his army into detachments he risked defeat in detail. In the end all Medows had to show for his efforts was the capture of Coimbatore: he had not penetrated the Mysore heartlands, and Tipu Sultan had been left free to ravage the Carnatic. Medows admitted to Cornwallis that he felt unequal to his responsibilities, and the governor-general, having by now lost patience, sailed from Bengal in December 1790 to take personal charge. Thereafter, as second in command, Medows was happier. Leading the stormings of Bangalore and Nandidroog was more to his taste than accepting the reversion of the governor-generalship, which, when formally offered him, he declined. Medows relished also the prospect of leading the right-hand of three assault columns against Tipu Sultan's capital of Seringapatam. But faulty staff work led his column to turn in the wrong direction during the night attack of 6&#150;7 February 1792; Medows succeeded in reuniting with Cornwallis's centre column only after the decisive combat had already been won. While he was not exclusively to blame, Medows allowed the error to disturb his mind; and when Tipu Sultan's decision to sue for peace denied him the opportunity to atone in battle for his mistake he shot himself. Fortunately the suicide attempt was bungled and Medows speedily recovered.<br>
<br>Medows was kindly received on his return to England; he was made a KB on 14 December 1792 and was offered command of an expedition (which never sailed) to capture Mauritius and the Isle de Bourbon. George III considered him &#145;eccentrick though worthy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 2.74). Medows was promoted lieutenant-general on 12 October 1793, was made colonel of the 7th dragoon guards on 2 November 1796, and became a full general in 1798; the same year he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Wight. Between June 1801 and May 1803 he served as commander of the forces in Ireland. He settled afterwards at Conholt Park, near Andover, Wiltshire. His last appointment was as governor of Hull in 1808, a post which he held until his death, at Bath on 14 November 1813.<br>
<br>Medows lacked the self-belief necessary to high command but he was a notable fighting general. In moments of danger he always had well-chosen words of encouragement to offer his men and they admired him wholeheartedly. It was entirely characteristic that he should have resigned to the troops his share of the Seringapatam prize money, worth nearly &pound;5000.<br>
