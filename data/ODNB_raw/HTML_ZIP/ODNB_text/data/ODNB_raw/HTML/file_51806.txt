<span class="headword">Cox, Sir  Anthony Wakefield <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1915&#150;1993), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 18 July 1915 in Park Road, Peterborough, the elder of the two sons of William Edward Cox (1880&#150;1960), civil servant, and from 1936 senior principal inspector of taxes at the Inland Revenue, and his wife, Elsie Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wakefield (1882&#150;1977). His younger brother, <a href="#cosubject_102635">Oliver [<i>see below</i>]</a>, also became an architect. Tony Cox was educated at Mill Hill School, north-west London, where he gained a reputation as an athlete and a poet. He entered the Architectural Association School in 1933, meeting a year group of former public school boys (and a few girls) who became close friends and, in several cases, his lifetime professional partners. In this talented group, Cox stood out for his clarity of thought and expression combined with left-wing political motivation. These attributes were tempered by a self-deprecating wit and a talent for writing light verses, impromptu clerihews, letters, and song lyrics for the school's celebrated pantomimes. Like students in several previous years, he made the thrilling discovery of Le Corbusier's words and architectural images, creating possibilities that few of the school's staff were then willing to consider.<br>
<br>While Cox was a student the Architectural Association School went through unsettling transformations, beginning in 1935 with the appointment of E. A. A. Rouse as director. A follower of the town planner Patrick Geddes, Rouse encouraged students to see design in terms of &#145;action sequences&#146;&#151;habitual daily actions from which the dimensions of spaces could be determined&#151;and promoted modern architecture not just as a technical and stylistic innovation but as a potential source of social change to be grounded in research. Rouse's &#145;unit system&#146;, predicating a new &#145;real life&#146; approach to training, suited Cox, whose special ability was as a thinker and organizer. Thus, when the Architectural Association's council appointed a conservative director of education, H. S. Goodhart-Rendel, to apply the brakes, Cox and his colleagues engaged in an ultimately successful battle to retain group working. In 1938 Cox became joint editor of a new and influential student-led magazine, <span class="italic">Focus</span> (1938&#150;9), in which&#151;in the paper's first issue&#151;he published an open letter to Goodhart-Rendel in a special section printed on yellow paper. Cox's best-known and subsequently much quoted <span class="italic">Focus</span> article, &#145;Highpoint Two, North Hill, Highgate&#146;, appeared in the magazine's second issue. This offered a sharp attack on Berthold Lubetkin's recently completed second Highpoint housing block (1938), which Cox criticized for its overly decorative entrance hall, accusing the architect of &#145;crimes&#146; of formalism that went beyond &#145;legitimate limits&#146; and risked setting &#145;certain formal values above use-values&#146;  (pp. 76&#150;9). At the time Cox was also making his mark as a writer and reviewer beyond the Architectural Association and, as a result, eminent figures such as Walter Gropius and Ben Nicholson were keen to receive news of his activities.<br>
<br>In June 1939, &#145;with no jobs of our own, no capital and almost no experience&#146;, eleven graduates of the school, Cox among them, formed Architects' Co-operative Partnership (ACP). The group's intention was to pursue the collaborative working practices they had acquired as students, though its members were immediately scattered by the war. Cox worked initially as an architect for ordnance factories and hostels under Sir Alexander Gibb and William Holford, and from 1943 to 1946 he served in the Royal Engineers in western Europe&#151;helping to restore water supplies to Brussels in 1944&#150;and then in India. On 16 January 1943 at Edmonton register office, Middlesex, he married a former Architectural Association student, Susan Babington Smith (1917&#150;2003), the ninth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36144/', "Sir Henry Babington Smith")</script>, civil servant, and Lady Elisabeth Mary Bruce. The couple had two daughters, Joanna (<i>b</i>. 1948) and Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1952).<br>
<br>From 1946 ACP gradually reformed with seven of its original members, including Cox and his fellow <span class="italic">Focus</span> editor Leo de Syllas. After demobilization Cox worked briefly with Charles Aslin and Sir Stirrat Johnson-Marshall as part of the famous Hertfordshire county council schools division. In 1946 ACP received an important commission to design a rubber manufacturing plant at Byrn-mawr, near Ebbw Vale, for a subsidiary of Enfield Cables Ltd, whose director James Grimston personally oversaw the invitation. The resulting Bryn-mawr Rubber Factory (1946&#150;51, dem. 2001) proved a baptism of fire for ACP but was also a triumph of design, attracting international coverage and becoming the partnership's best-known building, listed grade 2* in 1986. Constructed in association with the engineer Ove Arup, the factory took the form of nine thin concrete domes enclosing a massive working space. Cox was responsible for some of the final design at Bryn-mawr, including the curved concrete roof of the entrance hall. However, a principle of strict anonymity was applied to all of the partners' work, and the office&#151;based from 1947 in Gordon Square, London&#151;sought as far as possible to operate a system of open meetings at which anyone could suggest improvements to a scheme at the design stage. In 1953 ACP moved to Charlotte Street, London, and revised its name to Architects' Co-Partnership&#151;an attempt at mild depoliticization in the face of anxieties from their public sector clients.<br>
<br>Cox remained with ACP for the rest of his career, his qualities of sympathy and leadership serving to hold together the group's disparate talents. These were combined with displays of donnish eccentricity, such as keeping a bookmark in selected volumes at Foyles bookshop, Charing Cross, and reading a chapter every lunch hour. But despite his academic ability Cox resisted the intellectualization of architecture that appealed to a younger generation and he was known for his realism, analytical nature, and firm belief in the direct relationship between form and function. During the 1950s he worked on new primary and secondary schools, principally in the English midlands, and, in total, he was responsible for some sixty of ACP's commissions over a forty-year period. His larger personal projects&#151;which include the departments of chemistry at University College, London, and the University of Leicester (1957), the chemistry and biochemistry departments of Imperial College, London, the Greenwood Theatre at Guy's Hospital, London (1969), and the Maudsley Hospital's Institute of Psychiatry&#151;were well respected, though they deliberately lacked panache. In 1957 he designed a house for himself and his family on Bacons Lane, Highgate, north London, flanked by other architects' houses in a private cul-de-sac. From the outside an austere box, Cox's design proved spatially effective inside, where twin Isokon long chairs, a Ben Nicholson painting, and volumes by the Auden-generation poets evoked the 1930s.<br>
<br>With Philip Groves, an ACP partner of the second generation, Cox wrote <span class="italic">Design for Health Care</span> (1981), in which he drew on his experience of hospital design with the partnership; this was followed in 1990 by <span class="italic">Hospitals and Health Care Facilities</span>. In the early 1980s he was responsible for an unexecuted scheme for rationalizing the Foreign and Commonwealth Office buildings in Whitehall after their preservation by listing. Cox was the only ACP partner to take on major roles in the profession's affairs, including the presidency of the Architectural Association (1962&#150;3), where he also taught part-time, and membership of RIBA's council (1967&#150;72) and board of education (1967&#150;73). He also served on the royal fine art commission between 1970 and 1985, and he and Susan became involved in local conservation in Highgate. In 1972 he was appointed CBE and in 1983 he was knighted, in part for his role as the public face of the socially progressive and technically innovative partnership he had co-founded more than forty years earlier. Slightly built, friendly, and humorous, Cox produced highly original homemade Christmas cards that were eagerly awaited every year. He died from cancer on 5 January 1993 at his home, 5 Bacons Lane, Highgate. He was survived by his wife and daughters; his funeral was held on 16 January at St Michael's Church, Highgate, and he was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Cox's brother, <a name="cosubject_102635"></a><span class="headword">Oliver Jasper Cox</span>  (1920&#150;2010), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 20 April 1920 at 28 Gloucester Road, Teddington, London. He followed his brother to Mill Hill School and the Architectural Association School, where he shared a studio with Howard Cleminson, worked on a mass observation study of multi-occupied houses in Fulham, and contributed to his brother's magazine, <span class="italic">Focus</span>. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served with the Royal Engineers, including some time in India. Following demobilization he travelled with his friend Michael Ventris to Scandinavia, where they studied contemporary designs in architecture. After graduating he was recruited by David Medd (whom he had met during the war) at Hertfordshire county council's renowned architecture group, where he was principally involved in innovative uses of colour in the building of new primary schools. In 1950 he, together with A. W. Cleeve Barr and two others, left as a result of a dispute over pay and conditions, and all four joined the architects' department of London county council's housing division, working under H. J. Whitfield Lewis. His most important work of this period was at the Alton East estate at Roehampton, where he designed nine point-blocks with a view over Richmond Park, his design owing much to Scandinavian influences. He also designed Clarendon Crescent in Paddington, and in other works was particularly noted for his incorporation of murals and sculptures by up-and-coming artists, and his family-friendly designs, including play spaces and large communal areas. He was also leader of the unrealized project to create a new town at Hook, south-east of London. Meanwhile, on 14 November 1953 he married his colleague Jeanne Denise (Jean) Cooper (1923&#150;2007), daughter of Dennis Cooper, civil servant. They had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>In 1960 Cox moved to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government as deputy chief architect and leader of the research and development group. There he was involved in the reports <span class="italic">Homes for Today and Tomorrow</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">Space in the Home</span> (1963), which were important in improving standards in public housing. In 1965 he joined his friend Graeme Shankland, with whom he had worked on the master plan for Hook New Town, to form Shankland Cox, of which he remained a partner until 1985, the year of Shankland's death. He then remained in practice with his wife, Jean, until her death. As well as housing projects in Bracknell, Lambeth, and Hillingdon, he collaborated with Shankland and with Jean on plans in France (at Cergy-Pontoise, Cap d'Agde, and old Pontoise) and in the Caribbean, most notably at Waterfront and Trench Town, in Kingston, Jamaica. In Montego Bay he made imaginative use of a small budget by dividing the land into plots, and providing a right-angle of walls on each plot, also laying on water and electricity, leaving the occupants to construct their own dwellings. The area soon developed into a thriving community, with many houses outgrowing the original envisaged size. He wrote a number of reports and short books, including, with Jean, a study of the naval hospital at Port Royal, Jamaica (1996), and (jointly) two books on Lauderdale House, in Highgate. He was appointed CBE in 1982. He died of septic shock at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, on 24 April 2010, and was survived by his three children.<br>
