<span class="headword">Maguire,  Nicholas</span>  (1458/9&#150;1512), <span class="occ">bishop of Leighlin</span>, was born at Tulmogima, co. Carlow, and was the natural son of a priest. He &#145;studied in Oxford, although it was but 2 yrs and 3 months, yet he profitted so much in logik, philosophie, the seven liberall sciences and divinitie that in his latter days he seemed to excel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Ireland</span>, ed. Butler, 32). He was prebendary of Ullard, co. Carlow, from about 1487 and in consequence also a canon of the cathedral; and from about 1489 he was perpetual vicar of Kiltennel. At Ullard he is said to have &#145;preached and delivered great learninge&#146;  (ibid.). He was elected bishop of Leighlin by the dean and chapter some time before 21 April 1490, aged only thirty-one. Dowling's assertion that &#145;the King and nobilitie of Leinster&#146; took part in the election points to the dispute that attended his appointment. The election was initially nullified, the pope having reserved the see of Leighlin; but Maguire was later provided by the pope, in deference to local wishes. At the time of his elevation it was discovered he had not received all the dispensations from his illegitimacy necessary to hold his previous cures. He was, however, rehabilitated and allowed to hold them during such time as he was bishop.<br>
<br>According to Sir James Ware, &#145;he began many Works, but Death prevented him from putting the finishing Hand to any; except his Chronicle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works</span>, 3.91&#150;2). This chronicle, which can no longer be located, was stated by the Very Revd Richard Butler in 1849 to be copied in the <span class="roman">Book of Leighlin</span>. It was used by Thady Dowling, chancellor of Leighlin, in compiling his annals of Ireland. The latter writer says Maguire was commended &#145;for his hospitalitie and the number of cowes that he grased without losse (so well was he beloved) upon the woodes &amp; mountaines of Knockbrannen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Ireland</span>, ed. Butler, 32). Harris, in his edition of Ware, says that Maguire also wrote a life of Milo Roche, his predecessor as bishop of Leighlin. Maguire died at Leighlin in 1512 and was buried in the cathedral there. His life is said to have been written by Thomas Browne, his chaplain, &#145;about the Year 1513&#146;.<br>
