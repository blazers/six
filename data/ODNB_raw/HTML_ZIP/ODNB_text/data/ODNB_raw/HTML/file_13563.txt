<span class="headword">Hollins,  William</span>  (1763&#150;1843), <span class="occ">architect and sculptor</span>, was born at Shifnal, Shropshire, on 18 March 1763, the son of John and Mary Hollins. He married <i>c</i>.1783 Catherine (1764&#150;1831), daughter of Peter and Betty Holbrook of Middlewich, Cheshire, with whom he had sixteen children. They settled at 17 Great Hampton Street, Birmingham, which remained William's, and then his son Peter's, home and studio until 1886. Originally a journeyman stonemason, William Hollins taught himself drawing and perspective, learned the rudiments of classical architecture in the London office of George Saunders, and in 1792 assisted Saunders with the working drawings for the rebuilding of the Birmingham Theatre Royal.<br>
<br>Hollins had established his own practice in Birmingham by 1798, when he designed the old buildings of the Union Street Library. In 1808 he built the old Dispensary, also in Union Street; and in 1813 the Birmingham Proof House, Banbury Street. Other Birmingham buildings by Hollins survive only in prints: the earliest parts of the public offices and prison in Moor Street (1805), the Institute for Promoting the Fine Arts, and the Egyptian Conduit in the Bull Ring (1807). Though Hollins's architecture is predominantly Greek revival in style, he experimented with Gothic, notably in the restoration of Handsworth parish church (<i>c</i>.1819), and additions to the earl of Shrewsbury's Staffordshire residence, Alton Abbey, including ornamental stone carving; in 1817 he was working on a new Gothic entrance hall at Alton, and the installation of a steam heating system. Hollins's ideas of architectural style were associational ones. When building the Egyptian Conduit at Birmingham, he justified the placing of a pyramid at the side of the Gothic church of St Martin's by arguing that the pyramid was the Egyptian symbol of the deity.<br>
<br>As a sculptor, Hollins was outshone by his son Peter, though he exhibited at the Birmingham Society of Artists and the Royal Academy. Several of his buildings included carved figures, and he designed memorials for a number of churches in the Birmingham area. His studies of Roman lettering were used to formulate a set of rules for their construction: <span class="italic">The British Standard of Capital Letters Contained in the Roman Alphabet</span> (1813). In addition he prepared drawings for the new royal mint at St Petersburg, having declined, it is said, an invitation from the empress Catherine II to join her team of imperial architects. Hollins died at his home on 12 January 1843 and was buried in the churchyard at St Paul's, Birmingham. A memorial inside the church incorporates a portrait bust carved by his son Peter.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13563"></a><span class="headword">Peter Hollins</span>  (1800&#150;1886), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 1 May 1800 at 17 Great Hampton Street, Birmingham, the fourth surviving son of William Hollins, an elder Peter having died in infancy. He took drawing lessons at J. Vincent Barber's academy in Newhall Street, and trained in his father's studio until about 1822, when he went to work under Sir Francis Chantrey before returning to assist in his father's practice. While his father was employed at Alton Abbey, Peter carved much of the marble statuary and other ornamental work in the gardens, including a bust of Charles Talbot, fifteenth earl of Shrewsbury. About 1831 he established a London studio in Old Bond Street, before finally returning to Great Hampton Street following William's death in 1843. He restored the tower front of St Philip's Church (now the cathedral) in his father's memory. For thirty-seven years he was vice-president of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists.<br>
<br>Hollins's best work is considered to be equal to that of Chantrey, fine examples being his monuments to Sophia Thompson at Malvern Priory, Worcestershire (1838), and to the countess of Bradford at Weston under Lizard, Staffordshire (1842). He produced over sixty major works including several exhibited at the Royal Academy. Crippled with rheumatism in later years, he died at 17 Great Hampton Street on 16 August 1886 and was buried in the family plot in St Paul's churchyard, Birmingham.<br>
