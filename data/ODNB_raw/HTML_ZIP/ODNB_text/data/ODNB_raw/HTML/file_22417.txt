<span class="headword">Plunkett,  John Hubert</span>  (1802&#150;1869), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Australia</span>, was the younger of twin sons born to George Plunkett, farmer, of Roscommon, co. Galway, and Eileen O'Kelly of Tycooly, co. Galway, in June 1802 in Roscommon. He took his BA at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1824 and was called to the Irish bar in 1826. Successful on the Connaught circuit, his vigorous political advocacy was credited by Daniel O'Connell for the success of local candidates at the elections of 1830. With Catholic emancipation in 1829, and a whig government in office in Britain, Plunkett was appointed solicitor-general to Sir Richard Bourke, new governor of New South Wales, in 1831, at a salary of &pound;800 per annum. He arrived in Sydney in June 1832.<br>
<br>In the colony Plunkett also had the work of deaf Attorney-General Kinchela, prosecuting in ninety-one cases, securing convictions in sixty-four, and adding the attorney-generalship to his own office when Kinchela retired in 1836. His <span class="roman">Magistrates Act</span> abolished summary punishments and court hearings in private houses, and restrained the excessive use of the lash. After the Myall Creek massacre of an Aboriginal community he secured the death sentence for seven white men. His most important achievement, he believed, was the <span class="roman">Church Act</span> of 1836, which disestablished the Church of England and secured equality for Catholics and Presbyterians, and later Methodists; he himself was willing to include Jews and Independents. Plunkett became first president of the board set up to administer the act in 1839.<br>
<br>As a Roman Catholic, Plunkett was inescapably involved in the sectarian politics of New South Wales. In 1844 he supported the Lowe committee, which recommended the introduction of the Irish national system to provide combined secular education but separate religious instruction. On its introduction in 1849 he became first president of the national schools board. This involved continuing controversy with the Catholic hierarchy, headed by Archbishop Polding and Archdeacon McEncroe, although Plunkett considered secular education to include the truths of natural religion, God, the afterlife, and the ten commandments.<br>
<br>Plunkett was a member of the executive council from 1843. In 1856 he resigned his offices, entering politics relying on Irish sentiment, under the constitution he had helped to draft. Despite supporting W. C. Wentworth's much mocked hereditary upper house proposal, he was elected to the 1856 legislative assembly for Argyle county, where he held land. In 1857 he became president of the legislative council, resigning in 1858 when Premier Cowper dismissed him from the national schools board. He was then elected to the legislative assembly for Sydney. Austere and saturnine, and lacking flexibility and speed of decision, he was not a good politician: he alienated the anti-squatter vote over land title and the squatter vote over convict labour supply. Appointed to the legislative council by Governor Young, he held ministerial office from 1863 to 1865; his resignation as attorney-general brought down the Cowper government.<br>
<br>A founder member of Sydney University in 1849, and Catholic St John's College in 1858, Plunkett was vice-chancellor from 1865 to 1867. Deteriorating health led him to Melbourne, where he died on 9 May 1869. He was accorded a state funeral in Sydney. His name was borne in 1861 by a son of his liberal co-religionist, landed neighbour, and political colleague, Terence Aubrey Murray. Plunkett had no children with his wife, Maria Charlotte McDonougha (1813&#150;1895), whom he had married in 1832, and who died in Sydney in August 1895.<br>
