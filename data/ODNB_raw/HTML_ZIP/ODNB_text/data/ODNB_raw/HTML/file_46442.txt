<span class="headword">Borsselaer <span class="st"> [Bustler]</span>,  Pieter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1664&#150;1687), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was most likely of a Dutch burger family of that name long established in Zeeland, the Netherlands. From the fifteenth century onwards members of the family are recorded serving as regents, sheriffs, burgermasters, and taxation clerks in the towns of Middelburg and Goes. Two possible identifications of the artist have been suggested: the Pieter Borsselaer, dissenter, who married Maria Bijsterman in Goes town hall on 24 May 1644; or the Pieter Borsselaer, painter, presumably of a younger generation than the above, who in 1717 recorded his coat of arms, among others, in the privilege book of the Guild of St Luke at Middelburg (until 1940 in the Stedelijke Oudheidkamer of the town hall), of which he was a member from 1716 to 1731.<br>
<br>Borsselaer pursued his early career in England. Nothing is known about his training, or when he arrived in England. Buckeridge, who calls him Bustler and whose information is repeated by Walpole, calls him a history and face painter and refers to a picture of three boors, owned by Mr Elsum of the Temple, a collaborative work by Borsselaer (the figures), Prosper Henry Lankrink (the landscape background), and Abraham Hondius (a &#145;little Dog to one side&#146;; Buckeridge, 405). Only portraits are known to survive from his English period; these are painted in a distinctive manner closest to that of Gilbert Soest but sometimes employing weak perspective. Characteristic of his work is a direct, uncompromising treatment of appearance and character, and the use of particular shades, notably a leaf brown, plum red, and silvery grey. His <span class="italic">Portrait of a Widow</span> (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), signed and dated 1664, is his earliest dated portrait. Bought on the London art market in 1909, it most likely represents Mary Pakington, Lady Yate, related to the staunchly Roman Catholic Throckmorton family of Coughton Court, Warwickshire. A version of the portrait is at Coughton. In 1665 he signed and dated a portrait of the eminent antiquarian and herald Sir William Dugdale (priv. coll.), a powerful and expressive image of the ageing scholar, which has as its pendant a portrait of Lady Dugdale. Possibly dateable to around these years is his portrait (now lost) of the Dutch naval hero Cornelis Evertsen the elder (Evertsen was in England in 1664&#150;5), known through an engraving by Arnold de Jode. Staring suggests an acquaintance between Borsselaer and the Evertsen family, further borne out by a portrait of Evertsen the younger, attributed to Borsselaer, formerly at Middelburg town hall (no longer extant). A significant group of portraits, of members of the Hoby family and other figures, was until recently at Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, but is now partially dispersed. Two of the best, old <span class="italic">Sir Peregrine Hoby</span> and his wife, <span class="italic">Catherine Dodington</span>, were sold at Christies on 20 April 1990, while <span class="italic">Catherine of Braganza</span> and the less good <span class="italic">Charles II</span>, both inscribed on the reverse &#145;Peter Burlser, f.&#146;, are among those by him remaining at Bisham. It was Borsselaer's practice to make numerous copies of his portraits, especially of well-known sitters, which vary in quality. Several versions of his <span class="italic">Sir Orlando Bridgeman</span> (created lord keeper in 1667) are known, the earliest probably that formerly at Bisham; others are at Chirk Castle and Weston Park. The attribution to him of the posthumous &#145;Chesterfield&#146; portrait of Shakespeare (Shakespeare's Birthplace Trust, Stratford upon Avon) is probably correct, as is his authorship of <span class="italic">Samuel Butler</span> (NPG). One of his latest English portraits is <span class="italic">Admiral Cornelis Van Tromp</span> (Antony, Cornwall), commissioned by Ambrose Elton in 1675, &#145;whoe was with him [van Tromp] all the time it was doinge&#146; (these details inscribed on the portrait). Elton's own portrait, by Borsselaer, is at Clevedon Court, Somerset.<br>
<br>So far as Borsselaer's <i>&#339;uvre</i> can be reconstructed, his patrons seem for the most part to have been either staunch royalists or Roman Catholics. Borsselaer was probably a Roman Catholic too, and identifiable as the &#145;Petrus Bustler, Lymnr&#146;, of St Peter-le-Poer, Broad Street, in London, indicted for recusancy in 1673, and again in 1678 and 1679, but on the latter two occasions styled &#145;generosus&#146; of St Gregory's  (Bowler, 221, 238). The difficult political and religious climate probably impelled him to leave the country in 1679, or soon after. He is possibly the &#145;Monsr van Borssele&#146; living in The Hague, at Kleinen Blaesbalch, in 1681, who in October of that year is recorded, with the portrait painter Isaac Paling, paying his membership of the Confrerie Pictura there. His <span class="italic">Five Regents of the Middelburg House of Correction</span> (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; on loan to the Rijksdienst Beeldende Kunst, The Hague) is signed and dated 1683 (the &#145;8&#146; slightly indistinct); and in 1684 and 1687 payments to him are recorded in the Middelburg town archives for two allegorical chimney-pieces for the treasury chamber of Middelburg town hall (des. 1940). Painted on plaster, they celebrated the town's international trade with representations of the Four Continents, Religion, Freedom, and Justice.<br>
