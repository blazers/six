<span class="headword">Gower,  Elizabeth  Leveson-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Elizabeth Sutherland]</span>, duchess of Sutherland and <i>suo jure</i> countess of Sutherland  (1765&#150;1839), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 24 May 1765 at Leven Lodge, near Edinburgh, the youngest and only surviving child of William Sutherland, eighteenth earl of Sutherland (1735&#150;1766) and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1740&#150;1766), daughter and coheir of William Maxwell. Both parents died of &#145;putrid fever&#146; in Bath in 1766, leaving the family, for the first time in five and a half centuries, with no direct male heir. Lady Sutherland was brought up by her maternal grandmother, Lady Alva; her interests, as an orphan, were placed in the care of tutors whose directives were executed by the general commissioner of the Sutherland estates. The succession to the title was disputed by several claimants but her tutors successfully defended her case in the House of Lords in 1771, tracing her descent from William, earl of Sutherland, in 1275. She thus inherited, under an entail of 1706, the ancient earldom and estate of Sutherland, as well as lands acquired subsequently, notably the barony of Assynt.<br>
<br>Between 1779 and 1782 Elizabeth Sutherland was educated in London, and she lived mainly there and in Edinburgh. She married on 4 September 1785 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16539/', "George Granville Leveson-Gower, Viscount Trentham (1758&#150;1833)")</script>, known as Earl Gower from 1786, who in 1803 succeeded his father as second marquess of Stafford. The marriage settlement instituted a fresh enfeoffment in terms of the entail on the Sutherland estates, which were arranged on life rent to her husband. This was a prelude to further acquisitions of land in the county, including the Skelbo estate, so that by 1816 two-thirds of the county of Sutherland was in the hands of the Sutherland family. Further purchases of land continued to be made until the death of her husband in 1833, just six months after he was created duke of Sutherland. The huge highland estate had been heavily tied up in the hands of mortgagors who, from the 1790s, were progressively displaced to make way for a new management regime. A new philosophy of modernization and improvement (from the landowners' perspective) was inaugurated. Lady Sutherland (as she continued to be known) was the driving force behind much of the change, having shown interest in management questions since before her marriage. After 1803 the policy was accelerated, leading to a radical agrarian transformation of the estate which drew heavily on her husband's great wealth. Ambitious building and industrial projects grew as highland small tenants were removed from the interior to settlements on the coast. The family employed professional managers, notably James Loch, to undertake and shape the massive changes (and to bear the brunt of the vociferous criticisms of the policy). The countess visited Sutherland regularly and was fully apprised of the nature and consequences of these highly controversial changes. She was the target of great hatred in the northern highlands, though the policy of highland clearance also had its supporters, who considered the changes necessary, inevitable, and benevolent. Lady Sutherland endeavoured to counteract the adverse publicity surrounding the clearances, but with little success.<br>
<br>Like many aristocratic women of the period, Elizabeth Sutherland's interests were not confined to her estates. She accompanied her husband to Paris in May 1790 on his appointment as ambassador, at the height of the French Revolution, and wrote interesting descriptions of the political turbulence. She sent clothing to the imprisoned Marie Antoinette, an act which was reputed to be the last gesture of kindness shown to the doomed queen. The family experienced some difficulty in leaving France, finally departing in 1792. At the time Lady Sutherland's passport described her as &#145;five feet in height, hair and eyebrows light chestnut, eyes dark chestnut, nose well-formed, mouth small, chin round, forehead low, face somewhat long&#146;. In 1793 she raised a regiment, the Sutherland fencibles, which in 1798 was employed in quelling the Irish rising. In the 1790s, she and her husband were closely connected with George Canning, one of her many male admirers, who regarded her as beautiful, intelligent, and charming. Other women regarded her as rather overbearing. She became a leading hostess in London, where she gave sumptuous dinners attended by royalty, aristocrats, and statesmen from Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>Privately, Lady Sutherland spent much of her time raising her four children, sketching (she was a gifted watercolourist, and was especially accomplished in her landscapes of the Sutherland coast and of Dunrobin Castle), corresponding with Sir Walter Scott, and consuming snuff. She dominated her sons and probably her husband as well. One of the main aims of her life was to maximize the personal fortunes of both of her sons, George Granville (1786&#150;1861), who became second duke of Sutherland, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8585/', "Francis Egerton (1800&#150;1857)")</script>, created earl of Ellesmere, and to make the best marriages for her daughters, Charlotte Sophia (1788&#150;1870), who became duchess of Norfolk, and Elizabeth Mary (1797&#150;1891), who became marchioness of Westminster. From the death of her husband until her own death, the Scottish estates were administered separately on her behalf.<br>
<br>The duchess-countess of Sutherland, as she was known after her husband's elevation to a dukedom, died tranquilly on 29 January 1839 at Hamilton Place, Hyde Park, London. She was buried on 20 February, with great state, at Dornoch, in Sutherland.<br>
