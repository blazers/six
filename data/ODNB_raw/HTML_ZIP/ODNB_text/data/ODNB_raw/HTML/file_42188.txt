<span class="headword">Michele,  Charles Eastland  de</span>  (1809&#150;1898), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and consul</span>, was born at 63 Charlotte Street, Portland Place, London, on 27 February 1809, the youngest of five children, and the third son of Henry de Michele (1774&#150;1828) and his wife, Susan Manning (1770&#150;1854). His grandfather was Italian-born. Michele was educated at Westminster School from 1822 and practised as a solicitor until he became editor and part proprietor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, buying shares in the newspaper after the death of its owner, Nicholas Byrne, in 1832. He increased his holding to one-tenth in 1834. In 1841 Michele became the major shareholder, owning 121 of 240 shares, with overall control of the newspaper. On 28 February 1835 he married Mary, daughter of John Llewelyn of Morriston Hall, Swansea. Between 1836 and 1848 they had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, founded in 1772 by a group of tradesmen, was politically Conservative, articulating and representing the interests of Britain's landowners and fashionable society. According to the obituary of William Byrne, Michele's business partner, Byrne expanded the range of the paper beyond political reporting to reflect his interests in science and the arts. As editor Michele may also have contributed to the process, but his impact on the political direction of the paper was more profound. When the Protectionist Party, led by his friend Lord George Bentinck, opposed Sir Robert Peel's revision of the corn laws and the trend towards free trade, Michele championed their cause.<br>
<br>Dismayed, Byrne sought to revise their partnership agreement in 1844, claiming that Michele had sacrificed the paper's independence, reducing its circulation and profits. The issue was resolved in June 1845 when Michele bought out Byrne with money borrowed on a mortgage from T. B. Crompton, the Lancashire paper manufacturer who supplied the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. Michele invested in new machinery for the offices in Wellington Street and improved the premises, but in 1849 Crompton, citing his own trading difficulties, called in the mortgage. Michele turned to his political friends for financial assistance but they could raise only a few hundred pounds. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> passed to Peter Borthwick, beginning his family's long association with the paper.<br>
<br>The loss of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> in 1849 was the defining moment in Michele's life. His subsequent appointment as Britain's consul to St Petersburg was viewed with suspicion by the tories, but there is nothing in Michele's many accounts of his departure from the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> to support their claims that he was being rewarded for not opposing Palmerston or being removed because he had &#145;inconvenient information&#146;  (Koss, 79&#150;81). Fresh disaster beset Michele in the aftermath of the Crimean War. Since 1728 the salary of the post had been combined with duties levied on British shipping on the authority of the Russia Company, but neither British traders nor the Russia Company wished to resume the arrangement, which was subsequently prohibited by parliament. Without the levy, Michele's income was reduced by half, compounding the losses sustained during the war when he and his family had had to live on half pay in Brussels. Michele appealed to successive foreign secretaries (including Lord Malmesbury, whose assistance he had sought to maintain ownership of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>), and to Napoleon III, whose cause he had backed during the emperor's exile in England. Eventually awarded a pension, Michele retired from the consular service in 1866. His ill-fated involvement in public and official life left him in financial difficulties for many years.<br>
<br>On his retirement Michele invested in a London cement firm, Francis &amp; Co., which his youngest child, Vitale, an engineer, managed, later becoming a partner. Reading was Michele's main leisure activity. He occasionally held play-readings at the consulate, and often copied extracts from newspapers and books into his diaries. He died at his home, Old Palace Gardens, Weybridge, Surrey, on 19 February 1898 from a renal coma, and was buried in Weybridge cemetery, his will stipulating that his burial should be as simple as possible. Among his papers in the Bodleian Library are two photographs of him as a consul and a photograph of a miniature on ivory of Mary de Michele.<br>
