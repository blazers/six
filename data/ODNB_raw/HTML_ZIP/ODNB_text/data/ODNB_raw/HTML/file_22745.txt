<span class="headword">Price,  Daniel</span>  (1581&#150;1631), <span class="occ">dean of Hereford</span>, was born in Shrewsbury, the eldest son of Thomas Price (<i>d</i>. 1620). His father had been admitted as a preacher to the Shearmen's Company in 1578 and was irregularly granted in 1583 by Shrewsbury corporation the crown living of St Chad's, which he served as &#145;preacher&#146;, &#145;minister&#146;, and &#145;curate&#146; for the rest of his life. Evidently not a university graduate, Thomas Price was a native Welsh speaker, some of whose annotated books survive in the library of Shrewsbury School, which he may have attended; he was a strong godly influence on Daniel Price and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22764/', "Sampson Price (1585/6&#150;1630)")</script>. Daniel Price matriculated as a commoner at St Mary Hall, Oxford, on 14 October 1597. Before taking his degree he moved to Exeter College, &#145;where, by the benefit of a diligent tutor, he became a smart disputant&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.511). He graduated BA on 10 July 1601 and proceeded MA on 22 May 1604.<br>
<br>From 1607 to 1613 Price was rector of Wiston, Sussex, and from 1610 vicar of Old Windsor, in the gift of Lord Chancellor Egerton. In 1609 he gained admittance to the Middle Temple, and proceeded BD on 6 May 1611 and DD on 21 June 1613. In 1612 he was presented by Prince Henry to the rectory of Lanteglos, Cornwall.<br>
<br>Price was recognized as a frequent and remarkable preacher, &#145;especially against the papists&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.511), and achieved his greatest fame in this occupation at Prince Henry's court. In 1608 he printed his first sermon preached before the prince, <span class="italic">Recusants Conversion</span>, with a dedication to Henry seeking appointment as his chaplain. Although not named in the 1610 establishment list of the prince's household, he styled himself in print as Henry's chaplain-in-ordinary in the same year. By chance Price was one of the two chaplains attending in the month of Henry's death, November 1612, and therefore preached half of the routine sermons to the bereaved household before the funeral on 7 December. Early in the new year Price published six of these, all extravagant in their prose, their anti-Catholicism, and their eulogies for the prince. There followed two equally histrionic commemorative tracts on the first and second anniversaries of the prince's death, derived in title and imagery from John Donne's <span class="italic">Anniversary</span> elegies for Elizabeth Drury (1611, 1612). This body of work drew scorn from two leaders of emergent anti-Calvinism at Oxford, Richard Corbett and Brian Duppa, whose verses satirized Price's humble origins and evangelical Calvinism as much as his literary failings; Price's short verse rejoinder hardly disproves the latter.<br>
<br>In 1620 Price became rector of Worthen, Shropshire. Some time before 1623 he married Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1593), youngest child of the wealthy Shrewsbury lawyer Richard Prince and his wife, Dorothy Leighton. On 16 December 1623 Price was instituted dean of Hereford by royal warrant, and in 1624 became a canon residentiary there, and a justice of the peace for Shropshire, Montgomery, and Cornwall. He died at Worthen on 24 September 1631 and was buried in the chancel of the church there on 27 September. A story was circulated in 1633 that he had died a Roman Catholic, but this arises from a confusion of Daniel Price with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22765/', "Theodore Price")</script>, who had died in the same year.<br>
