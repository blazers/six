<span class="headword">Wilkes, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;1598), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was already an adult when first recorded in 1572. It is not known whether he originated from Sussex, as stated by Anthony Wood, from Wiltshire, or from the west midlands. His parentage and family are obscure, but he had relatives both in London and the Wolverhampton area. Seventeenth-century genealogies are demonstrably wrong. That a new coat of arms was devised for him implies obscure origins.<br>
<br>Wilkes stated that he spent eight years travelling in France, Germany, and Italy before settling in Oxford. Although nothing is known of his earlier education, he had surely been studying in Oxford for several years before he graduated BA in February 1573 and was appointed probationary fellow of All Souls College. He was immediately appointed secretary to Dr Valentine Dale, the newly appointed ambassador to Paris, doubtless on the strength of his continental experience and contacts. It may also be significant that he was already acquainted with and a correspondent of Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, who was to be his patron until he died in 1590. A letter from the privy council of 24 May 1573, perhaps originating with Dale, perhaps with Walsingham, secured Wilkes leave of absence from his fellowship.<h2>
<a name="Earlydiplomaticservice15741582"></a>Early diplomatic service, 1574&#150;1582</h2>It was only briefly that Wilkes played second fiddle to Dale. Never a resident ambassador responsible for continuing relations, he was constantly employed on special missions that required initiative and intrigue, and involved risks, not least to himself. In 1584 he stated that he had served Elizabeth I without regard for his life, reputation, or the difficulty of the task. Like Walsingham, he was a committed protestant and supported an aggressive foreign policy as a result. He understood military matters and was not averse to involving himself in them, he had a good grasp of complex affairs, and his reports are both lucid and contain sound recommendations. Late in life he admitted to his &#145;boldness oftentime used in presuming to yield my rude and raw opinion&#146; on matters of state to political superiors. He apologized while still pressing his case  (BL, Stowe MS 296 fol. 7<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>An early instance of the sort of mission at which Wilkes excelled occurred in 1574. In April he was commissioned directly to assure the Huguenot Henri Bourbon, king of Navarre, and Fran&ccedil;ois Valois, duke of Alen&ccedil;on, then incarcerated by the dowager queen, Catherine de' Medici, of Elizabeth's support. Having accomplished the mission Wilkes was placed in considerable danger when Alen&ccedil;on exposed him to Catherine: Navarre's intervention alone saved him from arrest. He was expelled from France and found himself disowned by Elizabeth, whose response to Catherine's complaint of 10 July was to blame Wilkes and instruct him to explain his actions to Catherine. Returning to France, he received a personal interview on 7 September at which he denied any plot and in doing so secured permission to remain in France.<br>
<br>Wilkes was recalled to England in February 1575 to embark on a sustained period of pro-Huguenot diplomacy. Dispatched first to the Rhineland, ostensibly to meet Sir Philip Sidney, Wilkes's main objective was to consult the Calvinist Frederick III Simmern, elector palatine, about how best to help the French Huguenots. He returned in April bearing the elector's preference for military intervention in support of Henri (I) de Bourbon, prince de Cond&eacute;, and a request for a subsidy of &pound;150,000. This sum was whittled down and agreed to in further missions from August 1575. Wilkes himself remained with the elector and participated in the ensuing invasion with his own men at his own charge until peace was agreed in June 1576. He went on a further mission to Spain in December 1577 to negotiate a compromise in the Netherlands. He was instructed to inform Philip II that Elizabeth favoured his rule in the Netherlands providing that his approach was conciliatory rather than coercive. In particular, the queen demanded that Don John of Austria be recalled. If Philip agreed, Elizabeth would help him overcome the rebels; if not, she would be obliged to help them. Although Wilkes secured no answer to his unpalatable and unacceptable message, he was treated quite well: Wilkes was not to know that Philip wanted him to depart &#145;before he commits some indiscretion that will force us to burn him&#146;  (MacCaffrey, 313). Returning via France on 16 February 1578, he was dispatched on 4 April via William the Silent, prince of Orange, to Don John of Austria to offer mediation and advocate a cease-fire, both of which suggestions were firmly declined.<h2>
<a name="Domesticduties15821586"></a>Domestic duties, 1582&#150;1586</h2>Bar a further mission to the Netherlands in 1582, Wilkes spent the next seven years in England. During these years he established his fortunes and started a family. About 1578 he had married Margaret (<i>c</i>.1562&#150;1596), daughter of Ambrose Smith, a London mercer, and his wife, Joan, of Coggeshall, Essex. Wilkes was rewarded in 1576 with the office of queen's printer, which he sold to Christopher Barker, and with one of the four clerkships of the privy council, which carried a salary of &pound;50 a year. In January 1579 a rota was agreed for the clerks, as was standard practice, Wilkes being assigned for duty during the months of May to August and November to December. His office placed him at the heart of decision making but provided him with only limited opportunity to pursue his own interests. Thus in 1581, when he pressed his own suit to the privy council, he was furiously berated for his impropriety by William Cecil, Baron Burghley, lord treasurer. Further efforts to advance his own interests were similarly unsuccessful. He complained to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, on 12 July 1584, after a request for preferment was interpreted by the queen as a plea to leave her service. Exaggerating his poverty somewhat and claiming that he had been paid only &pound;350 for twelve years' service, whereas &pound;400 had been received from the clerkship alone and as much again from Downton parsonage, Wilkes lamented how much he had depended on the largess of his father-in-law and on his creditors. He claimed he had incurred debts of &pound;500 that he could not repay and asked that he be permitted to reduce his costs by removing from Brentford, Middlesex, to Downton, Wiltshire. Since he was also unsuited to clerical work, he sought employment in some other capacity so that he could repair his credit or at least asked for the appointment of a third clerk to the privy council to enable him to retrench in other ways. He was still pursuing the balance of his wife's portion in 1587.<br>
<br>In 1585, perhaps in response to his complaints, Wilkes was granted a twenty-one-year monopoly on the import of white salt through King's Lynn, Boston, and (from 1586) Hull: regrettably it was not trouble-free and placed him at odds with popular opposition to monopolies in 1587&#150;8, when the Commons were induced to drop their attacks. In 1593 he had to discuss the matter with his parliamentary critics before a committee of the privy council. He could not afford to give the monopoly up. A further aspect of his domestic duties began in 1584 when Wilkes was elected MP for Downton. Wilkes's clerkship also entitled him to absences from government. Apparently he first settled at Brentford in Middlesex. It was as clerk of the privy council, not a resident, that he became a freeman of Southampton in 1581: he was three times elected Southampton's MP, in 1586 (when he declined), 1589, and 1593. Wilkes was fairly active in parliament. In 1582 the queen induced a reluctant Winchester College to lease him Downton rectory for forty years. Subsequently he presented his cousin Dr William Wilkes (<i>d</i>. 1637), a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, to the vicarage. He was re-elected MP for Downton in 1586. He was JP for Wiltshire from about 1583 to 1593, when he moved to Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, at which time he assigned his property at Downton to Carew Ralegh, elder brother of Sir Walter Ralegh. He was JP for Hertfordshire from about 1593, reflecting his establishment of himself in that county. He was employed on various important tasks, for example, in examining the Jesuit Edmund Campion on the rack in the Tower of London in 1581, seizing the books and papers of Thomas Norton, and inquiring into a minor conspiracy in the west midlands in 1583.<h2>
<a name="Theveteranambassador15861598"></a>The veteran ambassador, 1586&#150;1598</h2>Wilkes's diplomatic career reached its apogee in the Netherlands in 1586&#150;7. Leicester, dispatched to the Netherlands in 1585, accepted the role of governor-general of the Netherlands, contrary to Elizabeth's specific instructions, but she was persuaded during the spring of 1586 to accept the <i>fait accompli</i>. When she selected Wilkes in July 1586 to report on the state of the Netherlands, Leicester was at first highly enthusiastic. &#145;Wilkes hath exceedingly wisely and well behaved himself&#146;, he wrote. &#145;Her majesty does not know what a jewel she hath of him&#146;  (Bruce, 360, 383). His colleague Thomas Sackville, Baron Buckhurst, observed next year that Wilkes was &#145;so sufficiently practised in the estate of other countries and so well trained in your affairs at home, with such excellent gifts of utterance, memory, wit, courage and knowledge and with so faithful a heart to serve your majesty&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>). It was not therefore surprising that Wilkes was chosen to fill the English vacancy on the council of state. His own preference, set out in a lengthy discourse, opposed any accommodation with Philip and favoured the independence of the recently declared United Provinces. He argued that Elizabeth should accept sovereignty. Such views were not easily reconciled with his complex brief from the government, not fully known to Leicester, to reduce English expenditure, and promote harmony between the earl and the states general. Bolstering Leicester's authority was difficult when Wilkes fundamentally disagreed with aspects of his policy, notably the earl's solicitation of popular support against the town regents on whom alone, Wilkes thought, stability depended. Wilkes's independence and frank reports exposing Leicester's intrigues and errors were resented by the earl, who counter-attacked with malicious rumours that Wilkes had maligned Burghley. Wilkes also found himself at odds with Jan van Oldenbarneveldt, advocate of the states general of the United Provinces. In the face of Leicester's growing hostility to all his leading subordinates and the English embarrassment at Sir William Stanley's betrayal of Deventer, Wilkes, troubled by poor health, decided, in company with the general Sir John Norris, to take the extreme step of abandoning their posts without royal licence or informing Leicester, and returned to England in June 1587. They were ill-received: Norris was banned from the court and Wilkes was imprisoned briefly in the Fleet, then placed under house arrest with a friend.<br>
<br>Wilkes was felt to have at least partly justified his behaviour and his integrity was not long in doubt. Walsingham ordered &#145;he should be well-used for that he was not to be a close prisoner, but was only done for and upon a slightt displeasure conceived by her Majesty&#146;  (C. Read, <span class="italic">Mr Secretary Walsingham and the Policy of Queen Elizabeth</span>, 3 vols., 1925, 3.252). Such punishment, Leicester felt, was quite inadequate. &#145;Surely there was never a falser creature, a more seditious wretch, than Wilkes&#146;, he railed. &#145;He is a villain, a devil, without faith or religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Leicester, using his influence as the queen's favourite, was able to deny Wilkes his clerkship. Wilkes's petitions, even Walsingham admitted, could not avail against him&#151;and it was only on 4 August 1589, following Leicester's death, that he was returned to favour and was allowed to resume his clerkship. In September 1589 he took part in the renegotiation of England's treaties with the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Yet Wilkes's misdemeanour may have been disastrously mistimed. His recent disgrace no doubt disadvantaged him when the secretaryship of state fell vacant in 1590 on the death of Walsingham. Though repeatedly mooted for the post in 1590&#150;91, it was taken by Burghley himself and largely delegated to his son Sir Robert Cecil, who was duly appointed in 1596. Between 1596 and 1598 Wilkes wrote his &#145;Brief and summary tractate&#146; on the duties of a councillor. He dedicated it to Cecil. It is extant in a manuscript in the British Library's Stowe collection and detailed the qualities of an able royal servant, including diligence and professionalism.<br>
<br>Wilkes was dispatched to the Netherlands again in May 1590. One objective of this mission was to address England's ongoing military and financial commitment to her Dutch ally and to pressure the rebel leaders to make a greater contribution to the cost of England's war effort in the Netherlands. Wilkes was also instructed to ascertain the truth behind rumours that the Dutch had offered Henri IV sovereignty of the United Provinces in return for French support against Spain. Additionally he was to learn whether or not Philip had made peace overtures towards the rebel leaders. Apart from gaining the reassurance that neither report was true, the mission achieved little and Wilkes sailed for England in August. He was knighted in 1591.<br>
<br>Wilkes was sent once again to France in March 1592 to secure possession of several towns guaranteed by Henri in return for Elizabeth's assistance. He returned the following year to persuade Henri not to convert to Catholicism and to ensure that he maintained his anti-Catholic stance alongside Elizabeth. In September 1594 Wilkes was chosen to lead an embassy to Archduke Ernest, Spanish governor-general of the Netherlands. However, due to French and Dutch opposition, the mission proved abortive. He married Frances (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1576, <i>d</i>. in or after 1598), daughter of Sir John Savage of Rocksavage, Cheshire, and his wife, in or after 1596. They had a daughter, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1596&times;8), who outlived her parents. In February 1598 he accompanied Cecil on his final mission to France, but he died <i>en route</i> at Rouen on 2 March. Presumably he was buried there.<br>
<br>Wilkes took some care over his will before his death. He was anxious to fulfil his relatively minor obligations to the children of the Italian Giacomo Manetti, of whom he himself had been executor. His will dealt only with the leasehold and copyhold estate in Rickmansworth, which he left with plate, jewels, stock, and chattels to his widow, whom he made responsible for the education and marriage of their daughter. He left only &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. to his servant George Baynham and made no other legacies. That he doubted whether his moveables amounted to Margaret's &pound;300 marriage portion without restricting Frances's share and that he owed &pound;400 in short-term loans suggests that he died in far less affluent circumstances than might be expected of such a distinguished and prominent government servant. His will was proved on 12 May.<br>
