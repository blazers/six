<span class="headword">Pope,  Thomas</span>, second earl of Downe  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was baptized at Cogges, Oxfordshire, on 16 December 1622, the eldest son of Sir William Pope (1596&#150;1624) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Watson of Halstead, Kent. After his father's death his mother married Sir Thomas Peniston of Cornwall, Oxfordshire. His grandfather Sir William Pope (<i>bap</i>. 1573, <i>d</i>. 1631) of Wroxton Abbey, near Banbury, was made knight of the Bath in 1603 and a baronet in 1611; he was created Baron Belturbet and earl of Downe in Ireland in 1628.<br>
<br>On his grandfather's death on 2 July 1631 Pope succeeded to the earldom of Downe and the estates in north-west Oxfordshire settled on the family in 1555 by his great-uncle Sir Thomas Pope, founder of Trinity College, Oxford. However, Wroxton remained in the occupation of his father's younger brother, <a href="#cosubject_22535">Sir Thomas Pope, later third earl of Downe [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>The second earl was brought up at the house of his guardian, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75377/', "John Dutton (1594&#150;1657)")</script> of Sherborne, Gloucestershire [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72340/', "Dutton family (per. 1522&#150;1743)")</script>]. He married Dutton's daughter Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1656) on 26 November 1638, but claimed that he had been bullied into the match by his stepfather and that &#145;there was no liking&#146; between him and Lucy  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 4.450 n. c). In June 1639 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, as a nobleman. While there he attracted attention by fighting with William, son of Dr John Prideaux, rector of Exeter College, and had left the university by March 1641.<br>
<br>Downe's financial problems were evident before the civil war, for he was described as being destitute in 1640, when North Leigh Wood of 80 acres was sold to raise money for him. In the following year he complained of ill treatment by his stepfather and that his allowance was inadequate. His difficulties were exacerbated by the war, in which he was an active royalist, and by 1646 his estates between Oxford and Banbury were said to have been &#145;consumed by the King's garrisons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the &hellip; Committee for Compounding</span>, 934). His tenants protested that he and his grandfather had converted copyholds into leases and had evicted some tenants, replacing them with others.<br>
<br>In October 1645 the earl petitioned to compound for his delinquency. His estate was valued at &pound;2202 per annum, and his fine was set at &pound;5000. He had paid &pound;1000 by June 1646, but was unable to raise the remainder, which was still owing four years later. In May 1650 a bill was introduced in the House of Commons to permit him to sell manors and land to the value of &pound;4000 to raise the fine and to pay other creditors. This was redrafted as applying to property worth &pound;500 per annum, and in that form it was passed in February 1651. He retained the manors of Cogges and Wilcote, Coberley, Gloucestershire, which he held in the right of his wife, and Enstone. Edward Twiford became tenant of the remainder of his estates at an annual rent of &pound;1300, but excluding several farms, all of the woods, and the power to keep courts.<br>
<br>Countess Downe died on 6 April 1656, having &#145;fasted from eating or drinkinge&#146; for ten days before her death, and was buried at Coberley  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 4.450 n. d). Following her death the earl sold Coberley to Paul Castleman.<br>
<br>Shortly after the discharge of his sequestration, in April 1651, the earl left England and travelled in France and Italy. He died in the house of Arthur Tilliard, an apothecary, in St Mary's parish, Oxford, on 28 December 1660. He was buried at Wroxton on 11 January 1661. The only child of his marriage, Elizabeth, was born at Cogges on 15 April 1645 and married first Sir Francis Henry Lee, fourth baronet, of Ditchley, and second Robert Bertie, earl of Lindsey.<br>
<br>The peerage passed to Pope's uncle, <a name="cosubject_22535"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Pope</span>, third earl of Downe  (1598&#150;1668), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, the younger son of William Pope (<i>bap</i>. 1573, <i>d</i>. 1631), later first earl of Downe, and his wife, Anne (1561&#150;1625), widow of Henry, Lord Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1593), and daughter of Sir Owen Hopton and his wife, Anne Itchingham. He matriculated at Oxford in 1614 and was knighted at Woodstock in 1625. On 30 April 1636 he married Beata (<i>d</i>. 1678), daughter of Sir Henry Poole of Sapperton, Gloucestershire. The royalists imprisoned him at Oxford for six weeks during the civil war and he was held in 1656 on suspicion of complicity in the &#145;cavalier&#146; plot. He died on 11 January 1668 and was buried at Wroxton on 20 January. His only son, also Thomas, was born in 1630. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1658, and died on 18 May 1668, when the titles became extinct.<br>
<br>The succession to the Wroxton lease and estates was disputed between the three daughters of the third earl and their cousin, Lady Elizabeth Lee. In 1671 Frances Pope, one of the third earl's daughters, married Francis North, afterwards Lord Guilford, and in 1680&#150;81 he bought out the other coheirs and subsequently settled at Wroxton. A portrait of the second earl, attributed to Isaac Oliver, is at Wroxton. The third earl was painted by William Dobson.<br>
