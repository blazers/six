<span class="headword">Huniades,  Johannes</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>J&aacute;nos  B&aacute;nfi-Hunyadi]</span>  (1576&#150;1646), <span class="occ">chemist and alchemist</span>, was born at Nagyb&aacute;nya (Baia Mare) in Transylvania, the son of Benedict B&aacute;nfi-Hunyadi Mogyor&oacute;, from 1590 Calvinist bishop of the Trans-Tisza diocese. He served an apprenticeship as a goldsmith to a Nagyb&aacute;nya coiner and worked as a journeyman at Kassa (Ko&#353;ice, Slovakia) before deciding to leave in May 1606, when he asked his brother-in-law to look after his Nagyb&aacute;nya vineyard and pressing-house. He settled in London during 1608 and rented a workshop for his goldsmith's trade. In April 1613 he wrote again to his brother-in-law, requesting him to take care of his books, instruments, and gold and silverware until he returned to Nagyb&aacute;nya a year later. He was still in England, however, when on 15 July 1617 he presented the Bodleian Library at Oxford with a handsomely bound <span class="roman">Bible</span> published at Hanau, near Frankfurt am Main, in 1608 and completed at Kassel under the patronage of Prince Maurice of Hesse. A Latin poem written in it by Huniades is dedicated to Oxford University and to Prince Maurice, while a Hungarian inscription indicates his imminent departure for Hungary.<br>
<br>Huniades knew the mathematician Thomas Allen of Gloucester Hall, Oxford, and later obtained a copy of Allen's exposition of a work on astronomy by Ptolemy; the John Rylands University Library at Manchester also has a beautifully bound manuscript of Heinrich Khunrath's <span class="italic">Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae</span> (1609) which belonged to Huniades. Dedicated to John Dee and incorporating his occult &#145;Monas&#146; symbol, it was printed at Hanau in 1609 and anticipated the Rosicrucian manifestos of 1614&#150;15 published at Kassel, one of Europe's greatest centres of alchemy, which Huniades may well have visited on his way to England in 1608. Both these works, and two pages of alchemical quotes which he inscribed in a family album during 1620, suggest Huniades's strong interest in hermetic philosophy, as does his long relationship with Arthur, John Dee's son, the writer of Rosicrucian alchemical treatises, and physician to Queen Anne, James I's wife, at the time of Huniades's 1617 gift to the Bodleian Library. The &#145;friend&#146; to whom Arthur Dee paid &pound;100 in travel expenses to collect some &#145;prime matter&#146; (probably antimony) from Hungary in 1617 was clearly Johannes Huniades  (Sloane MS 1876). In 1619 Huniades married Dorothy, a daughter of Sir Francis Colton of Kent. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1620, and a son, John, born in the same year or in 1621<a href="#cosubject_71440"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, followed by two more children. Dorothy probably predeceased her husband.<br>
<br>A legal document of 1625 describes Huniades as a Whitechapel goldsmith but by 1635 he was registered as &#145;John Hunniades borne at Hunger an Alcamist&#146;  (SP 16/294). Jon Jonston, a distinguished Polish physician, writing in 1632 about the transmutation of metals in his book, translated in 1657 as <span class="italic">A History of the Constancy of Nature</span>, described his friend Huniades as &#145;the chief of all the Chymists in England&#146;. From Jonston's correspondence with Samuel Hartlib in 1633&#150;5 it is evident that he and Huniades shared a marked interest in Paracelsian iatrochemical medicines. During 1633 Prince Gy&ouml;rgy R&aacute;k&oacute;czi invited Huniades to become a professor at a Hungarian academy planned in Kolozsv&aacute;r (Cluj), Transylvania, but by then Huniades was giving regular courses of chemistry in London attended, for instance, about 1634, by John Webster. Hartlib's &#145;Ephemerides&#146; for May 1634 mentions a manuscript copy of Huniades's &#145;Systemata chymi&#146;, and an undated note (fol. 47/9/22A) envisages a London &#145;Publick or City University Laboratory&#146;, directed by Huniades, possibly connected with Hartlib's further note that Huniades, backed by Sir Kenelm Digby and others, was constructing a laboratory at Gresham College, Bishopsgate Street, in July 1640. It was in this large laboratory belonging to the medical professorship that Digby, assisted by Huniades, conducted some pioneering experiments on the chemical composition of plants between 1640 and 1641. A notebook of Jonathan Goddard, Gresham professor of physic in 1655, contains several references to Huniades's chemical operations by one of his former students, as well as considerable Latin and old German text, probably in Huniades's hand. One recipe involving a sealed alcohol thermometer (dating from 1641) suggests the earliest recorded use, by Huniades, of temperature measurement in distillation.<br>
<br>In April or May 1642 Huniades, who befriended Hungarian scholars in England, mentioned in a letter to P&aacute;l Medgyesi, Prince R&aacute;k&oacute;czi's chaplain, that he intended leaving Gresham College, where he taught chemistry, to move back into his house in St Mary's parish, Whitechapel, but he retained his post until at least the end of 1644. William Lilly, who had known Huniades since 1633, dedicating his <span class="italic">Anglicus, Peace or No Peace</span> (1645) to him on the eve of his departure for Hungary, praised his skill and learning as an alchemist which had won him fame in England and abroad. J. P. Gowy's untraced portrait of Huniades was engraved by Hollar in 1644 and a silver medallion struck. The inscriptions and symbols in William Marshall's 1646 engraving of another lost portrait cast much light on Huniades as an alchemist. A tax assessment places him still in London during February 1646. Huniades travelled with his family to Amsterdam that summer (intending to stay there for ten weeks before being joined by Arthur Dee for the journey back to Hungary) but died suddenly of the plague on 28 August 1646. The administration of his property was granted in London by decree to his son on 11 September 1647. The high esteem in which Huniades was held by his contemporaries may be gauged from the Dutch scientist Henry Appelius's correspondence with Hartlib in 1643, and in 1647 when enquiries were made about replacing Huniades with Johann Rudolph Glauber, the celebrated German chemist working in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_71440"></a><span class="headword">John Huniades</span>  (1620/21&#150;1696)<span class="occ"></span>, according to his acquaintance Aubrey, studied mathematics under William Oughtred, came from &#145;the familie of the King of Hungrie&#146;, and was chemist to the fifth earl of Pembroke, who gave him a pension of &pound;100. Aubrey's &#145;Faber fortunae&#146; has notes of his chemistry operations in the 1680s applied to industrial processes, activities which brought him into contact with fellows of the Royal Society such as Robert Hooke, Joseph Moxon, and Peter Perkins. Chancery proceedings documents reveal a commercial interest in Portugal (early 1660s) and substantial money made from securing property loans (1660&#150;95). In 1697 Adam Frank, a Hungarian Unitarian minister in London, informed a correspondent that Huniades's sister Elizabeth (1620&#150;1710) had inherited &pound;50,000 from her brother which she spent mostly on founding a hospital for the poor and on a monument to him. Elizabeth Stevenson, as she was when granted the administration of her brother's property on 31 December 1696, married Samuel Benson of Shoreditch soon afterwards. The inscription on the magnificent crypt monumental tomb she raised to her brother gives his age as seventy-five at his death on 15 November 1696; both it and her own striking memorial by Francis Bird in St Leonard's Church, Shoreditch, assert royal Hungarian descent and display the arms of the Benson family impaling the Hunyadi regal device of the black raven, but no evidence has been found to support this claim.<br>
