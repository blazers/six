<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1832), <span class="occ">writer and journal editor</span>, was born in Highgate on 9 August 1757, the eldest son of Ann Price and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27049/', "John Taylor (c.1724&#150;1787)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27048/', "Taylor, John (1703&#150;1772)")</script>]. His grandfather was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27048/', "Chevalier John Taylor (1703&#150;1772)")</script>, well-known oculist to George II, and his father followed the same profession with equal success, becoming oculist to George III. John Taylor received a basic education under Dr Crawford in Hatton Garden and at a school at Ponder's End, Middlesex. At first he followed the family profession, and with his brother, Jeremiah Taylor MRCS, was appointed oculist to George III. His love of the theatre, combined with an ability to write verse, however, gradually attracted him to journalism. For some time he was drama critic to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> before succeeding William Jackson as the paper's editor about 1787. He purchased the <span class="italic">True Briton</span>, and in 1813 went on to become editor and proprietor of <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, a violent tory paper. The existing editor, William Jerdan, owned a share in <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, and there was a bitter quarrel followed by two or three years' litigation before Jerdan was bought out by Taylor in 1817. In 1825 Taylor sold the paper to Murdo Young, who changed its politics.<br>
<br>As a writer Taylor is best known for &#145;Monsieur Tonson&#146;, a poem suggested by a prank of Thomas King, the actor. A dramatic version of the poem was read or rehearsed by William Thomas Moncrieff on 8 September 1821, but never publicly performed. When it was recited by John Fawcett at the Freemasons' Tavern, however, it drew large crowds. In a later publication (1830) it was illustrated by Richard Cruikshank.<br>
<br>At the Turk's Head Coffee House and the &#145;Keep the Line&#146; Club, Taylor mingled with the celebrities of his day. He wrote numerous addresses, prologues, and epilogues for the stage and was totally captivated by the theatrical world. Jerdan vividly describes him as &#145;a being of the artificial stage, not of the actual living world &hellip; looking for surprises and d&eacute;nouements; as if the game of life were a comedy or a farce&#146;  (Jerdan, 73). According to his own account he gave advice to Boswell on the eve of his publication of the <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span>. He entered into brief correspondence with Wordsworth who sent him a copy of the <span class="italic">Lyrical Ballads</span>, wanting to know &#145;what impression his poems, written by an author living in rural retirement, had made upon a man living in the bustle of active life&#146;  (De Selincourt, 1.325). In his later years Taylor wrote <span class="italic">Records of my Life</span> (1832), a work full of gossip and discreditable stories.<br>
<br>Taylor was married twice and wrote a number of moving sonnets about his first wife, who died young. He died in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, London, in May 1832. Other works by Taylor include: <span class="italic">Statement of Transactions Respecting the King's Theatre at the Haymarket</span> (1791); <span class="italic">Verses on Various Occasions</span>, including &#145;The stage&#146; (1795); <span class="italic">The Caledonian Comet</span> (1810); <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1811); and <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span> (1827).<br>
