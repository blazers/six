<span class="headword">Cleghorn,  Hugh</span>  (1752&#150;1837), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born on 21 March 1752 at The Society, Edinburgh, the only son of John Cleghorn (<i>d</i>. 1774), merchant and brewer, and his wife, Jean (1712&#150;1791), daughter of William Scott, professor of Greek at Edinburgh University, and Jean Fairbairn. The Cleghorns' only other child was a daughter, Magdalene. Hugh Cleghorn's family represented a solid alliance between well-to-do brewers and influential academics, among whom were William Hamilton, principal of Edinburgh University, and William Cleghorn, professor of moral philosophy there. William Cleghorn gave his &#145;dying voice&#146; for Adam Ferguson, one of the outstanding personalities of the Scottish Enlightenment, to be the next professor of moral philosophy at Edinburgh. Hugh Cleghorn was to be a student of Ferguson's at the university; he went there in 1764, at the age of twelve, because he wanted to study Greek and could not do so at the Edinburgh high school, where he began his education. Cleghorn's mind was thus formed by and imbued with the challenges of the Scottish Enlightenment and of Edinburgh at its most brilliant period in the eighteenth century. His own inclination was at first towards academic life: in 1773 he was appointed professor of civil history at the University of St Andrews. On 2 February 1774, in Old Greyfriars parish, Cleghorn married Rachel McGill (<i>d</i>. 1821), daughter of John McGill, and a relative of Adam Smith, who left the young Cleghorns &pound;400 in his will. It was early in their marriage that their two sons and five daughters were born; both the sons eventually followed careers in Madras.<br>
<br>Sixteen years in St Andrews proved to Cleghorn that it was too narrow a stage for his abundant energy and &#145;bigness of mind&#146;, as his friend William Adam phrased it  (Clark, 283). A passionate desire to travel led him to seize the opportunity to see Europe as &#145;bear leader&#146; to the tenth earl of Home. One of the most important results of this tour (1788&#150;90) was the friendship he formed in Neuch&acirc;tel with the comte de Meuron, whose mercenary Swiss regiment had been hired by the Dutch East India Company to guard Colombo and other Dutch garrisons in Ceylon. Cleghorn also acquired an appetite for politics, and his fertile mind was busy for schemes with an alliance between Britain and the Swiss cantons, which, if they launched an attack on the eastern frontier of France, might restrain the French from invading the Netherlands. These schemes brought him to the notice of Henry Dundas, the most influential government minister in Scotland, who, as president of the Board of Control, was able to ensure that the East India Company gave jobs to the many young Scots he recommended. Dundas found Cleghorn's intelligence reports valuable, and regarded him as another instrument to be used in furthering British interests in India.<br>
<br>Cleghorn wanted the government to safeguard Madras by extending British control to Ceylon. When de Meuron confided in Cleghorn how dissatisfied he was with the Dutch as paymasters, and when the French revolutionary armies invaded the Netherlands and William V of Orange fled to England, the opportunity arrived for Britain to get Ceylon into its sights, for William, in his &#145;Kew letter&#146;, ordered all commanders of Dutch forces to hand over forts under their command to the British. Dundas agreed with Cleghorn that, as de Meuron's Swiss regiment in Colombo constituted the only reliable force there, if these troops could be persuaded to change sides, Ceylon could be won without, in Cleghorn's words, &#145;great effusion of blood&#146;. So he and de Meuron were authorized in 1795 by the British government to go to Madras with all possible speed to bring about the transfer of the allegiance of the Swiss regiment to the British, and to end Dutch rule in Ceylon. Cleghorn hoped the element of surprise would add to Dutch confusion, so he tried to stop the comte boasting too loudly about his new rank of major-general during their journey to India. Once there, Cleghorn did go so far as to write to a friend, &#145;I am not here merely to eat mangoes&#146;  (Clark, 127). In the event, the plan worked: the Swiss obeyed their colonel's instructions, the Dutch governor surrendered after a token resistance, and the British army entered Colombo.<br>
<br>Cleghorn's return to Britain took him through Europe, and set his ever eager mind to planning how to frustrate Napoleon's drive into Italy. His plan impressed Dundas, who read it over with Pitt at Walmer Castle, although the treaty of Campo Formio made it irrelevant. In 1798 Dundas sent a reluctant Cleghorn back to Colombo as secretary of state under the governorship of Frederick North: Dundas, under pressure to exchange Ceylon for the Cape, wanted to keep both, and needed someone who shared his views on the spot. But the personal antipathy between Cleghorn and North, and the failure of the pearl fishery of which Cleghorn had been put in charge, led to his leaving Ceylon after only two years, with a charge of stealing pearls hanging over him. The charge was unfounded, as the official inquiry established, but it meant the end of Cleghorn's public career.<br>
<br>Cleghorn retired to Fife and set himself to &#145;improve&#146; his estates and enjoy his friends and his grandchildren, as far as his financial worries would permit. He had put the &pound;5000 given him by the East India Company for his first enterprise in Ceylon towards buying Stravithie, an estate in Fife just south of St Andrews, and had little spare capital and a somewhat meagre government pension. To add to his difficulties, William Campbell, a writer to the signet and the husband of Cleghorn's second daughter, Jane, attempted to avert his own financial ruin by using Cleghorn's name as security. Cleghorn accepted responsibility for the debt, but was so mortified by his own carelessness over money that he made Stravithie in its entirety over to his surviving son, Peter (1783&#150;1863), registrar-general to the supreme court in Madras. Following the death, in 1824, of Peter's wife their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101011/', "Hugh Francis Clarke Cleghorn")</script> was brought up by his grandfather. From 1831 Hugh Cleghorn lived on his pension in the family house, Wakefield, Stravithie, Dunino, Fife, where he died on 19 February 1837. He was buried in Dunino churchyard.<br>
<br>In the second half of the twentieth century Cleghorn's name acquired some notoriety in Sri Lanka (as Ceylon became in 1972). On his first visit in 1795 he had undertaken a tour of the northern coastal region, writing to Dundas, &#145;At present we are as ignorant of Ceylon as we are of Japan&#146;  (Clark, 138). He had had much conversation with Dutch settlers, officials, and lawyers, and after eight months as secretary of state, he set down what he had learned from them of &#145;the administration of justice and of the revenues under the Dutch government&#146; in a minute to Dundas of 1799. In 1954 the Tamils, looking for ammunition to sustain their claims to a separate homeland in the north and east of the island, seized on some phrases in Cleghorn's minute to justify them. For example, he asserted that &#145;Two different nations, from a very early period, have divided between them the possession of the island. First the Sinhalese, inhabiting the interior of the country in its southern and western parts. &hellip; and secondly the Malabars [Tamils] who possess the northern and eastern districts. These two nations differ entirely in their religion, language and manners&#146;  (de Silva, appx <span class="smallcap">B</span>). Throughout his life Cleghorn's enthusiasm for learning, from whatever situation he found himself in, remained undimmed. Whether he was exhorting his St Andrews students to read Adam Smith and John Millar, analysing his observations on Europe at war for Pitt and Dundas, or putting into practice scientific methods of farming on his own estate in Fife, he was always forward-looking and his ideas sparkled with &#145;bigness of life&#146;.<br>
