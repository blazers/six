<span class="headword">Castner,  Hamilton Young</span>  (1858&#150;1899), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 11 September 1858 in Brooklyn, New York, the second of three sons (there were no daughters) of Samuel Castner and his wife, Julia. His early education is unknown, but he attended the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute before enrolling in 1875 in Columbia University School of Mines. He left after three years without a degree, not from any lack of ability but because he selected from the course only those subjects&#151;analytical and applied chemistry&#151;which appealed to him.<br>
<br>In 1879 Castner and his elder brother, E. B. Castner, set up as consulting chemists in New York. The consultancy prospered, but some chemical processes which Castner developed were not successful commercially. About 1884 he sold his share and turned his attention to devising an improved process for manufacturing aluminium, a metal whose unique properties could not then be adequately utilized because of its high cost. Production at that time was by reducing aluminium chloride with sodium, which cost 14<i>s</i>. a pound. Castner devised a process, involving the reduction of caustic soda with carbon, by which the cost of sodium could be reduced to less than 1<i>s</i>. a pound. He failed to interest American industrialists and in 1886 travelled to England, thereafter the centre of his working life.<br>
<br>In England Castner aroused the interest of the Webster Crown Metal Company of Solihull, which was then manufacturing small quantities of aluminium at a cost of &pound;3 a pound. Substantiation of Castner's claim led to the formation in 1887 of the Aluminium Company. Potential annual output was 100,000 pounds. After initial difficulties, they succeeded in producing aluminium of high purity but in 1889 the process was rendered obsolete by the advent of a much cheaper electrochemical process invented independently in France and the USA. With characteristic resource Castner developed new uses for his cheap sodium, his only asset. From it he manufactured sodium peroxide, a valuable bleaching agent, especially for straw hats, and sodium cyanide for the booming gold-mining industry, particularly in South Africa.<br>
<br>The now misnamed Aluminium Company flourished, and it was difficult to keep pace with the demand for sodium. In 1890 Castner devised a new process for its manufacture, based on the electrolytic decomposition of caustic soda. Difficulties arose because of the relative impurity of even the best available caustic soda, and this led to his greatest success&#151;a process for manufacturing very pure caustic soda by the electrolysis of brine in a rocking cell containing mercury. Valuable by-products were chlorine (yielding bleaching powder for the textile and paper trades) and hydrogen. On seeking to patent his process, Castner discovered that a similar patent had been lodged in Germany by Karl Kellner and made over to the powerful Solvay Company in Belgium. To avoid expensive litigation, the two companies combined in 1895 to form the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company, with large works in Runcorn.<br>
<br>Castner's originality brought him little public acclaim, for the chemical industry was such that its products were largely the raw materials of other industries. Nevertheless, he ranked high among the pioneers of twentieth-century chemical technology. His life was clouded from the 1880s by the onset of tuberculosis, which led him to spend his winters in Florida. In spite of this, he had a remarkable record of achievement when he died, on 11 October 1899, at his home in Saranac Lake, Franklin county, New York state. He was unmarried.<br>
