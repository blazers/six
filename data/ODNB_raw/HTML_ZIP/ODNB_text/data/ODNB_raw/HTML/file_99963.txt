</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  John Henry  Harvey-</span>  (1924&#150;2008), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at 2 Queensdown Road, Hackney, Middlesex, on 16 April 1924, the son of Mervyn Stockton Harvey-Jones (1893/4&#150;1968) and his wife, Eileen Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson (1894/5&#150;1963). His father had served in the Indian army during the First World War, leaving with the rank of captain. At the time of his son's birth he was working for a bank in London, but he was later appointed tutor and guardian to the maharaja of Dhar, a state within the central India agency. Harvey-Jones spent his early childhood in India, returning to England at the age of six. He was educated at Tormore preparatory school at Deal in Kent, an unhappy period which ended in 1937 when he went to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. This was the starting point for a naval career which lasted until he joined Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1956. Appointed a midshipman in 1941, he served at first on HMS <i>Diomede</i>, which was engaged in patrol duties in the North America and West Indies station, and later joined the submarine service, in which he remained for the rest of the Second World War. After the war he went to Cambridge University to learn Russian and later served as an interpreter and liaison officer in naval intelligence, principally in Germany; he rose to the rank of lieutenant-commander and was appointed MBE in 1952. On 26 July 1947 he married Mary Evelyn Atcheson (<i>b</i>. 1921), daughter of Francis Felix Bignell, &#145;gentleman&#146;. (She had changed her name by deed poll before her marriage.) They had one daughter, Gaby.<br>
<br>Harvey-Jones's decision to leave the navy was taken mainly for family reasons. His daughter had contracted polio, and since the treatment was likely to be difficult and lengthy he needed a job where he could be sure of getting home in the evenings. Two of his navy colleagues had recently started work at ICI, and their enthusiasm for the company encouraged him to join them. In 1956 he was taken on as a work study officer at the Wilton works near Middlesbrough, the newest of ICI's complex of factories on Teesside.<br>
<br>ICI was the giant of the British chemical industry, and it was expanding rapidly, especially in petrochemicals, plastics, and fibres, with much of the new investment going into the Teesside factories. It was also beginning to embrace modern management techniques, a process that accelerated after the appointment of Sir Paul Chambers as chairman in 1960. Chambers, who had held senior posts in the Inland Revenue, was the first non-scientist to head ICI. Among his innovations was to bring in McKinsey, the American management consulting firm, to advise on changes in the organization of the company.<br>
<br>As a work study officer Harvey-Jones obtained a useful insight into factory management at the shop-floor level, and his contacts with shop stewards proved valuable in his subsequent dealings with trade unions. After two years in work study he was appointed supplies manager at Wilton, then sales manager, and later personnel director within the heavy organic chemicals division (later renamed the petrochemicals division), which embraced both Wilton and its sister plant at Billingham. In 1970, to his own surprise and that of colleagues, he was made chairman of the division, in preference to two deputy chairmen who had the technical qualifications that Harvey-Jones lacked and longer service in ICI. Three years later he was appointed to the ICI main board and moved to London.<br>
<br>The 1970s were difficult years for ICI. The post-war boom was over, and several of the products that had driven the chemical industry's growth in the earlier post-war decades, such as plastics and fibres, had acquired the status of commodities, subject to bouts of overcapacity and falling prices. As a main board director Harvey-Jones was given oversight responsibility for the fibres division, and he presided over a drastic contraction of this business, including withdrawal from Terylene, the polyester fibre that had been a big profit earner in the 1950s and 1960s.<br>
<br>While the problems in fibres were extreme, the chemical industry as a whole was entering a period of maturity, and as a junior member of the board Harvey-Jones was frustrated by ICI's sluggish response to what had become a much more competitive environment. As he wrote later, he began to feel &#145;that the whole way in which we operated was wrong and needed fundamental change&#146;  (Harvey-Jones, <span class="italic">Getting It Together</span>, 327). In 1974 he and two colleagues suggested some organizational reforms, aimed at enabling the board to set clearer objectives and to communicate them more effectively to the divisional heads, but their proposals won no support. As Harvey-Jones saw it, there was no vision on the board of what the company should be, and little discussion of strategy. There was an inertia about decision making at the Millbank head office, which meant that investment funds were allocated across the divisions in line with established practice instead of going to the areas that offered the best prospects of profitable growth. ICI was a &#145;rather self-satisfied institution&#146;  (ibid., 326), doing just well enough not to be forced to change its ways. It would take a major crisis to shatter this complacency.<br>
<br>That crisis came with the severe recession of 1980&#150;81, precipitated by the anti-inflationary policies of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. A combination of high interest rates and increasing oil production from the North Sea led to a sharp increase in the exchange rate, which had a devastating effect on the profitability of exporters such as ICI. ICI reported a loss in the third quarter of 1980&#151;the first loss in its history&#151;and to the consternation of its investors the dividend was cut. Sir Maurice Hodgson, who had taken over the chairmanship in 1978, set in train a fierce cost-cutting drive; nearly 30,000 jobs in the UK were eliminated between 1979 and 1983. The biggest losses were in the petrochemicals and plastics division, and there were fears that some of these businesses might have to be closed. Fortunately ICI had bought a stake in the Ninian oilfield in the North Sea some years earlier, and profits from this source partially offset losses in other parts of the group.<br>
<br>Harvey-Jones had been made one of ICI's three deputy chairmen in 1978 and was thus a potential successor to Hodgson. His appointment to the chairmanship in 1982 came as something of a surprise, and probably reflected the board's view that he was the most likely of the three candidates to challenge the <i>status quo</i> and to give ICI the new sense of direction that was needed. Whereas previous chairmen had stayed in post for only three or four years, Harvey-Jones was asked to serve for a minimum of five years.<br>
<br>Harvey-Jones's priorities when he took on the top job were to lighten the bureaucracy at the centre, to speed up decision making, and to strengthen the board's ability to provide strategic direction. The size of the head office staff in Millbank was cut from 1200 to 400 and two-thirds of the space was sold. The number of executive directors was reduced from sixteen to eight, and within this smaller, more collegiate board the directors were required to focus on the group as a whole, without the distraction of having special responsibility for particular divisions and overseas companies. On strategy, Harvey-Jones believed that ICI should shift away from commodity products towards higher margin and less cyclical &#145;effect&#146; businesses&#151;that is, chemicals that sold on the basis of the effect they produced, such as paints, dyestuffs, and pharmaceuticals. While ICI already had some businesses of this type, he looked to acquisitions as a means of speeding up the transformation. Since the failure of Chambers's attempt to take over Courtaulds in 1962, there had been a lack of enthusiasm in Millbank for takeovers, especially if they were likely to be resisted by the target company. Harvey-Jones was determined to be bolder, and set up an acquisitions unit to study takeover opportunities. Three of the largest acquisitions involved American companies: Beatrice, bought for its expertise in advanced materials; Glidden, a decorative paints maker, which complemented ICI's strength in the UK through its Dulux brand: and Stauffer, which had a strong position in agricultural chemicals. These takeovers also helped to reduce ICI's dependence on its traditional markets in the UK and the Commonwealth. Some investments had been made in continental Europe and the USA during the 1970s, but most of them had taken the form of large chemical complexes similar to those that ICI operated in the UK. ICI had been seeking to compete across the board against local companies that were already well established in these markets. The new approach was more selective, aimed at sectors where ICI, through superior technology, should have a competitive advantage.<br>
<br>Within the UK, Harvey-Jones was willing to pull out of businesses that had been part of ICI's heritage but no longer generated an acceptable return. This policy had been started by his predecessor&#151;a notable event was the sale of ICI's polythene business to British Petroleum&#151;and several other divestments took place during Harvey-Jones's chairmanship. Towards the end of his term of office he put forward a more radical plan, to sell all ICI's heavy chemicals businesses, which by then had been grouped together in a free-standing subsidiary, ICI Chemicals and Polymers, to one of the oil companies. Detailed discussions were held with British Petroleum and Shell, but no deal was done. Another missed opportunity was the failure to clinch what might have been an attractive acquisition in pharmaceuticals. By the 1980s ICI's pharmaceutical division had emerged after a long period of low returns as one of the company's biggest profit earners; one of its drugs was the heart disease treatment Tenormin, which became the world's most successful beta blocker. There was a strong case for expanding this division, and ICI came close to acquiring Beecham, the consumer products company that had been outstandingly successful in antibiotics. These negotiations advanced a long way, and ICI made a provisional agreement to sell Beecham's branded consumer products to Unilever. However, senior executives in the pharmaceutical division were unenthusiastic&#151;they preferred organic growth&#151;and the ICI board decided not to proceed.<br>
<br>By the time of Harvey-Jones's retirement in 1987 ICI's portfolio had been partially reshaped, though not as radically as he had hoped. In terms of profits, the company was in a much healthier state than it had been five years earlier. Pre-tax profits had risen from less than &pound;400 million to over &pound;1 billion, an increase in the return on assets from 7 per cent to 18 per cent. A large part of the improvement reflected the recovery in the British economy, and Harvey-Jones was also the beneficiary of the painful decisions taken by Hodgson in 1980 and 1981. Nevertheless, his five years at the helm marked a break with the past, making ICI less stuffy, more agile, and more responsive to the changes that were taking place in the world chemical industry. The fact that he was a late entrant to ICI, and not a scientist or engineer, gave him a perspective on the company that was different from that of his predecessors. Although relations with his board colleagues were uneasy, his approachable style and lack of pomposity won him great affection among ICI employees, and helped to lift morale after a period in which the company had been in retreat.<br>
<br>Harvey-Jones was an unusual chairman in other respects. While previous chairmen had mostly shunned the limelight, he did not hesitate to speak out on controversial policy issues. In particular, he criticized what he saw as Margaret Thatcher's indifference to the damage her policies were doing to manufacturing industry. (He thought this criticism&#151;and his decision to join the Social Democratic Party in the early 1980s&#151;might make him the only ICI chairman not to be given a knighthood; but he was given this honour in 1985.) He also attacked the City for its persistent undervaluation of industrial companies, and for what he saw as the vastly inflated salaries earned by City practitioners. He set out these views in his Dimbleby lecture in 1986, which was entitled &#145;Does industry matter?&#146;<br>
<br>With his long, unruly hair and his garish ties, Harvey-Jones cut an unconventional figure among Britain's business leaders, and enjoyed considerable attention in the media. After he left ICI he was asked by the BBC to participate in a series of programmes&#151;entitled <span class="italic">Troubleshooter</span> (1990)&#151;in which he visited British companies, assessed their strengths and weaknesses, and advised them on what they should do next. This advice was presented in a trenchant style, and not much appreciated by some of the managers who were on the receiving end of Harvey-Jones's sarcasm, but it made for entertaining television. Through these programmes, which were watched by an audience of more than 3 million, Harvey-Jones became the country's best-known industrialist. With his down-to-earth, self-deprecating manner, he gave a human face to business. Such was the success of the programmes that further series were broadcast in 1991, 1992, 1995, and 2000.<br>
<br>During his time at ICI, Harvey-Jones was a non-executive director at Reed International and Grand Metropolitan; the former gave him valuable experience in the handling of acquisitions, while the latter gave him an insight into a service-based business, closer to the customer than most parts of ICI. After his retirement, in addition to his television career, he served as chairman of <span class="italic">The Economist</span> for several years, and he took on several other directorships. Outside business the two appointments that gave him most satisfaction were as chancellor of Bradford University (1986&#150;91) and as president of the Multiple Sclerosis Research Charitable Trust (1999&#150;2008). He also wrote several books, of which the most successful were <span class="italic">Making It Happen: Reflections on Leadership</span> (1988) and the largely autobiographical <span class="italic">Getting It Together: Memoirs of a Troubleshooter</span> (1991). He suffered two minor strokes in the mid-1990s and lived quietly thereafter with his wife and daughter in Hay-on-Wye. He died in Hereford County Hospital of multiple causes after a long illness, on 10 January 2008. A memorial service was held in Hereford Cathedral on 17 April.<br>
