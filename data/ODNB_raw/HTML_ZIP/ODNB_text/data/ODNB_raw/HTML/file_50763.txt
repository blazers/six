<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Huxley,  Margaret Rachel</span>  (1854&#150;1940), <span class="occ">nurse and promoter of nurses' training</span>, was born on 21 December 1854 at Thornton Heath, Croydon, Surrey, the daughter of William Thomas Huxley, clerk at the Brighton railway, and his wife, Esther Hopkins. Margaret was a niece of Thomas Henry Huxley (1825&#150;1895). At an early age she was influenced by the work of Florence Nightingale, and, in spite of strenuous opposition from her family, she decided to take up nursing. Miss Huxley began her training in 1880 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, shortly before Ethel Manson, the future Mrs Bedford Fenwick, was appointed matron of the hospital. Miss Manson was passionate about the development of nursing as a profession for women and Miss Huxley was influenced by her ideas. The two young women became friends, and for the rest of their lives they worked to promote the professional development of nurses and nursing.<br>
<br>On completing her two years' training Miss Huxley was appointed matron of the National Eye and Ear Infirmary in Dublin. Her talents were soon recognized and within a year she was invited to take up the position of matron of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, a small general hospital serving a working-class area of Dublin. As matron and lady superintendent with responsibility for training the nurses, she was able to introduce a &#145;modern&#146; training scheme with lectures and a final examination. The standard of nursing improved so much that Miss Huxley proposed the establishment of a central school that would extend the benefits of theoretical instruction to nurses in the many small hospitals in Dublin. The Dublin Metropolitan Technical School for Nurses opened in 1894, with the support of the medical establishment, and it operated successfully for over sixty years.<br>
<br>Miss Huxley retired from Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital in 1902 but continued to be involved in nursing work through her private nursing home Elpis, in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. This nursing home, which opened in 1890, was the first of its kind in Ireland, providing private patients drawn from Dublin's middle-class protestant community with medical and surgical nursing care. The nursing staff were trained at Sir Patrick Dun's and the reputation of the nursing home brought credit to the hospital. Miss Huxley was honoured by the hospital when she was appointed the first woman governor in 1912.<br>
<br>After her retirement Miss Huxley became more involved in the professional side of nursing. Through her London contacts she was a founder member of the British Nurses' Association (later the Royal British Nurses' Association) in 1887, of the Matrons' Council in 1894, and of the International Council of Nurses (ICN) in 1899. In Ireland she was the prime mover behind the founding of the Irish Matrons' Association in 1903 and the Irish Nurses' Association (INA) in 1904. The priority of all these organizations was to achieve state registration for nurses. As vice-president of the National Council of Nurses of Great Britain and Ireland (NCN) she attended the international conferences of the ICN over many years, meeting the leading personalities in the nursing field. In 1913, during her term as president of the INA, she hosted the annual conference of the NCN, bringing a professional nurses' conference to Dublin for the first time.<br>
<br>Throughout the long campaign for state registration Miss Huxley represented Irish nurses at a national level, giving evidence to the House of Commons select committee on registration for nurses in 1904, as the representative of the INA on the central committee for the state registration of nurses, and as vice-president of the Society for the State Registration of Trained Nurses in 1914. By the time the British government passed the <span class="roman">Nurses' Registration Acts</span> in 1919, introducing state registration in England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, Ireland was seeking independence and Irish nurses were forming their own organizations. Miss Huxley was not sympathetic to Irish nationalism, believing more in the international aims of professional nurses. Although she was a member of the first General Nursing Council for Ireland, from 1920 to 1923, and also acted as an examiner for the council for several years, her role as a leader of Irish nurses was over.<br>
<br>Miss Huxley took a special interest in public health and the housing of the poor, a subject with which she was familiar through her work at Sir Patrick Dun's. She devoted time and money to improving housing conditions in Dublin, advocating that better living conditions would improve the hygiene and health of the poor. She set up the Huxley Trust Fund, through which well-planned cottages were built in the Coombe area of the city. During the First World War she worked on behalf of the Red Cross Society and as the matron of Dublin University Voluntary Aid Detachment Hospital. After the war she served for many years on the committee of the Nation's Tribute to Nurses, a fund to assist nurses whose health had been broken by war service. She played an active role in the politics of her profession until she was over eighty years old. She died at Elpis on 10 January 1940 after a short illness. Her funeral was held on 13 January at the Unitarian church, Dublin, and she was buried in the city's Mount Jerome cemetery. She was unmarried.<br>
<br>Miss Huxley was a woman of simple tastes who preferred deeds to words. When she retired as matron from Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital she inaugurated the Margaret Huxley memorial medal for the best nurse in training. She disliked publicity and honours and refused to accept the Royal Red Cross for her work during the First World War, though she accepted honorary membership of the Finnish Nurses' Association in 1925 and an honorary MA degree from Dublin University in 1928.<br>
