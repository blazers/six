<span class="headword">Coldwell,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1596), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born in Faversham, the elder son of Robert Coldwell, gentleman of that town, and his wife, Rycharden Thurston of Eastling, Kent. In 1560 John Coldwell became the lessee of the ancient hospital of the Maison Dieu in Ospringe, on the outskirts of Faversham. It was owned by St John's College, Cambridge, where he had matriculated in 1551, when he was probably in his middle to late teens, and graduated BA in 1555. He proceeded MA in 1558 and was admitted to the fellowship in the same year. In 1564 he became a doctor of medicine, practising for some years in Kent (he corresponded with a well-known local surgeon, John Hall of Maidstone). Coldwell was ordained deacon in London in 1569 and became chaplain to Archbishop Matthew Parker, and perhaps also his personal physician. He held two livings, both in Kent: he was instituted rector of Tunstall on 13 June 1572, and rector of Saltwood with Hythe in November 1582. In July 1571 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Chichester, but had resigned by 14 May 1575. On the recommendation of Archbishop Grindal he was installed dean of Rochester on 26 September 1581, a position he held for ten years.<br>
<br>When John Piers, bishop of Salisbury, was translated to York early in 1589, Coldwell was promised the vacant see by Lord Burghley. He was not consecrated, however, until 26 December 1591. The delay was caused by manoeuvres at court, centring on a rival candidate (John Thornborough, who had the support of Sir Francis Walsingham) and, still more, on Sir Walter Ralegh's determination to secure the manor of Sherborne, the most valuable property of the see. At the end of August 1590 Coldwell wrote to Burghley expressing anxiety, but the hold-up continued, and he only secured his elevation by promising Ralegh a ninety-nine-year lease. The temporalities were restored on 14 January 1592, and within a week the dean and chapter were being required by the crown to confirm Coldwell's lease to Ralegh of the Sherborne estate.<br>
<br>Coldwell was enthroned, and installed as prebendary of Potterne, on 3 January 1592. He subsequently faced further demands from Ralegh for leases of episcopal manors, and to add to his difficulties he also inherited a running battle with the citizens of Salisbury arising from the bishop's lordship over the city, laid out on episcopal land by Bishop Poor in the early thirteenth century. The bishop reserved to himself the profits of fairs and markets and significant legal powers. Particularly resented was the fact that the mayor had to take his oath of office before the bishop or one of his officials, emphasizing the city's subservience and frustrating the citizens' ambitions for the freedom implicit in a charter of incorporation. The bishop's overlordship had been confirmed by letters patent in 1472, and again by a charter granted to Bishop Jewel in 1561. Nevertheless by 1591 the citizens were once more agitating for a charter, and although Coldwell seems to have been conciliatory at first, in 1593 they obtained writs of <i>quo warranto</i> against him, accompanied by a list of complaints against the bishop and his officers. Allegations of assault on mayoral officials and citizens suggest that the bishop's men could indeed be brutal and arbitrary. However, their differences remained unresolved during Coldwell's lifetime, and it was only under his successor, Henry Cotton, that a more conciliatory relationship was established, with the city obtaining its charter in 1612.<br>
<br>Coldwell's difficulties with the city administration did not prevent his being an active and effective bishop, carrying out diocesan business to within a month of his death. On 13 June 1593 he held a visitation of his cathedral, walking there through his private garden because of an outbreak of plague which had forced many people to flee the city. Its record, preserved in his register, reveals considerable slackness. Ministers and others did not come to church as diligently as they ought; there was some default in keeping the preaching turns; vicars-choral had been admitted with a test of &#145;their ability and sufficiency in voices and knowledge&#146;; holy communion was satisfactory &#145;saving for the provision of bread and wine, there is default in the treasurer, which doth not supply it as he ought to do&#146;. The cathedral fabric showed &#145;some decays, which are yearly amended as we may&#146;, and &#145;the church and choir is not decently kept for lack of sweeping, nor the clock duly kept, neither the bells rung to service as they should be&#146;  (Salisbury Cathedral Library, chapter act book 16, fols. 24&#150;30). It is not known whether matters improved subsequently.<br>
<br>Coldwell was the first bishop of Salisbury to be married. With his first wife, Jane, daughter of Walter Henley of Lancashire, gentleman, he had five sons and a daughter. There were no children of his second marriage, to Clare, daughter of John Toke of Great Chart, Kent, esquire, and widow of Nicholas Moore of Elham, Kent, gentleman. He left no writings except a few letters. He died, at Salisbury, on 14 October 1596, in such poverty, according to Sir John Harington, that he had to be buried &#145;suddenly and secretly&#146; in the grave that had once been Bishop Wyvil's in Salisbury Cathedral  (Cassan, 82). No will survives. Administration of his goods was granted to his son Charles.<br>
