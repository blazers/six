<span class="headword">Odell,  Thomas</span>  (1691&#150;1749), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the son of a substantial Buckinghamshire landowner. About the age of twenty-three he went to London, where through the interest of Lord Wharton he secured a pension from the government. But the death of Wharton in 1715 &#145;and some other accidents&#146; left his fortunes &#145;somewhat impaired&#146;  (Mottley, 270) and Odell was thrown back on his own resources.<br>
<br>Odell turned to the theatre for a profession, and on 19 January 1721 his first play, <span class="italic">The Chimera: a Farce</span>, was performed at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and ran for three nights. He was later to write other dramatic pieces, but his major venture was the building of a new theatre in Goodman's Fields. There were only three theatres in London at this time, and so the building of a fourth represented a significant expansion, occasioned by an increase in the popularity of the stage resulting from the success in 1728 of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> and Sir John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span>. The new theatre opened in 1729, the first production being George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> on 31 October. This speculation proved a success; the new company achieved an impressive 185 performances in this first season, mostly of contemporary comedy, and Odell &#145;got not less than one hundred pounds a week by this undertaking&#146;  (Baker, xxxiv).<br>
<br>But opposition to the new playhouse had started before its opening, with application to the justices &#145;to prohibit the theatre&#146;  (Avery, xxi). Soon after the opening Arthur Bedford, a lifelong opponent of the stage, preached a sermon at St Botolph, Aldgate, against the newly erected playhouse, warning that the &#145;apprentices and journeymen of a leading part of the city would be led into dissipation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span>). As a result on 28 April 1730 a petition was sent to the king from &#145;the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of the City [of] London addressing his Majesty to suppress it&#146;  (Mottley, 270). Odell was forced to close the theatre temporarily, but he reopened it on 16 September 1730. The second season saw less opposition, but Odell sold the theatre in 1732 to Henry Giffard, an actor in his company who had arrived from Ireland in 1730, the final performance under Odell being on 23 May. The impending sale was a subject of rumour long before this date; a playbill for <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</span> dated 4 June 1731 has the following footnote:<blockquote>NB The article in the <span class="roman">Daily Advertiser</span> of Wednesday last (June 2) which mentions Mr Odell's intending to decline concerning himself any longer with the management of Goodmans Fields playhouse, is a false and scandalous libel, for which the printer &amp;c of the paper will be prosecuted with the utmost severity by me. Tho. Odell. (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 3.320)</blockquote>The truth seems to be that Odell did not have the acumen and determination to succeed as a theatre manager. Giffard, on the other hand, did, and under his management the theatre prospered, and was soon replaced:<blockquote>Mr Odell, from not understanding the management of a company (as indeed how should any one, that is not, in some way, brought up in that knowledge?) soon left it to Giffard that did; who in the year 1733 caused to be built an intire, new, beautiful convenient Theatre. (Chetwood, 169)</blockquote>The new theatre was in Ayliffe Street, and it was in this new theatre that Garrick was to give the first performance of his London career in 1741.<br>
<br>In 1738 Odell began a new career. William Chetwynd was sworn in as licenser of the stage in February, and Odell was appointed deputy &#145;that he [Chetwynd] might not be too much fatigued with reading half a dozen plays in the course of a twelvemonth&#146;  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 3.522). Odell was to hold this position for the rest of his life. Odell was the author of a number of other dramatic works: <span class="italic">The Smugglers: a Farce</span> (1729), <span class="italic">The Prodigal, or, Recruits for the Queen of Hungary</span> (1744), <span class="italic">The Patron: a Ballad-Opera</span> (1729), as well as several poetical pieces.<br>
<br>At the end of his life Odell was living in somewhat impecunious conditions, and at his death was engaged on an account of his experiences and acquaintances. He had not made a great success in the theatre as either a manager or an author: &#145;It does not seem that he possessed the ambition peculiar to author-managers, having produced no piece at his own theatre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span>). But he was remembered as<blockquote>a great observator of everything curious in the conversation of his acquaintance; and his own conversation was a living chronicle of the remarkable intrigues, adventures, sayings, stories, writings etc of many of the Quality, Poets and other Authors, Players, Booksellers &hellip; (Oldys, 161)</blockquote>Odell died of &#145;gout in his stomach&#146;  (ibid.) on 24 May 1749, at his house in Chapel Street, Westminster, and was buried at the Chapel Street churchyard. He was married, but nothing is known of his wife.<br>
