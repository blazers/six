<span class="headword">Nicholson,  William Edward <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1919&#150;2004), <span class="occ">footballer and football manager</span>, was born on 26 January 1919 at 15 Vine Street, Scarborough, Yorkshire, the second youngest of the nine children (five sons and four daughters) of Joseph Nicholson and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gowan. His father looked after horses, working in the winter as a groom and in the summer as the driver of a horse-drawn cab along the front at Scarborough. Bill was one of two children in the family who managed to pass the scholarship examination to Scarborough high school. He had little interest in academic studies, and never thought of playing football as a career. He left at sixteen to go into a local laundry where he worked for six months for &pound;2 a week. Out of the blue, so he always said, a letter arrived in February 1936 inviting him for a trial at the north London club Tottenham Hotspur. He had been playing for a local Saturday football team, the Young Liberals, managed by a dentist, and it is presumed that the dentist recommended him to a scout who in turn informed Spurs. His parents had no idea where Tottenham was.<br>
<br>After a month's trial at Spurs Nicholson was taken on as a ground staff boy, again on &pound;2 a week. He was 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighed 10 stone and 12 pounds, and was then playing as an inside forward (he later moved to left back). As he later told Hunter Davies, &#145;I spent most of the summer painting the girders under the stands from eight to five almost every day&#146;. The only training was on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but even then Nicholson and the others had to fit in a day's work beforehand. &#145;I remember we used to play football under the stands, using a piece of old cloth as a ball&#146;  (Davies, 69). After two years, in August 1938, he became a professional player, appearing eight times in the first team before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1939 he joined the Durham light infantry and served for six and a half years, working as an infantry training instructor and then in the Army Physical Training Corps, rising to the rank of sergeant. On 1 March 1942, while home on leave, he married, at St Mary's Church, Tottenham, Grace Lilian Power, a machinist, and daughter of Alfred Thomas Power, secretary. Grace, who was always known as Darkie, was his first and only girlfriend, and lived on Farningham Road, where Nicholson had lived in digs following his arrival from Scarborough.<br>
<br>After the war Nicholson went straight back into the Tottenham first team, playing now as right half. Under the manager Arthur Rowe, who created the famous &#145;push and rush&#146; team of the early 1950s, Spurs won the second division title in 1950 and the first division title in 1951. It was the first time Spurs had won the league championship in their history. As members of the title-winning side Nicholson and Alf Ramsey, the Spurs' full-back, were both known for their consistency, their careful distribution of the ball, and fierce tackling rather than their flair or creativity. Off the pitch Nicholson neither attracted nor courted the limelight. In May 1951 he was picked to play for England against Portugal, managing to score a goal within thirty seconds in what became a 5&#150;2 victory. He never appeared for England again, though he was a reserve on twenty-two occasions. It was unfortunate for him that during most of his career Billy Wright, England's captain, was England's first choice as right half. In all, Nicholson made 341 league and cup appearances for Spurs, before his retirement as a player during the 1954&#150;5 season.<br>
<br>By this time Nicholson had become a qualified coach, having decided not long after his return from the war to take his football coaching badge. The discipline and experience of his army training helped him to pass first time. While still playing for Tottenham he coached the Cambridge University football team, despite the fact that he always believed that football players should not be too smart: &#145;I prefer players not to be too good or clever at other things. It means they concentrate on football&#146;  (Davies, 70). He also coached the England youth team and assisted with the under twenty-three team. On his retirement as a player in 1955 he joined the Spurs coaching staff.<br>
<br>On the morning of Saturday 11 October 1958 it was announced that Jimmy Anderson, the Spurs manager, was resigning, and that Bill Nicholson, his assistant since 1957, was taking over. Nicholson had been informed of this news three days earlier, but had not told anyone, including his wife. The match that day was against Everton. Spurs won 10&#150;4. On his arrival home for his tea his wife still did not know of his appointment. It was only when his mother-in-law arrived and congratulated him, having heard the news on the radio, that Bill finally told Darkie that he had become Tottenham manager. Throughout his career, both as a player and as a manager, Nicholson believed that women had no place in football, not even on the terraces. He refused to let Darkie, or his two daughters, Linda and Jean, ever come to a game in which he was involved.<br>
<br>In 1961 Tottenham won the first division title, making Nicholson one of the few people to have won the championship as both player and manager. In that same season Spurs won the FA cup, thus completing the &#145;double&#146;, the first time this had been achieved since 1897. The FA cup was retained in 1962 and in the following season Spurs won the European cup winners' cup by beating Atl&eacute;tico Madrid 5&#150;1, in a game which is still considered one of the most exciting European finals. It was also the first European trophy to be won by a British club.<br>
<br>As a player Nicholson had been solid, safe, determined. As a man, he was dour, stern, taciturn. He didn't throw things in the dressing room at half time, or scream and shout, but his silences and barely controlled anger could have the same effect. He found it very hard to praise his players, even after a thumping win, and was always quick to point out things that had gone wrong. &#145;In the army, I discovered that it's best to tell people that there's always a bit to go, that they must try harder, they can do better&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Oct 2004). And yet as a manager he built teams that had flair and romance, that exuded excitement and verve, the very opposite of his own dour, negative character. He was a hard taskmaster as a coach, tough on discipline and order, but on the pitch he encouraged creativity. His first great team was built round the flair of Danny Blanchflower and the toughness of Dave Mackay. In 1962 he bought Jimmy Greaves from AC Milan for &pound;99,999&#151;deliberately keeping the transfer fee under &pound;100,000 to minimize the publicity. Nicholson was often at odds with Blanchflower, his captain, who was eloquent, loquacious, and positive, while Nicholson could be gruff and negative. However, they made a good partnership: before the 1963 European final, for example, Nicholson had given a downbeat team talk, extolling all the virtues of the opposition. Blanchflower, sensing their heads going down, then gave a pep talk of his own, praising their talents and strengths.<br>
<br>Under Nicholson, Spurs won another FA cup in 1967 and a second European trophy (the UEFA cup) in 1972, as well as the league cup in 1971 and 1973. In all, during his sixteen years as Spurs manager, he won eight major trophies. Throughout this time he never signed a contract, never once contemplated going anywhere else, and continued to live in the same modest semi-detached house, just ten minutes from the ground, that had been provided for him by the club, though he eventually managed to buy it. His working life was totally devoted to the club. At the wedding of his daughter Linda, his wife, Darkie, noticed that he had tears in his eyes, which surprised her, as he was never known for messy emotions. &#145;I never saw her growing up&#146;, he sobbed as his daughter walked down the aisle  (Davies, 75).<br>
<br>Nicholson announced his retirement as manager in September 1974, with little warning. He felt he had had enough and done enough. He had begun to feel out of touch with modern football, and especially with modern players, whom he found harder to motivate. His own character had been formed by his Yorkshire childhood during the depression and by the war. His language and attitudes harked back to his wartime experiences, which increasingly became a foreign world to younger players. He was upset by the money, fame, and power that modern players seemed to be achieving. The early 1970s also saw a new style of manager, one who sported jewellery and a bouffant hairstyle, and who could put a kindly arm round his players when needed, as well as lambasting and criticizing them.<br>
<br>Following a short spell at West Ham United as a scout Nicholson returned to Spurs in 1976, on the scouting side, and as a consultant. In 1975 he was appointed OBE and in 1998 received the freedom of the borough of Haringey. In 1991 he was appointed club president and eight years later the little road off Tottenham High Road that leads to the main entrance to the club was renamed Bill Nicholson Way. Bill Nicholson was Spurs' most successful manager and also one of England's greatest post-war managers, along with Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, and Alf Ramsey. He died of prostate cancer at Potters Bar Community Hospital, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, on 23 October 2004; he was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
