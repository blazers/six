<span class="headword">Ransome family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1785&#150;1875), <span class="occ">agricultural machinery manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_23139"></a><span class="headword">Robert Ransome</span>  (1753&#150;1830)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Wells, Norfolk, son of Richard Ransome, a schoolmaster there. His grandfather, Richard Ransome, was a miller of North Walsham, Norfolk, and an early Quaker, who suffered frequent imprisonment while on preaching journeys in various parts of England, Ireland, and the Low Countries. He died at Bristol on 8 November 1716. On leaving school Robert Ransome was apprenticed to an ironmonger, and he commenced business for himself at Norwich with a small brass foundry. Shortly afterwards he added iron founding. He married Mary Raven in 1782, and they had two sons.<br>
<br>Ransome possessed inventive skill, and as early as 1783 he took out a patent for cast-iron roofing plates, and published <span class="italic">Directions for Laying Ransome's Patent Cast-Iron coverings</span>, printed for the patentees in 1784. On 18 March 1785 he took out his first patent for tempering cast-iron ploughshares by wetting the mould with salt water. In 1803 he was responsible for one of the most important developments ever made in the manufacture of ploughs. This was the chilling process, whereby the underside of the share was made extra hard, while the upper part remained soft and tough. The upper part thus wore away faster than the lower, so that a sharp cutting edge was maintained and less draught was required. By the use of these shares, the continual laying and sharpening of wrought-iron shares was avoided. This invention was at once adopted and was not superseded. In 1808 Ransome took out a further patent for the manufacture of interchangeable plough parts. This development enabled him to offer farmers easier maintenance and replacement of worn parts, and to achieve a measure of standardization.<br>
<br>In 1789 Ransome moved to Ipswich, establishing there the business that became successful in manufacturing a wide range of agricultural and industrial implements. Ransome was joined in business by his two sons, and the firm traded as Ransome &amp; Sons from 1818. During the period after the Napoleonic wars, as well as manufacturing ploughs the firm undertook general iron-founding and engineering work. William Cubitt was engineer to the business from 1812 to 1826, and he made the firm a pioneer in the construction of cast-iron bridges, the most notable of which was Stoke Bridge, Ipswich, built in 1818.<br>
<br>Upon retiring from business in 1825, Ransome learned copperplate-engraving as an amusement, and constructed a telescope for his own use, for which he ground the speculum himself. The later years of his life were spent at Woodbridge in Suffolk, where he died on 7 March 1830.<br>
<br>Robert Ransome's elder son, <a name="cosubject_23137"></a><span class="headword">James Ransome</span>  (1782&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span>, entered his father's business in 1795. With his brother Robert he took out several patents for improvements in ploughs. Threshing machines, scarifiers, and other agricultural implements were also improved by his firm. The brothers were among the earliest members of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which was founded in 1838, and they gained in later years many of the society's chief medals and prizes. From the 1830s to the 1860s Ransomes also became leading manufacturers of railway equipment, especially of chairs and fastenings, and of chilled-iron crossings. Patents were taken out covering the manufacture of each of these. James Ransome died at Rushmere, near Ipswich, on 22 November 1849, his wife Hannah, daughter of Samuel Hunton of Southwold, having predeceased him on 8 December 1826. They had a large family.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_23138"></a><span class="headword">James Allen Ransome</span>  (1806&#150;1875)<span class="occ"></span>, born in July 1806, was, after being educated at Colchester, apprenticed to the firm of Ransome &amp; Sons; he became a partner in 1829, the firm then taking the style J. R. and A. Ransome. Between 1826 and 1829, and again from 1833 to 1839, he resided at Yoxford, Suffolk, where a branch of the business was established. He started a farmers' club there which was the precursor of many similar institutions, notably the London Farmers' Club, of which Ransome was one of the founders. In 1839 he moved permanently to Ipswich, and under his direction the business assumed huge proportions. In 1843 he published <span class="italic">The Implements of Agriculture</span>, part of which had been prepared as a prize essay for the Royal Agricultural Society of England. This was the most important book on its subject published in the mid-nineteenth century. Ransome had joined the Royal Agricultural Society in 1838, served two terms on its council (1844&#150;6 and 1855&#150;7), and was one of the most popular figures at its annual shows. He was an alderman of Ipswich from 1865 until his death. He married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 17 April 1868), daughter of James Neave of Fordingbridge, Hampshire, on 4 September 1829; and they had two sons, Robert James and Allen Ransome, and three daughters, one of whom married J. R. Jefferies, an active member of the firm. James Allen Ransome died at his house in Carr Street, Ipswich, on 29 April 1875.<br>
<br>The small brass foundry established by the elder Robert Ransome in the latter half of the eighteenth century had, by the 1850s, become one of Britain's leading agricultural engineering firms, employing more than 1000 workers. From producing and sharpening ploughs and other agricultural implements, the firm had diversified widely, especially into railway equipment. It was one of the first companies to build cast-iron bridges and later it also became renowned for its lawnmowers, when it was under the direction of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48140/', "Robert Charles Ransome")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48139/', "James Edward Ransome")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48140/', "Ransome, Robert Charles")</script>]. Members of the family retained their Quaker affiliation, and were active civic and philanthropic figures in Ipswich, where their works were based.<br>
