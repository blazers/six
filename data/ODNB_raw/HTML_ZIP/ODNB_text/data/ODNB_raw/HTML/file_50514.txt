<span class="headword">Pinney,  John Pretor</span>  (1740&#150;1818), <span class="occ">merchant and planter</span>, was born at Chard, Somerset, on 18 September 1740, the second of the two children of Michael Pretor (<i>d</i>. 1744), a gentleman, of Okehampton, Devon, and his wife, Alicia Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1759). At the age of fifteen he passed into the guardianship of his cousins Azariah and John Frederick Pinney at Bettiscombe, Dorset, and was apprenticed to a warehouseman in London until 1763. John Frederick Pinney, who had no living children, died around that time and left his property in England and Nevis to Pretor on the condition that he and his heirs assumed the name of Pinney. The properties on Nevis, the smallest of the British Caribbean sugar islands, consisted of slave-based sugar plantations acquired by John Pretor Pinney's great-great-uncle Azariah towards the end of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Pinney set out for Nevis in 1764 to manage the estates he had inherited. He was notably successful as resident proprietor there: he settled two sugar estates, Cresseys and Choppins, in Gingerland parish; improved his lowland plantation, consisting of Charlots and Mountravers, which he worked as a single estate of 273 acres; and in the 1770s bought Woodland or Cole's plantation (120 acres). Such was his success that he improved his fortune by at least &pound;35,000 in the twenty years after 1764. On 14 June 1772, in Nevis, he married a white Creole, Jane Weekes (<i>d</i>. 18 May 1821), with whom he had seven children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22303/', "Charles Pinney")</script>, later mayor of Bristol. He took an active part in public life, being elected to the Nevis assembly in 1765 and gaining a seat on the council in 1767; he was also a JP and colonel of the regiment of foot in the militia.<br>
<br>Like many English adventurers in the Caribbean, Pinney regarded England as his real home and wanted his children educated there. While retaining his plantations, he left Nevis in 1783 with his younger children&#151;his wife and older children having already returned to England&#151;and became a West India merchant at Bristol and a landowner in Dorset. He had already accumulated a substantial amount of money. In 1784 he held bank annuity stock worth a nominal value of &pound;10,000, a navy bill valued at &pound;1080, twelve India bonds worth &pound;1200, and nearly &pound;70,000 lent on the security of English lands. Although he made several brief return trips to Nevis, he lived for the rest of his life at Bristol, Racedown in Dorset, and Somerton Erleigh in Somerset. William and Dorothy Wordsworth were tenants of Racedown Lodge from 1795 to 1797. &#145;My greatest pride&#146;, he once remarked, &#145;is to be considered as a private Country Gentleman therefore am resolved to content myself with a little and shall avoid even the name of a West Indian&#146;  (MacInnes, <span class="italic">A Gateway of Empire</span>, 325).<br>
<br>Pinney formed a West India commission house in Bristol in 1783 in partnership with James Tobin. This firm lasted until 1850 with many changes of partners. It was a fairly small concern, with an original capital of &pound;12,000 and ownership of only two or three ships at any one time, and traded largely with St Kitts and Nevis&#151;refusing Jamaica connections presumably because these were already well established at Bristol. The firm's business was conducted from 7 Great George Street. These premises, which were completed in 1790, have been preserved under the auspices of the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery as a typical example of a Georgian merchant's counting and dwelling house.<br>
<br>Pinney rarely participated in political life in Bristol, though he was a member of the common council in 1796. Nor did he belong to the prestigious Society of Merchant Venturers, but in 1786 he joined the Bristol West India Society, a recently created group of the most influential businessmen in the city with Caribbean connections. This society lobbied against the abolition of the slave trade and slave emancipation. Pinney agreed with their views to begin with, but by 1805 he had changed his mind; he then regarded the abolition of the slave trade with equanimity because it would not harm well-established West Indian estates and would check new settlements that might compete with his own. Yet when the <span class="roman">Slave Registration Bill</span> was discussed in parliament in the years 1812&#150;17 Pinney thought it would tamper with slavery and ruin the sugar economy of the Caribbean.<br>
<br>Pinney had greater difficulty in controlling his plantations after he returned to Bristol than when he had lived in Nevis, which was to be expected. But he kept a tight rein on their management even from a distance, paying meticulous attention to his accounts. He sold Mountravers estate in 1808. Wealth accrued to him from plantations, sugar commission sales, shipping profits, and, above all, interest earned on money lent to other planters. Pinney died at 7 Great George Street on 23 January 1818, and was buried in the family vault at Somerton Erleigh church. Richard Pares estimates that Pinney was worth &pound;267,000 on paper at the time of his death (excluding money planters owed him on mortgage and the value of ships and current account of his mercantile firm). This was the peak of the Pinneys' West India fortune, which totalled around &pound;340,000 by 1818. The family connection with Nevis continued for a couple of generations more, but Pinney's sons were less successful as businessmen.<br>
