<span class="headword">Smith,  Thomas</span>  (1547&#150;1573), <span class="occ">colonial adventurer</span>, was born on 15 March 1547, probably at Cambridge, the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25906/', "Sir Thomas Smith (1513&#150;1577)")</script>, the influential Tudor intellectual and courtier. Sir Thomas expected much of his only child and heir and dictated the course of his life. The awesome shadow cast by his indefatigable father obscures his early years. Thomas is known only to have accompanied him on his French embassies, and to have served as an officer in Ireland about 1568 before entering into the service of the earl of Leicester. His career began in earnest following his father's plan for a private colonial venture in the north of Ireland in the summer of 1571.<br>
<br>In November 1571 Sir Thomas and his son received a substantial grant of land in the Ards, co. Down, and Upper Clandeboye, co. Antrim. Sir Thomas, then a privy councillor, secured this grant by offering independently to recruit colonists and privately fund the expedition. This was accomplished by the publication and distribution of a broadsheet and book appealing for subscriptions and volunteers. Sir Thomas was undoubtedly the ideological force behind both works, although they were attributed to his son. The intention of father and son was to expropriate the Gaelic clansmen in the area, thus liberating the allegedly tractable Gaelic churl who would remain to till the land. They supposed that the clansmen were the disruptive element in local society, whereas the peaceful, hard-working churl would acquiesce in English law and custom. These publications reached Ireland and provoked resentment from Sir Brian O'Neill of Clandeboye, the Anglophile chieftain whose lands had been granted to the Smiths. The administration at Dublin was less than enthusiastic about the plan and feared that outside intervention would cause a general rebellion in the north. The unexpected dispatch of Sir Thomas to France in December 1571 left the controversial and well-publicized enterprise in the untested hands of his son.<br>
<br>Early in 1572 Smith began gathering volunteers at Liverpool, although his undisciplined handling of them soon caused the mayor to complain of their unruly behaviour. Smith further exacerbated the problems of the already troubled undertaking by tampering with the proposed structure of the colony. He attempted to sell to his friends thirty &#145;assistantships&#146; allowing them wide powers in the colony. Sir Thomas disagreed with his son's changes and suspended the matter until his return. Smith had no recourse but to borrow money from both his father and London in order to keep the enterprise afloat. Sir Thomas rebuked his son for believing he had &#145;a bottomless purse or a mine to spend at his pleasure&#146;  (Dewar, 162). His return in July saved the enterprise from dissolution and his influence at court at last secured permission for the expedition to embark. The delays over the winter, however, had taken their toll and Thomas Smith set sail for Ireland on 30 August 1572 with but 100 of the 800 men he had gathered.<br>
<br>Smith arrived in Ireland the following day to a cold reception. Fitzwilliam, the lord deputy, offered little assistance. He had not been consulted about the enterprise and did not favour the establishment of a virtually autonomous colony in Ireland. Penniless, Smith was forced to borrow wheat from Fitzwilliam and &pound;100 from Lady Fitzwilliam. Two successive grants in late September, according the Smiths substantial powers, did not improve the situation. Smith sought a meeting with O'Neill, who had been most vocal in his opposition to the prospective colony. O'Neill declined and flatly refused to surrender any land to the brash outsider. Smith reluctantly travelled to Dublin to seek the advice of Fitzwilliam, who convinced Smith to allow the winter to pass before any further provocative movements were made. In October O'Neill, supported by rival Gaelic chieftains who also feared expropriation, ravaged the Ards. Irish hostility then ceased for the winter and O'Neill appeared receptive to negotiation. This, however, was a common tactic employed to frustrate and confuse the enemy. Smith, unlearned in Gaelic warfare, looked confidently toward the spring. Sir Thomas did not share his son's confidence and dispatched 250 soldiers in March. But the reinforcements never reached Ireland and Smith was left unaided.<br>
<br>Smith enjoyed some success in early 1573, attacking O'Neill and negotiating the submission of the MacDonald chief. Fitzwilliam, fearing an Irish confederation, reluctantly granted him command of the Newry garrison to facilitate his offensive. His fears were confirmed when O'Neill burnt Carrickfergus in May. It was clear to all, including Smith, that the colony would not survive without reinforcements. He appealed for assistance but none was forthcoming. Following the mutiny of some of his soldiers, Smith wrote that &#145;envy hath hindered more than the enemy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/40/75). His authority was further diminished by the dispatch of the earl of Essex to salvage Smith's enterprise and establish colonies in those lands where Smith had failed. Smith, however, could not be saved from the bitter enmity his expedition had caused. On 20 October 1573 an Irishman in his employ killed him with a gunshot at Comber in the Ards. What was to have been an exemplary venture ended in utter failure. The hapless Thomas Smith was at once the victim of his father's innovative but untested colonial ideas and his own ignorance of Irish affairs. His death shocked the Elizabethan court and moved a poet to compose &#145;The Tumulus of Thomas Smith Killed in Ireland&#146;.<br>
