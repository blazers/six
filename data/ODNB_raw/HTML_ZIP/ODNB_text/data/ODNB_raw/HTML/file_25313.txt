<span class="headword">Shelley, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1513&#150;1587), <span class="occ">diplomat and prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, was the second son of the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25315/', "Sir William Shelley (1478/9&#150;1549)")</script> and Alice Belknap (<i>d</i>. 1536), both of Sussex. Richard Shelley followed others of his family by joining the knights of St John (the hospitallers, or knights of Malta). In the mid-1530s he went to the continent to round off his education, and in 1539, wearied of study, took his first steps on a diplomatic career, accompanying the Venetian ambassador on a mission to the Turkish court in the hope of gaining firsthand knowledge to employ in Henry VIII's service. The expedition to Turkey was arduous, but the experience does seem to have helped equip him for his chosen career, and by at least January 1541, though he had protested against Henry VIII's suppression of the hospitallers in England in 1540, he was a recognized member of the diplomatic corps, receiving expenses in 1546 as a member of the English mission in France.<br>
<br>Shelley was now acquiring a reputation as a suave diplomat and able linguist, so much so that in October 1550 he was mentioned as a possible special commissioner to unblock deadlocked negotiations with the French over the boundaries of the recent English conquest at Boulogne. At some point Henry VIII seems to have employed him in Germany. In November 1551 he was chosen for the special task of escorting Mary of Guise, the widow of the Scottish king James V, through the English part of a journey from France to Scotland. In March the following year, &#145;an honest gentleman &hellip; who speaks several languages&#146;, though reputed to be &#145;of the new religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, 1550&#150;52, 468, 494), Shelley was selected as ambassador at the court of the emperor Charles V, and in January 1554 he reported his interview in Vienna with Charles's brother, Ferdinand, king of the Romans, in which, shown signal marks of favour, he discussed Anglo-Habsburg friendship and royal marriage proposals.<br>
<br>Accomplished diplomat though he clearly was, Shelley must have needed to summon up all his skills as an emissary in July 1553, when he had to reassure Charles V, always highly protective of his family's welfare, of the safety of the emperor's cousin, Mary Tudor, briefly set aside in the succession to the throne by the accession of Lady Jane Grey. Following Mary's seizure of the throne in August, Shelley faced, in January 1554, the doubtless more agreeable task of formally announcing to the emperor the marriage to Charles's son Philip of &#145;the Queen, his mistress&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, 1553, 479). His role as a courtier-diplomat was fully evident late in 1555 when, as a gentleman of the household who in April had been granted an annual income of &pound;50 for life, he was deputed to convey formally to the Portuguese royal family and the regent of Spain the news of the queen's confinement, paying his respects to the king of France <i>en route</i>.<br>
<br>In point of fact Shelley's ambassadorial career, clearly blossoming up to this point, was interrupted when Mary restored to him his membership of the knights of St John by re-establishing the hospitallers in England in April 1557. He was appointed turcopolier, or commander of the light infantry of the knights, a post traditionally reserved to Englishmen, and made commander of the preceptory (or religious house) of Slebech (Pembrokeshire) and Halston (Shropshire). Following Mary's death in November 1558 and her succession by the protestant Elizabeth, Shelley, who was on his way to Malta, the knights' headquarters, adopted an unmistakably Catholic stance. Though there was a possibility of his resuming his diplomatic career under Elizabeth, in the 1560s his fortunes became caught up with those of the knights, and in September 1561 he succeeded Thomas Tresham as grand prior. Now an exile in the world of Catholic Europe, Shelley, if he was to return to work as an envoy, would do so under the aegis of Philip II of Spain, who sent him on a mission to congratulate the new king of the Romans in 1562. It was from Madrid that Shelley wrote, in June 1565, to the secretary of state, William Cecil, advising the adoption of a moderate course in religion in England, giving notice of his own imminent departure for Malta, hoping to resume his services for his country, but otherwise resigning himself to a Catholic retirement with his &#145;Book &amp; Beads&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of the Harleian Manuscripts in the British Museum</span>, 2.465, no. 6990, 31). His intention in July 1565 of playing his part in opposing the great, but ultimately unsuccessful, Turkish siege of Malta was stalled at Naples, though Shelley did eventually reach the island, even if disputes with the grand master led to his withdrawal at the end of the 1560s.<br>
<br>The final phase of Shelley's life now opened, in Venice, at the invitation of the government of that republic. There, in April 1574, he was noted by Philip Sidney as &#145;very much devoted to papist superstitions&#146;  (Pears, <span class="italic">Correspondence of Sir Philip Sidney</span>, 50). In July of the same year, though ill, he journeyed on to Prague and Hamburg, but by June 1575 he was evidently back in Venice. From there a long series of letters home, written in the 1570s and 1580s to the queen and to the secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham, shows that he acted as a semi-official, unpaid, commercial representative of English merchants' fiscal concerns. In this correspondence he vehemently protested both his loyalty to the queen (involving the refusal of a Spanish pension), and his unbudging Catholicism: in February 1576 he was in Rome, where he was identified as opposed to the militant Catholic strategy of Cardinal William Allen. Shelley grew increasingly desperate to return home and begged Walsingham to allow him to do so, to live as a private Catholic. He was hated by the &eacute;migr&eacute; Catholic militants and strongly opposed the Jesuits. Memoranda of April 1582 and May 1583 reported him to be in the hands of the Inquisition, perhaps because of his political views, and he was also summoned to Rome in 1586 but refused to go&#151;though he was referred to in July 1587 as a possible cardinal. Dark references in his correspondence to matters of national security that could not be broached in open letters strongly suggest that he was supplying Walsingham with information on Catholic subversives on the continent&#151;&#145;I have a meaning (and very good means) to discredit some&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 19.182)&#151;but the involvement in 1584 in the alleged treason of his recusant nephew Richard Shelley, on whose behalf he bravely petitioned the queen and Walsingham, must have put paid to any expectations that such services as he provided might be rewarded with a passport home. Sick and poor, heavily in debt, and begging for the payment of the arrears of his salary granted in happier days by Mary, Shelley gave final expression to the strength of conviction of his dual position&#151;&#145;a Catholic, yet in his heart &hellip; a most dutiful subject&#146;  (Stern, 76)&#151;by dying, probably of apoplexy, about 12 September 1587, following a heated dispute with Jesuits in Venice over their &#145;justifying of the English traitors executed in England&#146;  (Read, 3.282). The knights of St John quickly buried him, next day in Venice, and seized what property he had possessed.<br>
