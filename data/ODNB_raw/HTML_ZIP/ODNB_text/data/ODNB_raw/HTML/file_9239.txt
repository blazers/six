<span class="headword">Fearne,  Charles</span>  (1742<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1794), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born in London, the eldest child of Charles Fearne (<i>d</i>. 1768), deputy secretary of the Admiralty and judge-advocate of the fleet, who presided at the trial of Admiral John Byng from December 1756 to January 1757. He was educated initially by his father, and then at Westminster School. When he left Westminster, his father persuaded him to enter the Inner Temple, although he was not sure that he wanted to practise law. His father died in 1768, leaving a small inheritance to be divided equally between his two sons and daughter. Fearne refused to take his share on the grounds that he had already received a few hundred pounds to start him in his profession and that he had received a superior education to that of his brother.<br>
<br>Fearne had a remarkably inventive mind, which prevented him from devoting himself single-mindedly to law. Charles Butler described him as &#145;a general scholar &hellip; profoundly versed in maths, chemistry and mechanics. He had obtained a patent for dyeing scarlet and had solicited one for a preparation of porcelain&#146;  (Butler, &#145;Preface&#146;). To finance a project to produce morocco leather, he sold some of his library; but the venture proved too expensive and had to be abandoned. Butler relates that a friend who mentioned to:<blockquote>an eminent gunsmith a project of a musket of greater power and much less size than that in ordinary use, the gunsmith pointed out to him its defects and observed that a &#145;Mr. Fearne, an obscure law man in Breame's-buildings, Chancery Lane, had invented a musket, which, although defective, was much nearer to the attainment of the object&#146;. (Butler, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.118)</blockquote>Fearne was also a classical scholar. &#145;He composed a treatise in the Greek language on the <span class="italic">Greek Accents</span>, and another on the <span class="italic">Retreat of the Ten Thousand</span>&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>When Fearne &#145;resolved to dedicate himself to the study of law, he burned his profane library and wept over its flames&#146;  (Butler, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1.126&#150;7); works which he most regretted included the comedies of Aristophanes. His first legal publication was a <span class="italic">Historical and Legigraphical Chart of Landed Property in England</span> (1769). He soon acquired a considerable chamber practice, and his <span class="italic">Essay on the Learning of Contingent Remainders and Executory Devises</span>, published in 1772, ensured his place among the leading property lawyers and remains the classical text on this arcane subject. Fearne's text is both logical and comprehensive for he had assimilated the old common-law learning which he revered. Nowhere is this more evident than in his defence of the rule in <i>Shelley's case</i> (1579), which stated that if land was devised to John &#145;for life with remainder to his heirs&#146;, these words should be construed to grant John a fee simple, the largest estate known to English law, which enabled him to alienate the land, thereby defeating the expectation of his heirs. The lord chief justice, William Murray, Lord Mansfield, a most distinguished commercial lawyer, disliked the rule. In <i>Perrin v. Blake</i> (1770) he held that the rule was not a rule of law but of construction, and it should not be followed if it was necessary to give effect to the settlor's intention that John should only enjoy a life estate. Although his decision was reversed by the court of exchequer chamber (1772), the controversy over whether Mansfield's view should prevail continued. Mansfield's &#145;heresy&#146; may well have led Fearne to write the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, in which he vigorously defended the &#145;old learning&#146; in <i>Shelley</i>. The <span class="italic">Essay</span> satirized Mansfield's judicial style, depicting his ruling that precedents were to be discarded as out of keeping with the superior talents of the times. He also asserted that Mansfield, when solicitor-general, had given an opinion in 1747 in which he concluded that John took a fee simple estate. Mansfield's denial that he had ever given such an opinion led to Fearne's indignant <span class="italic">Letter</span> to him, in which Fearne set out the case on which Mansfield's opinion was based. The rule in <i>Shelley</i> survived until the <span class="roman">Law of Property Act</span> (1925) effectively abolished it.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> sealed Fearne's professional reputation. It went through ten editions to 1844, and received an American edition in 1819. He was said to have been &#145;more consulted than any man of his time&#146;  (1 Cl. &amp; Finn. 399). But other interests continued to distract him. To pursue them, he bought a cottage in Hampstead where he enjoyed doing mechanical and philosophical experiments. He remained out of London for longer and longer periods, often taking family and friends on sailing or fishing expeditions, leaving directions with his clerk &#145;not to know where his master was&#151;how he was&#151;or when he would be in town&#146;  (Cunningham). Inevitably his clients dropped away. He had made a large income, but he had lived so extravagantly that he had to accept his friends' financial assistance. To restore his fortunes, he returned to practice. But both financial adversity and the loss of his independence crushed his mind and body. Fearne retired, and died either in the neighbourhood of Croydon, Surrey, on 21 January 1794, &#145;at the premature age of forty-five&#146;  (ibid.), or at Chelmsford, Essex, on 25 February 1794, &#145;in the 52d year of his age&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 182), after a lingering illness. He was survived by his wife, about whom little is known; in 1797 <span class="italic">The Posthumous Works of Charles Fearne</span> were published for her benefit, edited by Thomas Mitchell Shadwell, a former ward of Fearne. The twelve-page list of subscribers was headed by Lord Chief Justice Kenyon and Sir Richard Pepper Arden, master of the rolls, an indication of the respect Fearne commanded.<br>
