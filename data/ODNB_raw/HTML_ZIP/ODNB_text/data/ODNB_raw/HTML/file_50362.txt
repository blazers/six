<span class="headword">Thorne, Sir  (Augustus Francis) Andrew Nicol</span>  (1885&#150;1970), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 20 September 1885 at Dornhurst, Sevenoaks, Kent, son of Augustus Thorne (1825&#150;1901), businessman and farmer, and his second wife, Mary Nicol (1857&#150;1924). Having been educated at Mulgrave Castle School, Whitby (1894&#150;9), Eton College (1899&#150;1902), and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1903&#150;4), he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards in 1904. He married Margaret Douglas-Pennant (1886&#150;1967), tenth daughter of the second Baron Penrhyn, on 29 July 1909. It was a strong and happy marriage and they had five children.<br>
<br>Thorne, a staff captain with 1st guards brigade, who was nicknamed Bulgy, landed in France in August 1914. The brigade was heavily involved in the first battle of Ypres in October&#150;November 1914, particularly around the village of Gheluvelt where Thorne had his horse shot from under him. After twelve months on the staff he was appointed second in command of the 1st battalion Grenadier Guards in March 1916. He commanded the 3rd battalion from September 1916 through the Somme, Passchendaele, Cambrai, and the retreat in the wake of Ludendorff's offensive of 1918. A leader with great energy and courage, he inspired his men with confidence which may in part have been due to his apparent invulnerability. Thorne's most serious injury of the war was sustained while playing football. He was made DSO three times and was mentioned in dispatches on seven occasions. In October 1918 Thorne assumed command of 184th infantry brigade with the temporary rank of brigadier-general.<br>
<br>Thorne was unsure whether he wanted to remain in the post-war army and chose to become a CMG in 1919 rather than accept a brevet. He went to Washington as assistant military attach&eacute;, where he decided to stay in the service. He attended Staff College, Camberley, from 1921 to 1922, and after returning a year later became an instructor there (1923&#150;5). Following a brief period as military assistant to the chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), Lord Cavan, he returned with some relief to regimental soldiering to command the 3rd battalion Grenadier Guards. He attended the Imperial Defence College in 1931. As military attach&eacute; in Berlin from 1932 to 1935 Thorne, on several occasions, met Hitler, who always discussed the fighting around Gheluvelt in 1914 where Hitler too had served. Indeed a translation of Thorne's 1932 article in the <span class="italic">Household Brigade Magazine</span> about Gheluvelt was found in the wreckage of Hitler's bunker in 1945. Thorne returned to Britain to command the 1st guards brigade in 1935 and saw active service in Palestine in 1936. He was made major-general and general officer commanding London district, in 1938.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War Thorne received command of the 48th (south midland) territorial division, which arrived in France in January 1940. The standard of equipment and training of the British expeditionary force's (BEF) territorial divisions was low. Thorne's efforts to rectify the situation before the Germans attacked in May 1940 were rewarded as his division performed creditably in the retreat from the Dyle and their desperate defence of the western perimeter of Dunkirk was vital to the safe withdrawal of the BEF. Back in England, Thorne took command of 12th corps in June 1940 with responsibility for the defence of the vital Sussex&#150;Kent coastline, the likely site of a German invasion attempt. Thorne put his customary energy into his preparations and the training of his men. On 7 May 1941 Thorne was promoted lieutenant-general and made general officer commanding-in-chief, Scottish command. This was the turning point of Thorne's career. Scotland, though an army command, was peripheral to the war, whereas 12th corps had been in the front line. The decision to move Thorne was made by General Alan Brooke, then commander-in-chief, home forces, who appears to have regarded it as an advancement. Yet it left Thorne sidelined, ensuring he was never again seriously considered for active command. He was made KCB in 1942.<br>
<br>None the less Thorne approached Scottish command's work with his usual vigour. Scotland was the obvious springboard for any operations launched against German-occupied Norway. While no such operations were undertaken, Thorne was responsible for the large scale deception scheme, Fortitude North, which ensured that the twelve German divisions in Norway stayed there throughout the Normandy landings. He was promoted full general in February 1945. Following careful planning for the liberation it says much for his abilities that as commander-in-chief, allied land forces, Norway, Thorne was able to take the surrender of 400,000 Germans in May 1945 and smoothly hand power back to the Norwegian authorities.<br>
<br>Thorne retired in May 1946. In 1950 the Norwegian government asked the War Office to help restructure the Norwegian army. Thorne accepted this task with alacrity. The Norwegians implemented the majority of his recommendations. With justice Thorne can be considered the father of the modern Norwegian army. In his retirement Sir Andrew Thorne enjoyed family life, maintained close links with Norway, and worked on his golf. He died in Spynie Hospital, Elgin, on 25 September 1970, following a heart attack. He was buried in Sonning-on-Thames, Berkshire, on 1 October.<br>
