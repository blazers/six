<span class="headword">Cannan,  Gilbert Eric</span>  (1884&#150;1955), <span class="occ">translator and writer</span>, was born on 25 June 1884 at 24 Great Cheetham Street West, in Broughton, Manchester. One of nine children, he was the second son of Henry Angus Cannan, an ill-paid Scottish shipping clerk, and (Grace Charlotte) Violet, the daughter of the Revd Francis Arbuthnot Wright, an Anglican clergyman whose enthusiasms and hospitality did not match his income. Cannan's parents were loving, but feckless, and as a child Cannan wondered sometimes whether he was a changeling. Overshadowed by Angus, his tough-minded and clever elder brother, he was given to long bouts of crying, which were probably the first symptoms of the insanity which was eventually to cast a cloud over his life. Cannan attended Ducie Avenue board school from where, to his parents' surprise, he won a foundation scholarship to Manchester grammar school in 1898. Here he quickly made his mark in modern languages, winning prizes every year until he left in 1902, with an open modern languages exhibition to King's College, Cambridge, partly on the strength of a brilliant essay on Schiller. At Cambridge he was noted for an aloofness, which may have masked a sense of insecurity. He read voraciously in German, French, and English, made no close friends, and left with a formidable knowledge of European culture, but only a pass degree, which suggests either a breakdown in health, or a failure to adhere to the prescribed texts.<br>
<br>After university Cannan read for the bar, but later abandoned the law in order to write. He was tall and fair with an emperor's nose, and also quickly gained a foothold in literary and theatrical circles. Following a passionate but unconsummated love affair with Kathleen Bruce, who married Robert Scott, the explorer, Cannan became involved with Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ansell (1868/9&#150;1950), James Barrie's wife, while working as secretary of the Society for the Abolition of Censorship. In 1909 he was cited as the co-respondent in the divorce which ensued and, against the advice of H. G. Wells and others, married her out of a sense of chivalry on 28 April 1910.<br>
<br>Cannan started his translation of Romain Rolland's four-volume masterpiece, <span class="italic">Jean Christophe</span>, in 1907. His own first novel, <span class="italic">Peter Homunculus</span> (1909), was published in the year he became a theatre critic and, from that time on, novels, reviews, sociological and philosophical books, short plays, poems, and translations poured from Cannan's pen. In 1913 he reached a wider public with <span class="italic">Round the Corner</span>, a novel based on the life of his maternal grandfather and family, whose perverse and flamboyant lifestyle gave Cannan ample scope for a dense and deeply felt story. Other novels draw on the lives of his paternal forebears and relatives: <span class="italic">Little Brother</span> (1912) cruelly depicts <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32278/', "Edwin Cannan (1861&#150;1935)")</script>, the economist, who supported Cannan financially until his marriage, and in <span class="italic">The Stucco House</span> (1917) is a vivid portrait of Cannan's grandfather, James Cannan, a provincial journalist, bank clerk, and theatre critic for the <span class="italic">Manchester News</span>. At twenty-five, Cannan declared, he had a very clear conception of the industrial revolution seen through the spiritual history of his family.<br>
<br>In 1913 the Cannans moved to a converted windmill in Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire, where they entertained writers and artists, including D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, David Garnett, and Compton Mackenzie. They were also taken up by Ottoline Morrell. Mark Gertler used the mill's garage as a studio; Vladimir Polunin decorated Cannan's study with a frieze; and S. S. Koteliansky worked with him on translations from the Russian. In 1916 Cannan's novel <span class="italic">Mendel</span>, based on the life of Mark Gertler, caused outrage. His marriage broke up; he fled to London, and, living alone in shabby rooms, became increasingly unstable, but continued to write and translate.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1918 Mary Cannan was granted a judicial separation after Cannan fell in love with a radiant nineteen-year-old South African, Gwen Wilson, an affair which probably postponed his final breakdown. The couple rented a studio in St John's Wood, London, and took as a lodger Henry Mond, later Lord Melchett. This arrangement subsequently resulted in a <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> which became a talking point in literary London. In 1920, while Cannan was lecturing in North America and raising money for D. H. Lawrence, Mond married Gwen Wilson, a blow from which Cannan never recovered. Desolate, he travelled across Africa, mostly by horse, sending back dispatches to the <span class="italic">New York Freeman</span>, which were published in a book, <span class="italic">Letters from a Distance</span> (1923). On his return, homeless and alone but still writing, he descended into violent madness. Certified insane in April 1924, Cannan became a patient in The Priory, Roehampton, London, where he wrote paranoic letters destined for the dustbin. His translation of <span class="italic">A. O. Barnabooth: his Diary</span> came out to good reviews that autumn.<br>
<br>In fifteen hectic years Cannan wrote twenty-seven books, countless articles, scores of poems, and at least fourteen one- and two-act plays, of which the best-known were <span class="italic">Everybody's Husband</span> (1917) and <span class="italic">Miles Dixon</span>, which the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> critic likened to the work of Synge. In 1913 Henry James had described Cannan as one of four up-and-coming authors, with D. H. Lawrence &#145;in the dusty rear&#146;  (Farr, 116). St John Hankin remarked that &#145;Shaw, Barker and Galsworthy all believe Cannan is going to wipe them out&#146;  (ibid., 88). Such praise caused resentment. Lawrence in a furious moment called Cannan a &#145;soap pill&#146;  (J. Boulton, ed., <span class="italic">The Letters of D. H. Lawrence</span>, 7 vols., 1979&#150;93) and Lytton Strachey described him as &#145;an empty bucket&#146;  (Farr, 65). Yet few knew his fate, for only Gwen Melchett and, later, Edwin Cannan's widow, Rita, were allowed to visit him at The Priory.<br>
<br>In 1952 Cannan was moved to a freer regime at Holloway Sanatorium, Virginia Water, Surrey, where he died of cancer on 30 June 1955, leaving one possession, a barrister's moth-eaten wig. He was cremated in Woking.<br>
