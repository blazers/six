<span class="headword">Davis,  Thomas</span>  (1749&#150;1807), <span class="occ">estate steward and agriculturist</span>, was born on 11 July 1749 at Penton Mewsey, Hampshire, son of Thomas Davis, an itinerant excise officer then based there, and his wife, Elizabeth. Davis received a good classical education at a school in Devizes, Wiltshire, and in December 1763 he was taken into the estates offices of Thomas Thynne, third Viscount Weymouth, later first marquess of Bath. These were in the west front of Longleat House, Warminster, under the chief steward, Simon Jude Cole (1703&#150;1787). On 9 June 1772 Davis married Mary Coombs (1744&#150;1814) at Longbridge Deverill. They had six surviving children, three sons and three daughters. In 1777 Cole was superannuated and moved to nearby Horningsham. Davis took over his apartments and offices at Longleat, after fourteen years as Cole's assistant, and became chief steward to the first and second marquesses, serving their houses in Wiltshire and London and their extensive estates in England and Ireland. Davis's salary was an annual &pound;100, which was considerably supplemented by receipts from the sale of timber, from lands he leased nearby, and from his other occupations. He proved a wonderful manager, having in 1787 improved accountability by introducing separate household and land accounts. In November 1796, after the death of the first marquess of Bath, Davis moved from Longleat House into offices in Horningsham.<br>
<br>Davis also started a notable career as an agriculturist. He had joined the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society by 1782, and started contributing to their published <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span> from volume 3 (published 1786). In 1793 he was asked by the board of agriculture to contribute the volume on Wiltshire to their series of county agricultural reports. This was one of the first to be delivered to members, in January 1794, and has ever since been regarded as &#145;perhaps the best of all the agricultural <span class="italic">Reports</span>&#146;  (R. E. Prothero, Baron Ernle, <span class="italic">English Farming, Past and Present</span>, 1961, 233). It divided Wiltshire between the north-west vale lands lying under the chalk hills and the south-east Wiltshire chalk downs. These were divided by geology along the foot of the chalk hills.<br>
<br>In 1792 Davis had surveyed the enclosure of Bagendon, near Cirencester, with the surveyor Edward Webb (1751&#150;1828), an estate which then belonged to the marquess of Bath. At a meeting of the Bath Society, Davis met the geologist William Smith, a recent pupil of Webb's. In 1796 Davis introduced Smith to the Revd Benjamin Richardson (1758&#150;1831), who started to champion Smith's remarkable geological results, as did Davis, who, as soon as he heard of Smith's pioneering work on strata, had commented that &#145;the only way to know the true value of land&#146; was in the light of such geological knowledge  (J. Phillips, <span class="italic">Memoirs of William Smith</span>, 1844, 16). At some early point during his stewardship a shaft in search of coal was put down on an outlying part of the Longleat estate; geological enquiry would help to prevent similar unprofitable investments.<br>
<br>Davis started to make use of Smith's results in his other careers as land agent and valuer. The best example of this work is the discreet and careful way he negotiated the purchase of the Eastbury and Gunville estates in Dorset for the Wedgwood family between 1800 and 1806. Davis also encouraged Smith with his work on water meadows, published in 1806. Their connections had been cemented in 1802 when Smith took on as his Bath partner Jeremiah Cruse (1758&#150;1819), whose son of the same name (1781&#150;1861) served the Longleat estates under four stewards for more than sixty-seven years. Davis's own gratitude to him is shown by the &pound;100 he left in his will to the younger Cruse, &#145;his faithful clerk as a token of my esteem and regard for him&#146;.<br>
<br>Many agricultural papers flowed from Davis's prolific pen between 1786 and 1808. These were on woodland and marshland management, dairy and arable farming, planting, wool, sheep, oak for the navy, grassland, blight in wheat, compensation for tithes, leasing on lives, plans for labourers' cottages, and other philanthropy, including the supply of milk to the poor. Davis's papers went not only to the Bath Society, but to other publications of the board of agriculture, to William Nicholson's <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy</span>, and to Arthur Young's <span class="italic">Annals of Agriculture</span>, though he was not always on good terms with Young because of &#145;a very rude illiberal attack&#146; which Young made on him concerning sheep management at a public meeting of the Bath Agricultural Society in the 1790s  (Stone, 196).<br>
<br>Davis was also long active as an independent land surveyor throughout the western counties, from the duchy of Cornwall's lands into Gloucestershire. He also served as clerk, surveyor, commissioner, and solicitor (although not in the modern legal sense) in enclosure work from 1763. Here he was regarded as &#145;a Commissioner of great reputation&#146;  (Sinclair, 331), particularly in Wiltshire. The words on his monumental inscription in Horningsham church, Wiltshire, which Davis composed himself, reveal his pride that such &#145;works have contributed so much to the beauty of [that] country and the comfort of its inhabitants&#146;. Davis was a notable improver who became active in the affairs of his local canal, the Dorset and Somerset Canal, sadly one of the least successful after its promotion in January 1793. He served on its first committee (1793) and in 1803 became a proprietor. Davis was also active as a botanist and a historian, contributing to the work of his fellow Wiltshire historian John Britton, and for a short time (1802&#150;04) he was a member of the London-based Society of Arts.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1807, at a meeting of the court baron at Frome, Somerset, Davis suffered a paralytic stroke. He died the next day and was buried inside Horningsham church on 16 November 1807. The extent of the loss his sudden death created can be gauged from this, from the printed funeral sermon issued in 1807, from the fine monument by Henry Westmacott (1784&#150;1861) put up to his memory in Horningsham church, and from the attendance at his funeral by the second marquess and both his brothers, Lord George Thynne (1770&#150;1838) and Lord John Thynne (1772&#150;1849). This was a solemn occasion which &#145;testified how much their departed friend was beloved in life, and lamented in death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 24.511). The wording of a tablet which the Bath Society intended to erect was equally impressive. Its secretary William Matthews (1747&#150;1816) paid his own tribute: &#145;whoever was personally acquainted with Thomas Davis, and <i>thousands</i> were, cannot fail to regret his removal, as a kind and warm-hearted associate; as a skilful arbiter of human rights; as a peace maker and as a good example in civil and social life&#146;  (Matthews, 271).<br>
<br>After his death Davis's agricultural report on Wiltshire was improved and re-issued in enlarged second (1811) and third editions (1813) by his eldest son Thomas Davis (1777&#150;1839), who succeeded him as steward of the Longleat estates and retained the post until his own death. William Marshall, &#145;not finding this any improvement&#146;, could still write that he &#145;preferred the original&#146; version in 1818  (W. Marshall, <span class="italic">Review and Abstract of the County Reports</span>, 1818, 184).<br>
