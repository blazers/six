<span class="headword">Cooke,  George Albert</span>  (1865&#150;1939), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London on 26 November 1865, the eldest son of George Isaac Foster Cooke, a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, and his wife, Agnes Marian, daughter of Stephen Mackenzie, a surgeon, and sister of Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837&#150;1892) and Sir Stephen Mackenzie (1844&#150;1909). He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School (where Hebrew was still taught) and in 1884 gained a Hebrew scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford. He was awarded a second class BA degree in theology in 1888 and won various prizes for Hebrew in 1886 and 1888 and the Houghton Syriac prize in 1889. Also in 1889 he was ordained and became curate of Headington; in the same year St John's College appointed him senior scholar and Hebrew lecturer. He became chaplain (1890) and fellow (1892&#150;9) of Magdalen College, and also held the cure of the university church (1894&#150;6) and the rectorship of Beaconsfield (1896&#150;9). While there he married in 1897 Frances Helen (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of Patrick Anderson, a man of business in Dundee; they had four daughters. From 1899 to 1908 Cooke was private chaplain to the duke of Buccleuch at Dalkeith, Midlothian, from 1904 to 1908 he was warden of the Community of St Andrew of Scotland, and from 1907 to 1908 was canon of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh. In 1903 he published his most important work, a <span class="italic">Textbook of North-Semitic Inscriptions</span>, which for the first time presented Hebrew and Aramaic epigraphy to English speaking students. He received an honorary degree of DD from Edinburgh University in 1911.<br>
<br>In 1908 Cooke returned to Oxford, where he succeeded T. K. Cheyne as Oriel professor of the interpretation of holy scripture, canon of Rochester Cathedral, and fellow of Oriel College. While in Oxford he undertook short commentaries for the Cambridge <span class="roman">Bible</span> on the books of <span class="roman">Judges</span> and <span class="roman">Ruth</span> (1913), and <span class="roman">Joshua</span> (1918). In 1914 he was appointed regius professor of Hebrew and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, a position which he resigned in 1936 in order to become rector of a parish of only ninety-five persons at Bettiscombe-with-Pilsdon, near Bridport, Dorset. It was here that he wrote his most ambitious works, the large-scale <span class="italic">Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of Ezekiel</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">The Prayer Book Psalter Revised</span> (1939), which attempted to preserve Coverdale's prose style within a more accurate biblical translation. Cooke died suddenly at the Imperial Nursing Home, Cheltenham, on 9 September 1939, following an operation.<br>
