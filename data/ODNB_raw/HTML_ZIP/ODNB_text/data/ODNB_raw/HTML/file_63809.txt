<span class="headword">Holmes, Sir  Maurice Gerald</span>  (1885&#150;1964), <span class="occ">civil servant and educationist</span>, was born on 14 June 1885, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46694/', "Edmond Gore Alexander Holmes (1850&#150;1936)")</script>, chief inspector of elementary schools for England, and his wife, Florence Mary (<i>d</i>. 1927), eldest daughter of Captain P. M. Syme RA. He had two sisters, one of whom was the engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66362/', "Verena Winifred Holmes")</script>. He went to school at Sutherland House, Folkestone (1894&#150;6), and then at Stanmore Park, Middlesex (1896&#150;9), before going on to Wellington College (1900&#150;04). He studied law at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1904 until 1908, when he was awarded a first-class degree in jurisprudence. He entered for the bar at the Inner Temple in 1908 (being called to the bar in 1909) and at this stage appeared destined for a legal career. When he applied in October 1908 to the Board of Education for a temporary position as a junior examiner he was already about to enter a barrister's chambers to gain further expertise in this area. He had no training or experience as a teacher, and his appointment came at a time when the board was heavily criticized for recruiting by patronage. However, his legal background and knowledge proved highly valuable throughout the rest of his long career in the department.<br>
<br>Holmes's early employment at the board consisted of a range of junior positions; he worked as a temporary barrister and then examiner in the technological branch, then as a junior examiner at assistant principal level at a salary of &pound;230 per annum. During the First World War he served in France, Belgium, Egypt, and Palestine, and rose to lieutenant-colonel in the Army Service Corps. He was appointed OBE for his military service in 1919. In 1917 he married Ivy Marie Beatrice (<i>b</i>. 1892), the daughter of Brigadier-General Francis Pearson Shaw Dunsford. They lived for most of their married life at 7 Sloane Street, London, and raised two daughters.<br>
<br>After the war Holmes rose swiftly within the Board of Education. He was entrusted with important duties in which, as the then permanent secretary of the board, L. A. Selby-Bigge, observed, he &#145;made good&#146;, and demonstrated &#145;great aptitude for Establishment work&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ED 36/4). In 1919 Selby-Bigge appointed him to the post of chief clerk of the Board of Education at the level of principal. Among the sensitive tasks for which he assumed much responsibility was the moving of Board of Education staff from the Victoria and Albert Museum to Whitehall in 1920. He also assisted with supply and transport in north Wales in view of a threatened strike of railway and transport workers in April 1921, a situation in which he apparently displayed &#145;great energy, capacity and resource&#146; in dealing with difficulties  (ibid.). In 1922 he became private secretary to the president of the Board of Education, initially H. A. L. Fisher and then Edward Wood. The following year, still in his thirties, he became director of establishments to the board, a prime-ministerial appointment. After the retirement of Sir Edward Chambers in 1926 he was appointed principal assistant secretary (secondary schools). Five years later he became deputy secretary of the board, and in 1937 he succeeded Sir (Edward) Henry Pelham, also a Balliol graduate, as permanent secretary at a fixed salary of &pound;3000 per annum. He was appointed KCB in 1938.<br>
<br>During his eight years as permanent secretary Holmes was largely responsible for managing the board's involvement in the major educational debates which culminated in the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944. He exhibited a shrewd capacity for working with the key figures on whom the board depended to construct reasoned positions on educational reform, and for developing the potential role of committees in specific areas of inquiry, such as the Norwood committee on the secondary-school curriculum and examinations and the Fleming committee on the public schools. He generally preferred the role of the board itself to be developed, and in fact strengthened during this period, out of the public eye rather than as part of a political debate. In 1941 the circulation of the so-called green book entitled <span class="italic">Education after the War</span>, a prototype statement of educational reconstruction composed by senior officials of the board, with a foreword by Holmes, was restricted to a small circle of insiders. His own opinions on key issues relating to reform carried a great deal of weight within the board, or the ministry as it became after 1944. He advised the president of the Board of Education, R. A. Butler, in 1942 that the duration of the war itself would largely determine the outcome of educational reforms: &#145;The longer it lasts, the more clamant the demand for social equality is likely to be&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ED 136/294).<br>
<br>Holmes could express his views precisely and often in strong terms, for instance in attributing the &#145;woefully inadequate&#146; provision of technical education to the lack of interest taken by industry and to external financial pressures  (TNA: PRO, ED 136/132). At the same time he avoided becoming involved in public controversies such as those to which his father had become attracted towards the end of his career. In this respect he also differed from his Edwardian predecessor Sir Robert Morant, who had been strongly influential in the debates that led to the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 but had himself become a focus of contention. Behind the scenes Holmes's authority and experience as an administrator constituted a key factor in the success of the Board of Education in negotiating a safe passage for the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> in 1944, and stands as his major contribution to the development of educational and social policy in twentieth-century Britain. It also helped to ensure not only broad social and political support but also lasting agreement around measures that were potentially divisive, a combination that was to elude attempts to recast the educational system later in the century.<br>
<br>Immediately after the war, in semi-retirement, Holmes remained influential, for example in his advice to the new education minister in the Labour government, Ellen Wilkinson, that, despite what he called &#145;constant pressure to secure that this or that subject is included in the curriculum of schools&#146;, it was better to resist such proposals on the ground that &#145;in this country&#146; the details of the curriculum were not controlled or dominated by the ministry, but were left to the determination of the local education authorities and the teachers  (TNA: PRO, ED 147/21). He retired in 1945 and was promoted GBE.<br>
<br>In 1947 Holmes served on the east African salaries commission and in 1948&#150;9 chaired the Caribbean public services commission. He also undertook a number of local inquiries for the Ministry of Transport. He was a governor of Wellington College and chairman of the Oxford and Cambridge Club. He maintained a keen interest in the work of George Bernard Shaw and in the life of Captain James Cook, and published bibliographies on both. He died at his London home, Flat 8, 7 Sloane Street, on 4 April 1964.<br>
