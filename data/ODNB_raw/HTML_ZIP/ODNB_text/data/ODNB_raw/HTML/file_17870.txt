<span class="headword">Malden,  Daniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1736), <span class="occ">prison-breaker</span>, was probably born in Canterbury; details of his parents are unknown. He trained as a postilion, and served for a time in the navy. After his discharge he became involved in petty crime in London. He was found guilty and received sentence of death at the Old Bailey on 10 May 1736 for stealing a large parcel of linen at Islington. His wife, Mary, John Holbert, and Holbert's wife, Ann, were also indicted but were acquitted  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Sessions Papers</span>, May 1736, 103&#150;4). He was ordered for execution on 24 May but on 14 May he escaped from Newgate. This was the first of two escape attempts and there is some confusion about the order of events. According to the <span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span>, acting on a hint from the previous occupant of his cell, he raised one of the floor planks, using the leg of a stool as a lever, and dropped into the cell beneath, which was on the ground floor. He got through the bars into the press-yard and then, by way of the chapel and the ordinary's house, onto the roof of the prison. After traversing the roofs of several adjoining houses he finally gained entry through a garret window to an empty house, &#145;late a pastrycook's in Newgate Street&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span>, 29 May 1736). Wrapping his irons close to his legs &#145;with rags and pieces of my jacket, as if I had been gouty or lame&#146;, he went &#145;out at a kitchen window, up one pair of stairs into Phoenix Court, and so through the streets to my home in Nightingale Lane&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ordinary's Account</span>, Nov 1736). According to other sources, however, Malden escaped with six others; they made their way down to the common sewer, from which &#145;four of them got up a vault in Fleet-lane&#146; (Caulfield, 4.67&#150;9; <span class="italic">GM</span>, 1736, 230).<br>
<br>Early in June Malden was retaken in Rosemary Lane, London. He was now placed in the &#145;old condemned hold&#146; in Newgate and doubly loaded with irons  (Griffiths, 304). A keeper named Austen left him his rations on the night of Sunday 13 June, when he seemed to be well secured. A few hours later he managed his second escape. Having got hold of a knife, which, according to different sources, had either been secreted about his person, or been given to him by a fellow prisoner, he sawed through the chain that held him, near the staple. He then managed to work a passageway under the seat in the corner of the condemned hold. This led into a funnel which connected with the main sewer. Though still encumbered by chains weighing nearly 100 lb he made his way along the sewer. Newgate runners were at once let into the sewer to look for him and found the bodies of two persons who had been smothered while trying to escape. But Malden, after remaining forty-eight hours in the sewer, eventually got out in a yard &#145;against the pump in Town Ditch, behind Christ's Hospital&#146;  (ibid., 306). He made his way to his wife's room in White's Yard, Rosemary Lane, where he was seen dining. A woman called Elizabeth Shelton, who was later accused of harbouring Malden but acquitted, reported seeing him in a lodging in White's Yard on the night of 14 June with fetters upon his legs &#145;and the Rivets of a prodigious Bigness, and the great Links of the Chain, and the great Rivets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Sessions Papers</span>, July 1736, 161&#150;3). According to Shelton she approached a smith named Germane to take Malden's irons off but he refused to help.<br>
<br>Malden again lingered about London and on 26 June was reported (apparently in error) to have been taken at Reading  (<span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, 26 June 1736). He subsequently made for Harwich, by way of Enfield, and journeyed to Flushing in the Netherlands where he was nearly persuaded to take foreign service, but returned to England &#145;in search of his wife&#146;  (Griffiths, 306). He seems to have returned with her to Canterbury, where he may have found employment as a groom or jockey. He was retaken in September by Akerman, a noted constable, and brought to London on 26 September. He reached the capital handcuffed and with his legs chained under the horse's belly yet guarded by thirty or forty horsemen. The roads and streets were lined with spectators anxious to see a criminal so notorious: &#145;he was as much talked of as the famous Jack Sheppard&#146;  (Caulfield, 4.67&#150;9). He was henceforth chained to the floor of his cell in Newgate and constantly and closely watched. Brought into court at the Old Bailey to be sentenced on Friday 15 October, he begged hard that he might be transported, having &#145;worked honestly at Canterbury, and done no robbery since last June&#146;. But he was hanged at Tyburn with two other convicts on 2 or 3 November 1736; his body &#145;was carried to Surgeons' Hall&#146; (<span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span>, 6 Nov 1736; <span class="italic">Old Whig</span>, 4 Nov 1736). His escapes are the more remarkable because Newgate had been &#145;strengthened&#146; after the notorious exploits of Jack Sheppard.<br>
