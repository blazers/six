<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wells <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Davies; <em>other married name </em>Sumbel]</span>,  Mary Stephens</span>  (1762&#150;1829), <span class="occ">actress</span>, one of the three daughters of Thomas Davies, a carver and gilder in Birmingham, was born in that city on 16 December 1762. Her father died in a madhouse while she was a small child. Her mother kept a tavern frequented by actors, including Richard Yates, under whose management both mother and daughter appeared on the stage. Mary Davies's early roles at the Birmingham theatre included the Duke of York in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Cupid in Whitehead's <span class="italic">A Trip to Scotland</span>, and Arthur in <span class="italic">King John</span>. After visiting Bath and York she went to Gloucester, where she played Juliet to the Romeo of an actor named Ezra Wells. They were married on 22 November 1778 in St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Wells shortly afterwards deserted her.<br>
<br>After provincial performances in Bristol and Plymouth, Mary Wells made her first appearance at the Haymarket on 1 June 1781, as Madge in Bickerstaffe's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> and Mrs Cadwallader in Foote's <span class="italic">Author</span>. On 3 September, in O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">The Agreeable Surprize</span>, she was the first Cowslip, a name that stuck to her (although she was occasionally spoken of as Becky Wells). Genest thought her acting as Cowslip was superior. On 25 September 1781, as Nancy in <span class="italic">The Camp</span>, she made her d&eacute;but at Drury Lane, where she remained for four seasons. Her roles included Mrs Oakley in Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, Widow Brady in Garrick's <span class="italic">The Irish Widow</span>, and Jacintha in Benjamin Hoadley's <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span>. At the Haymarket in 1782 she appeared as Molly in <span class="italic">The English Merchant</span>, and Bridget in <span class="italic">The Chapter of Accidents</span>. She also replaced Ann Cargill, after that lady's elopement, as Macheath in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, with the male characters played by women and vice versa. She made from the first a distinguished success, and was received with great enthusiasm.<br>
<br>As the title character in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, Mary Wells made her first appearance at Covent Garden on 14 December 1785, in what she considered her best performance. She also played Laura in Edward Topham's farce <span class="italic">The Fool</span> and a variety of other comic and tragic characters. She remained at Covent Garden for the following winter season, and continued her summer performances at the Haymarket. James Leigh, in <span class="italic">The New Rosciad</span>, complimented her &#145;magic smile&#146; and &#145;enchanting form&#146;, admitting that he was as pleased with her attempt at tragedy as he had previously been with her comic characters. When John Palmer made his ill-starred experiment at the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, in 1787, Wells gave her imitations of Sarah Siddons and other famous actresses, in <span class="italic">Ourselves, or, The Realities of the Stage</span>, which proved highly popular. She returned to Covent Garden, where she played Mrs Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Lady in Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span>, and Fatima in Garrick's <span class="italic">Cymon</span>. Here she remained until 1792, while acting in the summers at Cheltenham, Brighton, and Weymouth.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Wells's domestic affairs had become complicated. She had begun a liaison with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27551/', "Edward Topham (1751&#150;1820)")</script>, who was concerned in a daily newspaper called <span class="italic">The World</span>, which she assisted in producing. It served as a medium for complimentary criticisms of her performances. However, by 1792 Topham had taken their three daughters and left her for another woman. Wells had, moreover, backed bills for a considerable amount for her brother-in-law, Emmanuel Samuel, the husband of Anna Davies, who appeared at the Haymarket on 28 July 1786. This last indiscretion involved her in endless trouble. More than once she was a prisoner in the Fleet and in other places of detention in England and Ireland. Frederick Reynolds, who described her as the most beautiful actress of her day, tells of her eccentricities and erratic behaviour. In her own memoirs, she denied the charge of madness, but resorted to staying with Dr Francis Willis in Lincolnshire to avoid her creditors.<br>
<br>This was to little avail, and it was in the Fleet that Wells met her second husband, Joseph Sumbel, who was confined there for contempt of court. Sumbel was a Moorish Jew, and secretary to the ambassador from Morocco. Their reputedly lavish wedding was performed in the Fleet in October 1797 to the amusement of contemporary newspapers, which recorded that the bride had converted to Judaism and changed her name to Leah. Evidently a man of morbid temperament, Sumbel seems to have alternately made passionate love to her and disowned her and left her to starve. A year later he sought unsuccessfully to have the marriage dissolved, declaring that on account of failure to follow the prescribed ceremony she was not his wife. He apparently died abroad in 1804. After their separation, she reverted to Christianity.<br>
<br>The three volumes of her rambling autobiography, initially advertised in Brighton in 1792 and published in 1811 as <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Mrs Sumbel, Late Wells</span>, are occupied principally with details of travels in search of her children and denunciations of Topham, Sumbel, and Samuel. The third volume is composed largely of printed compliments on her performances and correspondence from Topham and Reynolds.<br>
<br>Although the actress had no permanent engagement in London after 1792, she made occasional appearances under the name Mary Sumbel in London into the nineteenth century. After a final benefit performance, in 1815, she spent her later years in lodgings with her aged mother. She also applied to the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund, and received an annuity of &pound;55 until her death in London on 23 January 1829. She was buried in St Pancras, London.<br>
