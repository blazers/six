<span class="headword">Birinus</span> <span class="st"> [St Birinus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>650), <span class="occ">bishop of Dorchester</span>, was the first bishop of the see of the Gewisse, whose rulers subsequently became kings of the West Saxons. He was consecrated bishop in 634 by Bishop Asterius of Milan in Genoa on the orders of Pope Honorius and given a general brief to convert pagan Anglo-Saxons. Birinus's own ethnic identity is never stated, but the form of his name suggests that he could, like other early missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons, have been a Frank. Bede relates that when Birinus arrived in Britain he visited the Gewisse first and, finding them all pagan, decided to stay among them rather than to go further seeking others to evangelize. King Cynegils was baptized by Birinus in 635, with his overlord King Oswald of Northumbria as godfather. Subsequently Birinus baptized Cynegils's son Cwichelm in 636 and in 639 his grandson Cuthred to whom he became godfather. Another son of Cynegils, Cenwalh, who succeeded him <i>c</i>.642, remained unconverted until after the bishop's death, which had occurred by <i>c</i>.650. Birinus is said by Bede to have built churches and converted many people, but no detailed traditions seem to have survived to be included in his eleventh-century life, which was probably written in Winchester. The only recorded miracles are his miraculous preservation from a shipwreck on the way to Britain, when he walked on water, and the healing of a blind and deaf woman; neither contains any convincing circumstantial details. Birinus was buried at Dorchester, but was subsequently translated to Old Minster, Winchester, in the episcopate of H&aelig;dde, by which time the West Saxons had lost control of the Dorchester-on-Thames area. Birinus appears regularly in late Saxon calendars with the feast day of 3 December. His cult was revived by Bishop &AElig;thelwold of Winchester who translated his body on 4 September 980 and he figures prominently in Winchester liturgies. In the thirteenth century the canons of Dorchester claimed that they possessed the saint's body and part of his supposed shrine survives there.<br>
