<span class="headword">Chidley,  Katherine</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1616&#150;1653), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and Leveller</span>, was of unknown origins and background. By 1616 she was married to Daniel Chidley (<i>fl</i>. 1616&#150;1649), a tailor of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and in the same year gave birth to their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37279/', "Samuel Chidley")</script>; seven more children were born to the couple by 1629. During the 1620s Katherine and her husband were active in a Shrewsbury conventicle which carried on a running quarrel with the rector of St Chad's, Peter Studley. In 1626 she and Daniel were among twenty people presented to the consistory court for non-attendance at church. She was also reported for refusing &#145;to come to be churched after childbirth&#146;  (Lichfield Joint RO, B/C/1, B/C/5, B/C/2). Persecution by the established church drove her and her family to flee to the relative anonymity of London at the end of the 1620s. There Daniel obtained his freedom of the Haberdashers' Company in 1632; there too they joined other separatists like John Duppa and John Lilburne in their struggle against the bishops.<br>
<br>Shortly after the Long Parliament met in November 1640 the printer William Larner published Katherine Chidley's first tract, <span class="italic">The Justification of the Independant Churches of Christ</span> (1641). It was an eighty-one-page riposte to the arguments of the London preacher Thomas Edwards for hierarchical and centralized church government, and a biblical defence of congregational and wifely autonomy. Conceding that her answers were &#145;not laid down in a schollerlik way&#146;, she nevertheless claimed for them &#145;the plaine truth of holy Scripture&#146;  (sig. A2b). Churches ought to be exclusive in their membership, she averred, because, &#145;when God brought his people into the promised land, he commanded them to be separated from the idolaters&#146;  (sig. A3b). Churches did not require pastors or teachers, for &#145;all the Lords people, that are made Kings and Priests to God, have a free voyce in the Ordinance of Election, therefore they must freely consent before there can be any Ordination&#146;  (p. 5). Bitterly she compared the officers of the Church of England to &#145;those Locusts, which ascended out of the bottomlesse pit&#146;  (p. 11), and denied that any congregation had the power to censure another. The humblest members of society, &#145;whether they be Taylors, Felt-makers, Button-makers, Tent-makers, shepherds or ploughmen, or what honest trade soever&#146;, were better qualified to create churches than &#145;ill-meaning priests&#146;  (p. 22). A future presbyterian, Edwards was afraid that religious toleration would undermine the authority of husbands, fathers, and masters over their wives, children, and servants. Chidley refuted him with a text from the seventh chapter of <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span>, which declared that a wife may be a believer and the husband an unbeliever: &#145;I pray you tell me&#146;, she taunted him, &#145;what authority this unbeleeving husband hath over the conscience of his beleeving wife; It is true he hath authority over her in bodily and civill respects, but not to be a Lord over her conscience&#146;  (p. 26). She concluded by admitting that she was &#145;a poor worme and unmeete to deal with you&#146;  (p. 81), but that did not stop her from throwing down a challenge to her antagonist to debate her publicly on the merits of religious separatism.<br>
<br>In January 1645 Chidley crossed swords a second time with the presbyterian polemicist in <span class="italic">A New-Yeares-Gift &hellip; to Mr. Thomas Edwards</span>, a repudiation of the aspersions he had cast on the personal conduct of the separatists in his <span class="italic">Antapologia</span>. Dismissing his book as &#145;a rangling, insinuating, contradictory, revengefull story&#146;, she added &#145;it appeared unto me a taske most befitting a woman &hellip; to answer it&#146;  (sig. A2a). The Church of England was, she wrote, not a true but a deformed church, which, by admitting all comers to the sacraments, was guilty of &#145;casting Gods holy things to dogs&#146;  (p. 10). Distancing herself from the antinomians she denied that the toleration claimed by the separatists was &#145;a Toleration to sinne&#146;; it was rather the &#145;peaceable enjoyment of our liberty to worship God&#146;  (p. 16). She ended with the advice, &#145;doe not seeke shifts and superfuges. Consider and receive admonition, though it be from a woman&#146;  (p. 22). The last publication to appear under Chidley's own name was a broadsheet, <span class="italic">Good counsell, to the petitioners for presbyterian government, that they may declare their faith before they build their Church</span>. Printed in November 1645 it denounced the presbyterian ministers of London for being interested only in their own maintenance and power. She appealed for the release of imprisoned separatists and reiterated her offer to debate the presbyterians on any matter of church doctrine.<br>
<br>In his next book, <span class="italic">Gangraena</span>, Edwards sneeringly dismissed Katherine Chidley as &#145;a brasen-faced audacious old woman&#146;  (Edwards, 3.170). Whatever her physical appearance, there is no doubt about her audacity. Not only did she write boldly about religious questions, she was a zealous evangelist. Edwards records that she won converts in Stepney, where she also tangled with the moderate Independent minister William Greenhill. In 1647 she and her son Samuel travelled to Bury St Edmunds, where they helped found a separatist church. The two signed as witnesses to the covenant whereby the congregation of eight adults and six children bound themselves &#145;to become a peculiar Temple for the Holy Ghoste to dwell in, an entier spouse of Jesus Christ our Lord of Glory&#146;  (&#145;Bury St. Edmunds church covenants&#146;, 334). Samuel was the more prolific pamphleteer, but according to Edwards mother and son collaborated closely, &#145;the one inditing and the other writing&#146;  (Edwards, 3.170), and they lived in the same house at least until the end of 1652. Daniel appears to have died soon after 1649, for in the early 1650s Katherine evidently took over his haberdashery business. She landed at least two substantial contracts to supply 4000 and 1000 pairs of stockings to the parliamentary army in Ireland, signing the receipts for her payments in a shaky hand.<br>
<br>In the late 1640s Chidley and her son flung themselves wholeheartedly into London's radical politics, when she emerged as a leader of Leveller women. In April 1649 several hundred of them besieged parliament, demanding the release of the Leveller leaders from prison. In their second petition, which may have been written by Chidley, they justified their political activity on the basis of &#145;our creation in the image of God, and of an interest in Christ equal unto men, as also of a proportionable share in the freedoms of this commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Petition of Women, Affecters and Approvers of the Petition of Sept. 11, 1648</span>, 1649). In 1653 the Leveller leader John Lilburne found himself on trial once more. Again Chidley rallied to his defence, organizing a petition to Barebone's Parliament that reportedly garnered over 6000 female signatures. The women boldly knocked on the door, but the house sent out one of its members, Praise-God Barebone, to persuade them to abandon their enterprise. Their persistence wore him down, however, so another MP was sent out. This anonymous member told them that parliament could not recognize their petition, &#145;they being women and many of them wives, so that the Law tooke no notice of them&#146;. They retorted that not all of them were wives, &#145;and therefore pressed for the receiving of their petition, which if they refused they should know that they had husbands and friends and they wore swords to defend the libertys of the people &amp;c.&#146;  (MS Clarendon 46, fols. 131<i>v</i>&#150;132). Chidley's date of death is unknown and perhaps she died soon after this episode, since nothing more is heard of her, whether as religious writer, political activist, or successful woman of business.<br>
