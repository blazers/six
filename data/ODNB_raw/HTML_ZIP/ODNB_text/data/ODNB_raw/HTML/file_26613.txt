<span class="headword">Stowel,  John</span>  (1762&#150;1799), <span class="occ">poet</span>, born at Douglas, Isle of Man, on 28 March 1762, was one of fifteen sons (each of whom, as his father remarked, &#145;had a sister&#146;) of Thomas Stowel and his wife, Ann Brown. Little is known of Stowel's education or early life other than the fact that, like several of his brothers, he was conspicuous for his strongly developed physical talents and literary ambition. He was an accomplished scholar. On 5 July 1792 he was appointed master of the Classical Free School (also known as the Latin school) at Peel, a job he performed conscientiously, but for which he seemingly never showed much enthusiasm or ambition. Stowel was more interested in poetry, though in May 1793 he did advertise his services as a tutor of English to private students on the island.<br>
<br>In 1790 Stowel's small book of poems, <span class="italic">A Sallad for the Young Ladies and Gentlemen of Douglas, Raised by Tom the Gardner</span>, was published by Robert Callister, formerly of the Isle of Man but then resident in Liverpool. In the same year Stowel published <span class="italic">The Retrospect, or, A Review of the Memorable Events of Mona</span>, a satire on the Manx House of Keys and on the town of Douglas. Both works, lacking literary merit, attracted considerable local ridicule. One influential voice, the editor of the <span class="italic">Manx Mercury</span>, wrote that:<blockquote>Verses signed Tom the Gardener are as much like the production of the gentleman who has hitherto been distinguished by that signature as Mr Callister's Songs are like Homer's Iliad. Their author ought to have his ears &#145;cropt&#146; for his presumption.</blockquote>In 1791 <span class="italic">The Literary Quixote</span>, a satire on the <span class="italic">Journal of Richard Townley</span>, a book on the Isle of Man, was published privately by Stowel and the following year he produced an elegy in verse on Mrs Callow and Miss Bacon. In 1793 <span class="italic">An Elegiac Invocation of the Muses</span> appeared and on 27 April 1796 his last work, an address in verse to the duchess of Atholl, the wife of the governor-in-chief of the Isle of Man, was published.<br>
<br>Although Stowel sought entry into the world of words he achieved little; as a person, however, it appears that he was held in high regard. He died, unmarried, at Peel, Isle of Man, on 21 July 1799 and was buried at Patrick parish church.<br>
