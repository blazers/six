<span class="headword">Baber,  Edward Colborne</span>  (1843&#150;1890), <span class="occ">orientalist and traveller</span>, the son of Edward Baber and a great-nephew of Henry Hervey Baber, was born at Dulwich on 30 April 1843. He was educated at Rossall junior school where his father was headmaster, and from 1853 to 1862 at Christ's Hospital, going on from there with a scholarship to Magdalene College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1867. In 1866 he had gained through competitive examination a position as a Foreign Office student interpreter. He was appointed to Peking (Beijing) on 28 July 1866. Baber wrote to his father on 29 June 1867 of his studies of the Chinese language reporting how &#145;I have been working with small intermission between nine and twelve hours a day for six months, and yesterday evening I finished the colloquial course &hellip; the shortest time it has ever been done in&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 2nd ser., 5 July 1883, 469).<br>
<br>Baber passed quickly through the various grades of the service. He was promoted to third-class assistant on 18 November 1869, second-class assistant on 24 August 1871, and was acting vice-consul at Kiukiang (Jiujiang) from 1 September 1871 to 9 May 1872. He was acting vice-consul at Taipei (Tabei) in Taiwan from 6 June 1872 until 30 September 1873, and was appointed Chinese secretary of legation at Peking on 22 October 1879.<br>
<br>During this period, Baber made three very interesting journeys in the interior of China. The first of these was in 1876, when he accompanied Thomas Grosvenor across Yunnan to Bham&ograve;, on the Burmese frontier, to investigate the murder of Augustus Raymond Margary. He prepared a map and narrative of the expedition, which formed the substance of the official blue book issued in 1877. He then journeyed to the Szechwan (Sichuan) highlands in 1877, during which he visited and studied the language of the Lolos tribe. A detailed account of this journey, with descriptions of Chinese customs and attitudes, was printed in 1886 under the title <span class="italic">Travels and Researches in Western China</span>. In 1878 he journeyed from Chungking (Chongqing) northward by a new route through mountain country, occupied by the Xifan tribes, to the great Lhasa Road, and wrote a monograph entitled <span class="italic">The Chinese Tea-Trade with Thibet</span> (1886). On 28 May 1883 he was presented with a Royal Geographical Society patron's medal.<br>
<br>From 23 October 1885 to 24 November 1886, Baber was acting consul-general in Korea. Soon afterwards he received the appointment of political resident at Bham&ograve; on the upper Irrawaddy, where he died unmarried on 16 June 1890, at the age of forty-seven.<br>
