<span class="headword">Bower,  Alexander</span>  (1774&#150;1837), <span class="occ">writer and minister of the Relief church</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 18 March 1774, the son of John Bower, weaver, and Janet Matthew. The elder Bower, according to a relative, John Campbell (1766&#150;1840), was an elder in the Relief church, and Alexander, following attendance at classes at Edinburgh University between 1787 and 1794, trained to be a clergyman. He was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Armagh, before being received as a probationer by the Relief Presbytery of Edinburgh on 23 May 1799. He married, in Edinburgh on 29 December 1799, Miss Addison Henderson; they had at least two children. He became minister of the Relief congregation of Shiprow church, Aberdeen, on 6 November 1799, but rapidly lost the confidence of a large section of his congregation and in the summer of 1805 attempts were made to have him removed. He resigned on 6 September 1806 and probably moved to Edinburgh shortly thereafter. In the years following 1810 he was employed by both the Advocates' Library and Edinburgh University Library as a cataloguer. In a letter dated 26 November 1813, to an unknown correspondent, Bower declared that &#145;my life has been devoted to literature&#146;  (Edinburgh University, MS La II.501, fol. 336), but in the following year he unsuccessfully attempted to be recognized by the Relief Presbytery of Edinburgh as a probationer. He appears to have sunk further and further into poverty as he got older, and died, probably in Edinburgh, on 23 February 1837.<br>
<br>Bower first appeared in print with <span class="italic">An Address to the Inhabitants of the North of Scotland, upon the Threatened Invasion</span> (1803), and this was followed by his edition of <span class="italic">An Essay on the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures</span> (1806), by an unknown author. His most substantial works are biographies of James Beattie (1804) and Martin Luther (1813) and a <span class="italic">History of the University of Edinburgh</span> (3 vols., 1817&#150;30). These have long been superseded, apart from some incidental biographical detail in the first- and last-named. He also produced histories of Scotland and Ireland for children (both 1819), as well as <span class="italic">The Edinburgh Student's Guide</span> (1822) and <span class="italic">A letter to the &hellip; lord provost &hellip; upon the subject of providing dead bodies for the students of medicine</span> (1823).<br>
