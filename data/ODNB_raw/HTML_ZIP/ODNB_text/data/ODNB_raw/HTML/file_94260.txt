<span class="headword">Buckley,  Wilfred</span>  (1873&#150;1933), <span class="occ">promoter of clean milk and collector of antique glass</span>, was born at 27 Wheeleys Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 13 June 1873, the second son and second of the four children of Henry Buckley (1838&#150;1903), general merchant, and his wife, Caroline Therese (1847&#150;1891), daughter of Martin Parry Kennard of Boston, Massachusetts, and his wife, Caroline Augusta.<br>
<br>Buckley was educated at Giggleswick School in Yorkshire from 1885 to 1889, and then worked in the family business handling the export of Birmingham manufactures. About 1895 he was sent to America to manage the firm's New York office. There he met a Fifth Avenue heiress, Bertha (1873&#150;1937), daughter of Herbert Leslie Terrell. They were married on 31 December 1898 at the Protestant Episcopal church of All Souls on Madison Avenue, New York city. They had one daughter, Janet, born on 3 June 1901.<br>
<br>Buckley subsequently returned to England and in 1906 he bought the Moundsmere estate at Preston Candover in Hampshire, where he had a Palladian-style mansion built. Though initially ignorant of farming matters, he soon began taking a keen interest in the management of his estate. He instituted proper record keeping and introduced several innovations, including poultry, a prizewinning herd of pedigree Berkshire pigs, and a dairy that produced milk of exceptional hygienic quality. In 1917 he published an account of this work in a book called <span class="italic">Farm Records and the Production of Clean Milk at Moundsmere</span>.<br>
<br>The dairy came about because, shortly after the Buckleys' arrival in England, Janet contracted tubercular glands. Although she recovered successfully, her parents were advised that in future she should only have milk guaranteed free of bovine tubercle. The Buckleys knew that in the United States such &#145;certified&#146; milk was widely available but in England it was quite unknown. Buckley therefore set up his own dairy so that Janet should have milk of this standard. The venture soon developed into a commercial undertaking. The milk was bottled and taken by train each day to London, where it was distributed among the West End stores.<br>
<br>By the early 1900s the production and distribution of milk had developed into a major industry, yet its hygienic quality was very poor. Most farmers carried out the milking by hand in the cow barn amid bedding straw and manure, and with the cattle so caked in dirt that loose hair, dust, and manure would fall liberally into the open pail. The milk was then poured into churns and taken to the railway station, where it would be loaded into warm railway vans with other goods and livestock. The actual delivery to the consumer usually entailed ladling the milk from the roundsman's dray into a jug, and this operation invariably took place over the gutter.<br>
<br>All these hazards left the milk heavily contaminated with bacteria. Many practitioners in the fields of medicine, public health, and social welfare claimed that this not only undermined the nutritive value of milk but helped to propagate diseases such as typhoid, scarlet fever, and tuberculosis. By the 1900s a possible solution to the problem had come into being with the development of pasteurization, but the efficacy of such heat treatment was widely disputed. There was also a multiplicity of public health authorities and a lack of powers to enforce hygienic standards in milk production and distribution. Successive governments were deterred from pursuing reform because of the difficulties in reconciling the conflicting interests and by the lack of any strong public agitation.<br>
<br>In these circumstances initiatives such as Buckley's model dairy at Moundsmere aroused considerable interest among the clean milk advocates. In 1910&#150;11 it formed the subject of a study by a certified milk committee chaired by the physician Sir Thomas Barlow. Buckley himself was soon drawn into playing an active role&#151;penning letters to the press, drafting leaflets, giving lectures, and lobbying government over milk legislation. Although he always remained an enthusiastic amateur, he was able to engage the support of a wide range of professionals and government officials, and in 1915 he founded a pressure group called the National Clean Milk Society (NCMS), of which he served as chairman. Through these activities Buckley became the effective leader of the movement.<br>
<br>In 1917 Buckley was invited to become director of milk supplies at the Ministry of Food and served in this capacity until April 1920. His prime task was to set fair prices, but he also used his position to promote the clean milk cause. In 1918 he introduced the first milk grading scheme, which was to be further extended over the following years. In 1920 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Buckley, as chairman of the NCMS, worked tirelessly at giving lectures, organizing conferences, and mounting practical demonstrations of clean milk production at agricultural shows. He was a leading figure in the National Milk Publicity Council and the Certified Milk Producers' Association, and was a keen supporter of the National Institute for Research in Dairying at Reading. He served on a milk advisory committee to the ministries of Health and Agriculture, and during the general strike he was appointed emergency milk commissioner.<br>
<br>The dairy industry generally derided Buckley's views on the need for improved methods in the production and distribution of milk. Such criticisms never deflected him from the cause, though he became increasingly dispirited at the apathy of both government and public. In 1928 he decided to wind up the NCMS, but continued to play an active role in the movement.<br>
<br>Buckley always had a keen interest in literature and art and especially in antique glass. Over the years he built up a sizeable collection that became widely known among his fellow collectors. As the milk campaign faltered, so he devoted more time to his fine art interests. He wrote a series of books for collectors, notably <span class="italic">European Glass</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Diamond Engraved Glasses of the Sixteenth Century</span> (1929), and took part in organizing several major exhibitions, in particular an exhibition of Italian art in 1930 for which he was made a grand officer of the order of the Crown of Italy. All this brought a number of eminent visitors to Moundsmere, including Queen Mary, who made a private visit in 1931.<br>
<br>Buckley died in a nursing home at 16 Fitzroy Square, London, on 26 October 1933, following an operation for cancer. After cremation at Woking on 30 October his ashes were buried later that day at Preston Candover.<br>
<br>Tall and athletic in bearing, Buckley possessed wide-ranging abilities and pursued a variety of interests: he was a highly competent mathematician with a particular bent for statistics, a keen sportsman, and a student of the classics, literature, and art. His manner was kindly and considerate but he was capable of a blunt honesty which could sometimes border on tactlessness. His tragedy was that he died with the clean milk crusade only half won. In the years following his death the Milk Marketing Board introduced various schemes for improving milk quality, while the Second World War wrought profound changes to the supply and consumption of milk that endured in the post-war period. As a result of his relatively early death, however, Buckley's contribution to these improvements was generally overlooked and this robbed him of the recognition he deserved as a pioneer in the clean milk campaign.<br>
