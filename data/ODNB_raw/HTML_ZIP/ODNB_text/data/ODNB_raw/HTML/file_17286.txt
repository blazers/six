<span class="headword">Lyon, Sir  Thomas, of Auldbar</span>, master of Glamis  (<em>c.</em>1546&#150;1608), <span class="occ">nobleman and administrator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17277/', "John Lyon, seventh Lord Glamis (b. c.1521, d. in or before 1559)")</script>, and his wife, Jean, daughter of Robert Keith, master of Marischal; he was perhaps two years younger than his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17278/', "John Lyon, later eighth Lord Glamis (c.1544&#150;1578)")</script>. The Lyon family held substantial lands in Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, and Fife, but their power base and main estates lay in Forfarshire. Descended from Robert II through the marriage of the latter's daughter Johanna to Sir John Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1382), and closely linked through marriage and geographical proximity to the comital families of Angus, Argyll, Atholl, Huntly, and Rothes, the Lyon family was prominent in local and national politics from the 1360s onwards&#151;though not always in favour with the monarch. Thomas's father had been declared a traitor in 1537 and was forfeit until 1544. His brother John, Lord Glamis, backed Regent Moray against Mary, queen of Scots, from 1567, and was consistently loyal to the protestant regencies of Moray, Lennox, and Morton; on 8 October 1573 he was appointed chancellor of the kingdom in the name of James VI. These loyalties undoubtedly helped secure for Thomas Lyon, while he was still a young man, the post of attendant upon the infant James VI in Stirling Castle. Also around this period Thomas was slowly establishing a position for himself within his family's sphere of influence: in March 1567 he was presented by his elder brother to the Forfarshire chaplainry of Baikie (valued at under &pound;10 a year), and in 1571 Glamis allowed him to purchase the estate of Scrogerfield (Thomas was a committed protestant who drew revenue from the chaplainry until at least 1576).<br>
<br>On the violent death of the eighth lord on 17 March 1578 Thomas Lyon became responsible for the tutelage and upbringing of his nephew Patrick, ninth Lord Glamis (1575&#150;1615), a position he held until 1596. Through traditional family influence, religious conviction, and individual force of personality, the master of Glamis (as he was called from his being his nephew's heir presumptive) was soon able to draw on long-established Lyon alliances in and around Forfarshire. He also used his considerable political abilities to manipulate his nephew's lordship so as to acquire significant additional estates and to expand his personal sphere of influence within Forfarshire (in December 1579 he had to lodge a security for &pound;5000 that he would not impinge on the estates belonging to his sister-in-law and her daughter). Some time before 1575 he married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1580&times;86), daughter of Patrick Gray of Buttergask and sister of Patrick, fifth Lord Gray (and widow successively of Robert Logan of Restalrig and Alexander, fifth Lord Home). The marriage, which produced two daughters, caused an acrimonious dispute between the master and the family of his wife's previous husband, the Homes. Although Lyon was granted the right to act as keeper of Home Castle for the crown in November 1578, he was relieved of the post a month later, as Andrew Kerr, commendator of Jedburgh, had obtained possession and was unwilling to surrender.<br>
<br>Building upon his local influence, Lyon expanded his involvement in the national arena: in March 1578&#151;at the time when his elder brother was killed&#151;he was involved in the negotiations which secured the resignation of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, as regent; and in 1582 he was one of the most prominent of the Ruthven raiders who undertook a palace coup against the regime of Esm&eacute; Stewart, duke of Lennox, and James Stewart, earl of Arran. A little before dawn on 23 August 1582, Lyon, with William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie, and John Erskine, second earl of Mar, accompanied by 1000 troops, surrounded Ruthven Castle (Huntingtower) in Perthshire and announced to the king that he was under their control. While the other malcontents placed before their monarch a supplication detailing the wrongs committed by Lennox and his supporters, the master suggested to the king that instead of preparing to hunt in the fields he should return to his playroom and his hobby horse. After the raiders had returned the king to his boyhood residence of Stirling, the master again confronted the king when the latter wanted to visit his capital. When James burst into tears on being refused permission to visit Edinburgh, Lyon, who had blocked the way by placing his leg across an open doorway, responded with the comment that &#145;better bairns should weep than bearded men&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 2.290). During the period of the Ruthven regime, the master appeared at first in the sederunts of the privy council, but he exercised his influence mostly in close counsels with the earls of Angus and Mar.<br>
<br>On James's &#145;escape&#146; from the Ruthven regime to St Andrews in June 1583, Lyon was ordered to ward in Dumbarton Castle (within three days) and was instructed to surrender his houses of Glamis, Auldbar, Baikie, and Dod. Instead he fled from Scotland, taking refuge first in Ireland and then in England. On 31 January 1584 he was charged to leave Scotland, England, and Ireland, under pain of treason. Within three months, however, he was back in Scotland (along with Angus and Mar), in an attempt to overthrow the politically dominant earl of Arran by seizing Stirling Castle (on 17 April 1584) and holding it against the king's government. The rebellion was short-lived and the master, along with his companions, again fled, faced by King James at the head of an army said to number 12,000. He took up residence in Westminster and secretly corresponded with the English government. In Scotland, parliament passed an act of forfeiture on 22 August 1584 against him, along with Angus, Mar, and their supporters.<br>
<br>In October 1585 Lyon secretly returned to Scotland and met with other discontented lords at the residence in Kelso of Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell. By 2 November the lords were before Stirling Castle seeking Arran's removal from authority and their own pardon. Arran fled through the castle postern, and on 4 November Lyon and other conspirators were pardoned. Three days later Lyon was officially admitted to the privy council, and he also replaced Arran as captain and commander of the king's guard. Shortly afterwards, on 2 December, he was appointed treasurer (in succession to the third earl of Montrose), with a salary of &pound;1000 Scots a year. Although he never achieved the office he coveted most&#151;that of chancellor (like his late brother)&#151;in December his estates were restored in parliament, and on 9 February 1586 he was created an extraordinary lord of session, again replacing Montrose. It was unusual for so prominent a nobleman to take on the onerous and regular duties of the session, but such a position had been held by Lyon's brother between 1570 and 1573, and the master may have owed his promotion more to heritage than to legal knowledge.<br>
<br>His first wife having died, on 9 February 1586 Lyon married Eupheme, daughter of William Douglas, fifth earl of Morton; they had two sons and a daughter. His influence within the Angus homelands of the Lyons led to his becoming involved in his family's long-running feud with the Lindsay earls of Crawford (recently aggravated by the eleventh earl of Crawford's alleged responsibility for the death of the eighth Lord Glamis). In November 1579, in an attempt to settle the feud, Crawford was obliged to give assurance that he would not harm the master of Glamis and would seek licence to travel to the continent (on surety of &pound;10,000), but this action was unsuccessful and the feud continued, with bloodshed on both sides, throughout the early 1580s (while Crawford supported the Lennox and Arran regimes, and the master strongly opposed them). On 14 December 1586, however, as senior representative of the Lyons, the master of Glamis exchanged assurances with Crawford to settle their differences, and six months later, following a reconciliation banquet given by the king, Thomas Lyon and the earl walked arm in arm along the High Street of Edinburgh to parliament.<br>
<br>In January 1587 Lyon was appointed a commissioner for grants from crown lands, but his influence waned somewhat towards the end of the 1580s, partly because of his difficulties in dealing with the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane. He lost the captaincy of the guard to two of the king's favourites, firstly to Alexander Lindsay (later first Lord Spynie and the earl of Crawford's uncle&#151;an action which renewed the feud), and then on 28 November 1588 to George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly. Strongly protestant and an Anglophile, the master was usually an opponent of the conservative Huntly, making him an obvious target for attack when the earl and his supporters rose against the king in 1589. The master attempted to oppose the rebels, but was surprised and cornered in his house at Kirkhill by Huntly's lieutenant, Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun. On his failing to surrender, the house was burned around him and he was captured and taken north to Auchindoun; he was released only when the king took to the field and marched to oppose Huntly.<br>
<br>Lyon was knighted at the coronation of Queen Anna on 17 May 1590, but continuing difficulties with Thirlestane and suspicions of involvement with the renegade earl of Bothwell (with whom previously he had been at odds) led to his being imprisoned in Blackness Castle for a short period in November 1591, and then being warded north of the River Dee (his ward, Lord Glamis, was also placed in protective custody as a result of the master's links with Bothwell). Lyon also briefly lost his seat on the session (restored to the earl of Montrose) but recovered it in March 1593 on the promotion of John Cockburn of Ormiston. In May 1593 he was advanced to be an ordinary lord of session, following the death of Lord President Provand. The master's involvement with Bothwell was short-lived; indeed, he was exiled from court during the earl's brief recovery of favour in the autumn of 1593. Reconciliation with Thirlestane followed and the two men returned to court following Bothwell's fall. In April 1594 the master led 400 royal troops into a confrontation with Bothwell during the latter's &#145;raid&#146; on Leith, but after the king's vanguard under Lord Home had been scattered, Lyon's troops also dispersed, having done little fighting.<br>
<br>Lyon's position became significantly weaker during 1596. In that year a group of eight commissioners, the Octavians, took over responsibility for management of the royal finances. The master initially refused to demit the office of treasurer, but the Octavians established that large sums of money were due to the exchequer from him, and in return for his leaving office these debts were cancelled. On 6 March the master of Glamis was replaced as treasurer by Walter Stewart, Lord Blantyre, after receiving a gift of &pound;6000. Also in 1596 the master's nephew Patrick, ninth Lord Glamis, came of age, and his wife gave birth to a son and heir, John (later tenth Lord Glamis and second earl of Kinghorne). No longer master of Glamis, Sir Thomas Lyon of Auldbar (as he was thereafter usually known) and his nephew initially came to an amicable agreement regarding the former's acquisition of estates during Glamis's minority. Shortly afterwards, however, the pair fell out over a transaction concerning Tannadyce (the estate was subsequently held by James Lyon, an illegitimate son of Sir Thomas's), and Auldbar entered litigation against his nephew (which he lost). During 1598 Auldbar removed himself from public life and was permitted to remain away from court &#145;in respect of his greet deseis&#146;  (Brunton and Haig, 205). He also demitted his place on the session. Thereafter he lived quietly on his estates, for long enough to see his nephew elevated to comital status as earl of Kinghorne, Lord Lyon, and Glamis, in July 1606. Sir Thomas Lyon died in Forfarshire on 18 February 1608.<br>
