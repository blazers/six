<span class="headword">Trail,  Walter</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1345?, <em>d.</em> 1401), <span class="occ">bishop of St Andrews</span>, is of unknown origins. Although one version of Walter Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span> claims that he was almost seventy when he died in 1401, Trail's appearance as a student in Paris in the mid-1360s suggests a date of birth shortly before 1345. He was educated at the universities of Paris and Orl&eacute;ans, where his studies in arts and law extended through much of the 1360s and 1370s. In this period he obtained an MA degree and became a doctor of both civil and canon law. He spent the early part of his ecclesiastical career in the papal curia. Before 26 February 1379 Trail had been appointed auditor of the sacred apostolic palace, and between 25 June and 31 October 1383 he became a referendary in the papal chancery. As a result of his services he obtained a number of papal grants to benefices in his native Scotland, although many of these were never realized.<br>
<br>On 29 November 1385, shortly after the death of William Landel, Trail was papally provided (at Avignon) to the see of St Andrews. The cathedral chapter had elected the prior of St Andrews, Stephen Pa, as Landel's successor, but Pa was captured by English pirates on his way to seek papal confirmation of his election and died in captivity at Alnwick on 2 March 1386. Trail appears to have been consecrated as bishop between 27 January and 15 February 1386. He continued to enjoy considerable papal favour, including a grant of the right to judge first appeals from Scottish diocesan courts to the papacy. In addition, before 1 December 1394, he was appointed papal collector in Scotland.<br>
<br>Trail drew praise from the near contemporary chroniclers Andrew Wyntoun and Walter Bower for his high moral standards and for his role in the governance of the kingdom. Bower describes him as &#145;a very solid pillar of the church, a vehicle for eloquence, a repository of knowledge and defender of the church&#146;  (Bower, 8.37). From about October 1387 he became a regular witness to royal charters under the great seal and, as the premier Scottish bishop, took the leading role in public ceremonies such as the funeral of Robert II and the coronation of his successor, Robert III, in August 1390. Trail was also active as a diplomat, visiting the French court in 1391&#150;2 and taking part in Anglo-Scottish truce negotiations during the 1390s. He may have played a significant role in the easing of strained relations within the royal dynasty in the 1390s. His death in 1401, combined with the near simultaneous demise of Queen Annabella and Archibald, third earl of Douglas, was held to be responsible for the outbreak of hostilities between Robert, duke of Albany, and his nephew David, duke of Rothesay, in 1401&#150;2. Bower asserts that with the deaths of Trail, Annabella, and Douglas &#145;dignity departed, honour withdrew and the integrity of Scotland died away&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Apart from his role in the political and social life of the kingdom, Trail was said to have been an active and severe diocesan bishop, and to have been responsible for the building of the episcopal castle in St Andrews. He is last recorded on 5 March 1401, as a witness to a royal charter, and was certainly dead by 1 July 1401 when the St Andrews Cathedral chapter met to elect his successor. According to Bower, Trail was buried close to the high altar of St Andrews Cathedral.<br>
