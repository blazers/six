<span class="headword">Green,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1473), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son and heir of John Green of Widdington, Essex, and his wife, Agnes Duke. Having inherited no more than a small estate in north Essex, he advanced himself through his profession and by marriage. It is said that he was raised in the household of Thomas Rolfe (<i>d</i>. 1440), a serjeant-at-law of that county who perhaps sponsored his entry to Gray's Inn. In the late 1440s he began serving as a JP and commissioner in Essex, and between mid-1450 and the following spring he married Edith (<i>d</i>. 1497), the elder of Rolfe's two daughters and heirs. Born about 1416 and the widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69028/', "John Helion (d. 1449)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54507/', "Helion family")</script>], she brought him an estate in north-west Essex, including Gosfield, the manor where she and Green took up residence. As Helion's widow, Edith also possessed a temporary interest in lands in Essex, Derbyshire, and Suffolk, but the heirs to these were the two daughters of her first marriage.<br>
<br>Like Helion, Green was a tenant and follower of Henry Bourchier, Viscount Bourchier, whom he served as a legal adviser and feoffee. He also performed similar services for prominent gentry from Essex and elsewhere, and he was retained for his counsel by the duchy of Lancaster, the corporation of London, and Thomas Kemp, bishop of London. It is likely that Bourchier supported Green's election to the parliament of 1455 as one of the knights of the shire for Essex. The parliament met after the Yorkist victory at the battle of St Albans, although Bourchier, the newly appointed treasurer of England, had yet to commit himself to the duke of York's cause. During the later 1450s Green continued to serve the Lancastrian crown in local government, and in the same period his brother William was a member of Henry VI's household. Bourchier finally threw in his lot with York after two of his sons were attainted with the duke in the parliament of 1459. He fought for the Yorkists at Northampton on 10 July 1460, and he was again appointed treasurer immediately afterwards. Following his patron's lead, Green also went over to the Yorkists, and in the autumn of the same year he was elected an MP for Essex for the second time. His election as speaker in the parliament of 1460 probably owed much to Bourchier's influence, since he was one of the least distinguished men to hold the office in the fifteenth century. He was nevertheless speaker in a particularly momentous parliament, for the assembly recognized York as the king's heir. During the parliament he and Bourchier were appointed to the committee that held various duchy of Lancaster estates to the use of Henry VI's will.<br>
<br>After Edward IV's accession Bourchier was created earl of Essex, and Green also flourished under the first Yorkist king. In early 1462 he and his brother were granted the stewardship of the estates that John de Vere, twelfth earl of Oxford, recently executed for treason, had held in Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Suffolk. Six years later, in February 1467, he attended a meeting of the king's council, and in 1469 he was appointed deputy to the chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster, Richard Neville, sixteenth earl of Warwick. Bourchier was briefly placed under arrest when Henry VI was restored to the throne in late 1470, but the pliable Green remained a JP, just as he did after Edward IV returned from exile in the following spring.<br>
<br>Green died on 1 May 1473. He was buried in the parish church at Gosfield, where a matrix of his brass remains. His widow, who survived until 1 June 1497, was buried beside her first husband in the church of Leighs Priory, Essex. Green's heirs were his daughters Agnes and Margaret, who respectively married the Essex landowners Sir William Fynderne and Sir Henry Tey. A third daughter became abbess of Dartford, Kent.<br>
