<span class="headword">Pigg,  Oliver</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1550, <em>d.</em> in or after 1591), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, came from an extended family of that name in and around Colchester, Essex. He was perhaps the son of Oliver Pigg, tailor, found in the parish of St Nicholas in 1563. Another man of these names, rector of All Saints' from June 1569, had relinquished the cure by 17 October 1571, but &#145;Oliver Pigg, vicar of St Peter&#146; (1569&#150;79), is a creation of Richard Newcourt, who substituted his name for that found in the episcopal register, John Clyatt.<br>
<br>Pigg matriculated pensioner from St John's College, Cambridge, on 6 October 1565, was made scholar on 8 November 1566, and graduated BA early in 1570. Ordained deacon by William Downham, bishop of Chester, on 5 March 1571, he was the following day instituted rector of Abberton, near Colchester, on the presentation of Katherine Audley.<br>
<br>Pigg resigned Abberton no later than 2 December 1578, and about 1580 took charge of the parish of Rougham, Suffolk, on behalf of its absentee rector, William Tay, who was also rector of Peldon, Essex, and a founder member of the conference of dissident clergymen known as the Dedham classis. Tay seems to have ceded him all, or most, of the tithes. Pigg's nonconformity aroused the animosity of the patron, Robert Drury, who had the backing of Edmund Freake, bishop of Norwich. When Freake suspended Pigg in May 1581 Drury seized the opportunity to withhold his tithes. The privy council sided unequivocally with Pigg and when Freake refused to restore him went so far as to examine him themselves. They found in his favour, frankly informing Freake that the proceedings against him resulted from malice. This, and their rigorous pursuit of Drury, seem to have been enough to secure Pigg's restoration.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A comfortable treatise upon the latter part of the fourth chapiter of the first epistle of Saint Peter</span> was dated at London on 6 April 1582. Pigg had perhaps come to the capital to consult with John Field, organizing secretary of the clerical conference movement, for on 16 May following he reported to Field that sixty ministers from Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Essex had the previous week met secretly at Cockfield, Suffolk, where John Knewstub was rector, to discuss how far the prayer book should be tolerated for the future. This meeting may have represented a significant advance in Field's attempts to co-ordinate nonconformist activity throughout the home counties and thereafter to press for ecclesiastical reform by parliamentary means.<br>
<br>Pigg practised what he preached and in February 1583 Robert Drury brought a suit against William Tay for permitting his curate's liturgical irregularities, again withholding the tithes. In July Pigg was duly imprisoned at Bury St Edmunds for altering the baptism service. Since in a petition for release to the Bury justices he declared his detestation of the doctrines of Robert Browne and Robert Harrison, it would seem that Drury had accused him of separatist beliefs. Pigg sent a copy of his petition to Francis Walsingham, with a covering letter complaining of the justices' severity in refusing him bail, and requesting another hearing before the privy council.<br>
<br>Although none is recorded Pigg's appeal was evidently successful for, while Drury ensured that he did not return to Rougham, he was in 1584 among the Suffolk ministers who refused to subscribe to Archbishop Whitgift's three articles, newly introduced as his yardstick of conformity. This refusal perhaps spelt the end of Pigg's public ministry in Suffolk, and of the privy council's ability to protect him, for he seems to have briefly become chaplain to Sir Dru Drury, thereafter departing for Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Pigg was evidently one of those upon whom John Field relied in co-ordinating the conference movement. In 1587 he and William Dyke were the Hertfordshire delegates to a synod held in Cambridge and it was presumably about this time that the French church in London solicited them &#145;and the rest of the brethren in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire&#146; for financial relief  (Peel, 1.156). In April 1589, when his preaching caused contention in Dorchester, Pigg again engaged the government's sympathy on his behalf. That year he published <span class="italic">Meditations concerning praiers to Almighte God, for the saftie of england, when the Spaniards were come into the narrow seas, August 1588</span>, which advocated the annual observance of armada day. <span class="italic">Sermons upon the 101. psalme, conteyning profitable instruction for all, especially for such as have any governement over others</span> appeared in 1591 and since no more is known of Pigg's activities he probably died shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>As his frequent recourse to the privy council suggests, Pigg's radicalism never gave the central government any real cause for alarm. He seems to have been valued more for his preaching than distrusted for his activities as one of Field's most constant supporters.<br>
