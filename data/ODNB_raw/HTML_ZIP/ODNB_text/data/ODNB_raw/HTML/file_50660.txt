<span class="headword">Quig,  Alexander Johnstone</span>  (1892&#150;1962), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 5 January 1892 in Glasgow, the son of Alexander Quig, mechanical engineer. He was educated at Glasgow high school, leaving in 1908 at the age of sixteen to go into Nobel's Explosives Company Ltd. During the First World War he joined first the Glasgow highlanders and London Scottish regiments to serve in France, followed by a period in India with the Highland light infantry. After five years' service he rejoined Nobel's, which later expanded into Nobel Industries Ltd. In 1925 Quig transferred to Nobel Chemical Finishes Ltd, a company jointly owned with Du Pont, and rose rapidly from general manager to managing director; in 1936 he became chairman. In 1926 Nobel Industries Ltd was one of the four major chemical companies in Britain which merged to form the giant Imperial Chemical Industries.<br>
<br>Quig's managerial experience stood him in good stead and at the beginning of 1939 he was made one of five new executive managers of ICI in a reorganization aimed at alleviating the workload of the hard-pressed board of directors. A year later he joined the full board as commercial director. He was instrumental in moving ICI away from the defensive alliances&#151;such as that with Distillers&#151;which had made it more secure but at the same time limited its scope in the 1930s, and proved himself more forceful and commercially aggressive than other ICI directors. By 1948, he was one of three deputy chairmen, from which position he retired in 1956.<br>
<br>Quig's background in the cut and thrust environment of the paints and lacquers industry had provided him with ample opportunity to develop a shrewd commercial expertise and in 1944 he was made a director of British Nylon Spinners Ltd, a company jointly set up in 1940 by ICI and Courtaulds. He was largely responsible for the development of BNS and the establishment during the late 1940s of spinning factories near Pontypool in Wales and close to ICI's Billingham works on Teesside. Quig felt that ICI's group chairmen tended to be involved in the chemical and technical aspects of their various businesses at the expense of the commercial side. He strongly backed the creation, after the Second World War, of a staff college for the training of incoming managerial staff.<br>
<br>Quig's reputation for expert management, developed during his Nobel and ICI years, was recognized outside the industry. He acted as chairman of the Industrial Management Research Association from 1946 to 1949, as well as being one of the founder members of the British Institute of Management. In 1948&#150;9 he acted as chairman of a committee set up by the secretary of state for air to review the structure and management of the Air Ministry. In 1952, four years before his retirement, Quig married Joan Leason, the director of a box-manufacturing company, a widow and the daughter of Ernest Johns, a shipbuilder; they had no children. His Scottish roots were maintained in his membership of the Caledonian Club in London which boasted a large Scottish membership. He was also a member of the East India Club and the Royal Thames Yacht Club.<br>
<br>Quig, who listed farming as one of his hobbies, lived at and managed Combe Farm, near Bramley, Surrey, with its herd of Ayrshire cattle, for many years until his death. He died at the age of seventy in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Marylebone, London, on 13 December 1962, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 18 December.<br>
