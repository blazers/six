<span class="headword">Hinde,  William</span>  (1568/9&#150;1629), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was almost certainly born at Kendal, Westmorland. He was probably educated at Kendal, and on 9 December 1586, aged seventeen, was admitted as a &#145;plebeian&#146; to Queen's College, Oxford. He graduated BA on 2 July 1591 and proceeded MA on 2 July 1594. Subsequently elected a fellow of Queen's, he was ordained some time after 1595. While at Oxford he acquired the godly values that were to dominate his life.<br>
<br>About 1603 Hinde was appointed curate in the parish of Bunbury, Cheshire. In or before 1605 he was married, probably to Margaret, the wife mentioned in his will; she was probably the daughter of William Foxe of Rhodes, near Pilkington, Bury. Another of Foxe's daughters, Anne, was married about this time to the iconoclast John Bruen, whose biography Hinde later wrote. A son, Joseph (himself admitted to Queen's in 1623), was born by early 1606, and in total William and Margaret had nine surviving children. He soon became an active and outspoken puritan minister, participating regularly in teaching exercises within the county and speaking vigorously against popery and recreations on the sabbath. At the same time he maintained contacts with puritans in other areas. In 1614 he published, with John Dod, <span class="italic">Bathshebaes Instructions to her Sonne Lemuel</span>, the work of &#145;a godly and learned man, now with God&#146; sometimes mistakenly attributed to Robert Cleaver. In his editions of two works by John Rainolds, <span class="italic">The Prophecies of Obadiah Opened</span> (1613) and <span class="italic">The Discovery of the Man of Sinne</span> (1614), Hinde held church ceremonies to be matters indifferent and attacked the wealth of the richest clergy.<br>
<br>Increasingly such behaviour brought Hinde into conflict with Bishop Thomas Morton of Chester, and in 1617, following several discussions about church government, he was presented and fined. When in 1618 Morton's relations with his nonconformist clergy were further undermined by the publication of the bishop's <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, Hinde became disillusioned with the episcopate. He devoted the rest of his life to his family and scholarship, although he continued to be presented for nonconformity. His <span class="italic">A Path to Pietie</span> (1613) was followed up by <span class="italic">A Brief and Plaine Catechisme</span> (1623). <span class="italic">The Office and Use of the Moral Law of God</span> (1622), reissued a year later, revealed that he had not lost a taste for controversy. He also completed <span class="italic">A Faithfull Remonstrance of the Holy Life and Happy Death of John Bruen</span>, finally published posthumously by his son Samuel in 1641, but became exhausted by a life of self-sacrifice. Following a short illness, he died at Bunbury in June 1629 and was buried in Bunbury churchyard.<br>
