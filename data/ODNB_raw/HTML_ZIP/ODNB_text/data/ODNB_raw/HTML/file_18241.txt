<span class="headword">Marvell,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1584&#150;1641), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Meldreth in south-west Cambridgeshire, one of the two sons of Andrew Marvell (<i>d</i>. 1628), yeoman, and his wife, Johanne (<i>d</i>. 1615). The family, which had long been settled in the area, farmed some 50 acres of land in the village. Marvell was admitted in 1601 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and elected scholar in 1604, graduating BA in 1605 and proceeding MA in 1608. After entering the diaconate at York in March 1607 he was in November licensed by the bishop of Ely to serve as curate and schoolmaster at Melbourne, adjacent to his birthplace. By January 1609 his signature as curate appears in the register of burials at Flamborough in the East Riding, and he was ordained priest in York Minster on 30 May (Trinity Sunday).<br>
<br>At Cherry Burton near Beverley, on 22 October 1612, Marvell married Anne Pease (<i>d</i>. 1638), whose precise parentage remains unknown though the surname was a local one. On 23 April 1614 he was formally inducted as rector of Winestead in Holderness, a parish to the east of Kingston upon Hull, where all his five children were baptized. Of his two sons only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18242/', "Andrew Marvell (1621&#150;1678)")</script>, the poet, reached manhood; John (<i>b</i>. 1623) died on 20 September 1624, ten days before the corporation of Hull appointed Marvell lecturer at Holy Trinity Church. Shortly afterwards he obtained the mastership of the Charterhouse Hospital, outside the north walls, which became his home. There he was joined in 1626 by his father and his brother Edward and family, perhaps fleeing the plague or Charles I's forced loan. In due course his daughters became the wives of Hull townsmen, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1615) marrying James Blaydes in 1633, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1617) marrying Edmund Popple in 1636, and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1618) marrying Robert More by 1642.<br>
<br>During Marvell's stewardship of the Charterhouse the number of almspeople was increased, the fabric and chapel were extensively repaired, and annual accounts faithfully rendered. Otherwise, according to his son, he &#145;lived with some measure of reputation, both for Piety and Learning: and he was moreover a Conformist to the established Rites of the Church of <i>England</i>, though I confess none of the most over-running or eager in them&#146;  (Marvell, <span class="italic">Rehearsal</span>, pt 2, 128). It is true that early on he fell out with the vicar of Hull about preaching, and as late as 1639 was ordered by the diocese to read, in hood and surplice, more of the prayer book liturgy before his weekly lecture. Yet some autograph complaints against local separatists (manuscript in Hull Local History Library) and notes on the necessity of observing church ritual (BL, Harley MS 6356, fols. 197<i>r</i>&#150;197<i>v</i>) indicate only a moderate puritanism.<br>
<br>Thomas Fuller's anecdotal account derives from a son-in-law of Marvell. It portrays him as &#145;most <i>facetious</i> in his <i>discourse</i>, yet <i>grave</i> in his <i>carriage</i>; a most excellent preacher, who, like a good husband, never <i>broached</i> what he had new <i>brewed</i>, but preached what he had pre-studied some competent time before&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 159). Several of his sermons survive in manuscript. Besides those still preserved in Hull, &#145;Israel and England parallel'd&#146; (London, Inner Temple Library) was dedicated in 1627 to Anne Sadleir of Standon, Hertfordshire, sister of his traditional benefactor Bridget Skinner of Thornton Curtis, Lincolnshire. A copy of the address which, although himself recently under quarantine from the plague, he delivered at the funeral of John Ramsden, mayor of Hull, on 8 December 1637 survives in BL, Harley MS 6356, fols. 153&#150;62. He corresponded on theological matters with brother ministers (for example BL, Lansdowne MS 891, fol. 118), sometimes acrimoniously, while Fuller mentions that his &#145;excellent comment upon Saint <i>Peter</i> is daily desired and expected&#146;.<br>
<br>Marvell's first wife died in 1638 and was buried at Holy Trinity on 28 April. On 27 November of the same year he married, at Norton in Derbyshire, Lucy (1592&#150;1664), widow of William Harris, by birth a member of the Alured family who were Marvell's neighbours at the Charterhouse; he was her third husband. The merchants and civic authorities of Hull continued to show their appreciation of his services by gifts and bequests until his death by drowning on 23 January 1641, in a <i>&#145;Barrow-boat&#146;</i> that became <i>&#145;sand-warpt&#146;</i> while crossing the Humber. His sole contemporary memorial is an anonymous verse-elegy jotted into the parish register of Pickering, North Riding of Yorkshire.<br>
