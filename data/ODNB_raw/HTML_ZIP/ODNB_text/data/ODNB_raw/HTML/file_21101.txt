<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1771&#150;1840), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, third and most distinguished of the six sons of Henry Bayly Paget, first earl of Uxbridge of the second creation, and his wife, Jane, eldest daughter of the Very Revd Arthur Champagne, dean of Clonmacnoise, was born on 15 January 1771. He was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21112/', "Henry William Paget")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21106/', "Edward Paget")</script>. He entered Westminster School on 10 April 1780 and was elected to the foundation in 1783. From there he went to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 8 June 1787; he took no degree but established a close relationship with Dean Cyril Jackson. In 1791 he entered the diplomatic service, and on 22 November 1794 he was returned to parliament for Anglesey, which he continued nominally to represent until 1807. Paget was a man of easy charm who made his way with little difficulty up the diplomatic ladder, assisted by his moderate whiggery. On the abandonment by Prussia of the defence of Holland, in July 1794, he was dispatched to Berlin as envoy-extraordinary to remind King Frederick William of his obligations. His conduct of this delicate mission was commended by Lord Malmesbury. Obtaining no satisfactory assurances from the king, he withdrew to Pyrmont about Christmas, and, when the French crossed the Waal, he returned to England by way of Brunswick and Holland. Some letters from him to the countess of Lichtenau written during this dangerous journey, in which, as a last resort, he implores her to use her influence with the king on behalf of the Dutch, are printed in <span class="italic">Apologie der Gr&auml;fin von Lichtenau</span> (2 vols., 1808).<br>
<br>Paget was accredited envoy-extraordinary to the elector palatine and minister to the diet of Regensburg on 22 May 1798. He was appointed envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to the court of Naples on 17 January 1800, and to that of Vienna on 21 August 1801, where his extravagance gained him the nickname &#145;The Emperor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paget Papers</span>, 1.xiii). His dispatches from Vienna in July 1802, after Napoleon's reorganization of the smaller German states, contained a remarkable prediction of the eventual acquisition by Prussia of the hegemony of Germany. In 1805 he contributed materially to the formation of the third coalition against France, and reported its total discomfiture by the battle of Austerlitz, on 2 December 1805. His gloomy dispatch on the day after the battle is said to have contributed to the death of Pitt. Recalled in February 1806, he was accredited, on 15 May 1807, ambassador to the Ottoman Porte. On the signature of the treaty of Tilsit on 7 July following, he told the sultan of the secret article by which the provisions in favour of Turkey were rendered nugatory, and exhausted the resources of persuasion and threat, even bringing the British fleet into the Dardanelles, in an attempt to detach the Porte from the French alliance. In this, however, he failed. In May 1809 he was recalled, and retired on a pension of &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Paget was sworn of the privy council on 4 January 1804, and was nominated KB on 21 May following. On 18 May 1808 he eloped with Augusta Jane Parker, Lady Boringdon (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fane), second daughter of John, tenth earl of Westmorland, causing considerable scandal. He married her on 16 February 1809, two days after her divorce from John, second Baron Boringdon, afterwards earl of Morley. With her he had several children who survived him, one of whom was the diplomatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21102/', "Sir Augustus Berkeley Paget")</script>. He spent his retirement years as an agriculturalist and yachtsman. He was made GCB in January 1815. Paget died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, on 26 July 1840 and was buried on 1 August in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
