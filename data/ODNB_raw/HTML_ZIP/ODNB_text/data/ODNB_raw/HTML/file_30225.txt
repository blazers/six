<span class="headword">Yonge,  James</span>  (1647&#150;1721), <span class="occ">surgeon and physician</span>, the son of John Yonge (<i>d</i>. 1679), surgeon, and his wife, Joanna (1618&#150;1700), daughter of Nicholas Blackaller of Sharpham, Devon, was born at Plymouth on 27 February 1647 and was baptized at St Andrew's &#145;in the Presbyterian district&#146; of Plymouth on 11 March that year. Able to read and write, at the age of nine he was sent to the Latin school where he was educated under Mr Horsman.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1658 Yonge was apprenticed to Silvester Richmond, surgeon of the <i>Constant Warwick</i>. He was appointed surgeon's mate to the <i>Montague</i> in 1660 and was present at the bombardment of Algiers in 1662. On his return to England, Yonge was paid off and worked for four months as assistant to an apothecary in Wapping. When Richmond retired Yonge was bound to his father and assisted him until February 1663 when he was sent on a voyage with the <i>Reformation</i> to the cod fisheries in Newfoundland. In February 1664 he joined the <i>Robert Bonadventure</i> as surgeon, visiting west Africa and the Mediterranean. On his second voyage with the ship in December 1665 he was captured by the Dutch and was held as a prisoner of war in Amsterdam until September 1666. Yonge returned to Plymouth where he practised until February 1668, at which time he made a final trip to Newfoundland.<br>
<br>Yonge settled in Plymouth on his return and eventually built a successful practice. On 28 March 1671 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1708), daughter of Thomas Crampporne of Buckland Monachorum, Devon; they had three sons and five daughters. Their eldest son, John (1672&#150;1745), was great-grandfather of Charles Duke Yonge (1812&#150;1891). James Yonge became surgeon to the naval hospital at Plymouth and in 1674 was appointed deputy surgeon-general to the navy, &#145;an office which brought him no inconsiderable accession of emolument&#146;  (Munk, 3). He went on to publish papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on a bullet in the trachea, gallstones, and on an intestinal concretion. In 1678 Yonge paid a visit to London, during which he met many of the notable figures of the day. The visit led him to write <span class="italic">Currus triumphalis e terebintho</span>, two letters on the use of turpentine to control haemorrhage. In 1682 he published <span class="italic">Wounds of the Brain Proved Curable</span>.<br>
<br>Yonge, who was a royalist and then a tory, became an influential citizen of Plymouth: he was elected a member of the common council for the borough in 1679, churchwarden of St Andrew's in 1682, and alderman and mayor of Plymouth in 1694. From 1685 to 1689 he was surgeon to Lord Bath's regiment of militia. Yonge made a further visit to London in 1692 after his appointment as surgeon to the new dock at Hamoaze. The trip gave him the opportunity to hear Edward Tyson lecture and to be made a member of the Company of Surgeons.<br>
<br>In 1702 Yonge became an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, although he had already been licensed to practise by the bishop of Exeter. He was elected FRS on 3 November 1702. He retired from practice the next year, although he did undertake the embalming of Sir Cloudesley Shovell's body in 1707.<br>
<br>Yonge's journal, detailing his professional activities and family affairs, was published in 1963. He also wrote on trade with Newfoundland and on the <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>. Yonge died on 25 July 1721 and was buried in St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, where a monument was erected to his memory.<br>
