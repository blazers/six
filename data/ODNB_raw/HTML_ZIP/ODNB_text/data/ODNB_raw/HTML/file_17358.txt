<span class="headword">Mac Br&aacute;daigh,  Fiachra</span>  (<em>c.</em>1690&#150;<em>c.</em>1760), <span class="occ">poet and scribe</span>, may have been born in the townland of Drumgallon in the parish of Drung, co. Cavan, where he later lived. He taught in a &#145;hedge school&#146; in Stradone in the nearby parish of Laragh, and was dubbed &#145;a witty schoolmaster&#146; and &#145;a tolerably good poet&#146;  (O'Reilly, ccx). Some half-dozen of his poems are extant, three of them in his own hand. The titles, or opening lines, of three others are known but they appear not to have survived. Mac Br&aacute;daigh's most celebrated compositions are his &#145;Aisling&#146; (&#145;Vision poem&#146;), his &#145;Faoistin&#146; (&#145;Confession&#146;), and his &#145;Seachr&aacute;n&#146; (a humorous account of his wanderings, including a journey to Dublin). The first and last of these appeared in print within a generation of his death, in a Dublin magazine, <span class="italic">Anthologia Hibernica</span> (October and December 1793). &#145;The rollicking drollery of his verses&#146; has been remarked on, as has the fact that &#145;he puts the stamp of his locality and of his own individuality on his compositions&#146;  (&Oacute; M&oacute;rdha, 6).<br>
<br>Mac Br&aacute;daigh's scribal work survives in a manuscript in the British Library (MS Egerton 135) and, indirectly, in a manuscript in the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. The former contains three of his own poems and some genealogical material addressed to three friends who may well have been former pupils from his school in Stradone. Two of them were working as clerks in the Dublin Linen Hall and the third may also have been resident in the capital. The material in Mac Br&aacute;daigh's hand, dated September 1755, appears to have been intended as a rough draft; in a note he asks Muiris &Oacute; Gorm&aacute;in, the celebrated south Ulster scribe, then based in Dublin, to rewrite it &#145;with good ink and plaine writing&#146;  (&Oacute; M&oacute;rdha, 13). The Royal Irish Academy manuscript is a careful early nineteenth-century copy, penned in co. Cork, of an interesting collection of early modern Irish prose tales and some short pieces of poetry which Mac Br&aacute;daigh compiled in Drumgallon early in 1722. The original, produced for a local gentleman and landholder named Ros Mac C&aacute;ba, or Ross Mac Cabe, of Lappan, also in the parish of Drung, appears to be lost.<br>
<br>The precise date and place of Mac Br&aacute;daigh's death are uncertain. One tradition suggests that he died in his native place, while a conflicting one indicates, enigmatically, that he was buried in Dunsandle, presumably the place of that name in co. Galway. The suggestion, sometimes made, that Fiachra was a brother to the rather notorious Pilib Mac Br&aacute;daigh (alias Pilib an Minist&eacute;ir or Parson Brady) is without foundation.<br>
