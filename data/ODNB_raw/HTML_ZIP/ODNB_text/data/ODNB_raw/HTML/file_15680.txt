<span class="headword">Kirkup,  Seymour Stocker</span>  (1788&#150;1880), <span class="occ">painter and antiquary</span>, was born in London, the eldest child of Joseph Kirkup, jeweller and diamond merchant. In 1809, after a period of study under John Flaxman, he entered the Royal Academy Schools, where, in 1811, he won a medal for his drawing of Apollo in Raphael's <span class="italic">Parnassus</span>. He admired Flaxman, Henry Fuseli, and J. M. W. Turner as teachers and credited Sir Thomas Lawrence with encouraging him to paint portraits. Through one fellow student, Charles Eastlake, he met B. R. Haydon; through another, he met William Blake. He learned early to value association with remarkable personages, preferably not tories.<br>
<br>In 1816, troubled by signs of pulmonary weakness, Kirkup travelled to Italy, planning to stay six months. He lived there for the rest of his long life. At Rome he joined his friend Eastlake in drawing at the English Academy. In November 1820 Joseph Severn and John Keats arrived, bearing a letter to Kirkup from Charles Armitage Brown. In bed with a fever, Kirkup missed Keats's funeral in February 1821 but showed unremitting kindness to Severn. The generous Kirkup, Severn understood, had a small fortune. Kirkup made a good appearance, though just over 5 feet tall (Keats's size, Severn remarked); and he talked engagingly about all the arts. At the interment of Shelley's ashes in January 1823, he met the adventurer E. J. Trelawny, whom he later painted against a background showing the entrance to a cave on Mount Parnassus wearing Suliote dress, including a turban and large red sash, into the top of which an ataghan and knife are thrust.<br>
<br>In 1824, after a severe illness, Kirkup visited Florence. Captivated, he lived there for forty-eight years. For a time he shared quarters near the duomo with Charles Brown, who became acquainted with Kirkup's three successive mistresses; but then he settled in spacious apartments near the south-west corner of the Ponte Vecchio. His circle of Anglo-Florentine friends included W. S. Landor, Robert and Elizabeth Browning, and T. A. Trollope. Among visiting acquaintances were William Hazlitt and Nathaniel Hawthorne. According to Leigh Hunt, Kirkup had too much money and not enough accomplishment to succeed as a painter; but he sent a <span class="italic">Cassio</span> to the Royal Academy (exh. 1833) and painted portraits of Rose Aylmer's half-sister, A. H. Layard's mother, and A. C. Swinburne's mother.<br>
<br>Work on illustrations for Lord Vernon's edition of Dante's works made Kirkup an ardent Dantophile. He became a disciple of Professor Gabriele Rossetti, the leading Dantean in London; and in 1840, with G. A. Bezzi, a Piedmontese, and R. H. Wilde, an American, he employed a restorer to search for Giotto's portrait of Dante in the chapel of the Palazzo del Podest&agrave;, or Bargello. The portrait, known to Vasari, had been covered with whitewash; it was uncovered on 21 July 1840. Not without difficulty, Kirkup made a tracing and, in his copy of the <span class="italic">Convivio</span>, a coloured sketch. He sent a copy of the tracing and a small watercolour sketch to Professor Rossetti, whose elder son, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, painted a watercolour, <span class="italic">Giotto Painting Dante's Portrait</span> (1852). For Vernon, Kirkup made, from the tracing and the coloured sketch in the <span class="italic">Convivio</span>, the drawing on which Vincent Brooks based the chromolithograph published by the Arundel Society in 1859.<br>
<br>Kirkup, who believed in spirits, convinced himself in 1854 that his housekeeper's beautiful daughter, Regina Ronti, possessed mediumistic talents: she saw Dante in the room, looking like a life-mask prized by Kirkup but subsequently discredited. Only seventeen in 1854, Regina bore a daughter, Imogen or Bibi. Though mystified by this event, Kirkup accepted in 1856 Regina's deathbed asseveration that the child was his. Bibi at two, according to Kirkup, manifested her own ability to call up spirits, including Dante's. On the occasion of Dante's 600th birthday in 1865, when Kirkup received a knighthood in the order of Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro, Victor Emmanuel addressed him (inadvertently, it was said) not as <i>cavaliere</i> but as <i>barone</i>&#151;which title Kirkup adopted. He owed the honour, he informed Swinburne, to Dante; and in 1866 Bibi reported confirmation by Dante himself. Even loyal friends deplored Kirkup's over-credulousness.<br>
<br>Kirkup at eighty, pallid, white-bearded, slovenly, very deaf, seldom emerged from his litter of manuscripts, early printed books, and miscellaneous treasures&#151;his life-mask of Dante, a portrait of Savonarola, a carved chest once owned by Machiavelli, a crystal ball, a faded puppet show enjoyed by Bibi and her playmate Paolina Carboni. Then <i>gli spiriti</i> advised the <i>barone</i> to sell all his possessions and move to Leghorn. The sale at Sothebys in December 1871 fetched only &pound;2555 for 4194 lots. At Leghorn, Bibi had a suitor; she married him and died at twenty-five. At eighty-seven, on 16 February 1875, Kirkup married Paolina Carboni, then twenty-two. They resided at via Scali del Ponte Nuovo 4, Leghorn, where he died on 3 January 1880. He was buried on 5 January in the British cemetery, Leghorn.<br>
