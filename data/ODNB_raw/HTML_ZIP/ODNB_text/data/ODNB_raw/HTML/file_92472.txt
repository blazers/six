<span class="headword">Marie-Am&eacute;lie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span>  (1782&#150;1866), <span class="occ">queen of the French and exile</span>, was born at Caserta, near Naples, on 26 April 1782, the daughter of Ferdinand IV (1751&#150;1825), king of Naples and Sicily, and his wife, Maria Carolina (1752&#150;1814), daughter of Maria Theresa, Holy Roman empress. A pious Catholic, she was in temperament more of a dour Habsburg than a passionate Sicilian.<br>
<br>Marie-Am&eacute;lie's family lived through difficult times in Napoleonic Italy. In June 1808 the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, Louis-Philippe (1773&#150;1850), whose father as Philippe-&Eacute;galit&eacute; had voted for the death of his cousin, Louis XVI, visited Palermo. He was attracted to Marie-Am&eacute;lie, but, himself an exile from France since 1792 and a pensioner of the British government, at first did not think he had anything to offer her. They married in Naples on 25 November 1809. The couple returned to France in April 1814, to retreat again into exile a year later during Napoleon's hundred days.<br>
<br>At the second restoration in 1815 the Orl&eacute;ans re-established themselves in the family home, the Palais Royal, and restored it to its former glory. It was an unusual royal palace, being a highly commercial establishment. Louis-Philippe's father had originally turned a large section of the buildings into fashionable shops, theatres, and caf&eacute;s. Louis-Philippe continued the tradition. He quickly resurrected the family fortunes, aided by his wife's careful management, to become the richest man in France, before he became the biggest recipient of compensation paid to &eacute;migr&eacute;s in 1825. The duke and duchess of Orl&eacute;ans were ostentatiously the most loyal supporters of the restored monarchy, always at Charles X's side on public occasions, as befitted a couple who, until the birth of the duke of Bordeaux, six months after the assassination of the duke of Berry in 1820, stood to inherit the throne. The Orl&eacute;ans effectively held a rival court, egged on by liberal opponents of the Bourbons, and towards 1830 a substantial &#145;reversionary&#146; interest developed in the press.<br>
<br>In August 1830 Marie-Am&eacute;lie became a very reluctant queen of the French people, having initially tried to encourage her husband to serve as regent for the duke of Bordeaux, regarded by legitimists as Henri V following the abdication of his grandfather Charles X. She was appalled by the revolution of that year, describing the bench in the gardens at Neuilly (their country house) where Thiers persuaded her husband to accept the throne as &#145;the tomb of my happiness&#146;. She devoted herself to her five sons and three daughters. Louis-Philippe worked hard to marry them into other royal families, while Marie-Am&eacute;lie, a puritanical spirit, concentrated on hushing up her sons' sexual exploits. She organized her daughters and daughters-in-law in nightly sewing sessions at a round table, with a special drawer for each lady. At least one chafed at this communal domesticity.<br>
<br>Marie-Am&eacute;lie was devoted to charitable endeavours. She had no sense of politics, and Louis-Philippe turned to his sister, Madame Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de, for advice on public matters. It was she who urged him to accept the throne. Marie-Am&eacute;lie was always very dignified and calm in public, but had to endure several assassination attempts on her husband. The royal couple launched modern monarchy, living a very accessible &#145;bourgeois&#146; existence. Unnecessary formality and uniforms at court were abandoned. Their sons went to the Lyc&eacute;e Henri IV. They took a genuine interest in modernity. Marie-Am&eacute;lie opened the first railway in France in 1837, from Paris to St Germain-en-Laye. To encourage people to meet them, they travelled around the country with their family, first in a large carriage, later by rail. They took advantage of rail and steam ships to inaugurate royal visits with Queen Victoria. All this must have been achieved by Marie-Am&eacute;lie out of devotion to her husband and with considerable effort. She was naturally withdrawn and also more comfortable with traditional monarchical distance and formality than her husband.<br>
<br>When political upheaval hit Paris again on 23 February 1848, Marie-Am&eacute;lie urged her husband to resist. Along with their youngest son, Montpensier, she advised him to dismiss the Guizot government, and next day she pressed them to appear in public and review the national guard, units of which were in revolt. She kept her courage, but Louis-Philippe had lost his and agreed, to his wife's anger, to abdicate. &#145;You are ungrateful, you do not deserve such a good king&#146;, she flung at Thiers, as they left for St Cloud  (Mansel, 403). Without the time to take money, papers, or outdoor clothes they raced for the channel, sailing from Dieppe to Newhaven as Mr and Mrs Smith, where they arrived on 3 March 1848.<br>
<br>Most of their family joined them, including Montpensier and his pregnant wife. Louis-Philippe spoke fluent English. He had lived at Highshot House, Twickenham, between 1800 and 1807, and the family settled at Claremont House, near Esher, Surrey, which Queen Victoria had made available to their daughter Louise-Marie (1812&#150;1850) and her husband, Leopold I, king of the Belgians, and which the latter couple rarely used. The Orl&eacute;ans were transformed into the count and countess of Neuilly. <span class="italic">The Times</span> commented on &#145;the plain and unostentatious manner in which the household of the illustrious exiles is ordered, the most rigid economy being observed in all its arrangements&#146;  (3 April 1848, 3). The family, including the duke of Nemours, the duke of Aumale, and the prince and princess of Joinville, visited Queen Victoria on 2 April 1848, shortly after their arrival, but otherwise they lived quietly within the family circle. Louis-Philippe's health failed rapidly. When their grandson and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92473/', "Louis Philippe Albert d'Orl&#233;ans, count of Paris")</script>, received his first communion, Louis-Philippe decided to join the Roman Catholic church, which must have been some consolation to his wife.<br>
<br>After her husband's death at Claremont on 26 August 1850 Marie-Am&eacute;lie tried to reconcile the Bourbon and Orl&eacute;ans families. She also resumed active charitable work, helping convents, orphanages, and Roman Catholic schools. She also helped individual poor Catholics, usually Irish. She travelled in Europe, but made Claremont the focus for frequent family reunions. The duchess of Orl&eacute;ans, despite her dislike of England, settled near her. On the death in 1865 of her son-in-law, Leopold, king of the Belgians, widower of her daughter, Claremont House reverted to the crown but Victoria reassured Marie-Am&eacute;lie that she could remain there. She died at Claremont on 24 March 1866; Victoria visited Claremont on the following day, &#145;pour embrasser un dernier fois mon amie&#146;  (Trognon, 472). Clothed in the black gown which she wore when fleeing France in 1848, Marie-Am&eacute;lie was buried in the vaults of the Roman Catholic chapel at Weybridge, Surrey, in a tomb next to her husband. In June 1876 their remains were reinterred in the family burial ground at Dreux (Eure-et-Loir).<br>
<br>Both in France and England, Marie-Am&eacute;lie was a shadow. Her granddaughter commented, &#145;De quelle femme, f&ucirc;t-elle reine, a-t-on autant vant&eacute; les qualit&eacute;s d'&eacute;pouse et de m&egrave;re, tous les jugements des historiographes de la monarchie de juillet concordent parfaitement sur ce point&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal de Marie-Am&eacute;lie</span>, preface). Very little has been written about her and, in contrast to the other exiled French consort, Eug&eacute;nie Bonaparte, who arrived in Britain in 1870, the British press barely noticed her presence. Another mystery is why the Orl&eacute;ans lived so frugally in exile in borrowed property, a sharp contrast to the opulent life-style of Eug&eacute;nie. The second republic did not confiscate their lands, but did it block access to the income from them? What is certain is that thanks to Louis-Philippe and Marie-Am&eacute;lie's careful stewardship the Orl&eacute;ans remained the biggest landowners in France until the 1960s.<br>
<br>Alexander Bryulov's portrait of Marie-Am&eacute;lie, probably executed shortly after Louis-Philippe's death (she is depicted in mourning) shows her stripped of all the trappings of royalty and wealth with which she was decked in the 1842 painting by Franz Winterhalter, and with no pretence of youth, but showing an agreeable, direct old lady, with a calm inner strength.<br>
