<span class="headword">Mitrany,  David</span>  (1888&#150;1975), <span class="occ">political scientist</span>, was born on 1 January 1888 in Bucharest, the son of Moscu and Jeannette Mitrany. He left Romania in 1908 in search of further education, for in that country opportunities in higher education and in the professions were limited for Jews. He spent three years in Hamburg, working and studying at the Kolonial Institut, University of Hamburg, becoming interested in social projects, before moving to London, where he intended to continue his studies in such work. In 1912 he enrolled at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) to study sociology and economics. The outbreak of the First World War changed Mitrany's outlook and the purpose of his career. From 1914 to 1918 he was involved in diplomatic work with the Romanian legation and in intelligence work for the British Foreign and War offices. He contributed to the series of <span class="roman">Peace Handbooks</span> prepared under the direction of the historical section of the Foreign Office, and became an active member of the first League of Nations Society.<br>
<br>A fortuitous encounter with C. P. Scott, editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, led to a position on its editorial board, with a special responsibility for foreign affairs, which lasted from May 1919 to 1922. Mitrany's relationship with Scott was particularly cordial: Scott had confidence in the accuracy of Mitrany's facts and approved of his political views, which were akin to his own. In 1922 Mitrany became assistant European editor for the publications on the economic and social history of the war that were financed by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. This experience was to form the basis for the development of his ideas, through working with authors from many countries and acquiring a detailed knowledge of post-war problems, such as sanctions, minorities, nationalism, and land disputes. On 9 June 1923 he married Ena Victoria Limebeer (1897/8&#150;1986), writer and artist, and they moved to Kingston Blount, Oxfordshire, which was to be Mitrany's home for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>During this period Mitrany determined his role in the international political scene. His purpose was to work towards the development of effective peace organizations, and in so doing he was resolute in maintaining a personal neutrality. He would not accept membership of any political party, nor would he participate in any organization which was nationalist or religious. This was his strength, but it was to isolate him from the main stream of political scientists. He also found time to conclude his academic studies at LSE: he became BSc (Econ) (war) (1918), followed by PhD (1929), and DSc in economics (1931).<br>
<br>Through Mitrany's work for the Carnegie Endowment came invitations during 1931&#150;3 to Harvard University and to present the Dodge lectures at Yale University. In these lectures, published as <span class="italic">The Progress of International Government</span> (1933), he first outlined his functional ideas. Recognition of his academic standing and of his knowledge of European affairs followed, with the appointment in 1933 as professor in the School of Economics and Politics at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University. His was the first appointment in the school and the only non-American, and gave him a status in American academic life which he was to lack in the UK. Working in the USA during the depression studying Roosevelt's new deal strengthened his belief in functional solutions.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Mitrany became a member of the Foreign Office's academic intelligence unit, the foreign research and press service, based at Balliol College, Oxford. Mitrany produced a series of innovative documents, and as early as June 1941 was setting out an &#145;Agenda of peace making&#146;. In another paper, &#145;Territorial, ideological, or functional organization?&#146;, he expanded his own ideas, and at the end of 1942 he resigned to pursue these further. The results appeared in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Working Peace System</span> (1943), which had an immediate public appeal and was translated into various languages. Mitrany embarked on an extensive programme of lecturing, broadcasting, and writing, with the aim of ensuring that a new peace organization would not be handicapped by a rigid constitution (as had the League of Nations) but would be given the capacity to develop on functional and sociological lines. The validity of the functional approach was accepted and incorporated in the founding documents of the specialized agencies of the new United Nations. Mitrany, in a new edition of his pamphlet in 1946, in analysing the new organization, stressed the importance of its functions in social and economic spheres.<br>
<br>In 1945 Mitrany was invited by the multinational company Unilever to act as its adviser on international affairs. He accepted the position, as an experiment and a challenge, acknowledging that, with an invalid wife, he was thus given the freedom to stay in the UK and to continue with his academic role at Princeton. The experiment was to continue to his retirement in 1960. His next substantial work was very different, and was based on his experiences with the Carnegie Endowment, on his knowledge of eastern Europe, and his accumulated research material: <span class="italic">Marx Against the Peasant: a Study in Social Dogmatism</span> was published in 1951. The book was examined worldwide, translated into European and Asian languages, and received much praise and abuse, though even left-wing critics acknowledged the depth and accuracy of its scholarship.<br>
<br>Mitrany continued to write and lecture on international politics and functionalism and to probe new ideas in a society where economics and politics were increasingly entwined. He gave up his professorship at Princeton and became a permanent member, with access to the institute, while undertaking extensive university lectures in the USA. In the 1960s there was new interest in functionalism as the organizations of the European Union came into being. Mitrany, although not an advocate of regionalism, which he believed stifled true internationalism, welcomed the functional solutions put forward. The increased interest resulted in the publication of a collection of his writings in 1966, including the text of the original pamphlet. At a conference devoted to functionalism in 1969 he presented the introductory paper, which was published, with a further collection of his writings, in 1975 as <span class="italic">The Functional Theory of Politics</span>. This included an autobiographical account of how his functional approach to international government had developed. David Mitrany died in London on 25 July 1975, and was cremated at Golders Green on 29 July.<br>
<br>In its essence the &#145;Mitranian&#146; approach is simple and pragmatic: to work with and for people; to co-operate on issues that unite not divide; to allow the &#145;form&#146; of a solution to follow its &#145;functions&#146;. Functionalism is the reflection of David Mitrany himself, a man of vision and simplicity, compassion and tolerance, a scholar who, aware of the past, looked to develop a future world community.<br>
