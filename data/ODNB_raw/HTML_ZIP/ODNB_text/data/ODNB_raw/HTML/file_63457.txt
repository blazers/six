<span class="headword">Miller,  Walter Richard Samuel</span>  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 22 March 1872 at Brook Hill, Honiton, Devon, the only son in the family of eight children of a respected merchant, Walter John Miller, and his wife, Jane Walker Sellers. His parents moved to Bristol in 1881 and after attending several private schools, Miller went to St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in 1890, graduating MRCS and LRCP in 1896. Although a devoted Christian, he was not a mainstream Anglican. In childhood he was influenced by the Plymouth Brethren and later in life he inclined towards the Society of Friends and Moral Re-Armament. At medical school he played an active role in the Student Christian Movement. After qualifying he became travelling secretary for the Student Volunteer Missionary Union for a year. He worked in the Princess Christian Hospital at Freetown, Sierra Leone, for a short time before studying Hausa at Tripoli in Libya. He sailed to Nigeria as a Church Missionary Society missionary at the end of 1899.<br>
<br>From Lagos, along with Bishop Herbert Tugwell and three other missionaries, Miller began a long journey to Kano while Frederick Lugard was preparing to subdue the unsettled protectorate of Northern Nigeria. In the event, the emir of Kano would not allow them to stay there, and Lugard was reluctant to let them establish a base until the country was pacified. Miller had several temporary camps until in 1905 he was allowed to settle in Zaria city, where he lived until 1929. This was the only mission allowed within a Muslim town in Northern Nigeria. Miller gave priority to developing a school rather than a hospital. For many years it was the best in Northern Nigeria and its pupils included the first two Hausa doctors, one of whom, Dr R. A. B. Dikko, became minister of health in the 1960s. Miller's sister Ethel came out in 1907 and together with other female missionaries started to provide education for Nigerian girls. A Hausa scholar in her own right, Ethel was unorthodox and individualistic and left to become a freelance evangelist. One significant event for Miller was the visit of some Isawa. These were scattered groups of Hausa who lived by Islamic standards, but gave primacy to Isa (Jesus). The emir gave some land where Miller organized a settlement for them. Unfortunately sleeping sickness caused many deaths, but those children who had come to Miller's school survived. The leader, Malam Audu, started a sugar crushing business and his son Dr Ishaya Audu became the first Nigerian vice-chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.<br>
<br>Miller's greatest achievement was the translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Hausa with the help of Hausa and other missionaries. It was completed in 1935. Though the Hausa readership was small, it increasingly influenced many groups where Hausa was becoming the lingua franca. In the mid-1920s younger missionaries were dissatisfied with the cramped quarters and constant friction with the authorities in Zaria. The mission was subsequently transferred to Wusasa, a site outside the city, where there was more space for a school and hospital. Miller himself moved to Kano in 1929 where he concentrated on completing his translation. He retired in 1935 to England, where he married, but could not settle down and in 1939, after the death of his wife, he returned to Nigeria, eventually settling near Jos.<br>
<br>As well as articles in periodicals, Miller wrote <span class="italic">Reflections of a Pioneer</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Yesterday and tomorrow in Northern Nigeria</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Have we Failed in Nigeria?</span> (1947), <span class="italic">Success in Nigeria</span> (1948), <span class="italic">For Africans Only</span> (1950), and <span class="italic">Walter Miller, 1872&#150;1952: an Autobiography</span> which he completed in 1949 but which was published posthumously. He criticized the conservatism of the local administration, many Northern Nigerian Muslim customs, and some missionary practices, calling in 1938 for a moratorium on missions long before this became fashionable. Upright, autocratic, and uncompromising in his standards of integrity, Miller had many friends, but was difficult to live with. As his contemporaries died or retired he became a solitary figure, but one respected and admired by his former students. He died on 17 August 1952 at Plateau Hospital, Jos, Nigeria, and was buried at St Piran's Church, Jos.<br>
