<span class="headword">Gunnell,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">actor and impresario</span>, began his career as an actor in Prince Henry's company, playing at the Fortune Theatre under the management of Edward Alleyn. He was one of the fourteen names in the company's patent when it became the Lord Palsgrave's Men, in 1613. His fellows included Sam Rowley, a celebrated clown, and John Shank, a famous jig-dancer. Evidently a good friend of Alleyn, whose diary names him and his family dining with the Alleyns on a number of occasions, Gunnell moved gradually from acting into management with the Palsgrave's. When in 1618 Alleyn set up a deal with his tenants the Palsgrave's company at the Fortune, Gunnell was one of the four to take a part share. The deal was designed to imitate the King's Men's part ownership of their theatres, by which the company's leading players, the theatre's tenants, took out shares in the ownership of the building. Gunnell took a full one-eighth share.<br>
<br>A Catholic, like his rival and model Christopher Beeston, Gunnell first appears in the London records on 27 March 1612, when he was accused by a haberdasher of a breach of the peace. He was bailed out by Thomas Downton and another fellow actor on an unusually high-priced bond. Actors commonly bought their fellows out of gaol, since their services were needed on stage every day. The conflict may have related to buying clothes for the company. He was married by this time, since two daughters were baptized in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate (in January 1614 and September 1615). His wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1641?), was later to have a legal struggle over his properties after he died intestate. Gunnell wrote verses for his &#145;verie good friend&#146; John Smith's <span class="italic">Description of New England</span> in 1616, and after a fire at the Fortune in 1621 he wrote at least two plays, <span class="italic">The Hungarian Lion</span> (1623) and <span class="italic">The Way to Content All Women, or, How a Man may Please his Wife</span> (1624). None of the plays that he and his fellows wrote for the company at this time got into print. Through this period&#151;certainly from 1618 when he bought his share in the Fortune&#151;he appears to have served as company manager. He appears as the Fortune's representative in the records of the master of the revels for the Palsgrave's and for payments for other performances (including a tightrope walker) at the Fortune.<br>
<br>The years from 1621 were hard for Gunnell and the company. Unlike the burning of the Globe, which happened in an afternoon during a performance, the Fortune's fire happened at midnight, and in the absence of people to help rescue the company's valuables, as they did at the Globe, all of its plays and costumes were lost. Gunnell and the other leading players also lost their investment in the playhouse, and had to help pay for its reconstruction. The company in fact never recovered. On 30 April 1624 Gunnell had to take out a bond with six of the actors, including the clown Andrew Cane and William Cartwright, to hold them in the Palsgrave's. The company dissolved during the long closure of the playhouses through the dreadful plague epidemic that erupted shortly after James died in 1625. Gunnell then created a new company, merging elements from two former groups of James's time, his own Palsgrave's (now the King of Bohemia), with the Lady Elizabeth's (now the Queen of Bohemia).<br>
<br>From 1626, when playing re-started, for the next three years the King and Queen of Bohemia's Men continued to use the Fortune, with Gunnell as their landlord, as their London base. But a new pattern was emerging in London playgoing, and soon Gunnell launched a copy of it by building a small indoor playhouse, the Salisbury Court, in association with William Blagrave of the revels office. Since 1609 the King's Men had used an amphitheatre for summer playing and a roofed hall for the winter. In 1616 Christopher Beeston built a second hall theatre, the Cockpit, and ran it along with the Red Bull amphitheatre, one company in each, to his considerable profit. In 1629 Gunnell followed suit, adding the smallest of London's three hall playhouses to his open-air Fortune. The Salisbury Court Theatre was built in Whitefriars, a London suburb south of Fleet Street, near the river and his customers from the inns of court.<br>
<br>The hall playhouses catered to the gentry, especially to students and lawyers, rather than to the London citizenry, and charged higher prices accordingly. Gunnell set up a new company for it, chiefly of &#145;youths&#146;&#151;boy players whose playing carried a better social cachet than the companies of adult players. Among the plays he commissioned and staged at the new playhouse were George Chapman's <span class="italic">Sir Giles Goosecap</span>, Henry Glapthorne's <span class="italic">The Lady Mother</span>, Nathanael Richards's <span class="italic">Messallina</span>, Thomas Rawlins's <span class="italic">The Rebellion</span>, a play which had an almost unprecedented initial nine-day run, and equally notably <span class="italic">The Muses' Looking Glass</span>, the promising Thomas Randolph's earliest attempt at theatre writing. His <span class="italic">Amyntas</span> soon followed. With the young William Heminges's first play, in March 1633, <span class="italic">The Madcap, or, The Coursing of the Hare</span> (now lost), these plays show how ready Gunnell was to try his hand and his new company's with young writers. Shakerley Marmion wrote two plays for Gunnell there. It was a smaller theatre than the other two halls, and King Charles intervened at one point to ban gallants from using stools to sit on its stage, as they usually did at the other two, the Blackfriars and the Cockpit. However, partly because of its smaller capacity, it never quite secured the status of the other two halls that dominated playwriting in the 1630s. One of Marmion's plays, his <span class="italic">Holland's Leaguer</span>, has a prologue where he claimed to be almost but not quite overawed by the &#145;two great Lawrels&#146; that &#145;over-top us&#146;.<br>
<br>In July 1634, during another plague epidemic, an Oxford man, Samuel Crosfield, wrote a diary listing the playing companies then in the university town. His account names:<blockquote>The Company of Salisbury Court at the further end of fleet street against the Conduit: The cheife whereof are 1. Mr. Gunnell a Papist. 2. Mr. John Yongue. 3. Edward Gibbs a fencer. 4. Timothy Reed. 5. Christofer Goad. 6. Sam. Thompson. 7. Mr. Staffeild. 8. John Robinson. 9. Courteous Grevill. these are the cheife whereof 7 are called sharers i.e. such as pay wages to the servants &amp; equally share in the overplus. (Crosfield, 72)</blockquote>Reed was the Salisbury Court's star, a famous clown, Robinson was a promising young actor who later married Gunnell's widow, Elizabeth. Gunnell never became exclusively an impresario.<br>
<br>Gunnell died early in October 1634, and was buried at St Bride's in Fleet Street on the 7th. The register described him as of Salisbury Court, where he had a dwelling house. He had been back there from July, when the King's Revels returned to perform at the hall playhouse. Some time before his death he appears to have passed on the management of the newer of his two playhouses, and its company, to a new man. The ambitions of the man who took over his role as impresario at Salisbury Court, Richard Heton, may have been a factor behind that. Heton, who was never an actor, proved less congenial as a theatre manager than Gunnell, both for the companies he managed and for the playwrights from whom he commissioned plays.<br>
<br>In 1637 Thomas Jordan published an elegy written for &#145;<i>his Inestimable friend, Mr.</i> Richard Gunnell, <i>Gent.</i>&#146;, in which he writes of &#145;his neglected ashes&#146;  (Bentley, 2.457).<br>
