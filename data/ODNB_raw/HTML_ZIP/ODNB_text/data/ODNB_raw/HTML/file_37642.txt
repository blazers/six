<span class="headword">Knyvet, Sir  Henry</span>  (1537?&#150;1598), <span class="occ">soldier and member of parliament</span>, was the first son of Sir Henry Knyvet (<i>d</i>. 1546?) and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Christopher Pickering. In 1563 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Stumpe of Charlton, near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. She died in 1585, and he subsequently (by 1595) married Mary, daughter of Sir John Sydenham. Knyvet's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15799/', "Sir Thomas Knyvet")</script> was master of the horse to Henry VIII, and his father a gentleman of the privy chamber and soldier.<br>
<br>In 1560 Knyvet became a gentleman pensioner to Queen Elizabeth I. This connection, and the links he sustained with prominent men in Wiltshire, helped to ensure his position among the office-holding gentry, despite enmities fostered by land disputes persisting throughout the 1560s and 1570s. He was a justice of the peace, served as sheriff of the county, and became a deputy lieutenant in 1585. He was knighted in 1574. In 1587 either Knyvet or a member of his family served in the Netherlands, suggesting protestant sympathies. Knyvet was instructed to raise 2000 Wiltshire men towards the national defences when the Armada threatened in 1588, and his contribution to county military affairs was much valued.<br>
<br>In parliament Knyvet represented either Wootton Bassett or Malmesbury from 1571 to 1597, but he never became knight of the shire. Though considered by one observer to have been a bore, he seems to have done valuable service on a number of committees, many of them dealing with bills concerning arms and defences. In later years relations with court and council were more strained. By January 1593 an incident involving a royal servant coming to serve process on a member of his household had resulted in two spells in prison. In March he probably did his credit no good in the House of Commons when he appears to have argued that proceedings in the subsidy bill should be kept secret, even from the queen herself.<br>
<br>The army was a major part of Knyvet's life. He was wounded at the siege of Leith in 1560 and nine years later he stood against the northern rising, subsequently advising on the defence of the northern border. His <span class="italic">Defence of the Realm</span>, written in 1596, was prompted by the fall of Calais to the Spanish. Like many before and since he was concerned about the ability of England to resist an invader, should the navy fail as first line of defence. His concern about the organization of the militia was timely, but his intended reliance on the longbow was hardly forward-looking.<br>
<br>Knyvet provides an interesting illustration of the problems faced by the crown in raising revenue. At his death he owed the queen &pound;4000 from rents on forest land in his care as sub-warden, but there was a suggestion that he settled lands on his daughters so as to deprive the queen of her due. Yet in parliament in 1593 he had apparently spoken of the need to maximize yields from royal assets in order to finance the strong army which he thought so important. Knyvet died at Charlton, Wiltshire on 14 June 1598. There is a fine monumental effigy of him with Elizabeth, his first wife, in the church at Charlton, where he was buried on 25 July 1598. He had two sons and four daughters; three of his daughters with Elizabeth, including the eldest, Katherine [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70618/', "Howard, Katherine")</script>], married into families holding the earldoms of Suffolk, Lincoln, and Rutland.<br>
