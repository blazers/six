<span class="headword">Pelagius</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>390&#150;418), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, is said by his contemporaries of the years about 400, such as Augustine of Hippo, Prosper of Aquitaine, Marius Mercator, and Paul Orosius, to have been of British origin. Beyond that there is no information, and attempts to interpret his name as a Hellenization of the Welsh &#145;Morgan&#146; or the Irish &#145;Muirchu&#146; represent philological wishful thinking. The dates of his birth and death are unknown. According to Augustine, Pelagius had long resided at Rome, before he emerged into disastrous prominence. He was a layman, and although sometimes called a monk is not known to have had any connection with a religious community. His concerns were theological, together with the spiritual direction of his patrons among the Christian Roman aristocracy. His interests included biblical commentary and theological doctrine as well as moral and ascetic theology. He was particularly concerned to vindicate Christian asceticism against any imputation of Manichaeism and to prove that a sinless life is possible for a practising Christian. Accordingly, he laid stress upon the freedom of will enjoyed by the baptized believer once the guilt of sin has been remitted in baptism. It was in this context that the denial of any transmission of original sin, a doctrine apparently learned from Rufinus the Syrian (not to be confused with Rufinus of Aquileia, the translator of Origen and Eusebius of Caesarea), who resided at Rome in the reign of Pope Anastasius (399&#150;401), constituted an essential element in Pelagius's doctrine. With this view&#151;a foundation article of belief for any Pelagian&#151;went an understanding of grace (<i>gratia</i>) as being essentially a divine illumination which, following the remission of sins in baptism, enables the Christian to see what is right and then to do it by the power of his divinely created nature. Such a conception is utterly different from that of Pelagius's principal adversary, Augustine of Hippo, for whom grace was the divine aid necessary to perform every righteous action&#151;a belief which seemed to Pelagius to remove any element of human initiative in good works. Hence his furious outburst at Rome about 405 when he heard Augustine's famous prayer from the <span class="italic">Confessions</span> quoted: &#145;Give what You command and command what You will&#146; and declared that he could not endure such sentiments  (Augustine, &#145;De dono perseverantiae&#146;, 20, 53).<br>
<br>Among Pelagius's Roman disciples was Caelestius, an aristocrat converted from a legal career to asceticism, a more forceful personality than Pelagius, and the real apostle of the so-called Pelagian movement. In 409, when Rome was menaced by Alaric the Goth, Pelagius and Caelestius abandoned the city and went to north Africa. Pelagius, having missed encountering Augustine, soon departed for Palestine, where many upper-class Romans had fled after the sack of Rome in 410. Caelestius remained behind, to proclaim Rufinus the Syrian's denial of the doctrine of original sin, for which he was excommunicated by a Carthaginian council in 411. He left Africa and went to Antioch, where he was subsequently ordained to the priesthood. However, Caelestius's theology remained influential and Augustine began to write and preach against it, though he had, as yet, avoided any breach with Pelagius, even sending him, in 413, a friendly letter, which Pelagius subsequently employed as proof of his own orthodoxy.<br>
<br>In Palestine, Pelagius was amicably received by Bishop John of Jerusalem and bitterly opposed by St Jerome, the biblical scholar and translator, then living at Bethlehem. In 415 Jerome was visited by a Spanish priest, Paul Orosius, entrusted by the African bishops with the task of making common cause with Jerome against Pelagius, to whom they imputed the doctrines condemned in Caelestius. At a diocesan synod at Jerusalem in late July 415 Orosius, when asked about Pelagius, denounced him and, in effect, invited John and his colleagues to condemn Pelagius and Caelestius because their doctrine differed from that of Augustine and Jerome. Pelagius was then invited to attend the synod and speak in his own defence. Orosius's domineering manner effectively turned the feelings of the synod against himself, so that he was able to avoid a condemnation of his own position only by successfully proposing that the whole matter should be referred to Pope Innocent I. However, on 12 September Orosius was publicly accused by Bishop John of holding that human beings are so corrupted by the fall that they cannot avoid sinning even with the help of God's grace. Orosius indignantly denied the charge, composed an apologia, and returned to Africa in January 416, there to report the failure of his mission.<br>
<br>Meanwhile two Gallic bishops, Heros and Lazarus, political exiles in Palestine, brought an accusation of heresy against Pelagius which was heard at a council at Diospolis (Lod) in December 415. When it opened, however, neither of the accusers was present, and Pelagius was able to defend himself without cross-examination. Some of the charges he refuted; others, ascribed to Caelestius, he said were no concern of his. It is possible that he was disingenuous in his pleading, but the council was persuaded, and he was declared to be in communion with the faith of the Catholic church.<br>
<br>When the news of Pelagius's acquittal reached Africa, supplemented by the report of Orosius, the Catholic bishops were much alarmed, since it seemed to them that African theology, in which the transmission of original sin was an article of faith, had been repudiated by two oriental synods. Augustine was particularly concerned, for he had read Pelagius's treatise <span class="italic">De natura</span> and been shocked by its teaching. Two African councils, held in the middle of 416, denounced Pelagius and Caelestius and Pope Innocent I was persuaded to add his condemnation, which he did on 27 January 417, before dying on 27 March. His successor, Zosimus, when approached by Caelestius, decided to reopen the case, being persuaded that justice had not been done to the accused. His attempt, however, foundered on the implacable opposition of the Africans and the decision of the emperor Honorius (then residing at Ravenna) who, in a decree of 30 April 418, condemned anyone who denied the fall and ordered that Pelagius and Caelestius, both of whom he assumed to be at Rome, should be banished from Italy. Next day, 1 May, an African general council, held at Carthage, enacted a series of nine canons expressing the African doctrine of original sin in the most uncompromising terms. Under this pressure Zosimus then issued a decree, now lost, called the <span class="italic">Epistola tractoria</span>, which condemned and excommunicated both Pelagius and Caelestius.<br>
<br>For Pelagius, Zosimus's condemnation meant ruin. He endeavoured to effect a reconciliation with Augustine, whom he recognized as his principal opponent, but Augustine declined to accept his declaration of faith. He was subsequently expelled from Jerusalem and found refuge in Egypt, where St Cyril of Alexandria allowed him to settle. Thereafter he vanishes from history.<br>
<br>As a result of his condemnation Pelagius was, for centuries, regarded as a heresiarch of the deepest dye. Twentieth-century studies, initiated by Georges de Plinval's biography of 1943, see him rather as a would-be orthodox Christian thinker, whose system proved inadequate to meet the denunciation of Augustine and the African episcopate. Judgement is not made easier by the difficulty of identifying his authentic writings from the mass of literature emanating from Pelagian circles. One thing however is clear: there was little capacity for leadership in Pelagius's character, such as appears in Caelestius, or any great controversial ability, such as that later revealed by the Pelagian apologist, Julian of Eclanum. The Pelagians were sometimes styled &#145;Caelestians&#146;, and this name seems more appropriate.<br>
<br>Despite his heretical reputation, Pelagius's Pauline commentaries remained popular in the middle ages, sometimes circulating under the name of his bitter enemy, St Jerome, as did his hortatory letter to the aristocratic virgin Demetrias, when she took the veil in 413.<br>
<br>Pelagianism is reported to have found considerable support in Britain, requiring visits by St Germanus of Auxerre in 429 and, less certainly, between about 436 and 444 to denounce it. It has been suggested by J. N. L. Myres, John Morris, and others that the alleged Pelagian denial of grace represented, in fifth-century Britain, an attack on political <i>gratia</i> (corrupt patronage and favour), thus understanding Pelagianism as a reforming movement in a society seeking to shake off Roman imperial decadence and to revive the traditional Roman virtues. The topic is too large to be fully discussed here. It may, however, be said that it has been powerfully criticized by J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz  (1963; 1967) and has failed to convince scholars who have studied Pelagianism as a theological system. As B. R. Rees has pointed out  (<span class="italic">Pelagius: a Reluctant Heretic</span>, 1988, 112), far from being, as his opponents alleged, an <i>inimicus gratiae</i> (an enemy of <i>gratia</i>), Pelagius's principal defence of his orthodoxy was to claim that he accepted grace in the Augustinian sense, &#145;not for every hour or every moment, but for each individual action of our lives&#146;  (Augustine, <span class="italic">De gratia Christi</span>, 1,2,2). He deserved better than to be condemned as a heretic as a result of prejudice and a succession of unfortunate accidents which, with better luck, he might have escaped.<br>
