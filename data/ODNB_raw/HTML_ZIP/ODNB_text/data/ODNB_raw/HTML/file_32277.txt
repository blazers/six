<span class="headword">Cannan,  Charles</span>  (1858&#150;1919), <span class="occ">Aristotelian scholar and publisher</span>, was born at Richmond, Surrey, on 2 August 1858, son of David Alexander Cannan (1820&#150;1877), a building contractor of Kirkcudbrightshire, and his wife, Jane Dorothea Claude (1822&#150;1861), a Sunday school teacher of Huguenot descent. His brother was the economist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32278/', "Edwin Cannan (1861&#150;1935)")</script>. He was educated at Clifton College and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Cannan was elected fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1884. He became classical tutor and dean in 1884, and junior bursar in 1887.<br>
<br>After an accomplished period as an unorthodox tutor and lecturer Cannan was elected a delegate of Oxford University Press in 1895, and the direction of his career was determined when in 1898 the delegates appointed him their secretary in succession to Philip Lyttelton Gell. He remained in the post until his death, and made Oxford what he deemed &#145;it ought to be: the first Press in the world&#146;  (Sutcliffe, 107). On 18 December 1891 he married Mary Wedderburn (1857&#150;1943), daughter of Andrew Wedderburn-Maxwell of Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, and Glenlair, Kirkcudbrightshire. They had three daughters: Dorothea, who married the printer and assistant secretary to the delegates John Johnson; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56904/', "Joanna Maxwell Cannan (1896&#150;1961)")</script>, children's writer; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98106/', "May Wedderburn Cannan")</script>. Cannan died at his home, Magdalen Gate House, Oxford, on 15 December 1919, his wife surviving him; he was buried three days later in Holywell cemetery.<br>
<br>During his secretaryship Cannan promoted great expansion in the press's business and in the number of its branches overseas. By nature conservative and cautious, he seldom seemed to initiate far-reaching changes of policy. He conceived of the press as an institution possessing inherited characters and a natural growth. He saw himself as fostering its growth rather than as giving it new directions.<br>
<br>Cannan's greatest reform concerned the press's London office. From here, Henry Frowde had distributed titles and managed the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayer book business. Cannan saw that the time had come for Oxford men to direct the office. The changes which he made, especially Humphrey Milford's appointment as publisher in 1913, turned the London office into a real university department. Cannan also encouraged fresh projects, including <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of English Verse</span>, the <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span>, and the revival of the seventeenth-century Fell types, notably in Robert Bridges' <span class="italic">The Yattendon Hymnal</span> (1899). He was secretary when in 1917 the descendants of George Smith offered the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> to the press. Cannan was already in dispute with Sidney Lee, hitherto the editor, about a contract and the acceptance of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> was problematic. John Johnson, the assistant secretary, recalled in a letter: &#145;Cannan hated Sidney Lee, had quarrelled with Sir Charles Firth &hellip; disliked A. F. Pollard and altogether regarded the <span class="roman">D.N.B.</span> as a white elephant. They were the most melancholy Delegates meetings I ever remember before the gift was finally accepted&#146;  (Matthew, 7).<br>
<br>Cannan was a conservative and an imperialist, but not a party man. Local affairs interested him, and he sat on Oxford city council. He was an influential presence on Oxford's committee of appointments, but made few public appearances. He rarely left Oxford except on mountaineering holidays. Rugby football, proofs of <span class="italic">The Oxford English Dictionary</span>, the daily newspaper, and Aristotle were his other pastimes. His single, anonymous book was the <span class="italic">Selecta ex organo Aristotelio capitula</span> (1897).<br>
<br>Cannan's manner was formidable. His enthusiasms were unspoken. His tone was dry, even cynical. He had a mean opinion of human intelligence in general, and not a very high one of human probity. His last weapon, which he used ruthlessly, was silence. This is, perhaps, not the description of a great man, or even a lovable one. Yet Cannan was both. Those who knew him saw a man of great intellectual power and subtlety; of rare determination; and of unselfish devotion to the things he loved.<br>
