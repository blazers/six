<span class="headword">Collet,  Clara Elizabeth</span>  (1860&#150;1948), <span class="occ">civil servant and promoter of women's education and employment</span>, was born at Sunny Bank, Hornsey Lane, Islington, London, on 10 September 1860, the second daughter and fourth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42336/', "Collet Dobson Collet (1812&#150;1898)")</script>, a prominent champion of press freedom and editor of <span class="italic">The Free Press</span> (later the <span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span>), and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sloan, who ran a laundry in north London. The surname Collet was one which Clara's father and her aunt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41272/', "Sophia Dobson Collet")</script>, an authority on Brahmo Samaj, had added to their given surname Dobson, as an inheritance from their grandmothers. The family tradition was unitarian and radical, and Clara's father was closely associated with Karl Marx; in childhood Clara was very friendly with the Marx family (especially Eleanor Marx), though in adult life she was unimpressed by Marx's philosophy.<br>
<br>Clara Collet was educated at the North London Collegiate School for Girls from 1873 to 1878, when she was persuaded by the headmistress, Frances Buss, to take up a teaching post at Wyggeston Girls' School, Leicester, where she worked from 1878 to 1885. While there she read for her first degree, and followed this by enrolling at University College, London, where she took an MA in mental and moral science (possibly the first woman to do so); she won the Joseph Hume scholarship in political economy in 1886, and completed her course in 1888. Her tutor was the economist H. S. Foxwell, whose friend and partisan she quickly became. She also acquired a deserved reputation as a statistician and an economist.<br>
<br>In 1891 Collet began a long and distinguished career in government service, with her appointment as assistant commissioner to the royal commission on labour. From 1888 to 1892 she also collaborated with Charles Booth on his classic sociological study, <span class="italic">The Life and Labour of the People of London</span>. This fitted in well with her statistical and sociological background and inclinations. Her published contributions to the text were her essays on women's work in the East End of London, and on secondary education for girls, reflecting her lifelong concerns with women's education and employment. In 1893 she was appointed labour correspondent to the Board of Trade. She made reports to the royal commission on secondary education in 1894, and to parliament on the wages of domestic servants in 1899. In 1903 she became senior investigator (for women's industries) at the Board of Trade, and from 1909 she attended meetings chaired by the president of the Board of Trade (then Winston Churchill). Her initial enthusiasm for working in close contact with leading politicians rapidly led to frustration, to the extent that she threatened resignation in 1910 over the treatment of women in labour exchanges. Despite this she remained at the Board of Trade and in 1920 was appointed a member of the trade boards, a position which she held until 1932.<br>
<br>In addition to her government employments, Collet held various posts concerned with women's education, most notably as president of the Association of Assistant Mistresses in Secondary Schools, in 1891, and as a governor of Bedford College, London, from 1902 until her death in 1948. She was also a member of the council of the Royal Statistical Society from 1919 to 1935, and a member of the council of the Royal Economic Society from 1920 to 1941, as well as being an active member of the Fabian Society, and of the Charity Organization Society.<br>
<br>Collet published a number of articles on the situation of working women, some of which she collected and published together in three highly influential books: <span class="italic">The Economic Position of Educated Working Women</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Educated Working Women</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">Women in Industry</span> (1911). In addition she provided statistics for the inquiries of the British Association for the Advancement of Science into women's employment in 1900. She was probably the first British promoter of women's employment to base her arguments on a foundation of statistical evidence and systematic interviewing. In this she found herself able to challenge the pronouncements of such established economists as Alfred Marshall, and, ironically, she appears to have influenced his wife, the equally eminent economist Mary Paley Marshall.<br>
<br>In 1893 Collet became a friend of the novelist George Gissing, on whose works she had already lectured publicly. A long and vigorous correspondence with him rapidly developed into a close friendship, in which she acted as his confidante as well as helping him financially when she was able. After his death in 1903, as a trustee of his estate she continued to take an active interest in his sons and remained a friend of Gabrielle Fleury, his common-law wife at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Collet had a considerable interest in her family history, and in her later years she devoted considerable time to this, lecturing in India on Joseph Collet, a former governor of the Madras presidency, whose notebooks she finally prevailed upon Longmans to publish (with her annotations), in 1933.<br>
<br>Collet was short and dark-haired. Although not from a poor background, she had to work to support herself, and her earnings and consequent savings were her only guarantee of financial security and independence. Her manner appears to have been decisive and authoritative; and her nephew Robert Collet recalled that she always had to be right about everything, and she usually was  (Tindall, 171). She appears to have dominated her family in her latter years, and after a mastectomy in 1936 she moved them all from Hampstead in London to Sidmouth, Devon. Clara Collet died at her home, Clifton, Cliff Road, Salcombe Regis, Sidmouth, Devon, on 3 August 1948.<br>
