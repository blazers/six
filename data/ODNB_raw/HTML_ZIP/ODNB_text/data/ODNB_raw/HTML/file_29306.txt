<span class="headword">Whitford,  David</span>  (1626&#150;1674), <span class="occ">army officer and scholar</span>, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29309/', "Walter Whitford (d. 1647)")</script>, bishop of Brechin, and Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1660), daughter of Sir John Carmichael and great niece of the regent, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29307/', "John Whitford")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29305/', "Adam Whitford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29309/', "Whitford, Walter (d. 1647)")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29310/', "Walter Whitford (b. c.1617, d. in or after 1691)")</script> were his elder brothers. He was educated at Westminster School, where he was elected a queen's scholar on a royal warrant dated 21 March 1640. Two years later, aged sixteen, he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford; he graduated BA on 30 March 1647. On the outbreak of the civil wars he espoused the king's cause and took up arms as a member of the garrison at Oxford. It is said that in consequence he was deprived of his studentship by the parliamentary visitors in 1648, and returned to his native land, although his name does not appear in the published edition of the visitors' register. He became an officer in Charles II's army which invaded England in 1651, and fought at the battle of Worcester. He was wounded, taken prisoner, carried to Oxford, and then conveyed to London, where his friends' importunity obtained his release.<br>
<br>Edward Bysshe, abstentionist MP for Bletchingley in Surrey and intruded garter and clarenceux king of arms, relieved Whitford from straitened circumstances following his imprisonment. The Scot was found employment as an usher teaching Greek at the school in Whitefriars, near Fleet Street, run by the Catholic poet James Shirley. Some complimentary verses penned by Whitford prefaced Francis Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Hugo Grotius his Sophompaneas</span> in 1652. In 1654 he published Latin translations of three works by Bysshe on the work of various armorial scholars. In 1655 he published <span class="italic">Musaei, Moschi et Bionis</span>, selections from Theocritus's <span class="italic">Eidyllia</span> in Latin and Greek dedicated to Bysshe, and republished in 1659. In November 1658 a David Whitford of Ashton, Northamptonshire, gentleman, was entered as a student of the Inner Temple, and although it seems unlikely to have been the Scot, there is no way of knowing for sure. Whitford wrote, possibly as early as 1652, an appendix, entitled <span class="italic">Montrose Redivivus</span>, which appeared in George Wishart's <span class="italic">Compleat History of the Wars in Scotland</span>, published in 1660.<br>
<br>On the restoration of Charles II Whitford was reinstated to his Oxford studentship by the visitors, but, finding himself disabled from holding it by the college statutes, he petitioned the king in December 1660 to grant him a dispensation. He was created MA on 14 January 1661. In 1666 he was commissioned chaplain in the regiment of foot under the command of Lord George Douglas. Afterwards he was chaplain to John Maitland, duke of Lauderdale, and in 1672 he officiated as minister to the Scottish regiment in France. In 1673 he was appointed rector of Middleton Tyas in Yorkshire. He died suddenly in his chambers at Christ Church on 26 October 1674, and was buried on the following day in the south transept of the cathedral, near his brother Adam.<br>
