<span class="headword">Brailes,  William  de</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1230&#150;1260), <span class="occ">manuscript artist</span>, whose signature, W. de Brail', appears in two illustrated manuscripts of the mid-thirteenth century, is almost certainly identifiable as the William de Brailes named in five Oxford property deeds of <i>c</i>.1230&#150;1260. Although the documents do not specify William's trade, one deed names him as witness along with three illuminators, three bookbinders, and a parchment maker. He lived in Catte Street, approximately on the present site of All Souls College chapel, within the area around St Mary's Church where the Oxford book trade was concentrated. Differences of style within the manuscripts containing the signature show that he worked with several other artists. Art historians have concluded that William de Brailes was the head of a workshop of manuscript artists based at his tenement in Catte Street.<br>
<br>Brailes's name implies that he came originally from Upper or Lower Brailes (Warwickshire), near Shipston-on-Stour. His signature in the manuscripts accompanies a depiction of a tonsured figure who does not wear the habit of any religious order. William was probably a clerk in minor orders. One of the Oxford documents mentions that he had a wife, Celena.<br>
<br>Brailes and his assistants decorated about a dozen surviving manuscripts. These include several <span class="roman">Bibles</span>; a psalter; sets of illustrated leaves which probably originally belonged to two psalters; and the earliest surviving fully illustrated English book of hours. The decoration of this group of manuscripts comprises full-page pictures, mostly of <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scenes; historiated and ornamental initials; and colourful line-fillers which occasionally include representations of animals, birds, and fish. Characteristic of the workshop are long ornamental extensions to the initials. The extensions occupy the borders and frame the accompanying text. The figure style of the workshop is vigorous if somewhat coarse. Colours are subdued, with dark and light blue, brown, and pink predominating.<br>
<br>Brailes also decorated one page of a psalter possibly made in London, and may therefore have spent part of his career away from Oxford. Paintings of four apostles and an angel on the vault of the chapter house of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, are in his style. These may show that he occasionally worked as a wall painter, or at least supplied designs for wall paintings.<br>
<br>William de Brailes and his workshop exemplify a significant development in later medieval book production. In the thirteenth century the decoration of manuscripts was passing out of the hands of the religious houses to artists who were grouped together within the towns and who worked for patrons both lay and ecclesiastical. The William de Brailes workshop in Oxford is the first workshop to which a name and a definite location can be assigned and whose products can be identified.<br>
