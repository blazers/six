<span class="headword">Mattuck,  Israel Isidor</span>  (1883&#150;1954), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born on 28 December 1883 in Shirvint, Lithuania, the third child of the seven children of Benjamin and Bessie (their original surname is unknown), who took the name Mattuck on arrival in the USA, <i>c</i>.1890. Israel Mattuck was enrolled at the Classical High School in Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1901 gained entry to Harvard University, where he specialized in Semitics. His teachers included C. H. Toy, the eminent biblical scholar, and George Foot Moore, the outstanding authority on rabbinic Judaism. In his leaving testimonial of 1905 Toy described Mattuck as &#145;an exceptionally promising man, both in scholarship and character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liberal Jewish Monthly</span>, June 1954). Moore was equally impressed.<br>
<br>From an early age Mattuck had studied the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> with his father. His interpretation and practice of Judaism would diverge radically from that of his traditional background, not least when he enrolled at the Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, the foremost seminary for the training of Reform rabbis. Part of his studentship was spent in leading a congregation in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he met his wife-to-be, Edna Minna Mayer (1888&#150;1957). They married on 3 November 1910, had their first child, Robert, in 1911, and subsequently also had two daughters, Dorothy and Naomi. Theirs was a happy and compatible marriage.<br>
<br>After ordination in 1910 Mattuck became rabbi of a fledgeling congregation in Far Rockaway, New York. He was to stay only a few months. By 1911 the Jewish Religious Union, established in London in 1902, had grown to the stage where it required a rabbi to expound its distinctive message. The movement acquired a building in Hill Street, near Regent's Park, and founded the Liberal Jewish Synagogue (LJS). Mattuck accepted the invitation to become its first minister. His inaugural sermon on 20 January 1912 was entitled &#145;The aim of Liberal Judaism&#146;. Those who heard it, and those who heard him from the pulpit during the subsequent four decades, recall an exceptionally powerful, compelling preacher. Small of stature, slim, ascetic-looking, decisive in his judgments, thoroughly grounded in Jewish sources and well read in general culture, his eloquence laced with humour, Mattuck had the rare gift of being able to communicate with all manner of people at the appropriate level, from children to university dons. Under his leadership, the LJS developed rapidly. He was fortunate in having gifted co-workers in Claude Montefiore, a distinguished scholar, and the Hon. Lily Montagu, daughter of Edwin Montagu, the first Lord Swaythling (the triumvirate was called &#145;the three Ms&#146;); but it was the force of Mattuck's personality, the sway of his preaching, and the quality of his religious instruction that turned curious newcomers into ardent disciples.<br>
<br>The congregation outgrew its Hill Street premises. Mattuck, although personally diffident about fund-raising, spearheaded the building appeal which resulted in the imposing sanctuary behind stone pillars that stands opposite the Grace gate of Lord's cricket ground. His consecration sermon of 13 September 1925 contained a summation of his own credo: &#145;In the simple, the almost austere beauty of this synagogue, I feel a token of our faith. It has for us the beauty of simplicity, and it is austere in the demands it makes&#146;  (Mattuck MSS, London). Implementation of those demands elevated Mattuck to a leading role among clergy of whatever denomination in the UK. He was controversially sympathetic to the workers' cause during the general strike of 1926, in 1927 co-founded with W. R. Matthews, dean of St Paul's, the (London) Society of Jews and Christians, the first inter-faith group in the country, and for several years conducted Sunday morning services in addition to the regular sabbath ones, which many non-Jews would attend in order to hear his views on topical issues. He considered it his task to spread Liberal Judaism beyond the LJS. Conferences were organized in London and the provinces. These provoked lively reactions from Orthodox Jewish opponents, but usually his eloquence, personal charm, and formidable Jewish knowledge carried the day and led to the establishment of several new Liberal congregations.<br>
<br>Mattuck wrote numerous pamphlets, monographs, and essays, and broadcast regularly. Substantial and lasting works of his include <span class="italic">What are the Jews?</span> (1937), a religious interpretation of Jewish history and mission, <span class="italic">The Essentials of Liberal Judaism</span> (1947), a concise summation of its principles and beliefs, and the three volumes of the <span class="italic">Liberal Jewish Prayer Book</span> (1926; rev. edn, 1937), radical compilations that combined a drastically pruned traditional liturgy with material from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, later Jewish literature, English poetry, and many of Mattuck's own compositions. On 1 November 1940 an enemy bomb partially destroyed the synagogue, but services continued throughout the war, at Lord's, then in a neighbouring church hall, and finally in the homes of local congregants. Those years took a heavy toll on his health. In 1948 he retired as senior minister of the LJS, and became minister emeritus. Three years later he was taken critically ill with coronary thrombosis, but he recovered sufficiently to give a stirring address at the reconsecration service of the rebuilt synagogue in September 1951.<br>
<br>The respite was brief. Although he managed to write two books, <span class="italic">The Thought of the Prophets</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">Jewish Ethics</span> (1953), and was planning another, Mattuck's health was deteriorating. He was too ill to celebrate publicly his seventieth birthday in December 1953, and died four months later, on 3 April 1954 at home at Wildwood, North End, London. He was buried three days later in the Liberal Jewish cemetery at Willesden. His death was reported on the BBC national news, received obituary notices in the major newspapers, and occasioned widespread tributes in Anglo-Jewry and beyond.<br>
