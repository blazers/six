<span class="headword">Cannan,  Edwin</span>  (1861&#150;1935), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 3 February 1861 at Funchal, Madeira, son of David Alexander Cannan (1820&#150;1877) of Kirkcudbrightshire, formerly a manufacturer's agent, and his wife, Jane Dorothea (1822&#150;1861), formerly Claude. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32277/', "Charles Cannan")</script> was his elder brother; an elder sister was born in the mid-1850s while David and Jane were in Australia, but she died in infancy. A substantial legacy was left to Jane in 1854; it was her poor health during the later 1850s that precipitated first a move from Richmond, Surrey, to Bournemouth, and subsequently to Madeira. She died there thirteen days after giving birth to Edwin, who was named after his godfather, Edwin Chadwick, a close friend of David Cannan  (Kadish, <span class="italic">Oxford Economists</span>, 6&#150;7). David Cannan and his two sons soon returned to Bournemouth to live with his older sister, Agnes, and then, following her death in 1864, with another sister, Margaret. In 1868 David married Eliza Weekes and the family moved to her school, Aschan House; Eliza, however, died in the following year.<br>
<br>Edwin Cannan, who was colour-blind, tone-deaf, and of a delicate constitution, attended Aschan House School, and then in 1876 followed his brother, Charles, to Clifton College, the family having moved to Bristol so that Edwin might attend as a day boy. The following year David Cannan died while touring Ireland, bequeathing to each of his sons, neither yet twenty, a comfortable private income. Edwin entered Balliol College, Oxford, in January 1881 as a commoner, and moved with his aunt Margaret into rooms at 24 St Giles', where they were to share a simple daily routine for many years. Poor health during the spring of 1882 prompted Edwin to abandon his plans to sit for an honours degree; instead in 1884 he took a pass degree, and then embarked on a trip around the world with his aunt  (Kadish, <span class="italic">Oxford Economists</span>, 10). Having returned to Oxford, Edwin began to work up an essay on Saint-Simon (1675&#150;1755) for the Lothian prize, which he was awarded in 1885.<br>
<br>Cannan's fragile health ruled out the peripatetic rigours of lecturing for the Oxford extension, and in any event his private income meant that he was not, like many of his contemporaries, impelled into teaching political economy to earn a living. Another essay was entered, unsuccessfully, for the Cobden prize in 1886; a revised section was published as <span class="italic">Elementary Political Economy</span> (1888), and his 1889 paper to the Fabian Society  (E. Cannan, &#145;Economics and socialism&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Economic Outlook</span>, 1912, 53&#150;86) also built on the Cobden essay. Through this latter paper he came to know Sidney Webb, who later persuaded Cannan to join the part-time staff of the London School of Economics (LSE) when it opened in 1895. This proved to be a turning point in Cannan's life, for the vigour that he brought to the school belied the fragile health of his youth. He was appointed professor of political economy in 1907, the year of his marriage, on 12 June, at Cheltenham, in a Presbyterian ceremony, to his second cousin, Margaret Mary (Rita) Cullen (<i>b</i>. 1870/71), daughter of David Cullen (deceased), who had been deputy surgeon-general; they had one son, David Ricardo, who died in 1918. Cannan retired from his LSE chair in 1926 after joining with Graham Wallas and A. L. Bowley as a founder editor of the school's journal <span class="italic">Economica</span>.<br>
<br>Oxford was at the centre of academic economics in Britain during the 1880s. Interest in political economy was linked to a wider concern for social reform and Irish home rule, both of which found expression in a number of university and college societies in which Cannan actively participated. Among his student contemporaries were W. J. Ashley, E. C. K. Gonner, Langford Price, and H. L. Smith, while Alfred Marshall succeeded Arnold Toynbee for a brief spell as tutor at Balliol in 1883 before leaving at the end of 1884 for Cambridge. At this time in Oxford political economy was taught in the context of modern history, and a broadly historical approach marked Oxford economics well into the twentieth century. Early influenced by the historian A. L. Smith, Cannan's Lothian essay is an unremarkable historical biography of the life and times not of the social thinker Saint-Simon, but of an aristocratic predecessor. <span class="italic">Elementary Political Economy</span> is, however, a broadly unhistorical text, expounding classical principles with aggressive common sense, notable mainly for a wilful avoidance of the term &#145;capital&#146; and a consequent resort to obscure circumlocution. As his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist later observed, &#145;In controversy he may not always have hit the right nail, but he hit it on the head, and hit it very hard&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 April 1935).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The History of the Theories of Production and Distribution</span> (1893) is by contrast a work of some scholarship, but even a cursory glance reveals that Cannan's approach was at once more analytical and critical than historical. He eschewed formal and mathematical reasoning, judging his subject matter in terms of current &#145;good sense&#146;, a quality he rarely encountered in his reading of the classical economists. Alfred Marshall, he thought, was too soft on these writers; W. S. Jevons provided the underlying theoretical principles by which all economics, past and present, should be measured. By this standard the classical economists were woefully inadequate, argued Cannan  (Maloney, 70), but as practical responses to contemporary problems their abstractions made more sense. Cannan criticized past economic theory from the standpoint of modern economics, and then used history to account for its shortcomings&#151;the reverse of what one might have expected of a historically inclined economist. This was because he saw himself primarily as an economic theorist building upon, and renovating where necessary, the established body of classical doctrine&#151;for he remained until his death a classical rather than a neo-classical theorist, despite his admiration for the work of Jevons.<br>
<br>Cannan's most lasting contribution was as an editor of Adam Smith, where his acuity and scholarship are displayed at their best. In 1895 a chance encounter with an Edinburgh lawyer brought into his hands a set of student notes from Smith's Glasgow lectures of 1763. Since Smith's executors had (on Smith's instructions) destroyed most of his papers when he died, the discovery of this notebook contributed significantly to understanding of the work. Cannan published the notes as <span class="italic">Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue and Arms</span> (1896), and this edition was not superseded until an augmented edition appeared in 1978. Similarly, in 1904 he published an edition of Smith's <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span> that remained the standard critical text until 1976.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s Cannan became a regular contributor on legislative and administrative matters to the new Oxford-based <span class="italic">Economic Review</span>, and developed an especial interest in the evolution of local government taxation. This formed the subject of his first course of lectures at the LSE in 1895, published the following year (1896) as an account of the early modern statutory foundation of local systems of taxation. His teaching for the school developed rapidly, combining in his core lectures the history of economics with an appraisal of recent economic theory based upon a critical evaluation of Marshallian economics. The first-year lectures on economic principles that he gave were written up as the introductory textbook <span class="italic">Wealth</span> (1914), a copy of which was placed in a time capsule under a foundation-stone for an extension laid at the school by the king in May 1920  (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 30, 1920, 278&#150;9). The second- and third-year theory lectures delivered from the early 1900s until his retirement were likewise written up and published (1929).<br>
<br>Cannan's commitment to teaching at the LSE contrasts with his earlier Oxford years, but he continued to live in Oxford, commuting daily on the train. Lionel Robbins, a student after the First World War, reported that he was a poor, though informative, lecturer, lacking familiarity with modern economic developments  (Robbins, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 83&#150;6)&#151;by which Robbins probably means American and European developments, for Cannan had attended Marshall's lectures in the winter of 1891&#150;2 and demonstrates in <span class="italic">A Review of Economic Theory</span> an easy familiarity with Marshallian principles. Cannan belonged to an earlier age, when historical and practical interests went naturally together. This was also true of his interest in local government, for he was elected by the university to Oxford city council in 1896 and served his city for many years. At the national level his chief engagement was as a critic of economic administration. Anticipating the question &#145;What did you do in the Great War?&#146; in the preface to a collection of occasional pieces and letters dating from the period 1914&#150;26, he responds: &#145;I protested&#146;  (E. Cannan, <span class="italic">An Economist's Protest</span>, 1927, v). War finance and its inflationary domestic impact prompted an interest in earlier debates on paper money, which led to an edition of the 1810 bullion report coupled with a lengthy essay on its historical context entirely within the same combative spirit (1919).<br>
<br>Cannan was a keen gardener and a cyclist who never walked if he could cycle, &#145;at any time prepared to ride a hundred miles, and the story is told that when he failed to find a book at the Bodleian, he merely said &#147;&#151;then I must go on to the British Museum&#148;&#146;  (Bowley, 392). He died on 8 April 1935 of pneumonia and cardiac failure at Bournemouth Hydropathic, Durley Gardens, Bournemouth; his funeral was held on 11 April at Wolvercote, Oxford. He was survived by his wife.<br>
