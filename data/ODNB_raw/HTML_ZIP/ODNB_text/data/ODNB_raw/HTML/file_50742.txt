<span class="headword">Hodgkinson,  William</span>  (1661/2&#150;1731), <span class="occ">merchant and landowner</span>, was probably born at Overton in the parish of Ashover, Derbyshire, where he was baptized on 2 April 1662; he was the second son of George Hodgkinson (<i>d</i>. 1692) of Overton and his wife, Anne. George Hodgkinson's ancestor Richard Hodgkinson had acquired Overton in 1556, although it was later sold, and George himself repurchased the estate in 1641. From at least the mid-sixteenth century, the Hodgkinsons had established themselves in Ashover as parish gentry. Like virtually every north Derbyshire family of the same class in this period, they were involved in the lead trade, sending shipments from Hull (where George Hodgkinson lived for a time) both to London and directly overseas, chiefly to Amsterdam. In common with most Hull merchants, the Hodgkinsons also engaged in trade with Baltic countries, importing iron and, to a lesser extent, tar, flax, timber, and hemp from Sweden, to which they exported small quantities of woollen goods.<br>
<br>William Hodgkinson is unusual in that, alone of provincial Baltic merchants of his generation, a large proportion of his accounts survive, making it possible to amplify through a case study what is known in general about Hull's overseas trade. Fragmentary records exist from 1678, when George Hodgkinson was living in Hull, but the bulk of the material begins in 1684, when William, aged twenty-two, was in Stockholm, working as his father's factor, a conventional training for merchants' sons. He was to remain there until 1689, and in 1687, the year for which his Swedish accounts are best preserved, he shipped approximately 570 tons of bar iron to Hull on behalf of some twenty merchants, including his father and younger brother Obadiah (1666&#150;1732). He also dealt on a smaller scale in other Baltic goods.<br>
<br>On his return to England, William Hodgkinson lived at Hull for about a year but he moved to Overton at the start of 1691. His father, whose heir he became on the death of his elder brother, George, in 1687, died in June 1692. Shortly afterwards William almost completely rebuilt Overton, which remained his home for the rest of his life. His accounts show that he continued to trade through Hull, exporting lead and importing iron and other commodities from Sweden. Most of the iron was consigned to Hull merchants for distribution throughout the adjoining region, but Hodgkinson sold small quantities direct to blacksmiths and nailers in Ashover and the surrounding district. Like most Derbyshire lead merchants, he also had interests in the mining and smelting of lead in several local parishes. Although it cannot be demonstrated from his accounts, William evidently continued his father's practice of acquiring land adjoining Overton and by the beginning of the eighteenth century the Hodgkinsons were probably the most substantial of the various minor gentry families resident in Ashover. They did not appear at Sir William Dugdale's visitation of Derbyshire in 1662, but they were using arms by 1687, if not before. In 1704 William Hodgkinson built and endowed a school at Ashover.<br>
<br>Hodgkinson was married to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1732), the daughter of Robert Ferne of Bonsall, Derbyshire. They had been married for more than thirty (possibly forty) years when he died on 6 December 1731, probably at Overton, his wife surviving him. Although in his will he asked merely to be buried in the churchyard at Ashover, he was interred on 9 December in the church itself, where a monument describes him as one who was &#145;bred a merchant and added considerably to his paternal estate by his industry and frugality, virtues which he practised himself and greatly encouraged in others&#146;. Subject to his wife's life interest, he left his whole estate, including lead mines as well as land, to his grandson William (1719&#150;1761), the second son of his daughter and sole heir, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1730). In 1714 Ann had married Joseph Banks (<i>d</i>. 1741) of Revesby Abbey, Lincolnshire. Under the terms of the bequest, William Banks took the additional surname Hodgkinson, but he gave up both surname and Overton on inheriting Revesby Abbey in 1741. Overton then passed to his younger brother Robert (<i>d</i>. 1792), who also took the Hodgkinson name. On Robert's death Overton was inherited by William's son, the explorer and naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1300/', "Sir Joseph Banks (1743&#150;1820)")</script>.<br>
