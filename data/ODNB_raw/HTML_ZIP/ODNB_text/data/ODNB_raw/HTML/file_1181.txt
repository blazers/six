<span class="headword">Balfour,  Alexander</span>  (1767&#150;1829), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in the parish of Monikie, Forfarshire, Scotland, and was baptized on 1 March 1767 which was possibly also the date of his birth. He was the son of William Balfour and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Honyman. Being a twin, and physically weak, he was cared for by a relative. His education was scanty, and he was early apprenticed to a weaver. Nevertheless, Balfour started writing poetry when he was twelve and was published in the &#145;poets' corner&#146; of local newspapers. Later he taught in a school in his native parish, where his rough and ready but successful teaching was much appreciated.<br>
<br>In 1793 Balfour became one of the clerks of a merchant manufacturer in Arbroath, and in 1794 he married. His writing career continued with poems published in the <span class="italic">British Chronicle</span> newspaper and Anderson's <span class="italic">Bee</span>. In 1793 he was one of the writers in the <span class="italic">Dundee Repository</span> and in 1796 in the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Magazine</span>. In 1797 he changed his employment, but in 1799, on the death of his first employer, he carried on the business in partnership with his widow. On her retirement in 1800 he took another partner, and, having succeeded in obtaining a government contract to supply the navy with canvas, in a few years he possessed considerable property. During the war with France, he published patriotic poems and songs in the <span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span>, which were reprinted in London. He also contributed poems and songs to the <span class="italic">Northern Minstrel</span> of Newcastle upon Tyne, and to the Montrose <span class="italic">Literary Mirror</span>, wrote an account of Arbroath for Brewster's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia</span>, and produced several papers for Tilloch's <span class="italic">Philosophical Journal</span>. In 1814 he moved to Trottick, near Dundee, as manager of a branch of a London house. In the following year it became bankrupt, and Balfour was again thrown on the world. He found inferior employment as manager of a manufacturing establishment at Balgonie, Fife, from 1815 to 1818 and turned to literature as a source of income. <span class="italic">Campbell, or, The Scottish Probationer</span> (1819) was very successful. In the same year, he also edited his friend Richard Gall's <span class="italic">Poems</span> with a memoir.<br>
<br>In October 1818, for the sake of his children's education, Balfour moved to Edinburgh, to work as a clerk in Blackwood's publishing house. Unhappily in the course of a few months he was struck down by paralysis, and in June 1819 was obliged to relinquish his employment. He recovered so far that he could be wheeled about in a specially prepared chair. His intellect was untouched, and he devoted himself to literature. In 1820 he published <span class="italic">Contemplation, and other Poems</span>, in 1822 came his second novel, <span class="italic">Farmer's Three Daughters</span>; and in 1823 <span class="italic">The Foundling of Glenthorn, or, The Smuggler's Cave, a Romance</span>. Though written for the popular press, his novels are characterized by penetrating insight and skilful depiction of character. In 1825 he republished from Constable's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> <span class="italic">Characters Omitted in Crabbe's Parish Register</span>, and his <span class="italic">Highland Mary</span> appeared in 1827. In that year, too, he received a Treasury grant of &pound;100 from Canning. In his last two years he was a voluminous contributor to the <span class="italic">Saturday Evening Post</span>, under the pseudonym of Penseroso, as well as to other periodicals. Many of these articles were posthumously published as <span class="italic">Weeds and Wildflowers</span> (1830).<br>
<br>Balfour died on 12 September 1829 at Lauriston Place, Edinburgh, and was buried on 15 September at the West Church. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and three daughters.<br>
