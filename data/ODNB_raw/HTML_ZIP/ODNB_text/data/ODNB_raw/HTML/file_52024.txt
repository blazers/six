<span class="headword">Hall,  Sydney Prior</span>  (1842&#150;1922), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at All Saints, Newmarket, Suffolk, on 18 October 1842, the eldest son of Harry (Henry) Hall (<i>c</i>.1814&#150;1882), artist, of Newmarket, who painted racehorses and other sporting subjects, and his wife, Ellen Ann Payne. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, and at Pembroke College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship and in 1865 gained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. He also attended the Royal Academy Schools in London. &#145;A gifted draughtsman able to capture natural attitudes and postures with great skill&#146;  (Stewart and Cutten, 226), Hall produced a series of 100 &#145;Oxford sketches&#146; (1864&#150;6) illustrating topical events in the life of the university. The caricatures, which circulated in photographic copies, displayed &#145;a keen sense of the outlook and prejudices&#146; of the primarily undergraduate audience  (Brock and Curthoys, xxi).<br>
<br>Although he was a talented painter in oils and in watercolours, it was as an illustrator that Hall became best-known. With the likes of Luke Fildes and Hubert von Herkomer, he was one of the principal contributors to William Luson Thomas's illustrated weekly <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, which became renowned for its pictorial coverage of world events. Hall was special artist of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> during the Franco-Prussian War (1870&#150;71): his drawings of Paris during the German siege and the commune were dispatched to London by balloon post. A selection of his work from France was published in <span class="italic">Sketches from an Artist's Portfolio</span> (1875), which was dedicated &#145;by special permission&#146; to the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Hall first met the prince of Wales during a bear-hunt in Russia in February 1874, which he sketched, and after summoning up the courage to approach the prince he was peremptorily cut short: &#145;Hush! for God's sake; we expect the bear&#146;  (Hall, <span class="italic">Sketches</span>, 30). The prince later invited Hall to join his suite on his voyage to India in 1875&#150;6; many of the resulting Indian sketches are now at Osborne on the Isle of Wight. Hall also accompanied the marquess of Lorne when he went to Canada as governor-general in 1879. He returned in 1881, as special artist of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, accompanying the marquess on a journey to the north-west territories to promote settlement of the country and raise capital for the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. &#145;To the Great North-West with the Marquis of Lorne&#146;, illustrated with over 100 drawings, ran in <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> from August 1881 to February 1882.<br>
<br>Hall's domestic arrangements were unconventional: for much of the 1870s he lived out of wedlock with Emma Dinah (1846/7&#150;1894), daughter of John Holland, cellarman, at 39 Birkbeck Road, Islington, London. On 30 September 1873 a son was born, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33653/', "Reginald Holland (Harry) Hall")</script>, later assistant keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities at the British Museum. The couple later married at Islington register office, on 14 January 1877, when they were living at 3 Pyrland Villas, Calverley Grove. With Arthur Hughes, Hall illustrated an edition of <span class="italic">Tom Brown's School-Days</span> (1882), and he was the sole illustrator of an edition of the sequel, <span class="italic">Tom Brown at Oxford</span> (1886). He also produced a large number of life studies of public figures, many made in parliament and the law courts, and he was &#145;a penetrating observer&#146; of the notable legal encounters of the day  (Hogarth, 66). &#145;His biggest triumph was a chronicle of over two hundred brilliant off-the-cuff pencil drawings of the Parnell Commission&#146; (1888&#150;9), which appeared as a fifty-page special number of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Among Hall's many pencil drawings in the National Portrait Gallery are studies of Charles Bradlaugh, John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain, Michael Davitt, William Ewart Gladstone, Charles Stewart Parnell, and Oscar Wilde. There are also a number of his oil paintings in the gallery, including <span class="italic">The Duke and Duchess of Teck Receiving Officers of the Indian Contingent, 1882</span> (1883), <span class="italic">The Three Daughters of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra</span> (1883), and a study of Joseph Chamberlain and Arthur James Balfour (<i>c</i>.1895), depicted on the benches of the House of Commons. Hall exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1875: his works included portraits of Indian officers, a portrait of the prince of Wales at Baroda, <span class="italic">The Marriage of HRH the Duke of Connaught KG</span>, and <span class="italic">Mr Gladstone Playing his Evening Game of Backgammon</span>. His sensitive oil study of an Oxford viva voce, <span class="italic">We Pause for a Reply</span>, was originally given the title <span class="italic">Dominus illuminatio mea</span> when exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1895. Hall also exhibited fourteen works at the Grosvenor Gallery. A watercolour of the progress of the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> in the House of Lords was reproduced in <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> of 13 December 1902. Hall is pictured in the group portrait <span class="italic">Primrose Hill School</span> (1893), by an unknown artist, alongside, among others, Sir Ernest Albert Waterlow and Arthur Hopkins.<br>
<br>In 1901 Hall was a member of the suite of the duke and duchess of York, and special artist of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, on board HMS <i>Ophir</i>. He was created MVO that year. After the death of his first wife he married second, on 4 August 1906, Mary Lightbody (1851&#150;1929), the daughter of James Gow, painter. The artist Andrew Carrick Gow (1848&#150;1920) was her brother. Mary Gow too was a painter, mostly producing figures and genre in watercolours, and she exhibited widely, principally at Suffolk Street, where she sent eighteen works between 1869 and 1880. She was represented at the Royal Academy from 1873, and her <span class="italic">Marie-Antoinette</span> was purchased under the Chantrey bequest in 1908. She was elected a member of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1875. Sydney Prior Hall died at his London home, 36 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, on 15 December 1922. He was survived by his wife.<br>
