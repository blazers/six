<span class="headword">Thomson,  George</span>  (1799&#150;1886), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, second of six sons of George Thomson of Fairley, Aberdeenshire, formerly purser, East India Company service, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Bailie John Dingwall of Rannieston, Aberdeenshire, was born at Fairley on 19 September 1799. He was educated by a private tutor and at Addiscombe College (1814&#150;16), and passed out in October 1816 as an engineer cadet for the Bengal service. He arrived at Calcutta on 18 September 1818, and went to Cawnpore. In 1820 he joined the recently formed Corps of Bengal Sappers and Miners, commanded by Major Thomas Anburey, at Allahabad. On 28 January 1821 he took command of the detachment of sappers at Asirgarh. In 1822 he was constructing a road between Asirgarh and Nagpur, and later between Nagpur and Chapra. From March to June 1823 he was dismantling and blowing up the fort of Mandla. He was appointed adjutant of the Bengal Sappers and Miners on 29 May, and on 5 September he was promoted lieutenant.<br>
<br>In March 1824 war was declared with Burma, and in September Thomson went to Calcutta to join the pioneer department, for active service under Captain Schalch. On 14 December he left Calcutta for Chittagong, where a force of 11,000 men, under Brigadier-General Morrison of the 44th foot, had been assembled to penetrate to Ava through Arakan. Thomson was appointed field engineer to the force and placed in command of the pontoon train. On 10 January 1825 he started with Morrison's force by a route along the sea-coast, and, after crossing the Mayu estuary, a little to the west of the modern port of Akyab, advanced north-east through difficult country, and crossed the Kaladan or Great Arakan River. Thomson was almost always in front on reconnaissance, and, the forests being too thick and the rivers too deep to allow any other way of travelling, he went on foot and suffered greatly from fatigue. The approach to Arakan lay across a narrow valley, bounded by a range of hills crowned with stockades and garrisoned by 9000 Burmese. An attack on 29 March failed, but on 1 April Thomson assisted in the assault and capture of the stockades, and Arakan was taken. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1825 Thomson was appointed executive engineer, south-eastern division, of the public works department, and he was busy with the erection of cantonments in Arakan at the close of the rainy season. The division suffered very heavily from the unhealthy climate. Thomson was sent to survey and report upon the best situation in the islands near the mouth of the Beatong River for cantoning the division. He returned to Bengal in September 1826.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1826 Thomson was appointed executive engineer in the public works department at Neemuch, and was employed in building a fort there. He was promoted captain in the Bengal Engineers on 28 September 1827. On 6 December he was appointed to the Bengal Sappers and Miners, and on 21 February 1828 he returned to the public works department as executive engineer of the Rohilkhand division. In February 1829 he took furlough to Europe. He married in Aberdeen on 4 February 1830 Anna (1812/13&#150;1900), daughter of Alexander Dingwall of Rannieston, Aberdeenshire, postmaster of Aberdeen, and they had several children.<br>
<br>Thomson returned to India in November 1831. On 9 December 1831 he was appointed to survey the country between Bankura and Shirghatti, and to estimate the cost of constructing a road from Jemor to the Karamnasa River. He was next placed in charge of the construction of the grand trunk road between Burdwan and Benares. In 1834 he had the additional task of constructing barracks at Hazaribagh for a European regiment; in this work, despite occasional conflict with the authorities, he adopted successful methods of his own for using convict labour.<br>
<br>In March 1837 Thomson was appointed to command the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Delhi, and to be at the same time executive engineer of the Delhi division of the public works department, a combination which he did not think was for the good of the service. On 13 September 1838 he was selected to be chief engineer of the army of the Indus assembling at Karnal for the invasion of Afghanistan. He marched from Delhi with two companies of sappers and miners on 20 October to Karnal, thence on 9 November to Ferozepore, and on to Bahawalpur (230 miles), where he arrived on 29 December. Rohri, on the left bank of the Indus, was reached on 24 January 1839, and the fort of Bukkur, on a rocky island between Rohri and Sukkur, on the right bank, was seized without opposition on 29 January, and preparations made by Thomson to bridge the river. The channel between Rohri and Bukkur was some 360 yards wide, and that between Bukkur and Sukkur about 130 yards, and in both the water ran very fast. Thomson had asked the political officer to assemble at Rohri materials for bridging, but when he arrived none were there. By great exertion he procured boats, cut down and split palm trees, made grass cables, constructed anchors of small trees joined together and loaded with stone, made nails on the spot, and in eleven days completed an effective pontoon bridge: a notable achievement for which he was rightly praised.<br>
<br>Thomson's services were of value in the long march through the Bolan Pass to Kandahar, which was reached at the end of April. On 27 June the march was resumed. Reports by the political officers of the weakness of Ghazni had induced the commander of the expedition, Sir John Keane, to leave his small battering train at Kandahar, but on arriving at Ghazni on 21 July he found it to be a formidable fortress which could be besieged only with a regular battering train. Thomson proposed to storm it, dash to the Kabul gate, blow it in, and admit the storming party. This was successfully done by Lieutenant H. M. Durand and others on 23 July. In the assault Thomson had a narrow escape. Keane, in his dispatch, ascribed to Thomson &#145;much of the credit of the success of this brilliant <i>coup de main</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 30 Oct 1839). For this Thomson was promoted brevet major, dated from the capture of Ghazni. His account, &#145;Storming of Ghazni&#146;, and a description of his Indus Bridge by Lieutenant H. M. Durand, were published in the <span class="italic">Professional Papers of the Corps of the Royal Engineers</span> (1840).<br>
<br>The march to Kabul was resumed on 30 July, and it was occupied on 7 August. Thomson made an expedition over the mountains to Bamian to reconnoitre the route. In November he returned to India with some of the troops. For his services in the war Thomson received the thanks of the government and was made a CB, military division (December 1839), and from Shah Shuja received the order of the Durani empire (second class).<br>
<br>Thomson resumed the duties of the command of the Bengal Sappers and Miners, and of those of the public works department at Delhi; but, as he found them incompatible, a warm correspondence ensued with the military board, which resulted in Thomson's retiring from the service on 25 January 1841, despite Lord Auckland's efforts to dissuade him. He believed he had been unjustly treated by the board, and resigned disgusted at this. His health had suffered and he had lost several children; also his brother John (1801&#150;1840), captain, Bengal Engineers, had died on 12 August 1840 and left him a considerable bequest. Before leaving India he submitted to the government suggestions for the improvement of the Bengal Sappers and Miners.<br>
<br>Thomson joined a brother in business in Liverpool; but this did not prosper, he lost money, and on 24 July 1844 he was glad to accept from the East India Company the appointment of recruiting officer and paymaster of soldiers' pensions in the Cork district, with the local rank of major. The former post he held until the company ended in 1861, and the latter until 1877, when he resigned and settled in Dublin. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1854. He became a director of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company of Ireland in 1846, and was practically the inspecting director, superintending the completion of the southern portion of the line and of the tunnel into Cork. He was tall, wiry, and &#145;a favourite in society&#146;  (Vibart, 333). He died at his residence, 33 Leeson Park, Dublin, on 11 February 1886. His eldest son, Hugh Gordon, born on 21 November 1830, became major-general of the Indian staff corps, and died on 23 May 1910.<br>
