<span class="headword">Hill,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1735), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the youngest son of a London Turkey merchant, Francis Hill, and his wife, Elizabeth, the second daughter and coheir of Sir John Jenyns, of St Albans. His sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18261/', "Abigail, Lady Masham")</script>, was a favourite of Queen Anne. The collapse of Francis Hill's business ventures reduced his children to a condition of dependence upon the patronage of their cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5405/', "Sarah Churchill, later duchess of Marlborough")</script>. The duchess clothed Jack (the name by which John was commonly known) and sent him to St Albans grammar school (1690&#150;91), and thereafter used her influence at court as confidante to the future queen, Princess Anne, to find him a place&#151;first in 1692 as a page to Prince George and then in 1698 as one of the grooms to the bedchamber in the duke of Gloucester's household. After the duke's death Sarah had him transferred back to Prince George's household for a brief period in 1700. Hill's elder sister Abigail was also found a position within the royal household.<br>
<br>Under the Marlborough influence Hill was commissioned a captain in the Grenadier Guards in November 1702 and in 1703 was appointed adjutant-general to the forces sent to Portugal. In May 1705 he was given the colonelcy of the 11th foot (the late Lord Stanhope's regiment) upon their return from Spain, having formed part of the garrison at Portalegre which capitulated in 1704. Hill's colonelcy owed as much to his sister's rising position at Queen Anne's court as to the Marlborough influence. The regiment was returned to full strength and in 1706 formed part of the expedition against the French coast under Earl Rivers, which was abandoned and sent to Lisbon. In 1707 Hill re-embarked with his regiment for Valencia and the onset of the campaign which culminated in the battle of Almanza. During the battle the 9th and 36th regiments were brigaded with the 11th under Hill's command and, although not immediately engaged, were led forward by Hill to stem the French advance and allow the remnants of the British force to make an orderly retreat. Hill, along with his regiment, was captured and taken prisoner.<br>
<br>Having secured his parole and returned to England, Hill re-formed the regiment, which was sent to the Netherlands in the summer of 1708 to reinforce Marlborough's command. During 1709 it took part in the siege of Mons. On 26 September Hill was ordered to take his troops and break new ground close to the enemies' palisades, and he had to beat off a determined sally from the besieged fortress, with the loss of 150 killed or maimed&#151;including Hill himself, who was injured in the attack.<br>
<br>By 1710 Hill's sister, now Lady Masham, had supplanted the duchess of Marlborough in the affections of the queen, and she used her position at court, together with her alliance with Robert Harley, reputed to be a cousin, to undermine the position of Marlborough and at the same time secure her brother's continued advancement. At the behest of Harley, Queen Anne proposed Hill for the vacant colonelcy of the late earl of Essex's regiment of dragoons. Marlborough, who, according to his duchess, had never rated Hill as a soldier, refused the commission on the grounds that the imposition of a younger officer with influence, over the claims of more experienced and deserving men, would weaken his authority and undermine morale. Relations with the queen rapidly deteriorated, and the duke was unable to resist the queen's subsequent demand in April that Hill be promoted brigadier-general. In May, Hill was further recompensed with a pension of &pound;1000 per annum, to be held during the queen's lifetime. In parliament Marlborough overreached himself. An attempt by the whigs to have Lady Masham removed from court only strengthened the queen's search for a new ministry. Marlborough's political demise can be traced to this episode.<br>
<br>Hill was elected a tory MP for the Cornish pocket borough of Lostwithiel in 1710, which seat he held until 1713. In the Commons he was fairly inactive, although, as the duchess of Marlborough mentioned in one of her more acerbic comments:<blockquote>when Mr Harley thought it useful to attack the Duke of Marlborough in Parliament &hellip; this honest Jack Hill, this once ragged Boy, whom I clothed, happening to be sick in bed, was nevertheless persuaded by his sister to get up, wrapped himself in warmer cloathes &hellip; to go to the House to vote against the Duke. (Green, 120&#150;21)</blockquote>Such now was the political enmity which existed between cousins.Hill's close connections with the Harley administration brought him further promotion. In 1711 Henry St John revived the plan for an expedition to take Quebec and, to gain the queen and Abigail Masham's support, proposed Hill as the commander-in-chief. Marlborough's powers of promotion had been placed in the hands of a board under the duke of Ormond and advancement was given to those who opposed the duke. Hill was duly dispatched in April 1711 with a force of 6000 men. However, on account of poor navigation in bad weather the expedition came to grief, without a shot being fired, in the St Lawrence River with the loss of 800 men, and it returned to England. Jonathan Swift, a close social and political confidant of Hill, reported that he was &#145;privately blamed by his own friends for want of conduct. He called a Council of War, and therein it was determined to come back&#146;  (Swift, 9 Oct 1711). This apparent lack of leadership was doubtless a sad confirmation to Marlborough, yet the expedition's miscarriage did not prevent Hill's continued rise, socially and professionally, during the tory administration.<br>
<br>In June 1712 Hill was made lieutenant-general of the ordnance (having failed to win the governorship of the Tower) and was given command of the force sent to garrison Dunkirk upon the treaty of Utrecht. The governorship of Dunkirk was a further favour from St John, who sought to strengthen his position through the appointment of friends. In July 1712 Hill was promoted major-general and in November he returned to London to be sworn a member of the privy council. He did not stand for election in 1713, perhaps due to talk of a peerage, never realized.<br>
<br>In London, Hill's conviviality, a source of some strain to his personal health, was recognized by his election to the board of brothers, or &#145;society&#146;, as Swift termed a small congenial club of men of wit, learning, or influence formed by himself and St John. From Dunkirk, Hill maintained his connections with Swift through the gift of a snuff-box, of which the recipient declared, &#145;'tis allowed at court, that none in England comes near to it&#146;  (Swift, 7 Aug 1712 and 12 Aug 1712). A gathering of the club hosted by Hill at his London house in January 1713 was described by Swift as &#145;the greatest dinner I have ever seen&#146;  (ibid., 25 Jan 1713). In February 1714 Hill was instructed to return to Dunkirk in his capacity of commissioner to inspect the fortifications, but he was present in Whitehall in August for the accession of George I.<br>
<br>Upon the Hanoverian succession Hill lost all his offices, although his commission as major-general was renewed. He sold the colonelcy of his regiment in July 1715 and went into retirement. Both he and his sister retained their tory political sympathies and support for Bolingbroke, who was rumoured to be at Hill's London house for meetings with friends in 1717  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 56, 5.236). Hill remained unmarried, living at his seat at Egham, on the borders of Berkshire and Surrey, and his London house in Jermyn Street, where he died on 19 or 22 June 1735, some months after his sister. He left his estate to his nephew Samuel, second Baron Masham.<br>
<br>Hill's military career, which owed little to personal merit, offers an insight into the politics of Queen Anne's court, where first the influence of his cousin, the duchess of Marlborough, and later that of his sister propelled forward his career and social advancement. His career, moreover, played a prominent role in the downfall of the duke of Marlborough.<br>
