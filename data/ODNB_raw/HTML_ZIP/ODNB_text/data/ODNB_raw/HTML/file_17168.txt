<span class="headword">Luke,  Stephen</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1829), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Penzance, Cornwall, and baptized at Madron on 4 June 1763, the second son of Stephen Luke (<i>b</i>. 1727/8), of Madron, and his wife, Margaret Trewarvas. He was educated at the school of the Revd James Parker, before being apprenticed to Richard Moyle, apothecary, of Marazion, near Penzance, and he subsequently studied medicine in London and Paris for three years and became a member of the Company of Surgeons in London. While in Paris he became the pupil of the celebrated surgeon Pierre-Joseph Desault, whom he never ceased to hold in the highest esteem.<br>
<br>After a short period of practice in London, Luke returned to Cornwall. He practised at Helston, where he entered into partnership with Zachary John, a surgeon apothecary, and afterwards with Isaac Heard. He married Harriet Vyvyan (<i>bap</i>. 1758?), daughter of Philip Puron Vyvyan of South Petherwin, Cornwall, probably in 1792, and in the same year he obtained the degree of MD from the University of Aberdeen. He then settled as a physician at Falmouth, where he was elected mayor in 1797. Luke was captain of the Pendennis volunteer cavalry in the same year and he was the original promoter of the Pendennis artillery volunteers.<br>
<br>Luke remained at Falmouth for seventeen years, and was said to have attained a large practice and the highest reputation in the county of Cornwall. According to Munk his health had never been very robust and in 1808 he decided to leave Falmouth to enter Jesus College, Cambridge; he then moved to Edinburgh for the session 1808&#150;9. He practised at Exeter from 1811, and about 1815 returned to Cambridge where it was said that he was instrumental in saving the life of Dr Pearce, the master of his college, who had suffered from an apoplectic attack. Having been an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians since 23 July 1806, he was admitted a licentiate of the college on 26 June 1815, and took a house in Cavendish Square, London. He graduated MB at Cambridge later in 1815 and MD in 1821. In 1828 he was made physician-extraordinary to George IV.<br>
<br>Luke was said to be remarkable for his prompt and accurate perception of the seat and cause of disease, imparting a boldness and decisiveness of action that was generally successful. He was well known for his gentlemanly manners and his tenderness and solicitude in the sick room. He also contributed an essay on nitrous acid in dropsy to Thomas Beddoes's <span class="italic">Contributions to Physical and Medical Knowledge</span> (1799), detailing a single case of cirrhosis of the liver in which, after tapping, nitrous acid was of use as a diuretic; and he added &#145;Observations on the diseases of Cornwall&#146; to Richard Polwhele's <span class="italic">History of Cornwall</span> (1806).<br>
<br>Luke died at his house in Cavendish Square, London, on 30 March 1829.<br>
