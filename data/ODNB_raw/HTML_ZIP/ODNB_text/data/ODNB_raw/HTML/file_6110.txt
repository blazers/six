<span class="headword">Constable, Sir  Robert</span>  (1478?&#150;1537), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, of Flamborough, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, was probably born in 1478, the eldest of four sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6108/', "Sir Marmaduke Constable (1456/7?&#150;1518)")</script>, soldier and administrator, and his wife, Joyce, the daughter of Sir Humphrey Stafford of Grafton, Cheshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6109/', "Sir Marmaduke Constable the younger")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6108/', "Constable, Sir Marmaduke (1456/?&#150;1518)")</script>] was his brother. By his marriage to Jane, daughter of Sir William Ingleby of Ripley, Yorkshire, Constable had three sons and four (or possibly five) daughters.<br>
<br>Little is known of Constable's early life and education. From his early career, however, it seems likely that he was trained as a soldier and retained a preference for the traditional militaristic pursuits of his class. He was in the royal army which defeated the Cornish rebels at Blackheath and was knighted on the battlefield on 17 June 1497. In 1511 he took part in the short-lived military expedition against the Moors led by Thomas Darcy, Baron Darcy, undertaken at the request of Ferdinand of Spain. Two years later he participated in the battle of Flodden, alongside his father, brothers, and other kinsmen. Constable forged increasingly close connections with the court at this time, where, by 1517, he had been appointed knight of the body.<br>
<br>Upon the death of his father in 1518, Constable succeeded to the considerable estates centred on the principal family seat of Flamborough. Thereafter he continued to participate in the administration of his locality. He was JP and commissioner of array for the East Riding from the early 1500s until the outbreak of the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536. In the early 1530s he was also sworn of the king's council of the north, which had been newly reconstituted following the downfall of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, archbishop of York. His influence in the region was augmented by his appointment to a number of stewardships, including those of the crown lordships of Sheriff Hutton (which he was required to relinquish in 1532) and Hotham and the Percy lordships of Leconfield and Pocklington, all in Yorkshire. He was also steward of the Yorkshire liberty of Howden for Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Durham.<br>
<br>By nature Constable was volatile and noted for his &#145;dangerous disposition&#146;  (Dodds and Dodds, 1.46). In the early 1520s his feuds were among those which, within Yorkshire, created much dissension and he was called to account for his behaviour before Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, Henry VIII's lieutenant in the north. In 1525 he obtained a royal pardon for his &#145;riotous&#146; abduction of a royal ward  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/1, no. 1115). In the early 1530s, as a result of his involvement in further disputes, he made several appearances before the court of Star Chamber. In 1534 Constable's unseemly behaviour led to calls for his dismissal from the commission of the peace.<br>
<br>The precise motivation behind Constable's rebellious participation in the Pilgrimage of Grace is not clear. His family had long been tenants and clients of the earls of Northumberland, who had extensive landed interests in the East Riding and Constable was a member of the council of Henry Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland. Percy affinities undoubtedly played a part in the rebellion and this, to some extent, may have accounted for Constable's stance. Other factors, such as his increasing dissatisfaction with the aims of royal government, may also have played a part. In religious matters, too, he, along with his old friends Darcy and John Hussey, Baron Hussey, maintained a traditional stance. In 1534 all three men had agreed upon their aversion towards heresy and their determination to die as &#145;Christian men&#146;.<br>
<br>Whatever his ultimate motivation&#151;and despite his initial reluctance and claims that he was coerced&#151;Constable was quickly drawn into the pilgrimage and soon became one of its leaders. He adopted, in the first instance, a resolutely rebellious stance but subsequently went on to accept a royal pardon under the terms of the agreement reached at Doncaster in early December 1536. During Sir Francis Bigod's revolt in January 1537, Constable strove to stay the commons and maintain order, in accordance with the December agreement. Nevertheless, the resurgence of the rebellion provided the crown with the opportunity to take reprisals against the rebel leaders. Constable, together with other leading pilgrims, was summoned to London where he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and subsequently indicted, not for his activities in the main phase of the rebellion, but for offences allegedly committed after his pardon. Following his trial and condemnation, Constable was taken to Hull for execution. On 6 July 1537, he was taken to the town's Beverley Gate and there hanged in chains.<br>
