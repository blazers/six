<span class="headword">Pory,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1572, <em>d.</em> 1633), <span class="occ">writer and colonial administrator</span>, was baptized at Thompson, Norfolk, on 16 March 1572, the son of William Pory (<i>d</i>. 1606?) and his wife, whose maiden name was probably Marsham. He entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1588, graduated BA in 1592, proceeded MA in 1595, and between 1595 and 1597 taught Greek at his college. He was married and had one daughter but further details of his family are unknown.<br>
<br>Pory then became assistant to Richard Hakluyt, who called him his &#145;very honest, industrious, and learned friend&#146; and for three years encouraged him in the study of cosmography, reckoning him of &#145;special skill and extraordinary hope to performe great matters in the same, and beneficial for the common wealth&#146;  (Hakluyt, vol. 3, dedication). At Hakluyt's instigation Pory published his translation, with notes of his own, of <span class="italic">A Geographical Historie of Africa, Written in Arabicke and Italian by John Leo, a More</span> (1601). In 1602 Pory edited <span class="italic">An Epitome of Ortelius his Theatre of the World</span>, his reputation for learning and knowledge of modern languages gaining him on 18 April 1610 incorporation as MA at Oxford.<br>
<br>Pory represented Bridgwater, Somerset, in parliament from 1605 to 1611; he had been elected on the day that the Gunpowder Plot had been discovered, and he took his seat in January 1606. In these years his patrons were Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, to whom he had dedicated his history of Africa, and, more particularly, Sir Walter Cope, whom John Chamberlain termed his &#145;great-master&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.279). By 1606 Pory had begun the letter-writing to friends which later provided him with a second career. Among his early correspondents were Sir Robert Cotton and Dudley Carleton, fellow MPs, and the diplomats Sir Ralph Winwood and Sir Thomas Edmondes. In 1609 he was named in the second charter of the Virginia Company.<br>
<br>On 21 May 1611 Pory was authorized to travel for three years, though in reality he spent much of the next fourteen years overseas. In June he sought Carleton's support for a scheme to introduce silk-loom stocking weaving into England; he was in Ireland from July to September with George, Lord Carew, and at the end of the year accompanied him to Paris. There in January 1612 he delivered to Cardinal Du Perron a treatise written by Isaac Casaubon and Lancelot Andrewes, bishop of Ely, in answer to a letter from the cardinal to the king, and he handed De Thou, the historian, materials collected for his use by William Camden. In September he attended a disputation between Daniel Featley and Richard Smith, the future bishop of Chalcedon, an occasion of which he later wrote an account, <span class="italic">The Summe and Substance of a Disputation</span> (1630).<br>
<br>In 1613 Pory went from Paris, via Turin&#151;where he fell into debt and was said to be &#145;too much in love with the pot&#146;  (Neill, 135&#150;6)&#151;Padua, and Messina, to Constantinople, where he served Sir Paul Pindar, the ambassador. While in the city Pory translated into Italian for the Venetian ambassador King James's <span class="italic">Declaration &hellip; pour le droit des rois et ind&eacute;pendance de leurs couronnes, contre la harangue de l'illustrissime Cardinal Du Perron</span>, first published in London in French in 1615.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1616&#150;17 Pory brought home dispatches from Constantinople and in 1617 and 1618 acted as a diplomatic courier to Italy and the Netherlands. In the autumn of 1618 Carleton offered Pory employment at The Hague but he declined, having already accepted as his patron Robert, Lord Rich, elder brother to Sir Henry Rich, who in 1612 had married Isobel Cope, Sir Walter's heir. In these years, but not thereafter, Pory's drinking was matter for comment, and it was probably at this time that Pory became a professional intelligencer.<br>
<br>On 27 November 1618 the Virginia Company, on Lord Rich's recommendation, appointed Pory secretary in Virginia for three years, his recompense to be derived from fees and the assignment to him of company tenants. Sailing in January 1619 with the new governor, Sir George Yeardley, whose wife was Pory's cousin, he reached Virginia on 19 April. As the colony's secretary, Pory was a member of the council in Jamestown. He also acted as speaker of the 1619 session (30 July to 4 August) of the general assembly, the first meeting of an elected representative body in the English colonies. Pory also travelled the colony, establishing his tenants on the eastern shore, exploring the Potomac River to the north and, after his term as secretary had ended in November 1621, the Chowan River to the south.<br>
<br>In 1622 Pory sailed for England, by way of Plymouth Colony in New England. In the Azores the vessel carrying him was wrecked. Arrested by Portuguese officials, he was accused of piracy and in danger of execution, but by August 1623 he was in London. Almost immediately he returned to Virginia as one of the commissioners investigating the state of the colony. After three months of not uncontroversial activity he left in late April 1624, reaching England with the commissioners' report early in June. As a reward in July he received &pound;150 and appointment to the new commission for Virginia.<br>
<br>In 1624 the reprinting of his <span class="italic">Geographical Historie</span> by Samuel Purchas in part two of his <span class="italic">Pilgrimes</span> gained Pory some celebrity. He resumed his career as a professional intelligencer, apparently working from the London print shop of Nathaniel Butter and Nicholas Bourne, the coranto publishers. Among his correspondents were Joseph Mead, Sir Thomas Puckering, Viscount Scudamore, Sir Thomas Lucy, and Lord Brooke; Lord Scudamore paid him &pound;20 a year. His last known letter is dated 24 January 1633. He was buried at St Lawrence Jewry, London, on 26 July 1633.<br>
