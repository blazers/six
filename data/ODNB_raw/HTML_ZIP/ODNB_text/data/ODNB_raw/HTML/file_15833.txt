<span class="headword">Kitson, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1485&#150;1540), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was born in Warton, Lancashire, the son of Robert Kitson. He was apprenticed to Richard Glasyer, a mercer and merchant adventurer of London, and became free of the City in 1507. He was already trading on his own account on a substantial scale in 1509, and his accounts show that he remained active as a merchant adventurer until his death. In 1534&#150;5, when he exported 625 cloths, only ten merchants exported larger quantities. He dealt mainly in the broadcloths of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Somerset, but also traded on a more limited scale in the coarser Lancashire cottons, Welsh frises, and coarse woollen Kendal penistones, and he cultivated close connections with clothiers in these areas, among them John Clyfflide of Beckington, Thomas Davy of Warminster, Richard Earl of Melksham, and Gilbert Sariscold of Manchester. His imports of fustians, velvets, linens, and spices were typical of the merchant adventurers, although in the 1530s most of the profits of his cloth sales were repatriated by bills of exchange, his exports in that decade being valued at &pound;44,416 compared with imports of only &pound;10,906. His profits on the export of cloth have been calculated as being of the order of 15 to 20 per cent, and, although the profit margins on imports were probably much lower, he accumulated a substantial fortune.<br>
<br>Kitson's wealth was such that it was rumoured in the City that he had been responsible for the scale of Cardinal Wolsey's fiscal demands in 1522: &#145;it was mych long of me that the cete prest so grete a sum at this tyme&#146;  (CUL, Hengrave Hall deposit, MS 88(1), no. 1). The citizens seem to have retaliated by assessing him harshly, for his assessment was altered from 1000 marks to 4000 marks. Perhaps the assessment of 1535 that his goods were worth 4000 marks (&pound;2666) was near the truth, for the inventory taken on his death valued his net estate at &pound;3142 17<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. His rising prosperity was marked by his acquisition of properties in Suffolk, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, and Nottinghamshire. His most important purchase was the manor of Hengrave in Suffolk, bought from the duke of Buckingham, together with the manor of Colston Basset in Nottinghamshire, for &pound;2340 in 1521, shortly before the duke's attainder. It was at Hengrave that Kitson built the splendid mansion which still survives. More than &pound;3500 was spent on building works there between 1525 and 1539; the house was graced with an avant-garde oriel window incorporating several Renaissance features, and its chapel was decorated with stained glass probably imported from France. Kitson retained a house in London in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, as well as a suburban residence at Stoke Newington, Middlesex.<br>
<br>As a young man Kitson had shown a reluctance to participate in the affairs of his livery company, being forced to spend a night in prison in 1509 for his refusal to serve among the bachelors and attend on the presentation of the new mayor at the exchequer, but his civic career was otherwise conventional. He served as sheriff of London in 1533&#150;4, and on 28 July 1534 was elected alderman of Castle Baynard ward, where he remained until his death. He was a warden of the Mercers' Company in 1525&#150;6 and 1533&#150;4, and served as master in 1534&#150;5. He was knighted in 1533.<br>
<br>The identity of Kitson's first wife is unknown, although there was a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Edmund Crofts of Westowe in Suffolk. His second wife was Margaret (1510&#150;1561) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/75935">Bourchier,  Margaret</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/73910">Kitson family</a>]. She was the only child of John Donnington (<i>d</i>. 1544) of Stoke Newington, a member of the Salters' Company of London, and his wife, Elizabeth Pye. From this marriage he had a posthumous son, Thomas, and four daughters. His widow, Dame Margaret, was an attractive catch for Sir Richard Long (<i>d</i>. 1546), a gentleman of the privy chamber, and she remarried within two months of her husband's death. In 1548 she took as her third husband John Bourchier, second earl of Bath (1489&#150;1561). She commissioned the lavish tomb with effigies of herself and her husbands which can still be seen in Hengrave church. Kitson's four daughters all seem to have made advantageous marriages: Catherine to Sir John Spencer of Wormleighton in Warwickshire, Dorothy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68014/', "Tasburgh, Dorothy")</script>] to Sir Thomas Packington of Aylesbury, Frances to John Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarine, and Anne to Sir William Spring of Pakenham in Suffolk. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75934/', "Sir Thomas Kitson (1540&#150;1603)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73910/', "Kitson family")</script>], was briefly (1557&#150;8) married to Jane, the daughter of William, Lord Paget, but acquired a firm ally in Sir Thomas Cornwallis by marrying his daughter Elizabeth in 1560 [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/75936">Kitson,  Elizabeth</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/73910">Kitson family</a>]. Although conforming to the Elizabethan settlement, he was associated with the conservatives among the Suffolk gentry.<br>
<br>Kitson died at Hengrave on 11 September 1540 and was buried in Hengrave church. The brevity of his will makes it difficult to determine his religious inclinations, but he seems to have been aligned with the more conservative clergy. He had numerous business dealings with John Kite, bishop of Carlisle, to whose will he was overseer, and his funeral sermon was preached by Dr Nicholas Wilson, the arch-conservative rector of St Thomas the Apostle in London.<br>
