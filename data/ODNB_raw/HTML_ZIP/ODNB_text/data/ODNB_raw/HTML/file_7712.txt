<span class="headword">Dobbs,  Francis</span>  (1750&#150;1811), <span class="occ">politician and barrister</span>, was born on 27 April 1750, the third son of Richard Dobbs, Church of Ireland clergyman, of Lisburn, co. Antrim, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1775), daughter of William Young and widow of Cornet McManus; he was the nephew of Arthur Dobbs, sometime governor of North Carolina. As a young man he devoted himself to literary pursuits but soon became engrossed in military affairs. He purchased an ensigncy at the age of eighteen in the 63rd regiment and subsequently became lieutenant and adjutant. In 1773 he left the army and entered the Middle Temple, London. In the same year he married Jane Stewart, daughter of Alexander Stewart of Ballintoy, co. Antrim, and Acton, co. Armagh, and later settled on the Acton property as its agent. They had six sons and one daughter. In 1774 he wrote a play called <span class="italic">The Patriot King, or, The Irish Chief</span>, which was published in London and performed in the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, and Belfast.<br>
<br>After being called to the Irish bar in 1775 Dobbs took a keen interest in the political life of Ireland and published a number of political pamphlets during the agitation for Irish legislative independence and parliamentary reform. He also kept a close eye on the activities of the reform movement in England and was in regular contact with leading English radical figures such as Major John Cartwright. He was an influential member of the volunteer movement in Ulster and was captain of the Tyrone's Ditches and Acton Volunteers. He believed that the extra-parliamentary pressure which the volunteers had brought to bear on the British government to grant a &#145;free trade&#146; to Ireland in 1779 should be applied again to win legislative independence for Ireland. He was also a member of the Monks of the Order of St Patrick, sometimes known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96301', "Monks of the Screw")</script>, a political and convivial society founded in September 1779, whose primary object was to win a constitution for Ireland. Dobbs pursued this goal with vigour and his activities soon came to the attention of British as well as Irish politicians. Indeed, his radical views on Ireland's legal right to make her own laws were commented upon by Lord George Gordon in the British parliament in January 1780.<br>
<br>Dobbs later became a major in the southern battalion of the 1st Ulster regiment, which, in December 1781, called on every volunteer company in Ulster to send elected delegates to Dungannon on 15 February 1782 to propose and discuss resolutions in support of Irish legislative independence. The resolutions to be considered by the volunteer convention were drawn up in advance by Lord Charlemont, with the assistance of a few other patriots. However, parliamentary duties, or a wish not to influence proceedings unduly, led to the absence of the patriot parliamentarians, and it was Charlemont's close friend and political ally Dobbs who was the main spokesman at the convention.<br>
<br>Dobbs's involvement with the volunteers continued after &#145;the constitution of 1782&#146; had been achieved. He was one of a carefully selected group of volunteer delegates who met as a national committee in Dublin on 18 June 1782 and declared their support for Henry Grattan's view that the &#145;simple repeal&#146; of the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span>  (6 Geo. I c. 5) was a sufficient guarantee of Ireland's constitutional security. But cracks were beginning to appear in the fa&ccedil;ade of volunteer unity. The Belfast volunteer companies took umbrage at this stage-management and declared that they would make up their own minds about the sufficiency of &#145;simple repeal&#146;. Dobbs took this as an affront, and in a series of angry clashes with the Belfast volunteer companies brought the constitutional dispute down to the level of a personal confrontation. Henceforth the Belfast volunteers allied themselves with Grattan's rival, Henry Flood, who argued that Ireland would never be free until the British parliament renounced all rights to interfere in Irish legislation. Worse was to follow for Dobbs. He was refused admission to the third Dungannon convention, which met on 8 September 1783, because he had accepted a commission in the fencibles&#151;regiments of soldiers raised locally for home service that were commanded by local landowners and armed and paid for by the government.<br>
<br>After the &#145;renunciation&#146; dispute Dobbs turned for a time from politics and became consumed with a belief in the millennium. In 1787 he published four large volumes of a <span class="italic">Universal history, commencing at the creation and ending at the death of Christ, in letters from a father to his son</span>, in which he exerted himself to prove historically the exact fulfilment of the Messianic prophecies. He also published in 1788 a volume of poems, most of which had appeared in various periodicals. His interest in politics was renewed briefly in 1793 when he joined the Association of the Friends of the People, a political club founded by the second duke of Leinster, which sought to promote the cause of parliamentary reform. He also continued to pursue his career as a practising barrister with some success. His services were engaged regularly and he dealt with a wide range of cases. In 1798 he acted as a negotiator for some of the captured United Irishmen because, as Leslie Hale states, he was &#145;a barrister respected by both sides, whose political activities were always honourable&#146;  (Hale, 189).<br>
<br>Dobbs made a decisive political comeback in 1797 when he was returned to the Irish House of Commons for Lord Charlemont's borough of Charlemont in co. Armagh. He delivered an important speech and submitted five propositions for tranquillizing the country which were published in 1799. However, the success of that speech was quite overshadowed by the enormous popularity of his great speech delivered against the bill for a legislative union with Great Britain on 7 June 1800, of which, it is said, 30,000 copies were immediately sold. The popularity of this speech was due as much to the eccentric nature of his arguments against the union as to its eloquence, for he devoted himself to proving that the union was forbidden by scripture, by quoting texts from <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and the <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. He took advantage of the attention he had attracted to publish in the same year his <span class="italic">Concise View of the Great Predictions in the Sacred Writings</span> and nine volumes of his <span class="italic">Universal History</span>, under the title <span class="italic">A Summary of Universal History</span>. With the passing of the union Dobbs sank into obscurity; he could not get any more of his books published, he became encumbered with debts, his eccentricities increased to madness, and he died in great pecuniary difficulties on 11 April 1811.<br>
