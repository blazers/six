<span class="headword">Clare,  Margaret  de</span>, countess of Gloucester  (1291/2?&#150;1342), <span class="occ">noblewoman and heiress</span>, was the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5438/', "Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester and of Hertford (1243&#150;1295)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14821/', "Joan of Acre (1272&#150;1307)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8517/', "Edward I")</script>. She was reportedly twenty-two years old at the time of the death at Bannockburn (1314) of her brother Gilbert. She was married first to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10463/', "Piers Gaveston, earl of Cornwall (d. 1312)")</script>, on 1 November 1307 at Berkhamsted. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8518/', "Edward II")</script> probably arranged this alliance between his favourite and a royal niece, and attended the wedding, adding a personal touch to the proceedings by providing &pound;7 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in pennies, which were thrown over the heads of the bride and groom as they were about to enter the church. Margaret and Gaveston had one daughter, Joan, born in York on 12 January 1312, and Margaret was churched in the Franciscan house in York on 20 February. Joan was raised at the convent of Amesbury along with the king's niece, Eleanor of Hereford, with whom she received a joint allowance of 100 marks per annum. A marriage to John, son of Thomas of Multon, lord of Egremont, was arranged, but never concluded because Joan died of illness on 13 January 1325. Gaveston was executed by his political enemies in June 1312, and in September the king endowed the widowed Margaret de Clare with lands valued at 2000 marks per annum. This arrangement was modified in December 1316, but the new settlement provided her with the same annual revenues.<br>
<br>On 28 April 1317 she married at Windsor; her second husband was another royal favourite, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37134/', "Hugh Audley the younger (c.1291&#150;1347)")</script>. Edward II reconfirmed his earlier grant to Margaret alone to both Margaret and Hugh and the heirs of their bodies with reversion to the king. In September 1318 Audley and Margaret unsuccessfully petitioned the York parliament for possession of the earldom of Cornwall. This claim was released in December 1318 in return for a settlement in which the king once again confirmed their tenure of the properties already assigned and valued at 2000 marks per annum. In the event of Margaret's predeceasing Audley, he was to continue in seisin of lands valued at 1200 marks, with the remainder reverting to the king. Audley and Margaret did less well with regard to the Clare inheritance, the division of which was finalized in 1317. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7554/', "Hugh Despenser the younger (d. 1326)")</script>, the husband of Margaret's eldest sister, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1337), took the lordships of Glamorgan and Tewkesbury, and a number of manors in southern England; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37338/', "Roger Damory (d. 1322)")</script>, third husband of the youngest sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5435/', "Elizabeth de Clare (lady of Clare) (d. 1360)")</script>, took the lordship of Usk, the honour of Clare itself, and a number of Dorset manors and boroughs. Audley therefore received the lordship of Gwynll&#373;g, the castle of Tonbridge and associated manors in Kent, and a few other properties in southern England. The younger Despenser soon forced the exchange of properties to his own advantage with Audley, acquiring the lordship of Gwynll&#373;g, which included the town and castle of Newport. Although Audley was in the opposition to the Despensers in 1322, he was spared following the royal victory at Boroughbridge through Margaret's intercession.<br>
<br>Margaret predeceased her husband, dying on Tuesday 9 April 1342. At the time of her death she still held several manors in Devon and Newport in Essex as dower lands from her marriage to Gaveston. Her heir was her daughter Margaret, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26211/', "Ralph Stafford, first earl of Stafford")</script>, said at the time of her mother's death to be aged, variously, eighteen or twenty years and more. There is no evidence that Amie Gaveston was the daughter of Piers Gaveston and Margaret de Clare, although there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Margaret de Clare did take an interest in the young woman, who may have been her first husband's natural daughter.<br>
