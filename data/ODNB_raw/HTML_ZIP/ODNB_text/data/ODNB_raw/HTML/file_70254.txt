<span class="headword">Detmold,  (Charles) Maurice</span>  (1883&#150;1908), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born in Putney, London, on 21 November 1883, the son of Edward Detmold, electrical engineer, and his wife, Mary Agnes Luck. His mother may have died in childbirth as Maurice and his twin brother, <a name="cosubject_70254"></a><span class="headword">Edward Julius Detmold</span>  (1883&#150;1957), also a <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, were raised as orphans and entrusted into the care of an uncle, Dr E. B. Shuldham, who lived in Hampstead. From the age of five both boys showed an interest in drawing animals in the zoological gardens and in the British Museum (Natural History) in London, and shortly after this time they spent six months drawing at the Hampstead Conservatoire, thereby receiving what is likely to have been their only formal artistic training. They showed a precocious artistic talent, being deeply influenced in their work by both Shuldham's knowledge of natural history and his collection of Japanese prints. In 1897, aged thirteen, the pair exhibited at the Royal Academy, attracting the attention of Edward Burne-Jones who advised them to abandon any future plans for artistic training. They then went on to exhibit at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colour and began to experiment with etching.<br>
<br>Maurice Detmold's first attempt at mezzotint was made in 1898 but he only once returned to this technique of printmaking and henceforth experimented mainly with colour printing. In that year the brothers exhibited at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the English Art Club, and the International Exhibition at Kensington, London. In 1898 they produced a small portfolio, <span class="italic">Eight Proof Etchings by Maurice and Edward Detmold</span>, this edition selling out almost immediately. In 1899 the brothers learned the use of aquatint, which they applied to their work with some success. Also in 1899 a volume of coloured reproductions of the brothers' drawings, <span class="italic">Pictures from Birdland</span>, was published by Dent. In 1900 they held an exhibition of drawings and prints in a variety of techniques at the galleries of the Fine Art Society. They continued to work together, painting large watercolours illustrating an edition of Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Jungle Book</span> which was published in 1903. In 1904 Maurice exhibited at the Royal Academy, and the brothers contributed a joint etching, <span class="italic">The Falcon</span>, to the <span class="italic">Artist Engraver</span>. On 12 January 1905 the brothers were elected associates of the Royal Society of Painter&#150;Etchers and Engravers. Although they later resigned their membership, they contributed some of their best work to that year's exhibition. During August and September of the same year, the Arts and Crafts Exhibition at Leicester included designs for stained glass by both brothers. These designs added to the increasing evidence in Maurice's work that he in particular wished to escape from the label of &#145;animal artist&#146; and move into more imaginative fields of art.<br>
<br>Two plates produced late in 1905 were Maurice Detmold's last etched works. He had produced in total ten etchings and two woodcuts in collaboration with Edward and twenty-five etchings done by himself, though in part from drawings by his brother. Many of the works produced separately by the brothers are almost indistinguishable from each other, but it is the collaboration involved in producing the single-plate etchings that is the most remarkable. &#145;They seemed as one soul divided between two bodies, inspired by the same ideal, using the same means of expression, possessing the same quickness of eye and deftness of hand&#146;  (Dodgson, &#145;Maurice and Edward Detmold&#146;, 373).<br>
<br>For several years the brothers had resided in West Hampstead but had spent periods at Ditchling in Sussex. On 9 April 1908, prior to one of these visits to Sussex, Maurice Detmold committed suicide&#151;at his home in Inglewood Road&#151;by inhaling chloroform. A suicide note found near his side read: &#145;This is not the end of a life. I have expressed through my physical means all that they are capable of expressing, and I am about to lay them aside&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>). He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Although Maurice Detmold was generally considered to be the more talented of the pair, both brothers' later works in particular show a remarkable technical ability which a combination of lack of training and experience did not allow to mature and develop. These works are distinguished by their personal interpretations of the subject matter and are heavily influenced by the works of Japanese masters (notably Hiroshige and Hokusai) while adhering to the conventions of art nouveau. Their animal paintings and illustrations show refined naturalistic features, with plumes and feathers subordinated to decorative arrangement, giving the subject an exaggerated and stylized appearance.<br>
<br>For over a decade after Maurice's death Edward Detmold continued to produce prints and watercolours and was perceived as a notable British printmaker. In the 1930s he retired into virtual obscurity, creating mainly saleable watercolours and prints depicting birds and flowers. Becoming increasingly disillusioned with the world around him, which he referred to as &#145;this blood-drenched civilisation&#146;, he, as did his brother nearly half a century earlier, took his own life, by shooting himself in Montgomery, Wales, in 1957. An exhibition of his work was held at the Keyser Gallery in 1979. Examples of the brothers' work are in the collections of the National Art Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum's department of prints and drawings, London.<br>
