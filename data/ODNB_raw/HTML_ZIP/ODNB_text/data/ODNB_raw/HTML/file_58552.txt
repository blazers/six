<span class="headword">Cramb <span class="st"> [Cram]</span>,  John Adam</span>  (1861&#150;1913), <span class="occ">historian and defence publicist</span>, was born at Denny in Stirlingshire on 4 May 1861, the fourth child and second son of David Cram, who after failing in a photography and lithographic printing business worked as a carpenter, and of his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall. The family moved to Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire, and after leaving school Cram worked in a pattern factory near his home, an unhappy episode he afterwards seldom mentioned. He read and was lastingly influenced by Carlyle. In October 1879 he went to Glasgow University to prepare for the ministry. He studied under Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and others, went as a &#145;supply&#146; preacher to various parishes, and changed the spelling of his name to Cramb. In 1886 he graduated with first-class honours in classics and was appointed Luke fellow in English literature. He studied in Bonn and attended lectures by Treitschke, whose Anglophobia and glorification of war made a lasting impression and led to Cramb's <span class="italic">Germany and England</span> (1914). He acquired a wide knowledge of German history and literature, and continued to be influenced by Treitschke, Nietzsche, and other German writers. Suffering religious doubts, he decided against entering the ministry.<br>
<br>Cramb worked unhappily as a schoolmaster at Melrose, then in 1887 travelled on the continent. On 4 October 1887 he married Lucy 
    (<i>d</i>. 26 Sept 1918, aged seventy-two)
  , third daughter of Edward W. Selby Lowndes, JP and deputy lieutenant, of Winslow House, Winslow, Buckinghamshire; they had one son, Meyrick. From 1887 to 1890 Cramb was lecturer in modern history at Queen Margaret College, Glasgow, a new women's college. In 1890, to advance his career, he moved to London, and from then on lived in the Notting Hill and Kensington area. He wrote for the press, including the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, and contributed ten articles to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. From 1891 he was a modern history examiner for the civil service commissioners. From January 1892, after the committee's Cantabrigian first choice declined the post, Cramb was lecturer in modern history at Queen's College, Harley Street, London: a unique institution, never part of London University but providing university-style education to girls of senior secondary-school age and to adult lady part-time students. From May 1893 he was professor of modern history there. Walrus-moustached, multilingual, erudite, and enthusiastic, he was an ardent, judgemental, and wide-ranging lecturer, without notes. &#145;An arresting and dominating personality &hellip; with much of Thomas Carlyle's turn of phrase&#146;  (<span class="italic">Queen's College Magazine</span>, Dec 1913, 139), he much impressed his students. Katherine Mansfield wrote, &#145;Cramb, wonderful Cramb! &hellip; ageless and fiery &hellip; I couldn't write down Cramb's thunder. I simply wanted to sit and hear him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 104). Another admiring student, Lilian M. Rigby (later Mrs C. E. B. Russell), daughter of Major-General C. P. Rigby (1820&#150;1885), attended Cramb's lectures for ten years and later wrote his biography. He also gave short courses of lectures on history, literature, and philosophy at private houses. However he apparently did no primary research and he never published a work of academic history.<br>
<br>In 1903 Cramb met at the Queen's Hall, London, Lady Ottoline Morrell. In 1904 they had a close relationship, with Cramb apparently romantically besotted with her, but she ended it. He based his novel <span class="italic">Cuthbert Learmont</span> on it. After his death she wrote, &#145;He was as brilliant&#151;&amp; wonderful as anyone I ever met&#146;  (Darroch, 52).<br>
<br>In 1900, responding to the South African War, Cramb published his first book, <span class="italic">The Origins and Destiny of Imperial Britain</span>, originally lectures: fervent imperialist propaganda justifying the South African War, glorifying war and its sacrifice, and warning of the foreign, especially German, threat to Britain and the empire. The book's reception disappointed Cramb, not bringing the hoped-for recognition. In the book he favoured compulsory military training, and he supported the campaign by Lord Roberts and the revived <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95555', "National Service League")</script>. In 1906 he met Roberts, and in 1907 he lectured for the league. In 1910 Ian Hamilton's <span class="italic">Compulsory Service</span> attacked the compulsionist case. Roberts replied with <span class="italic">Fallacies and Facts</span> (1911). Cramb assisted Roberts in writing its first part, and himself wrote its anonymous third part, &#145;The argument from history&#146;: Lady Roberts wrote that the latter &#145;made mincemeat&#146; of Hamilton's historical allusions. In the following years Cramb was Roberts's speech-writer for his &#145;national service&#146; campaign. He was paid by Roberts from his private account. Through his friendship with Roberts and other officers Cramb became an occasional lecturer at the Staff College and military centres.<br>
<br>Cramb devoted much time to writing novels. He published, under the pseudonym J. A. Revermont, three: <span class="italic">Lucius Scarfield</span> (1908), <span class="italic">Cuthbert Learmont</span> (1910), and <span class="italic">The Marrying of Hester Rainsbrook</span> (1913). According to his biographer &#145;none was a popular success &hellip; seeing that the mental effort required in reading them is greater than their entertainment value&#146;  (Russell, 157). Yet D. H. Lawrence considered <span class="italic">Hester Rainsbrook</span> &#145;rather good&#146;. <span class="italic">Sch&ouml;nbrunn</span>, partly autobiographical but largely about Bonaparte, who fascinated Cramb, was published posthumously in 1918.<br>
<br>Himself German-influenced, Cramb in early 1913 delivered at Queen's College a series of lectures warning against German Anglophobia, aggression, and threat to Britain, asserting the &#145;ideal element&#146; in war, and arguing against pacifism. They were published posthumously in June 1914 as <span class="italic">Germany and England</span>, which was extensively reprinted during the war. In the summer of 1913 Cramb's health much deteriorated, and he died of &#145;malignant disease of the duodenum&#146; at his home, 55 Edith Road, West Kensington, on 7 October. His body was cremated at Golders Green, and the urn interred at Ightham churchyard, near Sevenoaks. Cramb contributed to shaping British attitudes before and during the First World War.<br>
