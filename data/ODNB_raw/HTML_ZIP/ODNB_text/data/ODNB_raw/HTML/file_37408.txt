<span class="headword">Fairburn,  Charles Edward</span>  (1887&#150;1945), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born in Bradford on 5 September 1887, the only son of Robert Fairburn and his wife, Elizabeth. He was educated at Bradford grammar school, where he gained an open scholarship in mathematics to Brasenose College, Oxford. Brasenose awarded him a senior Hulme exhibition and he obtained first classes in mathematical moderations (1906), mathematics (1908), and engineering science (1910). For the next two years he was a pupil under Henry Fowler, chief mechanical engineer of the Midland Railway at its Derby works. He studied engineering drawing at Derby Technical College and metallurgy at Sheffield University, gaining his MA in 1912.<br>
<br>Fairburn then joined the railway engineering department of Siemens Dynamo Works Ltd in Stafford and from 1913 to 1916 was assistant to the resident engineer for the electrification of the first freight railway in Britain to be operated by electric traction, the Newport (Middlesbrough) to Shildon line of the former North Eastern Railway. In this he was responsible for the design and installation of the overhead contact system and for putting the locomotives into service. In 1914 he married Eleanor, daughter of Dr Cadman of Bradford. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1916 Fairburn joined the Royal Flying Corps as an officer in an experimental squadron developing new flying formation and fighting techniques, and he attained the rank of major in 1918.<br>
<br>Fairburn joined the English Electric Company Ltd in 1919. He established and developed their engineering department for railway electrification in Britain and overseas. In addition, in 1926 he became general manager of their Preston works and, in 1928, of the Stafford works also. In 1931 he became manager and chief engineer of the traction department, which carried out many important railway electrification schemes, including those of the Southern Railway, New Zealand government railways, Great Indian Peninsula Railway, Danish State Railways, and the Post Office electric railway in London.<br>
<br>In 1934 Fairburn joined the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway (LMS) as chief electrical engineer and in 1937 became deputy chief mechanical engineer and electrical engineer under William Stanier. In 1942 the latter was seconded as scientific adviser to the Ministry of Production and Fairburn became acting chief mechanical engineer, an appointment confirmed in 1944.<br>
<br>Fairburn's wide experience, combined with great technical and organizing abilities, enabled him to achieve improved efficiency in the railway workshops, which became all the more necessary when during the war tank, gun, and aircraft production and repair were added to their activities. From 1934 he was responsible for the introduction on the LMS of substantial numbers of diesel-electric locomotives for heavy-duty service in marshalling yards, where they showed great economies over steam and were the forerunners of more than 1400 of this type on British railways. He also had a keen grasp of steam locomotive matters and was responsible for introducing suburban passenger locomotives in 1945, in which year he also made proposals for the first LMS (and British) main-line diesel-electric locomotives, which were finally introduced under his successor, H. G. Ivatt, two years later. He was an outstanding engineer with quick perception of any issue and great powers of concentration.<br>
<br>Fairburn was an active member of the institutions of Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, and Welding Engineers and a vice-president of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers, to which he gave two important papers on diesel-electric shunting locomotives.<br>
<br>Fairburn died at the London Hospital, Whitechapel, London, on 12 October 1945 following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife.<br>
