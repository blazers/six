<span class="headword">Foxley,  Barbara</span>  (1860&#150;1958), <span class="occ">educationist and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 20 August 1860 at Market Weighton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the second daughter of the Revd Joseph Foxley (1827&#150;1911), vicar of that parish, and his wife, Lucy Allen. She was educated privately at home, then at schools in Manchester and London, before going up to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1879. She took a second class in the historical tripos in 1881, but this was at a time before Cambridge awarded degrees to women. She then gained a teaching certificate and later obtained an MA from Trinity College, Dublin. She did not receive her MA degree from Cambridge until 1949, following the university's decision to open its degrees to women in the previous year.<br>
<br>A small, delicately featured woman, Foxley possessed an incisive intellect and was a talented linguist and an impressive public speaker. She made important contributions to education, women's rights, and public life in south Wales. She held various teaching posts and by the age of twenty-five obtained her first headship at Dewsbury church school but it was her appointment as headmistress of Queen Mary's High School, Walsall, which marked a decisive step in her career. She placed a very high value on the education of girls and in Walsall her work attracted wide attention. Her reputation led to a position in the education department at Manchester University as &#145;mistress of method&#146;, where she produced a translation into English of Jean Jacques Rousseau's seminal text <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span> for the <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> edition (1911). She was appointed to a position at University College, Cardiff, in 1911, where four years later she succeeded Millicent Mackenzie as professor of education: Cardiff at this time had separate education departments for women and men students. Her forceful, but likeable, personality, her organizational ability, and her dedication to her work ensured that her years in Cardiff, where she remained until her retirement in 1925, were extremely successful. As she modestly put it, &#145;The College seemed to like me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>).<br>
<br>Professor Foxley was a dedicated campaigner for women's suffrage and an advocate of women's rights, pressing, in particular, for women to enter public life. She was a member of the executive committee of the very effective Cardiff and District Women's Suffrage Society, where she worked alongside Mary Collin, headmistress of Cardiff High School for Girls. By 1913 the Cardiff Society, which was affiliated to the moderate National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), was the largest society outside London. In 1919, when the NUWSS was renamed the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, following the partial enfranchisement of women in 1918, she was elected to its national executive committee.<br>
<br>Foxley consistently urged women to stand for public office. Politically she was a liberal and in 1924 she stood as official Liberal candidate for the Cathays ward in a by-election to Cardiff city council. She won the seat, polling almost twice the number of votes as the Labour candidate. As a councillor she took particular interest in education, housing, and issues relating to women. In religion she was a Unitarian and was a frequent and eloquent preacher at Cardiff's Unitarian church. In later years she continued to live a very active life, travelling widely. She spent much of her retirement in Cardiff before moving to the spa town of Llandrindod Wells, Radnorshire, for health reasons, where she died at the Spa Nursing Home on 26 August 1958.<br>
