<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Rachel Ethelreda</span>  (1892&#150;1957), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, was born on 17 October 1892 at The Nest, Church Grove, Hampton Wick, the third child and younger daughter of Robert Norman Ronald Ferguson (<i>c</i>.1850&#150;1903), a clerk in the Treasury (and, as his daughter chose repeatedly to mention, the son of the physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria), and his wife, Rose Geraldine Cumberbatch (<i>c</i>.1863&#150;1947). Soon after her birth the family moved to Teddington where they remained until Mr Ferguson's death on Strawberry Hill golf course, after which the two girls were taken by their mother to live for two years in Italy. On their return the Fergusons settled in Kensington, the history and atmosphere of which Rachel Ferguson absorbed and eventually distilled in two inimitable books: <span class="italic">Passionate Kensington</span> (1939) and <span class="italic">The Royal Borough</span> (1950). She attended two small private schools, the first run by Miss Mildred Wetton at 17 Sheffield Gardens and the second, described in its prospectus as &#145;Paris in London&#146; (French was to be spoken at all times), in Wetherby Road, Earls Court. Both appear to have devoted most of their curriculum to drama, an emphasis happily to Rachel Ferguson's taste.<br>
<br>Rachel Ferguson was certainly impressed by the dramatic overtones of the suffrage campaign staged by the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and about 1908 with her sister and mother entered into the fight for the vote, revelling in participation in suffrage spectacle. Ferguson was a founder of the WSPU's young people's society, the Drummers' Union, and then honorary treasurer and chair of a breakaway group, the Young Purple, White, and Green Club, which staged <span class="italic">How Spring Came to Nutt's Alley</span>, a one-act propaganda play which she co-authored. Rachel Ferguson, with her mother, withdrew from involvement with the WSPU after Mrs Pankhurst, whom she characterized as &#145;an idea rather than a friend or mother, a torchbearer, dedicated and&#151;inevitably&#151;fanatical&#146;  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">We were Amused</span>, 109), broke with the Pethick-Lawrences, of whom they were especially fond. In <span class="italic">Victorian Bouquet: Lady X Looks On</span> (1931) Rachel Ferguson allows her doughty heroine to sum up the suffrage campaign as &#145;our Eton and Oxford, our regiment, our ship, our cricket-match&#146;  (p. 21). In her autobiography Rachel Ferguson, essentially conservative, commented, &#145;The trouble about the vote is that it was unlawfully withheld far too long and ultimately bestowed far too lavishly&#146;  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">We were Amused</span>, 112). Her education continued with a secretarial course at Kensington College and a period of instruction at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, which was, as she wrote, &#145;grand copy&#146;  (ibid., 130), although her own stage and film career, while clearly highly enjoyable, lasted only three years, its end more or less coinciding with the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>Rachel Ferguson's novels are redolent of her witty affection for the theatre, particularly for its lighter manifestations. In the 1920s Rachel Ferguson developed a career in journalism, first with the <span class="italic">Sunday Chronicle</span> and then, by 1925, as &#145;Rachel&#146;, a regular columnist in <span class="italic">Punch</span>. Her wit&#151;fey, whimsical, and elliptical&#151;found an outlet in tender parody; many of her <span class="italic">Punch</span> articles were collected in <span class="italic">Nymphs and Satires</span> (1932). <span class="italic">Celebrated Sequels</span> (1934) parodies such popular writers of the day as E. M. Delafield, Beverly Nichols, Rudyard Kipling, H. G. Wells, and Hugh Walpole. In 1923 her first novel, <span class="italic">False Goddesses</span>, which she characterized later as &#145;a story of stage and suburbia&#146;, was described by one critic as &#145;one of the two oddest books he had ever come across&#146;  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">We were Amused</span>, 171). Of another of her novels, <span class="italic">The Bront&euml;s Went to Woolworths</span> (1931), she herself commented, while in the process of writing it, that &#145;It's getting so odd that I'm rather frightened of it&#146;  (ibid., 185). This oddness, curiously unsettling, has given <span class="italic">The Bront&euml;s</span> a lasting reputation; it was reprinted as a <span class="roman">Virago Classic</span> in 1988. Later novels such as <span class="italic">The Stag at Bay</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">Alas Poor Lady</span> (1937), fuelled by mordant social observation, reveal her compassion for impoverished gentlewomen:<blockquote>whose terrible needs every government overlooks, being apparently unable to visualize an empty larder and a coal-less grate as a condition of life suffered by any class above the labouring one. The continuity of this neglect is made possible by the victims themselves, who, inhibited and handicapped by caste, are too proud to beg, too inexperienced to live upon their wits in a competitive age. (Ferguson, <span class="italic">Passionate Kensington</span>, 215&#150;16)</blockquote>Rachel Ferguson's life in Kensington, living happily with her mother, was enlivened by friendship with such other literary denizens as Violet Hunt and Angela Thirkell, the presidency of the Kensington Kitten and Neuter Cat Club, and, in her last years, by involvement in founding the Kensington Society, which aimed to conserve the buildings and atmosphere she had woven into so much of her writing. Rachel Ferguson died at her home, 2 Phillimore Terrace, on 26 November 1957 of cardiac failure and pernicious anaemia. An edition of her memoirs, <span class="italic">We were Amused</span>, appeared posthumously in 1958.<br>
