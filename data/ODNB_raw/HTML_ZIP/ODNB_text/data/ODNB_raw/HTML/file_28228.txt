</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Verney, Sir  Edmund</span>  (1590&#150;1642), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born on 1 January 1590 in Drury Lane, London, the second son of Sir Edmund Verney (1535&#150;1600), knight of Penley, Hertfordshire, and his third wife, Mary Blakeney (<i>d</i>. 1642). Sir Edmund's first well-documented ancestor, Sir Ralph Verney, a mercer, had been appointed lord mayor of London in 1465. Later the Verneys became courtiers through marriage and political alliances and in keeping with this tradition Sir Edmund became knight marshal and standard bearer to Charles I. In preparation for his career he studied briefly at St Alban Hall, Oxford, in 1603&#150;4, visited the French and Italian courts, and toured battlefields in the Low Countries. In 1611 he was knighted and sent to Madrid. He returned &#145;an accomplished gentleman&#146;  (F. Verney, 1.70) and joined his uncle Francis as a member of Prince Henry's household. After Henry's early death, Verney, barely twenty-three, was appointed a gentleman of the privy chamber in young Prince Charles's household&#151;a connection with the future king that engendered deep loyalty and caused later divisions within the Verney family.<br>
<br>On 14 December 1612 Verney married Margaret Denton (1594&#150;1641); they had ten children who survived infancy. He received a &pound;2300 portion and four years' room and board in return for a &pound;400 jointure. The socially prominent Dentons of Hillesden, Buckinghamshire, lived near Middle Claydon, which the Verneys had owned since the 1460s. However, the Claydon estate was leased to a tenant, and Margaret and her children lived at Hillesden while Verney was attending court. His career as a courtier did not produce the expected financial benefits. Never an astute businessman, in 1620 he agreed to pay almost &pound;4000 to secure the surrender of the lease on Middle Claydon, although it had only fifteen years to run. Prince Charles promised to pay &pound;1000 per year for four years, but appears to have made only one &pound;1000 payment, in 1623. Verney regained Claydon but &#145;thereby&#146;, he &#145;became much in depte&#146;  (Bruce, 135).<br>
<br>In 1622 Verney was made lieutenant of Whaddon Chase and in 1623 he followed Prince Charles and Buckingham to Madrid where they were negotiating a Spanish match. There Verney proved himself an ardent protestant by protecting a dying Englishman from a Catholic priest. In addition he helped Prince Charles to extricate himself from the Spanish alliance, by providing him with a jewel paved with ten diamonds which the prince used as a gift. On his return to England he was elected MP for Buckingham borough in 1624. In 1625 he was elected for New Romney, one of the Cinque Ports, on the nomination of the duke of Buckingham, and he sat for Aylesbury in 1629, and for Chipping Wycombe in 1640 in the Short and Long parliaments.<br>
<br>When Charles became king Verney was appointed knight marshal for life with a &pound;200 pension and responsibility to preserve order within 12 miles of the court. He and his deputies were to &#145;continually ride both in the day time and in the night, about our court&#146; arresting anyone without proper credentials  (Bruce, 115). He also had command of the Marshalsea prison and its profits. Throughout the 1630s he rode with the king on long journeys, which aggravated his sciatica and lameness, despite visits to Bath. In 1639 he delivered a message from the king to the Scottish army which led to a peace treaty. His court and political duties, however, required him mainly to be in London. Thus in 1634 he established himself in a great double house in Covent Garden Piazza with an annual rent of &pound;160.<br>
<br>Verney's expenses continued to exceed the income paid to him by Charles I and his attempts to make money from patents, investments, and grants of offices ended in failure. His ventures included patents for hackney coaches and inspecting tobacco, investing in drainage projects in the fens, and buying confiscated Irish estates. He paid &pound;1000 to the court of wards to marry his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28233/', "Ralph Verney (1613&#150;1696)")</script>, to an heiress, and in 1640 he lent the king another &pound;1000. He hoped to provide for his family through a &pound;400 annuity raised from the aulnage, a tax on sealing woollen yarn, but this proved disappointing. With only a life interest in his lands, he left Ralph saddled with debts: his younger sons and his unmarried daughters received only tiny annuities.<br>
<br>Verney's financial problems took place in the context of growing political unrest in parliament and the court. His life illustrates how families became divided during the civil wars and how individuals had to make painful choices between duty to family, religion, and king. &#145;Indeed the world now account[s] it policy&#146;, wrote Verney's daughter Cary, &#145;for the father to be one side and the son on the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 440). Verney's younger sons, Henry, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28229/', "Edmund Verney (1616&#150;1649)")</script>, and Thomas, served in the royalist army, whose standard their father bore, but at the same time, both Sir Edmund and his eldest son were deeply committed protestants, who disliked Laudian practices and desired simplicity in worship. They sat together in parliament and wore their hair long, but they voted in opposition to Charles I's wishes. &#145;The opinion, I see of the great ones most at the court&#146;, wrote Henry to his brother Ralph, &#145;is that my father and you are all for the Parliament and not for the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 440).<br>
<br>Verney admitted his predicament to a royalist friend:<blockquote>I do not like the quarrel, and do heartily wish that the King would yield and consent to what they desire, so that my conscience is only concerned in honour and in gratitude to follow my master. I have eaten his bread, and served him near thirty years, and will not do so base a thing as to forsake him; and choose rather to lose my life&#151;which I am sure to do&#151;to preserve and defend those things which are against my conscience to preserve and defend. (Gardiner, 1.5)</blockquote>In explaining his motives he specified religious issues as the cause of his opposition to the king. &#145;I have no reverence for Bishops&#146;, he stated, &#145;for whom this quarrel subsists&#146;  (ibid., 1.5).<br>
<br>When civil war came Ralph Verney sided with parliament while his father raised the royalist standard at Nottingham in August 1642 and died on 23 October on the battlefield at Edgehill. Later a family story arose of how the standard was found clutched in his severed hand, although the body was never recovered. It was reported that Verney killed two men with his own hands and &#145;would nither put on armes or buff cote the day of battell&#146;  (F. Verney, 2.119), which implied a desire to die. Although these family tales cannot be proved, Sir Edmund was consistently described as a man &#145;of great courage and &hellip; confessedly valiant&#146;  (ibid., 1.72). Contemporaries confirm that his regiment bore the brunt of the action at Edgehill. He stood his ground at the head of the army and died in the service of the king. His sombre face can be seen at Claydon House in portraits by Van Dyck and others.<br>
