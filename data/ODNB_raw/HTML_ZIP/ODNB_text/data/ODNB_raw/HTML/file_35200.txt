<span class="headword">Nelson, Sir  Hugh Muir</span>  (1833&#150;1906), <span class="occ">politician and pastoralist in Australia</span>, was born at Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland, on 31 December 1833, the son of William Lambie Nelson LLD (<i>d</i>. 1887), a Presbyterian minister and sheep farmer, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Muir. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and Edinburgh University, where he did not graduate, but came under the influence of Professor John Wilson, a contributor to the tory <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> under the pseudonym Christopher North. Nelson emigrated to Queensland with his family in 1853, and became a storekeeper's clerk in Ipswich. Later he took farming work and managed sheep stations for his father and others, including Eton Vale from 1862 to 1872. In August 1870 he married Janet, the daughter of Duncan McIntyre, at Toowoomba, and they eventually settled on the 40,000 acre Loudon estate near Dalby, which Nelson acquired with his brother-in-law Watts. They prospered, and sold out for &pound;60,000 just before the financial crash of 1893.<br>
<br>Nelson entered Queensland politics as chairman of the Wambo divisional board in 1880, and was elected to the state legislative assembly for Northern Downs in 1883, having unsuccessfully contested the same electoral district in 1879. Following the boundary reorganization of 1888 he represented the subdivision of Murilla for the remainder of his active political career. He became secretary for railways in June 1888 in the ministry led by his political mentor Sir Thomas McIlwraith, and continued as secretary for railways and public works under the premiership of Boyd Dunlop Morehead until August 1890. He was leader of the opposition throughout 1891. Under the &#145;Griffilwraith&#146; coalition he was briefly vice-president of the executive council and acting colonial treasurer, and he served McIlwraith as treasurer from March 1893 before succeeding him as premier in October 1893. He combined this office with those of vice-president of the executive council and colonial president (until August 1896), chief secretary (from March 1895), and treasurer (August 1896 to March 1898).<br>
<br>Nelson's premiership came at a time of economic and social upheaval, to which he reacted with political caution and budgetary austerity. Twice, in May 1893 and in February 1896, he intervened to save the Queensland National Bank, by which means he rendered &#145;his greatest and shrewdest service to colonial capital and bourgeois society&#146;  (<span class="italic">AusDB</span>). The <span class="roman">Peace Preservation Act</span>, which he originated during the failed shearers' strike of 1894, became a cornerstone of the future conduct of industrial relations. Nelson won contemporary repute as a constitutional authority, and opposed the federation of the Australian states.<br>
<br>Nelson was created KCMG in 1896, and represented Queensland at the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897; while in England he was sworn of the privy council and received honorary degrees from Oxford and Edinburgh. He resigned the premiership on 13 April 1898 and his seat in the assembly soon afterwards. From 29 July 1898 he served as president of the legislative council, and from 1904 to 1905 was lieutenant-governor of Queensland. He founded the Royal Agricultural Society of Toowoomba and the Austral Association and was president of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (Queensland), the Colonial Political Association, and the Queensland Club. He took an interest in New Guinea, to which he made several visits.<br>
<br>Nelson died at his residence, at Gabbinbar, Middle Ridge, Toowoomba, on 1 January 1906, and was buried in Toowoomba cemetery after a state funeral under Presbyterian rites. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and three daughters. A physically imposing man, Nelson was a ruthless and effective politician, who could none the less be both humorous and reflective in private.<br>
