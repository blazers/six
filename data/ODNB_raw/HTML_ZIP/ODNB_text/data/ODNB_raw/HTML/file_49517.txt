<span class="headword">Emery,  Josiah</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1725, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">watchmaker</span>, was baptized on 11 November 1725 at Etagni&egrave;res, north-west of Lausanne in the pays de Vaud, Switzerland, the son of Jacques and Suzanne-Marie Gammeter-Emery, one of nine children (three boys and six girls). He was probably trained in Geneva and by the time he was in his thirties he had emigrated to London; on 22 April 1762 he was appointed one of the elders of the consistory of the new Swiss church in Endell Street, London (led by watchmaker Justin Vulliamy) and he remained active in that church for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1762 Emery married, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Charing Cross, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1769), daughter of John Jacob and his wife, Ann, a member of the great Courtauld family of goldsmiths (and later textile manufacturers). They had four daughters. In February 1769 Ann died and on 24 January 1771 Emery married the 25-year-old Susannah Smith at St George's, Hanover Square. There were four daughters and two sons from this marriage, including John Claudius, who also became a watchmaker.<br>
<br>Emery's home and business was at 2 Cockspur Street (his trade card described it as opposite Hedge Lane), Charing Cross, and in the course of his career he gained a reputation as one of the top makers in London (and thus worldwide), supplying the nobility and, at least on one occasion, the king. The great French chronometer maker Louis Berthoud wrote that Emery's work contained:<blockquote>a profound understanding of the causes of regularity and irregularity in watches; a highly finished execution in the essential parts; nothing luxurious that is extraneous to the main objective; but every care that absolute precision demands&#151;all this, I think, we find in the products of Emery, which should make them precious to those well informed people who own them. (Clutton, 399)</blockquote>Ostensibly a watchmaker&#151;his total production during the course of his career was about 1400 watches&#151;Emery did also sell clocks and regulators, and one turret clock is known, dated 1787 and signed by him although made to order by Thwaites of Clerkenwell. In 1772 he made a precision timekeeper, no. 615 (now preserved in the Mus&eacute;e des Arts et M&eacute;tiers in Paris) which had similarities to John Harrison's mould-breaking &#145;H4&#146; and was clearly influenced by it. In 1788 an Emery watch answering this exact description (almost certainly the same watch) was tested by Count F. S. van Bylandt in longitude experiments. In the mid-1770s Emery was asked by Count von Br&uuml;hl, ambassador to Britain for the court of Saxony and a close friend and champion of the great watchmaker Thomas Mudge, to make parts of the temperature compensation mechanism for Mudge's timekeepers &#145;Green&#146; and &#145;Blue&#146; and in these very special parts Emery incorporated a new alloy of his own invention.<br>
<br>Emery was one of a large group of watchmakers, all working outside the city boundaries, who met as an informal professional group at the Devil tavern. On 15 September 1780, they met to discuss the increasing problem of cheap, foreign imports (somewhat ironically, as a number of them were, like Emery, first generation immigrants themselves) and to organize a petition to the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers. In their petition they offered to join the company and pay quarterage if the company would take positive steps to curb illegal imports of clocks and watches to London. Fifty-four makers signed the original petition, and, in 1781, many, including Emery, were made honorary freemen of the company. Some then continued paying quarterage and formally took part in the company, but Emery appears to have lost interest immediately and failed to pay any quarterage thereafter.<br>
<br>Since the mid-1770s Count von Br&uuml;hl had been trying to persuade Emery to make copies of Thomas Mudge's precision watch, with Mudge's new lever escapement, made for George III and given to Queen Charlotte (1769); Mudge himself had begun work on his marine timekeepers (those of 1774 and 1777) of a different construction and had no time to develop this very important element of watchwork. For several years Emery resisted von Br&uuml;hl's proposals, saying Mudge was the best person to make his own designs, besides which, he complained, they were very difficult to construct on a small scale (watch no. 661 made by Emery <i>c</i>.1775 with an early, crude lever escapement is extant and suggests Emery secretly tried out the ideas von Br&uuml;hl had described to him). However, in 1780 he finally agreed to make some copies and was given by von Br&uuml;hl a large model made by Mudge of his escapement. The series of watches which resulted were the first to incorporate Mudge's lever escapement, and they proved to be of immense historical significance; Mudge's escapement was to be the central feature of the majority of all watches made up to the introduction of quartz technology in the early 1970s. Emery did not really know Mudge (he said that in his life he only ever spoke three words to him) and did not see Mudge's original watch until some years later, during an audience he had with the king. Therefore he applied this escapement to a watch of his own design, using a number of his own features and incorporating the &#145;Double S&#146; compensation balance patented by John Arnold in 1782, presumably with Arnold's permission. It was the combination of Mudge's escapement with Arnold's balance which was the secret of the design's success and Emery can take the credit for this. About thirty-five of these watches were signed and sold by him, costing between 100 and 150 guineas. They were thus very expensive and were chiefly bought by the nobility and the scientifically minded. (No doubt their high quality explains the relatively high survival rate; at least twenty-two are extant.) According to Thomas Mudge junior, the majority were constructed for Emery by Richard Pendleton of Pentonville, but this probably refers to the escapements of the watches only. In 1792, the Spanish watchmaker Cayetano Sanchez was sent by the Spanish government to Emery for training (Sanchez having previously spent three years with Ferdinand Berthoud in Paris). Within a year his training was complete and Emery was given &pound;200 for his trouble, along with an undertaking that Sanchez would not set up a manufactory in France. Nevertheless, Emery's lever watches were soon imported into France and makers such as Robert Robin and Abraham Louis Breguet in Paris began to make watches based on their design. In the same year, when Thomas Mudge junior was petitioning the board of longitude and parliament for reward for his father's achievements, Emery was one of a number of specialists who gave evidence at the parliamentary select committee. In contrast to some of the answers given by others, his replies to the questions of the board were both modest and very fair.<br>
<br>About 1785 Emery decided to compete for reward from the board of longitude by designing a new marine timekeeper. By March 1791 two such timekeepers were ready and, after a trial with von Br&uuml;hl and George Gilpin, the board agreed to have them tried at Greenwich. The trial lasted from 8 July 1793 to 27 February 1794 but the timekeepers unfortunately did not excel. (One of them, marked &#145;no. 1&#146;, is now preserved in the collection of the Clockmakers' Company at the Guildhall in London.) On 7 June 1794, Emery asked the board to try two more of his timekeepers at Greenwich, to which it consented; these promised a much better performance. (Of these, the &#145;no. 4&#146; is now preserved in the collection of the Mariners' Museum, Newport News, Virginia.) However, on 2 July 1794 Emery suddenly fell ill and, on his deathbed in Chelsea (probably at the house of his friend Francis David Pittonet), wrote his will (in French), leaving everything to his wife, Susannah, save &pound;10 to his &#145;eldest daughter&#146;, Elizabeth. Emery died later the same day. A notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> gives the cause as &#145;a mortification in his bowels&#146; (probably bowel cancer) and remarks &#145;a man much respected&#146;. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 7 July and the will was proved on 16 July.<br>
<br>Emery's brother Salomon, who had been employed by him and who lived at Cockspur Street, appears to have continued the business as an employee of Josiah's widow, but he too died less than a year later. From his will we learn that he and Josiah had shares in the family's Swiss estate which had recently been sold. In 1795 Susannah Emery sold the Cockspur Street business to Louis Recordon and William Dupont. On 1 May 1796 she petitioned the board of longitude for financial reward for her husband's efforts in making timekeepers, complaining that she had incurred heavy losses in &#145;extricating herself from the business&#146; and &#145;with a family of six children&#146; was now &#145;in very limited circumstances&#146;  (CUL, Board of Longitude MSS, RGO 14/11, 171), but the board was unable to help.<br>
