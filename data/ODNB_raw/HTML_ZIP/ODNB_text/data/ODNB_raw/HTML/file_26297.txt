<span class="headword">Staples,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1490, <em>d.</em> after 1558), <span class="occ">bishop of Meath</span>, was born in Lincolnshire. Little is known of his family background, but he incepted MA at Cambridge in 1514 and supplicated for the degrees of BTh and DTh at Oxford in 1526; he became a canon of Wolsey's Cardinal College, Oxford, in 1525. It was his appointment as chaplain to Henry VIII, however, that plucked Staples from obscurity and paved the way for further advancement. He was presented to the prebend of Wigginton in the collegiate church of Tamworth, Staffordshire, on 7 March 1528, but resigned the position in favour of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, which he held <i>in commendam</i> until July 1532. At the king's instigation, Clement VII concurrently provided Staples to the bishopric of Meath on 3 September 1529.<br>
<br>The bishop of Meath had traditionally occupied one of the most influential spiritual and temporal positions in Ireland. Staples, an outsider, who owed his position directly to the king, acquiesced in Henry's bid for ecclesiastical royal supremacy, but incurred the suspicion and enmity of the resident Geraldine interest. Thus, when in 1534 Thomas Fitzgerald, tenth earl of Kildare, rebelled against the crown, Henry was proclaimed a heretic, and John Allen, archbishop of Dublin (and Staples's former colleague at Oxford) was murdered, the bishop of Meath wisely abandoned his see for the safety of England. He returned the following year to a political landscape greatly altered by the destruction of the Geraldines and, presumably, more conducive for reform. Henry entrusted the promotion of his ecclesiastical supremacy to Staples and the newly appointed archbishop of Dublin, George Browne. Yet both men encountered political, cultural, and linguistic challenges in Ireland that compounded the difficulty of their task.<br>
<br>Their initial failure was met with sharp reproach from Henry who, on 31 July 1537, censured Staples for his slackness and negligence in carrying out his ecclesiastical responsibilities. Staples and Browne, moreover, differed in their approach to the Reformation's introduction into Ireland and quarrelled openly over methodology and influence in the first half of 1538. Browne's religious views were more progressive and he concentrated his efforts on achieving, at the very least, outward conformity within the Englishry. Staples, however, was more conservative on religious matters and emphasized the value of education in winning the internal and lasting support of the Irish for the reformed faith. In June 1538 Staples noted that &#145;the common voice in the Irishry is that the King's supremacy is maintained only by power, and not reasoned by learning&#146;, and recommended &#145;to have our master recognized King of Ireland the lack whereof doth much hinder &hellip; duties to be done&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 1, no. 123). This recommendation became a reality in 1541 and underpinned Lord Deputy Sir Anthony St Leger's conciliatory strategy for the Gaelic polity's incorporation into the Tudor state. Yet in the short term, the feud with Browne continued; only the collective intervention of Sir Thomas Cromwell and the Irish privy council defused the quarrel. Ultimately, however, it was the king's support for St Leger's conciliatory administration that ensured the victory of Staples's persuasive strategy for the remainder of the reign.<br>
<br>Staples's religious views evolved apace with events and attitudes in England and in the years following Edward VI's accession he married and preached increasingly vitriolic sermons against the mass. However, his congregation remained staunchly conservative and in December 1548 he pointed to the hatred he had evoked among them by preaching and adhering to the reformed faith. The Edwardian government, however, valued Staples's efforts and the king's continued rule ensured the security of both his position and his influence. Thus with Mary I's accession in 1553 and the restoration of Catholicism, Staples was placed in a compromising position. Though he outwardly supported Mary, his marriage and reputation as a zealous supporter of the reformed faith cost him his bishopric: he was deprived on 29 June 1554. William Walsh succeeded Staples as bishop of Meath in November. Devoid of any political or familial support in England, Staples remained in Ireland, a pariah in his former diocese. His last throw came on 16 December 1558, when he appealed in desperation to Sir William Cecil, principal secretary, for restoration to his former see, claiming that he had been, &#145;dreven almost to begying, thrust owte of my howse, cast from estymacon, and made a gesteing stocke amongst munkes and freers&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/1/8). The Elizabethan regime, however, did not restore the ageing and sickly Staples to the influential bishopric and he died soon after in anonymity. Staples's emphasis on winning support for the royal supremacy without resorting to coercion formed an integral dimension of St Leger's administration in the final years of Henry's reign, but the drastic political and religious change that characterized the mid-Tudor period made the continued implementation of this strategy impossible and ultimately destroyed the foundation upon which Staples had built his career.<br>
