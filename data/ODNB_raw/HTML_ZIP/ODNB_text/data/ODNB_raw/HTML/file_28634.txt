<span class="headword">Walter,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1412?), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, probably came from south-west England. It has often been claimed that he was educated at Winchester College. This cannot be strictly true, since he was at Oxford well before 1383, that is, before the school's foundation (1387), but it is possible that he was at the school it superseded. Walter's name first occurs in Oxford records in connection with his renting a school from Exeter College in 1383 and 1384, by which time he was master of arts. By 1386 he was a fellow of Winchester's sister foundation in Oxford, the newly founded college of St Mary (commonly known as New College, founded in 1379). Ordained successively subdeacon (1387) and deacon (1388), he was made subwarden of the college in 1389, finally vacating his fellowship in 1393. He became rector of Shere in Surrey in 1390, a position he had vacated by May 1407.<br>
<br>Two surviving astronomical works are ascribed to Walter, both of them chiefly concerned with a single narrow problem, that of casting the houses for an astrological figure (that is, calculating a horoscope). The first, apart from some standard astrological and astronomical material drawn largely from elsewhere, is a table of houses of a straightforward kind, prepared for the latitude of Oxford and provided with canons explaining its use. The canons in one manuscript  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud misc. 674) that has strong associations with William Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1482) end with a statement associating Walter with Winchester and New College and saying that they were copied by William Worcester in 1438. While there was much work in calculating the original tables&#151;much more than in the simple canons for their use&#151;they were done according to a standard method and could have drawn on earlier Oxford work.<br>
<br>The second work ascribed to Walter is of a higher level of mathematical originality, although in certain respects somewhat muddled. The disadvantage of standard tables of astrological houses was that they held good only for a particular geographical latitude. The astronomer calculating them made use of tables of ascensional differences, likewise generally done for one latitude; but the Oxford astronomer John Maudith earlier in the century had made use of Toledan tables of the latter type that applied to any latitude. It seems likely that some English astronomer of the fourteenth, or possibly early fifteenth, century, familiar with this work, was trying to make use of the same idea when he drafted the universally applicable tables for the houses in what is now Cambridge University Library, MS Ee.3.61. Lewis Caerleon (<i>d</i>. in or after 1495) makes it clear in this, his own copy of the work, that he is sceptical about John Walter's authorship and about the exactness of the method. The work is certainly ascribed to Walter in an earlier copy  (in Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D.238), but he can at best have been responsible for only a part of it.<br>
<br>John Walter's name is often mentioned in later astrological writing, simply because he was the author of tables of the astrological houses which were much in demand as they could lighten the burden of calculation. He seems not to have been responsible for anything more profound. In his lifetime he presented a book to New College, an exposition of the <span class="roman">Apocalypse</span>. It is not known when he died. John Leland provides information that might not have been as purely speculative as some of his other comments: he claims that Walter returned to Winchester and died and was buried there in 1412.<br>
