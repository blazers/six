<span class="headword">Holden <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Smith]</span>,  Edith Blackwell</span>  (1871&#150;1920), <span class="occ">artist and illustrator</span>, was born on 26 September 1871 at Holly Green, Church Road, Moseley, Birmingham, the fourth of seven children of Arthur Holden (1836&#150;1913), a paint and varnish manufacturer, and his wife, Emma Wearing (1836&#150;1904), formerly a governess. She was brought up a Unitarian. The family believed they had psychic powers and participated in s&eacute;ances where Edith was encouraged to demonstrate her powers of automatic writing. She received no formal elementary education but was taught by her mother. From 1884 to 1890 Edith studied part-time at the Birmingham Municipal School of Art. In 1891 she spent a year studying animal painting at an art school run by Joseph Denovan Adam at Craigmill, Stirling, and returned for a six-week painting holiday most summers for the next sixteen years.<br>
<br>In 1890 Edith exhibited her first painting at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and continued to exhibit there annually until 1907. She also exhibited at the Royal Academy (1907 and 1917), the Walker Gallery in Liverpool, and the Society of Women Artists. The subjects of these oil paintings were usually animals in a landscape frequently inspired by Scotland. From 1906 to 1910 she taught art one afternoon a week at a private girls' school in Solihull, Warwickshire. In 1906 she encouraged the girls to paint wild flowers in their sketchbooks and select suitable verses to write alongside. Privately she compiled her own notebook, which she called &#145;Nature notes for 1906&#146;. This was not her first venture; a similar, less developed version for 1905 was discovered in 1988. In &#145;Nature notes for 1906&#146; she recorded the countryside around the family's new home at Gowan Bank, Kineton Green Road, Olton, Warwickshire. On completion she kept the nature diaries as useful source material for her developing career as a book illustrator. Between 1907 and 1910 Edith's concern about the treatment of animals led her to contribute about forty illustrations to the <span class="italic">Animals' Friend</span>, the magazine of the National Council for Animal Welfare. Some of these illustrations were also sold as calendars and postcards by the charity. Between 1907 and 1914 she illustrated at least seven children's books, such as M. M. Rankin's <span class="italic">Woodland Whisperings</span> (1911), and <span class="italic">Animals Around Us</span> (1912), by Martin Merrythought (A. J. Maas).<br>
<br>On 1 June 1911 Edith married the sculptor (Alfred) Ernest Smith (1879&#150;1938) by special licence at Chelsea register office. The couple lived in a small attic flat at 2 Oakley Crescent, Chelsea. Ernest was principal assistant to the sculptor Lady Feodora Gleichen at her studio at St James's Palace. Edith's marriage did not meet with her family's approval and relations with them deteriorated. Little is known about her marriage and there were no children. On 15 March 1920 Edith drowned in a tributary of the River Thames at Kew Gardens Walk, London, and her body was not discovered until the following day. An inquest at Richmond coroner's court heard that she had probably lost her balance while collecting chestnut buds to paint from a tree at the water's edge. The coroner recorded the verdict &#145;found drowned&#146;. On 19 March 1920 Edith Holden Smith was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
<br>When Edith Holden's personal &#145;Nature notes for 1906&#146; was published by Webb and Bower in association with Michael Joseph as <span class="italic">The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady</span> in June 1977, it was an instant and exceptional best-seller. Translations of the book appeared in thirteen languages, making Edith's nature diary one of the great international publishing success stories of the twentieth century. The book was also influential in creating a fashion for rural nostalgia when merchandise appeared bearing designs from the book, a nostalgia unimpeded by the fact that its author was by background a suburban socialist, and not the leisured country-dweller conjured up by its title.<br>
