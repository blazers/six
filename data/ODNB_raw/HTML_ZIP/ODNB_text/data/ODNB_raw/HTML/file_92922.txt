<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gordon,  Giles Alexander Esm&eacute;</span>  (1940&#150;2003), <span class="occ">literary agent and writer</span>, was born on 23 May 1940 at 11 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh, the eldest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of Alexander Esm&eacute; Gordon (1910&#150;1993), architect, and his wife, Betsy Balmont, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCurry (1910&#150;1990), a pianist. At the time of his birth his parents were living at 2 Darnaway Street, Edinburgh. His background was that of the provincial upper middle class. His father was the senior partner in a large firm of Edinburgh architects and Gordon was educated at Edinburgh Academy, one of the city's leading schools. It was not a happy experience. &#145;Weedy and priggish&#146;  (Gordon, <span class="italic">Aren't We Due a Royalty Statement?</span>, 5), he was picked on by masters and boys alike and vowed never to expose his own children to the sort of treatment he received there. But his undistinguished school career may well have quickened his appetite for worldly success, in which he gloried. &#145;I never see the point of modesty&#146;  (ibid., 133), he later wrote, an issue on which he differed from his father, who deprecated the excessive length of his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry.<br>
<br>After two terms studying book design and typography at the Edinburgh School of Art, Gordon joined the Edinburgh publishers Oliver and Boyd as a trainee. Frustrated by the parochialism of Scottish publishing, he set his sights on London and in 1963 became the advertising manager of Secker and Warburg. In 1964&#151;the year of his marriage to Margaret Anna Eastoe (<i>d</i>. 1989), illustrator; they had a daughter and three sons, one of whom died hours after he was born&#151;he joined Hutchinson, working as an editor on their <span class="roman">New Authors</span> imprint. One of his discoveries was Barry Unsworth, a future Booker prize winner, with whom he would remain associated for forty years. He then spent a year at Penguin, launching their <span class="roman">Modern Playwrights</span> series, and in 1967 became editorial director of Victor Gollancz, the job that made his name. Gordon breathed new life into Gollancz, long regarded as a spent force. In the words of his colleague Liz Calder, later to found Bloomsbury Publishing, &#145;he was an innovator, a rebel and a source of enormous fun&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, 21 Nov 2003). But he was not amused by the exploitation, as he saw it, of writers by miserly publishers. He resolved to become a literary agent, believing that only with the help of an agent could writers secure a square deal. In 1973 he joined Anthony Sheil Associates (later Sheil Land) and soon became known for his belligerent approach.<br>
<br>One reason why Gordon was so determined to fight the writer's corner was that he wrote himself. His six novels, written in the 1970s, were too experimental to catch on and he was called &#145;the enemy of a good read&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 30 July 1993). But it was Gordon who, on the strength of a dog-eared radio script, persuaded the hitherto unknown Sue Townsend to write <span class="italic">The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13&frac34;</span> (1982), which together with its successor, <span class="italic">The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole</span> (1984), sold more copies during the 1980s than any two books by anyone else. However it was the huge advances he obtained for his clients that brought Gordon to public notice, beginning with the &pound;650,000 paid to Peter Ackroyd in 1989 for his biographies of Dickens and Blake. Though both books made a profit, Gordon was blamed by some for rigging the market in favour of big name authors at the expense of their less marketable brethren. His defence was that agencies existed to get the best possible deals for their clients, otherwise they would go out of business. The test of a literary agent, he wrote, was the quality of the writers he or she represented. By this reckoning Gordon was in the front rank. In addition to Unsworth, Ackroyd, and Townsend, he represented Fay Weldon, who called him &#145;the soldier ally at the writer's gate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, 21 Nov 2003), Vikram Seth, and John Fowles, to say nothing of the duke of Edinburgh and the prince of Wales, whose question &#145;Aren't we due a royalty statement?&#146; gave Gordon the title for the jocular, if somewhat breathless, memoir he published in 1993.<br>
<br>Knowledgeable and opinionated about all aspects of the book trade, Gordon served on the literature panel of the Arts Council, the council of the Royal Society of Literature, and the management committee of the Society of Authors. He also found time to edit several volumes of short stories, lecture about writing to American students in London, and write about theatre for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and about books for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. An avid gossip, he was also the clandestine mainstay of <span class="italic">Private Eye's</span> scurrilous &#145;Bookworm&#146; column.<br>
<br>In 1995, after an acrimonious dispute with Sheil Land, Gordon joined Curtis Brown, Britain's oldest literary agency, bringing with him the cream of his old clients. In 1998, to the surprise of many, he moved back to Edinburgh, opening a branch of Curtis Brown there. He explained the move by saying that he and his second wife, Margaret Anne (Maggie) McKernan (<i>b</i>. 1957), a publisher (and daughter of Francis McKernan, production manager), whom he had married on 5 May 1990, were determined that their three young children (two daughters and a son) should be educated at local Scottish schools. Gordon's first marriage had been blighted by tragedy. As well as the son who died shortly after birth, another committed suicide aged twenty-four. Margaret Eastoe herself died in 1989 of a rare incurable disease shortly before her divorce from Gordon was finalized.<br>
<br>Of medium height, bespectacled, with thick auburn hair and plenty of attack, Gordon was a familiar figure wherever two or three members of the London literary set were gathered together for lunch. Too outspoken, particularly when flown with wine, to be universally popular, he commanded the loyalty and affection of those who fell under his spell. Recalling the effect he had on his friends, a colleague echoed Sir Kenneth Clark's verdict on Duveen, the art dealer: &#145;When he was present everyone behaved as if they'd had a couple of drinks&#146;  (private knowledge). He died at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, on 14 November 2003 of a brain injury, following a fall at his house. He was survived by his second wife, their three children, and by a son and daughter from his first marriage. He was buried at Warriston following a funeral service in St Giles's Cathedral on 21 November. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 17 March 2004.<br>
