<span class="headword">Lockey,  Rowland</span>  (<em>c.</em>1566&#150;1616), <span class="occ">painter and goldsmith</span>, was born in London, the son of Leonard Lockey (<i>d</i>. 1613), a crossbow maker and a freeman of the Company of Armourers who lived in Fleet Lane in the parish of St Bride, London. He was apprenticed to Nicholas Hilliard of the Goldsmiths' Company for eight years in 1581, so he was a freeman probably by 1589 and certainly before 1600, when his younger brother Nicholas began an eight-year apprenticeship with him. Rowland Lockey is commended by Richard Haydocke in the preface to <span class="italic">A Tracte Containing the Artes of Curious Paintinge, Carvinge &amp; Buildinge</span> (1598), his translation from the original by Giovanni Lomazzo, &#145;for oil and limning in some measure&#146;  (Kurz, 14); he is also mentioned by Francis Meres, in his <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598), among the eminent artists then living in England, and in Edward Norgate's <span class="italic">Miniatura</span>, in a list of artists who were competent in the use of crayons, or &#145;dry colours&#146;.<br>
<br>Lockey married Martha Juxe of St Bride's at the parish church on 2 February 1602; her father was Thomas Juxe (or Juckes), a freeman of the Grocers' Company practising as an apothecary. Lockey and his wife baptized four children between 1602 and 1608, from the records of which it is known that they were living in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields in 1605 and in St Dunstan-in-the-West by 1608.<br>
<br>Lockey is recognized for his group portraits based on the painting <span class="italic">The Family of Sir Thomas More</span> by Hans Holbein the younger made during his first visit to England in 1526&#150;8 (destroyed; drawing, &Ouml;ffentliche Kunstsammlung Basel Kunstmuseum, Kupferstichkabinett); Lockey's painting in oils (1592), at Nostell Priory, Yorkshire, is a close copy. William Burton (1575&#150;1645), the antiquary, wrote that at Lockey's house he:<blockquote>once saw a neat piece in oil, containing in one table the picture of Sir John More &hellip; and of his wife; and of Sir Thomas More, lord chancellor, his son, and his wife; and of all the lineal heirs male descended from them; together with each man's wife until that present year living. (Kurz, 15)</blockquote>Although the women are wrongly identified this description corresponds very nearly to the painting (1593) at the National Portrait Gallery, London. It differs from Holbein's original by omitting members of the household who were not blood relatives (except Anne Cresacre, mother of the younger Thomas More) and including the descendants to emphasize their dynastic connection to the Elizabethan Mores and their continued adherence to Catholicism. A miniature of 1593&#150;4 (V&amp;A) shows a garden view not in the two paintings.<br>
<br>In 1592 Hilliard and Lockey were paid for pictures for Elizabeth, countess of Shrewsbury. After her death her son William Cavendish, first earl of Devonshire, employed Lockey from 1608 to 1613 to paint more than thirty pictures, the majority of them copies, for Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire. These may have included Bess of Hardwick; Mary, queen of Scots; and James I (Hardwick Hall). The signed portrait of Lady Margaret Beaufort (<i>c</i>.1598) at St John's College, Cambridge, is also a copy by Lockey of an earlier work. A number of miniatures in Hilliard's style have been attributed to Lockey, and he may have designed the title page of the <span class="roman">Bishops' Bible</span> (1602).<br>
<br>John Langton became Lockey's apprentice in 1607 (freeman, 1616) and Raphe Blackmore in 1612; Lockey's stepbrother James Howson (<i>d</i>. 1616) was named as an apprentice in his will. In February 1614 Lockey was taken into the livery of the Goldsmiths' Company. He spent his later years in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West and was among those who contributed to repairing and redecorating the church in 1615. He died within the parish in March 1616 and was buried in his old parish, St Bride's, on 26 March.<br>
<br>In his will dated 15 February 1616 Lockey bequeathed everything but specified legacies to his wife, Martha. He left 20<i>s</i>., to &#145;make him a Ringe&#146;, to John Davies of Hereford, who wrote a poem in his praise  (epigram 258 in <span class="italic">The Scourge of Folly</span>, 1611); Lockey painted his portrait, now lost but possibly that engraved for Davies's <span class="italic">The Writing Schoolemaster</span> (1636).<br>
<br>He left his brother Nicholas &#145;all my Italian Printes and all my plasters&#146; and the lease of the family home in Fleet Lane. In a lawsuit of 1617 Nicholas describes himself as a citizen and armourer of London but &#145;useinge and professinge for his livinge &hellip; the Arte and skill of lymeinge and drawinge of pictures&#146;  (Edmond, 97). A portrait (1620) of John King, bishop of London, attributed to Nicholas Lockey was engraved by Francis Delaram; there are at least eight known paintings of this type. He was still active in 1624.<br>
