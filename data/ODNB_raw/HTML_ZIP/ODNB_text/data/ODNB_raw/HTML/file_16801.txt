<span class="headword">Livingstone <span class="st"> [Livingston]</span>,  Alexander</span>, first earl of Linlithgow  (<em>d.</em> 1621), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16811/', "William Livingston, sixth Lord Livingston (d. 1592)")</script>, and Agnes Fleming (<i>fl</i>. 1553&#150;1584), daughter of the third Lord Fleming, who had married about 1553. As master of Livingstone he fought with the queen's party during the civil wars of 1567&#150;73, and was captured at the taking of Dumbarton Castle on 2 April 1571. With his father he submitted to the regents, but was not in favour until the end of the earl of Morton's regency in 1578. He accompanied the young James VI on his progress from Stirling to make his entry to Edinburgh in September&#150;October 1579. The establishment of a more formal court followed, and on 15 October 1580 Livingstone became one of the gentlemen of the chamber. He was on the assize which on 1 June 1581 found Morton guilty of the murder of Darnley.<br>
<br>After the seizure of the king by the Ruthven raid of 23 August 1582, Livingstone mustered forces to oppose the raiders. On the latter's success he retreated to Glasgow with the fallen royal favourite the duke of Lennox. He eventually accompanied Lennox to France (in December), and remained with him until his death on 26 May 1583. Having returned to Scotland, he was sent back to France after the fall of the Ruthven regime in 1583 to bring Lennox's son to Scotland.<br>
<br>By contract dated 26 and 31 January 1584 Livingstone married Lady Eleanor Hay (<i>d</i>. 1627) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46909/', "Livingstone, Helen")</script>], daughter of Andrew Hay, fifth earl of Erroll. In April that year he played a leading part in suppressing the Stirling raid in which the earl of Mar and other former Ruthven raiders attempted to recover power. When the raiders fled, he and his followers took possession of Stirling Castle. In August he temporarily gained the abbey of Cambuskenneth from Adam Erskine, a Ruthven raider. However, when Mar and his pro-English faction regained power in a successful coup of 2 November 1585, Livingstone was one of those captured at Stirling. Thereafter he was temporarily in eclipse. In the turbulent early 1590s he took a generally conservative stance, but was mentioned as an associate of the fugitive earl of Bothwell in 1592. He succeeded his father as seventh Lord Livingstone about November 1592, and gained in political prominence. He was a privy councillor from May 1593 onwards. He attended council meetings only irregularly, but he did assiduously attend the frequent conventions of the nobility held in this period. He carried the towel at the baptism of Prince Henry on 23 August 1594. In 1595 he incurred the wrath of the earl of Mar when a Livingstone killed one of Mar's followers. The feud rumbled on until 1599, but the king prevented further bloodshed.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1596 Livingstone received a notable mark of royal trust, being appointed keeper of the infant Princess Elizabeth. This angered many leading ministers because, though he himself was at least nominally a protestant, his wife was a committed Catholic, regularly in trouble with the church. Nevertheless, Livingstone retained the princess and also gained custody of her short-lived sister Margaret (1598&#150;1600). Unlike Mar, keeper of Prince Henry, he was on good terms with Queen Anne, whom he escorted to England with her daughter in 1603. He was created earl of Linlithgow on 25 December 1600, at the baptism of Prince Charles. It had been rumoured in November that he would refuse the honour. In a &#145;Catalogue&#146; of the nobility of about 1602 he was &#145;estemit to be Catholique, no actor, but a peaceable nobill man, and wealthy&#146;  (Rogers, 78).<br>
<br>Linlithgow's direct connection with the court lapsed with the union of the crowns in 1603. He was one of the Scottish commissioners for union with England in 1604. Having been appointed in July, the commission met at court between October and December, and Linlithgow served on a subcommittee to discuss customs rates. However, he made no attempt to build a court career in England. He remained an irregular privy councillor, and served on some minor parliamentary commissions.<br>
<br>As keeper of the palace of Linlithgow, and of the state prison Blackness Castle, the earl was involved in the show trial of six dissident Presbyterian ministers in 1606. David Calderwood noted that his wife on this occasion was &#145;howbeit an obstinat papist, but now a zealous professour&#146;, who received the ministers &#145;verie courteouslie&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.375). Linlithgow was forced to inform the king in 1607 that the palace's north quarter had collapsed through neglect (it was eventually rebuilt in 1618).<br>
<br>Linlithgow attended the privy council for the last time on 30 September 1618, though he remained nominally a councillor until his death. The five articles of Perth introduced kneeling at communion in 1618, and as a councillor Linlithgow received an order to communicate kneeling at Easter 1619. He refused, citing sickness as an excuse but indicating tacit disapproval of the articles. He gave a proxy to his son-in-law the earl of Eglinton to attend the parliament of August 1621. Eglinton used it to cast Linlithgow's vote against the ratification of the articles. Whether this accorded with Linlithgow's own views cannot be proved conclusively, but Linlithgow could have given his proxy instead to another son-in-law, the earl of Wigtown, who voted with the government. Linlithgow died at Callendar House, near Falkirk, on 24 December 1621.<br>
