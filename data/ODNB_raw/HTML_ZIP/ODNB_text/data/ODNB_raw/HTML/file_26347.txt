</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Steele, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1672, <em>d.</em> 1729), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was born in St Bride's parish, Dublin, and baptized at the parish church on 12 March 1672, the second child and only son of Richard Steele, an attorney, and Elinor Symes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sheyles. His grandfather, also Richard Steele, an explorer in Persia and India, and known to Samuel Purchas and Thomas Coryat, had been awarded a pension by Charles I for his services and acquired land around Ballinakill in Queen's county (co. Laois) and near New Ross in co. Wexford. Steele was thus born into the protestant gentry, and his primary education seems to have been private&#151;as appropriate to that class. His contemporary Jonathan Swift was born into precisely the same segment of society: this fact was the fuel of the personal animosity between the two later in life.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Richard, the father, was in declining health and died when Steele was still a child, probably about 1676 or 1677. The care of Steele and his sister Katherine, born in 1671, was assumed by their paternal aunt Katherine Steele Mildmay, widow of Sir Humphry Mildmay, who in 1675 married Henry Gascoigne, private secretary to the first duke of Ormond. Ormond, twice viceroy of Ireland, was succeeded in that office in 1684 and returned to England with his entourage. Gascoigne and his wife lived in Fulham and on 17 November 1684 Richard Steele was entered in the Charterhouse School, then in its location in central London. Steele's admission was no doubt on the interest of Ormond, who was a governor of the institution. In 1686 Joseph Addison enrolled at the Charterhouse and the basis was laid for one of literature's most celebrated collaborations.<br>
<br>The Charterhouse curriculum aimed to prepare students for the universities. In 1689 Steele, judged proficient enough in Greek and Latin, went up to Oxford and on 21 December signed the entry book at Christ Church. The dean, Henry Aldrich, had been tutor to the second duke of Ormond, the first duke's grandson, who had elected to support William in the revolution of 1688. Aldrich had received his appointment as dean largely as a reward for his earlier opposition to James II's attempts to augment Catholic influence in the university.<br>
<br>Steele's friend Addison was enjoying some intellectual celebrity as the holder of a demyship at Magdalen College and in August 1691 Steele migrated to Merton College as a scholar on the foundation. The expectation was that, like Addison, he would eventually proceed to a fellowship. Many years later Steele recalled Merton as &#145;that college I am more particularly obliged to&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Englishman</span>, 22 Dec 1713). His stay there, however, was comparatively brief: in May 1692 he took his final meals in college and departed, in his own account, to plant &#145;himself behind King <i>William</i> the Third, against <i>Lewis</i> the Fourteenth&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Theatre</span>, 11, 6 Feb 1720). Nothing more is known of Steele's decision to leave Oxford without a degree.<h2>
<a name="CaptainSteele"></a>Captain Steele</h2>Probably in the summer of 1692 Steele enlisted in the second troop of Life Guards, commanded by the duke of Ormond. Troopers in this &eacute;lite regiment were referred to as &#145;private gentlemen&#146; and addressed as &#145;Mister&#146;. It was, however, a combat unit and during the summers of 1692 and 1694 engaged in active operations in Flanders.<br>
<br>In April 1695 Steele saw published, no doubt at his own expense, a small pamphlet in folio entitled <span class="italic">The Procession. A Poem on her Majesties Funeral</span>, &#145;By a Gentleman of the Army&#146;. The poem, in pentameter couplets, which describes the funeral ceremonies for Queen Mary the preceding month, has significance only as Steele's first published work and because it was dedicated to John, Baron Cutts (1661&#150;1707), commanding officer of the 2nd foot guards, the Coldstream regiment. Some time in 1695 Steele left the Life Guards and joined the Coldstream, probably as a &#145;gentleman of the company&#146; until his commission as ensign in Cutts's own company came through in April 1697. As such, Cutts was the titular and Steele the actual company commander, with the brevet rank of captain. The sobriquet by which he was known for many years, Captain Steele, thus dates from April 1697.<br>
<br>In addition to his military duties Steele was serving as private secretary to Lord Cutts, a post which perhaps broadened his acquaintanceship in London society. Some time in these years Steele involved himself in alchemical experiments, with the hope of a quick financial return but the reality of lost money and credit in the refining fires. He fathered an illegitimate daughter about this time; the mother, Elizabeth, was the unmarried daughter of Richard Tonson the bookseller. Steele saw to the care of the child, named Elizabeth Ousley; the Tonson family seem to have borne him no ill will because Elizabeth's brother Jacob Tonson in later years became Steele's principal publisher. In June 1700 Steele attracted further notoriety by fighting a duel with another Irishman in Hyde Park and almost killing his opponent, probably an officer of the Queen's regiment of dragoons named Henry Kelly. Later, in his plays and essays, Steele became one of the most vocal critics of duelling. In the same year he contributed a poem in defence of Addison to a collection entitled <span class="italic">Commendatory Verses</span>. The volume was a reply to Sir Richard Blackmore's <span class="italic">Satyr Against Wit</span>, which had attacked Dryden and his followers, including Addison. Captain Steele was in effect announcing his literary ambitions and associating himself with the wits.<br>
<br>The immediate products of Steele's ambitions were his first major publications: <span class="italic">The Christian Hero</span>, a quasi-philosophical tract, and <span class="italic">The Funeral</span>, a stage comedy. Both appeared in 1701. Steele's pamphlet, which ran to some twenty editions in the century, decries neostoicism with its emphasis on pagan virtues and celebrates, as the title indicates, the Christian hero, especially as exemplified by the soldier king William. <span class="italic">The Funeral</span> was published by Jacob Tonson in December (with the date 1702 on the title-page), to coincide with the opening of the comedy at the Drury Lane Theatre in that month. The principal players&#151;Robert Wilks, Colley Cibber, Anne Oldfield&#151;were to be associated with Steele for the rest of his life, in his career as playwright and theatre governor. With incidental music by Daniel Purcell, <span class="italic">The Funeral</span> had &#145;more than expected Success&#146;  (Cibber, 153). Years later Steele looked back on his triumphant d&eacute;but: &#145;Nothing can make the Town so fond of a Man as a successful Play&#146;  (Steele, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, in <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, 339). The play, with its patriotic motifs, apparently attracted the favourable attention of the king himself. As renewal of the wars with France approached in 1702, Steele received a captaincy in the newly formed 34th foot.<br>
<br>To his chagrin Steele's company, recruited by him in Essex and Norfolk, was assigned to Landguard Fort, a dilapidated structure guarding the approaches to Harwich in Suffolk. Steele spent his time repairing the fabric of the old fort and drilling his green recruits, but also in learning Harwich politics at the grassroots. The new member for Harwich, John Ellis, had been an associate of Henry Gascoigne in the Ormond circle and Steele began supplying him confidential information on the electorate. Steele was also writing another play, according to plausible local tradition working on it at the Queen's Arms in Harwich. <span class="italic">The Lying Lover</span>, produced at Drury Lane in December 1703, ran for only six performances, producing two benefit nights for the author but little else. Steele's dedication of the printed play, published by Bernard Lintott, was to the second duke of Ormond, then raising a new regiment of dragoons. The dedication secured him no appointment. Distress over this denial of preferment or perhaps the death in January 1705 of the 34th's commanding officer, Lord Lucas, may have precipitated Steele's decision to leave the army. He had no prospects of promotion at Landguard Fort under a stranger's command.<h2>
<a name="Progressandpreferment"></a>Progress and preferment</h2>Whatever his motivation, Steele was back in London to stay in the spring of 1705, witnessing the production of his third play and preparing to marry for the first time. <span class="italic">The Tender Husband</span>, a comedy, had a brief initial run, and only one author's benefit performance in April 1705. It returned to Drury Lane for performances later in the year and remained a staple of the London stage repertory for many decades, without remuneration for the author. It is significant that Steele did not have another new play produced until many years later when he was a partner in the Drury Lane management and thus able to reap rewards both as author and as manager.<br>
<br>Addison was also in London and according to Steele contributed &#145;many applauded Stroaks&#146; to the play  (<span class="italic">Spectator</span>, no. 555). Well constructed, <span class="italic">The Tender Husband</span> is thought by many to be the best, though not the most influential, of Steele's stage comedies. Of biographical interest is the hero, Captain Clerimont, a young army officer in marital pursuit of an heiress. In April or May 1705 Captain Steele himself pursued and married an heiress, Margaret Stretch, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ford, a widow formerly of Barbados. Her estate there including sugar plantations was let two years later for &pound;850 a year. Steele had married a considerable fortune, which he immediately, and characteristically, began entangling in his own indebtedness. By December 1706 Margaret Stretch was dead. A single reference to her in a letter from Steele (to his second wife's mother) constitutes all that is known about Steele's feeling for her or hers for Steele: &#145;My Late Wife had so extreme a Value for Me that she by Fine Convey'd to Me Her whole estate Situate in Barbados&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 201). Her burial place is unknown.<br>
<br>Steele met Mary Scurlock (1678&#150;1718), a young woman of Irish descent living in Wales, at his first wife's funeral. He pursued her with the ardour of a Captain Clerimont, assuring her in a letter of courtship that &#145;Instead of saying, I shall die for you, I professe I should be glad to Lead my life with you; you are as Beautiful as Witty as prudent, and as good humoured as any woman breathing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 190). The couple were married at St Mary Somerset in the City on 9 September 1707.<br>
<br>In his public life meanwhile Steele had been achieving, in small ways, some recognition. The parliamentary elections of May 1705 had strengthened the position of the junto whigs. Probably about this time Steele was admitted to the whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>, of which Addison was already a member. Steele wrote the prologue to John Vanbrugh's new play, <span class="italic">The Mistake</span>, in December. Vanbrugh, architect and playwright, was an important Kit-Cat. In the summer of 1706 Steele's &#145;Prologue to the University of Oxford&#146;, written for the opening of a series of dramatic performances, was read there. In August he received his first civil preferment, an appointment as gentleman waiter to Queen Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark, with a stipend of &pound;100 a year, free of taxes.<br>
<br>More preferment was forthcoming. The junto whig Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland, was sworn in as secretary of state for the southern department in December. His under-secretary was Joseph Addison. In late April or early May 1707 Steele, doubtless on Addison's recommendation, was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, the official government news medium, at a salary of &pound;300 a year. This was Steele's introduction to periodical publication and important training for his future ventures in the field, but it was not inspiring work; he later recalled that he had laboured &#145;to keep that paper very innocent and very insipid&#146;  (Steele, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, in <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, 339). His proposal that the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> appear three times instead of twice a week, to meet increased demand by the public for news, was ignored. Prince George died in October 1708 and in December Steele was passed over for the vacant position of under-secretary of state, Addison having gone to Ireland as secretary to the lord lieutenant. It may have seemed to Steele time for a change. His creditors were, as usual, pressing him on every side.<h2>
<a name="TatlerandSpectator"></a>Tatler and Spectator</h2>
<span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, which appeared in its first issue on 12 April 1709, was very much Steele's own creation, even as he drew on editorial techniques and printing technology already being used in London. These he had learned from directing <span class="italic">The Gazette</span>'s operations and observing those of its competitors. <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> would, for example, appear <i>three</i> times a week, to coincide with the postal service leaving London for the provinces, which also carried competing manuscript newsletters directed to subscribers there. The price would be competitive as well: gratis for the first four issues and thenceforth a penny. The low price was possible because of the paper's format: a folio half-sheet, printed on both sides, the cheapest form possible. Distribution at the beginning was direct to the London public by way of hawkers, an order of salespersons almost exclusively women and referred to by Steele, in the paper's first advertisement  (<span class="italic">Tatler</span>, no. 4, verso) as &#145;Running Stationers&#146;. Steele's publisher was the trade publisher John Morphew, who purveyed ephemera, anonymous pamphlets, and the like. Jacob Tonson, who had already published two of Steele's plays, declined to publish, if he was offered, what must have appeared a most marginal enterprise. The printer was John Nutt, who did not get around to registering the copyright until 2 May 1710, perhaps indicating his own reservations about the new paper.<br>
<br>Yet <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> was an immediate and continuing success. The supposed author or editorial persona, &#145;Isaac Bickerstaff&#146;, had become known to London readers as a participant in the elaborate literary hoax invented and pursued by Jonathan Swift and others in Bickerstaff's name a year earlier. In the first <span class="italic">Tatler</span> &#145;Bickerstaff&#146; indicated that he intended to supply information for the male readers and entertainment for the female, a refurbishing of Horace's famous dictum. In the event he supplied both to both; it was a condition of the paper's success.<br>
<br>Another condition of that success was Steele's ability to attract other contributors to the paper. Swift, for example, appearing as Humphrey Wagstaff, &#145;an Ingenious Kinsman of mine&#146;, provided his &#145;Description of the morning&#146; for the ninth <span class="italic">Tatler</span>. Addison began sending excellent material from Ireland. By drawing on his friends Steele was making a virtue of necessity because in that spring of 1709 he was editing two periodicals simultaneously, and seeing five issues of them through the press every week.<br>
<br>Though Steele introduced political material from time to time, as in his allegorical presentation of the junto whig leadership in no. 4, he did not make politics a major element of the paper. Nor, after the opening weeks, was news offered, in the sense of diurnal chronicling. Theatrical criticism was presented in no. 1 and continued regularly thereafter. In the paper's early days Steele used the &#145;departments&#146; which he had formed in the first issue; this made for short entries of a few hundred words under each by-line. Soon the paper evolved toward the single essay of some 1500 or 2000 words that would fill both sides of the half-sheet, minus the advertising. This was the informal essay, descended ultimately from Montaigne, which became in <span class="italic">Tatler</span> form the periodical essay and gave the name to its vehicle, the essay periodical.<br>
<br>The Steeles' first child, a daughter named Elizabeth, was born in March 1709, and their first son, Richard, in May 1710. The whig Charles Montagu, Lord Halifax, stood as godfather for young Richard. Steele reaped one more sinecure from his association with the junto: in January 1710 a commissionership at the stamp office, with a stipend of &pound;300 a year. The strength of the whigs was declining, however, in 1710, and that of Robert Harley and his tory coalition waxing. When Steele published an overtly political <span class="italic">Tatler</span> (no. 130) in favour of the whig government, the new tory paper, <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> (31 August 1710), warned Bickerstaff: &#145;No more of your politick Lucubrations&#146;. In mid-October Steele resigned from <span class="italic">The Gazette</span>, as Harley consolidated his position, and on 2 January 1711 Steele wound up <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> with no. 271, signing his name at the close. Ending the paper may have been Harley's price for allowing Steele to continue as stamp commissioner; <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> and its editor had become identified with the whigs.<br>
<br>Addison was back in London, permanently, and as a whig out of office had time on his hands. The two planned a new periodical, to be called <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, with some care; it was probably Addison's prudential counsel that led them to adopt a non-partisan stance for it, leaving Steele free to write elsewhere for the party as he wished. In the first number (which appeared on 1 March 1711) the spokesman Mr Spectator declares that he will &#145;observe an exact Neutrality between the Whigs and Tories, unless I shall be forced to declare my self by the Hostilities of either Side&#146;. In no. 2 he describes the club of which he is a member and introduces his fellows: these are intended to replace in a sense the different departments of <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, offering Addison and Steele the opportunity to move in various directions with respect to content and at the same time separating the authors from their materials. Sir Roger de Coverley, that is, can mouth tory platitudes and Sir Andrew Freeport purvey whig truisms without associating Addison and Steele with either position. With respect to editorial tone <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> was both model and source for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. Mr Spectator spoke like Isaac Bickerstaff: learned, witty, affable, faintly patronizing.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Spectator</span> appeared six times a week, daily except Sunday. This required refining and expanding the advertising and distribution arrangements Steele had instituted for <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. By mid-March Addison could report a daily distribution of more than 3000; at 1<i>d</i>. per copy the paper was then grossing more than &pound;300 a month, not including revenue from extensive advertising and, in a few months, from collected reprints. Steele was the general editorial supervisor, responsible for seeing <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> through the press, in two printing shops. Both Addison and Steele supplied copy, as eventually did several of their acquaintances, among them Alexander Pope.<h2>
<a name="Politicsandplays"></a>Politics and plays</h2>In November 1711 Jonathan Swift published his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Allies</span>, which sought to discredit the departed whig government and their ally the duke of Marlborough. Steele replied, writing as Scoto-Britannus in <span class="italic">The Englishman's Thanks to the Duke of Marlborough</span>  (<span class="italic">Tracts</span>, 66&#150;71). This was the first of many political pamphlets written by Steele over the succeeding ten years. When his second son was born on 4 March 1712, the Steeles named him Eugene, in honour of Marlborough's fellow soldier Prince Eugene of Savoy. By the end of that year Addison and Steele were ready to close out <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and did so with no. 555, of 6 December 1712, in which Steele acknowledged over his signature some of those who had helped. He was not associated with the paper's brief revival in 1714.<br>
<br>Steele initiated another essay periodical, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, on 12 March 1713, with an editorial persona named Nestor Ironside. Jacob Tonson was now the publisher of this paper, signalling the escalating prestige and profits of essay periodicals. The fictional Lizard family of Lizard Hall, Northamptonshire, friends of Ironside, seems to have been designed to take over the functions of Mr Spectator's club, but <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> is chiefly remembered for the quality of the contributors on whom Steele drew, including Edward Young, George Berkeley, Alexander Pope, and of course Addison; and for the device he invented to receive letters to the paper: a lion's head set up in Button's Coffee House. A &#145;lion&#146; Steele had earlier identified as a &#145;great Man's Spy&#146;. Steele himself wrote letters to the editor, under various disguises, as he had been doing since <span class="italic">Tatler</span> days. All these expedients were necessary to keep the paper appearing on the six issues a week timetable.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1713 Steele reassessed his situation. Early in the year his daughter Mary had been born, on the day his wife's mother, Elizabeth Scurlock, died. Mrs Scurlock left the Steeles a substantial estate in Carmarthenshire. This legacy may have emboldened Steele to enter politics directly. During the summer of 1713 Steele chose to sever all remaining ties with the tory ministry and run for parliament in the general elections approaching in the autumn. He resigned his preferments including his earliest, the pension as gentleman waiter to Prince George. Early in August Steele published a fiery political <span class="italic">Guardian</span> (no. 128), in which he arraigned the government's conduct concerning the destruction of Dunkirk in the recently concluded treaty of Utrecht. Spokesmen on Harley's payroll, including Daniel Defoe, chose to interpret the paper as an attack on the queen. <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> on 21 August 1713 called Steele's paper a &#145;scandalous libel&#146;. In the face of the government's displeasure Steele was elected a member of parliament for the borough of Stockbridge in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Elated no doubt by his election, Steele turned <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> over to Addison in September and on 22 September published a pamphlet over his signature called <span class="italic">The Importance of Dunkirk Consider'd</span>, which marked his full-time entry into the propaganda wars. The pamphlet sold well, going to a third edition within a week, and the tories determined to strike back at Steele, along two lines of attack. The first was to find ways of expelling him from his seat in parliament; the second was by direct answers to his pamphlet. Defoe published an anonymous reply that month, and Swift his masterly <i>ad hominem</i> assault on Steele, <span class="italic">The Importance of the Guardian Considered</span>, also anonymous, in October.<br>
<br>By then Steele, on 1 October, had ended <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, without notice or explanation. He began a new essay periodical within the week, styled <span class="italic">The Englishman</span>, the narrator of which related that he had &#145;purchased the Lion, Desk, Pen, Ink, and Paper &hellip; of NESTOR IRONSIDE, Esq.&#146;. This was intended to be a political journal, however, and it remained so, with a few exceptional issues&#151;such as the account in no. 26 of Alexander Selkirk's marooning on Juan Fernandez Island, a paper often cited as a source for <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>.<br>
<br>Steele continued publishing <span class="italic">The Englishman</span> in November and December and was at the same time preparing a pamphlet on the present situation, as the whigs saw it, to be titled <span class="italic">The Crisis</span>. The crisis in question was that of the royal succession: Queen Anne's health, never hearty, had worsened, and rumours were widespread that the Catholic Pretender might be introduced on her death. Tories took the position that there was no crisis and that Steele's allegations constituted sedition. When <span class="italic">The Crisis</span> was published with his name on the title-page, it had a sensational sale: a hostile writer estimated that 40,000 copies were sold. No masterpiece of prose, <span class="italic">The Crisis</span> nevertheless made its point as whig propaganda. In retrospect its importance may be seen as a landmark, the earliest use of mass printing, advertising, and distribution techniques in a political context. Steele lent his encyclopaedic knowledge of printing and distribution to the whig cause: the employment of co-ordinated multiple printing presses and distribution networks, which had been invented to manufacture and circulate his periodicals, both within London and to the provinces, was here devoted to political rather than literary ends.<br>
<br>In the tory reply, <span class="italic">The Publick Spirit of the Whigs</span>, Swift met Steele's arguments by blandly denying that the Hanoverian succession was in danger at all, and proceeding against the whig author himself, branding his doubts about the situation &#145;sedition&#146;. This was a key term: Harley's ministry intended to punish Steele by charging him with sedition. Unlike most political writers of the day he had signed his name to his propaganda, providing a convenient handle to his enemies. The result was a foregone conclusion: the ministry had the votes in the House of Commons to make the charge stick. Although ably defended by Robert Walpole, Steele was expelled from the house on 18 March 1714 by a vote of 245 to 152.<br>
<br>That spring Steele occupied his newly found leisure by writing and editing two more periodicals, <span class="italic">The Lover</span> and <span class="italic">The Reader</span>. <span class="italic">The Lover</span>, edited by one &#145;Marmaduke Myrtle, Gent.&#146;, was, as Marmaduke describes it in the first number of February, designed &#145;to trace the Passion or Affection of Love&#146;. It was a topic on which Steele could pronounce with some authority. He had occasional assistance for this thrice-weekly publication but <span class="italic">The Lover</span> was essentially his own. It includes some of his most effective essays. The paper, which ran for forty issues, was highly regarded in Steele's day: five collected editions appeared during his lifetime and four more before the end of the century. <span class="italic">The Reader</span>, entirely devoted to politics&#151;that is, the succession crisis&#151;lasted for only nine issues in April and May.<br>
<br>With the death of Queen Anne in August 1714 and the accession of George I, Steele's political fortunes changed abruptly. The tories were turned out of office and the whigs began a long period of political dominance. The cavalry veteran Steele was named surveyor of the royal stables at Hampton Court. In October he was offered and accepted the governorship of the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, with a stipend of &pound;700 a year. This was a political reward, of course, but Steele was in fact seen by many as uniquely qualified for the post: he had known the London theatrical scene since his days as a schoolboy at Charterhouse, first as a member of the audience, then as a practising playwright, finally as a working journalist. Under the terms of the licence, day-to-day conduct of the theatre's affairs remained in the hands of three actor&#150;managers, Robert Wilks, Colley Cibber, and Barton Booth. They had invited Steele to seek the appointment in the first place, conscious, as Cibber later put it, that &#145;many Days had our House been particularly fill'd, by the Influence, and Credit of his Pen&#146;  (Cibber, 290).<br>
<br>Steele intended to undertake an active role as governor and perhaps write plays and see them produced but the pull of political life proved too strong. A safe seat in parliament was found for him, Boroughbridge in Yorkshire, to which he was duly elected in 1715. On 9 April of that year he was knighted by George I. This was a political reward, bestowed not on the essayist and dramatist but on the pamphleteer and member of parliament, and Sir Richard understood this.<br>
<br>Steele was busy in parliament, sitting on more than a dozen committees during his first year of service in the house. The government called on him to start a periodical that would be used to discredit the fallen tories, a group which included his former commanding officer, the duke of Ormond. In June 1715 the impeachment of Harley was moved; in the next month Steele began his new paper, called <span class="italic">The Englishman</span> like his periodical of 1713&#150;14, but published anonymously. It was an undertaking that Steele did not relish&#151;he esteemed personally both Ormond and Harley&#151;but he dutifully wrote and edited the twice-weekly propaganda sheet and even made money at a break-even point of 240 copies sold per issue. News that the Pretender's supporters had risen in Scotland injected life briefly into <span class="italic">The Englishman</span>. The defeat of a Jacobite army at Preston early in November signalled the beginning of the end and Steele wrapped up his paper, probably with relief, with no. 38 of 21 November.<br>
<br>Steele's next essay periodical, <span class="italic">Town Talk. In a Letter to a Lady in the Country</span>, first appeared early in December 1715 and consisted essentially of current theatrical criticism, which Steele had virtually invented in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. Steele writes about the importance of producing plays of merit, and Drury Lane was then mounting a total of eight plays by Shakespeare during the season. He discusses Addison's new play, <span class="italic">The Drummer</span>, as an example of the encouragement of good living writers. <span class="italic">Town Talk</span> ended with the ninth number.<br>
<br>In June 1716 Steele was named to the commission which would administer and sell the estates of noblemen involved in the Pretender's rising, at a stipend of &pound;1000 a year. That spring Steele suffered a severe seizure, leaving him helpless and immobile, which his physician Dr John Woodward diagnosed as gout, but which must in fact have been a stroke. Steele, during his convalescence, was investing energy and money in a scheme, ultimately unsuccessful, called the Fish Pool, which sought to deliver live fish to the London market.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>During the autumn of 1717 Steele was well enough to travel to Edinburgh for the meeting of the forfeited estates commission. He reported to his wife that he &#145;never lay better ate or drank better, or conversed with men of better sense than there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 384). On 26 December 1718 Lady Steele, &#145;Dear Prue&#146; always to her husband, died, probably of complications during pregnancy, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Another chapter in Steele's life ended the following year on an equally sad note. During a parliamentary debate concerning representation in the House of Lords, the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span>, Steele found himself in opposition. Addison represented the government in a periodical called the <span class="italic">Old Whig</span>. Steele, in his new periodical, <span class="italic">The Plebeian</span>, alleged that Addison was only masquerading as a whig: &#145;I am afraid he is so <i>old a Whig</i> that he has quite <i>forgot his Principles</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tracts</span>, 470). The famous friendship ended in a political wrangle. Addison named James Craggs his literary executor&#151;a pointed affront to Steele&#151;and died on 17 June 1719.<br>
<br>In retribution for his part in opposing them, the government, represented by the duke of Newcastle as lord chamberlain, moved to revoke Steele's licence as manager of Drury Lane. Steele began what was to be the last of his periodicals, <span class="italic">The Theatre</span>, on 2 January 1720. He pleaded his side of the case in the new paper but also called on long editorial expertise to produce a lively publication, mingling comment and anecdote in his familiar manner. The paper succeeded beyond the printer's expectations, requiring reprints to meet the demand. Steele was, however, effectively excluded from the Drury Lane enterprise. When he ended <span class="italic">The Theatre</span> with no. 28 on 5 April 1720 and prepared to go to Scotland for the commission meetings it seemed that his career in the theatre might be over. But in 1721, in the aftermath of the South Sea scandal, Steele's friend Robert Walpole took control of the ministry and had Newcastle restore Steele to his place in the management of Drury Lane. There Steele saw the opening of his latest play, <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>, on 7 November 1722. It was his greatest success in the theatre, though not his best play, and its place in theatrical history&#151;with its pathetic, or tragicomic, main plot and comic subplot&#151;is still the subject of critical debate.<br>
<br>Steele's health began to decline markedly about then. In order to pay his debts and leave something to his two surviving daughters he retired to Carmarthen, where he had inherited a house from his wife. There he worked on a comedy, <span class="italic">The School of Action</span>; surviving fragments of the manuscript are preserved in the British Library. But Steele knew that his days were numbered; the play was never finished. He retired first to Hereford, and then to Carmarthen, where he lived chiefly at Ty-Gwyn, a farmhouse overlooking the Towy. He died at a house in King Street, Carmarthen, on the night of 1 September 1729 and was buried in St Peter's Church there on 4 September.<br>
<br>Steele was a successful playwright. It may be that his principal dramatic legacy was not the much debated sentimental comedy but rather the gallery of broad comic roles he created in his plays. Some of his essays have stood the test of time as well, but from the twenty-first century's perspective it is probably his mastery and employment of the emerging techniques of print culture&#151;a number of which he originated himself&#151;that represent his most enduring achievement.<br>
