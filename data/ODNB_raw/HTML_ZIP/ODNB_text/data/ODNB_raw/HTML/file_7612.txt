</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dickson, Sir  Alexander</span>  (1777&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 3 June 1777 at Sydenham House, Roxburghshire, the third son of Admiral William Dickson and his first wife, daughter of William Collingwood of Unthank, Northumberland. His brother was Admiral Sir Collingwood Dickson, second baronet. He was educated presumably at a private school. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet on 5 April 1793 and became second lieutenant Royal Artillery on 6 November 1794. His subsequent commissions in the British artillery were first lieutenant (6 March 1795), captain-lieutenant (14 October 1801), captain (10 April 1805), major (26 June 1823), lieutenant-colonel (2 April 1825), and colonel (1 July 1836). As a subaltern he served at the capture of Minorca in 1798, and at the blockade of Malta and siege of Valletta in 1800, where he was employed as acting engineer. As captain he commanded the artillery of the reinforcements sent out to South America under Sir Samuel Auchmuty, which arrived at the River Plate on 5 April 1807 and captured Montevideo, and which was afterwards present at, but not engaged in, the disastrous attempt to take Buenos Aires. For a time Dickson commanded the artillery of the army, in which he was succeeded by Augustus Frazer.<br>
<br>When Colonel Howorth arrived in Portugal to assume command of the artillery of the army of Arthur Wellesley (the duke of Wellington) in April 1809, Dickson, who hoped to obtain employment in a higher grade in the Portuguese artillery under Marshal W. C. Beresford, accompanied Howorth and served as his brigade major in the operations before Porto and the subsequent expulsion of Mar&eacute;chal Soult's army from Portugal. Soon afterwards he was appointed to a company in the Portuguese artillery when Captain John May returned home. He subsequently became major and lieutenant-colonel in the Portuguese service, which gave him precedence over officers who were his seniors in the British artillery. In command of the Portuguese artillery he took part in the battle of Busaco in 1810, the action at Campo Mayor, the siege and capture of Olivenza, and the battle of Albuera in 1811. His abilities were recognized by Wellington, and the artillery details at the various sieges were chiefly entrusted to him. He superintended the artillery operations in the first and second sieges of Badajoz under the immediate orders of Wellington in 1811, as well as the siege and capture of Ciudad Rodrigo and the siege and capture of Badajoz in 1812. He joined the force assembled by Rowland Hill to march secretly against the forts at Almaraz. His feints and the planting of false information effectively screened his movements from the French, and the operation ended in a close-run but brilliant capture of the forts and bridge on the River Tagus. In 1812 he also contributed to the siege and capture of the forts of Salamanca, and the siege of Burgos. He commanded the reserve artillery at the battle of Salamanca and the capture of Madrid. He was a lieutenant-colonel in the Portuguese artillery, and brevet major and first captain of a company of British artillery (no. 5 of the Old 10th battalion Royal Artillery, which under its second captain, Cairns, did good service in the Peninsula and was afterwards disbanded). On 27 April 1812 he became brevet lieutenant-colonel in the British service. An earnest and active officer, he suffered recurring attacks of fever.<br>
<br>In May 1813 Wellington, whose relations with the commanding officers of the Royal Artillery in Spain for some time past had been very unsatisfactory, invited Dickson to take command of the allied artillery, his brevet rank giving him the necessary seniority. Dickson, still a captain of artillery, thus succeeded to what properly was a lieutenant-general's command, having 8000 men and between 3000 and 4000 horses under him. He commanded the allied artillery at Vitoria, and by virtue of his brevet rank was senior to Augustus Frazer (under whom he had served in South America) at the siege of San Sebastian, who wrote of his &#145;manly simplicity&#146;. Dickson commanded the allied artillery at the passage of the River Bidassoa, in the battles of the Nivelle and the Nive, at the passage of the River Adour, and in the battle of Toulouse. After the war the officers of the field train department who had served under him presented him with a splendid piece of plate, and the officers of the Royal Artillery who served under him in the campaigns of 1813&#150;14 presented him with a sword of honour.<br>
<br>In the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14 Dickson commanded the artillery in the expedition to New Orleans and at the capture of Fort Bowyer at Mobile, Alabama. He returned from the United States in time to take part in the Waterloo campaign. At this time he was first captain of G (afterwards F) troop, Royal Horse Artillery. He was present at the battles of Quatre-Bras and Waterloo in 1815, with Sir George Wood, commanding the artillery. He subsequently commanded the battering train sent to aid the Prussian army at the sieges of Maubeuge, Landrecies, Philipville, Marienburg, and Rocroy, in July and August of 1815, but which Wellington, disapproving of the acts of Prince Augustus of Prussia, directed later to withdraw to Mons. In all his campaigns Dickson was never once wounded.<br>
<br>In 1822 Dickson was appointed inspector of artillery, and he succeeded Lieutenant-General Sir John Macleod as deputy adjutant-general Royal Artillery on Macleod's removal to the office of director-general in 1827. On William Millar's death in 1838 Dickson succeeded him in the office of director-general of the field train department, combining this duty with that of deputy adjutant-general of Royal Artillery until his death in 1840; during this period artillery progress was stifled by parliamentary retrenchment. He became a major-general on 10 January 1837. In 1838 Dickson, who had been made KCH in 1817 and KCB in 1825, was made GCB, the only Royal Artillery officer then holding the grand cross of the military division. He was royal aide-de-camp (1825&#150;37), a commissioner of the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and was one of the original fellows of the Royal Geographical Society and a fellow of other learned societies.<br>
<br>Dickson was not only a great artilleryman but also a most industrious and methodical collector of data. During the Peninsula sieges he kept diaries, in which he mentioned even the most trifling facts, and on his return to England he obtained from General Macleod the letters he had written to him between 1811 and 1814. All this became the property of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32820/', "General Sir Collingwood Dickson (1817&#150;1904)")</script>, Royal Artillery, who lent it to Colonel Francis Duncan who used it in preparing his <span class="italic">History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery</span>.<br>
<br>Dickson was twice married, first, on 19 September 1802, to Eulalia Brion&egrave;s (<i>d</i>. 24 July 1830), daughter of Don Stefano Brion&egrave;s of Minorca, with whom he had a large family; and second, on 18 December 1830, to Harriet Maria, widow of Eustace Meadows of Conholt Park, Hampshire, who after Dickson's death married Major-General Sir John Campbell of the Portuguese service. He died at his residence in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 22 April 1840, at the age of sixty-two, and was buried on 28 April in Plumstead old churchyard, Plumstead, Middlesex. In 1847 a monument was erected by regimental subscription in the grounds of the Royal Military Repository, Woolwich. Sir Collingwood Dickson, Dickson's third son with his first wife, presented his father's papers to the Royal Regiment of Artillery: an edition of them, edited by J. H. Leslie, was published as <span class="italic">The Dickson Manuscripts</span> in 1908.<br>
