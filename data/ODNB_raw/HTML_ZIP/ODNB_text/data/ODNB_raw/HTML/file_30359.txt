<span class="headword">Akers, Sir  Wallace Alan</span>  (1888&#150;1954), <span class="occ">chemist and industrialist</span>, was born on 9 September 1888 at Walthamstow, the second child of Charles Akers, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Mary Ethelreda Brown. He was educated at Lake House School in Bexhill, and at Aldenham School. From there he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied chemistry and obtained first-class honours in 1909.<br>
<br>In 1911 Akers joined Brunner Mond &amp; Co. in Cheshire, the leading British firm of alkali manufacturers. Apart from a brief spell in the research laboratory, he was occupied with work in process technology. He was by training a physical chemist&#151;one of the first Oxford produced&#151;and the type of work he had in Cheshire suited him very well.<br>
<br>In 1924 Akers went for some three years to the Far East in the employment of the Borneo Company Ltd. Meanwhile, Imperial Chemical Industries had been formed in 1926, absorbing, among others, Brunner Mond, and in 1928 he returned to London to work in close conjunction with Colonel George Paton Pollitt who was then ICI's technical director. This work gave Akers wide experience in many branches of chemical technology, and in 1931 he was made chairman of ICI's Billingham division. Work there was essentially concerned with high pressure techniques using hydrogen. Ammonia synthesis was a major interest at this time.<br>
<br>From 1933 to 1936 Akers was responsible for an interesting project at Billingham which aimed to produce 100,000 tons of petrol a year by the hydrogenation of coal. At their most ambitious the executives at ICI saw this project as the beginning of a new industry which would compete with the oil companies in the production of petrol. The expense of the process and the commercial power of the oil companies made this a very risky undertaking, and Akers had been closely involved in negotiations intended to procure financial support from the government to set up this experimental industry. In the spring of 1931 he met a strong rebuff from the civil servant responsible, Sir John Anderson, whose skilful investigation had brought out the fact that ICI had already made a substantial investment in the project, which it was seeking to rescue. Akers and his colleagues resumed their negotiations with the government after the election of October 1931, obtaining some measure of success by 1933.<br>
<br>After a reorganization of the company in 1937, Akers's chairmanship of the Billingham division came to an end and he returned to ICI headquarters. There he worked with Holbrook Gaskell, especially in connection with the enormous wartime factory expansion programme. In 1939 he was appointed an executive manager. In this capacity he was involved early on in secret informal co-operation between the company and the government on the project to prepare an atomic bomb. In 1941 he took part in a bid by the company to take over the entire nuclear project and run it on behalf of the Ministry of Aircraft Production; indeed according to one civil servant he was the plan's &#145;chief protagonist&#146;  (Gowing, 109). Though this takeover attempt was firmly rejected, he was nevertheless selected to become the director of the atomic project, working as a temporary civil servant responsible to Anderson, who was now a senior minister in the war cabinet.<br>
<br>Akers's appointment in 1941 as director of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93791', "Tube Alloys")</script> (the codename for atomic research) in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research caused some resentment among civil servants and scientists who were suspicious of his connections with ICI, but this soon dissipated once they got to know him. Things were, however, more difficult in the United States, where his involvement created the suspicion that Britain might be using the research with an eye to post-war economic gain. General Leslie Groves, who was placed in charge of the Manhattan project, was unwilling to deal with him, and this was a significant factor in the temporary breakdown of co-operation over nuclear matters. After the re-establishment of the partnership in August 1943, the United States government made it clear that it considered him unsuitable to be in charge of liaison between the British and American ends of the project, and Sir James Chadwick was given this responsibility in his stead (as technical adviser to the Combined Policy Committee). Contemporaries noted that Akers responded to this difficult situation with characteristic good grace. He remained head of Tube Alloys in Britain, retaining an important role in co-ordinating the activities of scientists engaged in nuclear research in Britain, but as he no longer had access to all the information on joint research being conducted in the United States, his input to decision making was much reduced.<br>
<br>Akers returned to full-time employment in ICI in 1946. In 1944 he had been appointed the company's first director to be specifically responsible for research, a post which he held until he retired in 1953. His juniors found him &#145;warm and friendly, with something of a donnish touch&#146;  (Reader, 447&#150;8). He was strongly associated with ICI's post-war efforts to support fundamental research, &#145;freed from the urgencies and distractions of [the] applied research&#146; already being carried out by the divisions  (ibid., 447), and the laboratory complex set up for this purpose was renamed the Akers Research Laboratories in 1955. As part of the same policy he introduced ICI research fellowships, by which the company became involved in research carried out in university laboratories.<br>
<br>Akers was made CBE for his war services in 1944, and knighted in 1946. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1952. He was a most clubbable man. For many years he resided in the Royal Thames Yacht Club where he delighted in having friends and acquaintances to dine. A hard worker, he readily occupied himself reading and writing to the small hours. In April 1953 he served as one of the three members of the committee that devised the Atomic Energy Authority. He was interested in music and art, and a good pianist until he suffered a hand injury. He was a member of the scientific advisory committee, and subsequently a trustee, of the National Gallery.<br>
<br>Akers received the honorary degrees of DSc from Durham (1949) and DCL from Oxford (1952), and was elected FRS in 1952. He was treasurer of the Chemical Society from 1948 until 1954. He has been described as a &#145;tall, lean figure&#146;, with a &#145;blind eye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chemistry and Industry</span>, 1449). On his retirement in 1953 he married Mademoiselle Bernadette Marie La Marre. This surprised all who knew him, for he had been considered a confirmed bachelor. The couple made their home at Yledyn, King's Road, Alton, Hampshire, where he died, on 1 November 1954. His widow returned to France where she survived him by nearly six years.<br>
