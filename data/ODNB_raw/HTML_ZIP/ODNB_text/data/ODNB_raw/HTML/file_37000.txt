<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wood, Sir  (Henry) Evelyn</span>  (1838&#150;1919), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Cressing, Essex, on 9 February 1838, the youngest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29885/', "Revd Sir John Page Wood, bt (1796&#150;1866)")</script>, rector of St Peter's, Cornhill, and vicar of Cressing [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29889/', "Wood, Sir Matthew, first baronet")</script>], and Emma Caroline Michell (1802&#150;1879), daughter of Admiral Sampson Michell of Croft West, Cornwall. Wood's uncle was Lord Hatherley, and his sister Katharine (Kitty) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39634/', "Parnell, Katharine")</script>] married W. H. O'Shea and later C. S. Parnell.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Wood attended Marlborough grammar school (1847&#150;9) and Marlborough College (1849&#150;52), leaving to enter the navy as a midshipman on 15 April 1852, after what he regarded as an unjust caning. In 1854 he was serving with HMS <i>Queen</i> off the Crimea and went ashore with the naval brigade. He was wounded while aide-de-camp to the brigade commander in the assault on the Redan on 18 June 1855, having risen from a sickbed in order to participate in the attack. Upon recovering, he opted to transfer to the 13th light dragoons, in which he was commissioned on 7 September, and went back to the Crimea. After contracting typhoid and pneumonia in January 1856 he was nursed back to health by his mother, who travelled out to Scutari to do so. Having been promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1856 Wood returned to his regiment in Ireland, but transferred to the 17th lancers on 9 October 1857, embarking for India in 1858.<br>
<br>During the Indian mutiny, from May 1858 until October 1860, Wood served on operations in central India, acting as brigade major to a flying column between November 1858 and April 1859 and receiving the Victoria Cross for routing, with ten men, eighty mutineers at Sindhara on 29 December 1859. He was promoted captain on 16 April 1861 and received a brevet majority on 19 August 1862 for his mutiny services. Although he passed the entrance examination for the Staff College in 1862 Wood was unable to take up the appointment, as one of his seniors took precedence at a time when only one officer a year could attend from each cavalry regiment, and he exchanged as a captain into the 73rd foot on 21 October 1862. He was then able to attend the Staff College in 1863, and after passing out filled a number of staff appointments, as aide-de-camp to William Napier in Dublin from January 1865 to March 1866, and successively brigade major and deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot from July 1866 to November 1871.<h2>
<a name="Marriage"></a>Marriage</h2>In the summer of 1867 he married the Hon. Mary Paulina Anne Southwell, a sister of the fourth Viscount Southwell and a Roman Catholic; they had three sons and three daughters. Wood was very close to his chief staff officer in South Africa in 1879, the Hon. Ronald Campbell, who was killed at Hlobane, but there is no real evidence to sustain allegations made in the early 1990s&#151;largely in connection with his later role in promoting the career of Douglas Haig&#151;that Wood was homosexual. Moreover, his wife's death in May 1891 was a severe blow to him, although their perceived mutual lack of some of the social graces had proved something of a handicap to Wood's career. Wolseley, for example, was to complain in October 1880 of the noise, poor food, and filth within the Wood household, while the duke of Cambridge opposed his appointment to the Aldershot command in November 1888 on the grounds that the Woods would make &#145;a very rough couple&#146;  (Cambridge to Ponsonby, 19 Nov 1888, Royal Archives, W10/82). Another important influence on Wood was his sister, the novelist Anna Steele, who allegedly wrote most of his speeches.<h2>
<a name="Aburgeoningcareer"></a>A burgeoning career</h2>Wood was promoted to an unattached majority on 22 June 1870 and then purchased a majority in the 90th light infantry on 28 October 1871. He was one of the last officers to so obtain promotion before the abolition of purchase, and he gained a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 19 January 1873 in consequence of the seniority achieved by his purchase. Having met Wolseley by chance in the War Office in May, while the former was planning the Asante expedition, and joked that his naval background would enable him to navigate west African waterways, Wood was summoned for special service on Wolseley's staff on 12 September 1873. In the Asante kingdom he raised and commanded African levies in the advance on Kumasi, and was slightly wounded at Amoaful on 30 January 1874. For his services he received a brevet colonelcy and the CB on 1 April 1874. His reputation now established as a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69913/', "Wolseley ring")</script>, he lectured on his Asante experiences at the Royal United Service Institution in June 1874. He served at Aldershot between September 1874 and February 1878, first as superintending officer of garrison instruction, then as assistant quartermaster-general. Wood also studied law and was called to the bar in 1874. In 1877 he was offered command of the Staff College, but declined, as he felt George Colley would be more suitable: but Colley also declined. However, Wood was chosen for special service in South Africa, where his name was soon to become familiar to the public in a way which would give him some independence from Wolseley's patronage.<h2>
<a name="InSouthAfrica"></a>In South Africa</h2>Wood joined the staff of Lieutenant-General Thesiger, later Lord Chelmsford, tasked with concluding the Cape Frontier War of 1877&#150;8. Wood commanded a column with ability and resolution, and on 13 November 1878 he succeeded to the command of his former battalion, the 90th, which had arrived in South Africa in the previous January. The war had hardly ended when that against the Zulu began, and Wood was given command of Chelmsford's no. 4 column at Utrecht, in the Transvaal, intended to safeguard the left flank of the British invasion of Zululand. When Chelmsford's main force met disaster at Isandlwana on 22 January 1879 and the right flanking force became besieged at Eshowe, only Wood's column was free to maintain offensive operations, from a base established at Khambula. Wood and Redvers Buller, commanding the frontier light horse, relentlessly harried the local Zulu of the Qulusi clan to the extent that the main Zulu army was dispatched towards Khambula. Having chosen to raid the Qulusi mountain stronghold at Hlobane for cattle on 28 March, Wood and Buller were caught there by the advance of this impi. Buller suffered heavy casualties in the confused and rapid descent from the top of Hlobane while Wood, originally intending to act in support of Buller, had become involved in a firefight at the eastern foot of the plateau in which Campbell and Wood's political agent were killed. Wood tried to extricate the two bodies but had to bury them hastily under fire. Hlobane was a disaster, Wood losing ninety-four white dead and more than a hundred of his African levies. However, securely entrenched back at Khambula, Wood immediately redeemed himself by repulsing the Zulu on the following day with such heavy loss&#151;probably more than 2000 dead compared with just eighteen dead among the defenders&#151;that it proved the turning point of the war. For the second invasion of Zululand in May 1879 Wood was appointed local brigadier-general and his force redesignated the flying column, linking with the 2nd division for the final push on Ulundi. With the defeat of the Zulu, Wood and Buller both chose to return to England rather than join Wolseley, who had come out to supersede Chelmsford, in the final pursuit of Cetshwayo.<br>
<br>Wood returned to a hero's welcome, receiving the KCB but not the major-general's rank he thought his due, and for which Wolseley and the queen both pressed, since it would appear that Cambridge was determined to frustrate those associated with Wolseley from preferment in defiance of normal rules of seniority wherever possible. Wood made a considerable impression on the queen, who received him at Balmoral in September 1879, and to whom he was to address extraordinarily sycophantic letters in subsequent years. Wood's third daughter, born in 1881, was named Victoria Eug&eacute;nie at the queen's wish. Compared with the reserved Buller, who accompanied him, Wood was &#145;wonderfully lively &amp; hardly ceases talking, which no doubt came from his deafness &amp; inability to hear any general conversation&#146;  (Victoria, 9 Sept 1879, Royal Archives, Z.388). The queen's private secretary, H. F. Ponsonby, feared Wood would be all too much for her but &#145;she hollered at him &amp; he went off at all rates&#146;  (Ponsonby to his wife, 10 Sept 1879, Royal Archives, Ponsonby MSS, Add. A36 Box 18).<h2>
<a name="Characterandhabits"></a>Character and habits</h2>It is not clear when Wood's deafness first occurred, but it was already pronounced by 1879 and became worse. Wood had two other abiding characteristics&#151;vanity and hypochondria. It was often said that he had his medal ribbons edged with a black border to accentuate their effect, while his &#145;curious jerky manner&#146;  (Lansdowne to Bigge, 15 July 1897, Royal Archives, W73/156) was attributed to what he himself admitted in his autobiography to be constitutional nervousness, despite his record of gallantry. He was, indeed, subject to frequent illnesses and somewhat accident-prone; his nose was once smashed by a giraffe he tried to ride at a private zoo in India.<h2>
<a name="InAfricaagain"></a>In Africa again</h2>Having failed to secure promotion, Wood was given the brigade command at Belfast on 15 December 1879 and followed this with a similar post at Chatham on 12 January 1880, which he retained until January 1881, and which was broken by escorting the Empress Eug&eacute;nie to Zululand in early 1880 to see the place where her son, the prince imperial, had been killed. Others in the party included Campbell's widow, and Wood took pains to erect suitable memorials to Campbell as well as others who had fallen at Hlobane and elsewhere. In January 1881 Wood agreed to go back to South Africa, initially only as &#145;staff colonel&#146;, to serve under Colley, to whom he was senior, against the Transvaal Boers. Given local rank as major-general, Wood pushed reinforcements up to Colley in Natal, and when Colley was killed at Majuba on 27 February, assumed command. Wood felt unable to resume the offensive until mid-March and was then directed by Gladstone's government to open negotiations. While obliged to arrange an armistice, Wood believed he would be able to defeat the Boers in renewed operations, and was condemned by many for not defying government instructions. Meanwhile Roberts was appointed to succeed Colley and, to the queen's dismay, Edward Newdigate was also named over Wood, although neither would reach South Africa before peace was concluded on 21 March 1881. In reaching agreement with the Boers, Wood had felt &#145;no discretion left to him, and that his only duty was to obey orders&#146;  (Wood to Victoria, 4 May 1881, Royal Archives, 040/144) although, when subsequently named as one of a royal commission for the settlement of the Transvaal, he did enter a dissenting opinion on boundaries and other issues. The queen was to sympathize with the unfavourable position in which Wood had been placed by governmental decisions beyond his control, but Wolseley never forgave him for not avenging Colley's death, and could not bear to have Wood near him. William Butler, who was to write Colley's biography, took a similar view.<br>
<br>Finally confirmed as major-general on 12 August 1881 and rewarded with the GCMG, Wood returned to Chatham in February 1882 after turning down the post of governor of Natal. He was selected to command the 4th brigade in Wolseley's Egyptian expedition in August 1882, but Wolseley kept him confined deliberately to occupation duties at Alexandria. After a short spell back at Chatham, he then accepted appointment as the first British sirdar (commander) of the newly reconstituted Egyptian army on 21 December 1882. Wood hoped to command the Gordon relief expedition but Wolseley was appointed in September 1884, and Wood was again sidelined by his former patron to command the expedition's lines of communication. Wolseley believed Wood too desk-bound in this role, and tension also arose between Wood and Earle, commanding the river column. However, when Stewart was fatally wounded before Methemmeh in January 1885 and Buller sent forward to take command of the desert column, Wood replaced Buller as Wolseley's chief of staff. Wood's lack of organized working methods, such as mislaying telegrams he had stuffed in his pockets, proved an irritation to Wolseley, and Buller resumed his post in March. Wood had previously decided to resign the sirdarship, and went home in June 1885.<h2>
<a name="Latercareeranddeath"></a>Later career and death</h2>Wood was appointed to the eastern district at Colchester on 1 April 1886 and, despite opposition from Cambridge, to the Aldershot command with the rank of local lieutenant-general on 1 January 1889, an arrangement necessitated by Wood being only tenth on the major-general's list. Both at Colchester and Aldershot he promoted more modern training, abolishing drill and ceremonies in favour of greater emphasis on field exercises, including night operations. He insisted, too, on better marksmanship among cavalrymen, while also promoting the cause of mounted infantry. Arguably, he proved one of the best trainers of troops in the army. He also did much to improve soldiers' conditions, supporting the reforms suggested by the Wantage commission in 1892, and later, as adjutant-general, he was to promote a series of early cinematic films to illustrate the soldier's life. Promotion to lieutenant-general came on 1 April 1890 and he received the GCB in the following year. He was considered for the chief command in India in 1892, although Henry Brackenbury believed his mind best suited to the narrower confines of Aldershot. The queen favoured Wood's appointment to India while Cambridge also favoured Wood going at least to Madras in order to enable the queen's son, the duke of Connaught, to get Aldershot. However, Wood became quartermaster-general at the War Office on 9 October 1893, reorganizing the arrangements for conveying troops overseas through new contracts with shipping companies and effecting more economical arrangements with railway companies.<br>
<br>Wood was promoted general on 26 March 1895 and on 1 October 1897 succeeded Buller as adjutant-general in the War Office, Wolseley supporting the appointment on military and public rather than personal grounds. With the changes that had taken place in the relative responsibilities of commander-in-chief and adjutant-general and their respective relationship to the secretary of state for war in 1895, Wood was now in an influential position, particularly as Wolseley and Lansdowne disliked each other and as Wolseley's health rapidly failed him. Wolseley was later to complain that he rarely saw his adjutant-general and had little knowledge of the papers that passed between Wood and Lansdowne, while, in testifying before the royal commission on the South African War, Wood indicated that he had not been privy to the intelligence reports sent to Wolseley. He also argued that he had had little responsibility for the selection of field commanders and staffs for South Africa although the adjutant-general had considerable responsibility for mobilization. Yet Wood kept himself well informed: his distrust of Kitchener, for example, leading in 1898 to the selection of Major Douglas Haig as a special service officer specifically to report to him on operations in the Sudan. When Wolseley retired in November 1900 Wood became his acting successor until Roberts returned from South Africa, circumstances Wolseley's wife feared especially detrimental to her husband's interests. Significantly, Wood supplied information to Leo Amery whose <span class="italic">Times History of the War in South Africa</span> was especially critical of the commanders in South Africa. On 1 October 1901 Wood took command of the 2nd army corps with headquarters at Salisbury. He was created field marshal on 8 April 1903 and retired on 31 December 1904. In retirement he was regimental colonel of the Royal Horse Guards in succession to Wolseley in November 1907 and also constable of the Tower of London from February 1911.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Wood was a keen rider to hounds and a leading member of the Fishmongers' Company, of which he was prime warden in 1893. He contributed regularly to military periodicals and published a number of books including <span class="italic">The Crimea in 1854 and in 1894</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Cavalry in the Waterloo Campaign</span> (1896), and <span class="italic">Achievements of Cavalry</span> (1897); he edited two volumes of <span class="italic">British Battles on Land and Sea</span> (1915) and wrote autobiographical works&#151;the two-volume <span class="italic">From Midshipman to Field Marshal</span> (1906) and <span class="italic">Winnowed Memories</span> (1918). He was a JP and, from 1897, a deputy lieutenant of Essex, but resigned from the chairmanship of the County Territorial Association in January 1914 in support of the campaign by Roberts for &#145;national service&#146;, since it was argued that the existence of the territorials prevented the introduction of compulsory service. In political terms, however, he was broadly Liberal and was approached on at least two occasions to stand for parliament in the Liberal cause, his brother, Page Wood, unsuccessfully contesting East Essex as an &#145;advanced&#146; Liberal in 1880. Wood died of heart failure at Harlow, Essex, on 2 December 1919 and was buried in Aldershot military cemetery.<br>
