<span class="headword">Todd,  Ronald <span class="st"> [Ron]</span></span>  (1927&#150;2005), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 11 March 1927 at 4 Apsley Road, Walthamstow, Essex, the fifth of six children of George Thomas Todd, builder's labourer, and later builder, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pauline. His parents were also market traders in Walthamstow market. The Todd family was a characteristic product of traditional east London cockney culture, and showed an almost tribal &eacute;lan in sustaining its claim to be among the few born within the sound of Bow bells&#151;which on a clear day in Walthamstow was just about validated.<br>
<br>The Todd family were practising Catholics and Ron Todd went to St Patrick's Roman Catholic School in Walthamstow, which he left at fourteen to get his first job sweeping the floor in a local barber's shop, after which he worked as a plumber's mate. His father, George, had been a regular in the Royal Marines and as soon as Todd was eighteen in 1945 he joined his father's regiment and for a brief spell they were actually together in the same camp. At the very end of the Second World War he was posted to Hong Kong as a marine commando and served for two years on the China border, during which time he had a spell in charge of Japanese prisoners of war. On 17 November 1945, at Our Lady's Church, Walthamstow, he married Josephine Mary Elsie (Jo) Tarrant (<i>d</i>. 1996), a nineteen-year-old factory worker, daughter of Samuel Joseph Tarrant, builder. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Todd's first job after demobilization was as a gas fitter in London's East End, but needing a better-paid job in 1954 he joined Ford Motors as an assembly line worker in the Dagenham plant, then one of the largest car plants in Europe. At the same time he also joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU)&#151;and began his long climb to the leadership of that union. He worked for eight years on the Ford production lines and within five years was voted deputy convenor for the whole Dagenham plant&#151;then with about 40,000 workers. In 1962 he became a full-time official of the TGWU&#151;in the metal, engineering, and chemical group of the union&#151;and seven years later was appointed senior regional officer which, in 1975, led to his appointment as regional secretary for the entire London and south-east area. Three years later he was promoted to the role of national organizer.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1984 Todd was elected general secretary of the TGWU to succeed Moss Evans. The union was then the largest in the country with nearly 1,500,000 members, and Todd won his election on a 41 per cent turnout of union members&#151;unusually high for any union ballot&#151;with a majority of 44,817 over his main challenger, George Wright, a Labour moderate. Wright immediately challenged Todd's victory by questioning the validity of the ballot. Moss Evans, having conducted the ballot through the independent Electoral Reform Society, repudiated the charges made by Wright and declared Todd the winner. Yet Todd refused to duck Wright's challenge and demanded a second ballot&#151;despite all efforts to dissuade him&#151;saying, &#145;I am determined that the members of this union should have the full democratic right to elect a leader whose credibility is beyond doubt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 2 May 2005). He was, of course, also sensitive to a national mood distrustful of the unions and on the whole approving of Margaret Thatcher's recent trade-union reforms. The second ballot was a triumph for Todd. The turnout, in June 1985, was again above 40 per cent and his majority over Wright increased to 76,840. It established Todd as &#145;the trade unions' Mr Honest&#146;&#151;a reputation that helped carry him through the most challenging years any trade-union leader experienced in post-war Britain.<br>
<br>Todd made no pretences to be an intellectual figure; posturing was alien to his character. Nor was he an electrifying orator. He never commanded the same attention as his illustrious predecessors such as Ernest Bevin, Frank Cousins, or Jack Jones. Yet he won enormous respect as a down-to-earth &#145;man of the people&#146; whose word was his bond&#151;qualities that certainly put him on equal terms with those earlier more famous figures. He never betrayed his working-class background, always rejected honours and baubles, and insisted on remaining plain Mr Ron Todd.<br>
<br>None of this prevented a difficult life for him on both the industrial and political fronts. Much of Todd's period as leader of the TGWU coincided with the most turbulent years in Britain's post-war industrial affairs. Margaret Thatcher's campaign to &#145;tame the unions&#146;, aided by Norman Tebbit, reached a peak during Todd's watch. In addition there was the government drive to privatize the old state industries, which led to increased unemployment and, together with new legislation curbing union powers, provoked widespread conflict, social unrest (including the year-long miners' strike), falling union membership, and a decline in the overall authority and influence of trade unionism. Todd also faced internal problems within the TGWU, notably from his thirty-nine-member executive committee, which sought a more militant political response to Thatcher's policies. One of his most emotive battles came with the government's abolition, in 1989, of the national dock labour scheme&#151;the legacy of Ernest Bevin's wartime plan to end casual dock labour when he was minister of labour in Churchill's war cabinet. Todd was prepared to call a national dock strike to fight government plans but in the end backed down when he recognized that a strike would almost certainly end in failure because of the government's new legal restrictions and, perhaps more telling, a rank-and-file fear of challenging those new powers.<br>
<br>Nor was life any easier with Todd's political allies in the Labour Party. Todd clashed fiercely with the Labour leader Neil Kinnock, especially after Labour's defeat in the general election of 1987&#151;Thatcher's third victory in succession. It was after that defeat that Kinnock set about reforming Labour policies, notably discarding the party's policy on nuclear disarmament, and effectively laying the basis for what was to become Tony Blair's &#145;new&#146; Labour Party. This provoked major conflict between Kinnock and Todd, starting at the Labour Party conference of 1988 and continuing until they both left the scene after the election of 1992. The primary cause was Kinnock's abandonment of unilateral nuclear disarmament. Todd denounced this as a betrayal, recalling how his predecessor Frank Cousins had started the party on the road to nuclear disarmament in 1960 by defeating the then Labour leader, Hugh Gaitksell. But in addition to this Todd objected to Kinnock's arguments in favour of &#145;modernizing&#146; the Labour Party to increase its electoral appeal. What was particularly surprising at the time was that Todd's criticism of Kinnock was resented even by many of his friends on the left, not least because his strident and inflexible views seemed uncharacteristic&#151;especially since Kinnock was a long-standing member of the TGWU. The truth is that there was an almost chemical lack of rapport between the two men: Kinnock had become impatient with what he, and others, were persuaded was a failure among the trade-union leadership to recognize changing social and political mores. On Todd's side there was a deepening fear that Labour's historic mission was being abandoned in favour of populism. It was a breach between Labour leadership and trade unions never to be resolved and that continued into and through the Blair era, long after Todd had departed the scene.<br>
<br>In many ways Todd was a most unusual trade-union &#145;baron&#146;. He was a committed patriot&#151;his friendship with the queen mother and his stance as an unapologetic royalist enabled him to recruit her as an honorary member of the TGWU. He was also a man who cherished his service in the Royal Marines, always attending their annual reunions. Yet none of this detracted from Todd's holding firmly to his socialist convictions&#151;and possibly an even greater paradox, to his commitment to nuclear disarmament.<br>
<br>It was Todd's warmly effusive and generous cockney character quite as much as his ardent socialism and trade unionism that combined to establish him in the public eye as one of the most popular of all trade-union leaders during the most testing period for post-war trade unionism. Todd possessed a very British quality of presenting a face of humour amid considerable turbulence. It was, indeed, that character of patient courage that helped sustain him during a period of tremendous pressures and political tensions in his seven years as leader of the largest trade union in the country. Being elected general secretary of the TGWU in those days was akin to joining the royal household of Britain's labour movement. It was an inheritance Todd fought to sustain with humility, humanity, palpable integrity, and dedication&#151;and always against the tide as Margaret Thatcher's policy to curb trade-union influence bit deeply into the nation's industrial life.<br>
<br>Todd served as a TUC member of the National Economic Development Committee (1985&#150;92), a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal (1986&#150;9, and president for most of that time), honorary vice-president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a patron of the Margaret Centre Macmillan Appeal, TUC representative on various anti-apartheid committees, and chairman of Trade Unions for Labour Victory, which successfully organized the retention of the Labour Party political levy among trade unionists following the <span class="roman">Trade Union Act</span> of 1984. He played a leading role in the trade-union campaign against apartheid in South Africa and in preparing for Nelson Mandela's release from prison, remaining a close friend of Mandela thereafter. He was also powerfully influential in paving the way for his successor, Bill Morris, to become the first black leader of any British trade union&#151;indeed the first black man to head any major British institution. He retired as TGWU general secretary in the spring of 1992 and a few months later from the TUC general council, on which he had served since 1984, and of whose international committee he was chairman.<br>
<br>In retirement Todd spent much time on his long-standing hobby, palaeontology. He had a collection of 300 fossils, which evoked the nickname from his critics of Toddosaurus, to which he would respond with the quip, &#145;Don't knock the dinosaurs&#151;they ruled the earth for 200 million years&#146;  (private information). He also collected Victorian songbooks and in retirement took a course in sign language to help the deaf and dumb. Even more unusually for a trade-union leader he wrote poetry and published five booklets of poems. He died of acute myeloblastic leukaemia on 30 April 2005 at Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, Essex. He was survived by his three children.<br>
