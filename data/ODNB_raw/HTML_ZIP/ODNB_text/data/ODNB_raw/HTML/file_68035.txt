<span class="headword">Coningsby,  Humfrey</span>  (1567&#150;1610/11), <span class="occ">collector of poems and traveller</span>, was born about February 1567, probably at Neen Sollars, Shropshire, the only son of John Coningsby and his wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas Barnaby of Bockelton, Worcestershire. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, after 27 November 1581, aged fifteen. He was related to Thomas Coningsby (1550&#150;1625) of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, whose wife, Philippa, was the daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam and his wife, Anne, sister of Sir Henry Sidney. Thomas Coningsby accompanied Philip Sidney on his European tour in 1573. In 1604 Sir Thomas Coningsby sent letters to Robert Sidney, Lord Sidney, &#145;by my cousin Humfrey Coningesby&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 3.99).<br>
<br>Humfrey Coningsby was the owner and compiler of an important Elizabethan poetical miscellany  (BL, Harleian MS 7392 (2)). It consists of a collection of courtly poems by writers such as Queen Elizabeth, Edward Dyer, Arthur Gorges, the earl of Oxford, Walter Ralegh, and Philip Sidney, as well as pieces printed in <span class="italic">The Paradyse of Dynasty Devises</span> (1576), some topical poems, and a large number of poems which appear to be unique to the manuscript. Coningsby's name and signature occur several times in the manuscript: many of the poems have his initials or H. Con. written after them, while other ascriptions indicate some concern with the correct attribution of their authorship. At Oxford, <i>c</i>.1581&#150;1583, and at the inns of court in London in 1584, the manuscript circulated among his friends who included the antiquary St Loe Kniveton (<i>d</i>. 1628), Edward Evans, and Richard Allott, the compiler of <span class="italic">Englands Parnassus</span>. Thomas Coningsby may have been the source for the courtly poems in his cousin's miscellany.<br>
<br>Humfrey Coningsby was a traveller who left England in April 1594 and during the next four or more years visited much of Europe, including France, Germany, Sicily, and Italy. A second journey took him to Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary where he served under the emperor Rudolph II at the siege of Strigonium. He then went on to Greece, into Asia, and stayed for thirteen months in Turkey. After he returned to England, his next visit was to Spain. He set off, finally, from London on 10 October 1610 for Venice, was never heard of again, and was pronounced dead in 1611. In his will made on 10 November 1608 he left his books, his best lute, and his pictures to Thomas: other bequests included &#145;a white hower glasse of sea horse toothe&#146; and &#145;Three greate Venetian lookinge glasses&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/148). His fine tomb in the church at Neen Sollars was set up in 1624 by his half-sister Joyce Jefferies; its inscription supplies most of what is known of his life. He was unmarried: his heir was his sister, Catherine, who married Edward Freeman of Evenlode, Worcester.<br>
