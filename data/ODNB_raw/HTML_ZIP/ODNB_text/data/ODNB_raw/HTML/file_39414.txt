<span class="headword">Chapman,  Herbert</span>  (1878&#150;1934), <span class="occ">football manager</span>, was born on 19 January 1878 at 17 Kiveton Wales, Kiveton Park, Yorkshire, a small mining village between Worksop and Sheffield. His father, John, was a coalminer who with his wife, Emma Haynes, had five other sons and one daughter. Chapman went to the local elementary school and with his brothers became an enthusiastic footballer when it was all the rage in the 1890s. On leaving school he was apprenticed at the local colliery and began a course in mining engineering at Sheffield Technical College. The Sheffield area was a hotbed of football and Chapman played for several local clubs while he was in his teens. But in 1897 he signed for Stalybridge Rovers in the Lancashire league and began a very mobile period in his life in which it was not clear whether he was looking for work or looking for football. While still an amateur&#151;at work by day and, allegedly, studying at night&#151;he played for Rochdale, Grimsby Town, Swindon Town, Sheppey United, and Worksop Town, all by 1900.<br>
<br>Chapman was not a great player, but obviously a useful one. He was on the small side and, though sturdily built, had a tendency to put on weight; this had the disadvantage of slowing him down but meant he was not easy, in a physical sport, to knock off the ball. His brother Harry was much more skilful, and became a professional with Sheffield Wednesday and a regular goalscorer in the team which won two first division titles between 1902 and 1904. Perhaps this success influenced Herbert, because in 1901 he signed professional forms with Northampton Town of the southern league.<br>
<br>But Chapman did not stay there long; he played briefly for Sheffield United in 1902, Notts County in 1903, had returned to Northampton in 1904, and in March 1905 was transferred to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of &pound;70. This brought some stability&#151;he actually stayed for two years&#151;but more important in this respect was his marriage, in the same year (12 September 1905), to Annie Bennett Poxon (<i>b</i>. 1880/81), the daughter of John Poxon, colliery manager. She was an elementary school teacher whom he had met in Kiveton. The couple lived in north London, and Mrs Chapman was a supply teacher at the Silver Street School in Edmonton, where she survived by only one vote after the local education committee had debated whether, as a married woman, she should be allowed to continue in post. In 1908 their first child, Kenneth, was born; he was later followed by Joyce, Molly, and Bruce. Chapman was fond of his family and, when asked by a journalist what had been his proudest moment, replied that it was when his son had qualified as a solicitor.<br>
<br>Chapman's playing career could hardly be said to have been planned (at the time of his marriage he still described his profession as &#145;colliery manager&#146;), and his first step in football management must also have been a surprise. Northampton Town had asked several players and former players before offering him the job in 1907. Northampton was a rugby town in a soccer county and with the team bottom of the league the club was losing money as gates declined. Chapman turned the club round to such effect that by Christmas 1908 it was top of the southern league and eventually won the championship with a record number of wins, points, and goals. Chapman stayed at Northampton for five years, building a reputation as a shrewd man-manager and tactician until he was offered the secretary&#150;managership of Leeds City in May 1912. The West Riding of Yorkshire was another rugby stronghold with soccer, rugby, and the northern union game all competing for middle-class pounds and working-class pence. Again Chapman revived an ailing club in two years, taking them from bottom of the second division to their highest-ever position of fourth. But his reputation was tarnished by his role in a case of illegal payments to players. On the one hand it was largely a technical offence and on the other it was Chapman who persuaded his directors to ask for an inquiry, but he was still fined and censured.<br>
<br>With football on a war footing from 1915 Chapman was only part-time at Leeds City and from 1916 full-time at a munitions factory at Barnbow, near Leeds. With the war over, he surprisingly resigned from the Leeds City job to go into full-time management at the Olympia oil and cake mills in Selby of Joseph Watson &amp; Son. Barely six months later another joint Football Association (FA) and Football League commission was set up to investigate allegations of illegal payments to Leeds City players during the war. The inquiry did not travel far down the road to justice because the club's directors refused to produce the books. As a result, the club became the first to be expelled from the league. Chapman and five others were banned from football management. Chapman looked to have no future in football and his prospects deteriorated further with the closure of the Olympia mills. But early in 1921 he was approached by the directors of Huddersfield Town to become the assistant of their manager, Ambrose Langley. The FA allowed itself to be persuaded that he had not been guilty at Leeds, or&#151;as there were no books&#151;guilt could not be proved. Perhaps his honesty of 1912 helped. Only one month after he went to Huddersfield, Langley and his trainer resigned and Chapman took over. Huddersfield was also a stronghold of rugby, but Chapman quickly built a successful side, which won the cup in 1922, finished third in the league in 1922&#150;3, and the following season won an exciting title race on the last day of the season on goal average from Cardiff City. The next season, 1924&#150;5, Huddersfield won the championship again and their reserves won the central league. There was general agreement among press and public that Chapman was the brains behind the team, a Napoleon of football.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1925 Arsenal advertised for a team manager, insisting that &#145;Gentlemen whose sole ability to build up a good side depends on the payment of heavy and exorbitant transfer fees need not apply&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athletic News</span>, 11 May 1925). But Arsenal were struggling in the first division and Chapman quickly charmed and persuaded their dictatorial chairman, Sir Henry Norris, to revise his ideas on transfers, most spectacularly by signing the experienced forward Charlie Buchan from Sunderland. However, the Norris&#150;Chapman partnership was not long-lasting as Norris was found guilty of financial irregularities and forced to resign in 1927. He later claimed that Chapman knew about the compensation paid to Buchan on his transfer for the loss of his sports shop in Sunderland and sued the FA. Chapman denied it and the court upheld the FA's verdict. At Arsenal, Chapman built a new team for a new era, though it took four years to secure the right players. A second place and a cup final defeat were followed by victory at Wembley in 1930 against his old team Huddersfield, both a sign of and a prelude to the triumphs to follow. Chapman may not have invented the &#145;WM&#146; formation nor the centre-half as third back, but the Arsenal team which he constructed adapted best to the liberalization of the offside law. In five years from 1930 Arsenal won four league titles, including three in succession (to equal Huddersfield's record), and in the other year, 1931&#150;2, finished runners-up in both league and cup. These were the years which confirmed Herbert Chapman's reputation as the first and greatest modern football manager.<br>
<br>Chapman believed in tactical planning, at a time when it was not very common in English football. He sought intelligent players who could contribute to both the devising and the application of attractive methods. He also valued enthusiasm and a willingness to adapt to change. Early on in his career he realized that a team could attack too much, provoking the opposition to pack their defence and thus making scoring difficult. Chapman wanted a team that could switch quickly from solid defence to devastating attack and he built one at Arsenal in the early 1930s. Arsenal could soak up pressure but then win with breakaway goals. Polite critics called them lucky, but it was thoughtful efficiency applied to football.<br>
<br>Chapman's own experience taught him that players should be treated with more consideration. He improved dressing-room and training facilities and under Tom Whittaker built an up-to-the-minute medical centre often used by other sportsmen. He pioneered golf as an aid to relaxation and a savings scheme to help young men manage their money, and he introduced team talks designed to boost self-confidence among the players. He emphasized the importance to the club of the reserves, and stressed the value of team spirit as well as planning for the future. At Arsenal he achieved a symbiotic snugness between players and system. His was a human approach to football management, which attempted to strike the right balance between encouragement and discipline. In many respects he liked players similar to himself, clever but with careful and sober lifestyles. He could find the more flamboyant difficult to handle. He was fond of applying the happy family metaphor to football and stressed the importance of directors, officials, and players all pulling together. The phrase &#145;benevolent dictator&#146; comes to mind. On the other hand, he seems to have been a good listener, especially to the more reflective footballer.<br>
<br>Chapman certainly embraced football modernity; his broadcasts and journalism were full of ideas about the future development of the football business. He was in favour of floodlights, of numbering players' shirts, and of making Arsenal stadium more attractive for spectators. One of his shrewdest moves was to persuade the London Electric Railway in 1932 to change the name of their Piccadilly Line station adjacent to Highbury from the mundane Gillespie Road to the charismatic Arsenal. He was among the first to recognize the growing threat of European football to British superiority. He thought the size of the selection committee of the England team should be reduced from twelve to three. He had a European-wide reputation and looked forward to a European nations' championship.<br>
<br>Herbert Chapman was a workaholic who was never satisfied. As secretary&#150;manager of Arsenal he had wide responsibilities, and not only on the playing side. No member of staff was permitted to leave until he or she had phoned Chapman's office at six o'clock and asked if it was all right to go. It was this commitment which led to his death when a cold turned to pneumonia and he died suddenly at his home, 6 Haslemere Avenue, Hendon, Middlesex, on 6 January 1934, after watching Arsenal reserves at Guildford. He was buried four days later at St Mary's, Hendon. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Great success is easily turned into myth, especially in football. Arsenal's victories were not all magically pre-planned, and if the system worked it was Chapman's intelligent choice of player that made it do so. Other clubs repaid Arsenal by imitating their method but did not replicate their success. Moreover, Arsenal had large resources and Chapman was ruthless in the exploitation of them. But his achievements proved enduring and the bust by Jacob Epstein commissioned by a dozen of his friends has been a constant reminder. Between 1936 and 2006 Epstein's bust stood in the main entrance to the east stand at Highbury, and it was then moved to the entrance hall of Arsenal's new Emirates stadium. No wonder that in later less successful times, when beset by footballing difficulties, chairman Denis Hill-Wood would say to secretary Bob Wall &#145;What would Herbert Chapman have done?&#146;  (Studd, 138).<br>
