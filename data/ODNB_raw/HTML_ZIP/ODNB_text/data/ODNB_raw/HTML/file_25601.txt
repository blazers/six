<span class="headword">Simson,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1526&#150;1591?), <span class="occ">grammarian and Church of Scotland minister</span>, studied at King's College, Aberdeen, probably under the humanist John Vaus and certainly under his assistant and successor Theophilus Stewart. By late May 1550 he was master of the grammar school at Perth, where he was admitted as a burgess and brother of the guild. It is unclear whether he was the man of that name who studied at St Salvator's College, St Andrews, in 1554, and at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1559. By the mid-1550s Simson had married Violet Adamson (also known as Constyne or Constant), daughter of a Perth baker and sister of Patrick Adamson, the future archbishop of St Andrews (1575&#150;92). They had seven sons (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25605/', "Patrick Simson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25608/', "William Simson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25603/', "Archibald Simson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25600/', "Alexander Simson")</script>, Richard, Abraham, and Matthew) and three daughters (Katherine, Violet, and a third, whose name is unknown). A very popular master, Simson taught as many as 300 students at a time, including sons of prominent nobles and gentry. Although normally a stern teacher who was willing to use a leather strap on the students, he sometimes permitted his charges to play games.<br>
<br>Before his conversion Simson is said by John Row to have been &#145;a zealous papist&#146;  (Row, 1.4), but he became a protestant after reading a book by Sir David Lindsay, probably <span class="italic">Ane Dialog Betuix Experience and ane Courteour</span> (1553), at the request of one of his students. Simson continued to teach at Perth until 1560, and about 1562 became minister of Dunning, Perth, with responsibility as well for Cargill. On 28 June 1564 the general assembly approved his transfer to Dunbar, where he was also responsible for some of the surrounding districts and taught in the town's grammar school. On 31 August 1568 the government formally presented Simson with the parsonage at Dunbar, where his stipend was &pound;126 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in 1574. In the meantime, on 4 September 1566 he was a signatory of a letter to Theodore Beza approving the second Helvetic confession, with the exception of the provisions recognizing the holy days associated with Christ's life. In 1570 he persuaded a fellow minister, John Kello of Spott, Haddingtonshire, to confess that he had murdered his wife, and seven years later he reportedly prophesied disaster when he saw a thousand fishing boats casting nets on the sabbath: that night 170 boats were said to have capsized in a storm.<br>
<br>In August 1572 the general assembly appointed Simson to the committee responsible for reviewing the visitation records of the archbishop of St Andrews, the superintendents, and the commissioners. Two months later he subscribed the articles of the synod of Lothian, which dealt with administrative matters, the importance of the nobility's participation in general assemblies, and the provision of books to clergy with low stipends. In March 1574 the assembly appointed him to a committee that handled requests and complaints which synods could not settle.<br>
<br>In December 1575 Regent Morton and the privy council named Simson to a committee of grammarians, chaired by George Buchanan and Peter Young, the royal preceptors, whose primary goal was to fashion a national grammar; Simson's task was the preparation of the first and second rudiments. By 1580 he had completed the <span class="italic">Rudimenta grammatices in gratiam juventutis Scoticae conscripta</span>, which Christophe Plantin published in Antwerp; no copy of this edition is known to have survived. An edition was published at Edinburgh in 1587. Meanwhile Simson resigned as minister at Dunbar before 11 September 1580, perhaps to devote more time to his writing. About October 1582, however, he accepted a position as minister at Dalkeith, with responsibility for the parishes of Lasswade and Glencorse as well. During these years he undoubtedly continued to work on the &#145;Second rudiments&#146;, though this was never published during his lifetime. Indeed, the first recorded licence to print Simson's <span class="italic">Rudimenta</span> dates only from 1599, but the work was being used as a textbook in Edinburgh two years earlier. One early edition (published in 1597) combined Simson's &#145;First rudiments&#146; with the &#145;Second rudiments&#146; from Andrew Duncan's <span class="italic">Studiorum puerilium clavis</span> (<span class="italic">Key to the Studies of Boys</span>).<br>
<br>Simson successfully opposed the attempt of the Stirling minister Robert Montgomery, a favourite of the duke of Lennox, to become bishop of Glasgow, attacking him from the pulpit as unfit for the post. In the autumn of 1584 he refused to sign a bond recognizing the crown's spiritual jurisdiction, and he was consequently summoned to appear before James VI and the privy council on 7 December. Rather than subscribe to the official formula Simson was permitted to devise his own words, swearing not to preach heresy or sedition, nor to incite subjects to rebel, and to obey all laws as long as they agreed with the word of God. For unknown reasons his stipend was given to the abbey of Newbattle in 1587, but it was apparently restored to him in 1589. Simson probably died in early 1591. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25603/', "Archibald Simson (1564&#150;1628)")</script>, who had been his assistant at Dalkeith since 1586, was ordained as its minister on 3 June 1591. Altogether six of Simson's sons became ministers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25605/', "Patrick Simson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25608/', "William Simson")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25600/', "Alexander Simson")</script>; the seventh, Matthew, was a professor of humanity at Glasgow University. In February 1586 his daughter Katherine married Alexander Home, minister of Dunbar (where he succeeded Simson), and his daughter Violet married James Carmichael, minister of Haddington and rector of its grammar school from 1572 to 1576.<br>
