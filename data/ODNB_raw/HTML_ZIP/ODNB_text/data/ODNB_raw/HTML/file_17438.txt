<span class="headword">Macdonald,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1741), <span class="occ">domestic servant and memoirist</span>, was born in the parish of Urquhart, Inverness-shire, the son of a gentleman cattle dealer whose wife, from a Mackay family, died two years after Macdonald's birth. Macdonald's father fought with the Jacobite highlanders and was killed at the battle of Culloden in 1746. The orphaned John and his two small brothers, led by their fourteen-year-old sister, Kitty, and her &#145;heroic disposition&#146;  (Macdonald, 5), then walked 150 miles to Edinburgh within two months. There they found various positions in service, and Macdonald at the age of nine became the &#145;littlest postilion in Scotland or any other country&#146;  (ibid., 18). He was also taught to read by his employers. After Edinburgh he took up employment with various Jacobite families in Scotland. In the early 1760s he travelled around Ireland with a new master, and finished up in London in 1763.<br>
<br>In London Macdonald joined the household of John Crauford of Errol, &#145;just come from Paris, one of the gayest young gentlemen and the greatest gambler that ever belonged to Scotland&#146;  (Macdonald, 82). With Crauford, Macdonald travelled around the continent, although he advised his master that the British Isles offered a richer source of amusement and instruction. Crauford was an acquaintance of Laurence Sterne, and is thought to have told him the story which Sterne transformed into the final chapter of <span class="italic">A Sentimental Journey</span>, &#145;The case of delicacy&#146;. Back in London in 1768 Macdonald was sent by Crauford to enquire after the bedridden Sterne's health, and in fact witnessed the novelist's death.<br>
<br>In 1769 Macdonald sailed to India with his new master, Alexander Dow, the close friend of James Macpherson and author of several accounts of Indian history. They seem to have spent several years in India and Macdonald's observations on Indian manners and customs are frank and tolerant. Following his return to Europe Macdonald, whose talents at dressing hair made him extremely desirable, continued to travel around Europe as valet to a variety of gentlemen, including Macpherson and James Coutts the banker. In London again, in 1778 Macdonald courted ridicule by sporting a new French accessory in the streets: nevertheless, the umbrella soon became &#145;a great trade in London&#146;  (Macdonald, 236).<br>
<br>Macdonald himself returned to Toledo in Spain in the summer of 1778 to discover that a night of passion he had enjoyed with a certain Malilia the previous year had produced a son, John England. Thereafter he and Malilia married and settled in Toledo, and he found a job at the H&ocirc;tel de Naples  (Macdonald, 249) and wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1790 as <span class="italic">Travels, in Various Parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa</span>. They not only provide all the biographical evidence available on Macdonald's own colourful life, but paint a vivid picture of the European beau monde, and indeed the Indian subcontinent, from the unusual perspective of a servant. His observations offer a wry commentary on aristocratic travelling habits. His own amorous exploits with servant girls (which may account for his frequent changes of employer) feature prominently in the <span class="italic">Travels</span>, to the disapproval of contemporary reviewers, one of whom expressed anxiety that the publication would only &#145;increase the assurance of footmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Analytical Review</span>, 8.63). Macdonald's date and place of death are unknown.<br>
