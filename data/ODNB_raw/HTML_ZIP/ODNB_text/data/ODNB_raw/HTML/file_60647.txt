<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Daley,  Harry</span>  (1901&#150;1971), <span class="occ">police officer and author</span>, was born at 49 Stevens Street, Lowestoft, Suffolk, on 14 November 1901, the second son and fourth of the five children of Joseph Daley (<i>d</i>. 1911), skipper of a fishing smack, and his wife, Emily Firman, a former parlourmaid. He was educated from the age of three at the local school and, despite considerable financial hardship and the long absences at sea of his bawdy, easy-going, and adored father, his childhood was exceptionally happy. In the great &#145;September gale&#146; of 1911, however, Joseph Daley was one of the many fishermen lost at sea. Instead of going on to secondary school, Harry gave up his education to become a telegram boy. During the First World War, Zeppelin raids and rumours of a German invasion decided Daley's mother to move the family to the relative safety of Dorking, Surrey, where her eldest daughter was living. Here Daley got a job with a grocer, driving a pony and trap round the countryside collecting orders for goods.<br>
<br>Daley was avid for culture and began buying the sort of eclectic volumes sold cheaply from the boxes that stood outside booksellers' shops. Weekends were spent visiting London to explore theatres, cinemas, galleries, and concert halls. At the age of twenty-four he decided, almost on a whim, to join the Metropolitan Police force. He was not the most likely recruit, since he was inclined to plumpness and described himself as &#145;well below average plain common sense; sexually both innocent and deplorable; honourable if not exactly honest; trusting; truthful; romantic and sentimental to the point of sloppiness&#146;  (Daley, <span class="italic">This Small Cloud</span>, 78). The selection committee nevertheless judged him &#145;a good type of chap&#151;just what we want&#146;, and he began training at Peel House in March 1925  (ibid., 77). Having passed his examinations, he was posted to &#145;T&#146; division, based in Hammersmith, west London. His first beat was in Chiswick, but after a few months he was transferred to Hammersmith itself, a lively part of the capital where the police lived in comparative harmony with petty criminals, their relationship eased by small bribes. Daley, who was homosexual, and took no great pains to hide the fact, found himself attracted to the sharply dressed and cheeky young crooks who thronged the streets, and soon numbered several of them among his friends and lovers. When he was obliged to make arrests, most of these young men philosophically accepted it as a &#145;fair cop&#146; and struck dramatic poses when their captor, a keen amateur photographer, snapped them as they were loaded into Black Marias.<br>
<br>It was while on his Hammersmith beat in 1925 that Daley met J. R. Ackerley, a local resident whose pioneering play about homosexuality, <span class="italic">The Prisoners of War</span>, then running in London, had impressed him. The two men struck up a conversation, probably had a brief sexual relationship, and became lifelong friends. Ackerley introduced Daley to E. M. Forster, with whom he embarked on an important but troubled love affair. Although Forster was delighted to accompany Daley on his beat and be introduced to his working-class associates, he was appalled by the policeman's recklessness and constitutional lack of discretion&#151;Daley described &#145;safety first&#146; as a &#145;contemptible slogan&#146;  (Daley, <span class="italic">This Small Cloud</span>, 6). The relationship foundered in 1932, but it had given Daley an entr&eacute;e into the literary world, where he was painted by Duncan Grant and entertained people with his stories. Recognizing a skilled raconteur, Ackerley, then working as an assistant talks producer at the BBC, persuaded Daley to make some radio broadcasts about his life. &#145;Not a happy one?&#146; was broadcast on the Home Service on 25 March 1929 and subsequently published in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, as were several other talks on the police, his Lowestoft childhood, and other subjects. Daley sometimes spoke as an official representative of the Metropolitan Police, but it was thought politic for other talks, such as an enthusiastic account of criminal activity at London street markets, to be broadcast and published under the pseudonyms of Joe Daley and Harry Firman.<br>
<br>In 1935 Daley was transferred to Vine Street, but he preferred the suburbs to Soho, and was much happier when he was sent to Wandsworth early in the Second World War. &#145;Wandsworth was full of lively, good-looking people who thought nothing of telling a policeman to get stuffed&#146;, he recalled. &#145;It was a marvellous place and I couldn't see myself making many arrests&#146;  (Daley, <span class="italic">This Small Cloud</span>, 183). After the war he reluctantly took a temporary staff job, running a police recruitment centre in Beak Street, but he longed to get back to the streets. On 21 May 1950 he left the police to join the merchant navy as a master-at-arms. He was forty-nine. His new career was cut short by the onset of diabetes, which led to periods of depression. In 1957 he retired to Dorking, living at 78 Pixham Lane with his younger brother David.<br>
<br>During the 1940s Daley had tried writing short stories, and submitted them to Ackerley, who had become the literary editor of <span class="italic">The Listener</span>. None was ever published, partly because they were, characteristically, &#145;rather near the knuckle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 63). After his retirement, on Ackerley's advice, Daley began writing a book of reminiscences. This was partly a therapeutic exercise: he had always been quick to take offence, even when none was intended, but as he wrote the book, he realized that he had in fact had a generally happy and fortunate life. <span class="italic">This Small Cloud</span>&#151;the title refers to his homosexuality&#151;was highly indiscreet about his own life and work, but he did not mention any of the famous people with whom he had been involved. This remarkable book is not only funny, touching, and self-deprecatory, but is an important social document. It was published posthumously in 1987, with an afterword by Clive Emsley, historian of the police. It was the only piece of writing that Daley did not destroy before his death, which occurred at Dorking General Hospital on 12 March 1971 as a result of his diabetes. Following cremation at Surrey and Sussex crematorium, Worth, his ashes were scattered at Box Hill, Surrey.<br>
