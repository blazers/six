<span class="headword">Cockerell, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (1755&#150;1837), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born at Bishops Hull, Somerset, on 18 February 1755, the fifth son of John Cockerell (1714&#150;1767), of Welsh descent, with interests in the West Indies, and of his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1769), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson, a descendant of Samuel Pepys, the diarist. Charles had four sisters; one of his brothers was the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5783/', "Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1753&#150;1827)")</script>. After two years at Winchester College and a course of accounts and bookkeeping at a school in Bromley by Bow, Middlesex, in 1776 he followed his eldest brother, John (<i>d</i>. 1798), who had been commissioned into the East India Company's army, to Bengal as a writer in the company's civil service. With an interval of leave, Cockerell was to remain in India until 1801.<br>
<br>Nearly all Charles Cockerell's Indian service was spent in Calcutta, where his most important appointment was as the company's postmaster-general from 1784 until 1792. Thereafter he remained a servant of the company, but without official employment, while he devoted his time to transacting his own private business as a partner in what was called a &#145;house of agency&#146;. Houses of agency were a relatively new development in British India. They handled the concerns of Europeans in India, acting as their agents for their business dealings, arranging remittances to Britain, and financing shipping, plantations, and other private enterprises.<br>
<br>In 1784 Cockerell became a partner in the agency house established by William Paxton (1744&#150;1824). When Paxton went to London to extend their business there, Cockerell managed the Calcutta house, which as Paxton and Cockerell, later Paxton, Cockerell, and Trail, became the most successful agency concern of its time. Although one of his contemporaries doubted whether Cockerell had &#145;a heart that could raise a thermometer above the freezing point&#146;  (J. P. Wade to F. Fowke, 1 Feb 1789, BL OIOC, MS Eur. E 8, fols. 169&#150;70), he seems to have been a popular as well as a conspicuous figure in Calcutta society. His brief first marriage, on 11 March 1789, was to Maria Tryphena Blunt (<i>d</i>. 1789), daughter of Sir Charles William Blunt, third baronet (1731&#150;1802), of the East India Company's service. She died that October. Their marriage was commemorated by an opulent painting of the couple at a harpsichord by Francesco Renaldi (1755&#150;<i>c.</i>1799). Cockerell was churchwarden of the new St John's Church in Calcutta.<br>
<br>In 1801 Cockerell moved to Britain. He became a partner in the London house of Paxton, Cockerell, and Trail (later Cockerell and Trail, and Cockerell &amp; Co.), first in the Strand, then in Pall Mall and finally at Austin Friars in the City. The firm continued to transact Indian agency business, as well as banking for British clients. Cockerell's interests spread very widely beyond the bank. He became a director of the Globe Insurance Company, the Arkendale and Derwent Mining Company, and the Gas, Light, and Coke Company. No doubt a wealthy man when he left India, his fortune at his death was assessed at &pound;140,000. Cockerell entered parliament as MP for Tregony in Cornwall in 1802 and, with an interval of two years, was to remain an MP, representing a number of constituencies, for the rest of his life. He identified himself politically with the former governor-general, Richard, Marquess Wellesley, to whom he appears to have advanced large sums of money. Through Wellesley's influence Cockerell was made a baronet in 1809.<br>
<br>Cockerell maintained a large London house at Hyde Park Corner, but he also set himself up as a landowner in Gloucestershire. He bought Sezincote from the estate of his late brother John and instructed his architect brother, Samuel Pepys Cockerell, to convert it to a house in the Mughal taste. Samuel was aided by Humphry Repton and the artist Thomas Daniell, who had travelled in India, painted many buildings there, and could therefore check the designs for authenticity. Work was begun in 1806 or 1807 and continued into the 1820s: a pastiche of the Taj Mahal, and &#145;Hindoo&#146; motifs were included in the house and its outbuildings. The result was probably the most ambitious attempt up to that time to reproduce Indian architecture in Britain.<br>
<br>On 13 February 1808 Cockerell married for the second time. His new wife, with whom he had a son and two daughters, was the Hon. Harriet Rushout (<i>d</i>. 1851), second daughter of John Rushout, first Baron Northwick (1738&#150;1800). Through his brother-in-law's family interest Cockerell represented the borough of Evesham from 1819 until his death. Cockerell lived in London and at Sezincote in some state. He entertained lavishly. Warren Hastings, his near neighbour, was a frequent guest. The Indian traveller Mirza Abu Talib, who was once entertained by Cockerell with 700 other diners, paid tribute to his generosity: &#145;Had he been my brother, he could not have behaved with more kindness&#146;  (Head, 31). From 1835 to 1837 Cockerell was one of the commissioners of the Board of Control for India. He died at Sezincote on 6 January 1837, just before his eighty-second birthday. His title passed to his son, Charles Rushout Cockerell (1809&#150;1869), who changed his name to Rushout in 1849.<br>
