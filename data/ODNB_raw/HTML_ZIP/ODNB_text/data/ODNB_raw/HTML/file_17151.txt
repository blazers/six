<span class="headword">Lucy, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1532, <em>d.</em> 1600), <span class="occ">gentleman</span>, of Charlecote, in Warwickshire, was the eldest son of William Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1551) and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1550), daughter of Richard Fermor of Easton Neston in Northamptonshire. The family could trace its tenure of Charlecote back at least to the end of the twelfth century, when the village was recorded in the possession of Walter, son of Thurstan of Charlecote. Walter's son and heir, William, assumed the surname Lucy, possibly that of the family of his mother, Cecilia. Over the next three hundred years the family estate descended from father to son, augmented from time to time by advantageous marriages, particularly that of Thomas Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1415) to Alice Hugford, heir to extensive estates in Bedfordshire and Shropshire.<br>
<br>Thomas Lucy was educated at home, at one time by John Fawkener, an Oxford graduate, and then, for a year or so between the summer of 1545 and early in 1547, by John Foxe, the martyrologist. During this period Thomas, still only fourteen or so, was betrothed to Joyce (1532&#150;1596), the twelve-year-old only child and heir of Thomas Acton of Sutton Park, in Worcestershire. Their marriage settlement is dated 1 August 1546, the marriage itself presumably taking place shortly afterwards. Five months later, in January 1547, Acton died, and his extensive estates, subject only to his wife's dowry, were thus inherited by his daughter. In 1551 Thomas Lucy inherited Charlecote itself on the death of his father, William, and, in 1553, having reached the age of twenty-one, was granted admission to his estates. Within a few years he began rebuilding the family home at Charlecote, which was completed, according to William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</span>, in 1559/60. It was an imposing brick building, half-H in plan, with a detached gatehouse. Despite major renovation and improvement during the first half of the nineteenth century, the building still retains these original features. At the same time Lucy was building up his Warwickshire estates. In 1553 he acquired from the crown the nearby manor of Sherbourne by exchanging for it land in Bedfordshire, and four years later was granted by Queen Mary the reversion of the adjacent manor of Hampton Lucy. For the next ten years or so there is further evidence of his selling off his more distant estates, especially those in Bedfordshire that had formed part of his wife's inheritance. This policy was facilitated by the death, in 1564, of his mother-in-law, which had freed the estates from dower.<br>
<br>From 1559 Lucy entered on the life of public service to be expected of a man in his position. He sat as a member of parliament for Warwickshire in 1559, 1571, and 1584, was sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire in 1559/60, of Warwickshire in 1578/9, and of Worcestershire in 1585/6, and served as a justice of the peace in Warwickshire from <i>c</i>.1559 and in Worcestershire from <i>c</i>.1582. He was knighted in 1565, and entertained Elizabeth I at his house at Charlecote during her visit to nearby Kenilworth in August 1572. In 1590 he was appointed a member of the council in the marches of Wales.<br>
<br>In his religious views Lucy was clearly a vigorous protestant. This is best illustrated in the contributions he made to parliamentary business, particularly in the parliaments of 1571 and 1584. In the former he was appointed to a committee concerned with defects in the prayer book, and was involved in legislation against the practice of Catholic priests' disguising themselves in serving-men's apparel, and to enforce church attendance and the taking of communion. In the 1584 parliament he introduced one of the petitions concerning godly preachers, and took a leading role in pressing for more stringent punishment for the Welsh lawyer William Parry, who had spoken out against anti-Catholic legislation. Locally he was concerned with the prosecution of recusants, and in 1583 was closely involved in the arrest of Edward Arden and other Catholic families after the uncovering of the so-called Somerville conspiracy. However, it would be unwise to argue from this that Lucy was a representative of the puritan interest. His record differed little from that of other local gentry entrusted with the implementation of government policy in their areas of influence.<br>
<br>Thomas Lucy might not now be so well known had his name not come to be associated with one of the earliest examples of Shakespeare folklore. Nicholas Rowe was the first to publish this, in 1709 and in some detail, but similar stories can be found in three other autonomous sources of late seventeenth-century date, all ultimately derived, no doubt, from local Stratford gossip. Rowe's account records that the young William Shakespeare, having got into bad company, had more than once stolen deer from Thomas Lucy's park at Charlecote, that he had been caught and rather too severely punished, and that in revenge had composed a ballad satirizing Lucy, which got him into such trouble that he had to leave Stratford for London. Another version of the story introduces the concept that Shakespeare's revenge included a caricature of Lucy in the person of Justice Shallow. Further embellished, this has proved to be one of the most popular and enduring Shakespeare legends, and has provoked much debate as to its authenticity. Some writers have drawn attention to inconsistencies (there was, for example, no formal park at Charlecote at this date), and few claim that the story can be true throughout. Nevertheless, during Shakespeare's youth Thomas Lucy was certainly well known in Stratford. He was regularly entertained by the corporation when visiting the town on official business, is recorded as an arbitrator in a Stratford dispute in 1571, and attended a wedding in the town in 1575. A case can also be made that the account in the opening scene of <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> of Justice Shallow's coat of arms, with its twelve white luces, or pikes, may be an oblique reference to that of the Lucy family itself, with its three silver luces. That the dialogue caricatures Shallow as an ignorant country justice, and includes a disrespectful pun (&#145;louses&#146; for &#145;luces&#146;) and a reference to deer-killing has then been used to argue that Shakespeare, in this scene, was paying off old scores arising out of his youthful crimes recorded in the later stories. If Shakespeare did have Thomas Lucy in mind when, about 1598, he wrote these lines, then clearly he must have had scant regard for this local Stratford figure. However, it need have meant nothing more than that. Furthermore, whether or not deliberate caricature was intended, it is not difficult to see how this passage, when it later became more generally known in Stratford circles, could have been interpreted as hostile to the Lucy interest, and, with its reference to deer-stealing, then turned into the folk-tale which surfaces in the written record at the end of the seventeenth century. We may also note that a payment in 1584 by Coventry corporation to &#145;Sir Thomas Lucies players&#146; does not make Lucy an obvious target for a playwright's satire, and that Shakespeare in <span class="italic">1 Henry VI</span> introduces in a far more flattering light another member of the Lucy family, William, thought to be William Lucy of Charlecote, who died in 1466.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas's wife, Joyce, died on 10 February 1596, and was buried in the parish church at Charlecote on 10 March. She is commemorated in a fine alabaster tomb, with a full-length effigy and a charming inscription composed and &#145;set down by him that best did know what hath been written to be true: Thomas Lucy&#146;. He continued in the execution of his local duties: as late as February 1600 he received a letter from the privy council acknowledging that it had &#145;good cause to note your diligence and endeavour&#146;. He died on 7 July of that year, and was buried alongside his wife on 7 August. Her tomb appears to have been modified to accommodate his full-length effigy. Three heralds attended the funeral, William Camden, as Clarenceux, superintending the ceremonies.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas and Joyce had only two children, Anne and Thomas. Anne married Edward Aston of Tixhall, in Staffordshire, in 1580. The marriage was not a happy one, and led to bitter family feuding. In a letter to his cousin Richard Bagot, Aston paints a dramatic picture of these disagreements, and casts his mother-in-law, in particular, in a light very different from the epitaph on her tomb. Anne died in 1596 and four of her children came to live at Charlecote. This led to a scandalous liaison between one of the daughters, Elizabeth, and a manservant, John Sambach, which clouded Sir Thomas's final days. The couple were married two weeks after his death.<br>
<br>Thomas's son, also Thomas (1551&#150;1605), who survived him by only five years, married twice. His first wife, whom he married on 27 January 1574, was Dorothea, only daughter of Roland Arnold of Highnam in Gloucestershire. She died in 1580, a month after giving birth to a son who did not survive her long. His second wife was Constance, daughter of Sir Richard Kingsmill of Highclere in Hampshire; they had fourteen children. Their eldest son, Thomas (1585&#150;1640), succeeded to the family estates on his father's death in July 1605.<br>
