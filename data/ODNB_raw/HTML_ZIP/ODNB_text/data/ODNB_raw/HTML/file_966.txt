<span class="headword">Baber, Sir  John</span>  (1625&#150;1704), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of John Baber (1592&#150;1646), recorder of Wells, Somerset, and Elizabeth, daughter of William Walrond of Isle Brewers, Somerset, was born in Wells on 18 April 1625. He was educated at Westminster School, and in 1642 was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford. He was ejected from his studentship by the parliamentary visitors, but graduated bachelor of medicine on 3 December 1646, being admitted by virtue of the letters of Colonel John Lambert, governor of the garrison for Oxford. Travelling to the continent, Baber studied medicine at Leiden, and on 10 November 1648 took the degree of MD at Angers. On his return to England he was made DM at Oxford on 18 July 1650.<br>
<br>Baber was a candidate of the College of Physicians, London, on 4 July 1651, and became a fellow on 17 August 1657. He established a practice in London, where he lived in King Street, Covent Garden. During the protectorate he was involved in the affair of Don Pantalean Sa, the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, who was executed for his part in the murder of a man in 1653. Baber, who had harboured Sa after the murder, was pardoned by Cromwell on 9 August 1654  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 3.397). Baber was a JP and involved in parish government.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, on the recommendation of a near neighbour, Thomas Manton, rector of St Paul's, Covent Garden, who, with other Presbyterian divines, had taken a prominent part in the return of Charles II, Baber was made physician to the king, and was knighted on 19 March 1661. In the same year his support for a local dissenting priest led him to be attacked as a &#145;Spye to all sides, a <i>Plague</i> to all his Neighbours, and a <i>Pestilence</i> to the whole Town&#146;  (Donne). Baber frequently acted as a messenger for Charles and Lord Arlington in negotiations in 1668 on comprehension and toleration with Manton and Richard Baxter. North, who describes him as &#145;well known for a Busy Body in such tricking affairs&#146;, states that he was &#145;in possession of the protectorship at court of dissenting preachers&#146;  (North, 362). In September 1669 Baber informed Manton of the king's intention to do his utmost to &#145;get them accepted within the establishment&#146;  (Harris, 7); but it would appear that Charles made use of him to inspire a false trust in his intentions. Baber was banished from court in 1681, along with other dissenters  (Miller, 349&#150;50).<br>
<br>Baber was three times married, first to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Sir John Richards of Yaverland, Isle of Wight; second to Anne, Viscountess Bayning (<i>d</i>. 1678), widow of Henry Murray, a groom of the chamber of Charles I, and daughter of Paul, Viscount Bayning, by licence (1 August 1674); third, on 15 February 1681, to Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1696), widow of Charles Needham, fourth Viscount Kilmorey, and of Sir John Shaw, and daughter of William Drury of Besthorpe, Norfolk. He had three sons, Francis, William, and John, from his first marriage, but no children from the other two marriages. Baber died in 1704 and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 3 April of that year. Robert Wild's <span class="italic">The Grateful Nonconformist</span> (1665) was addressed to Baber.<br>
