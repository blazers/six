<span class="headword">Phillips,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1731&#150;1781), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born about 1731. Some evidence suggests that his parents were Thomas Chichester Phillips (1707&#150;1765) and his wife, Catherine Brudenell, a member of a distinguished military family. He entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich on 1 August 1746 and made rapid progress: lieutenant fireworker, 2 January 1747; quartermaster of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, 1 April 1750 (to May 1756); second lieutenant, 1 March 1755; and first lieutenant, 1 April 1756. Yet another sign of preferment was his appointment, in early 1756, as aide-de-camp to Sir John Ligonier, lieutenant-general of the ordnance. On 12 May 1756 he received an army commission as captain and was given command of a company of miners bound for service in Minorca. When this enterprise was aborted the company was incorporated into the artillery, and Phillips, by transferring his rank in the line, leapfrogged officers who were senior to him.<br>
<br>In 1758 Phillips took command of a brigade of artillery that joined in the army of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. This brigade was heavily involved at Minden (1 August 1759) and distinguished itself by passing through a forest to challenge a French battery. Ferdinand singled out Phillips for recognition and presented him with 1000 crowns. During 1760 Phillips's battery was attached to the cavalry brigade commanded by Lord Granby. At Marburg (30 July) Phillips brought the English artillery on at a gallop to support the cavalry, an unprecedented feat that was acclaimed by both Granby and the French, and on 15 August he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the army. While in Germany he also created the first band for the Royal Artillery.<br>
<br>During the years 1763&#150;8 Phillips divided his time between Woolwich and Minorca. After a year serving as commandant and inspector of artillery at Gibraltar, he returned to Woolwich. In 1769 he became lieutenant-governor of Windsor Castle; this lucrative appointment, which Phillips held until his death (after 1775 executing through deputy), may have come through the governor, George, fourth earl of Cardigan, who was related to him. On 25 May 1772 he was promoted colonel in the army.<br>
<br>The early 1770s also saw Phillips active in politics. A long-time friend of Sir Henry Clinton, he helped organize the campaign that saw Thomas Pelham Clinton, Sir Henry's cousin, returned from Westminster in 1774. On 26 October 1774 Lord North wrote to the duke of Newcastle that Phillips had &#145;distinguished himself at Westminster almost as much as he did at Minden&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>), and with Newcastle's support Phillips was returned from Boroughbridge on 13 March following. His military responsibilities prevented him from participating in parliament, though he held his seat until September 1780.<br>
<br>During his sojourn in England (1763&#150;75) Phillips had at least two extended affairs. The first was with Catherine Cure (later Thomson), a woman of some wealth. In 1768 he eloped with Elizabeth Colleton Browne (1737&#150;1808), the wife (eventually divorced) of Sir John Brathwaite, an army colonel. With Cure, Phillips had two daughters; with Browne, two daughters and two sons. He married neither woman, though by his will, drawn up in New York on 5 January 1781, he left most of his estate to Browne and their children. These children were later legitimized at the instance of Charles, Lord Cornwallis.<br>
<br>After sailing to America in early 1776, Phillips took command of British and German units that supported Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne as the latter pursued the remnants of the American forces that had invaded Canada the year before. Following the evacuation by the Americans of Fort St Johns (19 June 1776) Phillips served there as commander (July&#150;December). During these months he supervised the construction of a British fleet and defensive works on Lake Champlain and won Sir Guy Carleton's praise for his &#145;unwearied diligence&#146;  (Davies, 12.233). He then moved on to Montreal and Quebec, where he served as Burgoyne's second in command and soon became involved in the Burgoyne expedition. Burgoyne gave him practical control of preparation and supply, and of his performance he wrote in July 1777: &#145;it is to his judicious arrangements and indefatigable pains &hellip; that the service is indebted for its present forwardness&#146;. Burgoyne allowed Phillips to command army units in the field, a practice that upset Lord George Germain, who feared the precedent, but Burgoyne explained: &#145;I have always joined artillery to his command, which saves the precedent&#146;  (Davies, 14.141). While on campaign Phillips received two more promotions: major of artillery (25 April 1777) and major-general of the army (29 August 1777).<br>
<br>Phillips played a decisive role in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga on 5 July 1777 by placing four 12-pounders on Mount Defiance, which commanded the fort. At Stillwater, on 19 September, he commanded the left wing, which included Baron Friedrich Adolphus Riedesel's column of German allies, and he personally led the 20th foot forward against the Americans, turning the tide of battle. He commanded the rearguard during the retreat that followed the defeat at Saratoga (7 October) and volunteered to lead a force through the woods to reinforce Ticonderoga. Nevertheless, with the situation deteriorating, he joined other officers in advising Burgoyne to surrender (13 October).<br>
<br>With the capitulation, Phillips entered into more than two years of captivity. Following Burgoyne's return to England on 5 April 1778 he assumed overall command of the convention army. He frequently complained about treatment of the detained men, and after a British officer was shot by an American sentry (17 June 1778) he protested so vehemently that he was temporarily confined. He managed the arduous removal of the army from Cambridge to Charlottesville, Virginia (November 1778 to January 1779), borrowing money to feed the troops. In August 1779 he and Riedesel were paroled, and on 16 September they set out from Virginia. The Continental Congress reconsidered, however, and it was only after Phillips protested to Washington that the two men were allowed to proceed to New York (November 1779). Phillips was soon appointed to a commission to negotiate a general prisoner exchange with the Americans. Finally, on 13 October 1780, he and Riedesel were exchanged.<br>
<br>Sir Henry Clinton, the commander-in-chief and Phillips's friend, often consulted him while he was on parole in New York, and after the exchange he was free to utilize him in the field. Instead of returning him to the artillery&#151;where Phillips was now a lieutenant-colonel, having been promoted on 6 July 1780&#151;in early 1781 Clinton assigned him command of a 2000-man &eacute;lite force, destined for service in Virginia. Phillips sailed from Sandy Hook on 20 March, arrived at Portsmouth, Virginia, six days later, and there added to his command a force led by Major-General Benedict Arnold. According to Clinton's orders Phillips was to buttress the British position at Portsmouth by securing the James and Elizabeth rivers, seize enemy magazines and damage supply lines, and assist Lord Cornwallis in his operations. Clinton believed that Phillips's mission would be completed by June and he would return to New York. Phillips entered Williamsburg unopposed on 20 April, then moved out towards Petersburg, where he hoped to join Cornwallis's army. Near Petersburg, on 25 April, he was challenged by American militia, and in a brief action the Americans were decisively defeated. At Osborne's Landing, on 27 April, Phillips used cannon to destroy a small American squadron. Three days later he directed a raid that resulted in the destruction of large quantities of American stores at Manchester. Phillips returned to Osborne's Landing on 1 May and there fell ill with a fever, possibly typhoid. Virtually incapacitated, he accompanied his force to Petersburg, where he died on 13 May 1781 and was buried. His grave was not marked, but in 1914 the Daughters of the American Revolution raised a monument to him in Petersburg.<br>
