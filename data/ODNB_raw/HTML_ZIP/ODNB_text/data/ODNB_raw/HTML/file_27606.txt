<span class="headword">Townley,  James</span>  (1714&#150;1778), <span class="occ">playwright and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of All Hallows Barking, Essex, on 6 May 1714, the second son of Charles Townley, a merchant of Tower Hill and Clapham, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27605/', "Sir Charles Townley")</script>. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1727 and matriculated as a commoner at St John's College, Oxford, on 15 May 1732; he graduated BA (1735) and MA (1738). Townley simultaneously pursued a vocation in the church; he took priest's orders in May 1738, having taken deacon's orders at Grosvenor Chapel, Westminster, from Bishop Hoadly of Winchester on 6 March 1736.<br>
<br>Townley was chosen as lecturer of St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, on 12 October 1738 and only three years later he was appointed chaplain to Lord Mayor Daniel Lambert. He returned to Merchant Taylors' as third under-master, from 22 December 1748 until July 1753, when he was made grammar-master at Christ's Hospital. Townley again returned to Merchant Taylors', to serve as headmaster in 1760 after a brief stint as morning preacher at Lincoln's Inn (1759&#150;60). While headmaster at Merchant Taylors' he attempted to reconfigure and to modernize the curriculum by introducing mathematics and emphasizing drama. Townley's efforts were greatly assisted by the public support of his friend David Garrick and by his ability to integrate his own playwriting skills. Indeed, Townley's curriculum reform provided him with a forum to commence his career, as Merchant Taylors' staged productions of his pieces <span class="italic">Eunuchus of Terence</span> and <span class="italic">Senecae Troades et ignoramus abbreviatus, in schola mercatorum scissorum</span>.<br>
<br>Following these amateur stagings Townley wrote three original, professionally produced dramatic works: <span class="italic">High Life below the Stairs</span> (1759), <span class="italic">False Concord</span> (1764), and <span class="italic">The Tutor</span> (1765). <span class="italic">High Life below the Stairs</span>, a two-act farce first staged at Drury Lane on 31 October 1759, garnered immediate public and critical acclaim, although some believed the play to be the work of Garrick. Further research and review unequivocally establishes that Townley wrote this piece and that Garrick probably contributed editorial assistance&#151;as Townley did in turn for Garrick, most notably on <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>. Regardless of the question of authorship, <span class="italic">High Life</span> emerged as a smashing popular success; the standard plot of a master who dons the functional yet humorous disguise of a servant to witness and to assess the behaviour of his employees received a great deal of attention&#151;and protest&#151;from its audience, since it became a prominent attraction for all of London society. The play appeared in many editions, was translated into German and French, and was performed on a great many of the world's stages.<br>
<br>Neither of Townley's final two plays, <span class="italic">False Concord</span> and <span class="italic">The Tutor</span>, approached the commercial and artistic success of <span class="italic">High Life</span>. Years after the production of <span class="italic">False Concord</span>, which had not been particularly well received on its appearance at Covent Garden on 20 March 1764 for the benefit of Woodward, Townley's son-in-law John Roberdeau alleged that Garrick plagiarized Townley's dialogue and characters in the 1767 staging of <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>. Specifically Roberdeau claimed, in an 1805 edition of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, that Garrick's characters Lord Ogleby, Mr Sterling, and Brush in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> were exact copies of Townley's Lord Lavender, Mrs Sudley, and a pert valet in <span class="italic">False Concord</span>  (Roberdeau, <span class="italic">GM</span>, 110). Because no print version of <span class="italic">False Concord</span> exists this claim can neither be refuted nor substantiated yet the allegation itself has emerged as more noteworthy than Townley and any of his plays.<br>
<br>Attempts to determine the truth of Roberdeau's charge have, however, unearthed evidence that Townley received critical assistance from David Garrick and William Hogarth. Townley's professional relationship with both Garrick and Hogarth had always been assumed, yet remained speculative, but it is now clear that Townley was a constructive influence on various works of Garrick and Hogarth.<br>
<br>As Townley pursued a dramatic career and became increasingly active in London literary circles he continued to advance in his clerical career. In addition to the early appointments he held in the church he received preferments at the rectory of St Benet Gracechurch (22 July 1749) and St Leonard Eastcheap (1749), as well as the vicarage of Hendon in Middlesex (from 2 November 1772 to 1777). Clearly he benefited in his professional advancements from his marriage in 1740, to Jane Bonnin of Windsor, a descendant of the Poyntz family and a relative of Lady Spencer. Townley had two children: a son, James, who upheld the traditional educational association with Merchant Taylors' and eventually became a proctor in Doctors' Commons, and a daughter, Elizabeth, whose marriage to John Roberdeau is noteworthy because of his aforementioned allegation of plagiarism levied against Garrick. Townley died on 15 July 1778; a tablet was erected in his honour in St Benet Gracechurch.<br>
