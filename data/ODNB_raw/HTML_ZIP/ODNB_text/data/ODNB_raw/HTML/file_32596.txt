<span class="headword">Cowen, Sir  Frederic Hymen <span class="st"> [Hyman Frederick]</span></span>  (1852&#150;1935), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born on 29 January 1852 in Kingston, Jamaica, the younger son of Frederick Augustus Cowen (<i>d</i>. 1876) and his wife, Emily, the second daughter of James Davis of Kingston. Back in England, his father's positions as private secretary to the earl of Dudley and treasurer of Her Majesty's Theatre gave him the entr&eacute;e to concerts at Dudley House (where he himself gave performances) and to opera productions. Cowen was a child prodigy: two dances for piano were published by the time he was seven, and when he was eight an operetta, <span class="italic">Garibaldi</span> (whose libretto was by his sister Rosalind), was performed privately. He made his public d&eacute;but as a pianist in 1863; in 1864 he was the soloist in a performance of Mendelssohn's D minor piano concerto, and in 1865 he performed his own piano trio with the illustrious violinist Joseph Joachim and the cellist Pezze. That year he was awarded the second Mendelssohn scholarship (the first had been awarded to Arthur Sullivan), but his parents refused to accept the terms of the scholarship and he attended the conservatory at Leipzig independently. Later he studied in Berlin. A concert held at St James's Hall, London, in 1869 included his first symphony and his piano concerto, in which the composer, all of seventeen, was the soloist.<br>
<br>From 1871 Cowen spent about seven years as accompanist in J. H. Mapleson's touring opera company and at Her Majesty's, under Sir Michael Costa. Finding his hopes of becoming an opera conductor frustrated, he turned to orchestral conducting, and in 1880 conducted the Promenade Concerts (then held in Covent Garden). He continued to compose. Concert tours in Scandinavia led to the composition of his third symphony, the &#145;Scandinavian&#146;, the premi&egrave;re of which he directed in 1880. Noted for its orchestral effects, this work gained international attention, being conducted by Hans Richter in Vienna in 1882 and later by Cowen himself in Budapest, Stuttgart, Cologne, and Paris, and it was also performed in the United States. Cowen's orchestral compositions eventually included six symphonies and various lighter pieces: he was especially known for the latter, such as the suite <span class="italic">The Language of Flowers</span> (1880). He also developed a reputation as a composer of choral works for music festivals, then a staple part of British musical life, and, in time, of nearly three hundred songs. Some are in a Schumannesque style, but the majority are sentimental ballads which enjoyed great popularity. By the mid-1880s Cowen was among the leading members of the burgeoning &#145;English musical renaissance&#146;. In 1884 he was engaged as a choral conductor in Glasgow; in the Birmingham festival of 1885 his cantata <span class="italic">The Sleepers</span> was heard alongside works by Gounod and Dvo&#345;&aacute;k; and in 1888 he succeeded Sullivan as conductor of the Philharmonic Society, where he improved the orchestral standards and broadened the concert repertories. Grieg and Tchaikovsky were among the musicians who performed with the society during his conductorship. Such was his standing that, also in 1888, he was engaged as the conductor of the Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne for the then extraordinary fee of &pound;5000.<br>
<br>In 1892 a disagreement over rehearsal time led to Cowen's dismissal from the Philharmonic. He now gave renewed energy to opera. Neither his <span class="italic">Pauline</span> (1876) nor <span class="italic">Thorgrim</span> (1890) had achieved success. <span class="italic">Signa</span> was intended as one of a series of English operas initiated in 1891 by D'Oyly Carte. When this project collapsed Cowen managed to have the premi&egrave;re given in Milan&#151;a rare achievement for a British composer&#151;in 1893. But here and later in London it failed, as did <span class="italic">Harold</span> (1895). Cowen blamed these failures on non-musical factors, and with some justification; nevertheless, for all their stylistic versatility, ranging from the Italianate <span class="italic">Signa</span> to the more Wagnerian vein of <span class="italic">Thorgrim</span> and <span class="italic">Harold</span> (which he considered his best), his operas lack sustained dramatic power. Henceforth it was as a conductor that Cowen was primarily known. In 1893 he was again engaged as conductor of the Promenade Concerts, and in 1896 he succeeded Hall&eacute; at Manchester. Engagements at Liverpool and Bradford followed. He bitterly resented being forced to relinquish the Hall&eacute; post to Richter in 1899, claiming prejudice against British musicians in favour of a foreign conductor&#151;a frequent complaint. The following year, 1900, saw his return to the Philharmonic Society and an engagement with the Scottish Orchestra, positions which he held until 1907 and 1910 respectively. While continuing as conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic and the Bradford Festival Choral Society, he took on the triennial Cardiff festival in 1902 and the Handel festival at the Crystal Palace in 1903. Honorary doctorates were awarded by Cambridge in 1900 and by Edinburgh in 1910. Two years earlier, on 23 June 1908, he had married the 26-year-old Frederica Gwendoline, the only daughter of Frederick Richardson, a leather merchant. They had no children. Cowen was knighted in 1911.<br>
<br>This was the pinnacle of Cowen's career. But he found the extensive travelling increasingly tiring and gradually reduced his engagements. By the end of the First World War he had largely retired. The Handel festival of 1923 saw his last major appearance as a conductor. Late in life he gave children's radio broadcasts, published in 1933. His compositions were by this time rarely performed. He died at his home, 105 Maida Vale, London, on 6 October 1935, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery at Golders Green.<br>
<br>In 1932 Elgar had described Cowen as &#145;a dominating factor in the musical life of this country since 1875&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Oct 1935). That importance rested on his work as a conductor. As a composer he was overshadowed first by Sullivan and later by Elgar himself, and his compositions lack outstanding imaginative invention. His conducting drew mixed reactions: for Bernard Shaw it was lethargic, and Cowen was disconcerted when Elgar, in a controversial lecture, placed him no higher than among &#145;choral men&#146;  (Elgar, 129). Nevertheless, for more than forty years he was a focal point in this branch of the musical profession, establishing the status of the British conductor despite assumptions regarding foreign musical superiority.<br>
