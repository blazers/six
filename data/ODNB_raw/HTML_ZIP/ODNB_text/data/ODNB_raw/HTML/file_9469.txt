<span class="headword">Finlayson,  James</span>  (1758&#150;1808), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university teacher</span>, was born on 2 March 1758 at his family's farm at Nether Cambushenie, Dunblane, Perthshire, the eldest son of William Finlayson. He was educated first at a local school in Kinbuck, then at the grammar school in Dunblane, and he began his studies in the University of Glasgow in 1772. He was employed as a private tutor in two families, after which he became an amanuensis to Professor John Anderson. In 1782 he became tutor to two sons of Sir William Murray of Ochtertyre, which enabled him to continue his studies at the University of Edinburgh. Finlayson was licensed to preach in 1785.<br>
<br>In the same year the duke of Atholl offered Finlayson the living of Dunkeld, which he declined, as it had become likely that the chair of logic in the University of Edinburgh would be offered to him, probably through the efforts of Sir William Murray. After some delay, due to the travels and procrastinations of his predecessor, John Bruce, Finlayson took up the post as its joint holder in the winter session of 1786&#150;7, and as its sole incumbent in 1792, on Bruce's eventual resignation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Finlayson was also offered the living of Borthwick, near Edinburgh, and he was ordained minister of that parish on 6 April 1787. On 29 July 1790 he was presented by the magistrates of Edinburgh to Lady Yester's Church; on 9 January 1794 he succeeded William Robertson at Old Greyfriars Church; and on 14 March 1799, he was appointed by the town council to fill a vacancy in St Giles's Church, Edinburgh as a colleague of Hugh Blair, whose funeral sermon he was called upon to preach less than two years later. Besides Blair's funeral sermon, which was prefixed to some nineteenth-century editions of Blair's popular <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, Finlayson published another single sermon (1801) and a posthumous collection of sermons (1809). He also printed a pamphlet in 1798 on the establishment of chapels of ease, which was never published.<br>
<br>This progression of church incumbencies signified increasing recognition of Finlayson's abilities. St Giles's, as the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> put it, was &#145;considered as the most distinguished theatre of pulpit eloquence in Scotland&#146;. Ironically, Finlayson was not considered to be a particularly gifted speaker. He spoke rather monotonously and gave the impression of solidity rather than of brilliance. However, his lucidity, judgement and depth of thought were all greatly admired, whether in the pulpit or in the classroom. He owed his rise within the moderate party in the church to his detailed knowledge of church law and administration, on which he was widely consulted, and which recommended him to the patronage of the Dundas family. The University of Edinburgh conferred on Finlayson the degree of DD on 28 March 1799, and in 1802 he was elected moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was also elected king's almoner in the same year, but he resigned this post almost immediately.<br>
<br>Finlayson was a short, but stout and formidable man, known for his penetrating gaze and gravity of manner. Close friends attested to his kindness and generosity, but others were more struck by his reserve and formality. His diligence was universally acknowledged. In his first parish, Borthwick, he followed Robertson's advice on regular parish visitation, re-establishing it there after a hiatus of nearly thirty years. In the university he was not contented merely to give lectures, as others did, but he regularly taught his students individually as well.<br>
<br>In 1805 Finlayson's health began to decline. Henry Cockburn, an evangelical who had little liking for Finlayson although he had admired him as a teacher, attributed this to the defeat in March of the moderate party in the election of John Leslie to the chair of mathematics rather than their preferred candidate, Thomas McKnight, since Finlayson had been deeply involved in the politicking over the post. In 1807 he was constrained to accept the assistance of one of his earliest friends, Principal George Baird, who taught his class for the remainder of that session. On 25 January 1808 Finlayson suffered a stroke, which paralysed him, and he died three days later. He was given a public funeral in Dunblane Cathedral, where he was buried, on 2 February 1808.<br>
