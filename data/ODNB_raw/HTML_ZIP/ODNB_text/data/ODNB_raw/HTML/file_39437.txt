<span class="headword">Hay,  Josslyn Victor</span>, twenty-second earl of Erroll  (1901&#150;1941), <span class="occ">colonist in Kenya and philanderer</span>, was born on 11 May 1901 at 17 Hertford Street, Mayfair, the elder son of Victor Alexander Sereld Hay (1876&#150;1928), then styled Lord Kilmarnock, who succeeded as twenty-first earl of Erroll in 1927. His mother was (Mary) Lucy Victoria (1875&#150;1957), only daughter of Sir Allan Mackenzie, second baronet. The hereditary office of lord high constable of Scotland had been conferred upon the Hays by Robert the Bruce in 1314 and was expressly reserved to them by the treaty of union. Its ancient prerogatives, including the command in the king's absence of all his armies in the field, had been reduced by the 1920s to bearing a silver baton in coronation processions. Successive earls of Erroll, however, remained the first subjects in Scotland after the blood royal with precedence before every other hereditary honour. The sale by the twentieth earl in 1916 of Slains Castle, with the family's last 4000 acres in Aberdeenshire, severed the Hays' territorial connection with Scotland; the old man moved to a small property at Ravenglass before settling in the terraced house near Paddington Station where he died.<br>
<br>Josslyn Hay, as the most handsome boy at Eton College, was followed down the street by half &#145;Pop&#146;; perhaps in consequence of this effect on the older boys he was sacked from the school after two years, in 1916. His father, Kilmarnock, was a diplomat of charm and ability (he learnt Japanese when posted to Tokyo) who acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires at Berlin from the resumption of diplomatic relations with Germany until the arrival of the new ambassador, Viscount D'Abernon. On 12 January 1920 Josslyn Hay was appointed honorary attach&eacute; at Berlin under his father, who afterwards became British high commissioner on the inter-allied Rhineland commission with the local rank of ambassador (1921&#150;8). Hay, however, remained under D'Abernon in Berlin, until his resignation on 6 March 1922. He had at this time &#145;wonderful good looks&#146;, augmented by &#145;straight pale gold hair&#146; and &#145;great sartorial elegance&#146;, but an &#145;impudent&#146; manner and &#145;scornful way of looking at people&#151;an oblique blue glance under half-closed lids&#146;  (Fielding, 93). Though he passed the Foreign Office examinations, the plan that he should follow his father into diplomacy was ruined by his infatuation with an older married woman. Lady (Myra) Idina Sackville (1893&#150;1955), elder daughter of the eighth Earl De La Warr and divorced wife of the Conservative politician Euan Wallace, was then married to Charles Gordon, whom she swiftly divorced. Hay married her at the earliest opportunity, on 22 September 1923, in Kensington. Their only child, a daughter, later inherited Erroll's Scottish titles.<br>
<br>This <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> mortified Hay's parents and raised a society scandal. In 1924 the Hays settled in Kenya, initially occupying a bungalow which they called Slains, after the lost family castle in Aberdeenshire. The new Slains lay on the slopes of the Aberdare Mountains, where white settlers were establishing high altitude farms. In 1925 the Hays moved to a thatched mansion, Clouds, in a valley beneath the Aberdares, which became notorious as Happy Valley. The <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/101230', "Happy Valley set")</script> (which also congregated in the Muthaiga country club) were displaced patricians seeking to re-establish their hegemony in a malleable, rural society clean of the taint of modern industrial democracy. &#145;Life out there was&#146;, said Baroness Blixen, &#145;rather like eighteenth-century England: one might often be hard up for cash, but life was still rich in many ways, with the lovely landscape, dozens of horses and dogs, and a multitude of servants&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writers at Work</span>, 10). Mentally undisciplined and physically restless, Erroll's set pursued a raffish life of adulteries, binge drinking, cocaine, card sharping, bilked tradesmen, spasmodic violence, and insanity. His debts accumulated as did his tally of adulteries. He was a sensualist with no sense of irony, whose conquests were an exercise of power over women and of humiliating dominance over their menfolk. &#145;To hell with husbands&#146; was one of his favourite sayings. It amused him to borrow fivers from men he had recently cuckolded. His wife divorced him in 1929 because he was cheating her financially. With mercenary motives he swiftly married, at St Martin's register office, on 8 February 1930, another older woman, Edith Mildred Mary Agnes (1893&#150;1939), daughter of Richard Watson Maude (1850&#150;1921); her former husband, Cyril Ramsay-Hill, had cited Erroll in a turbulent divorce. Erroll encouraged his wife in the self-destructive combination of drink, morphine, and heroin. They lived in Oserian, a crenellated, white-washed, Moroccan-style house on the shores of Lake Naivasha.<br>
<br>After his father's death at Koblenz Hay had inherited the earldom, together with the lord high constableship (1928), and rose to prominence among what his friend Ewart Grogan called Kenya's &#145;large, virile and articulate European population&#146;  (Grogan, 83). Erroll joined Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (1934&#150;5), but though his political instincts were both violent and reactionary, his extremism receded. Accordingly he was elected president of the Convention of Associations, known as the Settlers' Parliament (1935), and to the legislative council as member for Kiambu (1939). Commissioned as a captain in the Kenya regiment (1939), he was an exacting and efficient deputy director of manpower and military secretary to east Africa command from 1940. Though he had coarsened, and weighed 15 stone, Erroll continued to attract women. On 30 November 1940 at the Muthaiga club he met the young, newly married wife of Sir Delves Broughton; they were soon lovers. Broughton played the part of a complaisant husband, but was goaded by spiteful anonymous letters. On 21 January 1941 both men consulted lawyers about the Broughtons' divorce. After an evening which they spent together at the Muthaiga club, Erroll was ambushed and shot under the left ear on 24 January 1941, on the Nairobi&#150;Ngong Road, while motoring in his Buick. He was buried at Nairobi on 25 January.<br>

<a name="cosubject_63249"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Henry John) Delves <span class="st"> [Jock]</span> Broughton</span>, eleventh baronet  (1883&#150;1942)<span class="occ"></span>, was accused of the murder. Born on 10 September 1883, he was the only surviving child of Sir Delves Louis Broughton, tenth baronet (1857&#150;1914), and his first wife, Rosamond Broughton (1862&#150;1885). A loveless childhood left him with a lifelong sense of deprivation, which did not diminish when he inherited the baronetcy with extensive estates in Cheshire and Staffordshire. He was educated at Eton College (1897&#150;1900), where his father's meanness supposedly drove him to steal, and at a crammer before entrance to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Commissioned second lieutenant in the Irish Guards (10 December 1902), he was aide-de-camp to the lieutenant-governor of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (1908) and promoted major (15 July 1915) despite evading military action in the European war on the pretext of sunstroke. He retired from the army on 15 April 1919 and was excluded from the published <span class="italic">List of Etonians who Fought in the Great War</span>. Broughton was a proud, unintelligent man who was easily bored and had few distractions except extravagant living. He lost his fortune not only on racecourses but in foolish speculations in foreign exchange markets, commodity dealing, and mining shares. For a time he was chairman of Dalkeith (Ceylon) Rubber Estates and a director of Pindenioya Rubber and Tea Estates; he also bought coffee plantations in Kenya after 1923. He funded these business forays with characteristic deviousness by selling pictures, heirlooms, and over 30,000 acres in several tranches. These were not his possessions but belonged to family trusts. His son took legal action during 1939 to protect his interests, but Broughton was determined not to be bested, and arranged for a young Harrovian to steal heavily insured pearls from a car on the French riviera that summer, and then blackmailed his accomplice into stealing three heavily insured portraits from his Cheshire seat, Doddington (October 1939). Despite these frauds Broughton (a Cheshire magistrate since 1915) had so wasted his assets that he was obliged to shut Doddington and decamp to Africa.<br>
<br>Broughton had married, on 8 July 1913, at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, Vera Edyth (1894&#150;1968), daughter of Boscawen Trevor Griffith-Boscawen of Trevalyn Hall, Trefalun, Denbighshire. They had one son and one daughter. Vera Broughton was a hard, pleasure-loving woman whose passion for big-game hunting first took them to Kenya in 1919&#150;20. After affairs with the third earl of Wharncliffe and the first Baron Sherwood, she deserted Broughton in 1935 for Walter Guinness, first Baron Moyne. The aridity of Broughton's marriage increased his tendency to sourness, sulks, loneliness, and self-pity. From 1935 he pursued another cold, hard <i>femme fatale</i> of implacable chic, Diana (1913&#150;1987), divorced wife of a society musician, Vernon Motion, daughter of Seymour Caldwell, gambler, and sister of the marchioness of Willingdon. She ran the Blue Goose cocktail club in Bruton Mews, Mayfair, and was a fashionable aviator. Broughton's wife began divorce proceedings in 1939 in expectation of marrying Moyne. Following the dissolution of the marriage, Broughton married Diana Caldwell (5 November 1940) in a register office at Durban, South Africa. Three weeks later his wife met Erroll, who was murdered within three months. Broughton was arrested (10 March 1941) and stood trial from 26 May. The prosecution's ballistic evidence was weak, there was no eyewitness connecting him with the crime, and his witness-box performance was effective. Despite his acquittal on 1 July, evidence of a confession published forty years later confirmed the probability of his guilt. After a miserable interval Broughton returned to England (November 1942) to find that he was the object of police investigations into the insurance frauds. Having injected himself fourteen times with a morphine derivative, he died on 5 December 1942 in an ambulance speeding from the Adelphi Hotel to Northern Hospital, Liverpool, and was interred on 10 December at Broughton church, Eccleshall, Staffordshire. The Erroll murder was depicted in Michael White's film <span class="italic">White Mischief</span> (1987).<br>
