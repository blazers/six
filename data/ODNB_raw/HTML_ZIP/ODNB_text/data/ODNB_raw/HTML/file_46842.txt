<span class="headword">Cooper family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1854&#150;1994), <span class="occ">accountants</span>, came to prominence as the result of the achievements of four of the sons of Emanuel Cooper (1794/5&#150;1851), who was one of the founders of the London and County Bank, its deputy chairman from 1841, and a well-known advocate of the abolition of slavery. He was also a staunch Quaker, but was dismissed by the bank in 1848 having advanced himself some &pound;16,000 which he was unable to repay. The bank's records contain a pitiful letter from his widow requesting money to keep her from penury. The request was dismissed, but is consistent with complaints made by Francis and Ernest in later life that they did not have enough to eat in their childhood days.<br>
<br>Emanuel and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ranson), had thirteen children. The four sons who were to found and for many years dominate their accountancy practice were: his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59176"></a><span class="headword">William Cooper</span>  (<em>c.</em>1826&#150;1871), public <span class="occ">accountant</span>; his second son, <a name="cosubject_46842"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Cooper</span>  (1833&#150;1892), chartered <span class="occ">accountant</span>; <a name="cosubject_59177"></a><span class="headword">Francis Cooper</span>  (1845/6&#150;1893), chartered <span class="occ">accountant</span>; and his seventh son and youngest child, <a name="cosubject_46843"></a><span class="headword">Ernest Cooper</span>  (1847&#150;1926), chartered <span class="occ">accountant</span>. It also appears that the other three brothers and two or three of the sisters occasionally helped out in the early days.<br>
<br>William and Arthur started off as clerks in London in the office of Quilter, Ball &amp; Co., which is thought to have had the largest accountancy practice in England in the middle of the nineteenth century. William left to set up a practice in his own name at 13 George Street, London, in 1854. The firm's name was changed to W. and A. Cooper in 1858, soon after the admission of Arthur to the partnership in 1857, and Cooper Brothers &amp; Co. in 1860. Francis was probably admitted to partnership in 1871 and Ernest a year later, having each initially trained with the family firm.<br>
<br>William died in 1871, seventeen years after founding the firm, and was succeeded as senior partner by Arthur. Arthur was privately regarded by the family as the ablest of the four brothers, followed by Francis, who suffered from diabetes and died in 1893 at the age of forty-seven. In 1910 two of the second-generation Coopers were admitted to the partnership: Arthur's son Harold Arthur Cooper (resigned in 1913 and killed in action in France in 1916), and Francis's son (Francis) D'Arcy Cooper, son of Francis and his wife Ada Frances, daughter of Henry Power, surgeon. Ernest's son Stuart Ranson Cooper became a partner in 1921 and retired in 1946.<br>
<br>The original Cooper brothers had well-earned reputations for uprightness and honesty in their business dealings; and this may have stemmed from a religious commitment instilled in them by their Quaker parents. They were initially active in the days prior to the formation of professional accounting bodies in England and Wales. Ernest, who was a colourful writer, made the following often quoted characterization (some might say caricature) in relation to the accountant's position in 1864:<blockquote>We could hardly, South of the Tweed, claim to be a profession. There was absolutely no organisation or co-operation, no Institute or Society, no examinations, very few articled clerks, no newspaper, no library, no benevolent fund, and not even a dining club or golf club. &hellip; Our social position was not enviable. We may disregard the then current gibes, that if an accountant were required, he would be found at the bar of the nearest tavern to the Bankruptcy Court in Basinghall Street, and that an accountant was a man who had failed in everything else &hellip; but an accountant was regarded as associated with and dependent upon insolvency, and I well remember that to be seen talking to or having your office entered by an accountant, was to be avoided, particularly in the stressful times of 1866. (Cooper, 554)</blockquote>This has been one of the cornerstones of the conventional view of late Victorian accountants: as being almost entirely reliant on fraud and liquidation work, until the more widespread growth of the limited liability company requiring audit towards the end of the nineteenth century. Recent research, however, suggests that, while some firms were heavily reliant on liquidation and fraud, others, including Cooper Brothers itself, had a much wider portfolio.<br>
<br>Liquidation work was clearly of importance to the company, however, with Arthur, for example, liquidating the Oriental Commercial Bank and acting as receiver of the Swedish and Norwegian Railway Company. Indeed, his obituary in <span class="italic">The Accountant</span> suggested that as trustee in bankruptcy he probably had more and larger estates than any other London accountant. In focusing on this area, Arthur was undoubtedly playing to his strength. Sir John Hollams (considered one of the finest lawyers of this period), who worked a great deal with Arthur, judged him to have a remarkable legal brain &#145;honed on and critical in insolvency work&#146;  (Jones, &#145;Cooper, Arthur&#146;, 777).<br>
<br>Arthur died in 1892 and Ernest, who is known to have been in part educated abroad at a Roman Catholic school, took over as senior partner. This change in due course released an important constraint on the firm's development: Arthur had insisted that partners must be able personally to supervise all the firm's work. Under the new regime branches were opened, beginning with Liverpool in 1920 and an overseas office in Brussels in 1921. With the growth of professional firms reflecting the success of their clients, the introduction of William Hesketh Lever to Ernest Cooper by the District Bank was a key event, and it is thought that Ernest prepared the &#145;Accountants' report&#146; for the prospectus issued by Lever Brothers Ltd on becoming a public company in 1894.<br>
<br>Ernest's experience as an accountant had its lighter and its darker sides. When he was on a visit to Hamburg to carry out an investigation in 1874, an attempt was made to bribe him (he was invited to &#145;name his price&#146;); and in 1892 he won &pound;2000 in damages from a newspaper (resulting in its bankruptcy) for unjustified criticism of his role as special manager and trustee of Barker's Bank. In 1927 the firm was sacked as auditors of Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company amid public controversy. Cooper Brothers had qualified the company's accounts commencing 1920 with respect to the value placed by the directors on the shares held in associated companies and patents. It may be that the wording of their audit report was insufficiently clear-cut, a criticism which has been levelled against the accountancy profession on numerous occasions over the years. It is certainly known that, when Marconi's financial position deteriorated and reorganization proposals were under consideration in 1927, a group of shareholders demonstrated against the auditors and opposed their reappointment. The resignation of Cooper Brothers drew the following comment from the leader writer of <span class="italic">The Accountant</span> (2 April 1927) which also has a perennial ring about it:<blockquote>In the present case, we say roundly, the ultimate blame lies on shareholders who year after year have slumbered while their watch dog dutifully barked. They have now roused themselves to find that the house has been burgled, and it does them little credit that their only action is to buy two new watch dogs.</blockquote>Of the four brothers, it was Arthur and Ernest who were active in the establishment of professional accounting organizations. A member of the &eacute;lite Institute of Accountants in London, formed in 1870, Ernest wrote a letter to its officers in 1877 criticizing the lack of technical facilities and its poor performance in attracting new membership relative to the Society of Accountants in England (formed in 1872). Arthur had been a council member of the Institute of Accountants since 1876, and the firm's official history suggests that the concerted efforts of these two brothers probably played a significant part in the formation of the most important accountancy body outside Scotland. This was the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), which was formed from the merger of five accountancy bodies already established south of the border, including the Institute of Accountants.<br>
<br>Arthur Cooper was a member of the ICAEW's first council, vice-president in 1882&#150;3, and president in 1883&#150;4. His proficiency in legal matters enabled him to devise by-laws designed to regulate members' conduct at a time when this fledgeling profession was struggling to raise its status, and he was a member of an institute committee appointed to make recommendations to the Board of Trade about the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span> which finally resulted in the act of 1883. Ernest was elected to the council in 1891, was president from 1899 to 1901, and remained on the council for a total of thirty-three years. Indeed, ever since the ICAEW was formed, at least one of the firm's partners has been a council member.<br>
<br>In 1869 Arthur Cooper married Maria, daughter of Edward Joseph Cole, a merchant; they had three sons and three daughters. He died on 22 August 1892 at Cuorabelle, Westgate-on-Sea, during a short break from the office. Ernest married Edith Isabella Henderson and they had a son and a daughter. Ernest died on 4 January 1926 at East Court, East Grinstead.<br>
<br>There is some evidence that Cooper Brothers suffered more than most accountancy firms &#145;by the calls of the Services&#146; during the First World War, and the key figure in their early post-war revival was the highly talented <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32550/', "Sir (Francis) D'Arcy Cooper (1882&#150;1941)")</script>, whose resignation as senior partner in 1923 to become vice-chairman of the soap manufacturers Lever Brothers was a major set-back and judged to be an important contributory factor to the firm's slow rate of growth in the inter-war period. The last partner to bear the Cooper name was Vivian Rupert Vaughan, son of Harold Arthur Cooper and grandson of Arthur, who was admitted to partnership in 1935, retired in 1973, and died in 1994.<br>
<br>The partnership founded by the Cooper brothers has been one of the leading firms of accountants since the early days of the profession. It was in the vanguard undertaking insolvency work and, in 1886, it was the seventh largest firm in terms of the number of quoted company audits. Its success probably owes much to Emanuel's injunction to his family to hold together like a bundle of sticks which cannot be broken. The most significant partner in the years after the Second World War was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67861/', "Henry Alexander Benson, Baron Benson")</script>. The nephew of Sir (Francis) D'Arcy and grandson of Francis Cooper, Benson was admitted to partnership in 1934 and became joint senior partner in 1946 following the retirement of Stuart Cooper who, although able, was not in favour of rapid growth. The firm was subsequently the subject of a whirlwind expansion, sometimes attracting criticism and envy from competitors directed at what were considered to be overtly commercial practices. The firm was renamed Coopers and Lybrand following merger with the American firm of Lybrand, Ross Bros. and Montgomery in 1973 and became one of the largest such firms in the world. It merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998 to form PriceWaterhouseCoopers.<br>
