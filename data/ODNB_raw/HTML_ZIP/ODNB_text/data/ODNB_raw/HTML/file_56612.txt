<span class="headword">Ogden,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1790), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, is a figure whose life is obscure, but is nevertheless credited as the &#145;father of bookmaking&#146;  (&#145;Bookmaking then and now&#146;, 78).<br>
<br>For centuries horse-racing involved the matching of two horses by owners who wished to bet against each other. These contests were often foregone conclusions and were sterile for betting purposes. Consequently by the late 1750s sweepstakes had come into vogue. Such races included more horses and so had a variety of outcomes. The increased number of owners involved in a contest meant that there was a selection of odds against their horses winning. This meant that a clever owner could bet in a more sophisticated fashion. He could cover himself against the loss of his horse and the prize money by backing other runners to win.<br>
<br>This system of hedging bets was adopted enthusiastically and it attracted professional betters who were called &#145;blacklegs&#146;. With the owners they gathered at Hyde Park Corner at Tattersall's, where there was a subscription room for patrons &#145;to transact their Turf financial business&#146; and to make bets well before a particular contest was run  (Fairfax-Blakeborough, 7). At the racecourses betters gathered at a betting chair, as Thomas Rowlandson showed in a drawing in 1789. Their aim was &#145;to get round&#146; in their transactions, to make sure that they did not lose whatever the result. These bets were laid on a one-to-one basis and no person stood up to take bets from all comers.<br>
<br>It is believed that Ogden &#145;made his appearance about 1790 or thereabouts&#146;  (Hodgson, 2). Strictly speaking, he was not a bookmaker in the modern sense. He was a practitioner of &#145;betting one with the field&#146;, favouring a single horse in a race and offering one price for the rest of the runners collectively. Unlike a bookie he did not offer individual odds for each horse, but in contrast to other betters he was prepared to lay bets on all the runners. Ogden was nevertheless one of a number of men who were the architects of the final stage in the development of professional betting into bookmaking, as sweepstake racing became dominant in the early nineteenth century. Nothing is known about his death, but he was reputed to be &#145;the only betting man who was ever admitted to the club at Newmarket&#146;  (The Druid, 46&#150;7).<br>
