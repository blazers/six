<span class="headword">Poer,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1178?), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of Ralph Poer, who held lands in the de Courcy honour of Stogursey, Somerset. He had sons, <a href="#cosubject_50173">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a> and John, and a brother, William. William Poer until 1177, and then Robert, administered the de Courcy honour during the minority of William de Courcy (1171&#150;89). A Robert Poer is found continuously in royal service in England between 1166 and 1189; he accounted for lands in Yorkshire, 1166&#150;7, and answered for the forest of Galtres (in Yorkshire) from 1169 to 1189. He accompanied Henry II to Ireland in 1171&#150;2, where he witnessed Henry's charter in favour of the priory of All Hallows, Dublin, and in 1174 he was in charge of Brabantine mercenaries who were being sent back to the continent from England. In 1176 he returned to Ireland in royal service as one of four knights sent to summon back to England Raymond Fitzgerald, who, according to Gerald of Wales, was accused of acting like a Brabantine. The death in the same year of Richard de Clare (Strongbow) necessitated arrangements for the administration by the crown of the lordship of Leinster during the minority of Strongbow's heir. At the Council of Oxford, 1177, Robert (styled &#145;marshal&#146; by Roger of Howden, but not on the pipe rolls) was appointed <i>custos</i> of Waterford and the adjoining territory as far as Lismore as well as Ossory. He was one of those royal officials whom Gerald of Wales criticized and held responsible for the abandonment through cowardice of the castle of Leighlin. Although there has been much uncertainty on the point, it is likely that an entry in the unpublished eighteenth-century compilation known as the Dublin annals of Inisfallen (Trinity College, Dublin, MS H.I.18), the sources of which have not yet been traced, recording the death of Robert Poer in 1178 while on an expedition against the O'Tooles in north Leinster, is correct.<br>
<br>Poer was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_50173"></a><span class="headword">Robert Poer</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1228)<span class="occ"></span>, who has been confused with his father. It was this second Robert Poer, described as a knight of the domestic and military household of the king of England, who in 1188 was seized by Raymond, count of Toulouse, as he returned from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. In 1194 Richard I temporarily deprived him of lands in Knaplock (Somerset), Sexington (Oxfordshire), and Shenington (Gloucestershire), for siding with John, count of Mortain, during the latter's rebellion against Richard. Between 1186 and 1191 Robert Poer, who had a wife, Margaret, and a son, John, granted the churches of Dunshaughlin and the chapel of his castle there, as well as the chapel of Ratoath and other churches in Meath, to St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin. Since Hugh de Lacy had granted the ecclesiastical benefices of the fee of Dunshaughlin to St Thomas's Abbey in 1183, and since Walter de Lacy subsequently granted Ratoath to his brother, Hugh de Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1242), it is likely that Robert Poer had been enfeoffed in Meath by John, lord of Ireland, who following the death of Hugh de Lacy in 1186 had attempted to retain the lordship of Meath in his own hands, and that Walter overturned this grant when he gained seisin of Meath. Robert Poer witnessed Irish charters relating to lands in Meath in the 1180s and 1190s, and about 1200 in Leinster and Tipperary also. From 1174 until 1221 a Robert Poer made an annual payment in reduction of a debt owed by Galfridus fitz Hawine, whose house in London was in king's hand and may have been given to Robert Poer; between 1218 and 1221, however, the templars answered for this debt on behalf of Robert Poer. Given the time-span of this continuous series of entries, it is evident that the first Robert Poer had been succeeded by his son and namesake. By November 1228 John, son and heir of the younger Robert Poer, had succeeded to his father's lands held of the king in Ireland.<br>
<br>Other members of the family involved in Ireland included <a name="cosubject_50174"></a><span class="headword">William Poer</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1184&#150;1200) and <a name="cosubject_50175"></a><span class="headword">Simon Poer</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1190). There is no evidence to support earlier suggestions that William and Simon were brothers. William may have been the son of William Poer, brother of the elder Robert Poer. He is said by Gerald of Wales to have distinguished himself at Waterford, and he is found witnessing charters relating to land in the vicinity. His expenses for crossing to Ireland were accounted for in 1184&#150;5, and in October 1200 he witnessed two charters of King John relating to grants of land in Ireland. Simon Poer held lands of John of Clahull in Leighlin; he was enfeoffed also with lands in Cork by Milo of Cogan. He died in 1190.<br>
