<span class="headword">Buckton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Williams]</span>,  Catherine Mary</span>  (1826/7&#150;1904), <span class="occ">promoter of household science teaching</span>, was born in London, the daughter of John Morgan Williams, a surgeon, later of Llandaff, Glamorgan. On 22 March 1849 she married Joseph Buckton, a Leeds cloth merchant, with whom she had a son and a daughter. She was a founder member of the Leeds Ladies' Educational Association (1869), which promoted women's higher education and organized the Cambridge local examinations in the city. She was also active on the Yorkshire Ladies' Council of Education, a voluntary body which in 1871 began evening classes for working girls employed in factories, shops, and as domestic servants. Members of the Ladies' Council, drawn mainly from influential professional and business families, were supporters of sanitary reform, and they were concerned by the evidence which these classes brought to light of a widespread ignorance of the laws of health and domestic economy. Statistics gathered by a Leeds medical practitioner, James Braithwaite, exposed the comparatively high mortality rate in the city. During the winter of 1871&#150;2 Catherine Buckton gave a course of lectures to working women and mothers at Holbeck Mechanics' Institute on &#145;domestic physiology and the laws of health&#146;, parallel courses being given by Emily Kitson and Mary Anne Baily. These culminated in a conference at Leeds town hall in November 1872 on the teaching of hygiene.<br>
<br>In 1873, standing as a Liberal, Catherine Buckton was elected the first woman member of the Leeds school board, the second largest school board in the country after London. Industrious and intellectually able, she was an effective school board member, gaining re-election in 1876 and 1879 at the top of the poll. Her experience of evening classes convinced her that only by systematic teaching of hygiene in board schools could the health of future generations be improved. From 1874 she gave annual physiology and health lectures to the oldest board school girls, of whom sixty were subsequently chosen each year to attend the Yorkshire School of Cookery, founded in 1874 by the Ladies' Council, to gain practical instruction. In due course, health, hygiene and cookery instruction became an essential part of the Leeds school board curriculum. Catherine Buckton personally determined the syllabus, rebutting criticisms from some teachers that it was overloaded, and she was generally welcomed by head teachers into their schools to give practical cookery demonstrations. Few schools adopted her advice to establish specialist cookery rooms, but as most working-class homes did not have separate kitchens she acknowledged the need to teach girls to manage efficiently in a small space.<br>
<br>From 1875 Catherine Buckton began to publish her health, hygiene, and basic cookery advice. <span class="italic">Health in the House</span> (1875) and <span class="italic">Food and Home Cookery</span> (1879) were also popular with school boards outside Leeds and continued to be reprinted into the 1880s. Her love of nature, combined with her desire to improve the children's home environment, led to hundreds of children growing and exhibiting their own plants. Her subsequent <span class="italic">Town and Window Gardening</span>, based on her lectures, was published in 1879. In due course all her works became required reading in the cookery training schools, giving her a national, as well as a local, reputation.<br>
<br>A strong Unitarian, Catherine Buckton's educational interests extended beyond developing the quantity and quality of girls' schooling. Despite persistent and vociferous opposition from supporters of denominational schools on the Leeds board, including some of her fellow Liberals, she vigorously campaigned for free secular education. After visiting schools on the continent, she became convinced that the first stage of schooling was the most important. She persuaded the board to experiment with the new Froebel kindergarten method and to introduce the phonic system of spelling into all Leeds board schools. Sensitive towards children's needs, she managed to convince board members in 1876 of the need for a half-time day industrial school which could provide work, schooling, and daytime meals for difficult children. She subsequently monitored progress at the industrial school, condemning excessive punishments and objecting in 1882 to the appointment of a former prison gaoler as the school's superintendent.<br>
<br>In 1882, overworked and worn down by the continual denominational battles over elementary education, Catherine Buckton retired from the board and moved to London, where she continued to write on health and hygiene issues. Before she left Leeds she produced an influential <span class="italic">Address</span> on education in the city, which the Liberals used in their successful 1882 school board election campaign. Her concern for women's rights made her a keen advocate of equal pay and women's suffrage. Her last publication was <span class="italic">Comfort and Cleanliness: the Servant and Mistress Question</span> (1894).<br>
<br>Catherine Buckton has secured an important place in the history of the British domestic science education movement. With her contemporaries Fanny Calder, in Liverpool, and Edith Clarke, in London, she was responsible for the introduction of cookery and hygiene onto the school curriculum. In contrast to Miss Calder, who chose teachers with a good general education and then taught them about cookery, Mrs Buckton believed domestic science teachers should first and foremost be expert cooks. This approach tended to exclude some women who would otherwise have made good instructors. She died, a widow, at her London home, 27 Ladbroke Square, Kensington, on 20 May 1904. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> praised her as a pioneer of &#145;much that is now esteemed as most useful and practical in the education of girls&#146;.<br>
