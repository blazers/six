<span class="headword">Waller,  Henry Hirst <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1861&#150;1949), <span class="occ">rugby administrator</span>, was born on 11 August 1861 at Waring Green, Brighouse, Yorkshire, the elder of two sons of Abraham Waller, one of Brighouse's leading textile manufacturers, and his wife, Martha Ann Crossley. His grandfather had introduced cotton spinning to the town. Educated at Silcoates grammar school, near Wakefield, he helped to found the local rugby club, Brighouse Rangers, in 1878 and played until he received four broken ribs in a game in 1894. He then became a leading campaigner for a relaxation of rugby's amateur rules and for paying working-class players compensation for &#145;broken time&#146;, or time lost from work.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1895 Waller chaired the historic meeting at the George Hotel in Huddersfield at which twenty-two leading northern rugby clubs voted to leave the Rugby Football Union and found the Northern Rugby Football Union (NU), which in 1922 became the Rugby Football League. The first decision of the new body was to legalize payments of no more than 6<i>s</i>. per day for broken time. At this meeting Waller was elected president, a position he was to hold for the next two years, during which the NU grew from its original 22 clubs to over 150. As president of the NU, he oversaw a number of rule changes, such as the abolition of the line-out, which were to lay the basis for the modern game of rugby league football. After stepping down from the presidency in 1897, he continued to play a leading role on the sport's general committee until 1902, most notably in helping to steer the game towards professionalism.<br>
<br>An articulate public speaker, Waller played the central role in developing the NU's self-image as a democratic sport. A lifelong Liberal, he became the Liberal chairman of Greetland urban district council in 1905, was the founding senior vice-chairman of the Urban District Councils' Association, and in 1906 was appointed a JP. His political principles guided his philosophy for rugby, and he believed that &#145;the game brought men together and united them in brotherhood which could hardly be found elsewhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 30 April 1894). In 1890 he had taken over the running of the family business, and this experience informed his belief in the importance of the social role of the NU. He saw rugby as a means of assisting working-class players to better themselves, and was instrumental in introducing the NU's 1898 &#145;work clauses&#146;, whereby only those in regular employment were allowed to play, arguing that &#145;the Northern Union was anxious to make football the means of improving the positions of players&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 23 May 1898).<br>
<br>After Brighouse Rangers disbanded in 1906 owing to financial problems, Waller became a regular spectator at Halifax rugby league club's matches. In November 1945, as the only surviving founder of the NU, he was guest of honour of the Rugby Football League at the game's jubilee banquet. He died on 19 May 1949 at Lyndhurst, Greetland, Halifax, Yorkshire, leaving a widow and two sons, and a daughter from his first marriage; he was buried three days later in Brighouse cemetery.<br>
