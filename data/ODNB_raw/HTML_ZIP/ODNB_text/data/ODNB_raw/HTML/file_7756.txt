<span class="headword">Dodson,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1705&#150;1757), <span class="occ">mathematician and actuary</span>, was the son of John Dodson (<i>b</i>. 1675), citizen and freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and his wife, Elizabeth, who died shortly after his birth. His grandfather, also John Dodson, was a tailor of Edmonton, Middlesex. It is not known if Dodson, who became free of the Merchant Taylors' Company by patrimony in 1733, was ever employed as a tailor, but he was at one time a student under Abraham De Moivre, and as a young man he devoted himself to the unremunerative task of calculating antilogarithms. He married on 28 October 1735 at St Clement Danes, Westminster, Elizabeth Goodwin, the ward of Sir John Chesshyre, from whom he received a loan of &pound;300. He may thereafter have earned his living as a writing-master, for some years later he was living in Warwick Lane, near St Paul's Cathedral, under the sign of the Hand and Pen, which was widely used by such teachers. Handwriting, in the new style known as copperplate, developed during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, was a principal subject of a commercial education, along with accounting and arithmetic. In 1744 William Mountaine and Dodson produced an updated version of Edmond Halley's isogonic magnetic chart, which they published in 1746; a later updated edition was presented to the Royal Society thirteen days before Dodson's death.<br>
<br>At some time before 1747 Dodson removed to Bell-Dock, Wapping, where in that year he was describing himself as an accountant and teacher of mathematics. In the preface to <span class="italic">The Calculator</span> (a book of tables), Dodson claimed that he would examine accounts, advise businessmen of the form of accounting best suited to their business, and oversee their clerks until they were familiar with its working. In time Dodson built up a reputation as a consultant on the values of annuities, and his first letter to the Royal Society was a plea for more information to be given in the bills of mortality which could assist in such valuations. When the Revd William Brakenridge sent the society a life table calculated from the London bills of mortality from 1744 to 1753, Dodson wrote to the society that he felt it was his duty to compute the values of annuities according to Brakenridge's table. Dodson's major work, <span class="italic">The Mathematical Repository</span>, was published in three volumes in 1748, 1753, and 1755. The first volume was dedicated to De Moivre; the second was dedicated to David Papillon and contained a contribution by De Moivre. A classic of actuarial science, the <span class="italic">Repository</span> displayed Dodson's mastery of algebra and his knowledge of the subject of annuities, and it earned him election to the Royal Society in January 1755.<br>
<br>In May or early June 1755, Dodson took over the mathematics classes at Christ's Hospital in place of John Robertson who had moved to the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, and on 22 July he was formally appointed master of the Royal Mathematical School, and Stone's School, institutions within Christ's Hospital. It was a brief tenure, but following his death in November 1757, his salary was paid up to April 1758 to benefit his children.<br>
<br>In his closing years Dodson's interest turned to life assurance. It was said that he was denied admission to the Amicable Life Assurance Society, being over forty-five years old, and that this led him to advertise asking for those interested in a project for a new form of life assurance to meet him at the Queen's Head, Paternoster Row, on 2 March 1756. He set out the operating system for mutual life assurance, showing how premiums should be calculated, and worked some examples to show how the fund would be maintained. His (unpublished) &#145;First lecture on insurances&#146; was written about this time, and from a series of such meetings the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships developed, though Dodson did not live to see its formation. He died on 23 November 1757, leaving a widow and three children, James (<i>b</i>. 1742), who later became actuary for the Equitable Society, as it was by then known, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1744), and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1749). In his will, Dodson made arrangements for his share of the profits (5<i>s</i>. for every &pound;100 paid in) which would accrue once the Equitable received its royal charter, and for repayment of his debt to Sir John Chesshyre's estate. Dodson's granddaughter Elizabeth later married Colonel James De Morgan; their son was Augustus De Morgan (1806&#150;1871), logician and professor of mathematics at University College, London.<br>
