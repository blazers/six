<span class="headword">Andrews,  Michael James</span>  (1928&#150;1995), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 30 October 1928 at 142 Glebe Road, Norwich, the second child of Thomas Victor Andrews, an insurance clerk, and his wife, Gertrude Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Green. Reared a Methodist and readied by his parents for a job for life in the Norwich Union Insurance Society, he veered into art while a sixth-former at the City of Norwich School, when he attended Saturday morning classes at the Norwich School of Art. His two years' national service with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps included nineteen months spent in Egypt, mainly confined to the army base at Tell al-Kebir. Having secured a place at the Slade School of Fine Art he began there in 1949 immediately after his discharge, studying under William Coldstream. His contemporaries included Craigie Aitchison, Euan Uglow, and Victor Willing, and his tutors included Lucian Freud and Lawrence Gowing. Freud was impressed by his courteous dismissal of suggested improvements to his painting <span class="italic">The Rocking Horse</span>. It was already apparent by 1952, when he completed his diploma picture, <span class="italic">A Man who Suddenly Fell Over</span> (Tate collection), that, as Gowing wrote in 1980, &#145;a good painter's course was predestined&#146;  (<span class="italic">Michael Andrews</span>, introduction). Gowing remembered wondering if &#145;this lanky, diffident young man could possibly explore the oddness of these perceptions of his&#146;.<br>
<br>Andrews's perceptions remained phenomenally idiosyncratic. The <span class="italic">Man who Suddenly Fell Over</span>&#151;a stout grown-up in a dark suit (an insurance agent perhaps) making a spectacle of himself, his expression puzzled rather than pained in the split second before he hits the ground&#151;introduced a preoccupation with states of mind and reaction to circumstances. Themes to do with instinct (domestic instinct, herd instinct), themes of glamour, anxiety, alienation, and exhilaration, themes rich in implication&#151;all were developed into telling images.<br>
<br>&#145;An image gets weight as it goes along,&#146; Andrews remarked; &#145;It snowballs&#146;  (<span class="italic">X: a Quarterly Review</span>, 1/2, March 1960, 141). Ostensibly straightforward&#151;a family group or a student-party scene&#151;each painting was an enquiry into motives and an examination of repercussions; &#145;Once one is launched on a subject, everything you pick up seems to apply&#146;  (ibid.). Cumulatively his art demonstrated the unique capacity of painting to embody ideas, absorb manners, and illustrate attitudes. In this Francis Bacon was a vital stimulus, and a number of works, notably <span class="italic">Digswell Man</span> (1959; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">All Night Long</span> (1964; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), are clearly Bacon-inspired. Yet Andrews, with his thorough Slade training, was more fastidious than impulsive. Unlike Bacon he deliberated exhaustively. He produced remarkably little, considering his application, and he rarely exhibited. His first one-man show was at Helen Lessore's Beaux Arts Gallery in 1958; his second was at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery in 1974. His first retrospective was organized by the Arts Council at the Hayward Gallery in 1980; his second was at Tate Britain in 2001, six years after his death.<br>
<br>In 1954 Andrews and the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi played the parts of deaf mute labourers in <span class="italic">Together</span>, a film directed by Lorenza Mazetti and shown at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. In it he and Paolozzi are adrift in decrepit dockland locations, alienated by handicap and susceptible to pathos. Andrews's character accidentally drowns in the Thames. In real life Andrews was stimulated by Soho life, centred on the Colony Room, a drinking club run by Muriel Belcher and frequented by Francis Bacon, both of whom, together with Lucian Freud and John Deakin, the photographer, feature in Andrews's <span class="italic">The Colony Room</span> (1962; Tate collection).<br>
<br>Film and photography constantly informed Andrews's work, as did poetry and fiction, indeed anything that could feed his concern with &#145;the apparent reality and the apparently real&#146;  (private information)&#151;not, he insisted, &#145;exactness of representation&#146; but heightened illusion. Party pictures such as <span class="italic">The Deer Park</span> (1962; Tate collection) led on to <span class="italic">Lights</span>, a sequence from the 1970s sparked by Rimbaud's <span class="italic">Illuminations</span>, involving balloon flight and views from on high of possible ideal landing sites (a pier, a beach); to <span class="italic">School</span>, a series from the late 1970s in which swimming fish replaced floating balloons as vehicles of Andrews's imagination; and <span class="italic">Holidays</span>, paintings of deerstalking in the Scottish highlands, an activity to which he, the scrupulous lapsed Methodist, came hesitantly but eventually with exhilaration, in that it became another powerful and unanticipated field of imagery for him.<br>
<br>Working on an expanding scale, using acrylic paint and a spray-gun for flawless effect, Andrews adopted Ayers Rock as a motif. He went to Australia to draw and photograph it in 1983 and worked on a series of big paintings, the first five of which were exhibited under the title <span class="italic">Rock of Ages Cleft for me</span> at the d'Offay Gallery in 1986. Mistaken for travel posters by some critics, the Ayers Rock series was Andrews's most ambitious venture into identification with a particular place. He regarded the rock as a spiritual lodestone of immense proportions. Landscapes of Norfolk (where he and his wife, June Keeley, and daughter, Melanie, born in 1970, lived from 1981 to 1992), the deer forest of Glenartney, in Perthshire, and a painting of Edinburgh Castle from the Grassmarket, grim in substance and tone, marked his growing concern with the layerings of associations in landscapes historic, fictional, pictorial. Finally, having moved to London in 1992 he embarked on a series of paintings of the Thames, two of which (<span class="italic">The Thames at Low Tide</span> and <span class="italic">Thames Painting: the Estuary</span>, both priv. coll.) he completed. A third, <span class="italic">Source of the Thames</span>, remained unfinished when on 19 July 1995, a year after an initial operation for cancer, he died at his home, 107 Albert Bridge Road. His ashes were interred at Glenartney on 18 August.<br>
<br>Though associated journalistically with the &#145;school of London&#146;, which notionally included Frank Auerbach, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, and Leon Kossoff, Michael Andrews was a painter of strong loyalties and allegiances who none the less went his own way. He was a brilliant synthesizer, absorbing influences, defining and securing with what he termed &#145;mysterious conventionality&#146;  (<span class="italic">X</span>, 1/2, March 1960, 141) images of poetic acuity and depth. &#145;Mike is so economical&#146;, Frank Auerbach once remarked. &#145;He only paints masterpieces&#146;  (Feaver, <span class="italic">Andrews: Lights</span>, 35).<br>
