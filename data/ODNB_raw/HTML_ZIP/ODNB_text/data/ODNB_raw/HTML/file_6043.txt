<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cumin <span class="st"> [Comyn]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1212), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin and royal servant</span>, may have come from a minor Somerset family. Certainly it is in connection with this county that his name first appears in the official records: in 1158 and 1159 John Cumin was pardoned debts in Somerset and excused from payments to the sheriffs of Somerset and Worcester.<h2>
<a name="Royalservice11631181"></a>Royal service, 1163&#150;1181</h2>In 1163 Cumin was present at the Council of Woodstock and witnessed a royal confirmation to the prior and convent of Burton Priory. It seems likely that by this date he had already been in the king's service for a number of years, as at the end of 1163 he represented Henry II at the court of Frederick Barbarossa, a task that would only have been performed by a skilled and trusted official.<br>
<br>Cumin's services were frequently used during the dispute between the king and the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket. In 1166 he was sent to Rome to request that papal legates be dispatched to England with powers to resolve the dispute. Later this same year he was rewarded with the archdeaconry of Bath, which Pope Alexander III ordered him to resign, as he had obtained the office through lay authority. However, he continued to hold the archdeaconry until at least 1174 and perhaps until 1182 when Peter of Blois was granted the office. The pipe rolls for 1169&#150;73 show that Cumin was active as an itinerant justice in the west country and also that he was custodian of the temporalities of Hereford from 1166 to 1172.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1170 Cumin was sent to Rome with the task of obtaining absolution from the pope for the archbishop of York and the bishops of London and Salisbury, who had been excommunicated by Thomas Becket. Cumin himself appears on a list of those excommunicated by Becket at about the same time. He was in the middle of negotiations when news of Becket's murder was brought to Italy. Cumin returned quickly to the king's side and was with Henry in Normandy in July 1171. Later in the same year he resumed his activities as an itinerant justice in England. During the following years Henry II continued to send him on diplomatic missions to France and Spain. At the Council of Windsor in 1179 he was appointed as a judge for northern England. In the years 1179&#150;81 he is frequently mentioned as being responsible for the transportation of the king's treasure, usually in the company of the chamberlain, although on one occasion he is himself called chamberlain.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofDublin11811196"></a>Archbishop of Dublin, 1181&#150;1196</h2>John Cumin held the prebend of Hoxton in St Paul's, London, but apart from this and the archdeaconry of Bath he does not seem to have achieved that accumulation of ecclesiastical benefices so characteristic of royal clerks of the time. He possessed only deacon's orders, and on the face of it his election to the archbishopric of Dublin in the abbey of Evesham in September 1181 was a spectacular promotion. It must be seen as primarily an affirmation of Henry II's belief in his abilities and trust in his loyalty. A key element in Cumin's preferment over other, possibly better qualified, candidates was his loyalty to the king during the Becket dispute. It was vital for the crown's policy in Ireland that the vacancy in the strategically important see of Dublin be filled by a trusted servant.<br>
<br>According to Gerald of Wales the representatives of the Dublin clergy who elected John Cumin at Evesham were &#145;reasonably united in their choice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 198&#150;9). The election did however take place in the presence of the king who clearly made his preference known. Cumin's movements immediately after the election are not known. As Pope Alexander III had died shortly before the Evesham election, it is likely that the archbishop-elect remained with the king in England until the election of Pope Lucius III was confirmed. Cumin then made his way to the new pope's court at Velletri, where he arrived in February 1182. He was ordained to the priesthood on 13 March and a week later was consecrated archbishop of Dublin by the pope.<br>
<br>Pope Lucius sent the new archbishop a very comprehensive confirmation of his lands and dignities. The document also included a detailed prohibition of certain abuses concerning the holding of ecclesiastical benefices and chaplaincies which were then apparently prevalent in the Dublin diocese. This prohibition indicates that Cumin had familiarized himself with practices in his new diocese, but it is not known if he obtained the information through a personal visit in the months after his election or through discussion with a well-informed source.<br>
<br>Cumin then returned to England and spent some time following the peregrinations of the royal court. His first securely recorded visit to his diocese came some years after his appointment, when in the autumn of 1184 he was dispatched to Ireland to prepare the way for John's forthcoming visit. He was present at Waterford in April 1185 to welcome John and it was in Waterford that the archbishop received his first grant of land from the prince. During the period in which he acted as John's adviser Cumin lost no opportunity to consolidate and extend the temporal possessions of his new diocese, which he appears to have considered rather small and poor. When John arrived in Dublin he granted to the archbishop the lands and possessions of the bishopric of Glendalough, on account of the smallness and poverty of the Dublin church.<h2>
<a name="Reformandembellishmentofhisarchdiocese"></a>Reform and embellishment of his archdiocese</h2>Cumin remained in Ireland after John's return and seriously began the work of administering his diocese and province. One of his first acts was to call a provincial council which opened in Christ Church, Dublin, on 30 March 1186. It was attended by the suffragan bishops and major religious superiors of the province and the opening sermon, on the church's sacraments, was given by the archbishop himself. The canons of the council are preserved in a confirmation of Pope Urban III dated 5 March 1187. Although they show many similarities with English statutes of the same period, they have a definite Irish tone and frequently refer to the Irish church and its special problems. The papal confirmation mentions the archbishop's concern that the people whom he was sent to govern were badly instructed in divine law, and it seems likely that the canons were for the most part Cumin's own work and reflect his pastoral concerns.<br>
<br>The archbishop did not, however, regard his presence in the diocese as essential for bringing about reform. Cumin left Dublin some time in 1186 and remained in England until 1190 when he attended the coronation of Richard I at Winchester. During this time he showed the same concern with augmenting the possessions and privileges of his see and received a series of charters and grants from John. Following the death of his patron Henry II the archbishop lessened his involvement with the royal court, and when he returned to his see in 1190 he devoted his energy to ecclesiastical administration.<br>
<br>In 1191 Cumin issued a charter concerning the elevation of the parish church of St Patrick to collegiate status. This church was situated on land that had been granted to him by John and it was here that the archbishop also began the building of the archiepiscopal palace of St Sepulchre. The consecration ceremony of St Patrick's took place on 17 March 1192 and was attended by the archbishops of Armagh and Cashel, as well as many other ecclesiastics. By founding a secular college Cumin provided Dublin with a convenient resource for the rewarding of royal clerics like himself, although some credence must also be given to his stated aim of desiring to improve the educational standards of the people of his diocese. It is not clear whether the archbishop intended that St Patrick's be elevated to cathedral status; his later, enforced absence from Dublin makes it difficult to reconstruct his motives. There is no evidence that he discriminated against the regular cathedral chapter of Holy Trinity, rather, in all ways he treated it as the cathedral church of his diocese. Furthermore he sponsored the extensive rebuilding of the cathedral which was carried out between 1186 and 1200, perhaps bringing over stone and workers from his native Somerset.<br>
<br>Most of the important acts of Cumin's episcopate can be dated to the years 1191&#150;6 when he maintained more or less constant residence in his diocese. Many of his activities were concerned with extending the temporal boundaries of his see or with ensuring that no other jurisdiction infringed upon it. Thus he took measures to lessen the control exercised by the bishop of Clogher over the Augustinian house of All Hallows, Dublin. He also cut the ties between the Augustinian convent of Gr&acirc;ce Dieu and its mother house of Clonard in the diocese of Meath by moving it to a new residence in Lusk and generously re-endowing it. During these years the archbishop also took further steps towards the unification of the dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough.<h2>
<a name="Exileandrestoration11971206"></a>Exile and restoration, 1197&#150;1206</h2>In 1197 the career of this loyal servant of the crown took an unexpected turn when he became embroiled in a serious dispute with Hamo de Valognes (<i>d</i>. 1202/3), the Irish justiciar, which resulted in his exile from Dublin for a period of nine years. The initial cause of the dispute is unclear, but it appears that dissension first arose over the question of royal forest rights in lands newly acquired by the archbishop. The agreement that was finally brokered in 1205 certainly refers to this issue. However, the dispute quickly escalated into a full-scale confrontation between the archbishop and the justiciar. Cumin threatened Valognes with ecclesiastical censure and he replied by confiscating some of the temporal possessions of the diocese. The archbishop then excommunicated Valognes and several of his officials and left for England having placed Dublin under interdict.<br>
<br>Cumin spent the next few years following the movements of the royal court, seeking unsuccessfully to have his grievances redressed. The situation worsened after the accession of King John in 1199, with the temporalities of Dublin being taken into the king's hand and the archbishop banned from the entire realm. Cumin then turned to Rome and found in Innocent III a determined champion of his rights. However it was not until 1205 that King John, faced with the threat of papal excommunication and interdict, gave way and agreed to restore to the archbishop his full liberties and temporal possessions. During his prolonged exile Cumin appears to have spent some time in Paris where Gerald of Wales recalls meeting him. Innocent III paints a colourful though perhaps exaggerated picture of the exile as a feeble old man forced to beg for his needs.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Given that John Cumin's career as a royal official can be traced from the 1150s he must have been fairly advanced in years when he returned to Dublin in 1206. The remaining six years of his episcopate passed without incident and he died in October 1212 &#145;senex et plenus dierum&#146;  (Gilbert, 2.279). He was buried in the church of Holy Trinity, whose monks had supported him in his battle with the crown. An early thirteenth-century effigy of an archbishop in St Lawrence's Chapel has been tentatively identified as that of John Cumin.<br>
<br>Gerald of Wales writes that John Cumin would have made outstanding improvements in the condition of the Irish church &#145;if his spiritual sword had not been continuously checked by the sword of the temporal power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 198&#150;9). There is a certain irony in the fact that a man who had so effectively advanced his career prospects by remaining faithful to the king during the Becket dispute should find himself, like Becket, exiled from his church and appealing to Rome for help, even if the liberties that Cumin so resolutely defended were related to the lands of his diocese rather than to the dignity of his episcopal office.<br>
<br>While Cumin's episcopate was certainly troubled and greatly occupied with temporal affairs, he did demonstrate a genuine concern for the spiritual well-being of his flock. The canons of the provincial council of 1186 display an awareness of and willingness to address the particular problems of the church in Ireland which had exercised the native reform party. He played a large part in the introduction of the complex machinery of Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical administration into the Dublin province, a process that was to be completed by his successors.<br>
