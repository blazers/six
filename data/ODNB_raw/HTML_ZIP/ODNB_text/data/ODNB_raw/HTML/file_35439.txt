<span class="headword">Pearson,  Alfred Chilton</span>  (1861&#150;1935), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at 23 Campden Hill Square, London, on 8 October 1861, the only child of Robert Henry Pearson (<i>d</i>. 1893), merchant, of London, and his wife, Georgina Boswood, who died when Pearson was still a schoolboy. He was educated at Highgate and King's College schools, and at Christ's College, Cambridge, which he entered as a scholar in 1879. He was fortunate in being taught by John Peile, soon to be university reader in comparative philology, who introduced Pearson to Sanskrit and gave him &#145;a solid foundation for the linguistic studies of later life&#146;  (Richards, 3). After obtaining a first class in both parts of the classical tripos (1881 and 1883) he read for the bar and was called by Lincoln's Inn in 1885; in the same year he married Edith Maud, fourth daughter of Reuben Green, solicitor and town clerk, of Kensington, and they settled in London.<br>
<br>In 1890 Pearson became a schoolmaster: after two years at Bury St Edmunds and one at Ipswich he passed in 1893 to Dulwich College, which he left in 1900, in order to enter his late father's London business, moving at the same time to Warlingham in Surrey. He joined the National Liberal Club, which gave him a base in London, and maintained his links with teaching by examining, from 1900, for the Oxford and Cambridge schools examination board.<br>
<br>Pearson's publications began in 1887 with a note on the <span class="italic">Androtion</span> of Demosthenes in the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, which had just begun, and to which he continued to contribute articles and reviews on many Greek subjects: his first book was <span class="italic">The Fragments of Zeno and Cleanthes</span> (1891), an admirable work which had won him the Hare prize at Cambridge two years before. All his later books were editions of works of the Greek tragedians, although between 1908 and 1921 he contributed more than twenty articles to Hastings's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</span>. He began with a series of school editions of Euripides (<span class="italic">Helena</span>, 1903; <span class="italic">Heraclidae</span>, 1907; <span class="italic">Phoenissae</span>, 1909) and with an abridgement (1907) of the <span class="italic">Ajax</span> of Sophocles edited by Sir Richard Jebb. Next, at the invitation of the syndics of the Cambridge University Press, he prepared for posthumous publication (1910) the verse translation and incomplete commentary on Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> left by W. G. Headlam, and also undertook the completion of the editing of the <span class="italic">Fragments</span> of Sophocles, a task begun by Jebb and continued by Headlam. Pearson spent several years on this difficult task, and in 1917 produced a masterly edition in three volumes, which established his reputation. The notes to this work ensure its lasting value to scholars.<br>
<br>In 1919 Pearson was elected Gladstone professor of Greek at Liverpool University, where he had the support of J. P. Postgate, professor of Latin. Pearson feigned surprise at his appointment: &#145;Rather a ridiculous adventure at my time of life! I did not even know the post was advertised&#146;  (Richards, 9). But he revitalized the department there and in 1921 succeeded Henry Jackson as regius professor of Greek at Cambridge, becoming thereupon a fellow of Trinity College. His chief remaining work was the Sophocles which he added to the <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span> series in 1924. Soon after this his health failed. He resigned his chair in 1928, and lived from 1932 to 1934 at Hunstanton before moving to London, where he died at his home, 61 Queen's Gate, Kensington, on 2 January 1935 after five years of total incapacity. His wife had died in 1930. They had a son and two daughters, the elder of whom predeceased her father.<br>
<br>Pearson was an active man, an oar and a cricketer in youth, and a keen golfer and walker in later life. Intensely loyal and generous, he combined deep modesty with strong opinions, carefully formed and not easily shaken. He did, though, resign his National Liberal Club membership and wrote in 1923 that, having ceased to be a Liberal, he expected &#145;to end as a crusted Tory&#146;  (Richards, 14). His scholarship was of a very high order, especially on the linguistic and grammatical side. All his books were models in their kind, and his masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Fragments of Sophocles</span>, shows a vast range of knowledge at the service of an acute and sober judgement. He was elected an honorary fellow of Christ's College in 1922 and a fellow of the British Academy in 1924.<br>
