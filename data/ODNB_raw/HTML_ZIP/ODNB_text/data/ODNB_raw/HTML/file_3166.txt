<span class="headword">Bradburn,  Samuel</span>  (1751&#150;1816), <span class="occ">Methodist minister</span>, was born in Gibraltar on 5 October 1751, the youngest son of the thirteen children of Isaac Bradburn (1719&#150;1794), a gardener turned army private, and his wife, a Mrs Bold (1722&#150;1775), the daughter of Samuel Jones, a Wrexham gardener. Samuel was apprenticed to a Chester shoemaker in 1764, and despite minimal schooling later acquired some knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. After a strict Anglican upbringing he indulged in drinking and gambling, with occasional attacks of conscience, until his conversion in 1769. After joining the Methodists in 1770 he became a travelling preacher in 1774. In 1779 he was accused of Arianism by Dr Thomas Coke but exonerated.<br>
<br>In the divisions after John Wesley's death over relations with the Church of England, Bradburn supported those wishing for Methodist ordinations and sacraments. His <span class="italic">The Question &#145;Are Methodists Dissenters?&#146; Fairly Examined</span> (1792) portrayed Methodism as not fully identifiable with Anglicanism or dissent, and free to shape its own ethos. Ordained by fellow Methodists in 1792, Bradburn alienated &#145;Church Methodists&#146; in Bristol that year and supported the Lichfield plan (1794) for a quasi-episcopal Methodist government. He was suspected of &#145;democratical&#146; sentiments, though his &#145;Rights of Man&#146; language was mainly applied to religious toleration and Methodist lay rights. From 1795, however, alarmed by government threats against Methodism, he attacked the radical Methodists led by Alexander Kilham. He was president of the Methodist conference for 1799&#150;1800, but was suspended from the ministry during 1802&#150;3, apparently for drunkenness, possibly aggravated by chronic inability to keep out of debt.<br>
<br>Bradburn published only a few pamphlets and sermons, and an account of John Wesley's character (1791). Despite his popularity as a leading preacher (&#145;the Methodist Demosthenes&#146;; Stevens, 1.125) Bradburn attracted criticism for being unduly witty, satirical, and eccentric in and out of the pulpit, though he was careful of his appearance and powdered his wig. Despite these shortcomings he was a favourite of Wesley's, who engineered his first marriage on 28 June 1778 to Elizabeth Nangle of Dublin (1755/1757&#150;1786), persuading her guardians to consent and marrying the couple forthwith in their parlour. (Praying for guidance about marriage Bradburn added &#145;But, O Lord, let it be Betsy&#146;.) On 10 August 1786 he married Sophia Cooke (1758/9&#150;1834), daughter of a Gloucester surgeon. Of his six sons, and either one or two daughters, only a daughter survived him. Bradburn's last years were clouded by physical and mental illness. He died in Long Lane, Southwark, on 26 July 1816 and was buried near Wesley's tomb in the New Chapel burial-ground, City Road, London on 2 August 1816. He was survived by his second wife, who died on 16 March 1834.<br>
