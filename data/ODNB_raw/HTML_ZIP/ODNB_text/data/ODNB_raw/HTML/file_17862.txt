<span class="headword">Malcolm, Sir  George</span>  (1818&#150;1897), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Bombay on 10 September 1818, was the only son of David Malcolm (<i>d</i>. 1826), a Bombay merchant (brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17865/', "Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17864/', "General Sir John Malcolm")</script>), and his first wife, Maria Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1818). He attended Addiscombe College from 1835 to 1836, and was commissioned ensign in the East India Company's service on 10 June 1836, being posted to the 1st Bombay native infantry (Bombay Grenadiers) on 18 July 1837. He served in the Anglo-Afghan War of 1839 as deputy assistant commissary-general and baggage master with the Bombay division, and was present at the capture of Ghazni and occupation of Kabul. In August 1840, at the head of a detachment of Sind horse, he joined the force sent under Major Clibborn to relieve Kahun in Baluchistan, took part in the attempt to force the Nafusk Pass, and was mentioned in dispatches for his gallantry. He was also engaged in the operations against Nasir Khan and the Brahoes and the capture of their camp near Kanda on 1 December.<br>
<br>Malcolm became lieutenant on 31 August 1840. He served under Colonel John Jacob during the subjugation of Sind, and was at the battle of Shahdadpur and the capture of Shahpur. In the Second Anglo-Sikh War he commanded the 2nd Sind horse, and was present at the siege of Multan and the battle of Gujrat. He was mentioned in dispatches, and on becoming captain in his regiment was given a brevet majority on 22 June 1849. He became lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1854.<br>
<br>On 19 October 1852 Malcolm married Wilhelmina Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 13 Dec 1911), youngest daughter of the Revd Henry Alright Hughes, and they had four sons. He served in the Anglo-Persian War of 1856&#150;7, and commanded a small field force during the Indian mutiny. On 29 November 1857 he stormed the fortified village of Halgalli, took possession of Shorapur on 9 February 1858, and on 2 June captured the fort of Nargund, the strongest in the south Maratha country. He was mentioned in dispatches and was made CB on 21 March 1859. He became colonel in the army on 30 August 1860 and major-general on 15 December 1867. In the expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 he commanded the 2nd division, which guarded the line of communications. He was made KCB on 14 August 1868. In the same year he printed for private circulation at Karachi a short pamphlet, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Indian Army</span>, arguing the danger of relying on European troops and of discrediting the native army, as had been the tendency since the mutiny. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 29 May 1875 and general on 1 October 1877, and was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list on 1 July 1881. He received the GCB on 29 May 1886. Malcolm died at his home, Guy's Dale, Leamington, Warwickshire, on 6 April 1897.<br>
