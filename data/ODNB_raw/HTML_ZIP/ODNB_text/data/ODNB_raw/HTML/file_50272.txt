<span class="headword">Koch de Gooreynd <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Koch]</span>,  William Julien Maurice</span>  (1853&#150;1919), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 14 October 1853, the second son of Franciscus Josephus Koch (<i>b</i>. 1815) and Josephine Emile de Laska of Belgium. He settled in Britain, probably at Brighton, some time prior to 1877. In that year he joined the London stockbrokers Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. which had been formed a year earlier by Harry Panmure Gordon. Koch took British citizenship on 28 July 1883 and about 1913 added de Gooreynd to his surname by special permission of Leopold II who, it is said, would have ennobled Koch on account of his services to Belgium had he not already assumed British citizenship. Under Gordon's flamboyant leadership Panmure Gordon became well known, but Willy Koch made the key contribution; &#145;he was the brains of the firm&#146;, wrote the company promoter H. Osborne O'Hagan in 1929, &#145;although for many years Panmure Gordon was the dominating person and his partners did not much figure&#146;  (O'Hagan, 1.368). Koch was admitted a partner in 1889 and became senior partner in 1902, following the death of Gordon and the resignation of others.<br>
<br>Koch built Panmure Gordon into London's leading broking house for foreign government loans in the two decades before the First World War, when issues boomed and fortunes were made. In 1906 the leading merchant bankers, Morgan Grenfell, were &#145;impressed with the way Panmure Gordon's do their business now &hellip; they are intelligent and their methods are more sound than in the days of old PG&#146;; a year later they believed the firm to be &#145;probably the most important firm in London&#146;  (Kynaston, <span class="italic">The City of London</span>, 310). Panmures specialized in foreign loans for sovereign states. The firm was especially pre-eminent as brokers for Chinese and Japanese government bond issues and worked closely with leading houses such as the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Barings; by 1914 twelve Chinese government and railway loans, worth &pound;40 million, and thirteen Japanese government issues, exceeding &pound;100 million, had been sponsored. The large and important Japanese issues negotiated with Baron Takahashi and marketed on continental and American bourses for the first time during the Russo-Japanese War were of particular note.<br>
<br>Koch's firm acted as brokers to a wide range of issues&#151;from those of the city of Moscow to the Ottoman government, and from the state of S&atilde;o Paulo to the Union Pacific Railway. Industrial issues figured less, but Panmures' clients included many breweries, and weighty names such as Liptons Tea and Shell Transport and Trading. Apparently it had a weakness for foreign industrials, and anything outside the ordinary which it was &#145;quite unable to underwrite&#146;, according to the leading banker, Emile D'Erlanger  (Kynaston, <span class="italic">The City of London</span>, 310). Notwithstanding, at the negotiating table Koch equalled the bankers&#151;thereby enjoying a prestige rarely given to his profession&#151;and offered a priceless combination of unrivalled placing power, coupled, when needed, with discretion. For example, he courted Lord Revelstoke, the imperious head of Barings, before the banker left to negotiate with the Russian government for an issue of imperial bonds in 1905. &#145;Should it be any &#147;comfort&#148; to you to syndicate 5,000,000 before you go St Petersburg&#146;, he counselled the banker, &#145;I think that this could be done quietly, and privately so to speak, without much fear of indiscretion&#146;  (ING Baring archives, 200243). This was placing power indeed.<br>
<br>Koch also figured in the affairs of the stock exchange, where he sat for a considerable time on the general purposes committee. His moment came in August 1914 when, with the markets on the threshold of collapse, he &#145;was one of the most indefatigable minds in saving the situation by getting the House closed and a moratorium established and later in assisting the Treasury and the City Financial Committee to formulate a scheme for the reopening&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Koch's lifestyle was opulent and, unusually for a broker, rivalled those of London's merchant bankers. His London home from about 1907 was 1 Belgrave Square, where footmen wore knee-breeches and black satin and where clients were lavishly entertained. &#145;Grand affair&#146;, wrote the banker Charles Addis after one such occasion in 1908; &#145;12 guests and 6 serving men. Moet 93. Well done and less boring than usual&#146;  (Kynaston, <span class="italic">The City of London</span>, 331). Koch's Belgian links were also maintained. From at least 1910 he owned an estate at Gooreynd, near Antwerp, which he visited frequently, and during the First World War he worked for charities supporting Belgian refugees. Having a white beard, blue eyes, and a short, stocky build, he bore a striking resemblance to Edward VII, with whom he was frequently confused when taking the cure at Karlsbad. He had a passion for music and artists such as Jan Paderewski and Jelly D'Ar&aacute;nyi were regularly invited to play at his Belgrave Square home.<br>
<br>On 10 September 1891 Koch married Manuela Joanna Joaquima Maria (<i>d</i>. 1936), a Polish cousin and daughter and coheir of Alexandre de Laski of London and Paris and sometime governor of the Bank of Poland. They had three sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Alexander, changed his surname by deed poll to Worsthorne although in 1937 reverted to Koch de Gooreynd; a grandson was the newspaper editor and journalist Sir Peregrine Worsthorne. His second son, Gerald, succeeded him at Panmures and was a partner there from 1924 until his death in 1953. William Koch died at his London home on 6 February 1919, leaving an estate in Britain of &pound;0.75 million. His funeral on the 10th, presided over by a bishop, took place at the Roman Catholic cathedral, Westminster.<br>
