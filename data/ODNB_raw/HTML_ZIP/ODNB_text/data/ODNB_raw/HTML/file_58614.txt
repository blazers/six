<span class="headword">Czira <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gifford]</span>,  Sidney</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Brennan]</span>  (1889&#150;1974), <span class="occ">journalist and Irish republican activist</span>, was born at 8 Temple Villas, Palmerston Road, Rathmines, Dublin, on 3 August 1889, the youngest daughter and youngest of the twelve children (six boys and six girls) of Frederick Gifford (<i>d</i>. 1917), solicitor, and his wife, Isabella Julia Burton (<i>d</i>. 1932). The boys were raised as Catholics, the religion of their father, while the girls were raised as protestants, the religion of their mother. Both parents were unionist in their politics. Sidney was educated at Alexandra School and College, Dublin, and took music lessons in the Leinster School of Music. She is incorrectly reputed to have written for Arthur Griffith's newspaper <span class="italic">Sinn F&eacute;in</span> from the age of sixteen: her first published article did not appear until May 1908. The Gifford sisters were well-known activists in nationalist circles: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59681/', "Grace Gifford")</script>, a gifted artist and caricaturist, married the poet Joseph Mary Plunkett, one of the leaders of the 1916 rising, hours before his execution; Muriel Gifford married the poet Thomas MacDonagh, who was also executed for his part in the rising.<br>
<br>In 1908 Sidney Gifford joined the women's nationalist organization Inghinidhe na hEireann, was active in the suffrage cause through her work in the Irish Women's Franchise League, and was elected to the executive council of Sinn F&eacute;in in 1911 and 1912. She published a number of articles in <span class="italic">Bean na hEireann</span>, the journal of Inghinidhe na hEireann, and in the <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span>, the suffrage paper. She was employed as a journalist for <span class="italic">Irish Freedom</span> from 1910 to 1914. Gifford travelled to the United States in June 1914 in an attempt to make a career in journalism. She published articles in the <span class="italic">New York Sun</span>, the <span class="italic">Irish World</span>, and the <span class="italic">Irish Press</span> in Philadelphia. She also became involved in propaganda work and collecting money for the cause of Irish nationalism. She worked with Clan na nGael and the Irish Progressive League, and organized a branch of Cumann na mBan in New York.<br>
<br>In America Sidney Gifford married a Hungarian &eacute;migr&eacute;, Arpad Czira, in 1916. The couple had a son, Finian, born in 1917, but they separated soon after. She had attempted to go back to Ireland in 1916 but the British authorities prevented her return. She finally arrived in Ireland in 1922 under a false passport. She found it difficult to find work in Ireland in the 1920s, but contributed to a number of newspapers and journals on a freelance basis. Her work was published in the <span class="italic">Irish Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Kerryman</span>, the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span>, and particularly in <span class="italic">An Phoblacht</span>. She also found work with the new Irish broadcasting station 2RN. In 1927, having published a letter in the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> castigating an Irish senator for commenting on the shooting of Kevin O'Higgins and prejudicing the case of the men accused of the crime, she was told she would be offered no more work with the station. She was not re-employed in broadcasting until 1932. She remained politically active and was involved with the Women's Prisoners Defence League and in the 1930s was prominent in the anti-Blueshirts protests and in the Indian-Irish Independence League, established in 1932.<br>
<br>After the Second World War Czira engaged in work with German refugee children, 400 of whom she placed in homes around Ireland. She also began, with her son Finian, her own newspaper, <span class="italic">News and Views</span>, published between 1942 and 1949, essentially a news-sheet which reprinted news items from different countries. She was a successful radio broadcaster from the 1950s, presenting programmes on Irish history and music. She appeared in a number of television programmes in Ireland from 1961. A collection of her articles and reminiscences was published as <span class="italic">The Years Flew By</span> (1974). She appears to have been a difficult person to work with, one commentator noting that she could be &#145;explosively irate&#146; and that her &#145;displeasure was deadly&#146; (quoted in <span class="italic">The Years Flew By</span>, 2000, xlv). She died in Dublin on 15 September 1974.<br>
