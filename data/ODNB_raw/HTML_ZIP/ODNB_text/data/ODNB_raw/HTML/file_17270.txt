<span class="headword">Lynn,  Thomas</span>  (1774&#150;1847), <span class="occ">naval officer in the East India Company and teacher of navigation</span>, was born on 2 January 1774 at Woodbridge, Suffolk, one of at least two sons of James Lynn, a medical practitioner, and his wife, Elizabeth. In order to be accepted into the navy of the East India Company, Thomas and his brother John were provided with fraudulent baptismal certificates indicating that they were three years older than they actually were; Thomas was only eleven when he was taken on the books of the East India Company's <i>Valentine</i> as captain's servant in 1785. In due course he rose through the ranks, and made several voyages to the West Indies, then to the East Indies and China. He was serving as first mate by 1798, and his last voyage was to China as captain of the <i>Barkworth</i>, in 1816&#150;17.<br>
<br>Lynn was then appointed examiner in nautical astronomy to the East India Company's officers. He was based at 34 Trinity Square, Tower Hill, where he may have resided with his daughter, Mary Emma (probably born soon after he settled in London), and at 148 Leadenhall Street, in the City of London, the latter being well known to mariners as it was adjacent to East India House and occupied by a succession of scientific and nautical instrument makers. Lynn also advertised that he would instruct Royal Navy officers and supply instruments and chronometers. He published sets of star tables and pamphlets on telegraphic communication and practical navigation, and contributed a detailed chapter on the various routes to and from Chinese ports to the three-volume work on China in the <span class="roman">Edinburgh Cabinet Library</span> series issued in 1836.<br>
<br>By 1836, however, Lynn's income was inadequate and he was obliged to dispose of his publications and sell his copyrights. He and Mary Emma moved to 1 Marine Terrace, East Cliff, Dover, where he died on 2 May 1847. Mary Emma inherited less than &pound;300; her appeal to the East India Company for a portion of her father's pension was refused.<br>
