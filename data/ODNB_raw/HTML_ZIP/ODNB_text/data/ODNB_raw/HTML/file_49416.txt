<span class="headword">Spearhafoc</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1047&#150;1051), <span class="occ">abbot of Abingdon and craftsman</span>, is first recorded as a monk of Bury St Edmunds. His name, meaning &#145;sparrowhawk&#146;, also occurs in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> in Suffolk and Nottinghamshire and may represent Anglo-Scandinavian usage. It was almost certainly a byname, even though no other name is recorded for him; perhaps it refers to the craftsman's sharp eyes.<br>
<br>About 1047 Edward the Confessor made Spearhafoc abbot of Abingdon. The Abingdon chronicle implies that he bribed the worldly Bishop Stigand to further his cause with the king; at all events Edward appointed him to the bishopric of London in 1051. He was, however, disapproved of by Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges, Edward's new archbishop of Canterbury, who had just returned from Rome with his pallium. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> E text recounts that Spearhafoc met Robert<blockquote>with the king's writ and seal to the effect that he was to be consecrated bishop of London by the archbishop. But the archbishop refused and said that the pope had forbidden it him. Then the abbot went to the archbishop again about it and asked for ordination as bishop, and the archbishop refused him resolutely and said that the pope had forbidden it him. Then the abbot went back to London and occupied the bishopric that the king had given him; he did this with the king's full permission all that summer and autumn. (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1048, <i>recte</i> 1051, text E)</blockquote>In the autumn of 1051, immediately after he had banished the rebellious Godwine family, Edward expelled Spearhafoc from the bishopric; Spearhafoc left the country, never to be seen again.<br>
<br>As abbot and bishop Spearhafoc epitomizes the faults of the late Anglo-Saxon church, but as craftsman he is of much interest. Goscelin of St Bertin calls him &#145;an exceptional artist outstanding in painting, gold-engraving and goldsmithing&#146;, and describes events when Spearhafoc was working at Canterbury at Abbot &AElig;lfstan's request (that is, before 1046): as a thank-offering for the miraculous recovery of a precious ring belonging to Queen Eadgyth, he made images &#145;of enormous size and beauty&#146; of Bishop Liudhard and Queen Bertha  (Goscelin, col. 46). It was remembered at Abingdon that he was &#145;a marvellous worker in the fashioning of gold and silver&#146;, and that in 1051 he absconded with a great store of gold and gems which the king had given him to make an &#145;imperial crown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon monasterii de Abingdon</span>, 1.462&#150;3). It may be that Spearhafoc, like Mannig, abbot of Evesham, supervised a goldsmithing workshop based in his abbey: Abingdon tenants in Edward the Confessor's time included Leofwine <i>aurifaber</i> or &#145;goldsmith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 1.58<i>v</i>). The careers of Spearhafoc and Mannig show that manual skills were esteemed in even the highest-ranking late Anglo-Saxon churchmen, and indeed were a means to advancement: in Spearhafoc's case there is no record of any other qualities that might have commended him to the king.<br>
