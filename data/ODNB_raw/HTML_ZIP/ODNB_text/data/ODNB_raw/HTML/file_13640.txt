<span class="headword">Home,  Francis</span>  (1719&#150;1813), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 9 November 1719, the second son of James Home, an advocate of Eccles, Berwickshire, and Jean Kinloch. Home's early schooling was in Duns with the respected classical scholar and teacher Mr Cruickshanks, who instilled in his pupil the love of classical literature and skill in Latin that remained with him throughout his life. After this early schooling he was apprenticed to Mr Rattray, an eminent Edinburgh surgeon. Next came studies at the new medical faculty of the University of Edinburgh, where he was an early member of the influential Royal Medical Society. However, before graduating he became a surgeon with the 6th Inniskilling regiment of dragoons and served with them in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession. During the campaign Home drew up regimental orders for the prevention of fevers, which stated that the soldiers should not drink water unless it had been boiled. He used the winter campaign breaks to attend Leiden medical school (popular with Scots wishing to study medicine) and still flourishing in this period twelve years after Herman Boerhaave's death.<br>
<br>After the war Home settled in Edinburgh, where he finally graduated MD from the university in 1750. He put his army experience to good use by incorporating medical data on the remittent fevers (malaria) collected while tending troops at Worms into his inaugural dissertation, <span class="italic">De febre remittente</span>. The next twenty years were very productive and Home's interests ranged widely. In 1751 he published an essay on the chemical properties of &#145;Dunse Spa&#146; (Duns), proposing that the waters had an anthelminthic effect. The year 1751 also saw Home becoming a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and starting to build up his medical practice. In 1758 an Edinburgh measles epidemic prompted him to experiment with the use of a measles vaccine. In <span class="italic">Medical Facts and Experiments</span> (1759) he stated &#145;I should do no small service to mankind if I could render this disease more mild and safe in the same way as the Turks have taught us to mitigate the small-pox&#146;. Home took blood from the cutaneous veins found among the measle spots of his most feverish patients and tried it out on both children with measles and those without. He concluded that the inoculated patients had milder cases of measles. He also published important observations on diphtheria in the first clinical description of croup, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature, Cause and Cure of the Croup</span> (1765). This publication detailed the development of laryngeal and tracheal involvement in the disease. Home described the &#145;white, soft, thick prenatural coat or membrane&#146; lining the upper respiratory tract and vividly observed that it lay loose, resembling the &#145;blankets of a bed that has been lain in&#146;  (pp. 16&#150;19). He suggested that tracheotomy should be used in desperate cases.<br>
<br>In 1756 Home turned his attention to chemistry and in <span class="italic">Experiments on Bleaching</span> recommended that bleachers should use dilute sulphuric acid instead of sour milk. This publication greatly increased the profitability of bleaching and the Honourable Board of Trustees for the Improvement of Manufactures in North Britain paid him &pound;100 and presented him with a gold medal. In 1757 it was agriculture that benefited from his research. In his book <span class="italic">The Principles of Agriculture and Vegetation</span> he applied chemistry to farming, describing the growth of plants potted in soils treated with compounds like magnesium sulphate and potassium nitrate. He also showed that plants gain nutrition from air.<br>
<br>Home was not neglecting medicine and in 1758 he published the first edition of his scientific history of disease, <span class="italic">Principia medicinae</span>, which included a description of his discovery that yeast ferments diabetic urine. <span class="italic">Principia medicinae</span> increased his reputation&#151;especially in Europe and America, where the publication was widely used as a textbook. It went through several editions and was still consulted well into the nineteenth century. In 1768 Home obtained the first professorship of materia medica in the University of Edinburgh. The subject had previously been studied as a subset of botany. To meet the student need for a syllabus of drugs Home published in 1770 <span class="italic">Methodus materia medicae</span> based on his lecture notes. During this period Edinburgh University had an official relationship with the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (established in 1756) and Home was one of the professors responsible for patient care and bedside teaching in its teaching ward. Clinical observation was always one of his interests and he promoted the methodology for history taking and physical examination formulated by the medical faculty. He stated that &#145;many symptoms cannot be described by the patient himself, these we must discover by our senses&#146;  (&#145;Clinical lectures&#146;, 8). The publication of a course of clinical lectures in 1780, <span class="italic">Clinical Experiments Histories and Dissections</span>, rounded off his publishing career.<br>
<br>Home was one of his majesty's physicians in Scotland and he followed William Cullen as president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1775 to 1777. During his presidency he oversaw the problematic construction of the college's George Street Hall, designed by James Craig. In 1798 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13645/', "James Home")</script> succeeded his father, becoming the second professor of materia medica. Francis himself lived for another fourteen years. Contemporary statements and the evidence of his manuscript cashbook suggest that he was mentally active until within a short period of his death on 15 February 1813 in his ninety-fourth year. He was buried at Earlston, Berwickshire.<br>
<br>Francis Home was in many ways the quintessential establishment Scottish Enlightenment physician, whose long life spanned the period when Edinburgh medicine was at its most influential.<br>
