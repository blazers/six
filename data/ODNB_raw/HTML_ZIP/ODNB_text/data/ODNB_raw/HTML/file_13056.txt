<span class="headword">Herbert, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1593), <span class="occ">colonist in Ireland and author</span>, was born about 1553 at St Julians, Monmouthshire, the only child of William Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1567), landowner, of St Julians, and his first wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1554), daughter and heir of Edward Griffith of Penrhyn, Caernarvonshire. He was the great-grandson of Sir George Herbert, third son of William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke (<i>c</i>.1423&#150;1469), a pedigree upon which he placed considerable emphasis. Herbert was, in fact, the earl's only surviving legitimate male heir. Between about 1568 and 1573 he attended Oxford, where he received private instruction from Laurence Humphrey, president of Magdalen College and an ardent protestant, quickly earning himself a reputation as a poet and intellectual. The poet Thomas Churchyard dedicated &#145;Churchyard's Dream&#146;, the ninth labour of &#145;the first part of Churchyard's Chippes&#146;, to Herbert in 1575 while the astrologer and mathematician John Dee gladly accepted the young man's notes on his astrological and alchemical work <span class="italic">Monos hieroglyphica</span> in May 1577. About this time Herbert married Florence (<i>d</i>. in or after 1596), daughter of William Morgan of Llantornan, Monmouthshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. They had two sons who died young&#151;reputedly from consuming poison left in Herbert's library to protect his precious books from rats. In 1578 Florence gave birth to their only surviving child, Mary Herbert (1578&#150;1634).<br>
<br>Herbert first entered political life as sheriff of Glamorgan from 1577 to 1578 and, in an effort to consolidate his position further, leased Newport Castle and then Liswerry and Lebenith manors. He was knighted by Elizabeth I at Richmond Palace on 21 December 1578 and was appointed deputy constable of Conwy Castle, Caernarvonshire, in 1579. In 1579 or 1580 he was named JP for Monmouthshire; he served as sheriff of the county from 1579 to 1580 and was, in 1583, appointed chief steward of Rhymni manor in south Wales. He was appointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Monmouthshire by 1583. Yet political advancement did not diminish Herbert's intellectual pursuits. He regularly visited Dee, who was his neighbour at Mortlake, Surrey, and undoubtedly availed himself of the large library Dee kept there. Herbert maintained an interest in astrology and alchemy and in early 1582 Dee's alchemical assistant requested to live with him. This seamless combination of the disparate roles of intellectual, country gentleman, and political servant distinguished him from many other Welsh MPs when he sat for Monmouthshire in the parliaments of 1584 and 1586. In the former, Herbert was on nine committees dealing with a wide range of political matters; in the latter he introduced a bill concerning orphans in Monmouthshire and delivered what was the first recorded speech by a Welsh MP. It concerned Mary, queen of Scots, and he was consequently chosen, with forty-five others, to present Elizabeth with a petition calling for her cousin's execution. Shortly afterwards, however, in a dramatic departure from his hitherto Welsh-based endeavours, Herbert embarked on a colonization venture in Ireland.<br>
<br>In May 1586 Herbert undertook, with a consortium, to plant areas of Munster which had come into the crown's hands following the attainder of Gerald Fitzjames Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond. The catalyst for the undertaking may have been <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6719/', "Sir James Croft")</script>, Herbert's distant relation and former lord deputy of Ireland, but he was certainly alive to the opportunities available across the Irish Sea. In addition to the possibility of financial gain, Ireland presented an intellectual and a religious challenge to which he could devote himself. In June 1586 Herbert applied for three &#145;seignories&#146; in co. Kerry, amounting to roughly 24,000 acres, but their allotment was delayed for nearly a year while the lands were surveyed. During this time he displayed his protestant convictions by composing <span class="italic">A letter written by a true Christian catholike to a Romaine pretended catholike, upon occasion of a controversie touching the catholike churche</span> (1586). This was followed in 1587 by a work, no longer extant, in praise of Sir Philip Sidney entitled <span class="italic">Sidney, or, Baripenthes: briefely shadowing out the rare and never ending landes of that most honourable and praiseworthy gent. Sir Philip Sidney</span>. Herbert finally arrived in Cork in April 1587, but received just 13,276 acres at Castleisland, co. Kerry.<br>
<br>On paper, the colonization scheme was promising: the plantations were to represent English islands of stability and civility inhabited and inexpensively defended by settlers drawn from those English counties where the colonists wielded influence. However, they inherited a myriad of rents and exactions previously due to Desmond, which were now due, in part, to the crown. These rents had been levied without any regularity and the land on which they were due was depopulated and wasted. Herbert identified the problem, noting a:<blockquote>continual vexation and disquietness between the undertakers and the natural inhabitants of the country, upon whom these things must be levied, but cannot be had, because they have not wherewith to pay it; the other an incumbrance to the gentleman whose lands both in England and Ireland shall stand charged in the Exchequer for these sums, which they shall never be able to levy. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/135/58)</blockquote>Dissension quickly arose among the colonists as they quarrelled over the boundaries of their lands and the retention of tenants. Herbert became embroiled in a particularly bitter dispute with Sir Edward Denny, who alleged that he had lured away some of his tenants.<br>
<br>The settlers had a proclivity to drift towards better land in co. Limerick and Herbert became increasingly reliant on enticing neighbouring settlers onto his lands and utilizing the existing Irish population. This latter development, coupled with his knowledge of the success of Tudor reform in Wales, had a profound influence on his treatment of the Irish and contrasted sharply with that of his colleagues. He found the Irish to be tractable enough, lacking only the &#145;sweet taste of civility&#146;. He insisted that prayers be said in Gaelic and that the Lord's prayer and the ten commandments be translated for their benefit. Herbert's principal goal was doubtless their conversion to protestantism, but his unexpected and unpopular effort to procure the release from Dublin Castle in March 1588 of the noted rebel Patrick Fitzmaurice&#151;a member of the Old English contingent long settled in Munster&#151;reflected his willingness to put native concerns ahead of New English interests to achieve &#145;stability and civility&#146;. In doing so, however, he alienated many of his colleagues and was accused of being contaminated by the Irish, to which he responded:<blockquote>though I have ever more esteemed of the nobility of virtue, yet have I little cause to think myself blemished by my blood being the heir male of that Earl [Pembroke] that hath this day living nine earls and barons descended out of his body. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/135/81(i))</blockquote>The dispute with Denny and his fellow undertakers worsened and by December 1588 quarter sessions were being disrupted. Herbert positioned himself to return home, but this was delayed while he acted as vice-president in Munster during Sir Thomas Norris's absence. Though his departure was imminent, he still held out the hope of making &#145;Kerry and Desmond a little England beyond Ireland&#146; just as &#145;some worthy gentlemen in times past [had] made Pembrokeshire a little England beyond Wales&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/140/11). He wrote copiously on the state of Munster with prescriptions for its reform. Having served successively as JP and sheriff in co. Kerry and also as a member of the provincial council, Herbert returned to Wales in early summer 1589 with commendatory letters from leading Irish officials.<br>
<br>In the months following his return Herbert spoke at length with Croft about his experiences in Ireland. Croft died on 4 September 1590, but their conversations formed the basis for Herbert's lengthy treatise <span class="italic">Croftus, sive, De Hibernia liber</span>. Completed in early 1591, the work represents a collection of views formed by Croft during his deputyship, but modified and updated by Herbert's recent firsthand colonial experience in Ireland. The main thrust of <span class="italic">Croftus</span> is its belief that the colonization of Munster would succeed in introducing &#145;English civility&#146; to the natives. Support was found for this argument among classical texts&#151;Cicero in particular&#151;or the scriptures; passages were highlighted which advocated colonization schemes to &#145;civilize&#146; &#145;primitive&#146; peoples. &#145;Civilizing&#146; the natives, however, could not be achieved without the abolition of native customs, which <span class="italic">Croftus</span> held to be the greatest threat to the colonists:<blockquote>colonies degenerate assuredly when the colonists imitate and embrace the habits, customs and practices of the natives. There is no better way to remedy this evil than to do away with and destroy completely the habits and practices of the natives. (<span class="italic">Croftus</span>, 81)</blockquote>The introduction of protestantism and of education&#151;the latter facilitated by the establishment of universities at Dublin and Limerick&#151;would combine to draw the natives from their customs and ensure their Anglicization. Yet <span class="italic">Croftus</span>, while offering a window into the intellectual arguments concerning Tudor plantation schemes in Ireland, also served as a detailed piece of propaganda justifying the settlement of Ireland by New English officials. It set the tone for writings on the subject and was followed by works from two other colonists, Richard Beacon and Sir Edmund Spenser respectively, advocating similar colonization, although it reflected the more reasonable colonial mindset more fully than Spenser's work did.<br>
<br>In the years following his return to Wales, Herbert's energies and writings were not confined to the subject of Ireland. He attempted unsuccessfully to secure a seat on the queen's council in the marches of Wales, but was returned for parliament, again for Monmouthshire, in January 1593. Perhaps his experiences in Ireland explain his appointment as deputy lieutenant of Monmouthshire by 1593, but he was more than qualified for office by his local consequence. He wrote a love poem first published in the <span class="italic">Phoenix Nest</span> in 1593 (Park, vol. 2) and replied to Edmund Campion's <span class="italic">Decem rationes</span> (1587) in a work entitled <span class="italic">Sir William Herbert's confutation of Campion the Jesuit's ten reasons dedicated to Queen Elizabeth</span>. He also penned an aggressive letter to one Morgan who foolishly issued him a challenge. Herbert died on 4 March 1593, at St Julians, Monmouthshire, and was buried in Monmouth; he was survived by his wife and daughter. In his will (dated 12 April 1587) he bequeathed all his estates, including lands in Ireland, to his daughter, Mary. In an effort to ensure that his descendants would share both his blood and surname he inserted a clause requiring her to marry someone surnamed Herbert. If, however, the clause was ignored she would inherit a meagre living from a small portion of his lands in Anglesey and Caernarvonshire. In February 1599 she fulfilled this condition, marrying <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13020/', "Edward Herbert, later first Baron Herbert of Cherbury (1582?&#150;1648)")</script>. At the instigation of Sir William Herbert's widow and daughter a new survey of his Irish lands was conducted, and the rent was reduced in 1596. Throughout his career he was convinced of the benefits of Tudor government and worked tirelessly towards its implementation in Wales. His efforts to put Tudor theories of government into practice in Ireland, however, were less successful and his house and possessions were ultimately swept away by rebellion in 1598. <span class="italic">Croftus</span>, his greatest legacy, which continued to influence English colonial thought about Ireland for a decade, was in many ways an intellectual attempt to achieve Tudor reform in Ireland where his plantation had failed.<br>
