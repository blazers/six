<span class="headword">Ware, Sir  James</span>  (1594&#150;1666), <span class="occ">antiquary and historian</span>, was born on 26 November 1594 in Castle Street, Dublin, the eldest son of Sir James Ware (<i>d</i>. 1632), and his wife, Mary Briden. His father had gone to Ireland as secretary to Sir William FitzWilliam, the lord deputy, in 1588; he became auditor-general, was knighted by James I, and was elected MP for Mallow in the Irish parliament of 1613. James Ware entered the recently founded Trinity College, Dublin, in 1610, graduating MA in 1616. While there, he encountered James Ussher, who encouraged him to take an interest in antiquarian matters. Shortly after leaving the university, about 1617, he married Mary, the daughter of John Newman of Dublin. Ware began to collect manuscripts and charters that had a bearing on Irish history, and developed an acquaintance with Irish scholars, one of whom, Duald MacFirbis (Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisig), proved particularly helpful to him. His first publication was <span class="italic">Archiepiscoporum Casseliensem et Tuamensium vitae</span> (1628), the lives of the archbishops of Cashel and Tuam. He went to England for the first time in 1629, and undertook research in several libraries.<br>
<br>In 1629 Ware was knighted, and in 1632, after the death of his father, he succeeded to the office of auditor-general. His political life developed rapidly thereafter: he was elected MP for the University of Dublin in the Irish parliaments of 1634 and 1637, and became a member of the privy council in Ireland in 1639; he also joined the staff of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, the lord deputy. In 1633 he made a major contribution to Irish scholarship by publishing three important Elizabethan accounts of Ireland, by Edmund Campion, Meredith Hanmer, and Edmund Spenser. (This was the first printing of Spenser's <span class="italic">View of the Present State of Ireland</span>.) Ware entitled this collection <span class="italic">The History of Ireland</span> and dedicated it to Wentworth. Also dedicated to Wentworth was his <span class="italic">De scriptoribus Hiberniae</span>, published in Dublin, 1639, a biographical register of Irish writers which contains an impressive number of names and titles that give an impression of great scholarly achievement in the early Christian centuries. Unfortunately, in most cases only the names and titles have survived, and the texts have disappeared. The register is heavily dependent on the compilations of John Bale, the mid-sixteenth-century bishop of Ossory.<br>
<br>In 1643 Ware assisted the marquess of Ormond in the treaty with the Irish rebels after their defeat, and in 1644 he was sent by Ormond, along with Lord Edward Brabazon and Sir Henry Tichborne, to inform King Charles about the situation in Ireland. Charles was then based in Oxford, and Ware spent much time in the libraries there; he was created DCL during his visit. On the voyage back his ship was captured by a parliamentarian vessel, but Ware was able to throw overboard a packet of letters to Ormond from the king. For eleven months he was a prisoner in the Tower: on his release he returned to Dublin, only to be expelled from that city in 1649 by Colonel Michael Jones, the parliamentarian governor. Ware then went to France, where he spent time at Caen and Paris. At this time he formed a friendship with the French pastor and controversialist Samuel Bochart, who was based in Caen. Bochart had a lively antiquarian curiosity, and was the author of <span class="italic">Geographia sacra</span> (1646), which offered imaginative views of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> history and described the settlements of the Phoenicians around the shore of Europe. Ware moved to London in 1651; his friends during this period in England included John Selden, Sir Roger Twysden, William Dugdale, Elias Ashmole, Sir John Marsham, and Edward Bysshe. In 1654 he published in London his major work <span class="italic">De Hibernia et antiquitatibus eius disquisitiones</span> (2nd edn, 1658), the most comprehensive account of Ireland, from its legendary origins to the conquest by the Normans, that had yet appeared.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">De Hibernia</span> remains a work of impressive scholarship in which Ware proves himself a worthy successor to his early patron James Ussher in the matter of Irish antiquities. The sections on the origins of the Irish people exhibit the characteristic preoccupations of his time with etymology and honourable lines of national descent: he derives the Scoti, who occupied Ireland in Roman times, from Scythii, and imputes a Scythian origin to the Irish, as had been the conventional opinion in the sixteenth century. He shows an unusual interest in the field monuments of ancient Ireland, with intelligent discussion of their significance. He painstakingly puts together all references to Ireland in the classical writers, to produce a valuable anthropological picture. As he moves into the early Christian period his sources multiply, so that he is able to construct a serious and credible account of the development of Irish society, with its particular manners and customs, up to the coming of the Normans. He explains at length the origins of the leading Irish families, and the meaning of Irish names, reports the superstitions of the country and the natural phenomena, and gives a knowledgeable description of Irish costume and the Irish ways of fighting. Particularly valuable are Ware's accounts of the forms of government, the codes of law, and the systems of land tenure that prevailed up to the Norman invasion. With its copious detail and trustworthy description of the antiquities and traditions of Ireland, <span class="italic">De Hibernia</span> finally brought the country out of the shadow of Britain and characterized it fully to a scholarly European audience.<br>
<br>Ware returned to Ireland at the Restoration in 1660, and resumed his position as auditor-general. He was made one of the commissioners for lands but managed to devote much time to antiquarian researches, publishing <span class="italic">Venerabilies Bedae epistolae duae</span> (1664), <span class="italic">Rerum Hibernicarum annales, 1485&#150;1558</span> (1665), and <span class="italic">De praesulibus Hiberniae commentarius</span> (1665). He died at his family house in Castle Street, Dublin, on 1 December 1666, and was buried in St Werburgh's Church. His manuscripts, of which catalogues were published in Dublin in 1688 and in London in 1690, were purchased by Henry Hyde, second earl of Clarendon, in 1686 when he was lord lieutenant of Ireland. They subsequently passed to the British Library (Clarendon Collection) and the Bodleian Library (Rawlinson Collection).<br>
