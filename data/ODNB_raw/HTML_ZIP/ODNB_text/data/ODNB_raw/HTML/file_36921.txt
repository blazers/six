<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  George</span>  (1821&#150;1905), <span class="occ">a founder of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)</span>, was born on 11 October 1821 at Ashway Farm, Dulverton, Somerset, the youngest of the seven sons of Amos Williams (1778&#150;1841), tenant farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth. Long settled on the Devon&#150;Somerset borders, his rural middle-class parents denied any Welsh connections. George was educated at Miss Timlett's dame-school in Dulverton, then at a private grammar school, Gloyns's, in Tiverton, which he left at thirteen to work on the isolated family farm. He left home two years later, in 1836, and became apprenticed to a draper, Henry William Holmes, 25 miles away in Bridgwater. The following year he was converted to evangelical Christianity, confirmed by joining the town's Zion Congregational Chapel where Holmes worshipped, and in 1839 he became a teetotaller. &#145;Drapery, Evangelicalism and temperance were thereafter chief determinants in his life&#146;, wrote his modern biographer  (Binfield, <span class="italic">Williams in Context</span>, 11).<br>
<br>Amos Williams died in 1841 and Holmes gave up running his business, so George briefly assisted a draper brother in North Petherton and then moved to London to work as a buyer for Hitchcock, Rogers &amp; Co., a large retail drapers at 72 St Paul's Churchyard. In 1842 he was received into the old King's Weigh House Chapel in the City of London, &#145;the Nonconformist Cathedral of Wealth, and of the middle-classes&#146;  (Binfield, <span class="italic">George Williams and the YMCA</span>, 26), where the preacher was the self-made Thomas Binney (1798&#150;1874). The young draper was also influenced by the puritanical American evangelist Charles Grandison Finney (1792&#150;1875), who visited Britain in 1849&#150;50 and again in 1858&#150;60.<br>
<br>George worked strenuously as a young man for the Weigh House Chapel's domestic mission and Sunday school, Surrey Chapel's ragged school, and for Craven Chapel's open-air preaching and West End tract distribution. He anguished at this time in his diary, &#145;my relations all that I know of going to Hell with the exception of an uncle what little effort have I made to save them&#146;  (Binfield, <span class="italic">Williams in Context</span>, 29&#150;30). The living-in staff at Hitchcocks in the early 1840s were mostly Christian young men of intense religious spirit: a house chaplain had been engaged, and there were prayer meetings, a young men's missionary society, and a mutual improvement society.<br>
<br>Then, on 6 June 1844, a dozen or so young shop assistants, mostly employees of Hitchcocks like George Williams, convened a prayer-group meeting in a room above the premises, and here they set up the YMCA to be<blockquote>a society which should have for its object the arousing of converted men in the different drapery Establishments in the Metropolis to a sense of their obligation and responsibility as Christians in diffusing religious knowledge to those around them either through the medium of prayer meetings or any other meetings they think proper. (Binfield, <span class="italic">George Williams and the YMCA</span>, 120)</blockquote>Soon the message was spread by a paid secretary, utilizing the new railways, and the London YMCA rapidly grew into an international movement within protestant Europe, America, and the white dominions, &#145;the great central labour exchange of the whole empire&#146;  (Begbie, 53), of which Williams is generally accepted as the founder. He had also become indispensable, meanwhile, to the expanding St Paul's Churchyard business and on 9 June 1853 married Helen (1832&#150;1919), eldest surviving daughter of George Hitchcock (1795&#150;1863), the firm's enterprising head, and was taken into partnership. The married couple lived at 30 Woburn Square, London, for nearly twenty years, then also in Bloomsbury at 13 Russell Square. They had five surviving sons and one daughter, Nellie, whose sudden death at nineteen came as a severe blow.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Williams left evangelical dissent for evangelical Anglicanism, first at Trinity Church, Little Queen Street, and then at Portman Chapel, Baker Street, where his father-in-law and the seventh earl of Shaftesbury (1801&#150;1885) also worshipped. The subsequent growth of the YMCA as an arm of episcopalianism, as well as of nonconformity, owed much to his Portman Chapel years. In September 1863, on Hitchcock's death, he became sole proprietor of the drapery firm, shifted it to wholesaling, and took over as treasurer of the London YMCA. He was joined in business over the next decade by a nephew, John Williams (1844&#150;1931), and by his two eldest sons, Frederick (1855&#150;1938) and Howard (1856&#150;1929), who became partners in 1883, and then by his youngest surviving son, Alfred Thomas (1866&#150;1908). In 1892 the firm changed its name to Hitchcock, Williams &amp; Co., closing down only during the 1984 recession, by which time it was probably the City's oldest clothing and wholesale company.<br>
<br>Williams played an important role in the development of the national council of YMCAs by raising capital to prevent Exeter Hall, where the YMCA often met, from becoming a music-hall. It opened instead in 1881 as headquarters for the London YMCAs and a new national council, of which he became first president in 1882. He also went to countless philanthropic conferences, attending four of the six international YMCA conferences between 1855 and 1880, influenced the emergence of the YMCA International Committee based in Geneva, and in 1876 toured North America. Shaftesbury, the YMCA's first president (1851&#150;85), wrote of Williams, &#145;he is a dear, noble, and generous man&#146;. Short and dapper, in old age he had a patriarchal white beard but his eyes still glowed with a mischievous twinkle.<br>
<br>In June 1894, the jubilee of the London YMCA, Williams received the freedom of the City of London, and the following month was knighted by Queen Victoria on the recommendation of the prime minister, Lord Rosebery. There were now about 150,000 British YMCA members, 450,000 in America, and 120,000 in Germany. In April 1905 he was in Paris for the YMCA's international jubilee, sharing the world presidency with Prince Oscar Bernadotte, the Swedish national president. Williams was said to be president and financial supporter of nearly forty well-intentioned societies, apart from the YMCA, including the London City Mission, the Christian Cyclists' Union, the Anti-Sunday Travelling Union, the Religious Tract Society, the Early Closing Association, the Anti-Tobacco Union, the Band of Hope, the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association, and the City of London Total Abstainers' Union. He died, aged eighty-four, imagining he was still addressing young men, on 6 November 1905 at the Victoria and Albert Hotel, Torquay, Devon, survived by his widow and five sons. An impressive funeral ceremony was held in St Paul's Cathedral, where he was buried in the crypt on 14 November 1905.<br>
