<span class="headword">Braithwaite,  William John</span>  (1875&#150;1938), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at the rectory, Great Waldingfield, Suffolk, on 1 June 1875, the second son of the Revd Francis Joseph Braithwaite (<i>d</i>. 1889), rector of Great Waldingfield, and his wife, Mary Hopkinson. He was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship and won first classes in classical moderations (1896) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1898). He took a very high place (sixth) in the civil-service examinations in 1898 and entered the Inland Revenue. Here he established himself as a first-rate official, preparing the work for the innovative land taxes introduced in the budget of 1909, and conducting an inquiry into local income taxes in Switzerland and Germany in 1910. He was made assistant secretary of the Board of Inland Revenue in 1910, and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1911. He married on 2 June 1908 Lilian Grace, daughter of Andrew Duncan of Chislehurst, with whom he had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>The high point of Braithwaite's career was his work on the national health insurance scheme which formed part 1 of the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> of 1911. The scheme instigated the first state-organized programme to provide for the health needs of a workforce vastly changed by nineteenth-century industrialization and urbanization. A large part of the workforce was compelled to pay regular contributions into an insurance fund. These contributions were matched by employers and the Treasury to underpin a fund which could pay out a range of health benefits on sickness, disablement, medical treatment, maternity care, and sanatorium attendance. As a former resident (1898&#150;1903) at Toynbee Hall, the university settlement in the East End of London, Braithwaite had, like his friend and near contemporary, William Beveridge, a familiarity with social problems. He was picked by Lloyd George, then chancellor of the exchequer, to go to Germany to carry out the initial investigation of how social insurance schemes operated there. In November 1910 he became Lloyd George's principal assistant in devising the detail of a scheme for Britain. His skills assisted Lloyd George in developing practicable working arrangements in which approved insurance societies were retained as the main local administrative agents. He also bolstered the chancellor in pressing on with the reform despite a lack of clear support from elsewhere within either the government or the civil service.<br>
<br>In conducting this work Braithwaite was deeply committed to state-organized social improvement but simultaneously constrained by respect for the principles of self-help, operating through voluntary associations, and limited government. As the editor of his memoirs later put it, he was a &#145;philosophic radical&#146; who &#145;had an idealist's belief that the keenness and zeal in the cause of self-government found in the small country Friendly Society in which he was interested could be developed in the whole working-population&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambulance Wagon</span>, 14). Unfortunately for Braithwaite, he was deemed too young and inexperienced to be appointed chairman of the National Health Insurance Commission, that oversaw the implementation of the scheme. This role fell to Sir Robert Morant who, following the Fabian views of the Webbs, would have preferred a non-contributory state-funded scheme and one which was directly managed by government agencies rather than by the non-governmental insurance societies. Braithwaite was made secretary to the joint committee responsible for initial implementation in 1912, but his relations with Morant were deeply strained. Overworked and on the verge of a breakdown, he was persuaded to take a holiday, and on his return he was induced to take the post of special commissioner of income tax in 1913. He held this post until his retirement in 1937.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Braithwaite was a respected public official. He was rather slow in his speech and paternal in manner but overall amiable and well liked. He &#145;had an immense capacity for work, marked organizing ability, and possessed in a high degree the quality of carrying through to a finish any task he had begun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambulance Wagon</span>, 14). In 1937 he was appointed a CB. In practice, however, Braithwaite was sidelined from an involvement in central policy for a considerable portion of his career. He was also denied recognition for his major role in what proved one of the key landmarks in the origins of the twentieth-century British welfare state. Not until the publication in 1957 of his memoirs, based on his diaries, which provide an invaluable insight into the creation of national insurance, did he receive thorough recognition of his achievements. This has been confirmed by the work of later historians researching into the public records.<br>
<br>In his spare time Braithwaite's major commitment was to the Northeyites' Boys' and Men's Club in Limehouse. This dated back to his residence in Toynbee Hall, when he helped the club's founder, Cyril Jackson. Braithwaite later took over the club's management, a role he kept for the rest of his life. His major contribution was a 12 acre sports ground at Hainault, comprising football and cricket pitches, a swimming pool, and pavilions. He organized both the fund-raising and the construction of the facilities. These were later passed to the London Playing Fields Society. His retirement came to a tragically abrupt end when he died at the British Hospital, Port Said, Egypt, on 14 March 1938 on his way home from the Far East.<br>
