<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, twelfth or third earl of Lennox  (<em>d.</em> 1526), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26496/', "Matthew Stewart, eleventh or second earl of Lennox (d. 1513)")</script>, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1530), daughter of James, first Lord Hamilton, and granddaughter of James II of Scotland. His entry to public life coincided with his marriage on 19 January 1511 to Elizabeth Stewart, eighth daughter of John Stewart, first earl of Atholl; the couple were within prohibited degrees of consanguinity and received a grant of dispensation ten days later. As part of the marriage contract the eleventh earl settled Tarbolton, Galston, and Dreghorn in Ayrshire conjointly on the newly-weds. The couple had three sons and a daughter: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26497/', "Matthew Stewart")</script>, who succeeded as thirteenth or fourth earl; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70056/', "Robert Stewart")</script>, who was briefly earl of Lennox and then earl of March and also bishop of Caithness; John, Lord d'Aubigny; and Eleanor, mistress of James V.<br>
<br>John Stewart succeeded to the title on his father's death at Flodden on 9 September 1513 and quickly established himself as a force in the political struggles that characterized the minority of James V. On the remarriage in 1514 of the king's mother, the queen regent Margaret Tudor, to Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus, Lennox aligned with his uncle James Hamilton, first earl of Arran, in an effort to frustrate this Douglas bid for control of government. He joined the appeals made by Arran to John Stewart, duke of Albany, that he should come to Scotland to assume the governorship, and took the field against Margaret's supporters, seizing Dumbarton Castle on 12 January 1515. After Albany's arrival in May 1515 Lennox took part in military action against Margaret and Angus, culminating in the blockade of Stirling Castle, where Margaret was based, and the temporary expulsion of the queen and her husband from Scotland. Lennox's support was rewarded by Albany: in October 1515 he received the tack of the crown lands of Dundonald in Ayrshire, and also a series of respites for himself and his kinsmen and servants for their actions from January to May 1515.<br>
<br>The relationship of Lennox and Arran with Albany quickly soured, the breach fuelled by accusations that the governor&#151;who was next in line for the throne after the king and his brother&#151;had designs on the crown. In early 1516 Lennox signed a bond with Arran, the earls of Glencairn and Eglinton, and Lord Home, for the removal of the king from Albany's custody, and took up arms against the governor. Arran and Lennox seized the castle at Glasgow but were forced to submit by Albany. Lennox was warded briefly in Edinburgh Castle until he delivered Dumbarton into Albany's hands, but before the end of 1516 the two men had been reconciled and Lennox was restored to favour. In May 1517 Lennox accompanied Albany to France and returned in the autumn with news of the successful negotiation of the treaty of Rouen.<br>
<br>From 1517 Lennox was associated with the administration headed by Arran that Albany had established before his departure for France. Following Albany's return in November 1521 Lennox again aligned closely with the governor and participated in his attack on Angus, who had been readmitted to a central role in government from 1517. In 1522 Lennox was present at the seizure of Tantallon Castle from Angus, but by 1523 his support for Albany had slackened and he took no part in the French-sponsored invasion of England in that year. Nevertheless, on Albany's final departure for France in May 1524, Lennox still adhered to the pro-French party. Although he formed part of the escort which accompanied Margaret Tudor and James V from Stirling to Edinburgh, there is no indication that he had joined with Arran or was associated with his uncle in the arrangement with the queen whereby the young king was declared of age, thereby technically ending Albany's governorship, nor that he supported Arran's proposal for a treaty with England. Instead he was associated with Angus in his opposition to Margaret's and Arran's exercise of government, and joined with Archbishop Beaton, Bishop Dunbar, and the earls of Argyll and Moray in urging loyalty to Albany and France.<br>
<br>In November 1524 Lennox and Angus captured Edinburgh and besieged Margaret and Arran with the young king in the castle. The siege was maintained until February 1525, when a nominal reconciliation between the factions led to Angus's readmission to Margaret's council. From this time, while Margaret remained nominally in control of her son's affairs, Angus dominated the council, with Lennox and Argyll as his associates. A bond dated 18 June 1525 between Angus, Argyll, and Lennox for both the maintenance of James V and mutual support and advancement reinforced this association. Divisions among the nobility, based upon fears that rival factions would use control of James to entrench their power at the expense of their opponents, saw the devising of a scheme in July 1525 for the quarterly rotation of possession of the king between the principal groups. Angus's refusal to yield up James at the end of his term in November 1525 established him in control of government and, though Lennox remained a member of council, also broke the close association between the two men.<br>
<br>Lennox was further alienated by Angus's advancement of his kinsmen, and, despite being appointed by parliament on 21 June 1526 as a member of a secret council to advise the king, by August he, Argyll, Cassillis, and Glencairn had ceased to attend council and had entered into a bond headed by the principal enemies of Angus. Lennox, however, harboured ambitions of his own, and had already on 30 June 1526 entered into a secret bond with the young king, who promised to take Lennox's advice before that of all others on important matters. It is uncertain if Lennox was involved in the attempt to seize James from Angus in July 1526, when Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch attacked the king's escort near Melrose, but the association of Lennox and Buccleuch later in the year suggests complicity. On 4 September 1526 Lennox staged his own bid to secure the king, who was accompanied by Angus and Arran, at Manuel near Linlithgow. The attempt failed and Lennox, who was captured, was then killed by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart. His body was taken for burial at the Dominican convent in Glasgow, where Finnart subsequently made an endowment for the weal of his victim's soul.<br>
