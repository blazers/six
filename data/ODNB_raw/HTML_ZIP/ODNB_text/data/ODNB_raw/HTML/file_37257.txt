<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Calvert,  Cecil</span>, second Baron Baltimore  (1605&#150;1675), <span class="occ">colonial promoter</span>, was born on 8 August 1605, probably in Kent, and baptized on 2 March 1606, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4420/', "George Calvert, first Baron Baltimore (1579/80&#150;1632)")</script>, statesman, and his first wife, Anne (1579&#150;1622), the daughter of George Mynne of Hertingfordbury. George Calvert, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir Robert Cecil, after whom he named his eldest son, was a member of the privy council and principal secretary of state in the reign of James I. He resigned his office in November 1624, but was retained on the council when he announced his family's conversion to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Cecil matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 16 July 1621 but did not proceed to a degree. A year before his father's conversion Cecil journeyed to Rome and made his own avowal of Catholicism. In 1628 he married Anne, the Catholic daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/726/', "Thomas Arundell, first Baron Arundell of Wardour")</script>, and became even more firmly identified with the Catholic faction. They had at least five children, including two sons, the elder of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Cecil Calvert shared his father's interest in the New World and was actively involved in his effort to establish a colony. When the charter to Maryland sought by George Calvert passed the great seal on 20 June 1632, Cecil Calvert was named the grantee since his father had died earlier in the year and Cecil had inherited the barony. The charter granted Calvert palatinate powers over a domain of almost 7 million acres that had once belonged to Virginia. Disputes with that Chesapeake neighbour would trouble the new Lord Baltimore for the remainder of his life. He was himself forced to remain in England to defend his interests and never settled in his colony, appointing in his stead first his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4424/', "Leonard Calvert")</script> and then his second son, Charles, to the post of governor.<br>
<br>Although concerned like his father to offer relief to Catholics, Calvert was also motivated by the desire for profit that characterized most colonial promoters. The manuscript <span class="italic">Account of the Colony of the Lord Baron of Baltimore</span> (1633), written by the Revd Andrew White and edited by Calvert, was a promotional piece that enthused about the natural blessings of the region. Calvert sought to attract large investors to whom he would grant large manors in the expectation that they would then bring indentured servants with them to work the land.<br>
<br>Vulnerable to the attacks of his enemies because of his religion, Calvert said little about the role of Catholics in the colony and urged them to maintain a low profile. He worked to prevent the Jesuits from acquiring land and influence. Though he supported their spiritual ministry, he believed their efforts to be divisive in the colony and he came close to expelling them in 1642. In 1643 he invited New England settlers to move to Maryland, and in 1648 and 1649 he encouraged disgruntled Virginia puritans to settle there, hoping these moves and the appointment of a protestant governor and council would avoid action against his colony by the English parliament. Through his instructions he was partly responsible for the 1649 <span class="roman">Maryland Act of Toleration</span>, which was the earliest legislation in the English-speaking world that explicitly guaranteed toleration to all Christians. These efforts did not, however, prevent parliament from appointing commissioners to take control of the colony in 1652. Oliver Cromwell, however, restored Calvert's proprietary rights in 1658.<br>
<br>Calvert's last years as proprietor were troubled by growing political, religious, and economic divisions within Maryland. He responded with policies that restricted the franchise and gave the governor power to manipulate the composition of the lower legislative house. These in turn prompted greater resistance, and eventually a successful uprising against the proprietary in 1689.<br>
<br>Calvert died on 30 November 1675 in London, and was buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex. He was succeeded in the barony by his second son, Charles.<br>
