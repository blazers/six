<span class="headword">Fountaine,  Margaret Elizabeth</span>  (1862&#150;1940), <span class="occ">lepidopterist and diarist</span>, was born on 16 May 1862 at South Acre, near Norwich, Norfolk, the second of eight children and eldest daughter of John Fountaine, rector of South Acre, and his wife, Mary Isabella (Isobel) Lee-Warner (<i>d</i>. 1906). After his death in 1877, Isobel, with her six daughters and two sons, moved to Eaton Grange in Norwich. On 15 April 1878 Margaret, who was educated at home, began keeping a diary, which she continued from April to April of each year until a few months before her death. Although proud of ancestors who had come over with the Conqueror, she also brought to a strict Victorian family an unconventional spirit that often put her at odds with her relatives. As she observed in her diary on 15 April 1883, &#145;My ruling passion is the love of independence&#146;  (Fountaine, <span class="italic">Love among the Butterflies</span>, 28). Her unconventionality was manifested at the age of twenty-eight by her infatuation with an Irishman, Septimus Hewson, one of the paid choristers of Norwich Cathedral, though she deemed him her inferior. She followed him to Dublin, having imagined an engagement where none existed, and he remained the greatest disillusionment of her life.<br>
<br>After Fountaine came out socially, she dabbled in art, for which she had shown some talent, and studied singing in a desultory way. But after her uncle Edward Fountaine left her a bequest in 1891 that allowed her to travel far beyond Dublin, she found her true vocation in collecting butterflies, to which she devoted the rest of her life. She pursued this vocation worldwide, first in Europe and after 1901 often in the Middle and Near East. She refused to ride side-saddle, and accompanied only by a guide or translator ventured intrepidly into remote areas where she felt protected by her own sense of rectitude&#151;for, in her own words, &#145;There is a direct and special protection over a pure and high-minded woman, which no man however base can break through&#146;  (Fountaine, <span class="italic">Love among the Butterflies</span>, 68)&#151;and perhaps by her size: she was unusually tall, standing 5 feet 9 inches.<br>
<br>Fountaine claimed to find would-be admirers almost everywhere and turned down many proposals of marriage. One suitor, the British vice-consul at Broussa, threatened her with a breach-of-promise suit after she broke the engagement she had agreed to in 1905. Despite her pride in class, which was apparently always malleable, she had formed a liaison with her Syrian dragoman, Khalil Neimy (1877&#150;1929), which from about 1903 became a marriage in all but name. Enduring for twenty-seven years, their relationship survived her shock at learning, in 1901 after she agreed to marry him (twenty-four to her thirty-nine), that he was already married. Their various later plans to marry also fell through. Accompanied by Neimy, she travelled in 1908&#150;9 to South Africa and elsewhere in Africa; in 1910 she visited a brother in the United States; in 1911 she travelled in Costa Rica; in 1912 in India, Ceylon, and Tibet.<br>
<br>From 1914 to 1917 Fountaine and Neimy made a disastrous attempt to settle in Australia as farmers, after which she went alone to the United States, until in 1919 she left for Fiji. In 1920 she rejoined Neimy in New Zealand briefly, before returning alone to the United States and then to England. In 1923 they travelled together to Burma, but since he insisted on returning to Damascus to care for his ailing mother (over Fountaine's jealous objections), she returned to England, where in 1925 she established a large studio at 100A Fellowes Road, Hampstead. For the rest of her life this was her home whenever she returned to England. Then she set off on her travels again, principally in Africa, until a commission to secure particular specimens sent her to the West Indies. After Neimy died in 1929, she went to South America, determined to bury her grief in work, and she continued her worldwide travelling, with intervals in England, until her death at Mount St Benedict, after suffering a stroke on 21 April 1940 while collecting on the island of Trinidad.<br>
<br>The fruit of her travels was the Fountaine&#150;Neimy collection of about 22,000 butterflies, bequeathed to the Castle Museum in Norwich, together with twelve volumes of her diaries (1878&#150;1939), over 1 million words long and without margins. In addition, her carefully drawn sketchbooks of larvae and pupae, many previously undescribed, repose in the Natural History Museum, South Kensington. Although she began her diary as a serial record, she later kept notes drafted into a continuous narrative instead, usually during the following year. A year's record, copied into identically bound ledger-like leather books each about the size and thickness of a London telephone directory, also notes the time required to read it, and includes a studio portrait of Fountaine herself, typically standing straight with shoulders back, barely smiling or unsmiling, eyes focused fearlessly ahead. Variations in ink colour show that before Fountaine began recording a new year, she established the reading time for a previous year's account by rereading it. The diaries' readability is considerably enhanced by the two-stage compositional methods she developed. She was a talented writer and could build up a scene or a characterization through the accretion of details or a telling phrase or mood. She never, however, violated the serial nature of a diary, refusing both the novelist's foreshadowing and the autobiographer's retrospective reflection, and remaining faithful to the ongoing record of her adventurous life.<br>
