<span class="headword">Macdonald sisters</span>  (<em>act. </em>1837&#150;1925)<span class="occ"></span>, four daughters of a Methodist minister, George Browne Macdonald (1805&#150;1868), and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1809&#150;1875), went on to have notable lives through either marriage or parenthood. George Macdonald was an easy-going and energetic man and a kind father, although often absent. Hannah was the stricter parent, at times overwhelmed and depressed by the task of raising her large family on a minister's income. Her children remembered her as an excellent nurse and a family prohibition against idleness was relaxed only when one of the children was ill, which may have contributed to a family tendency to hypochondria. Both parents were well educated&#151;the children were allowed great freedom to use their father's library and were well taught by their mother. The family was musical and the children made a great deal of their own entertainment. Owing to the Methodist church's custom of relocating its ministers every three years the household was what the Macdonalds referred to as a &#145;moving tent&#146;. This constant moving undoubtedly contributed to Hannah Macdonald's melancholy but also ensured an unusual degree of closeness among her two sons and six daughters (three children died in infancy and one daughter, Carrie, in her teens). Despite the drawbacks of this peripatetic life, the Macdonalds, especially the sisters, grew up to be spirited, witty, and a little wild.<br>
<br>The eldest surviving daughter, <a name="cosubject_58273"></a><span class="headword">Alice Kipling <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Macdonald]</span></span>  (1837&#150;1910)<span class="occ"></span>, mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34334/', "(Joseph) Rudyard Kipling")</script>, was born in Sheffield on 4 April 1837. The story that she once baked a mouse in pastry and dared a friend to eat it may be a family myth but she was certainly bold enough to try it and tough enough to find it amusing. By her teens she was engaged to an Oxford friend of her brother's who was studying for the ministry.<br>
<br>In 1853 the family moved to London. They found London life exceedingly stimulating and the girls spent a lot of time with the Pre-Raphaelite artists, among them Edward Burne-Jones, whom they knew from childhood. Alice was writing poetry and attributed her failure to get into print to gender discrimination. She was not ready to settle down as a clergyman's wife and her engagement quietly died. She later made quite a hobby of getting engaged, most notably to the poet William Allingham, and her father had to speak to her about her flirting. In 1863 she met John Lockwood Kipling (1837&#150;1911), an artist working for the Department of Science and Arts in South Kensington. They married in 1865 and immediately embarked for India, where Kipling had gained a post in an art school in Bombay. His calm good nature complemented her quick, sharp wit&#151;her brother observed how her words tumbled over each other in her haste to get them out. It is fortunate that she was happy in her marriage because she hated India. She turned her social talents to gaining professional advancement for her husband and to social advantage for them both.<br>
<br>The birth of Alice's first child, Rudyard, late in 1865 was so difficult that the Kiplings decided any future children must be born in England. In 1868 she took Rudyard to England, where he stayed with her parents while she gave birth to her daughter Alice, known in the family as Trix. Something went wrong on this trip: perhaps Rudyard, the spoiled darling of an Indian ayah, was too much for the Macdonalds (George Macdonald was ill and died shortly after their visit), perhaps the sisters, now well married to husbands more prosperous than hers, annoyed Alice; whatever it was, the visit was a disappointment and may have led her to make the greatest mistake of her life. When her third child, John, died weeks after his birth in 1870, the Kiplings decided that the time had come for Rudyard and Trix to return to England. Possibly because Alice was at odds with her family, the children were sent not to their family but to strangers in Southsea, where they boarded for over ten years. The experience may not have been as traumatic as Rudyard later depicted it, but he suffered a breakdown as a result of it and Trix suffered mental illness for a large part of her life. The family coolness existed largely in Alice's mind and the family kept an eye on the two children; Georgiana and Edward Burne-Jones rescued Rudyard when he was in danger of going blind and alerted his mother to his condition.<br>
<br>While the children were suffering in England, their parents were unhappy in India, missing their children but believing in the rightness of their actions. Alice's attempts to advance her husband's career bore fruit in 1875 when he was made principal of a new art school in Lahore. Both wrote in their free time and their social life prospered. They were introduced to the viceroy when John designed and Alice helped to make a series of banners for the Delhi durbar and thereafter they moved in the highest circles of Anglo-Indian society. This effort was not mere social climbing but was rather the means to financial security for themselves and their family. It financed a long trip home, as Alice realized that all was not well with her children. It set in place a network of connections that Alice could use to promote her son's career upon his return.<br>
<br>By 1883 both children were back in India. The Kiplings rejoiced in being again what they called the family square. Indeed, their efforts at family unity seem a little fevered, as if to make up for all the years of separation. Nevertheless, they claimed to be ecstatically happy together. All four of them wrote and Alice proved Rudyard's fiercest critic. Alice's connections obtained Rudyard his first newspaper job. When Trix shocked Anglo-Indian society by attracting his son, the viceroy appealed to Alice Kipling to send her daughter away in order to prevent a misalliance. The viceroy blinked first and his son returned to England. The Kiplings were not universally liked in their last years in India, but they were respected, and Alice had her share in that.<br>
<br>The Kiplings left India for good in 1893 and settled in Tisbury, in Wiltshire. The divisions between Alice and her sisters were largely healed and she spent a great deal of time with them. Neither of her children's marriages brought her the kind of satisfaction she might have hoped for&#151;Rudyard's wife was as formidable a personality as Alice herself, and equally determined to control his affairs, while Trix's marriage was always shaky and Alice believed that it was responsible for Trix's mental breakdowns. In her later years Alice looked after Trix herself and sometimes seemed as disturbed as her daughter. Only Rudyard Kipling's success gave cause for satisfaction. Alice died at Tisbury on 23 November 1910; John outlived her by only two months.<br>
<br>Alice Kipling like many women of her time lived in the career of her husband and son. She probably had the greater impact on the former, although it is for the latter that she is remembered.<br>
<br>The fifth Macdonald child and second surviving daughter, <a name="cosubject_58271"></a><span class="headword">Georgiana  Burne-Jones</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Georgiana Macdonald]</span>, Lady Burne-Jones  (1840&#150;1920)<span class="occ"></span>, wife and biographer of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4051/', "Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones, first baronet")</script>, was born in Birmingham on 21 July 1840. Like her elder sister, she was educated largely at home. When she was eleven the family first met Edward Burne-Jones, a schoolfriend of their elder brother. When the family moved to London, Georgie enrolled at the Government School of Design in Kensington. Although she appears to have had some talent, she saw her training as an adjunct to her main role as helper to Burne-Jones, to whom she was officially engaged at the age of fifteen. Their parents allowed the sisters a great deal of freedom to associate with Burne-Jones and his friends, all of whom repaid this trust with impeccable behaviour. Georgie was the quiet, steadfast sister, tiny in stature, with large, striking eyes whose gaze often seemed to be judging weaker mortals. Her patience was to be a singular asset to her married life.<br>
<br>They were married in 1860. Burne-Jones fell ill, as was his habit in any stressful situation, and Georgie spent her honeymoon nursing him. A family biographer records an otherwise composed Georgie breaking a necklace in their hotel room and scrabbling on the floor to collect the lost beads  (Baldwin, 135). She found that Burne-Jones was less inclined to encourage artistic endeavour in a wife than in a fianc&eacute;e and this together with her awe at the abilities of her husband and his friends prevented her from developing her own talent. The birth of her first child, Philip, in 1861 separated her further from the artists' world, and her husband's inability to handle money led her to take command of the family's financial affairs. Yet the early years of marriage were happy. She always felt that happiness was a debit in an account that must be paid off by suffering in the future, and so it seemed to be when she fell seriously ill with scarlet fever in 1864, giving birth to her second son prematurely. She recovered but the baby died. Edward, predictably, was prostrated and in the way they dealt separately with their sorrow, something in the marriage was lost. It was said that Georgie always looked a little pale and faded afterwards, and she wrote years later that she felt the presence of the &#145;little shadowy babe&#146; she had lost for the rest of her life  (Flanders, 273). After the birth of their daughter in 1866 Edward embarked on a very public affair during the final years of the decade with the sculptor Marie Zambaco. They repaired their marriage but it was never quite the same.<br>
<br>At this point Georgie embarked on a life less dependent on her husband. She had a series of influential friendships&#151;with William Morris (with whom she shared an interest in socialism and the experience of a disloyal spouse), with Rosalind Howard, who tried to interest her in women's suffrage, and with George Eliot, who encouraged her to educate herself. Georgie did educate herself, adopted Morris's politics, and bought a house. The house at Rottingdean, near Brighton, was always more hers than Edward's and she spent more time there as the years passed. When the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1894 empowered villages to elect parish councils, she ran as an independent and became the only woman member of the Rottingdean council, serving until 1901.<br>
<br>Edward Burne-Jones died suddenly in 1898. He had asked Georgie to write his biography and she took great pride in doing so, producing a book that is still respected today, although she avoided excessive frankness about some of the personal details. She was close to her nephew Rudyard Kipling and his family, who had settled nearby. She opposed the South African War and was once rescued from an angry crowd by the pro-war Kipling when she hung out a banner proclaiming her beliefs. The villagers considered her eccentric but admired her fearlessness, while she gained an iconic status within the family. She left the parish council in 1901 and died at 55 Holland Road, Kensington, London on 2 February 1920.<br>
<br>Georgiana Burne-Jones was perhaps the most complex of the Macdonald sisters. Although starting married life as they did, determined to live her life through her family, the deficiencies of her husband and the opportunities offered within their social circle enabled and encouraged her to find interests of her own. She was the strong one of the family, who sorted out everyone else's crises, but she made a good job of her own life too, a life that all too easily disappeared in the shadow of her family.<br>
<br>The Macdonalds' third surviving daughter, <a name="cosubject_58272"></a><span class="headword">Agnes Poynter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Macdonald]</span></span>, Lady Poynter  (1843&#150;1906)<span class="occ"></span>, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35600/', "Sir Edward John Poynter, first baronet")</script>, was born in Leeds on 25 September 1843. She was an excellent pianist and had a more placid and sunny nature than her sisters; the latter shared a fondness for what the family called &#145;the joy of grief&#146;  (Taylor, 21). She was thought the best-looking of the sisters&#151;John Lockwood called her &#145;tyrannously pretty&#146;&#151;and attracted suitors from her early teens  (ibid., 52). Although she enjoyed the company of the Pre-Raphaelite artists whom she met at Burne-Jones's studio, she gravitated to more mainstream fashionable society, preferring the modish crinoline to the plain aesthetic dress favoured by Georgie. This preference for the fashionable may explain why she married the dour and temperamental Edward Poynter.<br>
<br>Satirized in George Du Maurier's novel <span class="italic">Trilby</span> as Lorrimer, &#145;the industrious apprentice&#146;, Poynter achieved enormous financial and social success as an academic painter, specializing in epic canvases with classical themes, and as an administrator, becoming president of the Royal Academy. Poynter and Agnes were married in 1866 and embarked on a glittering social career that took its toll on their marriage and their health. Their son Ambrose was born in 1867 and Agnes was often unwell, suffering from headaches, possibly neuralgia or, as unkind observers guessed, from a difficult marriage. Edward Poynter worked for seven days a week and collapsed when a painting was finished; his working pattern suggests manic depression. He obviously loved Agnes, grieving almost excessively when she died, but he was quite unable to show emotion, and she was probably unique in feeling any sympathy for him.<br>
<br>This bleak outlook, beneath the fa&ccedil;ade of social and professional success, was lightened somewhat when Agnes became pregnant unexpectedly in her late thirties. Her embarrassment about what was then considered very late motherhood was increased when she went into labour at a dinner party and was obliged to give birth in her hosts' house. The birth of her second son, Hugh, caused great mirth in her family and seems to have lightened the gloom that had settled over her household. Poynter does not appear to have been a cruel man&#151;his nephews Stanley Baldwin and Rudyard Kipling got on well with him&#151;but everyone agreed that any lightness and charm within that household emanated from Agnes.<br>
<br>In later life the Poynters travelled in Europe but Agnes's health declined rapidly after 1900. In 1903 she underwent an operation, probably for cancer. She kept going, possibly to reassure her husband, even travelling to Turkey in 1905 to attend Hugh's wedding. She died in London on 12 June 1906.<br>
<br>Agnes Poynter enjoyed the greatest marital and worldly success of all the sisters, judged by the standards of their time, but her life was in its way the least satisfactory. Her family blamed her husband for the sad life of this most loved sister, but he may not have been entirely at fault. Agnes illustrates how a certain lack of resourcefulness might overtake a pretty and vivacious woman when the dissatisfactions of mature life began to overtake the promise of youth and other consolations had to be found to take their place. At the same time, she was plainly indispensable to her husband, supplying the social grace and charm that he so conspicuously lacked.<br>
<br>The fourth surviving daughter, <a name="cosubject_58274"></a><span class="headword">Louisa Baldwin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Macdonald]</span></span>  (1845&#150;1925)<span class="occ"></span>, mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30550/', "Stanley Baldwin")</script>, was born in Wakefield on 25 August 1845. She was quiet and somewhat lacking in self-confidence, perhaps overshadowed by the stronger personalities of her older sisters. In her teens she modelled for Burne-Jones and his friends, became proficient at making woodcuts, wrote fiction, and studied at the Wolverhampton School of Art. She had the reputation of being somewhat aloof, possibly because of her poor vision, which made it difficult for her to recognize people she did not know well. By the time she came of age the family was deeply involved in the art world, through the marriages of the two older sisters, but Louisa accepted the proposal of the earnest Worcestershire ironmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40801/', "Alfred Baldwin")</script> and married him in a double wedding with her sister Agnes in 1866. He converted her to high-church Anglicanism without difficulty, but she seems to have had some trouble adjusting to life in rural Worcestershire, where they settled to be near the business. She may have been lonely with a husband often preoccupied with the demands of a successful business and two sisters living in London. This may have contributed to the illness that overtook her after the birth of Stanley Baldwin in 1867. She appears to have had one and perhaps two miscarriages after his birth, and she may simply have settled on ill health as a way of ensuring that she had no more pregnancies. The causes and nature of her illness are mysterious, but it was extremely debilitating; she spent most of her time lying down, often in a darkened room, and if she went out at all it was in a bath chair. She tried a dazzling variety of cures and treatments, the most startling of all being the champagne cure, which caused her to fall down. Her three-year-old son emulated her by putting cushions on a chair and announcing &#145;Stanley poorly back&#146;  (Flanders, 128). The 1870s were spent travelling in pursuit of health&#151;biographers have based their diagnosis of hypochondria on Louisa's sudden return to energy and mobility when abroad or visiting her sisters  (ibid., 149).<br>
<br>Despite her poor health, Louisa's life does not seem to have been unhappy. Released from the duties of housekeeping, she read widely, studied languages, and wrote novels, poetry, and collections of stories. Her nephew Rudyard Kipling was a gentle critic. She was not a very good writer, but writing passed the time and gave her the creative outlet she craved. Nor did illness ruin her marriage&#151;Louisa and Alfred shared a strong religious faith that enabled them to view her illness as a trial sent to strengthen them. It was, however, what her brother-in-law John Kipling called a &#145;caded&#146; life, sheltered to the extent that Louisa could not grow, either as a person or as a writer  (Taylor, 102).<br>
<br>In 1883 Louisa suddenly began to get well. The reason for her recovery is as mysterious as the cause of her illness. She took over a number of good works in Wilden, the Worcestershire village where they lived, including teaching in the Sunday school and running groups for the wives of her husband's workers. In 1892 Alfred was elected to parliament and they spent more time in London. Her recovery did not last long, and she gradually returned to a state of permanent invalidity, especially after Alfred's death in 1908. She lived to see her son become prime minister and commissioned Morris &amp; Co. to design stained-glass windows for Wilden church as memorials to her family, after drawings by Burne-Jones. She died at Wilden on 16 May 1925 and was buried in Wilden churchyard.<br>
<br>Louisa Macdonald Baldwin is in many ways the hardest of the sisters to capture. If more were known about her health, it might be proved either that she was a hypochondriac or that she genuinely suffered from a painful undiagnosed illness. Whether through her own lack of will or through circumstances outside her control, Louisa remains a frustrating case of a life that never quite took shape.<br>
<br>The Macdonald sisters illustrated almost the whole range of roles open to women of their class in Victorian England. Alice exemplified the ambitious wife and mother; Georgie began as the self-sacrificing wife and ended as a parish councillor, a political force in her own right; Agnes was the model wife for a successful man, offering the social polish he lacked; and the life of Louisa, also a loyal wife, reflected the frustrations and limitations inherent in such a life. As a group they were strong-willed and somewhat intolerant&#151;their standards were high, and they made no effort to adapt to those who could not meet them. On the other hand they were intelligent and artistic, bringing out the talents of their spouses and descendants. Georgie's great-grandson Colin MacInnes said of them that they were &#145;the sort of family that one would perhaps rather read about than belong to&#146;  (Flanders, 329).<br>
