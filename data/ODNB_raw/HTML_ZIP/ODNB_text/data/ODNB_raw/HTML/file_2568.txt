<span class="headword">Blair,  Patrick</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1728), <span class="occ">botanist and surgeon</span>, was born at Lethendy, Perthshire, the third son of George Blair (<i>d</i>. 1682), a farmer, and his wife, Euphame. Little is known of his early life, and his date of birth is not certain. He was apprenticed to a surgeon-apothecary from the late 1680s, possibly in Coupar Angus, Perthshire, where he was later in practice. Between 1694 and 1697 he was in the Low Countries, mainly Flanders, where he practised surgery and also made botanical observations. His knowledge of continental botanical theories may date from this period. Blair was in Dundee by 1700, and in 1701 advertised a projected anatomical handbook in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Gazette</span> (where he is identified as &#145;surgeon-apothecary of Dundee&#146;). This work was never published, although Blair described it in a letter to James Petiver in 1709.<br>
<br>Blair married Elizabeth or Elspeth Whyte in April 1702. Their son John was baptized in 1703. They had another son, Henry, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Isobell (<i>d</i>. 1745).<br>
<br>In April 1706 a female Indian elephant, which had been exhibited around northern Scotland, died near Dundee. Blair was given the opportunity to anatomize it, and with the help of local butchers he skinned the elephant and retrieved the bones, which he mounted for exhibition in Dundee, along with the stuffed skin. He wrote a detailed paper on the elephant's anatomy, which was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society of London in 1710, and also published as a pamphlet in 1713, under the title of <span class="italic">Osteographia elephantina</span>. In 1712 Blair was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in the same year was granted an MD from King's College, Aberdeen, on the rolls of which he is identified as residing in Coupar Angus. Blair also enrolled an apprentice in Coupar Angus in that year, so presumably he had by then moved there from Dundee. He contributed several more papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, mainly on botanical subjects. Blair corresponded with Hans Sloane and James Petiver on these topics. He had been introduced to Sloane by Charles Preston in 1705.<br>
<br>In 1713 Blair journeyed to London, staying with Petiver, and visited Jacob Bobart in Oxford on the way back; Bobart, like Blair, upheld Robert Morison's system of classification of plants over that of John Ray. He also travelled to Lichfield to meet Sir John Floyer, with whom he agreed on the value of cold bathing, especially in nervous disorders.<br>
<br>Blair came from a family of Jacobites and was acquainted with the Jacobite physician Archibald Pitcairne, as well as with the earl of Mar. In 1715 Blair joined Lord Nairn's battalion as a surgeon and was taken prisoner at Preston. He was taken to London and imprisoned at Newgate, where he was tried on 31 March 1716, pleaded guilty, and was condemned to death. Sloane and Petiver visited him in prison, and Blair appealed to Sloane and Richard Mead to secure him a pardon. Blair assured Sloane that he had joined the rebel army involuntarily. On the night before his scheduled execution, Blair awaited impatiently the arrival of his expected pardon, which arrived only after midnight.<br>
<br>Blair apparently had some difficulty in re-establishing his practice after his imprisonment. In 1719 he wrote to Sloane asking for a loan to enable him to set up a practice in Newcastle. However, he continued to publish scientific works, including an account of pyloric stenosis in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1717, probably the earliest account of that condition. He published his <span class="italic">Miscellaneous observations in the practise of physick, anatomy and surgery: with new and curious remarks in botany</span> in London in 1718.<br>
<br>Blair finally settled about 1720 in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he practised medicine and continued his botanical studies. His <span class="italic">Botanick Essays</span> appeared in the same year. Blair's interest in botany was both medical and scientific; he was interested in pharmaceutical uses of plants but also investigated their intrinsic properties. In <span class="italic">Botanick Essays</span> he discussed the new concept of plant sexuality. However, like many of his British contemporaries, Blair viewed plant reproduction as hermaphroditic, rather than requiring two different sexes. He was an &#145;ovulist&#146; rather than a &#145;pollenist&#146;, and engaged in controversy over this matter with other botanists, particularly Richard Bradley.<br>
<br>In 1723 Blair published the first volume of his <span class="italic">Pharmaco-botanologia</span>, an encyclopaedic account of the plants listed in the London pharmacopoeia. The last volume of this work, which took it up to the letter H, appeared in 1728. Blair died at Boston in January 1728.<br>
