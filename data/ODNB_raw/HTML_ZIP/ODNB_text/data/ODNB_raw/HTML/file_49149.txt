<span class="headword">Kennedy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Walker]</span>,  Margaret Stephen</span>  (1814&#150;1891), <span class="occ">missionary in India</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 18 January 1814, the youngest of at least four daughters of John Walker (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;<i>c</i>.1860), a prosperous businessman whose enterprises failed in the 1830s, making it necessary for Margaret to support herself as a teacher. Fortunately she had been sent to one of the best girls' schools in Aberdeen, and had become a voracious reader and competent bookkeeper. An elder of his church, Walker dominated his family and was the principal influence on his daughter, together with Mr Aitken, minister of the Old Secession Church of Anti-Burghers, Aberdeen (later united with the Free Church of Scotland). However, she rejected the former's strict sabbatarianism and dour dutiful approach to religion. This was because she experienced, according to an autobiographical fragment left to her children, and quoted extensively in her husband's memoir of her (1892), a direct revelation, &#145;as if the sun had burst out in the darkness of midnight&#146;  (Kennedy, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 8). Faith was sheer joy and peace, despite great anguish and suffering in India, and the deaths before the age of five of three among her seven children. She loved singing hymns, and made Sunday observance enjoyable for her family. She rejected the strict Calvinist opposition to missions.<br>
<br>Margaret Walker went to India and joined her sister Eliza Ann (<i>d</i>. 1857) and her brother-in-law, the controversial Scottish London Missionary Society (LMS) missionary William Buyers (1804&#150;1865), until 1840, when ill health forced them to leave their work in Benares, but then she married a Scottish LMS colleague, the Revd James Kennedy (1815&#150;1899) from near Aberdeen and she stayed on as an LMS missionary. While always upholding the Westminster confession (1648) and strict evangelical principles, Margaret Kennedy became increasingly ecumenically minded in India. She also initiated work among women. Ill health forced her to go to the Kumaon hills in 1848, where from 1869 to 1877 she and her husband were involved in pioneering work developing the hill station of Ranikhet, building a church and schools and comforting lepers. She had to return to Scotland in the years 1850&#150;53, 1857&#150;9 (after harrowing experiences in the Indian mutiny in which her sister and many friends died), 1862&#150;5, and 1874, when she devoted herself to her children and parish work. Always opposed to women speaking in public, she did no deputation work even though her husband wished her to preach, but conducted women's meetings in Benares and Ranikhet, ran superb Sunday schools, and did much pastoral work as she spoke fluent Hindustani and Hindi. She superintended the LMS orphanage in Benares and organized girls' schools whenever possible, but prejudice against female education made this difficult. Although not medically trained, her ministrations to the constant stream of Indian sufferers were much appreciated. Her effectiveness as an evangelist was indirect, through her friendships with members of different races and classes, even a Coorgi princess. The quality of her life distinguished her&#151;her cheerfulness, patience, and attempts to walk closely with God&#151;rather than the creation of enduring institutions.<br>
<br>In 1877 the Kennedys returned to Scotland. James Kennedy was a Congregationalist minister at Portobello, near Edinburgh, from 1878 to 1882, then retired to Acton, Middlesex. Margaret Kennedy exhausted herself helping others in the extreme winter conditions of 1890&#150;91. Smitten by bronchitis, on 23 May 1891 she died in Acton surrounded by her family. She was buried in Hampstead, London, on 27 May.<br>
