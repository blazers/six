<span class="headword">Bond,  Ernest Radcliffe</span>  (1919&#150;2003), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born on 1 March 1919 at 58 John Street, Barrow in Furness, the son of William Edward Bond, shipyard worker, and his wife, Annie Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Radcliffe. He worked initially as an apprentice French polisher after leaving school. On 16 September 1935 he joined the 2nd battalion, Scots Guards, as a regular soldier. On 29 October, by then a sergeant, he married Mabel Phoebe Isabell Laming, the 23-year-old daughter of Alfred Thomas Laming, dock labourer; they had two sons and two daughters. Bond remained with the 2nd battalion, Scots Guards, through the early days of the Second World War, serving initially in Norway. After volunteering and serving briefly in no. 8 (Guards) commando, he was sent to north Africa with the 2nd Scots Guards. It was there in 1941 that he was recruited into L detachment of the Special Service Brigade (which later became the Special Air Service), set up by Colonel David Stirling to carry out actions behind enemy lines. On his first mission the plane carrying Bond crash-landed near Tripoli and he was captured, spending the rest of the conflict as a prisoner of war.<br>
<br>After being demobilized in 1946 Bond joined the Metropolitan Police on 25 February 1946 with the warrant number of 128434, fulfilling career plans delayed by the outbreak of war. He embarked on what was to become a very successful career in the service, based first in M division, which covered the Lambeth area of south London. In 1948 Bond was transferred to E division, covering the Holborn area of central London, as a detective. After working in the fraud squad and the flying squad he joined the murder squad as a detective inspector in 1963, and was appointed commander in 1969.<br>
<br>It was the arrival on the political scene in Britain of the Angry Brigade in 1970 that was to change Bond's career path and bring him into public prominence. The small, loosely knit anarchist organization set off a series of twenty-five bombs, none fatal, aimed at targets such as the Conservative employment secretary Robert Carr's home, police stations, army barracks, and embassies of right-wing regimes. Bond, who was given the codename Commander X by Scotland Yard for security reasons, was put in charge of the newly formed bomb squad, whose aim was to investigate who was behind the explosions. The Angry Brigade was short-lived, five members being gaoled for ten years following two trials at the Old Bailey. In one of them, Bond told the defence barrister, Ian McDonald: &#145;I regard the Angry Brigade as an idea that anyone can join.&#146; He added in his evidence that if the brigade had not been caught, &#145;I am quite certain that, sooner or later, we would have had somebody killed&#146;  (Carr, 101). One of the defendants later described Bond as &#145;an old-fashioned plod&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), which he might well have regarded as a back-handed compliment. It was clear from the court exchanges and Bond's subsequent statements that he was bemused by the motives and lifestyles of the defendants. A conventional and perhaps old-fashioned detective and, like many of his police contemporaries, an active freemason, Bond later described the trial as &#145;the most disgraceful&#146; of his experience because of the many allegations that his officers had planted evidence  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 3 Feb 2002). He was awarded the queen's police medal and promoted deputy assistant commissioner, both in 1972.<br>
<br>Bond faced a much more serious challenge when the bomb squad had to deal with the IRA, which launched its bombing campaign in London in the 1970s. As the attacks grew in daring and frequency Bond and his colleagues adopted a policy of placing large numbers of undercover officers around potential targets. In December 1975 this strategy led to the pursuit of four IRA men who for the second time had fired shots at Scotts restaurant in Mayfair. The gunmen were pursued and broke into a flat at 22a Balcombe Street in central London, where they took as hostages an elderly couple, John and Sheila Matthews. In what became known as &#145;the siege of Balcombe Street&#146; Bond played a supervisory role as six days of painstaking negotiation were carried out, leading to the safe release of the couple and the surrender of the IRA men.<br>
<br>Bond received eleven commendations from the commissioner between 1948 and 1964. These included recognition for his &#145;courage and initiative&#146; and his &#145;perseverance&#146; in cases covering larceny, forgery, false pretences, and robbery, as well as for his leadership of the bomb squad. His career was given further recognition when he was appointed OBE in the new year's honours of 1976. He retired in February that year after thirty years of &#145;exemplary conduct&#146;  (Metropolitan Police Archives). After his retirement, he lived quietly and was able to spend time on his interests in decorating and gardening. He remained an active freemason, having joined the Britannic lodge of Madeira in London in 1962 and become master of that lodge in 1969. He was a member of other lodges and achieved the office of past assistant grand sword bearer and past junior grand deacon. He died at his home, 165 Welling Way, Welling, Kent, on 20 November 2003, of prostate cancer. He was survived by his four children, his wife, Mabel, having predeceased him in 1992.<br>
