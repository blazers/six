<span class="headword">Pullen,  Henry William</span>  (1836&#150;1903), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at Little Gidding, Huntingdonshire, on 29 February 1836, the elder son of the four children of William Pullen, rector of Little Gidding, and his wife, Amelia, daughter of Henry Wright. Pullen was educated at Marlborough College from 1845 to 1848, in which year his family moved to Babbacombe, Devon, owing to his father's poor health. In the same year his father published a volume of young Pullen's verses and rhymes, called <span class="italic">Affection's Offering</span>.<br>
<br>Pullen went to Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1859 and MA in 1862. In 1859 he was ordained deacon on appointment to an assistant mastership at St Andrew's College, Bradfield, and became priest in 1860. Deeply interested in music, he was elected vicar-choral of York Minster in 1862 and was transferred in 1863 to a similar post at Salisbury Cathedral. Pullen did his chief literary work while at Salisbury. He published several pamphlets (1869&#150;72) on reform of cathedral organization and clerical unbelief, which were often viewed as pugnacious.<br>
<br>Near the end of 1870 Pullen published a pamphlet on the Franco-Prussian War entitled <span class="italic">The Fight at Dame Europa's School</span>. Here he presented the European situation as a simple parable, in which John, the head of the school (and representing England), refuses to separate Louis (France) and William (Germany), though he sees that Louis is beaten and that the prolongation of the fight is mere cruelty. John is reproached by Dame Europa for cowardice: he is told that he has grown &#145;a sloven and a screw&#146;, and is threatened with loss of his position.<br>
<br>The pamphlet was enormously successful. The first edition of 500 copies was printed at Salisbury on 21 October 1870. By 1 February 1871 29,000 copies had been issued. The Salisbury resources then became overstrained, and the publisher, Spottiswoode of London, printed 50,000 copies (1&#150;9 February). By 18 April 192,000 had appeared, and the final thousand were printed in April 1874. The pamphlet was translated into French, German, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Frisian, Swedish, Portuguese, and Jersey French. A dramatized version by George T. Ferneyhough was acted on 17 March 1871 by amateurs at Derby in aid of a fund for French sufferers. <span class="italic">The Fight</span>, which brought Pullen &pound;3000, evoked a host of replies, especially ones justifying Britain's non-involvement in the conflict. Pullen's further pamphleteering critical of the 1868&#150;74 Gladstone government was less successful.<br>
<br>In 1875 Pullen retired from Salisbury. During that year and 1876 he served in Sir George Nares's Arctic expedition as chaplain on the ship <i>Alert</i> and received on his return the Arctic medal. For the next twelve years he travelled widely on the continent, making Perugia his headquarters. The publisher John Murray, to whom he had sent useful notes of travel, appointed him editor of his popular travel guides. Fluent in five or six languages, Pullen successively revised nearly the whole of the series, beginning with north Germany. His writing continued throughout his life, focusing on political and religious pamphleteering.<br>
<br>Pullen resettled in England in 1898, and held successively the curacy of Rockbeare, Devon (1898&#150;9), and several locum tenencies. In May 1903 he became rector of Thorpe Mandeville, Northamptonshire, but died, unmarried, in a nursing home at 70 Newhall Street, Birmingham, seven months later, on 15 December 1903. He was buried at Birdingbury, Warwickshire, and a brass tablet to his memory was put up on the chancel wall of the parish church at Thorpe Mandeville.<br>
