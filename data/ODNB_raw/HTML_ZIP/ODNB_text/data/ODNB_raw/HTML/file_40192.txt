<span class="headword">Evans,  Caleb</span>  (1737&#150;1791), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and college head</span>, was born on 12 November 1737 in Bristol, the first child of Hugh Evans (1712&#150;1781), Particular Baptist minister and principal of the Bristol Baptist Academy, and his first wife, Sarah Browne (<i>d</i>. 1751), daughter of Joseph Browne of Bristol. Educated at Mile End Academy, Middlesex, Caleb received baptism as a believer at Little Wild Street Baptist Church, London, on 29 November 1753. He assisted Josiah Thompson at Unicorn Yard, London, from 15 September 1758, moving to Broadmead, Bristol, to assist his father on 12 August 1759. He was ordained co-pastor on 18 August 1767 and appointed tutor at Bristol Academy, succeeding his father as principal in 1781. Caleb married Sarah Jeffries (<i>d</i>. 1771), only daughter of the Revd Joseph Jeffries and his second wife, Miss Rickard, at St Andrew's, Pershore, on 19 April 1762; they had five children. Following her death on 7 November 1771, he married Sarah Hazle (<i>d</i>. 1817), only daughter of William and Judith Hazle of Bristol, at St James's, Bristol, on 7 December 1774.<br>
<br>Primarily Evans was concerned to provide able and evangelical ministers for English and Welsh Baptist churches. In 1770 he separated the academy from Broadmead church and put the academy on a sound financial basis as the Bristol Education Society, which provided voluntary support from individuals and churches for the education of &#145;pious candidates for the ministry &hellip; [and] the encouragement of missionaries to preach the Gospel&#146;  (C. Evans, <span class="italic">The Kingdom</span>, 1775, 24). This significant breakthrough in Baptist ministerial training led to the formation of other Baptist colleges in England and Wales. In America a Bristol student, William Staughton (1770&#150;1829), used Evans's model as the basis for Columbian College, the first American national Baptist university, now George Washington University. Evans received two honorary doctorates, one from Rhode Island College (1789), the other from King's College, Aberdeen (1790).<br>
<br>Evans's ordination statement in 1767 indicated his early commitment to the evangelical Calvinism propounded by Jonathan Edwards in America, and he commended Edwards to all his students. One student, John Sutcliff (1752&#150;1814), minister at Olney, Northamptonshire, was profoundly influenced by Evans's commendation of Edwards and initiated prayer for revival on the Edwards pattern among local Baptist churches in 1784. He introduced Andrew Fuller, founder of the Baptist Missionary Society in 1792, to Evans's <span class="italic">An Address to the Serious and Candid Professors of Christianity</span> (1772), in which Evans uses the insights of Edwards to explain the distinction between natural and moral ability in man. Fuller's <span class="italic">The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation</span> (1785), which quoted pages 11&#150;13 of Evans's book verbatim, provided the theological key to liberating English Baptists from a sterile high-Calvinism into a vibrant, worldwide, missionary community. Evans himself undertook itinerant evangelistic preaching tours with students, the first to Cornwall in 1773. In 1769 Evans and John Ash of Pershore edited <span class="italic">A Collection of Hymns Adapted to Public Worship</span>, the first congregational Baptist hymnbook, which had 412 hymns, 275 of which were by Baptists, including some by Evans's personal friend Anne Steele.<br>
<br>Evans was a Hanoverian loyalist who celebrated annually Guy Fawkes night and King William's landing at Torbay on 5 November. In his <span class="italic">Political Sophistry Detected</span> (1776), he claimed the &#145;great <i>American question</i>&#146; was intricately interwoven with &#145;the British constitution and British liberty&#146;, and that American resistance was &#145;one of the best causes in the world&#146;  (14, 35). In his <span class="italic">British Constitutional Liberty</span> (1775), he advocated radical political reform but refuted republican ideals. When John Wesley contended the king had power to tax his subjects without their consent, Evans disagreed. In <span class="italic">A Letter to Mr. Wesley</span> (1775) Evans charged Wesley with inconsistency, for in Bristol Wesley had supported an American-born radical parliamentary candidate, Henry Cruger. In addition Wesley, in his <span class="italic">Calm Address</span>, was not only guilty of serious plagiarism of Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Taxation No Tyranny</span> but also defended the legitimacy of the taxation of the American colonists, who had no parliamentary representation. In <span class="italic">A Letter to Mr. Wesley</span> Evans exposed these issues and eventually received a public apology from Wesley in <span class="italic">The Gazetteer</span> on 13 December 1775. The infamy of the slave trade was opposed vigorously in works by both authors. Among Evans's thirty pamphlets and sermons, those already listed, together with <span class="italic">The Remembrance of Former Days</span> (1779) and <span class="italic">British Freedom Realized</span> (1788), provide a comprehensive survey of his political thought.<br>
<br>In May 1791 Evans had a paralytic stroke; a second at Bristol on 9 August 1791 was fatal. His funeral at Broadmead, Bristol, was conducted by the Revd Samuel Stennett, and the Revd John Tommas spoke at the interment in Redcross Street burial-ground, Bristol, on 16 August 1791.<br>
