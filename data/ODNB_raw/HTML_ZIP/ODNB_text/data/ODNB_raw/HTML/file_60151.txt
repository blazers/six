<span class="headword">Ewart,  Gavin Buchanan</span>  (1916&#150;1995), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 4 February 1916 at 25 Norfolk Crescent, London, the first of three children of George Arthur Ewart (1886&#150;1942), gynaecologist, and his wife, Dorothy Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (1889&#150;1979). George Ewart was the son of James Cossar Ewart FRS (1851&#150;1933), Darwinist and regius professor of natural history at Edinburgh University. Gavin Ewart went to Wellesley House, a preparatory school in Broadstairs, Kent, from 1924 to 1929, and from there to Wellington College, Crowthorne, Berkshire, where he stayed until 1933.<br>
<br>Already Ewart had begun to write poetry; by the age of fourteen he had written several short plays and he contributed poetry to the Wellington <span class="italic">Year Book</span>, and also <span class="italic">Out of Bounds</span>, the magazine edited by his Wellington contemporaries Esmond and Giles Romilly; the magazine attacked the public schools as a breeding-ground of (in the Romillys' words) &#145;Reaction, Militarism and Fascism&#146;  (Philip Toynbee, <span class="italic">Friends Apart</span>, 1954, 15). <span class="italic">Out of Bounds</span> published Ewart's fourteen-verse poem &#145;The Fourth of May&#146;, written in the summer of 1934, with the opening lines:<blockquote>
<div>My dear old school goes back today,<br>
</div>
<div>Fumbling for tips and &#145;Goodbye, old boy,&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>Shall we give it a cheer?<br>
</div>
<div>Let us pray for its members, past and present,<br>
</div>
<div>Let us remember how unpleasant<br>
</div>
<div>Most of them were.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>His pungent and sarcastic farewell to Wellington included a daring reference to masturbation:<blockquote>
<div>So we were onanists; beds at night<br>
</div>
<div>Used to respond with continual slight<br>
</div>
<div>Creaks of their springs<br>
</div>
</blockquote>at the time an unmentionable subject; Ewart's poem so scandalized his housemaster that he wrote to say it would not be a good thing for Ewart to visit the school for at least three years.<br>
<br>The youthful Ewart had thus staked out some of the territory he would exploit in later years. But this he had already done with the poem that represented his first adult success, &#145;Phallus in Wonderland&#146;, written shortly after his seventeenth birthday, which Geoffrey Grigson published in <span class="italic">New Verse</span>. The poem was much influenced by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound; considering it immature, Ewart omitted it from his first published collection, <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span> (1939), but he included it in his <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1933&#150;1980</span> (1980).<br>
<br>In 1934 Ewart went up to Christ's College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner to read classics, but changed to English at the end of his first year, becoming a pupil of F. R. Leavis. He was literary editor of <span class="italic">Granta</span> for the year 1936&#150;7 and he went down in 1938 with a second in finals, hoping to follow the profession of poet; to earn a living, he did secretarial work for various authors and worked as a salesman for a firm of fine art publishers. His larger ambition seemed closer to fulfilment when the Fortune Press, under the notorious R. A. Caton, published <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span> in 1939. The most noticeable influence this time was that of W. H. Auden, whom he always considered the greatest English-language poet of the twentieth century; however, the best-known poem in the book is probably the squib &#145;Miss Twye&#146;, a ribald quatrain anticipating Ewart's later light verse.<br>
<br>War service stalled Ewart's progress as a poet. He was called up in June 1940 to the East Surrey regiment, and in May 1941 he was commissioned in the Royal Artillery. He served in anti-aircraft batteries in north Africa and Italy, and although he later denied any talent for &#145;war poetry&#146;, his <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1933&#150;1980</span> includes nine &#145;war poems&#146; written between 1940 and 1946: one of them, &#145;When a Beau goes in&#146;, became a well-known anthology piece (&#145;Beau&#146; was wartime slang for Beaufighter, the twin-engined fighter aircraft introduced in 1940).<br>
<br>Ewart was demobilized in May 1946 with the rank of captain, and soon afterwards M. J. Tambimuttu, proprietor of Editions Poetry London, took him on as production manager. Ewart was also working for the British Council, helping to select books for overseas distribution, but in 1949 the council was drastically pruned as a result of government cuts and at roughly the same time Tambimuttu went to live in the United States: Editions Poetry London collapsed. Out of a job, Ewart now began the occupation he remained in until 1971: he became an advertising copywriter. He worked for a succession of agencies&#151;Royds, the London Press Exchange, Notleys (later Saatchi and Saatchi), and finally J. Walter Thompson.<br>
<br>Ewart found the work uninteresting and the clients tiresome, and his talents as a poet were neglected, although he would sometimes write during quiet periods in the office and had occasional poems accepted by, among others, the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> and the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. Nor was he the only aspiring writer to look for a livelihood in advertising: another&#151;at Royds&#151;was the Australian &eacute;migr&eacute; poet Peter Porter. Ewart's friendship with Porter (they remained friends for the rest of Ewart's life) prompted him to start writing seriously again. Alan Ross, editor of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> and director of London Magazine Editions, persuaded him to put together the collection which appeared in 1964 with the title <span class="italic">Londoners</span>, with illustrations by Colin Spencer. This volume, consisting of verse portraits of eighteen London landmarks, was competent rather than inspired, and sold few copies.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Londoners</span> was succeeded in 1966 by <span class="italic">Pleasures of the Flesh</span>, and now Ewart's distinctive voice began to be heard in verse that was witty, nimble, comprehensible, and metrically resourceful, able to handle the erotic and the satirical with equal verve and confidence; one note clearly heard, however, is of restlessness and vexation with the dullness of his work. Matters came to a head in 1971 when J. Walter Thompson made Ewart redundant. On 24 March 1956 he had married Margaret (Margo) Adelaide Bennett (<i>b</i>. 1922), and by now they had two children, Jane Susan (<i>b</i>. 1956) and Julian Robert (<i>b</i>. 1958). Ewart took a job as a schoolmaster, and for two terms taught O and A-level English at several local schools, principally a south London comprehensive. This excursion into a new profession was not a success&#151;he found his pupils ill-motivated and mischievous&#151;but Ewart's confidence as a writer was strengthened by the Cholmondeley award for poetry in 1971, and he resolved once more to make a living as a poet. Indeed his poetic output began to increase rapidly and he was becoming a well-liked member of the literary community. Aware of his debt to Peter Porter, he dedicated to him his next book, <span class="italic">The Deceptive Grin of the Gravel Porters</span> (1968). His next volume, <span class="italic">The Gavin Ewart Show</span> (1971), is a collection of mature, confident poetry, displaying his talent for metrical dexterity and encompassing a range of feeling and personal experience. As in the next volume, <span class="italic">An Imaginary Love Affair</span> (1974), many of the poems reflect a conflict between the anguish of romantic love and the deeper satisfaction of a secure marriage; and in later volumes too, he appears to settle, or at least suppress, this conflict with the help of the bawdy wit and irreverence for sexual convention for which he was now known.<br>
<br>Ewart was elected chairman of the Poetry Society for the year 1978&#150;9 and when the Oxford professorship of poetry became vacant in 1984 he stood as &#145;the Cambridge candidate&#146;. He won few votes; Peter Levi was elected. Meanwhile he edited books of light verse, children's verse, and school songs, and the appearance in 1980 of his first collected volume (<span class="italic">The Collected Ewart</span>, dedicated to his wife) demonstrates his productiveness no less than his gifts. He was by now very much the professional poet: writing reviews and taking part in radio programmes; his work appearing in literary periodicals (the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Ambit</span>); and becoming a familiar figure at poetry readings. An awkward public performer at first, he rapidly improved; in his last decade he was acknowledged as a virtuoso reader&#151;witty yet modest, his voice melodious and his manner confident, making the most of his poetry's numerous technical stunts and devices.<br>
<br>Ewart published a second <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> covering the years 1980&#150;90, it and the 1980 volume totalling almost 900 pages. Then came in 1993 his <span class="italic">85 Poems</span>, and he continued unstoppably, writing for periodicals and in letters to his friends. Verse came to him spontaneously: &#145;found&#146; poetry, in newspapers and speech, pleased him, and so did experiments with metre and rhyme. His fluency and wit and his gleeful use of sexual imagery (he was the second most prolific contributor to <span class="italic">The Faber Book of Blue Verse</span>, 1990) usually gave him the status of &#145;light&#146; poet and he said he was &#145;most proud&#146; of the Michael Braude award for light verse which the American Academy gave him in 1991. Yet at heart his was serious poetry, admired by such contemporaries as Philip Larkin, Stephen Spender, Anthony Thwaite, Alan Brownjohn, and Peter Porter, who said of him &#145;There is simply more of the observable surface of our world in his poetry than in most of his contemporaries', and more of its humour and moral seriousness&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Ewart had been handsome as a young man and in his latter years he was still noticeably so: humorous, engaging, sociable, widely read, with many friends, and fond of music, especially 1930s jazz, Mozart, and Richard Strauss. He died of prostate cancer in Trinity Hospice, in Clapham, south London, on 23 October 1995. He was a declared atheist and a member of the British Humanist Association and he was cremated on 30 October at Putney Vale crematorium, south London. At his request, the congregation, of fellow poets and writers as well as family and friends, were played the last of Strauss's <span class="italic">Four Last Songs</span>, his setting of Joseph von Eichendorff's &#145;Im Abendrot&#146; (&#145;At dusk&#146;).<br>
