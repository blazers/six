<span class="headword">Booth, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1634&#150;1703), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a son of Sir John Booth (1602&#150;1678), of Woodford, Cheshire, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> St John, (<i>d</i>. 1655). His paternal uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2877/', "George Booth, first Baron Delamer")</script>, politician and leader of the royalist rising in Cheshire in 1659. He entered the navy, serving as a midshipman under Sir Roger Strickland in 1672 and being promoted rapidly, and at a remarkably young age, to command the fireship <i>Pearl</i> in June 1673 through the patronage of Prince Rupert; the ship was expended during the battle of the Texel on 11 August 1673. Booth commanded the fireship <i>Eagle</i> from 1675 to 1678 and, briefly, the <i>Richmond</i> in May 1678. His command of the <i>Adventure</i>, chiefly in the Mediterranean, from July 1678 to January 1683 was the making of his naval career. He married Rosamond Harrison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Littleton (<i>d</i>. 1718) of Stepney on 14 May 1685. She and their sons Edward and William and daughters Mary and Elizabeth survived him; two other children, John and Dorothy, died in 1693.<br>
<br>Booth fought several single-ship actions with larger corsair vessels, capturing the <i>Golden Horse</i> of Algiers after a ferocious fight on 8 April 1681. Booth subsequently became involved in an acrimonious dispute over the prize claim to the <i>Golden Horse</i> with Captain Wheeler of the <i>Nonsuch</i>, which had come to his assistance. Following his return to England Booth was knighted by the king on 12 November 1682. He was flag captain to George Legge, Lord Dartmouth, aboard the <i>Grafton</i> in 1683&#150;4, when Dartmouth took a fleet to evacuate and demolish England's short-lived colony at Tangier. During this time Booth became a confidant of Samuel Pepys and provided him with much information about the alleged corruption and perversions of the previous admiral commanding in the Mediterranean, Arthur Herbert, earl of Torrington. Dartmouth thought Booth &#145;a very knowing and active seaman and brave fellow&#146;, and Booth claimed that he had slept on deck for three years &#145;with nothing over him but a tarpaulin, that his seamen might be the better contented to do as he did&#146;  (Chappell, 135, 219).<br>
<br>Appointed a commissioner of the navy in February 1688, Booth became controller of the storekeeper's accounts when the Navy Board was reorganized on 12 October. He took command of the third-rate <i>Pendennis</i> on 25 September 1688 during the mobilization prompted by the invasion of William of Orange, but the success of the invasion&#151;and of his enemy Herbert&#151;made Booth consider the desperate expedient of defecting to France with his own ship and the <i>Warspite</i>. In conversation with Captain Wilford of the fireship <i>Eagle</i> on 16 March 1689 Booth claimed &#145;that he had thought of it 24 hours &hellip; let us push at our fortunes&#146;, and that no one would question his putting Wilford into the command of the <i>Warspite</i> because &#145;I am a commissioner of the navy, and who will dispute it?&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5253, fol. 132). On being rebuffed, Booth snapped &#145;damn if you won't, I'll go up and trim&#146;  (ibid.), but he was unable to conceal his intended treason and was forced to flee to France. He attempted to return to England in 1696, and despite problems over his bail and willingness to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, he was living in London again by 1697, subsequently corresponding with the Jacobite Colonel James Graham and commissioning an artist to draw his old friend Pepys. Booth had also acquired a plantation on Barbados and seems to have spent at least part of his time there between 1689 and his death at Greenwich in February 1703. He was buried at Greenwich on 18 February 1703.<br>
