<span class="headword">Thurnam,  John</span>  (1810&#150;1873), <span class="occ">psychiatrist and ethnologist</span>, was born on 28 December 1810 at Lingcroft, near York, the son of William Thurnam, manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah Clark. He belonged to a Quaker family. After a private education, which included study in London at Dermott's school of anatomy, Soho, and the Westminster Hospital, Thurnam became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1834. He also became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1843, a fellow in 1859, and graduated MD at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1846.<br>
<br>Having served as resident medical officer at the Westminster Hospital from 1834 to 1838, Thurnam was appointed medical superintendent of the Friends' Retreat in York, of which his father had been a director. He held this post until 1849. At that time the Wiltshire County Asylum was being built and Thurnam was appointed superintendent. It opened in 1851 and he remained in active charge until his death. On 18 June 1851 he married Frances Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Wyatt, a barrister, and sister of Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt (1820&#150;1877). They had three sons.<br>
<br>In 1843 Thurnam published <span class="italic">Observations and Essays on the Statistics of Insanity, and on Establishments for the Insane</span>, the work for which he is best-known. This monograph contained a reprint of the <span class="italic">Statistics of the York Retreat</span>, first issued in 1841, together with a historical sketch of that institution. Thurnam's appointment as resident medical officer was instrumental in breaking the tradition of lay therapists started by William Tuke, and mirrored a wider national trend of medical practitioners' taking over control of the care of the insane.<br>
<br>Thurnam was a founder member of the Medico-Psychological Association in 1841, and remained a committed member of the association, twice serving as president. Unusually for an asylum superintendent, Thurnam found time to research and publish. While at Westminster Hospital he had gained some reputation for his observations on aneurysm of the heart, and at the York Retreat he developed an interest in phrenology. He gave a paper entitled &#145;Scientific cranioscopy of Professor Carus&#146; at the British Association for the Advancement of Science in September 1844, and began to apply phrenological assumptions to his care of patients. As with James Cowles Prichard, another psychiatrist from a Quaker background, this area of study appears to have kindled an interest in ethnology and comparative craniology.<br>
<br>After moving to Wiltshire, Thurnam developed this enthusiasm, and with Joseph Barnard Davis published in 1865 a work in two volumes called <span class="italic">Crania Britannica</span>. In the same year he wrote an important paper, &#145;Two principal forms of ancient British and Gaulish skulls&#146;, which was reprinted from the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of the Anthropological Society of London (1, 1865). Thurnam was indefatigable in exploring ancient British barrows, and reported his findings to the Society of Antiquaries (of which he was a member) in 1869. During the later years of his life he collected a large number of skulls and objects of antiquity. The former were transferred to the University of Cambridge, the latter are in the British Museum. Although much of the craniometric and anthropometric data generated by men like Thurnam, and later in the nineteenth century by the Italian psychiatrist and sociologist Cesare Lombroso is now discredited as attempting to support theories associating biological race with levels of cultural and intellectual development, Thurnam made a significant contribution to racial typings.<br>
<br>Contemporaries considered one of Thurnam's papers to be particularly important, &#145;Synostoses of the cranial bones regarded as a race character&#146; (<span class="italic">Natural History Review</span>, 1865). Thurnam believed he had recognized the obliteration of the sutures of the skull, which he had observed in the long-headed crania of the Stone Age, but not in the short-headed crania of the Bronze Age, believing this to be a racial characteristic. Thurnam was noted to be an efficient and zealous man beloved of his patients, who was described as dapper and professional by colleagues. He died at the Chapelry of St James, Bishop's Cannings, near Devizes, Wiltshire, on 24 September 1873. His wife survived him.<br>
