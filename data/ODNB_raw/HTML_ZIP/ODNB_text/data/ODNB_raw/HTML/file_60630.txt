<span class="headword">Schwitters,  Kurt</span>  (1887&#150;1948), <span class="occ">artist and poet</span>, was born on 20 June 1887 in Veilchenstrasse, Hanover, Germany, the son of Eduard Schwitters (<i>d</i>. 1931) and his wife, Henriette (<i>d</i>. 1945); his parents had a women's outfitting shop in Theaterplatz, Hanover.<br>
<br>Although Kurt Schwitters was born in Germany, his last years were spent in Britain after he fled first from cultural anathema in Germany and then from the German invasion of Norway. In Britain Schwitters found a refuge, where he could work undisturbed and little recognized as one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century European art. The unpretentious lifestyle of his last years was characteristic of his independence of mind. He was in contact with many avant-garde groups during his life yet he carefully maintained an independent standpoint, creating his own one-man movement which he called Merz, a syllable of the name &#145;Kommerzbank&#146;, observed on a fragment of discarded and torn paper which he incorporated into a collage. Characteristically he worked with the discarded ephemera of daily life, collecting and assembling pieces of many materials into objects of beauty which now hang in many of the world's major museums.<br>
<br>A frail child, Schwitters grew up in the family home at 5 Waldhausenstrasse in the south part of Hanover, where he attended the <i>Realgymnasium</i> I. During a prolonged illness at the age of fourteen he wrote poetry and music, and in 1906 he began to paint. Subsequently he had a thorough art education at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Hanover and the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste in Dresden. He married Helma Fischer (<i>d</i>. 1945) in Hanover in 1915; they had a son, Ernst Schwitters. Engaged in war service between March and June 1917, Schwitters was soon declared unfit and sent to work as a draughtsman in a factory near Hanover. Henceforth he complemented his naturally inventive creativity with a draughtsman's disciplined precision. He perfected a collage technique which he described in 1919:<blockquote>Merz-pictures are abstract works of art. What the word Merz essentially denotes is the combining of all conceivable materials for artistic purposes and the equal technical evaluation of the individual materials. Merz-painting makes use not just of paint, canvas, brush and palette but of all materials perceptible to the eye, and of all requisite implements. At the same time it is unimportant whether or not the material was already formed for some purpose or other. A perambulator wheel, wire netting, string and cotton wool are factors having equal rights with paint. The artist creates through choice, distribution, and disassociation of the materials. (Schmalenbach, 94)</blockquote>On the other hand his work as a draughtsman in a factory made him aware of machinery and this precision is evident in his typographic designs.The slaughter and suffering of war had shaken profoundly Schwitters's faith in the loyalties and cultural norms of his generation. Despairing soldiers returned to a defeated country on the brink of revolution. By 1917 Schwitters was committed to rebellious experiment in art, rejecting any return to the patronage and values of the age which plunged Europe into the First World War. The Russian revolutions of 1917 had demanded an art which was partisan, political, and public. But the failed revolution in Germany arose from dismay, poverty, and destruction. Political artists became ferocious social critics, particularly in Cologne and Berlin. There the Dada movement, an anarchic reversal of conventional values, attacked the very concept of art. Dada recognized no authority and made a method out of contradiction. Schwitters devised his own response, Merz, in the winter of 1918&#150;19.<br>
<br>Schwitters maintained his independence by contacting many avant-garde groups throughout the 1920s, balancing them to establish a position of his own yet still remain visible as an artist. Dada was one such formation, as was De Stijl, the Dutch-based group of artists and designers which included Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg, and others. Schwitters was attracted also to the new Bauhaus by its design principles, and to international constructivism from Germany and Russia. He exhibited at Der Sturm in Berlin, an expressionist stronghold. Through the activities of the Provinzialmuseum and the Kestner Gesellschaft in Hanover, he also knew of the peripatetic Russian artist and designer El Lissitzky, who was to have a profound effect on his typographic designs. In 1924 he formed his own publicity company, the Merzwerbezentrale, characterized by designs which were practical, effective, intelligent, and legible.<br>
<br>Typographic work was perhaps the least part of Merz, however. Schwitters made more and more collages from scraps of paper, photographs, and the detritus and ephemera of his surroundings. Fragments of the printed page introduced dramatic juxtapositions of scale, font, and colour to produce new effects, later to be used in design projects. But in his collages he specialized in fragmentation: his pieces of paper, wood, buttons, and cloth were rarely whole and their messages were never complete. With these fragments of daily life he turned discarded rubbish into harmonious, suggestive, and overtly beautiful compositions.<br>
<br>In Schwitters's hands collage ranged from formal compositions of proportion and colour, to visual juxtapositions with new meanings, like the contrast of elements in a poetic metaphor. In fact Schwitters remained active as an innovative poet throughout his career. His performances were often witty and outrageous; frequently they contained no words. One poem evoked a long-postponed sneeze and ended with the breaking of a plate. His most celebrated long poem was a wordless phonetic incantation, the &#145;Ursonata&#146;, declaimed by Schwitters on many occasions. Merz activities in Hanover grew to embrace a tall construction at his home. He called it the Merzbau, an accumulation which grew through the ceiling and into the room above. It incorporated display cases of objects assembled together and even housed a live guinea-pig.<br>
<br>With the rise of Hitler and national socialism in Germany, Schwitters became insecure. In 1937 four of his works were included in the Entartete Kunst (&#145;Degenerate art&#146;) exhibition held in Munich. Thirteen other works were removed from German museums. He travelled abroad, settling in a self-imposed exile at Lysaker, near Oslo. Here he began another Merzbau. He never returned to Germany and when German forces attacked Norway he fled, arriving in Edinburgh in 1940, to spend the last seven and a half years of his life in Britain.<br>
<br>Schwitters was arrested and interned as an enemy alien at various places until he entered the detention camp in Hutchinson Square at Douglas on the Isle of Man. Such an experience was unintelligible to refugees antagonistic to Hitler, for whom Schwitters certainly had not the slightest sympathy. But at Douglas, without credit to British organizers, the camp contained so many professors, athletes, musicians, philosophers, and artists that it made a kind of university-in-exile. The Amadeus Quartet met there and an extensive programme of lectures was arranged. Schwitters performed his poems and painted portraits. Parts of the &#145;Ursonata&#146; were used as greetings between initiate inmates at the camp. The apocalyptic German painter Ludwig Meidner was also there, as was Fred Uhlman, the novelist and collector of African carvings, whose portrait by Schwitters is in the Hatton Gallery at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>On his release Schwitters moved to London, where he was received by the critic Herbert Read and the artists Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth. Here he heard of the death of his wife Helma in Hanover and the destruction of the Merzbau there. In 1945 he moved to Ambleside in the Lake District to live in peaceful seclusion with his friend Edith Thomas. At Little Langdale he began a last large construction in a stone barn, now known as the Elterwater Merzbarn. He cemented to the wall material and objects from the area to form the basis of a deep relief construction; a ceramic egg, part of a watering can, and a piece of string were caught up in a curving and colourful form suggestive of rebirth and growth in the landscape. But Schwitters died on 8 January 1948 in the hospital at Kendal without completing the project. He was buried on the 10th in Ambleside churchyard. The Abbot Hall Art Gallery at Kendal has several of his British works and in July 1965 the Merzbarn wall was moved to the Hatton Gallery at the University of Newcastle.<br>
<br>Schwitters is increasingly recognized as a profound influence in post-war attitudes to art. Every art movement involving the assemblage of discarded and used material probably owes a debt to him. Photographs which show him in his last years happy and relaxed, far from the international contacts which made him so influential, are deceptive, for he had in his pocket a cheque from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also wanted to found a new international periodical called <span class="italic">Pin</span> with the Dadaist Raoul Hausmann, then living in Limoges, and simultaneously he was working on a Merzbau construction which could have been the most ambitious of them all.<br>
