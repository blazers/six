<span class="headword">Read,  Mary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1695&#150;1721), <span class="occ">pirate</span>, was born in England, according to the account of her early life in Captain Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">History of the &hellip; Pyrates</span>. Her mother had married a sailor named Read and had a son, but the sailor disappeared, leaving her on her own. She had an affair and became pregnant again. To conceal her condition she left her husband's relatives and went to stay with friends in the country, where she gave birth to Mary Read. Some time later the son died and she decided to pass her daughter off as her son and to ask her wealthy mother-in-law for financial assistance. Mary was dressed as a boy and the mother-in-law agreed to provide a crown a week towards the child's maintenance. When the old woman died Mary was thirteen, and was sent to work as a foot-boy for a French lady. However, she tired of this menial life and, &#145;growing strong and having also a roving mind&#146;  (Johnson, 119), she went across to Flanders and joined a foot regiment as a cadet. She fought in several engagements and then fell in love with a handsome young Flemish soldier in her regiment. She revealed to him that she was a woman and they subsequently married, left the army, and set themselves up as proprietors of the Three Horse Shoes, an eating-house near Breda. Her husband died soon after this and Mary decided to assume men's clothing again and seek her fortune elsewhere.<br>
<br>After a brief spell in the army Mary Read boarded a ship and sailed to the West Indies. Her ship was captured by English pirates and she was persuaded to join their crew. In September 1717 a proclamation was issued in the name of George I that declared that any pirates who surrendered themselves should be pardoned. The crew of Mary's ship decided to take advantage of the pardon and made their way to Nassau, in the Bahamas. There Mary met up with a group of pirates led by Captain John Rackam, otherwise known as Calico Jack. One of the members of his crew was Anne Bonny, who, like Mary Read, was dressed as a man. Anne Bonny took such a liking to the handsome Mary Read that she let her know that she was a woman and was greatly disappointed when Mary admitted that she too was a woman. Considering how few women went to sea at that period it is extraordinary that two female pirates should have ended up on the same ship, but their subsequent pirating exploits are borne out by a number of documents. These include the transcript of their trial in Jamaica and a proclamation that was issued by Captain Woodes Rogers, the governor of the Bahamas, on 5 September 1720, in which he announced that John Rackam, several men, &#145;and two Women, by name Ann Fulford alias Bonny, &amp; Mary Read&#146; had stolen a 12 ton sloop from the harbour at Providence, had committed robbery and piracy, and &#145;are hereby proclaimed Pirates and Enemies to the Crown of Great Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boston Gazette</span>). Towards the end of October 1720 Calico Jack and his crew were intercepted off the coast of Jamaica by an armed merchant ship. After a brief fight in which the two women put up a spirited resistance the pirates were captured and taken ashore to Spanish Town for trial. Rackam and the men were found guilty and hanged. A separate trial of the women took place on 28 November, and they too were found guilty of piracy and condemned to death. However, &#145;the prisoners informed the Court that they were both quick with child and prayed that execution of sentence might be stayed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tryals of Captain John Rackam</span>, 19). When examined they both proved to be pregnant and thus escaped the death penalty. Mary Read died a few months later, in prison; the parish registers of the Jamaican district of St Catherine record that she was buried on 28 April 1721.<br>
