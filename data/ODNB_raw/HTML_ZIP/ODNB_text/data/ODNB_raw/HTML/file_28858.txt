<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watson,  Richard</span>  (1781&#150;1833), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and theologian</span>, was born on 22 February 1781 at Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire, the seventh of the eighteen children of Thomas Watson (1741/2&#150;1812), a saddler, and his wife, Ann Watson. Though early connected with Methodism, Thomas became a Calvinistic dissenter and gave Richard a religious upbringing among dissenters and the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. He had a good classical education, beginning Latin at the age of six, entering Lincoln grammar school in 1791, and eagerly acquiring literary and general knowledge. In 1795 he was apprenticed to a joiner in Lincoln. After being somewhat careless about religion, attendance at a Wesleyan chapel to learn arguments against Calvinism led to his conversion in 1794. Speaking in public prayer meetings led to his first sermon on 23 February 1796 aged fifteen, then to preaching in villages, sometimes in the open air. His master having released him from apprenticeship, he assisted the Wesleyan preacher at Newark, and was received as an itinerant preacher on trial in 1796 and into full connection in 1801. In 1800 he published <span class="italic">An Apology for the Methodists</span> in answer to a local Anglican attack.<br>
<br>In 1801, however, Watson's theological and philosophical reading and love of argument led to suspicions that he had denied the full divinity of Christ. Though the charge was apparently unjust and not formally presented, Watson took offence and left the Wesleyan ministry. After a failure in business, he married in 1801 Mary Henslow of Castle Donington, Leicestershire, the daughter of a Methodist New Connexion local preacher. This led him to join that denomination as a local, then as an itinerant, preacher on probation (1803) and in full connection (1807). His abilities were recognized by his appointment as assistant secretary of conference in 1805 and secretary in 1807. Meanwhile, during stationing in Liverpool (1806&#150;8) with time for study and literary work, he published a popular guide to Liverpool and expounded conservative politics as editor of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Courier</span> (1808). Poor health forced him to become a supernumerary in 1809, but he resumed his active ministry and secretaryship of conference in 1810. Meanwhile he became dissatisfied with the Methodist New Connexion's subordination of the ministry to the laity, became friendly with the leading Wesleyan Jabez Bunting, and wrote against the 1811 attempt to restrict the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>. He then resigned from the Methodist New Connexion, was soon accepted as a local preacher by the Wesleyans, and in 1812 was reinstated as a Wesleyan itinerant.<br>
<br>Wesleyans had worked overseas for many years without a formal missionary society. Stimulated by competition from existing societies, in 1813 they began forming local missionary societies and Watson became deeply involved. In 1816 he was made a connectional missionary secretary responsible for home correspondence, reports, and publications. In 1817 he drew up a plan for a national Wesleyan missionary society, accepted by the conference in 1818. He became the leading advocate and most successful speaker and fund-raiser for Wesleyan missions. His annual reports, with their persistently optimistic and triumphalist tone, did much to shape policy. From 1821 to 1827 and again in 1832 he became a full-time missionary secretary in London. His missionary concerns led him to write his <span class="italic">Defence of the Wesleyan Methodist Missions in the West Indies</span> (1817) and to support the anti-slavery campaign. He drafted the resolution in favour of emancipation adopted by the missionary committee in 1825 and by the conference in 1830. He claimed that &#145;Christianity will not snap the chains of the slave but it will melt them&#146;  (Stevenson, 566). In 1826 he was elected president of conference for that year.<br>
<br>Watson, along with Jabez Bunting and Robert Newton, was credited with introducing more style and refinement into Wesleyan pulpit oratory, his sermons being characterized by measured eloquence and a poetic use of language. A keen naturalist, he liked to descant on the beauty and harmony to be found between the natural and moral worlds.<br>
<br>Watson's theological ability was first shown in his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Eternal Sonship and the Use of Reason in Matters of Religion</span> (1818), in which (perhaps sensitive to the old charge of Arianism) he defended the traditional doctrine of the eternal sonship of Christ against Adam Clarke's denial of it. He also firmly subordinated reason to revelation, and his attack on Clarke probably helped to antagonize Clarke's admirers in later disputes. His <span class="italic">Theological Institutes</span> (1823&#150;8) was the first systematic theology by a Wesleyan, covering the evidence, doctrines, morals, and institutions of Christianity &#145;adapted to the use of young ministers and students in divinity&#146;, &#145;neither Calvinistic on the one hand nor Pelagian on the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theological Institutes</span>, preface). As an exposition of evangelical Arminianism it was certainly &#145;Wesleyan&#146;, yet it contained few references to Wesley's writings despite defending Wesley's doctrines of assurance and perfection as scriptural. These findings were, however, absorbed into an evangelical version of scholastic protestant theology, upheld by the stock &#145;evidences&#146; of miracle and prophecy. He rejected any compromise between <span class="roman">Genesis</span> and geology. He defended Wesley's teaching that perfection can be both a process and an instantaneous experience; but, unlike Adam Clarke, he preferred to see it as a gradual development.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Observations on Southey's Life of Wesley</span> (1820) Watson, while recognizing Southey's literary qualities and superiority to most of Wesley's critics, attacked him severely for charging Wesley with ambition and credulity. He saw Southey as undermining Christianity as well as Methodism by his failure to understand salvation doctrine and his naturalistic explanations of religious phenomena. Though some thought his strictures overdone, the prince regent is said to have remarked that &#145;Mr Watson has the advantage of my laureate&#146;  (Jackson, 326). In his own <span class="italic">Life of Wesley</span> (1831) Watson aimed to produce a biography for general readers, though with some original material. He saw Wesley's theology as being permanently settled in terms of justification by faith after his 1738 conversion, thereby failing to recognize Wesley's later emphasis on sanctification and perfection. He offered some cautious criticisms of the Wesley brothers, but his claim that Wesley had effectively ordained all his lay preachers (and not simply those on whom he formally laid hands) reflected later Wesleyan disputes and Anglican criticisms.<br>
<br>Though Watson was not hostile to the Church of England and liked the Anglican liturgy, he was convinced that Wesleyan Methodism was now an independent church and he upheld Wesleyan ministerial authority. Adumbrated in his <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, this authority was hammered home in his <span class="italic">Affectionate Address</span> (1829) to the protestant Methodists who favoured greater lay control. While arguing that Wesleyan rules offered safeguards against abuse of ministerial power, Watson asserted that the duties given by God to &#145;the office of a Christian pastor&#146; for oversight and discipline of the people meant that &#145;the powers needed to fulfil these [duties] are therefore of right, inalienable right, belonging to his office&#146;  (<span class="italic">Affectionate Address</span>, 7).<br>
<br>Watson's comprehensive <span class="italic">Theological and Biblical Dictionary</span> (1831) was largely a compilation from conservative authorities. The supplement to the Wesleyan hymnbook (1831) was mainly selected by him. (He favoured congregational singing rather than choirs though he cautiously allowed for organs.) He also contributed solid reviews to the <span class="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</span>. Despite some criticisms by the admirers of Adam Clarke, the conference bought his surviving manuscripts for &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Watson had stood 6 feet 2 inches since the age of fourteen. He was extremely slender, with a lofty forehead, dark brown hair, piercing eyes, and a dignified bearing. Though lively when young, in later years his emaciated appearance and reputation for coldness and reserve, especially in mixed company, were probably aggravated if not actually caused by ill health. A clear and mellow voice added force to his preaching. His biographer Thomas Jackson complained that much could not be known about Watson's inner life because he destroyed his private papers.<br>
<br>With Jabez Bunting and Robert Newton, Watson stood among the dominant figures of his generation in Wesleyan Methodism. Though prominent as a preacher and as an upholder of the high-Wesleyan view of the ministry, he was especially significant for his theology and culture. His only intellectual rival was Adam Clarke, who was more of a polymath but theologically less focused and more eccentric. Clarke was a hero to revivalist and reforming Wesleyans, and he and Watson were often seen as leaders of rival parties, apparently to Watson's regret.<br>
<br>Watson died in London on 8 January 1833 from a long-standing gall bladder and liver condition, and was buried behind City Road Chapel, London, on 15 January. His marriage to Mary, who survived him, produced two children, Thomas and Mary (who married James Dixon).<br>
