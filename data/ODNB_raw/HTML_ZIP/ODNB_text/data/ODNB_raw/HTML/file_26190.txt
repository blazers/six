<span class="headword">Squire,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">convicted traitor</span>, described himself as a scrivener when he appeared before the privy council in 1598 accused of plotting to poison the queen's saddle. According to his own testimony he took up residence in Greenwich in 1582, married in 1587, and was employed in the royal stables in 1593. In August 1595 he accompanied Drake on his last voyage. The ship <i>Frances</i> on which Squire sailed became separated from the main squadron off Guadeloupe and was captured by Pedro Tello de Guzman and taken to Spain. The English Jesuits had recently (1591) established a seminary in Seville and were in the habit of assisting indigent Englishmen in those parts. Some sort of contact was made between the protestant Squire, together with his companion Richard Rolls, and the English Roman Catholic clergy. Squire returned to England in July 1597. Almost immediately afterwards he and Rolls went to sea again on the earl of Essex's &#145;island expedition&#146; to the Azores.<br>
<br>Over a year later Squire was arrested and made prisoner &#145;unto the prison of the Compter in Wood Street, where he did so remain the space of seven weeks until he was sent from thence unto the Tower&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, 29.506). In October 1598 he was interrogated and arraigned for treason. On 23 November he was hanged, disembowelled, and quartered at Tyburn on the charge of plotting in Seville on 20 April 1597 to poison the queen and for attempting to poison the earl of Essex when he was at sea between Fayal and San Miguel on 27 or 28 September 1597. There is no official account of the trial but the state papers relate the depositions of various witnesses and the confessions of Squire extracted under torture. It was only after his death that there was published an account of his alleged activities from his first arrival in Spain until his imprisonment in the Tower. This takes the form of a letter from England to an Englishman residing in Padua. It is dated 23 December 1598 and was published in 1599; it was reprinted with minor variations in 1624, 1733, and 1862. It sometimes bears the title &#145;Authentic memoirs of Richard Walpole&#146;, but Spedding attributes it to Sir Francis Bacon, who was present when Squire was interrogated. According to this account, the Jesuit Richard Walpole converted Squire to Roman Catholicism when he was in Seville and engineered his return to England with the object of murdering Queen Elizabeth I by applying poison to the pommel of her saddle, taking advantage of his access to the royal stables. There are inconsistencies and improbabilities in this story, which is addressed more to the prejudices of a public ready to discredit Walpole and the Jesuits than to the indictment of one whom William Camden calls &#145;a petty fogging clerk&#146;  (Camden, book 4, 561).<br>
<br>Martin Aray, an English priest who was in Seville at the time of Squire's visit, wrote a refutation of this account. Admitting that it was not a total fabrication and that Squire was not completely innocent, &#145;I shew most evidently that all and everything that concerned the Jesuits and Walpole by name &hellip; is a mere fable and malicious&#146;  (Aray, p. 3<i>r</i>). Aray says that Squire was never converted but was detained by the Inquisition in a Carmelite convent at Seville because he had publicly defended protestantism. Moreover he escaped to England and was not sent by Walpole. However, according to Joseph Creswell  (BL, Egerton MS 1508, fol. 315) there was a plan to exchange Rolls and Squire for two Spaniards held in England on the plea that as converts they might be able to promote the Spanish and Catholic cause at home. But they escaped before this could be negotiated. In 1602 Thomas Fitzherbert, who had been English secretary to Philip II, published another work which absolved the Jesuits of complicity in a plot of assassination and showed the injustice of the Squire trial.<br>
<br>Although it is most probable that Squire was not guilty of all the charges laid against him, the trial served to arouse any whose loyalty to the queen might be flagging. A special order of prayer and thanksgiving was issued to celebrate the queen's escape from danger. The Squire plot lived on in history. To protestants he was a despicable traitor whose activities served to expose the perfidy of English Jesuits overseas. To Catholics he was an unfortunate creature who under torture allowed himself to become the tool of an unscrupulous government in discrediting and calumniating the Catholic cause.<br>
