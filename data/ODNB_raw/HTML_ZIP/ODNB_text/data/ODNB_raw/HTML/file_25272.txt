<span class="headword">Shaw,  William</span>  (1797&#150;1853), <span class="occ">agricultural editor</span>, eldest son of John Shaw of Bath, was born in Bath and spent two years (1813&#150;15) at Wadham College, Oxford; he was admitted to the Inner Temple on 20 June 1828 and called to the bar on 22 November 1833. He also farmed for a time in Wiltshire. He was married, but for many years separated from his wife.<br>
<br>In 1832 Shaw helped to found (with his lifelong friend, Cuthbert Johnson, as well as John and Joseph Rogerson, and Dr Blackstone) a new weekly agricultural newspaper, the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express and Agricultural Journal</span>; he edited this paper, together with the associated monthly <span class="italic">Farmer's Magazine</span>, until his departure from England in 1852. In 1838 he began <span class="italic">Johnson and Shaw's Farmer's Almanack and Calendar</span>, which was issued under that title until 1872 and had a wide circulation. Also with Johnson, in 1844 he produced <span class="italic">Principles of Agriculture</span>, an English edition of Von Thaer's original work. Under Shaw's editorship the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span> gave comprehensive coverage of agricultural markets and technical innovation in farming. His concern to effect an improved flow of agricultural information was particularly evident in his promotion of agricultural societies. From 1834 he persistently advocated a national, non-political agricultural society for England, and the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which was established in 1838 (initially as the English Agricultural Society), was largely his creation. It was Shaw who personally persuaded John Charles, third Earl Spencer, to propose the formation of the society at the pre-Christmas meeting of the Smithfield Club in 1837. Shaw was the society's first secretary, being succeeded by James Hudson in 1840.<br>
<br>Shaw also founded the London Farmers' Club in 1843 and gave great encouragement to the formation of local farmers' clubs during the early 1840s for the purpose of non-political agricultural discussion. Shaw was a strenuous advocate of a reformed system of tenant right and, with Henry Corbet (who succeeded him as editor of the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>), produced a digest of the evidence on tenant right that had been given to Phillip Pusey's select committee on the question; this became a standard reference work. Shaw's support of tenant farmers' interests was recognized by a presentation of a service of silver plate on 1 April 1850, when he was described as &#145;the Cobden of Agriculture&#146;; the previous year he had stood for parliament as a tenant-farmers' candidate in the northern division of Hampshire and, although not elected, achieved a highly creditable vote.<br>
<br>&#145;Shaw of the Strand&#146; (as he was known at the Farmers' Club) also had a number of business interests, and he was one of the chief founders (1840) and the managing director of the Farmers' Insurance Company. He was also managing director of the Farmers' and Graziers' Mutual Cattle Insurance Association, which was founded in 1844 but fell into financial difficulties in 1849. Soon afterwards Shaw sustained heavy financial losses in connection with his support for a project to relocate the Metropolitan Cattle Market at Islington instead of Smithfield, and it was these losses which caused him to flee to Australia in November 1852. After a period of extreme adversity in Melbourne he died penniless in a remote gold-prospecting area on 5 May 1853. His demise was largely ignored by his contemporaries, and for this reason Shaw never received the historical recognition as a leader of early Victorian agricultural opinion that his achievements merited.<br>
