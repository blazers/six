<span class="headword">Longrigg,  Stephen Hemsley</span>  (1893&#150;1979), <span class="occ">military governor and petroleum company executive</span>, was born on 7 August 1893 at Sevenoaks, Kent, the younger son of William George Hemsley Longrigg (1859&#150;1941), a banking official and businessman, and his wife, Kate Thorp (<i>d</i>. 1937).<br>
<br>Longrigg attended Highgate School in north London and subsequently went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1911. He read classics and obtained a first-class degree. Because of army service in the Royal Warwickshire regiment in 1914&#150;21 (major in 1918) he received his MA degree in 1921 when on home leave from Iraq. Early during his subsequent service in the Iraq government, from 1918 to 1931, he married, in 1922, Florence (1890&#150;1976), daughter of Henry Aitken Anderson. They had two sons (John and Roger) and a daughter. In the Iraq administration Longrigg rose rapidly and at an early age became inspector-general of revenue, from 1927 to 1931. In addition to his official duties he developed his authorial talents by writing a highly competent history of Iraq entitled <span class="italic">Four Centuries of Modern Iraq</span> (1925), which has not been superseded. This work established his reputation as a serious historian and orientalist. His familiarity with Iraq extended beyond its borders to the whole of the Fertile Crescent and the Arabian peninsula.<br>
<br>The success of Longrigg's first work was followed by several other books, many articles, and a steady stream of lectures throughout his life. His firsthand knowledge of the scene and personalities of the area enlivened both his felicitous pen (put to paper in a fine hand) and his remarkable fluency as a speaker. When on one occasion, during a lecture to a university audience, the lights failed, he discarded his script and continued without hesitation or pause.<br>
<br>His long service in Iraq enabled Longrigg to acquire an admirable command of Arabic. This facility served him in good stead when, from 1931 to 1951, he became a senior executive of the Iraq Petroleum Company and in this capacity negotiated oil contracts with some of the rulers of the Arabian peninsula. King Ibn Sa&#145;ud was one of the principal partners of his negotiating skills.<br>
<br>The Second World War ushered in a third career as pro-consul. Longrigg became a brigadier for the duration of the war and served on the general staff of general headquarters Cairo, mainly concerned with the preparations for the military administration of the expected occupation of the Italian colonial possessions in Africa. When he was appointed chief administrator (military governor) of Eritrea, he was fully ready for the task, which he always considered the high point of his career. For the best part of three years, from 1942 to 1944, he presided over a military (yet quasi-colonial) government which reflected Longrigg's own efficiency and humaneness.<br>
<br>Longrigg was fortunate in having on his staff a number of officers of high calibre who were skilled in colonial administration, anthropology, and some of the languages of the area. Longrigg himself was initially no expert in Ethiopian history or languages, but he acquired a knowledge of the former by remarkably skilful and eclectic reading, while for the latter he made use of his extremely serviceable Italian and his command of Arabic. Although the lowlands of Eritrea were predominantly inhabited by Muslims who knew little or no Arabic, he would insist on talking to them in that language&#151;suggesting that it was sheer quirkiness on their part to claim that they could not understand him.<br>
<br>Longrigg's governorship was undoubtedly the most prosperous as well as the most quiescent time during the eleven years of British military administration in Eritrea. In his official capacity Longrigg could be aloof and gubernatorial, with the natural air of authority which he so amply possessed, but as host at the Villa Vicereale he was relaxed and attentive to the comfort of his guests. The less cerebral among his officers might have been slightly restive during his weekly lectures, but the majority enjoyed his intellectual vigour as much as the lecturer himself did.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his governorship Longrigg wrote <span class="italic">A Short History of Eritrea</span> (1945) which, though not primarily based on independent research (as he himself stressed repeatedly), gave an excellent and succinct picture of country and people, their past and prospects for the future. His views on that future (the Christian highland provinces to go to Ethiopia, the Muslim lowlands to be annexed to Sudan) bore fruit only with regard to the former proposal.<br>
<br>On Longrigg's return to England he rejoined the Iraq Petroleum Company until his retirement in 1951. As well as accepting a number of honorary positions, he continued his literary activities at an astonishing pace. His earlier book on Iraq was now brought up to date in <span class="italic">Iraq, 1900 to 1950</span> (3rd impression, 1968) and was followed by works on oil, on the Middle East, and on Syria and Lebanon. He was much in demand as a lecturer, particularly in the USA.<br>
<br>Longrigg was appointed OBE in 1927, and in 1955 he supplicated successfully for an Oxford DLitt. He received the Lawrence of Arabia medal in 1962 and the Richard Burton medal in 1969. His wife predeceased him in 1976 and he himself died on 11 September 1979 at the Otara Nursing Home, Kingsley Green, Sussex.<br>
