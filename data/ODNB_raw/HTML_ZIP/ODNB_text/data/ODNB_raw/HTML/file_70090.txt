<span class="headword">Davies <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rees]</span>,  (Florence) Rose</span>  (1882&#150;1958), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was born at 43 Cardiff Street, Aberd&acirc;r, Glamorgan, on 16 September 1882, the second daughter in the family of four daughters and three sons of William Henry Rees (<i>b</i>. 1857/8), tinplate assorter, and his wife, Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berry (<i>b</i>. 1857/8). Six of the children became teachers. She became a monitor at Aberd&acirc;r town national infants' school in January 1896. After four years as a pupil teacher she was appointed an assistant mistress in December 1900, and was paid &pound;40 per annum. She became involved in Labour and feminist politics, probably through her teaching activities. Teachers in the town were heavily involved in the Independent Labour Party and the inequality in conditions between men and women raised issues of gender equality. She was a member of the party from 1906, possibly of the Women's Freedom League, and certainly of the Women's Co-operative Guild, of which she was local branch secretary from 1908 to 1920. In 1908 she was a shareholder in Keir Hardie's <span class="italic">Labour Pioneer</span> and of the Independent Labour Party's institute in Aberd&acirc;r.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1908 she married Edward (Ted) Davies (1879/80&#150;1951), an elementary school teacher and socialist activist, the son of John Davies, miner. She gave up her teaching position on her marriage, which led to increased work in politics and the promotion of social welfare. She was co-opted on to the education committee of Aberd&acirc;r urban district council on 5 May 1909, and in 1915 became the first female to hold its chair. She was responsible for the paragraph on educational policy in Hardie's manifesto for the election of January 1910.<br>
<br>From the evidence of his letters in her papers (1909&#150;1915, but many undated) Rose Davies and her husband had a close relationship with Hardie. Between 1910 and 1914 she moves from being addressed as Mrs Davies to &#145;Dear Comrade&#146; to &#145;Dear Rose&#146;. Some of his letters are flirtatious. She attended a number of functions as his guest and they were captured by a newspaper photographer at the zoo (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 26 March 1910). Her relations with Hardie cooled somewhat in 1912&#150;13, though this seems to have been because of pressure of work on both sides. They clearly were resumed later but she seems not to have shared his vigorous opposition to the First World War and became involved in a good deal of war work, including membership of a military tribunal and being a district representative for Glamorgan of the Women's Land Army. However, her husband travelled to Scotland for Hardie's funeral in 1915.<br>
<br>Davies gave birth to five children from 1910 onwards. This meant that her political work was mainly confined to local government. In April 1919 she stood unsuccessfully for the town ward of Aberd&acirc;r urban district council but was elected for the more working-class Gadlys ward the following year. She campaigned for improved maternity services in Aberd&acirc;r, and in 1926 spoke in favour of a birth-control clinic, to meet the needs of local mothers, whose health was put at risk by the lack of such facilities. In the face of opposition, a clinic was not established until 1931. In March 1925 she was elected to Glamorgan county council for Aberaman&#151;the first female member of the council&#151;and soon afterwards was elected an alderman. She remained a member until her death and was its first female chairman in 1949&#150;50. She took a particular interest in issues of education, particularly in provision for the education of the blind, deaf and dumb, and mentally handicapped children. In August 1920 she was appointed a justice of the peace.<br>
<br>Davies was active in the peace movement between the wars, and an admirer of George Maitland Lloyd Davies, a prominent peace activist in Wales, who briefly (1923&#150;4) held the University of Wales parliamentary seat. He spoke at a meeting at her home in 1923, when she was involved in the movement initiated by the women's section of the Welsh School of Social Service to launch a peace memorial from the women of Wales to the women of the United States, urging the USA to join the League of Nations. Presented in Washington in February 1924, the memorial was supported by 400,000 signatures. Marion Phillips nominated her to attend a meeting of the League of Nations in Geneva in September 1930. In the general election of 1929 she stood as Labour parliamentary candidate for Honiton in Devon. It was a hopeless prospect: Labour had never contested the seat before and she was unknown there. In a triangular contest she came third and won just 2.6 per cent of the vote. She was also a member of many committees, including Labour's standing joint committee of working women's organizations and the Board of Health Welsh consultative committee (from 1919 to 1926), and of the Welsh National Memorial Association for the cure and prevention of tuberculosis. In July 1931 she was appointed to the departmental committee of garden cities.<br>
<br>Davies's regular attendance at meetings throughout south Wales, often several in one day and always through the use of public transport, became famous. Her ceaseless activity was recognized by her appointment as MBE in 1934 and CBE in 1954. Her husband, Ted, was a retired headmaster and very prominent in the Cooperative Society in the town but when he died in 1951 the local paper felt the need to identify him as the husband of Rose Davies. She died at the Royal Infirmary, Cardiff, on 6 December 1958, having collapsed a month earlier on her way to a Glamorgan county council committee meeting. Apart from her friend and colleague Elizabeth Andrews, she was the most prominent woman in the Labour Party in Wales in the first part of the twentieth century and a key representative of its claim to be the party of women.<br>
