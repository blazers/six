<span class="headword">Clarke,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1820), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, is of unknown parentage and background. He first appears as an articled clerk to an attorney in Northampton. According to a story related by his son he gave up that situation after an unpleasant episode in which he spent an entire night trying to find a substitute to conduct a hanging, as the hangman and the sheriff were unavailable for that duty. By morning he had been successful but he realized that the law was not his calling. The erstwhile lawyer then applied to the noted Baptist preacher and teacher the Revd John Collett Ryland (1723&#150;1792) for a position in his academy in Northampton. There he taught writing and arithmetic, and he was joined for a time by the scholar George Dyer (1755&#150;1841), who taught classical languages. Ryland closed his school in 1785, upon moving to London. His son, who had taught there also, continued to minister to his father's congregation in Northampton.<br>
<br>Ryland found a property in Enfield, where in 1786 he opened a new academy. Clarke went with the family to Enfield, having successfully courted the master's stepdaughter Ann Isabella Stott (<i>d</i>. 1853). They were married in January 1787, and their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5489/', "Charles Cowden Clarke (1787&#150;1877)")</script>, writer, was born at the school in December. The school became very popular, and Clarke assumed a major role in its operation, teaching upwards of a hundred pupils, who mainly were the sons of London tradesmen. The buildings had been constructed about a century earlier by a West Indies merchant. The schoolroom, formerly the stable and coach house, was set apart from the house, which Charles remembered as &#145;airy, roomy, and commodious, the grounds sufficiently large to give space for flower, fruit, and vegetable gardens, playground, and a paddock of two acres, affording pasturage for two cows that supplied the establishment with abundant milk&#146;  (Clarke and Clarke, 2&#150;3). In the 1840s, after the school had closed, the house was converted to a railway station, and later still its distinctive brick fa&ccedil;ade was preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
<br>When John Ryland died, in 1792, Clarke became the sole proprietor of the school. Charles became his father's assistant teacher just before the time that John Keats arrived as a pupil in 1803. Charles remembered his father as a progressive teacher, one who refused to cane his students and who in other respects was &#145;far in advance of his time&#146;  (Clarke and Clarke, 4). John Clarke devised a grading system by which the marks were recorded by each boy in an account book; these were tallied at every half-year interval, with rewards given for the best performance. Separate prizes were instituted for extra translations in French and Latin, which the young Keats remembered as a particular incentive to his developing interest in books.<br>
<br>Clarke was familiar with some notable learned figures of his day, including Dr Alexander Geddes, the Roman Catholic translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>; Joseph Priestley, the dissenting scientist and political theorist; and Richard Warburton Lytton, an enlightened gentleman who offered asylum to a number of French exiles, including an &eacute;migr&eacute; priest, Abb&eacute; B&eacute;liard, who briefly taught at Clarke's school. In his recollections Charles remembered his father's interest in Leigh Hunt's liberal newspaper <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, from its first issue in 1808. Clarke was sympathetic to the advanced political ideas of his day and, whether or not these views influenced his school or his pupils, he was an obviously successful teacher of a popular school when, in 1810, he retired and moved to Ramsgate. He died there, at his home, Belle Vue House, on 19 December 1820.<br>
