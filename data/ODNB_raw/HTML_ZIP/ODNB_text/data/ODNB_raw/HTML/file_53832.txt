<span class="headword">Cooper,  John</span>  (1833/4&#150;1920), <span class="occ">animal trainer</span>, was born in Bread Street, Birmingham, the son of a well-known carrier. Orphaned at the age of ten, he ran away with Hilton's menagerie. After a spell with Manders's menagerie, he became apprenticed to the animal trainer Thomas Batty. In 1852, with Batty in Leeds, Cooper distinguished himself by coolly securing the collar of a lion which had broken free. Batty's men had stood by, paralysed with fear, and Mrs Batty fainted. He was billed the next day as &#145;the youngest lion Tamer in the world&#146;. Eventually his fame as a lion tamer reached the continent, and he joined the German menagerist Renz. Altogether he spent seventeen years abroad, visiting every town of note in Europe. In 1871 he was presented with a carved pipe by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. In addition to his group of lions, Cooper became the proprietor of trained elephants. After returning to Britain, in the mid-1870s he joined James W. Myers's American circus, and remained with them until Myers sold up in 1882. Cooper then decided to retire, and sold his animals in 1883, but his love of the profession was so strong that he joined Edmonds's (previously Wombwell's) menagerie, as a trainer and exhibitor. With Edmonds he travelled England, Wales, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. His performances with the lions and leopards, in each cage, lasted twenty minutes and people stood spellbound.<br>
<br>Cooper was a gentle, quiet, and unassuming man whose wonderful control over his animals was legendary. He was the surest tamer of his day, dispensing with all kinds of glitter, and performed in plain evening dress, often without even a switch in his hand. He had a large, dark beard, and beautiful blue eyes. Eventually he retired to Penzance, but then he returned to the midlands, first to Cotteridge, Birmingham, and finally to a commodiously furnished house in Wolverhampton, surrounded by an extensive library, oil paintings, and presentations from crowned heads. He was said to have owned property in Birmingham. He died, unmarried, on 15 April 1920, at his home, 2 Cleveland Road, Wolverhampton; according to his death certificate he was eighty-six. He was buried at Penn Fields.<br>
