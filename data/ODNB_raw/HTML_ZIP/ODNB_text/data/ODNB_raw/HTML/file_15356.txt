<span class="headword">Kenealy,  Edward Vaughan Hyde</span>  (1819&#150;1880), <span class="occ">barrister and writer</span>, was born on 2 July 1819 at Nile Street, Cork, the first of four children of William Kenealy, shopkeeper, and his wife, Catherine. His parents were Roman Catholics, but at university he abandoned the Catholic faith. After attending several private schools at Cork, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 July 1835. In 1840 he graduated BA, in 1846 LLB, and in 1850 LLD. He was called to the Irish bar in 1840, and joined the Munster circuit. He offered to contest the parliamentary representation of Trinity College, Dublin, on repeal principles in June 1847, of Kinsale in February 1848, and of Cork in late 1849, but received too little support to persevere. Meanwhile he became a student of Gray's Inn on 13 January 1838, and paid several visits to London before he was called to the English bar on 1 May 1847. In that year he settled in London, becoming a queen's counsel and a bencher of his inn in April 1868. He joined the Oxford circuit, and attended sessions at Shrewsbury and at the central criminal court. In 1848 he defended Francis Looney and William Dowling on charges of treason-felony, and was subsequently junior counsel for the defence of William Palmer, the Rugeley poisoner. In 1850 he was prosecuted by the guardians of the West London Union for punishing with undue severity Edward Hyde, his six-year-old illegitimate son. He was sentenced to a month's imprisonment. On 29 November 1851 he married Elizabeth (1834/5&#150;1922), daughter of William Nicklin, a builder, of Tipton, Staffordshire; they had eleven children, including the writer and physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50057/', "Arabella Madonna Kenealy")</script>.<br>
<br>In December 1867 Kenealy defended the Fenians Burke and Casey, but after the Clerkenwell explosion he retired from the case; and in 1869 he led the prosecution of Overend, Gurney, and others for conspiracy to publish a fraudulent banking prospectus. In 1868 he unsuccessfully contested Wednesbury as an independent candidate. In April 1873 he succeeded William Campbell Sleigh as leading counsel for the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20855/', "Tichborne claimant")</script>, whose case he conducted with violent partisanship, which has been sometimes attributed to ill health (he suffered from diabetes). He made groundless imputations against witnesses and various Roman Catholic institutions, treated the bench with contempt, and protracted the case into the longest trial at <i>nisi prius</i> on record. The jury appended to their verdict a censure of the language he had employed. He then started a scurrilous paper called <span class="italic">The Englishman</span>, which attained a large circulation, to plead the cause of the claimant.<br>
<br>Kenealy's conduct during and after the trial was brought before the professional tribunals, and he was expelled from the mess of the Oxford circuit on 2 April 1874, dispatented by the lord chancellor, and disbenched and disbarred by Gray's Inn on 17 August 1874. Intent on publicizing his own and his client's grievances, he founded the Magna Charta Association and toured the country, delivering lectures on the Tichborne trial. After receiving numerous invitations to contest Stoke, Kenealy was actually elected MP for that borough on 16 February 1875, by a majority of nearly 2000 votes. On 18 February he took his seat; contrary to custom, no members introduced him to the house, the ceremony being dispensed with on the motion of Disraeli. On 23 April Kenealy moved for a royal commission of inquiry into the conduct of the Tichborne case, but beyond his own and his co-teller's, he obtained only 1 vote; there were 433 against him. Kenealy cut no figure in parliament; he contested Stoke again at the general election of 1880, and came bottom of the poll. Meanwhile, however, under Kenealy's leadership, the Magna Charta Association became a leading popular radical organization demanding triennial parliaments, votes for women, the abolition of income tax, and duties on tea, coffee, and sugar. Kenealy inspired, among others, the socialist Henry Hyndman.<br>
<br>Kenealy was a great reader and a voluminous writer, of varied and considerable learning. His poems contain translations from Latin, Greek, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Irish, Persian, Arabic, Hindustani, and Bengali, but he was probably not an accomplished scholar in all these tongues. His poems were published both in book form and in leading periodicals such as <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. He carried the extravagance and unconventionality which had wrecked his legal career into his spiritual life, fabricating from ancient texts an extraordinary mystic religion of his own: he believed he was the twelfth messenger of God, part of a line that included Adam, Jesus Christ, and Ghengis Khan. Kenealy wrote a series of theological works starting with <span class="italic">The Book of God: the Apocalypse of Adam-Oannes</span> in 1866 in which he set out his religious views. A more conventional publication was his biography of <span class="italic">Edward Wortley Montagu</span> (1869); he was also the editor of a nine-volume edition of the Tichborne trial account.<br>
<br>Kenealy died on 16 April 1880 of heart failure and diabetes at his home, Stoke House, 6 Tavistock Square, London, and was buried on 22 April in the church at Hangleton, Portslade, Sussex. He was survived by his wife. The Magna Charta Association, led by Kenealy's son, Maurice, lasted for another six years. Although Kenealy enjoyed only limited success as a lawyer and litt&eacute;rateur, he became for a brief period one of the most dynamic political demagogues between the end of Chartism and the rise of socialism.<br>
