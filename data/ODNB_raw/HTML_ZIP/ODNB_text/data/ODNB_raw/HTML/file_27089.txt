<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas Glanville</span>  (1804&#150;1848), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born at Ashburton, Devon, on 22 November 1804, the son of Thomas Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1772) and his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glanville. In 1807 his father was employed as an assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and was persuaded by the astronomer royal, John Pond, to divert his son from an intended career in medicine to one in astronomy. The young Taylor joined the observatory in 1820 and in August 1822 was given responsibility for making the nightly transit observations. His skill and reliability as an observer was such that Sir Edward Sabine recruited him as an assistant in his pendulum observations. Meanwhile, Taylor devoted his spare time to calculations for Groombridge's star catalogue, and also compiled and published ephemerides for some of the asteroids and minor planets.<br>
<br>Taylor's reward for these labours was his appointment as director of the East India Company's observatory at Madras, founded in 1819. He arrived there on 15 September 1830, with a set of apparatus by Dollond consisting of a 5 foot transit, a 4 foot mural circle, and a small equatorial telescope. Early in 1831 he began work with four Indian assistants, whom he trained to maintain the programme of observations during his obligatory absences on the trigonometrical survey of India. He married on 4 July 1832 Eliza Baratty, the daughter of Colonel Eley CSI; they had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1837 Taylor began a magnetic survey of southern India with John Caldecott, the astronomer at Trivandrum observatory, with Caldecott taking the western coast and Taylor the eastern; they went south from Madras, taking magnetic observations every 25 miles, crossing the magnetic equator and thence to Trivandrum. By this time they realized that their instruments were defective and, after having repairs effected locally, they took fresh observations on their northward passage, obtaining the first detailed picture of this magnetically important region.<br>
<br>During the years 1831&#150;9 Taylor published five volumes of astronomical observations, and in 1844 issued the <span class="italic">Madras General Catalogue</span> of 11,015 stars for the epoch 1 January 1835, a production later praised by Sir George Airy as the greatest catalogue of modern times for the number of observations, the number and distribution of stars, and for the fact that the work had been entirely carried out in one place, under Taylor's supervision. His determination of the longitude of Madras was of value to navigators, though in need of further correction when submarine telegraphy made this possible. He also observed Halley's and Wilmot's comets. His observations were generally regarded as the first of satisfactory accuracy from this region.<br>
<br>Taylor visited England in 1840 to restore his health and returned to Madras in 1841. Already a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, on 10 February 1842 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, while staying at Trivandrum observatory, his poor sight led to an accident from which he never fully recovered. About 1845 the East India Company dispatched a set of meteorological instruments to him, but it was not until late 1846, when he was convalescing in the Nilgiri hills, that he was able to organize a meteorological station there, at 8640 feet above sea level, with a bungalow for an observer.<br>
<br>Taylor returned to England on 4 April 1848 to see his daughter, who was gravely ill; she died the following day. Taylor himself was suffering from a wasting disease, and he died at 11 Hanover Buildings, All Saints, Southampton, on 4 May 1848. His widow, bereft of support for herself and her young family pending the probate of Taylor's will and the return of his possessions from India, appealed to the East India Company for assistance. She was granted &pound;50 temporary relief, but the company declined further payment.<br>
