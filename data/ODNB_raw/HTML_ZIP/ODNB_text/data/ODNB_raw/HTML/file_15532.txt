<span class="headword">Killigrew,  Charles</span>  (1655&#150;1724/5), <span class="occ">theatre manager and master of the revels</span>, was born at Maestricht on 29 December 1655. He was the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15538/', "Thomas Killigrew (1612&#150;1683)")</script>, dramatist, groom of the bedchamber (1661&#150;83), and master of the revels (1673&#150;7), and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1716), his second wife, the daughter of Johan van Hesse of Holland, and keeper of the sweet coffers to Catherine of Braganza. Charles Killigrew's elder half-brother, Henry, was a notorious rake and groom of the bedchamber to Charles II; his younger brother by Thomas's second marriage, Robert Killigrew, was a brigadier-general, killed at Almanza in 1707. Charles and his brothers by this marriage were naturalized by act of parliament in 1662.<br>
<br>Charles Killigrew received a grant of the reversion to the mastership of the revels, after Sir Henry Herbert and his father, Thomas, in 1668. In 1670 Thomas Killigrew set up a trust by which Charles would, at his father's death, receive a double share in the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane and, upon his majority, its government. Throughout this period, the theatre experienced recurrent financial difficulties and labour disputes. Early in 1676 Thomas Killigrew persuaded Charles to act as a mediator with the actors in return for the former's patent and interest in the theatre. After the elder Killigrew failed to relinquish these, Charles sued in chancery. The verdict returned on 22 February 1677 forced Thomas Killigrew to turn the company over to his son. Two days later Charles Killigrew was appointed master of the revels, in which post he served until his death. Since the position paid but &pound;10 per annum, his main source of income from it came from the exclusive right to license stage plays, rope-dancers, ballad singers, and other public shows. He triumphed in a dispute with the comptroller of the revels over this right in 1688, but eventually lost the power to license plays in the grant to Sir Richard Steele of 1715. As master of the revels, Killigrew infuriated Colley Cibber by his overly enthusiastic embrace of Jeremy Collier's view of theatrical reform: [He] &#145;assisted this Reformation with a more zealous Severity than ever. He would strike out whole Scenes of a vicious or immoral Character, tho' it were visibly shewn to be reform'd or punish'd&#146;, most notably deleting the entire first act of Cibber's <span class="italic">Richard the Third</span> on the grounds that its melancholy portrait of Henry VI &#145;would put weak People too much in mind of King James then living in France&#146;  (Cibber, 1.275, 276).<br>
<br>According to his father's biographer, Charles Killigrew &#145;became a courtier, a man-about-town, a friend of Dryden, and, in spite of apparent literary interests, a very unsuccessful theatre manager&#146;  (Harbage, 124&#150;5). This last was despite his capacity for sharp practice towards both fellow shareholders and actors. Partly as a result of their complaints and his lack of financial success, he was by the mid-1690s less active in management. Though he assisted Christopher Rich's rise to power over the united companies, he eventually became an opponent, trying unsuccessfully to have him removed from control of Drury Lane in 1701&#150;2. Given his apparent capacity to offend, it is perhaps not surprising to learn from Luttrell of a duel in January 1693 between &#145;one Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Killigrew of the playhouse&#146;  (N. Luttrell, <span class="italic">A Brief Historical Relation of State Affairs</span>, 6 vols., 1857, 3.25).<br>
<br>Killigrew was named a gentleman of the privy chamber in October 1670, a gentleman usher of the privy chamber to Catherine of Braganza on 22 November 1682, a commissioner of prizes in 1707, and comptroller of the receipts and payments of the receiver general of customs in 1716. His political sympathies seem to have been whiggish: this would explain the timing of several of the above appointments; his dismissal from the queen dowager's household by the earl of Feversham in August 1697 for &#145;show[ing] a zeal for this government&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1697</i>, 287); and his failed contest of the parliamentary representation of Orford against two tories in 1701.<br>
<br>Killigrew married Jemima, niece of Richard Bokenham, mercer, of London. She survived her husband who was buried in the Savoy on 8 January 1725. They had three sons: the eldest, Guildford, was a lieutenant in Lord Mark Kerr's regiment of dragoons during the War of Spanish Succession and a page of honour to the king from 1714 to 1727. He died childless in 1751. Their second son was the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15539/', "Thomas Killigrew (bap. 1694, d. 1719)")</script>. A third son, Charles, inherited the estate at Thornham Hall and his father's interest in the playhouse at Drury Lane and died childless on 9 March 1756.<br>
