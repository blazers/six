<span class="headword">Ashwell,  George</span>  (1612&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 8 November 1612 in the parish of St Martin Ludgate, London, where he was baptized a week later, the son of Robert Ashwell of Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex. He was admitted a scholar of Wadham College, Oxford, on 2 July 1629, aged sixteen, matriculating on 30 October of the same year and graduating BA on 4 December 1632. He proceeded MA on 27 June 1635 and three days later was elected probationary fellow of the college; this election was confirmed the following year, and he became a full fellow of Wadham on 1 July 1636. He served as college librarian in 1636 and as sub-warden in 1644 and 1647. He earned a reputation, according to Anthony Wood, as &#145;a noted tutor&#146; and &#145;a quiet and pious man &hellip; well read in the fathers and schoolmen&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.396).<br>
<br>During the civil war Ashwell preached before the royal court assembled at Oxford. He proceeded BD just before the surrender of the city to the parliamentarian forces in the summer of 1646. Ashwell was a convinced royalist, who owned a manuscript copy of Sir Robert Filmer's <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, and at whose suggestion Peter Heylin wrote <span class="italic">Parliament's Power in Laws for Religion</span>. Ashwell's fate after the fall of Oxford is uncertain. According to Anthony Wood he submitted to the parliamentary visitors in 1648. However, according to their records he had not done so by May. Whether he was formally ejected or not, by about 1650 Henry Hammond, a leading figure in the beleaguered Anglicanism of the interregnum, was trying to place Ashwell as chaplain to the royalist Lord Leigh of Stoneleigh. When Hammond was silenced in his ministry at Westwood, Worcestershire, at the end of 1655, Ashwell served as his curate and, Hammond noted, &#145;preacheth much better then this auditory hath for a long time heard any&#146; by reading the sermons of Robert Sanderson  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 34). In August 1657 Ashwell was living at Thame Park, the home of Thomas Wenman, second Viscount Wenman, a protector of sequestered Anglican clergymen, when he wrote a letter to Richard Baxter. In the course of the letter, a mild protest against Baxter's criticism in print of his <span class="italic">Fides apostolica</span> (1653), Ashwell expressed his respect for Baxter's broad-based Worcestershire Voluntary Association of Ministers. This he regarded &#145;as a Thing well meant, &amp; as a good tollerable expedient for the present, to recollect the scattered limbs of a broken Church, and fortify the Ministry against its common Enemies&#146; a means of &#145;closing up the Breaches which Schisme had made&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.262).<br>
<br>In 1658 Ashwell was admitted to the rectory of Hanwell, Oxfordshire, by the triers, a living he held beyond the Restoration and until his death. There he displayed the same self-effacing piety he had shown at Oxford, writing to Bishop Fell about his parishioners that &#145;I conceive that I have done more good among them by my Discourses and Admonitions in private, than by my preaching in public&#146;  (Clapinson, 19). He was notably gentle in his attempts to deal with the nonconformists in his parish, declaring in his will that he had &#145;an unfeigned pity towards the persons of the seduced&#146;  (ibid., 136).<br>
<br>Ashwell's writings sustain the impression of a quiet, unassuming, fair-minded man. They are almost completely lacking in the sharp polemical edge found in the works of many of his contemporaries. <span class="italic">Fides apostolica</span>, based on lectures given at Wadham, was a defence of the direct apostolic authorship of the so-called apostles' creed. Ashwell was gracious to more critical writers who opposed such an archaic view. In this work Ashwell, foreshadowing future concerns, referred to Socinianism (a radical anti-trinitarian theology of continental origin) as &#145;a compendium of heresies&#146;. <span class="italic">Gestus eucharisticus</span> (1663), a discussion of the posture to be adopted in receiving holy communion, was similarly even-handed. Ashwell argued for the propriety of kneeling to receive the eucharistic species but with characteristic fairness conceded that this was by no means a universal or constant practice of the Church.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">De Socino et Socinianismo dissertatio</span> (1680) was part of a much larger work, <span class="italic">De judice controversiarum et catholicae veritatis regula</span>, never published in its entirety (according to Ashwell for reasons of cost and uncertainty of popular appeal). Ashwell described Socinianism as a hydra, and noted that Socinian books were being eagerly read by scholars. While acknowledging the goodness of the eponymous Sozzini (Socinus), a concession which few if any of his more polemical comrades were prepared to make, he was clearly alarmed by the effects of Socinian teaching. Far from perfecting the Reformation, a common Socinian defence, Ashwell feared they risked dragging up the wheat along with the tares.<br>
<br>His translation, <span class="italic">The History of Hai Eb'n Yockdan</span> appeared in 1686. Among other aims, Ashwell hoped that the work of this &#145;self-taught philosopher&#146; would be a corrective to the burgeoning rationalism of his contemporaries, by showing how, properly exercised, &#145;humane Reason, improved by diligent Observation and Experience, may arrive to the knowledge of natural things, and from thence to the discovery of Supernaturals; more especially of God, and the Concernments of the other World&#146;  (title-page). This same concern surfaced in his last work, the only section published of the larger <span class="italic">De judice</span>, published as <span class="italic">De ecclesiae Romana dissertatio</span> (1688), which attempted to discern the rule of right reason in matters of religion. Ashwell died in his rectory at Hanwell on 8 February 1694, and was buried in the parish church.<br>
