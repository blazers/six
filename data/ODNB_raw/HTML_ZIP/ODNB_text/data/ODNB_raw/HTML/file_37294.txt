<span class="headword">Clough,  Charles Thomas</span>  (1852&#150;1916), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in Huddersfield on 23 December 1852, the third of four sons and fifth of six children of Thomas William Clough, solicitor and later an alderman, of South Parade, Huddersfield, and his wife, Amelia Jane, daughter of James Ibeson, surgeon. He was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated first class in the natural sciences tripos in 1874, proceeding MA in 1878. On graduating he joined the Geological Survey in 1875, working in the Teesdale and Cheviot districts until 1884, when he was posted to the survey's Edinburgh office. In 1881 he married Anne Mary, daughter of Thomas Durham Usher, gentleman. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>On Clough's appointment in Scotland he formed part of a group of geologists who, in the period before the First World War, were internationally without parallel for their original insights into metamorphic and igneous rocks and the intricate problems of structural geology. On his promotion to district geologist in 1902, he became the leader of that group. He made major contributions to the geology of Dalradian rocks along the highland border between Callander and Loch Lomond and in the Cowal district of Argyll. In Wester Ross, western Inverness-shire, and on Skye he unravelled the intricate metamorphic and structural history of the Moine schists and Lewisian gneisses, and on Mull he demonstrated complicated, intrusive, igneous relationships in the Tertiary Igneous Complex.<br>
<br>Clough's particular strength lay in the meticulous detail in which he recorded field data. His contemporaries considered him a master of geological field-mapping techniques and his original maps of many parts of Scotland confirm his observational skills and his ability to locate himself in the wilderness with astounding accuracy. However, his passion and concern for minutiae may have diminished the impact that his work had on his contemporaries and successors. The detail recorded on his maps was extended into his writings, where his conclusions about many geological relationships, later taken for granted but then original and often fundamental, were hidden in a mass of detailed evidence and justification.<br>
<br>The obscuring by detail of some of Clough's more fundamental and original conclusions may have resulted in formal recognition of his contributions coming rather late in his life, although he was awarded the Murchison medal of the Geological Society in 1906 and was president of the Geological Society of Edinburgh from 1908 to 1910. It was not until the year of his death that he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and awarded an honorary LLD by St Andrews University.<br>
<br>Clough was small with disproportionate strength and powers of endurance. He had golden-brown hair and beard and a voice high in pitch but rich in timbre. He had dogged determination and was of undeviating rectitude, although without well-defined religious beliefs. He had a profound influence at a personal level on his contemporaries. Clough died at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 27 August 1916 of injuries sustained three days earlier in a railway accident while examining rocks in a narrow cutting. He was buried on 30 August in Lasswade churchyard. He was commemorated by creation of the Geological Society of Edinburgh's Clough memorial medal, awarded annually to geologists who have done significant original work in Scotland or northern England.<br>
