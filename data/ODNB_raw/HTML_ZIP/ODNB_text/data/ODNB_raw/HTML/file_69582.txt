<span class="headword">MacDonnell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>O'Neill]</span>,  Rose</span>, marchioness of Antrim  (1631&#150;1695), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of Sir Henry O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1638), from one of the pro-English cadet branches of the O'Neills of Clandeboye, and Martha Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1678), daughter of the English administrator and governor of Ulster Sir Francis Stafford. On her father's side she was related to local native Irish families, including Sir Arthur Magennis, later Viscount Iveagh, and the MacDonnells of Antrim. Rose had three brothers and one sister but since her siblings were declared insane she inherited, on her father's death in 1638, his estates of Edenduffcarrick (also known as Shane's Castle) in the barony of Toome, co. Antrim. Though the details are obscure Rose spent some time at the Caroline court, and in 1642 she accompanied the eleven-year-old Princess Mary to Holland after her marriage to William II of Orange. As a protestant Rose appears to have spent most of the civil wars of the 1640s on her estates in co. Antrim, which were spoiled by the Scottish soldiers garrisoned on them. Despite this the property allegedly brought in an annual rental of &pound;1600, even during the 1650s.<br>
<br>In 1653 Rose married, as his second wife, the Catholic statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17462/', "Randal MacDonnell, marquess of Antrim (1609&#150;1683)")</script>, whose vast patrimony had been confiscated. Despite this Antrim enjoyed favour with the Cromwellians and in 1655&#150;6 Rose was allotted 26,664 Irish acres of good quality land &#145;with convenient accommodation&#146; in Connaught. There is no evidence to suggest that she ever left Ulster and she appears to have lived at her husband's seat at Dunluce. After the Restoration she lobbied vigorously for the return of her husband's estates and mortgaged chunks of her own property in an attempt to help him pay off his vast debts. Between 1665, when Antrim was restored to his patrimony, and his death on 3 February 1683, the couple divided their time between their various properties in east Ulster and involved themselves primarily in local affairs. In January 1690 one society gossip reported that a Monsieur Schomberg had married Rose. Presumably Rose met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24822/', "Frederick Herman Schomberg, duke of Schomberg (1615&#150;1690)")</script>, commander and chief of the Williamite forces in Ireland, during the late summer of 1689, when his troops were garrisoned in east Ulster. An extant order from Schomberg, dated August 1689, required &#145;all officers, soldiers and all others &hellip; not to molest Lady Antrim or any of her tenants &hellip; either in their persons or estates&#146;  (Glenarm Castle MSS). Their alleged union proved short-lived since Schomberg perished at the battle of the Boyne six months later. No doubt Rose also used her earlier contacts with the house of Orange to ensure that her relatives, including her brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17457/', "Alexander MacDonnell, third earl of Antrim")</script>, suffered as little as possible as a result of the Williamite confiscations after 1689. Rose died, childless, on 27 April 1695 and her estate passed to John O'Neill, her first cousin, who had intermarried with a cadet branch of the MacDonnells. She was buried in the church of St Nicholas, Carrickfergus, beside her parents and her grandfather.<br>
