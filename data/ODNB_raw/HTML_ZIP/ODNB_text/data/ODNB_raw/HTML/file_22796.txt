<span class="headword">Primrose,  Gilbert</span>  (1566/7&#150;1642), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born in Edinburgh in late November 1566 or 1567, the son of Gilbert Primrose (<i>c</i>.1535&#150;1615) of Culross, Perthshire, principal surgeon to James VI, and his wife, Alison Graham. In 1587 he entered St Andrews University, where he graduated MA. He then went to France, and in August 1596 was received as a minister of the French Reformed church. His first charge was at St Jean d'Ang&eacute;ly, Mirambeau, in the province of Saintonge, where he married Elizabeth Brenin (<i>c</i>.1567&#150;1637) and where his first two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22798/', "James (or Jacques) Primrose (1600&#150;1659)")</script> and David, were born. In February 1603 he was transferred to the large and important church of Bordeaux.<br>
<br>However, Primrose maintained his contacts with Scotland and its ministers, and it was mainly through his influence that John Cameron (<i>d</i>. 1625) was made regent in the new college of Bergerac. The national synod of the Reformed church, which met at La Rochelle in March 1607, appointed Primrose to wait upon John Welsh and other Scots ministers who had been banished, and to inquire into their financial needs. At this synod Primrose presented letters from King James and from the magistrates and ministers of Edinburgh recalling him home to serve the church in that city. The synod entreated him to consider the interests of his present charge, &#145;which, by his most fruitful preaching and exemplary godly conversation, had been exceedingly edified&#146;  (Quick, 1.290), and he was induced to remain at Bordeaux. In the latter part of the same year he visited Britain, when he was commissioned by the Reformed congregation at La Rochelle to ask King James to set at liberty Andrew Melville, who was then a prisoner in the Tower of London, and to allow him to accept a professorship in their college. The request was refused, and the application gave offence to the French court. On his return Primrose was called before the king of France, and the people of La Rochelle were reprimanded for communicating with a foreign sovereign without the knowledge or consent of their own. In 1608 John Cameron became Primrose's colleague at Bordeaux, and they &#145;lived on the most cordial terms and governed the church with the greatest concord for ten years&#146;  (Wodrow, MS Gen 1207), after which Cameron left for a professorship at Saumur.<br>
<br>Throughout his ministry at Bordeaux, Primrose was an active theological controversialist, publishing a number of works, including <span class="italic">Le voeu de Jacob oppos&eacute; aux voeux de moines</span> (4 vols., 1610), which was later translated into English by John Bulteel as <span class="italic">Jacob's Vow, Opposed to the Vows of Monks and Friers</span> (1617); <span class="italic">La trompette de Sion</span> (1610); and <span class="italic">La d&eacute;fense de la religion reform&eacute;e</span> (1619).<br>
<br>In 1623 an act was passed forbidding ministers of other nations to officiate in France, and at the national synod which met at Charenton in September of that year the royal commissioner presented letters from the French king intimating that Primrose and Cameron were no longer to be employed, &#145;not so much because of their birth as foreigners as for reasons of state&#146;  (Quick, 2.101). Primrose was obliged to quit the country, and, according to an account of his own life which he wrote in 1626, his banishment was mainly due to the machinations of the Jesuits, to whom he had given special offence.<br>
<br>On his return to London in the autumn of 1623, Primrose was chosen one of the ministers of the French and Walloon refugee church, an appointment which he held for the rest of his life. On 18 January 1625 his degree was incorporated at the University of Oxford, and he received the degree of DD on the same day on the recommendation of James I. Charles I appointed him chaplain, probably some time after October 1626, and in July 1628 preferred him to a canonry of Windsor. During his career in England, Primrose continued to maintain his contacts with the Huguenot churches. He corresponded frequently with Andr&eacute; Rivet, professor of theology at Leiden, to whom he relayed news of their French and Scottish colleagues and of the education in the French church of London of Rivet's nephew, Pierre du Moulin the younger (whom Primrose considered talented but lazy).<br>
<br>Primrose's writings of this period equally evince a continuing concern for the Huguenots. The <span class="italic">Pan&eacute;gyrique &agrave; tr&egrave;s grand et tr&egrave;s puissant Prince Charles, prince de Galles</span> (1624) and the collection of sermons <span class="italic">Reconciliation de l'homme avec Dieu</span> (1624) were both published in French for a French audience. In <span class="italic">The Righteous Man's Evil, and the Lord's Deliverance</span> (1625), Primrose places the recent military campaign by the French crown against the Huguenots firmly in the long history of Christian martyrdom and persecution, and advocates continuing support from England for those brethren suffering abroad. His friend Bishop Joseph Hall of Exeter dedicated his response to Urban VIII's vituperative attack on the Huguenots, <span class="italic">An Answer to Pope Urban his Inurbanity</span> (1629), to Primrose, who in return wrote a grateful letter of commendation (printed as an appendix to the same work). Primrose's other major works include <span class="italic">The Christian Man's Tears and Christ's Comforts</span> (1625), <span class="italic">Three Sermons of the Table of the Lord</span> (1627), and an English translation of his son David's work, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Sabbath and the Lords-Day</span> (1636).<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife, Elizabeth, in July 1637, Primrose married twice more&#151;on 14 December 1637 to Jeanne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hersent, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/901/', "Abraham Aurelius")</script>, and (Jeanne having died on 8 June 1641) on 21 September 1641 to Louise de Lobel, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20853/', "Jacob Cool")</script>. At his death in early December 1642, &#145;att my house in Chiswell streete neare to Finsbury house&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/190, fols. 351<i>v</i>&#150;352<i>v</i>), Primrose was survived by his sons James, David, Stephen, and John and by his married daughter Louise Blakal.<br>
