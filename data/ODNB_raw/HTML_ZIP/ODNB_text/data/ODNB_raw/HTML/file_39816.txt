<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oakeshott,  Michael Joseph</span>  (1901&#150;1990), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 11 December 1901 at Chelsfield, Kent, the second of the three sons (there were no daughters) of Joseph Francis Oakeshott of Harpenden, Hertfordshire, a Fabian civil servant who had played a part in founding the London School of Economics (LSE), and his wife, Frances Maude Hellicar. Oakeshott was educated at St George's School, Harpenden, a progressive co-educational school, and left moving accounts of the excitements a boy of scholarly disposition might enjoy as he came into contact with his classical inheritance. He went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1920, and after a year in Germany in 1923&#150;4 following graduation (he was placed in the second division of the first class in both parts&#151;1922 and 1923&#151;of the history tripos), and a short period as a schoolmaster at Lytham St Anne's grammar school in Lancashire, became a history fellow of the college in 1925.<br>
<br>Oakeshott's early interests were in religion and historiography. Both led him on to philosophy and generated <span class="italic">Experience and its Modes</span> (1933), in which he distinguished the different forms of human activity. R. G. Collingwood admired particularly its treatment of history, but the reception of the book was cool. The 1000 copies printed took over thirty years to sell out. In 1936 Oakeshott collaborated with Guy Griffith on <span class="italic">A Guide to the Classics, or, How to Pick the Derby Winner</span>, an analysis of horse-racing, the second edition of which was called <span class="italic">How to Pick the Winner</span> (1947). In 1939 he published <span class="italic">The Social and Political Doctrines of Contemporary Europe</span>, an anthology of political writings with commentary.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Oakeshott enlisted as a gunner and rose to be a captain in Phantom, a special unit whose dangerous work it was to report on the effect of artillery fire from close to the front. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge and wrote his famous introduction (1946) to Hobbes's <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> (1651). He edited the <span class="italic">Cambridge Journal</span> from 1947 until its demise in 1954 and contributed actively to making it a centre of intellectual resistance to the ideas of social engineering, collectivism, and state planning dominant at that period. His love of freedom was so radical that his conservatism had anarchic tendencies. Most of the essays later reprinted in <span class="italic">Rationalism in Politics</span> (1962) first appeared in the journal. In 1949 he went to Nuffield College, Oxford, as an official fellow, and in 1951 he was appointed to the chair of political science at the LSE.<br>
<br>The contrast between the public profile and enthusiastic socialism of Harold Laski, his predecessor, and Oakeshott's sceptical conservatism made the LSE appointment a dramatic one, and his famous inaugural lecture, <span class="italic">Political Education</span> (1951), made an appropriate splash. During his years at the LSE he lived in a small flat in Covent Garden. He administered the government department at the school with unostentatious efficiency, sending a stream of elegant handwritten notes to his colleagues, and was a familiar figure in the common room. He avoided committees when he could, but none the less played his part, and his unmistakable prose in, for example, describing the duties of a tutor, was to pass unscathed through several revisions of the BSc (Econ.) degree.<br>
<br>In 1961 the University of London established the one-year master's degree, and although Oakeshott thought it an absurd idea, he set up an option within it on the history of political thought, which led to a distinguished seminar he ran with several colleagues. It drew scholars from all over the world, and he continued to attend until his late seventies. The work he did for this seminar, continually revised, appeared in <span class="italic">On History</span> (1983).<br>
<br>Oakeshott retired from the LSE in 1969 and eventually moved to Acton, near Langton Matravers in Dorset. Two cottages near a stone quarry had been knocked together, and he lined the walls with bookcases. Typically, he made something stylish out of the second-hand materials around him. He lived there until he died in 1990, though he often went to London to stay with his friends William and Shirley Letwin, or travelled to Hull or Durham, where favourite pupils were established in departments. He did venture to Harvard University, and to Colorado College in Colorado Springs, a favourite place which elicited &#145;A place of learning&#146;, later republished among other essays on education in <span class="italic">The Voice of Liberal Learning</span> (1989), edited by Timothy Fuller. More commonly, he travelled to France.<br>
<br>Oakeshott was slight of build and elegant in his dress without being ostentatious. Many of his clothes, like the furniture of his cottage in Dorset, were picked up second-hand. In everything he did he was stylish without being precious. His voice was light, but carried remarkably well. No one could better him at making some sense out of the most opaque academic paper; he was a matchless discussant. The real passion of his life, however, was to understand the uniquely human. Philosophy he took to be the search for the postulates of human activities. As exclusively concerned to understand rather than control the world, it was a pure, almost morbid, preoccupation. In <span class="italic">Experience and its Modes</span>, the most insidious of errors was found to be irrelevance&#151;applying to one mode of activity the criteria appropriate to another. In his masterpiece <span class="italic">On Human Conduct</span> (1975), on which he had been working for years at the LSE but which came out after he had retired, the idea that experience is composed of a few discrete modes (practice, history, science, poetry) was loosened and replaced by &#145;conditional platforms of understanding&#146;, from which the enquirer casts his net to see what may be caught by any particular set of ideas.<br>
<br>Oakeshott argued that a modern state is best understood in terms of a distinction between two sorts of human association, which he called &#145;civil&#146; and &#145;enterprise&#146;. Characteristically, the first of the three essays in the book delineates what it is to enquire philosophically about human conduct, the second postulates the purely ideal forms of civil and enterprise association, and only in the third, long, historical essay does Oakeshott engage with the historical literature on the modern state, of which he had undoubtedly the most profound understanding of anyone in his generation. He has often been described as a &#145;conservative philosopher&#146;, but he regarded this expression as a solecism, for philosophers should not be partisans. Nevertheless he did eloquently characterize a conservative disposition: it corresponded to his own character.<br>
<br>Oakeshott was married three times. In 1927 he married Joyce Margaret, daughter of Guy Fricker, electrical engineer, of Harpenden; they had one son, Simon. The marriage was dissolved in 1938 and in the same year he married Katherine Alice Burton (<i>d</i>. 1964), daughter of Charles Frederick Burton, of Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. The couple had no children and their marriage was dissolved in 1951. In 1965 he married Christel Schneider, who had been brought up in Nuremberg, the daughter of Johann Schneider, bookkeeper and later dairy worker. They had no children.<br>
<br>Oakeshott refused public honours and honorary doctorates from several universities, but he did accept honorary doctorates from Colorado, Durham, and Hull. In 1966 he became a fellow of the British Academy. He died at his home, Victoria Cottage, in Acton, Dorset, on 18 December 1990.<br>
