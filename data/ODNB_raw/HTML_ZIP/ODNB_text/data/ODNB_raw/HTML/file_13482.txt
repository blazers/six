<span class="headword">Holbroke <span class="st"> [Holbrook]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1437), <span class="occ">mathematician and astronomer</span>, was a native of Suffolk. He is first recorded in August 1393, when he was admitted to a fellowship at Peterhouse, Cambridge; he became master about June 1421 and held that position for the rest of his life. He was ordained priest in 1413 and was styled DTh by 1418; no doubt he had been awarded the degree of MA several years before. Holbroke endowed the Barnard Castle loan chest at Peterhouse with 10 marks in 1426 and 20 marks in 1436. Borrowers from the chest were to pray for the souls of Holbroke and their other benefactors. He served as proctor of Cambridge University in 1398&#150;9 and as chancellor of the university in November 1429 and in 1430. During his chancellorship a memorable dispute, the &#145;Barnwell Process&#146;, arose with the bishop of Ely concerning ecclesiastical jurisdiction over university scholars. Pope Martin V (<i>r</i>. 1417&#150;31) delegated the adjudication to the prior of Barnwell, who ruled in favour of the university's autonomy from diocesan control. Holbroke was a chaplain to Henry V and Henry VI. According to the astrological treatise, <span class="italic">Cum rerum motu</span> (a work of uncertain authorship, preserved only in CUL, MS Ee.3.61, fols. 159&#150;75), Henry V, detained by the siege of Meaux, dispatched Holbroke to Windsor to be present at the birth of the king's son. Holbroke is said to have been the first man to set eyes on the infant prince, the future Henry VI. Apparently he twice calculated Henry VI's natal horoscope: <span class="italic">Cum rerum motu</span> cites the royal nativity &#145;secundum Mag.J.Holbroke&#146;. However, an amended version appears in a manuscript owned by Holbroke  (BL, Egerton MS 889, fol. 5<i>r</i>; an additional copy in Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 369, fol. 182<i>v</i>). There is no record of his interpretation of these bare natal horoscopes, that is, of the astrological portents for Henry VI's reign.<br>
<br>Holbroke's reputation as a mathematician derived from his compilation of astronomical tables for the Cambridge meridian. His <span class="italic">Opus primum</span> is a set of tables which allow the calculation of the true and mean positions of the sun, moon, and planets. Striving for greater accuracy, Holbroke extended the calculation of planetary locations to ten sexagesimal places in his <span class="italic">Opus secundum</span>. The tremendous, if vain, effort of drafting the <span class="italic">Opus secundum</span> impressed users of the tables well into the next century. One sixteenth-century scholar remarked: &#145;This man was the mathematical glory of Cambridge for ther was nower any one good in this knowledge before Holbrooke who was <i>satis profundus</i>&#146;  (Gloucester, Cathedral Library, MS 21, fol. 163). Holbroke died in Cambridge in or before July 1437 and was buried in the chancel of St Mary-the-Less, Cambridge, where a monumental brass remains (although it has been severely damaged). He presented three books to Peterhouse in 1426: a copy of Haly Abenragel's <span class="italic">De judiciis stellarum</span>  (now Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 151), John Ashenden's <span class="italic">Summa judicialis de accidentibus mundi</span>  (London, Royal College of Physicians, MS 390), and Holbroke's astronomical tables, written partly in his own hand  (BL, Egerton MS 889, also known as the <span class="roman">Codex Holbrookensis</span>). Another manuscript owned by Holbroke entered the Peterhouse Library at a later date  (Cambridge, Peterhouse, MS 267). To the university he gave a copy of Gregory's <span class="italic">Super Ezechielem</span>, and two knives with ivory handles. Holbroke's will also provided for the construction of the lower choir stalls for the chapel of Peterhouse.<br>
