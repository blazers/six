<span class="headword">Butts <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Rodker, Aitken]</span>,  Mary Franeis</span>  (1890&#150;1937), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 13 December 1890 at The Salterns, Parkstone, south Dorset, the elder of the two children of Frederick John Butts (1833&#150;1905), captain and gentleman, and his second wife, Mary Jane (1863&#150;1944), daughter of the Revd James Briggs of Parkstone, Dorset, and his wife, Sarah.<br>
<br>Mary Butts spent her first fifteen years at Salterns. She described her childhood in her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Crystal Cabinet</span> (1937), as a &#145;perfectness&#146;. Her great-grandfather Thomas Butts had been William Blake's patron, and she grew up among the treasures of Salterns which included a number of Blake's paintings and possessions. The paintings were later sold and are now in the Tate collection but Mary Butts wrote that she inherited &#145;the kind of seeing that there was in William Blake&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Crystal Cabinet</span>, 34). The countryside around Salterns together with the classical stories and myths her beloved father recounted and acted out with her haunted her imagination and informed her writing, which has a visionary quality akin to Blake's. &#145;I can write, I want to, should never want to <i>do</i> anything else&#146;, she wrote in a later diary entry in 1927, but she had discovered her vocation as a child.<br>
<br>Mary Butts was educated locally at The Haven and Sandecotes schools until her father's death. Her mother married Frederick Colville-Hyde and Mary Butts chose to become a boarder at St Leonard's School for Girls in St Andrews. She took the entrance exams for Cambridge but was unsuccessful and registered as a &#145;general student&#146; at Westfield College, London (1909&#150;12), but left before completing her degree. The following autumn she entered the London School of Economics and graduated in 1914 with a social science certificate, the equivalent of the present-day diploma in social work. She then worked on the Children's Care Committee in the East End of London, before becoming actively involved in the pacifist movement during the First World War, working on the first National Council for Civil Liberties. By this time she had become an atheist and socialist. In her late teens to mid-twenties Mary Butts seems to have had mainly lesbian relationships. This changed, however, when she met the poet and publisher John Rodker (1894&#150;1955). They were married at the Hampstead register office on 10 May 1918 and worked together on Rodker's first publishing house, the Ovid Press (1920). Their only child, Camilla Elizabeth, was born in November 1920, by which time the marriage had broken down, and in early 1921 Mary Butts left for the continent with her lover, the author Cecil Maitland. She divorced Rodker in 1926.<br>
<br>During the first half of the 1920s Mary Butts was based in London at 43 Belsize Park Gardens and her work began to be published in many of the little magazines of the period. <span class="italic">Speed the Plough and other Stories</span> (1923) was followed by her first novel, <span class="italic">Ashe of Rings</span> (1925), set in and written during the war. By 1925 her relationship with Maitland had ended and she left for Paris and the French riviera where she stayed until the end of the decade. During the 1920s she knew many of her now more famous modernist contemporaries and is remembered in numerous memoirs for her exuberant personality, her passion for her work (in which she developed an original prose style), and her striking red hair. Jean Cocteau illustrated her epistolary prose sequence, <span class="italic">Imaginary Letters</span> (1928), which was published a few months after her second novel, <span class="italic">Armed with Madness</span>, a modernist treatment of the grail myth.<br>
<br>In 1930 Mary Butts collapsed from poverty, alcoholism, and drug addiction and returned permanently to England. On 29 October 1930 in London she married the artist Gabriel William Aitken, otherwise Atkin (1897&#150;1937). In 1932 they moved to Sennen Cove, west Cornwall, to a small cliffside bungalow, which she renamed Tebel Vos (House of Magic). The marriage lasted four years. Aitken moved away in late 1934 in which year Mary Butts converted to Anglo-Catholicism.<br>
<br>The 1930s saw a prodigious output. In addition to becoming a regular reviewer, Mary Butts published her third novel, <span class="italic">Death of Felicity Taverner</span> (1932); two historical narratives (<span class="italic">The Macedonian</span>, 1933, and <span class="italic">Scenes from the Life of Cleopatra</span>, 1935) for which she was highly respected among historians; two further volumes of short stories (<span class="italic">Several Occasions</span>, 1932, and <span class="italic">Last Stories</span>, 1938); her autobiography; and numerous poems and articles. The last category includes an appreciation of Aldous Huxley (1931), one of the first critical essays on the supernatural writer M. R. James (1934), a history of supernatural fiction (1933), and two pamphlets which address the psychological and ecological consequences of industrialization, urbanization, and loss of religious faith (<span class="italic">Warning to Hikers</span>, 1932, and <span class="italic">Traps for Unbelievers</span>, 1932).<br>
<br>Mary Butts remained in Sennen Cove until her sudden death from general peritonitis at Penzance General Hospital on 5 March 1937. She was buried in Sennen church cemetery. Out of print for several decades, Butts's work has slowly been republished since the late 1980s. Always highly regarded by writers, it is only since the latter part of the twentieth century that her contribution to modern literature has begun to be properly recognized.<br>
