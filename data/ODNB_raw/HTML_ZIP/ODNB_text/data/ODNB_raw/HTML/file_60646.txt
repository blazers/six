<span class="headword">Cook,  Robert William Arthur <span class="st"> [Robin; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>pseud. </em>Derek Raymond]</span>  (1931&#150;1994), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 12 June 1931 at 8 Montague Place, London, the elder of two sons of Arthur Cook (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1973), a company director, and Pamela Florence Pollock, of American-Jewish extraction (she was previously married to an Anglo-German with whom she had three sons). Cook's paternal great-grandfather took part in the charge of the light brigade, of which he was a survivor. Cook had an unhappy childhood, hating his mother and despising his father. His uncle John, seemingly the only adult who showed him any affection, was killed in the engine room of a torpedoed ship in April 1941 when Cook was nine.<br>
<br>Cook attended St Peter's Court before going to Eton College in 1944. He disliked Eton, though he later conceded it was &#145;an excellent preparation for vice of any kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), and at sixteen he refused to stay any longer. He was subsequently sent to Turret Court, an establishment for difficult public-school boys. In 1949&#150;51 he did two years' national service with the 7th Royal Tank regiment, and became a lance-corporal. On 15 September 1959 he married Dora Sherwood. He thereafter spent time in Italy, Spain, and America, but in 1960 was back in London and involved with organized crime. His Etonian manner was a useful asset to the Charles da Silva gang, who practised &#145;long-firming&#146;, the running of a bogus, fraudulent company to obtain goods on credit before disappearing. They also sold non-existent property.<br>
<br>Throughout the early sixties Cook lived between a fast Chelsea set and the underworld, a crossover which gave rise to his first novel, <span class="italic">The Crust on its Uppers</span> (1962). Eric Partridge is said to have recognized this as the greatest source of slang for a quarter of a century  (Meades, 440). Its terminology includes Cook's division of the world into &#145;morries&#146; (sharp operators, people in the know, one's friends) and &#145;slag&#146; (the rest). Cook's examination of upper-middle-class decay proceeded further with subsequent novels such as <span class="italic">The Legacy of the Stiff Upper Lip</span> (1965). He lived hard in the early sixties, and was remembered by one witness as the man who &#145;behaved badly before anyone else did&#146; (quotedibid., 441). Divorced from Dora Sherwood, Cook married Eugene Eva Marie Grossman on 12 October 1963.<br>
<br>Cook was in rural Italy during the late 1960s and spent a couple of years working as a London minicab driver at the start of the 1970s. By 1971 his marriage to his second wife was over, and he became involved with Sandra Valerie Haggerty. The breakup of this relationship in 1973 precipitated a new stage of his life. He moved to France and settled in Le Puech, where he spent the next eighteen years. Meanwhile the success of the American mass-market novelist Robin Cook meant that Cook needed a pseudonym: he adopted the name Derek Raymond, taken from two men he particularly respected, Derek Head and John Raymond, the latter the book reviewer and critic.<br>
<br>In 1983 Cook published under his pseudonym <span class="italic">He Died with his Eyes Open</span>, the first of his infamous &#145;Factory&#146; novels (&#145;factory&#146; being slang for a police station). Narrated by an unnamed policeman with a penchant for soliloquy, the Derek Raymond books were far darker, more Gothic explorations of evil and violence than the Robin Cook titles. <span class="italic">I was Dora Suarez</span> (1990), about a murdered prostitute, was widely reported to have caused a publishing editor to be physically sick while reading it.<br>
<br>The sensibility of the <span class="roman">Factory</span> series is essentially poetic in its saturated, Jacobean treatment of psychic dereliction. The <span class="roman">Factory</span> novels have at least as much to do with Cook's personal demons as with life on the street, and they feature a synthetic argot, the language of an underworld which has never quite existed. They attracted comparisons with Donne and Beckett, and were variously described as &#145;the best British crime novels of the 1980s&#146; and &#145;the naffest pieces of crime fiction ever written&#146; (quoted in <span class="italic">The Times</span>). Nevertheless, their sheer extremity and excess gave them a certain cachet.<br>
<br>In 1992 Cook published his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Hidden Files</span>. This was reticent about his criminal career but dwelt on his childhood, on &#145;metaphysics&#146;, and on the rationale of the &#145;black novel&#146;: an arresting phrase in English, though relatively familiar in French as <i>roman noir</i>. Cook was an atheist, but he described his probes into abjection and despair with almost religious intensity. &#145;I am often terrified by the work I do on the lost,&#146; he writes in <span class="italic">The Hidden Files</span>: &#145;I do not mean the dead, so much as those whose misery, as formless as it is profound, is so great that they wish they were dead&#146;  (Raymond, <span class="italic">The Hidden Files</span>, 67). Writing of why the detective in <span class="italic">Suarez</span> picks up a murdered woman's head and kisses it, he suggested, &#145;What is remarkable about <span class="italic">I was Dora Suarez</span> has nothing to do with literature at all; what is remarkable about it is that in its own way &hellip; it struggles after the same message as Christ&#146;  (ibid., 98).<br>
<br>Cook was well respected in France, where his work was filmed; <span class="italic">He Died with his Eyes Open</span> was filmed as <span class="italic">On ne meurt que deux fois</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">The Devil's Home on Leave</span> as <span class="italic">Les mois d'avril sont meurtriers</span> (1987). He became a cult celebrity during the early nineties and moved back to London, where he lived in a small flat in West Hampstead. Towards the end of his life he read with a literary circus of writers including Iain Sinclair, Christopher Petit, and Kathy Acker. He made a record with a band called Gallon Drunk, and featured with Iain Sinclair and others in Christopher Petit's 1992 Channel 4 film <span class="italic">The Cardinal and the Corpse</span>. A tall, thin, cadaverous man with a patrician accent and a trademark beret, Cook became a Soho character. He was a heavy drinker with a taste for premium-strength lagers, and died from liver failure at his home, 106A Bathurst Gardens, Kensal Rise, London, on 30 July 1994. He was cremated at the north London crematorium, near Harlesden.<br>
