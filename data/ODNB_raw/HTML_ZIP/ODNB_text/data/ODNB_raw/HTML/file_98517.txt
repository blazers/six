<span class="headword">Chalmers,  George</span>  (1857&#150;1928), <span class="occ">mining engineer in Brazil</span>, was born at Flushing, Cornwall, on 17 January 1857, the youngest son of Captain John Chalmers (1810&#150;1870), an army officer who had served in Jamaica before retiring to Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goater (1820&#150;1885). He was educated at Holy Trinity church school, Springfield, Essex, and then studied engineering at King's College, London, from 1875 to 1878. He worked for Harvey &amp; Co. in Cornwall, principally in mining operations, from 1879 to 1882, when he joined the Brentford Gas Company. On 30 September 1883 he married Augusta Maria (1860&#150;1885), the daughter of Richard Frederick Tyacke, vicar of Uny Lelant, Cornwall.<br>
<br>In 1884 Chalmers became superintendent of the Morro Velho gold mine owned by the St John d'el Rey Mining Co. Ltd in Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Located some 435 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, the Morro Velho (&#145;old hill&#146;) mine had probably been worked since the early eighteenth century. It had been purchased by British investors in London in 1834, and over the next fifty years yielded prodigious quantities of gold and employed what may have been the largest slave force in Brazil at the time (1500 slaves), enabling the St John d'el Rey company to pay out annual dividends of around &pound;25,000 to stockholders from the 1830s to the 1880s. In November 1886, not long after Chalmers's arrival, the mine collapsed killing dozens of miners (British and Brazilian). He drew up comprehensive plans to dig a new mine alongside the old and build a completely new and modern refining facility. He then persuaded the management to raise the capital to carry out his plans and reopen the mine. Over the next decade he led the rebuilding of the mine and by 1901 the new operation was again paying regular dividends averaging around 7 per cent annually to stockholders. By the 1930s the mine reached a depth of 2453 metres, making it the deepest mine in the world until the 1950s.<br>
<br>Under Chalmers St John d'el Rey became the largest foreign enterprise in early twentieth-century Brazil. In addition to gold mining operations he bought up iron deposits in Minas Gerais and experimented with the production of steel. Beginning in the 1890s he built a series of hydroelectric plants to power mining operations and to provide lighting in Nova Lima. He also experimented with the production of aluminium, alcohol-powered vehicles, and the planting of tracts of eucalyptus trees to supply wood and charcoal for the mine. By the late 1920s the company's revenues (&pound;500,000) were equal to about one-fifth of the total revenues of the state government. The St John company was easily the single largest taxpayer in Minas Gerais, where Chalmers formed friendships with many of the most powerful politicians and businessmen. With more than 5000 workers among the 15,000 inhabitants of Nova Lima, the company was also the state's largest employer. Nearly all the company management was British, as were the mining captains and department heads. The British community in Nova Lima numbered several hundreds, and had its own Anglican church, cemetery, priest, school, hospital, club, and football team.<br>
<br>In 1924 Chalmers stepped down as superintendent and was given the title of general manager of the mine. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. On the death of his mother in 1885 he and his two elder brothers, John and William, shared an inheritance of nearly &pound;40,000 that together with other family inheritances made him an independently wealthy man. An avid hunter and fisherman, he bought a private estate (Jaguara) to which he frequently retreated by the 1920s. Following the death of his first wife from tuberculosis soon after they arrived in Brazil, he married her elder sister, Eleanor Josephine Tyacke (1857&#150;1900), despite a Church of England prohibition against marriage to a deceased wife's sister; the ceremony was conducted by a Methodist pastor in Rio de Janeiro in 1886 over the objections of her father. He had two sons with his second wife, the elder of whom, Alexander George North Chalmers (1887&#150;1960), succeeded him as superintendent of the Morro Velho mine. Shortly after returning to England for medical treatment he died of heart failure on 4 February 1928 in a London nursing home. He was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
