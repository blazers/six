<span class="headword">Walpole,  Ralph  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1302), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich and of Ely</span>, was a Norfolk man, probably the son of Sir John of Walpole of Houghton and his wife, Lucy. He is first recorded in February 1272 when, with the degree of MA, he was admitted by Richard of Gravesend, bishop of Lincoln, to the living of Somersham, Huntingdonshire, at the presentation of Hugh of Balsham, bishop of Ely. No later than 12 July in the same year he became archdeacon of Ely, a preferment of unusual scope and responsibility. He was also a theologian, recorded as determining in a disputation in the Cambridge theology faculty in the early 1280s. By March 1287 he was doctor of theology, while in 1290 he gave his house in Cambridge to Balsham's new foundation of Peterhouse. With his intellectual interests and wide administrative experience, it is not surprising that, following the death of William Middleton, bishop of Norwich, on 1 September 1288, the electing committee of seven monks should on 11 November following have unanimously chosen Walpole to succeed him. Their decision, according to the chronicler Bartholomew Cotton, deeply offended local opinion in the diocese, but Walpole, who had travelled as far as Bonnegarde in the south of Gascony to obtain Edward I's consent to his election, was confirmed by Archbishop John Pecham on 1 February 1289. Before Pecham acted, he persuaded Walpole to renounce the right to first fruits&#151;the first year's revenues from a living&#151;which the bishops of Norwich had enjoyed since the time of Pandulf (<i>d</i>. 1226). The temporalities were restored on 7 February, and Walpole was consecrated by Pecham on 20 March.<br>
<br>As bishop of Norwich, Walpole was much engaged in local affairs, not least in what became a lengthy dispute with the townspeople of Bishop's Lynn over episcopal lordship, a dispute only settled by Walpole's successor, Bishop John Salmon, in 1309. In 1289 he conducted a visitation of his diocese. Although he did not entirely observe his undertaking to abandon his claim to first fruits (which continued to augment the income of his successors), he made only modest demands on new incumbents. His relations with his own cathedral priory seem to have been good; Walpole secured a licence from the crown enabling him to transfer three messuages in Norwich from himself to the priory, and resolved disputes between the monks and the rector of Great Cressingham and the archdeacon of Suffolk. More visibly, perhaps, he took the lead in the reconstruction of the cloister (and possibly also the chapter house), made necessary by damage inflicted in riots in 1272. Although he attended a provincial council in 1290, Walpole played little part in national affairs, secular or ecclesiastical, before 1296&#150;7, when he gave steady support to Archbishop Robert Winchelsey in the latter's resistance to Edward I's increasingly heavy taxation of the English church. The papal decree <span class="italic">Clericis laicos</span> in February 1296 forbade the clergy to contribute to lay taxation without papal consent; in January 1297 Walpole was one of the ecclesiastical envoys who informed the king of the English church's resolve to obey the bull, and he is said to have been one of the bishops who held out longest against royal demands. Although Walpole was one of the lay and secular magnates who, as the king endeavoured to resolve the crisis, performed homage to Prince Edward on 14 July 1297, he was still apparently regarded as one of the king's opponents in September, appearing among a group of the latter summoned to parliament.<br>
<br>His position on the issue of clerical taxation did not, however, prevent Walpole's elevation to another see. Following the death of William of Louth, bishop of Ely, on 25 March 1298, the monks of the cathedral priory were divided in their preferences between their own prior, John Salmon, and the treasurer of the exchequer, John Langton, whose candidature was favoured by the king. The monks first approached Archbishop Winchelsey, and then appealed to the pope. Both candidates appeared before Boniface VIII (<i>r</i>. 1294&#150;1303), and resigned their rights into the pope's hands. Boniface invited the monks to elect again, as a favour to their church licensing them to choose one of the abbots of an exempt Benedictine house; but their proctors could not agree, whereupon Boniface resolved the dispute on 5 June 1299 by translating Walpole to Ely, and providing Salmon to Norwich. Edward I acquiesced, the temporalities of Ely being restored on 10 October. The expenses of Walpole's proctor at Rome amounted to at least &pound;1200.<br>
<br>Walpole was bishop of Ely for less than three years. In 1300, following a visitation, he issued ordinances for the cathedral priory. The thirty-nine statutes contain little out of the ordinary, dealing with such issues as the need to maintain the full complement of seventy monks, restrictions on pocket money and on dealings with women, and the proper application of the convent's revenues. But they may also reflect the bishop's academic training, since they are essentially a compilation from earlier legislation, mostly by former archbishops of Canterbury and bishops of Ely. Ralph of Walpole died on 20 March 1302, and was buried before the high altar of Ely Cathedral on 1 April following.<br>
