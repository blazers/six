<span class="headword">Finnerty,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1766&#150;1822), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Loughrea, co. Galway, the son of a tradesman. Trained as a printer in Dublin, in the late 1790s Finnerty became involved with the United Irishmen. The creation of a radical press was a central platform of their policies. In September 1797 Arthur O'Connor had founded <span class="italic">The Press</span>, the newspaper of the Dublin United Irishmen which was run with help from Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Thomas Emmet, and William Drennan. <span class="italic">The Press</span> provided support to the movement's republicanism by printing the publications of the London Corresponding Society and the activities of United Irishmen in England. However, <span class="italic">The Press</span> never had the success of the other United Irishmen paper, the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, probably because its focus was narrower and it tended to be moralistic.<br>
<br>Finnerty was registered in Dublin as nominal printer and publisher of <span class="italic">The Press</span> in September 1797. On 31 October he was arrested for printing a seditious libel and was imprisoned in Dublin's Newgate. At his trial the court was told that he had published a letter signed Marcus which criticized the conviction and execution of William Orr, a presbyterian farmer, for administering the United Irish oath to a private in the Fifeshire fencibles. Finnerty refused to divulge the letter-writer's real name. His counsel, who spoke eloquently in his defence, was John Philpot Curran, who had defended William Drennan in 1794. On 23 December Finnerty was found guilty and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, fined &pound;20, and bound to give security for future good behaviour for the next seven years. He was also made to stand in a pillory for an hour outside the sessions house in Dublin, where he was supported by a large crowd of sympathizers. After having served the whole of his sentence he went to London, where he wrote for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> as a parliamentary reporter for over twenty years. The <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was a whig paper, owned and edited by James Perry, who had pioneered the publication of extended parliamentary reporting and whose contributors included William Hazlitt, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and David Ricardo.<br>
<br>In London Finnerty became part of the group of Irishmen exiled to England after the rebellion of 1798 who worked to keep alive the links with United Irishmen in France and Ireland. In 1802 Finnerty and others involved in preparations for a rising in London fled to Ireland in the wake of the arrest of Colonel Despard. By 1805, however, Finnerty had returned to London and was one of many Irishmen in England who supported constitutional agitation under the leadership of Sir Francis Burdett. At the invitation of Sir Home Popham, in 1809 he went as special correspondent on the ill-starred Walcheren expedition. (For his assignment during this action it is possible that he was the first accredited war correspondent, preceding William Howard Russell by fifty years.) His reports to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> describing the incompetent handling of the expedition led to his arrest, and he was transported back to England. In a letter to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> printed on his return Finnerty described the expedition and his rejection of the proposition by Lord Chatham and Sir Richard Strachan (leader of the expedition) that they should censor his reports before publication. He accused Lord Castlereagh of attempting to silence him. He also accused Castlereagh of harsh treatment of the Irish people. In February 1811 Finnerty was put on trial for libelling Castlereagh, sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment in Lincoln gaol, and required to provide substantial securities for good behaviour for five years. In March 1811 Percy Bysshe Shelley, soon to be expelled from Oxford University, published his poem <span class="italic">Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things</span>; the poem, which was discovered in 2006 and made public by the Bodleian Library in 2015, included a declaration that it was written for &#145;ASSISTING TO MAINTAIN IN PRISON, MR. PETER FINNERTY, IMPRISONED FOR A LIBEL&#146;. In June 1811 Finnerty petitioned the House of Commons about his treatment in prison, and in the debate Sir Francis Burdett, Sir Samuel Romilly, and Brougham spoke strongly in his support. Finnerty's courage in his own defence attracted popular sympathy, and when he was released he was given &pound;2000 which had been raised by public subscription. In 1819 he narrowly avoided arrest once again for taking notes of a debate while in the gallery of the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Despite his radical tendencies, Finnerty was felt to be an irritant in the side of not only the authorities but also his fellow journalists, who were not sorry to see his removal from the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Finnerty died on 11 May 1822 at Westminster.<br>
