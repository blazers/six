<span class="headword">Fraser,  Gordon</span>  (1911&#150;1981), <span class="occ">greetings card publisher</span>, was born (lame in one leg) on 26 February 1911 at Ben Wyvis, North Park Grove, Roundhay, Leeds, the son of Kenneth Fraser, managing director of the Yorkshire Copper Works, and his wife, Alice Gertrude Fraser, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodall. His father was of Scottish descent.<br>
<br>Fraser was educated at Oundle School and St John's College, Cambridge, with some &#145;topping up&#146; at Munich University, the London School of Economics, and Pitman's College. In 1930, while still an undergraduate, he published six pamphlets at Cambridge under his own Minority Press imprint, including two written by F. R. Leavis, and went on to publish further works by Leavis and others, under the same imprint, between 1931 and 1933. In 1935 he set up as a bookseller in Portugal Place, Cambridge. On 9 April the following year, four days before Easter, he married a merchant's daughter, Nancy Katharine Jones, at the Presbyterian church, Downing Street, Cambridge. The couple had two children: a daughter, Margaret Alice Fraser (later Moss) (<i>b</i>. 1938), and a son, Ian Gordon Fraser (<i>b</i>. 1948).<br>
<br>Fraser combined his bookshop with a small gallery of fine art prints, and in 1938 he introduced his first Christmas greetings cards, blending good design with high-quality printing and a price that would not deter customers.<br>
<br>The Second World War caused Fraser's career to take a new turn. On its outbreak, he became a full-time member of the Cambridgeshire civil defence, and a year later joined the army and trained at Sandhurst. This prepared him for a wartime role as an officer in the intelligence corps, using his knowledge of French and German. His assignments took him first to Palestine, then to the western desert. Stationed in Cairo and later the Adriatic, he planned missions to support the partisans in Yugoslavia, and became a link between allied forces and such high-ranking partisan leaders as Velebit and even Tito himself.<br>
<br>After the war Fraser was appointed director of UNESCO's radio division in Paris, and it was not until 1954 that he was able to return and resume full control of his business. It was then that he broadened his range of greetings cards. His first birthday cards appeared in 1955 and he subsequently added Easter, Valentine, mother's day, father's day, and other cards appropriate for a wide range of occasions. A further development was fine art cards, with reproductions of old masters, themselves followed by postcards, notepaper, stationery, and gift wrapping.<br>
<br>Throughout this period and up to his death Fraser personally selected his gallery designs, opening a London office as a base to interview artists and overseas buyers. The Gordon Fraser Gallery's administration and warehousing moved to Bedford, where it remained thereafter, with Ian Fraser succeeding his father as art editor. In 1978 the company acquired the Roundwood Press in Warwickshire to meet its printing requirements. Latterly he resumed book publishing, producing in 1970 a selection of classics with the Fraser Press imprint, followed by <span class="italic">Vorticism</span> (1976) and the <span class="italic">Treasures of the Bodleian Library</span> (1976) under the Gordon Fraser imprint.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1981 Fraser was killed in a car accident while driving on the M6 south of Preston, Lancashire. His Jaguar sports car exploded in flames, and he died instantly. The cause of the accident was never established, and a subsequent coroner's inquest recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Fraser undoubtedly revolutionized greetings card design and quality, and he maintained a house style that was widely imitated. By the time of his death his cards were selling at a rate of over 100 million a year in eighty-five countries, with associated companies in France, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and the United States. The Gordon Fraser Gallery's annual turnover at this time was running equally impressively, around &pound;10 million. Fraser was a colourful personality who made his mark wherever he went. Practically his sole methods of relaxation were books&#151;he was a discriminating reader and a devoted follower of F. R. Leavis&#151;and an annual skiing holiday at Davos, Switzerland.<br>
