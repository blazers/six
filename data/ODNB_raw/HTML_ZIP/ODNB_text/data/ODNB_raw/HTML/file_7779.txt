<span class="headword">Dolben, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1694), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 27 September 1627 at Stanwick, Northamptonshire, the second son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7778/', "Revd William Dolben (1588?&#150;1631)")</script>, rector of Stanwick, and Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh Williams of Cochwillan, Caernarvonshire, and niece of Archbishop Williams. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7775/', "John Dolben (1625&#150;1686)")</script>, archbishop of York, was his brother. William Dolben was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1647&#150;8 and was called to the bar in 1655. He received the degree of MA at Oxford in 1665 on the occasion of the incorporation <i>ad eundem</i> of the earl of Manchester, for whom he acted as secretary. In 1672 he was made a bencher of his inn. He was made recorder of London in 1676 and was knighted on 3 February 1677. Later in that year Dolben was made a king's counsel (2 May) and a king's serjeant (24 October), and a serjeant-at-law. Archbishop Sheldon made him steward of the see of Canterbury. North wrote of him that he was &#145;bred under a clerk of assize, and executed the office of the crown side, which gave him the habit of a loud voice, though he was but of a small person&#146;  (North, 3.110). No doubt this quality helped him when appointed a judge of king's bench on 23 October 1678. North thought him &#145;an arrant old snarler&#146;  (ibid.) on the bench. On 4 April 1678 he had opened the case for the crown on the trial of the earl of Pembroke for the murder of Nathaniel Cony. As a judge Dolben tried many of those implicated in the Popish Plot, including Edward Coleman (November 1678), those accused of the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey (February 1679), the queen's physician Sir George Wakeman (July 1679), Sir Thomas Gascoigne and Oliver Plunket, as well as one of their accusers, Edward Fitzharris (April 1681).<br>
<br>However, Dolben did not favour the surrender of corporate charters, an integral part of Charles II's strategy for taming the whigs, North reporting that he declined to give any opinion. So at the beginning of 1683 it was reported that &#145;Judge Dolben sits very slippery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 156), and on 18 April he received his <i>quietus</i>. According to Luttrell &#145;many think the occasion of his removal is because he is taken to be a person not well affected to the <i>quo warranto</i> against the city of London&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.225). Back in practice Dolben was one of the prosecutors of Algernon Sidney in November 1683. In December 1688 Dolben was suggested by the earl of Macclesfield as a possible source of legal advice for the peers meeting to solve the problem of calling a free parliament, but he was not summoned to attend. Dolben was reinstated as a judge in king's bench on 18 March 1689. In April he gave the charge to the Middlesex grand juries, inveighing &#145;mightily against the corruption of juries the last seven years, and gave in charge the laws against papists&#146;  (ibid., 1.527). In June he appeared before the Lords to provide reasons why he had been dismissed, and was soon called on to deliver his opinion on the surrender of the charters, whereon he stated that there were not enough precedents to support surrender. In June 1691 he gave another characteristic charge to the grand juries of Middlesex, directing them to inquire into malcontents who disturbed the peace of the kingdom through spreading seditious news.<br>
<br>Dolben died &#145;suddenly of an apopletic [<i>sic</i>] fit&#146;  (Luttrell, 3.259) on 25 January 1694, and was buried four days later in the Temple Church, his funeral being attended by the lord keeper and the judges. He was unmarried. In his will he memorably expressed his concern that any legacy bequeathed to his dissolute nephew John Dolben (1662&#150;1710) would be &#145;thrown away at the gaming table&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/418/6). Having already bequeathed &pound;1000 to John, Dolben therefore instructed his executor, John's brother Gilbert, to pay the remaining part of his nephew's legacy, a sum of &pound;4000, directly to John's children.<br>
