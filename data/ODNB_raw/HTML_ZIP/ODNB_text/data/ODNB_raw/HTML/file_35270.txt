<span class="headword">Nuttall,  Enos</span>  (1842&#150;1916), <span class="occ">archbishop of the West Indies</span>, was born at Clitheroe on 26 January 1842, the eldest son of James Nuttall, farmer and builder, of Coates, St Mary-le-Gill, Yorkshire, and his first wife, Alice, daughter of William and Martha Armistead of Aynhams, in the same parish. His education was such as his mother and the parish school could give him, but he developed powers of self-tuition, and being placed by his father in charge of a farm, gave his leisure to learning. James Nuttall was a Wesleyan, and Enos became at seventeen a local preacher of some power. Anxious for mission work abroad, he applied to the Revd George Osborn, secretary of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, was accepted, and, after a period of training under the Revd Andrew Kessen, was posted by the society to Jamaica, for which he sailed on 2 December 1862, in his twenty-first year, to work as a layman.<br>
<br>While his brother Ezra (1850&#150;1915) won distinction in South Africa as a Methodist minister, Enos offered himself in Jamaica for the ministry of the Church of England. He was ordained deacon on 18 February 1866 in the cathedral at Spanish Town, and priest on 8 April in the parish church, Kingston, where fifty years later (23 February 1916) his last sermon was addressed to a departing war contingent. He was appointed &#145;island curate&#146; of St George's, Kingston, with a stipend derived from the government, and technically he retained the post until his death. In December 1869 notice was given that state endowment (saving some life interests) would cease at the end of that year, and Nuttall, young as he was, took a leading part in the reorganization of the disestablished Church of England in Jamaica, helping to draft its canons and to settle its financial system, and engaging in public controversy with the governor, Sir John Peter Grant. He was made secretary of synod in 1870 and of the diocesan board of finance in 1874. Archbishop Tait recognized his work by giving him in 1879 the Lambeth degree of BD.<br>
<br>In 1880, on the resignation of Bishop George William Tozer, the synod chose Nuttall as bishop of Jamaica, and he was consecrated by Tait in St Paul's Cathedral on 28 October. From 1881 to 1891 he was also responsible for the supervision of the diocese of British Honduras, while his efforts among the West Indians working on the Panama Canal caused that district to be transferred temporarily in 1885 to the diocese of Jamaica. In 1883 the first meeting of the provincial synod of the West Indies was held in Jamaica, five bishops attending, and Nuttall was mainly responsible for drafting its canons and constitutions. He was elected primate of the West Indies in 1893 and in 1897, in consequence of a resolution of the West Indian bishops passed (30 July) during the Lambeth conference, he assumed the title of archbishop of the West Indies.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1907 Jamaica suffered a destructive earthquake. At the time the archbishop was attending a meeting of the West India Agricultural Conference; his coolness averted a panic, and his immediate organization and guidance of all the measures for relief and reconstruction were beyond praise. Throughout his fifty-four years in Jamaica he was intimately concerned in the daily welfare of the islanders&#151;education, nursing, housing, agriculture&#151;and was in constant consultation with the Colonial Office at home.<br>
<br>Nuttall married in 1867 Elizabeth Duggan, daughter of the Revd Philip Chapman, a Wesleyan minister, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. In his later years, in spite of frequent visits to England, his health failed, though he continued to work. He died at Bishop's Lodge, Kingston, on 31 May 1916, and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew, Halfway Tree, in Jamaica.<br>
