<span class="headword">Stopes,  Leonard</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1608), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, is of unknown parentage. He may have been a member of the Stopes family of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and a brother of James Stopes, whose son James was the rector of St Mary Magdalene, Old Fish Street, London, from 1577 to 1624. He is very likely to have had some kind of London connection, since in 1555 he was chosen as one of the original scholars of St John's College, Oxford, which took thirty-seven of its first fifty students from London, drawing heavily from the Merchant Taylors' School. He graduated BA on 23 October 1558 and proceeded MA on 21 March 1559; he was described as a &#145;priest&#146; in 1559  (Stevenson and Salter, 327). In February 1559 the founder of St John's, Sir Thomas White, presented Stopes to the vicarage of Northmoor, Oxfordshire, but, apparently refusing to conform to the new protestant order, he had resigned from that living, or perhaps been ejected, by 9 July. He escaped to France with another Catholic priest, Ralph Windon, and joined the English College at Douai. Windon and Stopes were later sent back to England as missionaries, but were arrested and imprisoned at Wisbech Castle, Cambridgeshire, where they are recorded as inmates in 1595. Stopes was eventually released and exiled to France. He died there about 1608.<br>
<br>While at Oxford, Stopes wrote &#145;Haile Mary, full of grace&#146;, a poem of twenty-four verses in praise of Mary I, printed as a broadside in <span class="italic">An Ave Maria in Commendation of our most Vertuous Queene</span> by Richard Lant in 1553. Lant was imprisoned in 1559 for printing &#145;An Epitaph on the Death of Queen Mary&#146;, another broadside, which Stopes may also have written. The surviving copies of both broadsides are in the library of the Society of Antiquaries, London.<br>
