<span class="headword">O'Kelly,  Dennis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1728&#150;1787), <span class="occ">racehorse owner</span>, was born in Ireland of &#145;humble&#146; parents, and had no formal education. After arriving in London about 1748, aged twenty, he became first a chair carrier, and then kept the scores at the billiard table and tennis court. However, he soon met Charlotte Hayes (<i>d</i>. 1787), a noted courtesan whom he later married. She financed his gambling speculations, the success of which provided him with capital. His major break occurred when he paid 650 guineas for a part-share in Eclipse, a horse that had never run a race. The purchase paid off, Eclipse rapidly demonstrating that it was the best horse of the day by winning its first race, the Queen's Plate at Winchester, with such style that O'Kelly was able to collect on a famous bet that he had made&#151;he had wagered that Eclipse would be at least 240 yards ahead of the rest of the field; everyone was amazed at such a feat, and this prompted O'Kelly to pay a further 1100 guineas to become the animal's sole owner.<br>
<br>O'Kelly's earnings from Eclipse were undermined by three factors: the most valuable races at Newmarket were confined to horses belonging to the Jockey Club, an &eacute;lite body which refused to admit O'Kelly; Eclipse's reputation meant that it was difficult to arrange matches elsewhere, for few owners would back their horses against him; and Eclipse was &#145;an indifferent foal getter&#146;, thus limiting its value as a stud  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, 6, 1795, 119). Despite this, O'Kelly rejected an offer of 11,000 guineas for the horse. O'Kelly's primary goal was fame rather than money, and he much preferred racing his horses to selling them. Much of his behaviour was probably motivated by a resentment of his treatment by aristocrats, particularly his exclusion from membership of clubs patronized by the higher orders. In addition, he alleged that he had been sold &#145;half-bred&#146; mares with false signatures testifying to their pedigree. These factors go some way towards explaining his regular denunciations of aristocrats as &#145;black-legs&#146;.<br>
<br>Betting, on both horses and cards, allied to the profits from his breeding stud, made O'Kelly a very rich man, though one who was regarded as &#145;a disreputable adventurer&#146;  (Black, 150). Money enabled him to gain some admittance to society, notably his purchase of commissions in the Middlesex militia, in which he eventually attained the rank of colonel. He also bought a country house at Clay Hill, Epsom, and subsequently the famous estate of Cannons, near Edgware, formerly the house of the duke of Chandos.<br>
<br>O'Kelly was described as having &#145;a bear-like figure, dark and saturnine visage, with the accompaniment of his rough striped coat and old round hat&#146;. Although his looks resembled a ruffian, he was very &#145;peaceable&#146; and had &#145;the manners of a gentleman, and the attractive quaintness of the humorist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> 6, 1795, 98&#150;100). Contradictions permeated his nature. His kindness towards his servants made them &#145;look at him more as a friend than a master&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, 2, 1793, 335) and he retained jockeys on an annual basis, permitting them to ride for other owners providing they did not ride against him. However, he displayed immense meanness in almost all of his business transactions, and jockeys invariably struggled to be paid. Similarly, although he was a heavy gambler and had no interest in religion, he refused to permit play at his own table. Indeed, he inserted a clause in his will specifically punishing his heir should he gamble.<br>
<br>O'Kelly died childless at his house in Piccadilly Grove, London, on 28 December 1787 and was interred in a vault at Whitechapel. While he left his widow well provided for, including the bequest of a famous parrot that he had bought for 50 guineas, which was able to whistle the 104th psalm, the bulk of his estate went to his nephew, Andrew Dennis O'Kelly, who had been educated in England and France. Despite his uncle's stipulations Andrew embraced horse-racing, and was so successful as both owner and jockey that he became a member of the Jockey Club. He was regarded with respect both by contemporaries and by posterity&#151;something Dennis O'Kelly never achieved.<br>
