<span class="headword">Lupton,  Donald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1676), <span class="occ">clergyman and writer</span>, was born of unknown parents. The place of his education is unknown, but he took an MA degree and presumably was ordained by 1627, when he served as a chaplain with the English troops in Germany. He was with the force commanded by Sir Charles Morgan that landed in April 1627 and subsequently with the garrison of Stade until its surrender in April 1628. He later wrote that he had many years' experience abroad. Lupton was in London by 1632, when he published <span class="italic">London and the Countrey Carbonadoed and Quartred into Severall Characters</span>, which is a characterization of aspects of life and places in the city and the provinces. Dedicated to Lord Goring, this is largely light-hearted and witty in tone, but contains some critical comments, such as those concerning animal baiting. In 1636 Lupton's <span class="italic">Emblems of Rarities</span> was published&#151;a wide-ranging selection of brief items covering history, topography, social customs, and natural history, interspersed with legends and fantastic tales.<br>
<br>Lupton's first publication on spiritual matters was <span class="italic">Objectorum reductio, or, Daily Imployment for the Soule</span> (1634), consisting of a set of fifty-nine homilies on both biblical and everyday topics. It was followed by <span class="italic">The History of the Moderne Protestant Divines</span> (1637), covering the lives and beliefs of prominent continental and English scholars, and <span class="italic">The Glory of their Times, or, The Lives of the Primitive Fathers</span> (1640), which has accounts of leading scholars down to Thomas Aquinas. In March 1642 the House of Commons was told of &#145;dangerous Words&#146; spoken by Mr Lupton, a clergyman, and the case was referred to the committee for scandalous ministers. There is, however, no evidence that it was Donald Lupton who was reported.<br>
<br>Lupton's later books were less substantial. With the outbreak of civil war he drew on his earlier experiences in writing <span class="italic">A Warre-Like Treatise of the Pike</span> (1642), dedicated to the earl of Essex, the parliamentarian lord general. In it he argued against the continued use of the pike and in favour of the musket and short pike, and included an examination of the morality of the soldier's profession, acknowledging the deleterious effects of warfare.<br>
<br>By 1652 Lupton was no longer living in London, but his observations during a visit prompted <span class="italic">The Freedom of Preaching, or, Spiritual Gifts Defended</span>. He considered that laymen from any background who were so gifted should be permitted to preach, and was critical of the presbyterian clergy for their restrictiveness. But his pleas for greater toleration did not extend to the Quakers, whom he castigated in <span class="italic">The Quacking Mountebanck, or, The Jesuite Turn'd Quaker</span> (1655). Lupton was also critical of the clergy and lay impropriators in two pamphlets against tithes, <span class="italic">The Tythe-Takers Cart Overthrown, or, The Downfall of Tythes</span> and <span class="italic">The Two Main questions Resolved &hellip; if Tythes be Put Down</span>, both dated 1652. He condemned the existing system and suggested that the clergy could be maintained by a fixed levy.<br>
<br>State affairs attracted Lupton's attention during the wars with the United Provinces and Spain. In <span class="italic">England's Command on the Seas, or, The English Seas Guarded</span> (1653) he justified the government's policy of upholding England's maritime rights. His <span class="italic">Flanders, or, An Exact and Compendious Description of the Fair, Great, and Fat Countrey of Flanders</span> (1658) was prompted by the English army's campaign there and includes a description of Dunkirk, recently ceded to England, and an account of the battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600. On 27 March 1663 Lupton was appointed by the dean and chapter of St Paul's as vicar of Sunbury, Middlesex. He died in 1676 and was buried at Sunbury on 8 March.<br>
