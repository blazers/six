<span class="headword">Ponsonby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spencer]</span>,  Henrietta Frances <span class="st"> [Harriet]</span></span>, countess of Bessborough  (1761&#150;1821), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was born on 16 June 1761, in Wimbledon, Surrey, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38713/', "John Spencer, first Earl Spencer (1734&#150;1783)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39563/', "Margaret Georgiana Spencer (n&#233;e Poyntz) (1737&#150;1814)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer (1758&#150;1834)")</script> was her brother. Tall, handsome, and possessed of a penetrating mind, Harriet (as she was called) was never able to escape comparison with her celebrated sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4934/', "Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire (1757&#150;1806)")</script>. However, Harriet was devoted to the duchess to the point of obsession, and willingly allowed her to take centre stage. Like her sister she was intimately involved in whig party politics. Her letters were of the highest quality and remain a valuable source for students of the period.<br>
<br>Harriet grew up in the shadow of Georgiana, whose natural ebullience and charisma won her a large following even before she was married. Yet, when it came to be Harriet's turn to marry, she chose to strengthen the association with her sister rather than loosen it. Her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63967/', "Frederick Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon, later third earl of Bessborough (1758&#150;1844)")</script>, was the duke of Devonshire's cousin. She admitted to having misgivings about his character, but told her friends she liked the idea because, &#145;by marrying him she made no new connections, for now her sister's and hers would be the same&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/29/4/7, fol. 77). The Spencers also supported the match, but feared that the Duncannons would fall into debt if they tried to emulate the lifestyle of the Devonshires. Unfortunately their worries proved to be prophetic. Harriet and Lord Duncannon married on 27 November 1780 at Spencer House, and soon became immersed in the reckless hedonism of the Devonshire House circle. In imitation of her sister she became addicted to gambling and acquired several hundred thousand pounds' worth of debts. Furthermore, Harriet's misgivings about her husband turned out to be justified. Duncannon acquired a reputation for being an abusive and jealous husband who was prepared to go to extreme lengths to gain control of his wife's financial settlement. On several occasions the Devonshires and the Spencers were forced to intervene on Harriet's behalf. Nevertheless, the marriage produced four children over seven years: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22500/', "John William Ponsonby, later fourth earl of Bessborough (1781&#150;1847)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22493/', "Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby (1783&#150;1837)")</script>, Caroline [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15911/', "Lamb, Lady Caroline (1785&#150;1828)")</script>], and William, later first Baron de Mauley (1787&#150;1855).<br>
<br>In 1784 Harriet campaigned alongside her sister in support of Charles James Fox at the Westminster election. The duchess was blamed by the press for exchanging kisses for votes, although the true culprit appears to have been Harriet. After the election she continued to act as her sister's lieutenant but had to accept the permanent presence of Lady Elizabeth Foster, who had become the duke of Devonshire's mistress and the duchess's confidante. It was at this time that she had a series of love affairs, one of which almost resulted in an elopement. However, Harriet seemed to find some stability with the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751&#150;1816)")</script>. This affair was public knowledge in whig society but Lord Duncannon discovered it only in 1789. After Harriet broke her promise to end the relationship, Duncannon began divorce proceedings. They had reached an advanced stage when the duke of Devonshire persuaded him to attempt a reconciliation. This time Harriet kept her promise; several years later, however, Sheridan developed an infatuation tinged with madness for her which remained unabated at the time of his death.<br>
<br>In 1791 Harriet and the duchess were involved in a shares scandal that resulted in huge financial losses for them both. Harriet suffered a total physical collapse which left her partially paralysed. Although the family insisted publicly that the illness was due to a miscarriage, there is circumstantial evidence that the real cause may have been either a botched abortion or an attempted suicide. She was beginning to recover when Devonshire discovered that the duchess was pregnant by Charles Grey. He agreed not to divorce her if Harriet would consent to take Georgiana abroad, using her poor health as the pretext. Consequently the Duncannons led a cavalcade to Europe which included their daughter, Caroline, the duchess of Devonshire, Lady Elizabeth Foster, and her daughter, Georgiana, Countess Spencer, and several friends. Either the climate or proximity to Lord Duncannon brought on a relapse of Harriet's illness. The party moved to southern Italy in search of dry air and warmth. During their stay in Naples in 1793 Harriet met and fell in love with a handsome diplomat twelve years her junior called <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16542/', "Granville Leveson-Gower (1773&#150;1846)")</script>. This was her last and most serious love affair. Harriet rapidly recovered and by the time of her return to London in 1794 her lungs and mobility were restored. Her affair with Leveson-Gower continued for a further fifteen years, producing Harriette Arundel Stewart (1800&#150;1852) and George Arundel Stewart (1802&#150;1875). However, like the duchess and her child with Charles Grey, she was unable to acknowledge either child as her own which caused her lifelong pain.<br>
<br>Harriet's relationship with her legitimate children was close and loving. Although she frequently clashed with her daughter, Caroline, Harriet adored her and worried about her future. She tried to persuade her against marrying William Lamb, the future Lord Melbourne, doubting that he understood her high-strung daughter. The marriage, famously, was a disaster. Harriet was devastated by the death of her sister in 1806. &#145;No one knows, G,&#146; she wrote to Leveson-Gower, &#145;not even you&#151;how I suffer&#146;  (Leveson-Gower, 2.230). Her sense of loneliness was increased by two more blows. First Lady Elizabeth Foster married the duke of Devonshire in 1809, causing Harriet to question whether she had been deceived by her all along. In the following year Granville Leveson-Gower married her niece, Georgiana's daughter, Lady Harriet Cavendish, causing considerable heartache to Harriet, and awkwardness and embarrassment between the related families. In later years she felt bitter about the relationship and wondered if he had ever loved her as much as she loved him. Harriet remained a popular figure in London and Paris, but as her age advanced she preferred the comforting familiarity of whig society. Her greatest consolation was in her relationship with her sons and grandchildren. She would frequently stay with them, and died on 11 November 1821 in Florence, Italy, while on holiday with her youngest son and daughter-in-law, and was buried in the Cavendish vault at All Saints', Derby.<br>
