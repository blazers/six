<span class="headword">Morgan,  David Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1695&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite campaigner</span>, was the only son of Thomas Morgan of Pen-y-graig House, Glamorgan, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of David Mathew of Llandaff Court. His father, an under-sheriff of Glamorgan in 1682, was a distant connection of the influential Morgan of Tredegar family, while his mother was the first cousin of Admiral Thomas Mathews. This was a powerful whig connection, but Morgan followed a quite different political path. He was educated at the Middle Temple (admitted 1711, called 1721), and practised at Westminster Hall and probably also on his home Brecon circuit of south-east Wales. He married a London woman (identity unknown), through whom he acquired property in Shoreditch. They had one daughter, Mary. Although he inherited Pen-y-graig House, in the then rural parish of Merthyr Tudful, he spent most of his time in London, albeit not in assiduous pursuit of his profession. &#145;As to my capacity as one bred to the law, I confess that I never pretended to much knowledge that way&#146;, he said at his treason trial. Morgan claimed then to have served in two military campaigns on behalf of the crown, and he was certainly a man of many parts. A devout Anglican, he set out his faith in a book, <span class="italic">The Christian Test</span>. He also sufficiently dabbled in verse for Horace Walpole to call him &#145;a poetical lawyer&#146; at his execution  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.287). But his chief diversion was politics. He wrote a pamphlet attacking Sir Robert Walpole for corruption, and in the 1740s was a member of an opposition organization, the Independent Electors of Westminster, before he took part in the Jacobite rising of 1745.<br>
<br>Together with Monmouthshire squire William Vaughan of Courtfield, Morgan joined the army of Charles Edward Stuart at Preston. As Squire Morgan he busied himself in Manchester, recruiting and requisitioning arms. He was offered but declined command of the &#145;Manchester regiment&#146;, and was co-opted onto the prince's council as an expert on England, his legal status earning him the nickname &#145;the Pretender's Counsellor&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.287). He argued that Wales should be the target destination both from Manchester and after the retreat from Derby, where he strongly advocated a bold march on London. Reputedly declaring, &#145;I had rather be <i>hanged</i> than go to Scotland to <i>starve</i>&#146;, he deserted the Jacobite army in Staffordshire on 7 December, and was at once arrested at Stone and put in Stafford gaol. There on 9 December he asked for pardon, denying that he had been a rebel, and took the same line at his trial in London from 18 to 22 July 1746. A succession of witnesses, including his own servant John Barry, there described how he had paraded at Preston with a white cockade and sword, and how on the march to Manchester and Derby he often rode alongside the Pretender. Morgan's defence was that he had been taken prisoner by the rebels while visiting friends in Cheshire, and had escaped at the first opportunity. This was so unconvincing that the jury found him guilty of high treason without leaving the courtroom. Morgan was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, beheaded, and quartered. The execution took place on 30 July 1746, when he was about fifty-one, and his head was stuck up at Temple Bar. His last request was for coffee &#145;very good and strong&#146;. Posthumous blackening of his character is reflected in this observation from Howell's <span class="italic">State Trials</span>  (18.389):<blockquote>He was a person of a very mean look, and seldom kept company with any gentleman of his neighbourhood; and if it had not been for his estate, he might have starved, for he was so very lofty, and of so bad a temper, that nobody but such as were beholden to him cared to employ him.</blockquote>
