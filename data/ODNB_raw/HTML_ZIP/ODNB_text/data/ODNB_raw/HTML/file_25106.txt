<span class="headword">Serres <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilmot]</span>,  Olivia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Princess Olive of Cumberland]</span>  (1772&#150;1835), <span class="occ">royal impostor</span>, was born in Warwick on 3 April 1772, daughter of Robert Wilmot, house painter, and his wife, Anna Maria Brunton. She was baptized on 15 April 1772 at St Nicholas's Church, Warwick. Her father having embezzled the county rates, her parents subsequently moved to London, and Olivia spent much of her youth in the house of her uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29622/', "Dr James Wilmot")</script>, fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and rector of Barton on the Heath, Warwickshire. In 1790, two men were hanged for burglary on her evidence. She married, on 1 September 1791, at Barton on the Heath, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25104/', "John Thomas Serres (1759&#150;1825)")</script> who had been her drawing master in London and who in 1793 was appointed marine painter to the king. She was at this time under age, and the marriage was conducted by special licence, her father having sworn an affidavit to their relationship and consenting to the marriage. The marriage was unhappy, and the couple separated in 1802, having had two daughters and at least one son.<br>
<br>Olivia Serres supported herself by painting and teaching, exhibiting landscapes at the Royal Academy between 1793 and 1808, and at the British Institution from 1806 to 1811; her work has been accounted competent. In 1806 she was appointed landscape painter to the prince of Wales, whom she subsequently plagued with an incoherent correspondence. During this period she also produced a number of romantic literary works, including a novel, <span class="italic">St Julian</span> (1805), <span class="italic">Flights of Fancy: Poems</span> (1806), and an opera, <span class="italic">The Castle of Avola</span> (1805). She came into the public eye in 1813, when she published a memoir of her uncle, Dr Wilmot, who had died in 1807, under the title <span class="italic">The Life of the Author of Junius's Letters, the Revd James Wilmot, DD</span>, claiming that she had documents to prove that he was the anonymous author of the controversial letters of the 1770s. A lengthy and heated argument in the pages of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> ensued, which demonstrated the absurdity of Mrs Serres's assertions. The correspondence revealed a deep sense of paranoia: she wrote that &#145;I have, too, <i>political enemies&#151;powerful ones</i>, whose characters and transactions, &hellip; have subjected me to much secret oppression&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1813, 414). In a pamphlet in 1817, she sought to re-establish the authenticity of her case, on the basis of the handwriting in the documents which were assumed by everyone else to be forged.<br>
<br>In 1817, the imposture escalated. Olivia Serres made her first claim to being the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12963/', "Henry Frederick, duke of Cumberland")</script>, brother of George III. In a petition to the prince regent in 1818 she alleged that she was the daughter of the duke and a Mrs Payne, a sister of Dr Wilmot, and wife of a captain in the Royal Navy. Following the death of George III, her delusions of grandeur increased. Now she claimed to be the <i>legitimate</i> daughter of the duke: she styled herself the Princess Olive of Cumberland, placed the royal arms on a coach she had hired, and dressed her servants in the royal livery. According to her fantasy, Dr Wilmot was married secretly to the Princess Poniatouski, sister of King Stanislaus of Poland, from which marriage a daughter was born. This daughter, who was brought up by Wilmot's sister, Mrs Payne, came to the attention of the duke of Cumberland who married her on 4 March 1767. Mrs Serres claimed to be the daughter of this marriage, and to have been substituted for a stillborn daughter of the Robert Wilmots, who were subsequently reputed to be her parents. She offered a large quantity of documents as corroborative evidence, including papers apparently written or witnessed by the earl of Warwick, who had died in 1816.<br>
<br>In July 1821 Olivia Serres was arrested for debt, but she moved that the proceedings be stayed on grounds that as a member of the royal family she was exempt from arrest in civil cases. She had herself rechristened in September 1821 at Islington as Olive, daughter of the duke of Cumberland and his first wife, Olive, but the privilege was denied, on grounds that she had already put in bail. At this point she produced what purported to be an early will by George III, leaving &pound;15,000 to &#145;Olive, the daughter of our brother of Cumberland&#146;, and in 1822 applied through the courts to see George III's will. This was also denied, on grounds that the courts had no jurisdiction over royal wills.<br>
<br>Mrs Serres was not without supporters. The <span class="italic">British Luminary</span> took up her cause, and the genealogist Henry Nugent Bell was said to have reported favourably on it. More importantly, Sir Gerald Noel presented a petition to parliament in 1823, and in June moved that it be referred to a select committee, which motion was seconded by the radical Joseph Hume. Sir Robert Peel refuted her claims on the floor of the house by proving that her documents were fabricated, and caused much mirth by pointing out that if her English claims were rejected, &#145;the lady had two strings to her bow&#146;, for she had also claimed to be a legitimate descendant of the kings of Poland  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1823, 637&#150;8). The motion was rejected without a division.<br>
<br>The estranged husband of Olivia Serres, John Thomas Serres, who had been cast out of royal favour on account of his wife's pretensions, died in poverty in the rules of the king's bench on 28 December 1825, and in his will repudiated any belief in Olivia's claims. She herself died in the rules of the king's bench, in Trinity Square, Southwark, on 21 November 1835 and was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly, on 3 December, under the name of Olive Cumberland. In her will, which was sworn at under &pound;20, she left 1<i>s</i>. to each of &#145;my cousins of the Royal House of Guelph &hellip; to enable them to purchase a prayer for to teach them repentence for their past cruelties and injuries to myself, their legitimate and lawful cousin&#146;  (Pendered and Mallett, 266&#150;7). In addition to the works published under her own name, she wrote much anonymously, and was probably responsible for the publication of the <span class="italic">Secret History of the Court of England</span> which appeared under Lady Anne Hamilton's name in 1828.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25105"></a><span class="headword">Lavinia Janetta Horton Ryves</span>  (1797&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span> was the elder daughter and eldest surviving child of Olivia and John Thomas Serres. Born in Liverpool in 1797, her childhood was disrupted by the disputes of her parents, and throughout her life she had divided loyalties. In 1822 she married the portrait painter Anthony Thomas Ryves (<i>d</i>. 1873?), with whom she had six children before divorcing him for cruelty and misconduct, in 1841. Her father opposed the marriage, and cut her out of his will in favour of her younger sister, Britannia. Following her mother's death in 1835, she styled herself Princess Lavinia of Cumberland and duchess of Lancaster, and asserted the legitimacy of her mother's claims. Sir Gerald Noel again took up the case, forming a committee of supporters, and attempts were made in 1842 and 1844 to claim the &pound;15,000 supposedly left to Mrs Serres by George III. The claim failed, the court of chancery maintaining again that it had no jurisdiction over royal wills. In 1858 she published <span class="italic">An appeal for royalty: a letter to her most gracious majesty Queen Victoria from Lavinia, princess of Cumberland and duchess of Lancaster</span>, in which were published all the documents in the case, including those relating to a supposed marriage between George III and Hannah Lightfoot. In 1861 she obtained a declaration of the validity of her parents' marriage under the <span class="roman">Legitimacy Declaration Act</span>, and in 1866 brought a further case (with her son, William Henry Ryves) seeking a declaration that the duke of Cumberland and Olive Wilmot were lawfully married, and that Olive (Olivia), later Mrs Serres, was their legitimate child. The attorney-general, Sir Roundell Palmer, opposed their petition, and the jury found unanimously that the documents were forgeries. Following the rejection of her claims, Lavinia Ryves published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Ryves v. the Attorney-General: was Justice Done?</span> in 1868. She died on 7 December 1871 at Haverstock Hill, London.<br>
