<span class="headword">Hearn,  (Patricio) Lafcadio Carlos</span> <span class="st"> [Yakumo Koizumi]</span>  (1850&#150;1904), <span class="occ">author and translator</span>, was born on the Ionian island of Santa Maura, Greece, on 27 June 1850, the eldest surviving child of Surgeon-Major Charles Bush Hearn (<i>d</i>. 1866), later of the East India Company, and his first wife, Rosa Antonia Cassimati. The marriage, ever turbulent, failed when Hearn was four, and the boy, abandoned by his parents, spent a troubled childhood in Dublin in the company of Sarah Brenane, his father's aunt. Because of Brenane, who longed for her nephew to become a Roman Catholic priest, Hearn was educated in Jesuit seminaries in Paris and Yvetot, France, as well as at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, near Durham, where he lost one of his eyes to schoolboy bullying.<br>
<br>In 1869, when Hearn was nineteen, Brenane was swindled out of her fortune and she cut Hearn adrift. For the next several years he washed dishes and lived in cardboard boxes on the streets of London, New York, and Cincinnati, comparing his life (as Edmund Gosse was to do after him) to Thomas De Quincey's <span class="italic">Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</span>. Then, in 1873, Hearn got his big break as a newspaper man, first as a typesetter and then as Old Semi-Colon on the <span class="italic">Cincinnati Enquirer</span>. He quickly achieved notoriety for grisly depictions of death&#151;he once plunged his fingers into the boiling brains of a corpse, he ice-skated on frozen gore, and he drank blood at the abattoirs when that craze had fallen on the people of Cincinnati. But Hearn's popularity as a slaughter-house journalist had little effect on his finances, and his existence was beset by starvation and disease as he migrated from Cincinnati to New Orleans and the West Indies (possibly even taking the voodoo queen, Marie Laveau, as his lover, after a failed marriage to Althea Foley, a cook and former slave). His first stabs at literature, written during this period, were lurid and over-coloured, such as his translation of Gautier, entitled <span class="italic">Cleopatra's Nights and other Fantastic Romances</span> (1882), and his original volumes of short stories, <span class="italic">Stray Leaves from Strange Literature</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">Some Chinese Ghosts</span> (1887). But the tone of these writings reveals Hearn's growing obsession with the East, which, he said, &#145;perfumed my mind as with the incense of a strangely new and beautiful worship&#146;  (Hearn to W. D. O'Connor, 1883, Wetmore, 1.291).<br>
<br>As a result, in 1890, when Hearn got the chance to go to Japan as a journalist working for <span class="italic">Harper's Weekly</span>, the experience was profound. Within a week of landing in Yokohama, on 4 April 1890, Hearn quit <span class="italic">Harper's</span> and found work as an English teacher in the tiny coastal town of Matsue, where, in 1891, he married Setsu Koizumi, daughter of a samurai, converted to Buddhism, and, in 1896, gave up his British passport to become Yakumo Koizumi, a Japanese citizen. For the next fifteen years Hearn specialized as a Western interpreter of Japan, publishing thirteen volumes composed in the Japanese <i>zuihitsu</i> style (miscellaneous essays which follow the idiosyncratic flow of the pen). Merging folk superstitions, Buddhist and Shinto philosophy, and ancient stories within his own fleeting impressions, Hearn's project was to present not himself to his readers but the beauties of an &#145;authentic&#146; Japanese literature. Among his works, published both in London and Boston, were <span class="italic">Glimpses of an Unfamiliar Japan</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Gleanings in Buddha-Fields</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Exotics and Retrospectives</span> (1898), <span class="italic">Kotto: being Japanese Curios with Sundry Cobwebs</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things</span> (1904). Only <span class="italic">Japan: an Attempt at Interpretation</span> (1904) had anything analytical about it, while in each book his passionate and sometimes mystical prose so glorified Japan that Hearn has remained a favoured author among the Japanese. Hearn also held a prestigious lectureship in English at the Imperial University of Tokyo from 1896 to 1903. He seems to have been universally beloved by his students, who remembered him as gentle and affectionate, devoid of the anger and paranoia that so upset his human relationships in the West, though partial blindness and chronic illness continued to plague him.<br>
<br>On 26 September 1904, at his <i>yashiki</i> in Okubo, Toyko, Hearn died from a heart attack, surrounded by his wife and children&#151;Kazuo, Iwao, Kiyoshi, and Suzuko. He was buried in Tokyo's Zoshigaya Buddhist cemetery in a ceremony attended by more than 200 Japanese. A century after his death, Hearn's popularity is still evident in Japan's wealth of Hearn museums and other &#145;Hearniana&#146;. His stories are still used to teach children English, and <span class="italic">Kwaidan</span> was made into a film by the Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi, winner at the Cannes Film Festival in 1965. Wrote Yone Noguchi, the celebrated Japanese poet, &#145;To denounce Hearn is the same thing as a denunciation of Japan. Lafcadio Hearn was as Japanese as haiku&#146;  (Noguchi, 20).<br>
