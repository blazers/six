<span class="headword">Tatwine <span class="st"> [Tatwin]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 734), <span class="occ">scholar and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, is known almost entirely from Bede, who in his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 5.23) notes that before his election to Canterbury, Tatwine had been a priest at the monastery of Briudun (Breedon on the Hill, Leicestershire), and that he was &#145;renowned for his devotion and wisdom and excellently instructed in the Scriptures&#146;. Breedon, which had been founded in the 680s, was one of the great minster-churches of central Mercia, sited in a commanding position in an Iron Age hill fort, and (at a time after Tatwine's death, perhaps <i>c</i>.800) embellished with a spectacular collection of carved friezes; the prestige of the church is reflected in the fact that one of its priests could be elected to the archiepiscopacy. Tatwine was consecrated by four bishops at Canterbury on Sunday 10 June 731. Two years later, having received his pallium from Rome, he himself ordained bishops for Lindsey and Selsey. He died on 30 July 734 and was buried at Canterbury.<br>
<br>The quality of Tatwine's scholarship is clearly seen in the two works which have survived in his name: a grammar and a collection of forty metrical <i>enigmata</i>. The grammar, properly entitled the <span class="italic">Ars de partibus orationis</span>, is an example of what has been termed an &#145;elementary&#146; grammar; that is to say, its structure is modelled on the earlier grammatical treatises (<span class="italic">Ars maior</span>, <span class="italic">Ars minor</span>) of Donatus in that it treats the parts of speech&#151;noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, participle, conjunction, preposition, and interjection&#151;in sequence, illustrating the inflecting parts with series of paradigms, especially of verbs (to which he also devoted an additional appendix). In compiling his grammar Tatwine drew principally on the earlier grammatical treatises of Priscian and Consentius, as well as on the late antique commentators on Donatus, such as Pompeius and Servius; the heavy use of these sources, as well as occasional use of a number of others, implies that Tatwine had at his disposal a well-stocked library. On occasion Tatwine supplemented the examples found in his sources by means of biblical quotations, especially from the psalms. The most striking feature of Tatwine's grammar is its clear exposition of grammatical categories, a feature which made it especially useful for English-speaking beginners for whom Latin was not a native language.<br>
<br>The surviving manuscripts of Tatwine's <span class="italic">Ars de partibus orationis</span> (three complete manuscripts of the late eighth century and a fragmentary one of the late ninth) were all written on the continent; but although no English manuscript of the work survives, there is no doubt that it was studied intensively in Anglo-Saxon schools, because in all four continental manuscripts Tatwine's lists of nouns are frequently accompanied by glosses in Old English, which the Carolingian scribes evidently took over from their (English) exemplars. But whatever its utility for beginners, the fact that no Carolingian grammarian shows any debt to Tatwine's grammar indicates that this utility had been superseded by the ninth century.<br>
<br>Tatwine's other surviving work is a collection of forty <i>enigmata</i> (literally &#145;mysteries&#146;, a term used by early Anglo-Latin authors to describe metrical riddles). These forty <i>enigmata</i> are framed by a vast acrostic with two legends; the first letter of the first line of each of the forty poems participates in the first acrostic (<span class="smallcap">SVB DENO QVATER HAEC DIVERSE ENIGMATA TORQVENS</span>), and the last letter of each first line participates in the second (<span class="smallcap">STAMINE METRORVM EXSTRVCTOR CONSERTA RETEXIT</span>). The poems themselves, which vary from four to twelve lines in length, are concerned with both the physical aspects of Christian life (many of the <i>enigmata</i> describe objects such as &#145;parchment&#146;, &#145;pen&#146;, &#145;bell&#146;, &#145;altar&#146;, &#145;paten&#146;, &#145;lectern&#146;) and the spiritual (&#145;love&#146;, &#145;evil&#146;, &#145;humility&#146;, &#145;pride&#146;), as well as the ways in which its profound message must be interpreted (the opening sequence of <i>enigmata</i> treats such subjects as &#145;wisdom&#146;, &#145;faith, hope, and charity&#146;, &#145;the four ways of interpreting scripture&#146;, &#145;literature&#146;). A few of the <i>enigmata</i> reflect Tatwine's occupation as schoolmaster (for example, one <i>enigma</i> treats &#145;prepositions which take two cases&#146;). The diction of the poems is highly compressed, sometimes to the point of incomprehensibility, and reveals substantial familiarity with classical Latin poets, especially Virgil and Horace, as well as with the techniques of composing quantitative verse (though there are occasional infelicities in the placement of caesurae).<br>
<br>It is not possible to determine when or where Tatwine composed these two literary works. According to a metrical epitaph which (presumably) adorned his tomb in Canterbury, he was at the time of his death &#145;worn down with the burden of old age&#146;  (Lapidge, 370&#150;71). These words possibly imply that he was in his sixties or seventies when he died (hence that he was born <i>c</i>.670, and was thus contemporary with Bede). It is reasonable to infer that his scholarly production belongs to an earlier phase of his life, certainly to that before his elevation to Canterbury, and may be roughly dated to the years around 700; in other words, that Tatwine's scholarship belongs to the first period of florescence of Anglo-Latin literature in late seventh-century Southumbria.<br>
