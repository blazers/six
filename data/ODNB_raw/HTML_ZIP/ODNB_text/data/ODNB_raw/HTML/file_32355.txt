<span class="headword">Chambers,  Raymond Wilson</span>  (1874&#150;1942), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at Staxton, on the Yorkshire wolds, on 12 November 1874, the only son of Thomas Herbert Chambers, commercial traveller, and his wife, Annie, daughter of William Wilson. As a boy he knew privation. He was educated at the Grocers' Company's School and at University College, London, where he graduated in 1894 with a first class in English. After working in various libraries, among them the Guildhall Library, he returned in 1899 as Quain student to University College, where he remained thereafter. There he was in close contact over a period of years with such eminent men as A. E. Housman and W. P. Ker. His own contribution to the college, both as librarian and as teacher, was outstanding. He became a fellow in 1900, librarian in the next year, and assistant professor of English in 1904. In the First World War he served for a time as an orderly at a base hospital in France, and briefly with the YMCA in Belgium.<br>
<br>Although all Chambers's academic work came under the general heading of English studies, its range was nevertheless considerable, extending in time from early Germanic legend and history to Shakespeare and Milton, and occasionally beyond, and in kind from textual study to literary criticism and biography. His earliest book was <span class="italic">Widsith: a Study in Old English Heroic Legend</span> which was published in 1912, the same year in which he was awarded a DLitt degree from the University of London. This work, along with his edition of <span class="italic">Beowulf</span> (1914), which represented a very thorough revision of A. J. Wyatt's edition, and his <span class="italic">Beowulf: an Introduction to the Study of the Poem</span> (1921) placed Chambers among the foremost Old English scholars.<br>
<br>In 1922 Chambers succeeded Ker as Quain professor of English language and literature, and he held the chair until 1941 when the college made him a special lecturer. He was elected FBA in 1927, and maintained close relations with the British Academy, lecturing before it on several occasions and becoming a member of its council in 1937. By this time his reputation as a scholar was widely recognized. He was made an honorary member of the Modern Language Association of America in 1930, and gave the Turnbull lectures at Johns Hopkins University in 1933 and the Clark lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1935. He was president of the Philological Society in 1933 and honorary director of the Early English Text Society from 1938 until his death.<br>
<br>Chambers also had a part in the facsimile edition <span class="italic">The Exeter Book of Old English Poetry</span> (1933), which was his last publication in this field; his contribution was recognized with honorary doctorates from the universities of Durham (1932) and Leeds (1936). Prior to any of this work, however, he had begun his study of <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>. Although the definitive edition, which was his aim, was never completed, he wrote and inspired a number of articles which contributed to the solution of some knotty problems. Another subject that long engaged his attention was the literary and historical significance of Sir Thomas More. The book that resulted, <span class="italic">Thomas More</span> (1935), made Chambers's name known outside academic circles and called forth the unusual tribute (to an Anglican) of a letter of thanks from Pope Pius XI. It was awarded the James Tait Black memorial prize. Included in it is Chambers's essay &#145;On the continuity of English prose from Alfred to Sir Thomas More&#146;, an important and influential corrective to current orthodoxies.<br>
<br>Chambers had great energy and untiring intellectual curiosity; he had, in addition, gifts of imagination, wit, and humour which enabled him to put life into a recondite subject. He was a generous and voluminous letter writer. He often engaged in controversy, but only to vindicate the truth as he saw it, and always with consideration for his opponents. Although his opinions have not always stood up to further investigation, much that he wrote is likely to remain of value, particularly as a stimulus to other workers. As he grew older, Chambers's reverence for the great men of the past became ever more prominent in his writings. He admired the courage and strength of mind, grounded in religious faith and submission to discipline, that he found in More. These qualities, in some measure, he himself possessed, as his colleagues and friends discovered during the early years of the Second World War. Beneath his reserve he was a man of generous affections and strong loyalties. His relations with his invalid father and his only sister, Gertrude, were the deeper manifestations of this; the public signs were his many friendships and his capacity for successful collaboration with other scholars.<br>
<br>Chambers was unmarried. He lived with his sister in north London for many years. His recreations included holidays in Switzerland, skiing in Norway, and visits to Florence. He served as secretary of St Christopher's Working Boys' Club. When in 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War, University College migrated to Wales, Chambers went to Aberystwyth. He was taken ill in the course of a lecture tour to the scattered groups of the college, and died at 23 Sketty Road, Swansea, on 23 April 1942.<br>
