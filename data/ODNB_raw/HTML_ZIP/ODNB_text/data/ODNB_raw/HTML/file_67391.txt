<span class="headword">Dyson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Thomas]</span>,  (Barbara) Ruth</span>  (1917&#150;1997), <span class="occ">keyboard player</span>, was born on 28 March 1917 at 5 St Mark's Square, St Pancras, London, the only child of Ernest Andrews Dyson (1884&#150;1979), a doctor, from Sheffield, then serving as captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his wife, Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cornish, sister of Dr Sidney Cornish, a general practitioner in Dorking, Surrey, and&#151;after the First World War&#151;Dr Dyson's partner. She spent her childhood and most of her adult life in Dorking. She was educated at home, and in 1935 entered the Royal College of Music, where she studied the piano with Angus Morrison, the violin with W. H. Reed, and harmony with Herbert Howells.<br>
<br>At the Royal College Dyson was inspired by Kathleen Long's playing of Arne's sonata no. 3 on the piano, and became interested in the collection of old keyboard instruments in the college museum. She first played the harpsichord and clavichord at the Dorking home of the musicologist Susanne (Susi) Jeans, and she acquired a spinet, made by Robert Goble, a former assistant of Arnold Dolmetsch. On 15 November 1941 she made her Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but on the piano, with the London Women's String Orchestra; her programme included the concerto no. 5 in G minor by Thomas Arne, a composer whose work she was to perform often on the harpsichord. During the Second World War she taught music to children at the War Evacuation Day Nursery in Dorking; her settings of poems written by Rose Fyleman for the children were later published as <span class="italic">Playgames</span> (1955). She worked for the Red Cross at Dorking General Hospital as an auxiliary nurse, and toured hospitals, army camps, and factories for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) as part of the Le F&egrave;vre Piano Quartet.<br>
<br>After the war Dyson developed a career both as a harpsichordist and a pianist, playing concertos with many of the leading orchestras. As a harpsichordist she specialized in the English baroque repertory, especially the works of John Blow, while several contemporary English composers writing for early keyboard instruments, including Alan Ridout, dedicated works to her. Her collection of instruments grew to include a clavichord by Thomas Goff, virginals by Derek Adlam, and a double harpsichord by Michael Johnson.<br>
<br>On 2 May 1964 Dyson married Edward Eastaway Thomas (1918&#150;1996), a research officer with the joint intelligence bureau until 1970 and one of the team that produced <span class="italic">British Intelligence in the Second World War</span> (1971&#150;88). He was the son of Julian Thomas, government auditor, and a nephew of the poet Edward Thomas. Through her husband Dyson acquired a stepson and a stepdaughter. She taught at the Royal College of Music from 1961, and in 1964 she was appointed professor of harpsichord and piano, and lecturer in the history of early keyboard instruments, reflecting the growing enthusiasm for the harpsichord; her pupils included Robert Woolley and Melvyn Tan. She became a fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1980, and continued to teach there until 1987, writing the entry on the history of the piano for the <span class="italic">New Oxford Companion to Music</span> (1983).<br>
<br>Dyson toured extensively for the British Council, giving many recitals in Europe, mainly of English music; she lectured in fluent German to the Telemann Society in Hamburg in 1963 and in French to the world forum of the harpsichord in Paris in 1976, and she represented the United Kingdom as an adjudicator at the Bruges International Festival in 1972. She also made many recordings for the BBC archives on instruments from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Colt clavier collection, and the Royal College of Music museum of instruments, while on her own modern instruments she recorded the complete works of Herbert Howells for the clavichord, to celebrate his ninetieth birthday in 1982. In the 1980s and 1990s she made recordings with the singer and harpsichordist Peter Medhurst, including an album of Schubert songs recorded at the Colt collection and <span class="italic">For Two to Play</span> (1988), a recording of all the double-harpsichord works written up to the time of Mozart. She continued to give recitals with Peter Medhurst until the year of her death. To mark her long association with the BBC a seventieth-birthday recital, <span class="italic">Dyson's Delight</span>, was broadcast in 1987.<br>
<br>Dyson also played an important part in the musical life of Surrey. Ralph Vaughan Williams was her father's patient, and as a girl she often took part in haymaking and tea parties organized by &#145;Uncle Ralph&#146;. At the age of five she participated in one of the first children's days in the Leith Hill Musical Festival, founded in 1905 as a competitive festival for local choirs and conducted by Vaughan Williams every year until 1953; she traced her love of Bach to hearing Harold Samuel play on that occasion. Her father was a member of the committee from 1930 and chief hall steward from 1944 to 1960, and she herself helped informally as one of the &#145;nymphs&#146; before the war. She was a member of the committee from 1946 to 1962 and from 1977 to 1979, before her election as a vice-president in 1981. Vaughan Williams was a very important influence in her development as a musician. For many years after the war she played among the second violins in the festival orchestra, serving as orchestra librarian from 1948 to 1960, and from 1968 to 1995 she played the harpsichord continuo in the annual performances of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> given by members of the participating choirs. Her final appearance at the Leith Hill festival was in 1995, when she played Walter Leigh's concertino for harpsichord and strings in one of the evening concerts. She also became a friend of the Dolmetsch family, appearing regularly at the Haslemere festival from 1979 and as a tutor at the Dolmetsch summer schools.<br>
<br>Much loved by her wide circle of friends and colleagues, Ruth Dyson was very hard working and very professional. She died, of a heart attack, at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, on the final day of the 1997 Dolmetsch summer school, 16 August. Survived by her stepson and stepdaughter, she was buried at St Martin's Church, Dorking. She left her library and most of her instruments to the Royal College of Music.<br>
