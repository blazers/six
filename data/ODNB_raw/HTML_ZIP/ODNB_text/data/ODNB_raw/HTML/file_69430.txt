<span class="headword">Bassey,  Okon Asuguo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Hogan Bassey, Hogan Kid Bassey]</span>  (1932&#150;1998), <span class="occ">boxer and sports administrator</span>, was born in Creek Town, Calabar, Nigeria, on 3 June 1932, the eldest of five sons of Chief Asuquo Bassey. He was educated at Creek Town School, Calabar, and Ahmaddiya School, Olowogbowo, Lagos, and it was during this time that he first took up boxing. He turned professional at the age of sixteen and won his country's flyweight title in 1949 by outpointing Dick Turpin (not to be confused with the English boxer of the same name). He lost a rematch but outpointed Steve Jeffra in 1951 to win the bantamweight title.<br>
<br>Aided by Douglas Collister and Jack Fransworth, two Nigerian-based Englishmen with boxing contacts at home, Bassey left for Liverpool in 1952. Managed by Peter Banasko, a local former boxer and one of the few black British managers active at the time, Bassey made his British d&eacute;but in January 1952: a fourth-round knock-out of Ray Hillyard at Liverpool Stadium. Eighteen contests followed (with fourteen wins) in the year. Stocky and powerfully built, Bassey packed a knock-out punch in either hand but was also a technically gifted boxer. These skills, together with his pleasant demeanour, professionalism, and humility outside the ring, quickly endeared him to the British boxing public.<br>
<br>In February 1953 Bassey took a significant step up in class by meeting the former European bantamweight champion Luis Romero in Manchester. Bassey won by an eighth-round knock-out. Next was the highly rated Londoner Sammy McCarthy. Again Bassey won. A rare defeat followed, however, to Derry-born Billy &#145;Spider&#146; Kelly, in London. Seven wins from eight contests in 1954 were followed by five victories in 1955. In November 1955 Bassey was matched with Kelly for the empire featherweight title. Bassey was not expected to win the contest but, in a superlative display of skill and strength, he stopped Kelly in the eighth round. He left Peter Banasko for George Biddles after this contest. On 3 December 1955 he married Maria Williams (<i>b</i>. 1934/5), machinist, of Liverpool; she was the daughter of Benjamin Peter Williams.<br>
<br>After successfully defending his empire title in April 1957 Bassey next visited America, where he surprised many by his conclusive points victory over the world-class Puerto Rican Miguel Berrios. Two months later he was matched with the European champion, the French Algerian Cherif Hamia, for the vacant world featherweight title in Paris. Although he was knocked down in the second round, his non-stop style bewildered Hamia, and in the tenth round the referee stopped the contest in Bassey's favour. Bassey, the first Nigerian to hold a world boxing title, was duly made MBE, and in the process became the first Nigerian to hold such an honour.<br>
<br>Having relinquished the empire title to concentrate on his world crown, Bassey's first defence came in April 1958. Few expected him to beat the upcoming Mexican Ricardo Moreno in Los Angeles. Again, however, Bassey stunned the 20,000 partisan crowd, by knocking Moreno out in the third round. He also beat former world champion Willie Pep in a non-title bout in Boston. His second and last defence of his world featherweight title came against the talented American Davey Moore, and their clash in March 1959 in Los Angeles proved to be the toughest of his career. After a fierce contest lasting thirteen rounds, Biddles refused to send his fighter out for the fourteenth round; he explained later that owing to cuts Bassey could not see. The return match, in August 1959, ended in similar fashion at the end of the tenth round. Aged only twenty-seven, but knowing that his best years were behind him, Bassey sensibly chose to retire.<br>
<br>On his return to Nigeria, Bassey was appointed director of physical education and was given the job of coaching the Olympic boxing team. He wrote an instructional book, <span class="italic">Hogan on Boxing</span> (1963), before producing two Olympic medallists: Nojeem Mayegun (1964) and Isaac Ikhouria (1972). He was awarded the (Senegalese) Lion of Africa award in 1973, and Nigeria's highest honour, membership of the order of the Niger, in 1979. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, in 1977 he married Mary Magdalene. There were eight children of his two marriages.<br>
<br>As the first black African boxing champion since Battling Siki (Baye Phal) in the 1920s, Bassey enabled Nigerian boxing and sport to expand beyond both their own and Africa's borders at a time of increasing Western awareness of African culture. His influence long remained a force in his country of birth and he was at the end of the twentieth century voted the greatest Nigerian athlete of the century, above fellow boxer Dick Tiger (also Liverpool-based for a time), basketball player Hakeem Olajuwon, and footballer Christian Okoye. He died in the early hours of 26 January 1998 at his home in Apapa, Lagos.<br>
