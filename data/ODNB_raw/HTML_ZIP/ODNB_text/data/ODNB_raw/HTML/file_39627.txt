<span class="headword">Malory, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1439/40), <span class="occ">prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, came from a Warwickshire family: he was the brother or first or second cousin of John Malory of Newbold Revel, father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17899/', "Sir Thomas Malory")</script> the author.<br>
<br>He may be the Robert Malory, <i>clericus</i>, who was rector of Withybrook in Warwickshire in 1407&#150;8, a benefice he would have resigned before going to Rhodes for his noviciate, then of five years. He is first certainly recorded on 11 March 1415, as preceptor of Balsall and Grafton in Warwickshire, and by 18 July 1432 was acting as prior of England, although it was not until 4 May 1433 that the grand master in Rhodes formally appointed him to his priory (Clerkenwell) and its five preceptories, and gave him authority over the hospitaller priory of Ireland and the bailiwick of Scotland.<br>
<br>Malory took his seat in the upper house of the parliament of 1433, by virtue of his position as prior, and afterwards sat on two commissions for Middlesex, one to assess tax rebates, the other to administer an oath not to maintain peace-breakers. He spent 1434 settling into his priory. In addition to routine business, he reorganized its procedures so that the office of the dead should be properly said for deceased members and benefactors of the priory. He also made preparations to lead a contingent, including knights from Scotland, to Rhodes, where an attack from Egypt was expected.<br>
<br>Malory's passport was issued on 25 January 1435, but, although he was supposed to be in Rhodes by March, he was still in England in October. He was in Rhodes by 22 March 1436 and remained there until December 1437, but the danger from Egypt subsided, and his only known duties were more administrative than military. A long-established regulation allowed that once or twice every decade a deserving member of the order residing at headquarters should be granted an extra preceptory, and Malory was given one in Derbyshire, which he then exchanged for one in Yorkshire. He also persuaded the order to grant him his priory for life: it had originally been granted only for ten years. When about to leave he was chosen as one of a commission of three to inform the pope, who was in Florence, of the death of the grand master and the election of a successor. Malory took the opportunity while there to obtain papal confirmation of the life grant of his office.<br>
<br>Malory was back in England by June 1438, and was soon caught up again in the order's business and the king's, carrying out the numerous transactions over the holding of land and ecclesiastical office that went with his position, arranging a safe conduct to get the Scottish members of his party home, acting as trier of petitions for the Lords in the parliament of 1439&#150;40, and attending the great council. He successfully promoted a private bill in parliament to pursue his priory's interest in property destroyed in the peasants' revolt of 1381. He also saw to his own state and comfort by arranging the duty-free release of a cargo that his party had brought back from Rhodes, including not only armour, but also wine, silk, &#145;chamlet&#146;, and Turkey carpets. His last recorded act was a quittance for rent to one of his tenants, issued on 16 December 1439. He was dead by 10 May 1440, when Henry VI wrote to ask the grand master to confirm the election of Malory's successor.<br>
<br>After Malory's death a number of his kinsmen were working for the priory. That, like the Turkey carpets, suggests that his sense of vocation was not severely ascetic. He looks like a man at ease with himself, able to combine the ecclesiastical and the secular, to work capably with people of every rank, and to give everyone, living or dead, his due. If he ever gave anyone more, there is no record of it. When in Rhodes he sued the king in his own court of chancery by proxy for 8<i>d</i>., and won.<br>
