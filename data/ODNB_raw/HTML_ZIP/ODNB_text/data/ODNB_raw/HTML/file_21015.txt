<span class="headword">Owen, Sir  John</span>  (1600&#150;1666), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the eldest son of John Owen (<i>d</i>. 1613) of Clenennau, Caernarvonshire (who was himself the fourth son of Robert Owen of Bodsilin in the same county), who had made a fortune as secretary to the Elizabethan politician Sir Francis Walsingham. The elder John married Elin Maurice (<i>b</i>. 1578), heir to the Maurice estates in Caernarvonshire and Shropshire, which included Clenennau. Outliving two husbands, she became the senior member of the family on the death of her grandfather, Sir William Maurice, in 1622. When the younger John Owen inherited Clenennau on her death in 1626, he became one of the richest gentlemen in Caernarvonshire.<br>
<br>The paucity of local records in that part of Wales means that the dates of birth and death for John Owen are known only from his memorial in Penmorfa church (Caernarvonshire). Likewise, nothing is known of his youth and early manhood, save that he served as high sheriff of Caernarvonshire in 1630&#150;31 and of Merioneth the following year, and at some stage married Janet, daughter of Griffith Vaughan of Corsygedol, Merioneth. Letters suggest that it was a deeply affectionate union, and it produced several children. It is likely that the young Owen had some military experience, for otherwise it is hard to see why he should have been singled out in September 1642 to command the foot regiment to be raised in north-west Wales for the king's service at the outbreak of the civil war. The poverty of the region made the preparation of the unit slow work, and it did not join the royal army until the end of the year.<br>
<br>Thereafter the regiment joined all of that army's campaigns, and Owen led it with distinction, being wounded in the face at the storming of Bristol in July 1643 and serving as governor of Reading throughout the following winter. The regiment was eventually taken prisoner with most of the royal infantry at Naseby, but by then Owen had long been detached from it for more exalted duties. These commenced in the autumn of 1644, when a parliamentarian invasion of north-east Wales placed the whole principality under pressure. There was need for a tough and loyal soldier to secure the hinterland, and Owen was chosen for the job. On 10 December he was commissioned governor of Conwy and promoted to the rank of major-general with overall responsibility for forces in the three counties of north-west Wales; seven days later he was knighted to increase his social standing. On taking up his command, he set to work at once to bring in money to pay the local soldiery, and led a body of them to help repel an enemy thrust into Denbighshire in March 1645.<br>
<br>For the rest of that year Owen was as much concerned with local royalists as with parliamentarians, and in particular with John Williams, archbishop of York, who resided at Conwy Castle and had paid to repair it. Owen, a born zealot, felt an instinctual suspicion of Williams, an interfering and flexible politician, and tension between the two culminated when the former seized the castle on 14 May. Owen managed to repulse parliamentarian incursions into the region until April 1646, when a full-scale invasion began under Thomas Mytton, and Conwy was blockaded. On 8 August Mytton stormed the town, using information provided by Williams, but Owen hung on to the castle even after the king himself had given permission to surrender. He did not give up until 9 November, making it one of the last three royalist fortresses to capitulate.<br>
<br>Sir John now lived quietly on his estates, paying fines totalling &pound;4842 to a victorious parliament in 1647 and refusing an invitation that year from the exiled royalist general Prince Rupert to serve under him in the French army. Instead he joined the widespread royalist uprising of 1648, commanding the division of it in north-west Wales. Upon 3 June, following risings in the south of the country, Owen attacked Caernarfon with 240 supporters, driving Mytton's small garrison inside the walls and capturing the parliamentarian high sheriff, William Lloyd, who died of his wounds. Immediately he had to face a counter-attack by the troops occupying north-east Wales, led by colonels Carter and Twistleton. He met them at Llandyg&aacute;i on 5 June, and though his men routed the main body of their enemies, they broke in turn against the reserve. Owen himself was wounded, dragged from his horse, and made prisoner.<br>
<br>Despite an attempt to rescue him from Denbigh Castle, Owen was escorted to that of Windsor, and charged with treason by the parliament on 26 July. In November both houses voted to banish him, but in the harsher climate following Pride's Purge he was sent for trial with other royalist leaders. On 6 March 1649 he was sentenced to beheading, a large part of the feeling against him being owed to the belief that Lloyd's death had been caused by ill treatment in Owen's hands. Sir John appealed to the purged parliament for his life, and on 8 March it voted a reprieve by 28 voices to 23, Henry Ireton and Edmond Chaloner being especially prominent in his defence. Owen sent fulsome letters of gratitude and was subsequently pardoned, although &pound;1000 more had been exacted from his estate to compensate Lloyd's family.<br>
<br>After this it is hardly surprising that Owen retired into private life again for ten years, a period broken by spells of imprisonment in 1655 and 1658 as the protectorate put prominent royalists in preventive detention during times of political tension. In 1659, however, he joined Booth's rising, and attempted to raise north-west Wales again in support of that rising. He failed, and went into hiding when Booth was defeated, while his estates were seized again. He was saved this time by the fall of the republic, and the restoration of the monarchy. In November 1660 he turned the tables by petitioning the Convention Parliament for compensation for his sufferings and for punishment of those who had inflicted them. Neither request was met, but Charles II rewarded him for his many services with appointment to the office of vice-admiral for north Wales in January 1661. Owen held this throughout the uneventful remainder of his life; he died in 1666 at Clenennau and was interred at Penmorfa church.<br>
<br>Owen's political sympathies are hardly a matter of surprise, as north-west Wales was a solidly royalist region at the opening of the civil war, but his fidelity to them was most unusual. It is another mark of his conscientious and rigorous nature that he saved his working papers and correspondence from the war period, which today provide the single most important body of source material for events in this part of Wales during these years.<br>
