<span class="headword">Stuart,  John Ferdinand Smyth</span>  (1745&#150;1814), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, claimed to be descended through both parents from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24879/', "James Scott, the duke of Monmouth")</script>. According to his own doubtful statement, his father, Wentworth Smyth, was son of the duke and Lady Henrietta Maria, daughter of Thomas, Lord Wentworth. After Monmouth's execution, Wentworth Smyth is said to have been adopted by Colonel Smyth, Monmouth's aide-de-camp, who made him his heir. Wentworth Smyth took part in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, and was killed in the highlands at some later date. His reputed wife, Maria Julia Dalziel, who was said to be John Ferdinand's mother, was represented to be the granddaughter of General James Crofts, Monmouth's natural son.<br>
<br>John Ferdinand Smyth, who in 1793 adopted the name of Stuart, studied medicine at Edinburgh University. He then emigrated to America and settled near Williamsburg, Virginia, where he practised medicine. At the outbreak of the American War of Independence he was among the few loyalists in the area, and on 15 October 1775 he abandoned his home. He served in several loyalist regiments with the rank of captain, distinguishing himself, according to his own account, by his zeal and activity. He was taken prisoner on several occasions, and was once kept in irons for eighteen months. At the close of the war he moved to England with a compensatory pension of &pound;300 p.a. In 1784, on some insinuations secretly made against him to the commissioners for American claims, his income was suspended and never restored. Extreme poverty resulted in his accepting the position of barrack-master. He made strenuous representations to government, and in 1795 demanded justice from William Pitt peremptorily.<br>
<br>Smyth's <span class="italic">Tour in the United States of America</span> appeared in London in 1784. An account of his travels and military service in America, the work was well reviewed despite, or perhaps because of, his harsh critique of rural American society. Forever enchanted by the Jacobite cause, he also wrote <span class="italic">Destiny and Fortitude: an Heroic Poem on the Misfortunes of the House of Stuart</span> (1808), to which he attached his own family history.<br>
<br>In 1795 Smyth was persuaded to accompany Admiral Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian to the West Indies, where he was shipwrecked three times and was present at the capture of St Lucia. He later returned to England and was killed by a carriage at the corner of Southampton Street, London, on 20 December 1814. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter, details of whom are unknown.<br>
