<span class="headword">Green,  James</span>  (1771&#150;1834), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at Leytonstone in Essex on 13 March 1771, the son of John Green, builder, and his wife, Sarah. He was apprenticed to Thomas Martyn, a draughtsman of natural history, who resided at 10 Great Marlborough Street, London. When his apprenticeship expired, he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1791, where he attracted the notice of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and copied many of his pictures. In 1793 he exhibited at the Royal Academy several views of Tunbridge Wells, and some portraits. On 13 February 1805 Green married at St Marylebone, Marylebone Road, Marylebone, Middlesex, Mary Byrne [<a name="cosubject_40940"></a><span class="headword">Mary Green</span>  (1776&#150;1845)], second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4275/', "William Byrne (1743&#150;1805)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65026/', "Byrne family (per. 1765&#150;1849)")</script>], the landscape engraver. She was a pupil of (L. A.?) Arlaud, and was a well-known <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, exhibiting at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and the Society of British Artists from 1795 to 1845. She was a member of the Associated Artists in Water-Colours from 1807 to 1810, and letters by her relating to this society are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Her large miniature of Queen Adelaide, signed &#145;My Green&#146;, is in the Royal Collection. Foskett noted that &#145;she was a good artist who painted with freedom and placed her sitters well&#146;  (Foskett, 550).<br>
<br>Green gradually attained a good reputation for his portraits in watercolour. In 1804 he had belonged for four years to an informal sketching club that included the patron and landscape painter Sir George Beaumont, Samuel Shelley the miniature painter, &#145;Nattes and Hills drawing Masters and Pyne, a designer, who met weekly in each others' houses during the winter months to sketch and converse on art&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.2271). His execution was more elegant than powerful, but his portraits do not lack dignity. Many of them have been engraved, including those of Benjamin West, president of the Royal Academy (original painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and Sir R. Birnie, both engraved in mezzotint by W. Say; George Cook, the actor, as Iago (Garrick Club, London), engraved in mezzotint by James Ward; and Joseph Charles Horsley (&#145;the stolen child&#146;), engraved by R. Cooper. In the National Portrait Gallery, London, there are portraits by him of Thomas Stothard RA, William Say, Peter Nicholson, and Sir John Ross, the latter being Green's last work. The portrait of Stothard was sold at Samuel Rogers's sale in May 1856, as by George Henry Harlow, whose works Green's portraiture resembled at times although it is signed &#145;James Green, 1830&#146;. It was engraved by E. Scriven for the <span class="italic">Library of the Fine Arts</span> (April 1833). Green also painted large subject pictures in oil, including <span class="italic">Zadig and Astarte</span> (exh. RA, 1826, of which an engraving was reproduced in the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span>, 1828); <span class="italic">Bearnaise Woman and Canary</span>, engraved, and reproduced in the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span> (1827); and <span class="italic">Belinda</span>. His picture <span class="italic">The Loves Conducted by the Graces to the Temple of Hymen</span> was painted in watercolour. Green also was a frequent exhibitor from 1806 to 1832 at the British Institution, where he showed mainly genre and subject pictures, and in 1808 was awarded a premium of &pound;60. He was a member of the Associated Artists in Water-Colours. Many of his pictures were commissions, notably from Francis Chaplin of Riseholme, Lincolnshire. He resided for many years at Rathbone Place, London, and subsequently at 8 South Crescent, Bedford Square, London. He died at Bath on 27 March 1834. He was buried in Walcot church. On her husband's death Mary Green retired from her profession, though she continued to exhibit; she died on 22 October 1845, and was buried at Kensal Green, Middlesex. Her copies after Reynolds and Gainsborough were much valued. James and Mary Green had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11378/', "Benjamin Richard Green")</script> and a daughter.<br>
