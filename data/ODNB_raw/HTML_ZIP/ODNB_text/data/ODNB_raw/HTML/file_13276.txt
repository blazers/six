<span class="headword">Hill,  James</span>  (1697&#150;1727), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 7 February 1697 in the parish of St Nicholas, Hereford, the third son of John and Mary Hill. He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, and called to the bar as a member of the Middle Temple in 1721. In 1717 he issued proposals for publishing by subscription a history of the city of Hereford in two parts, one on its ecclesiastical and the other on its secular development, with &#145;transcripts from original records&#146;, &#145;geometrical plans of the city, churches, monasteries, and chapels&#146;, and engravings of monuments, arms, ancient seals, and portraits of eminent persons. He proposed to follow this, if successful, by another volume on the county, but the work was still unfinished at his death. In 1718 he was elected FSA, and on 30 April 1719 was admitted FRS. He showed to the Society of Antiquaries in the year of his election a &#145;vast collection of drawings, views, inscriptions, plans, and observations in MS, the fruits of his travels in the west of England that summer&#146;  (Gough, 1.410). One of his drawings, a west view and ichnography of Tintern Abbey, Monmouthshire, was engraved by J. Harris for John Stevens's <span class="italic">History of Antient Abbeys</span> (vol. 2, 1723, 57). When at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries on 3 January 1722 it was resolved to attempt a complete history of British coins, Hill undertook to describe the Saxon coins in Lord Oxford's possession, while his own collection was to be catalogued by George Holmes, the deputy keeper of the records in the Tower of London. During the same year he exhibited to the society an accurate survey of Ariconium (near Weston under Penyard) and of Hereford. He also composed poetry, &#145;a beautiful soliloquy &hellip; on hearing a parent correct his child with curses&#146;  (Gough, 1.418). A long narrative poem on Roman Britain was apparently not completed.<br>
<br>Hill was a friend of William Stukeley and Roger Gale, and, under the Celtic name Caradoc, a member of their Society of Roman Knights, which met to study Roman remains. By December 1725 he had acquired a house in Herefordshire, and although he told Stukeley he did not mean to leave London completely, lack of money apparently prevented him from returning. Early in 1727 he sent Stukeley his picture, in profile. He died in August that year, probably in Hereford, and was buried in Hereford Cathedral on 25 August. Verses on his death were published in John Husband's <span class="italic">Miscellany of Poems</span> (1731), from which it appears that Hill wrote some lines on &#145;Eternity&#146; about ten hours before his death.<br>
<br>At Hill's dying request his father in March 1728 sent his Herefordshire collections to Samuel Gale, who found that, although Hill had done more than was supposed, his work was &#145;a mere embryo of what he had promised&#146;  (<span class="italic">Family Memoirs</span>, 1.204&#150;5), and therefore unfit for publication. In 1752 Isaac Taylor of Ross bought the papers from Hill's brother, a schoolmaster in Herefordshire, for John Roberts MB, also of Ross, who indexed them and added a further ten volumes. After Roberts's death in 1776 the whole collection again passed to Taylor, who sold it in 1778 to Thomas Clarke FSA, principal registrar of the diocese of Hereford. On Clarke's death in March 1780 it came to the Revd James Clarke, who still owned it in 1821. Clarke offered to sell it to John Allen the younger of Hereford, who had repaired some of the volumes in 1818, but they could not agree about the price. By 1833 the collection belonged to Thomas Bird of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1836). It passed to Robert Biddulph Phillipps (<i>d</i>. 1864), who bequeathed it to Belmont Priory, near Hereford. It was later acquired by Hereford City Library. A collection of thirty-five ancient Herefordshire deeds, most of them marked with Hill's name, was given by Joshua Blew, librarian of the Inner Temple and a native of Herefordshire, to Andrew Colt&eacute;e Ducarel.<br>
