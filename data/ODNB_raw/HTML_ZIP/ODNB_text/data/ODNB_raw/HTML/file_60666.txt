<span class="headword">Griffiths,  Drew</span>  (1947&#150;1984), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre director</span>, was born on 17 January 1947 at 25 Caroline Street, Irlam, Urmston, Lancashire, the only child of Leonard Griffiths (1906&#150;1973) and his wife, Mona, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1910&#150;1973). While Methodism was the paternal tradition, Griffiths was brought up within the Church of England. In early adulthood he became an atheist, convinced that no God would tolerate so much human suffering, yet he always retained a sense of the spiritual and the transcendent. In 1953 the family moved a short distance to run the Coach and Horses pub in Liverpool Street, Cadishead. Mona drank to excess and Leonard had little time for his son, who hated pub life and often escaped to the back room to talk with his maternal aunt, Ruby Smythe; she became a substitute parent and his constant mainstay. Leaving Urmston grammar school at eighteen, Griffiths took up office work and then became letters editor for <span class="italic">Reveille</span> in Dundee. His first work in the theatre was as a student assistant stage manager at Dundee Repertory, which funded his first two years at the Birmingham School for Speech Training and Dramatic Art, where he assumed a comic &#145;refined&#146; Manchester accent. He subsequently took a postgraduate course in acting at Manchester Polytechnic's Stables Theatre.<br>
<br>In 1973 Griffiths moved to London, where he set up a home in Balham with Alan Pope, Gordon MacDonald&#151;friends from Birmingham&#151;and Philip Howells. In the following year they helped to found the Gay Sweatshop theatre company, intended as a showcase for drama which grew out of their sense of alienation as a result of being both homosexual and working-class. It was run as a collective, and Griffiths was involved in all its activities: writing, acting, and directing. His two principal plays were <span class="italic">Mister X</span> (1975), written with Roger Baker, and <span class="italic">As Time Goes by</span> (1977), written with No&euml;l Greig. The former grew out of improvisations in the Balham household and provided Griffiths with a platform from which to express his rage about homophobia, self-oppression, and his childhood (he was apparently subjected to aversion therapy at fourteen). The latter depicted three critical moments in the fashioning of a politicized gay identity&#151;England at the time of Oscar Wilde's trial for homosexuality in 1896; Berlin under the Nazis in 1929; and New York on the eve of the Stonewall riots in 1969. Frankly populist, these early shows gained from Griffiths's common touch as a performer&#151;a commitment to both show business aesthetics (which he thought inseparable from the gay sensibility) and intense emotional honesty. <span class="italic">As Time Goes by</span>, however, was evidence of his historical understanding and dramaturgical craftsmanship, and he was responsible for guiding the company into a new and more literary direction. Griffiths was also instrumental in getting women to join Sweatshop in 1975, although this lasted only a year; he was saddened when the collective divided into two separate companies in 1976.<br>
<br>Running a homosexual theatre company in the mid-1970s was a reckless enterprise for these working-class actors and directors since there was a risk they would not be offered other work. Yet, despite an inner fragility, Griffiths liked risk: he was a heavy drinker and smoker, treated shoplifting as a minor hobby, and aggressively affected a theatrically glamorous off-stage appearance that sometimes provoked hostile reactions. During a nine-month tour of <span class="italic">As Time Goes by</span> (August 1977 to May 1978), he contracted hepatitis B in Ireland. He was sent back to England and hospitalized, and in his absence the men's company underwent a crisis, largely the result of exhaustion, which led to a split. Griffiths felt that had he remained with the company he might have prevented this.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Griffiths and Greig set about developing the material about Edward Carpenter they had used in <span class="italic">As Time Goes by</span> for a new play. Their ideas differed radically, however, and it was Greig who finally wrote <span class="italic">The Dear Love of Comrades</span> (1979). Griffiths's driving Blakean perspective on the project seems to have been one part of a rapidly developing psychosis, possibly the result of his post-viral condition. He went haywire at an open-microphone show at London's Drill Hall theatre, began buying clothes obsessively, and travelled to the Sorbonne to become a beggar. He appeared to be in his own world, a place of euphoria and excitement, and he became angry when friends tried to intervene. His behaviour became so erratic that he was eventually expelled from the collective and felt thoroughly betrayed.<br>
<br>A slight, quietly spoken man, plagued by self-doubt, Griffiths always seemed vulnerable, but he gradually recovered, found acting work elsewhere, and then resumed a media career that had begun in Birmingham. His writing for radio and television, sparse in style and based on closely observed dialogue, is less well known and influential than his theatre work, but arguably as successful in absolute terms, and it constitutes a second career. <span class="italic">Something for the Boys</span> (Scottish Television) was set in a gay club during the Second World War and the radio play <span class="italic">South of the River</span> (Capital Playhouse series, 1981), was about an attempt, foiled by homophobia, to hold a weekly gay disco in a Balham pub. Griffiths had also worked (at loggerheads) with Greig on <span class="italic">Only Connect</span>, a play about Carpenter for a BBC Pebble Mill series, <span class="italic">The Other Side</span> (1979). The stress of writing a daily soap opera, <span class="italic">Nicola Johnson</span>, for Capital Radio during 1983 may have contributed to Griffiths's second illness, which came on swiftly. He was admitted to hospital after jumping from a moving train. Hating the medication he was offered, he simulated recovery in order to get discharged. He forced MacDonald, his sole remaining flatmate, to leave by placing a knife in his bed, became sexually rampant, and grew obsessed by the occult. After he set the flat on fire, friends unsuccessfully attempted to get him assigned to a psychiatric social worker; then, in desperation, they tried to get him sectioned. This too failed. He stopped paying rent, burned furniture in the garden, drank all day, and hardly slept.<br>
<br>Griffiths was murdered on 18 June 1984 at 140 Lyham Road, Brixton, London, after taking home a man he had picked up on a drinking spree in the Elephant and Castle. He had been seen flashing large wads of money about, and when he was eventually found, naked and stabbed through the heart, the cash was gone. Shortly before his death he told people he was writing a play about a rent boy who gets murdered. He was also talking about Jean Genet and William Burrough's <span class="italic">Naked Lunch</span>, remarking that the greatest orgasm comes with dying. In retrospect it might be thought that in his self-destructive behaviour he was looking for his &#145;angel of death&#146;. His funeral at Putney Vale crematorium on 23 July 1984 was for its time a remarkable affair, an emphatic demonstration of lesbian and gay pride and community, and a celebration of Griffiths's contribution to bringing these things about. He was recalled as compassionate, easy-going, and caring, as someone loved by all who met him, even though he could never bring himself to believe this.<br>
<br>Griffiths established Gay Sweatshop as the prime artistic expression of a politicized lesbian and gay identity. His personal and creative life reflects poignantly the larger social process, and to some extent the social pressures upon him&#151;particularly the pressures of homophobia. In a short period Drew Griffiths produced a body of work&#151;as writer, actor, and director&#151;that was marked by an intense honesty and considerable bravery.<br>
