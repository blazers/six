<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hughes,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1816&#150;1889), <span class="occ">ironmaster and engineer</span>, was born at Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, the son of John Hughes, engineer. Although his family origins are obscure, his father was employed at the Cyfarthfa ironworks in Merthyr Tudful and, later, at the Victoria works in Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire. According to tradition, Hughes joined his father, learning his trade at both works. By the early 1840s he held a senior position at the Uskside engineering works at Newport.<br>
<br>The Uskside works had grown from a small smithy in 1827 into a foundry specializing in ships' equipment such as anchors and chains. Hughes is variously described as proprietor, manager, and director of the works. Whatever his position, his time at Uskside was actively spent in consolidating both his personal and professional life. On 27 October 1844, at St Paul's Church, St Woolos, Newport, Monmouthshire, Hughes married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of William Lewis. His wife's family were associated with the Tredegar Arms, adjoining the Uskside foundry and supplying its workers with beer. John and Elizabeth Hughes lived at 36 Church Street, near the works. Their eight children, six boys and two girls, were all born at home in Newport between 1846 and 1858. During the same period, Hughes developed the Uskside works, and patented a number of inventions in armaments and armour plating.<br>
<br>In 1859 the family moved to London. Through his marine engineering and armament experience Hughes obtained a senior position with the Millwall Engineering and Shipbuilding Company on Thameside, and later he became a director of the company. The firm won the British Admiralty's 1864 trials of armour plating for &#145;iron-clads&#146; with the Millwall shield, and John Hughes's reputation was secured. It was this that attracted the attention of the Russian government. Hughes was invited to St Petersburg to discuss the possibility of plating the naval fortress at Kronstadt. The negotiations soon developed into a proposal that Hughes should establish a metallurgical plant somewhere in Russia. Geological surveys had already indicated the mineral riches of the Donbass coal basin in southern Ukraine. Although previous attempts at industrial development in the area had not met with success, Hughes decided, after a tour of inspection, to take up the challenge. He bought a concession for building a full-cycle metallurgical plant and rail-producing factory based on local Donbass materials from Prince Sergey Kochubey, and negotiated for land, mineral rights, and contracts. Hughes signed a formal agreement with the Russian government in 1868, and the New Russia Company Limited was registered in London on 3 July 1869, with a capital of &pound;300,000. Hughes's professional prestige attracted a number of prominent industrialists, including Sir Daniel Gooch, Thomas Brassey, father and son, and Joseph Whitworth, whose names among his seventeen original shareholders helped to raise the necessary capital for his enterprise.<br>
<br>The site Hughes had chosen for the factory lay on the open steppe, about 75 kilometres north of the nearest port. All the equipment needed to establish an ironworks had to be hauled by bullocks across the steppe from Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov. In the summer of 1870 Hughes arrived with about a hundred specialist ironworkers and miners, mostly recruited from the industrial valleys of south Wales. Within eight months, on 24 April 1871, the first blast furnace had been commissioned, despite an unusually severe winter and a cholera epidemic. Regular production of iron began in January 1872. The Russian government provided initial subsidies and relaxed import duties, although minimum production levels and commencement dates had been set for the mines and furnaces. Hughes and his men overcame the early difficulties, and by 1880 were able to produce daily the agreed weekly quota of iron. The surrounding area was able to provide the works with all the necessary raw materials except specialized labour. Hughes therefore imported a small core of expert workers from south Wales, but local labourers were also recruited and trained; nevertheless, the company continued to employ British workers in senior positions until 1917. The company's works were known familiarly by the name of the founder, a testament to his forceful personality. The &#145;Hughes factory&#146; gave its name to the settlement which grew up in its shadow. Hughes and his family lived in Hughesovka (Yuzovka) from 1870; four of his sons helped to establish and run the works, and a number of his grandchildren were born in the town.<br>
<br>A contemporary account describes John Hughes as &#145;an open-faced, clear-eyed, bluff and handsome man, with laughter as well as command in the tones of his voice&#146;  (obituary, quoted in Bowen). He was an industrial entrepreneur of the old school with a firm belief in the values of hard work, honesty, and hands-on management. He shared his workers' discomforts during the first winter at the site, and later is described visiting their homes to celebrate a wedding or to greet a new baby. In 1879 Hughes wrote from London to the minister of domains expressing his fears that an outbreak of plague could spread to Hughesovka: &#145;I have impressed on the workmen in our employ to abstain from drinking vodka &hellip; and also to avoid eating a large amount of cucumbers and melons and especially unripe fruit&#146;  (Central State Historical Archives, St Petersburg, F.37, op.53, d.746, p.297). He established hospitals, a fire brigade, and a police force in his town and took a personal interest in the health and general behaviour of his workforce.<br>
<br>John Hughes died on 29 June 1889 of a stroke while on business in St Petersburg. His body was returned to London for interment, beside his wife, in the family plot at Norwood cemetery. The town and the works which bore his name continued to expand under his sons' leadership, becoming one of the largest industrial enterprises in the Russian empire, until by 1917 the registered capital of the New Russia Company stood at &pound;2.5 million. After the revolution of that year the majority of the company's foreign employees left the country, although the works survived and prospered under new management and a new name. The town of Hughesovka became Stalino in 1924, and adopted the name Donetsk in 1961. It remained one of the largest industrial centres in Ukraine. The New Russia Company was formally liquidated in 1970.<br>
<br>When he founded the New Russia Company, Hughes was a successful businessman in his fifties. In contrast to most foreign industrialists in Russia he cut his links with his British business interests and established his home in his adopted country. The likelihood of large profits was undoubtedly a major motivation, together with the technological challenge presented by building a new industry from the ground. His cautious, sure development of the company and paternalistic concern for his workers suggest a longer-term commitment to the creation of a stable industrial base in the Donbass, and a dynastic vision for the town which bore his name.<br>
