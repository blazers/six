<span class="headword">Ashby,  George</span>  (1724&#150;1808), <span class="occ">antiquary and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell, London, on 5 December 1724, the son of Edmund Ashby (1690&#150;1775), merchant tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth Judith, daughter of Robert Lock of Dinton, Wiltshire. He was educated at Croydon at a school kept by a Mr Mills and at Westminster School (1737&#150;40), and was elected to a place at Eton College in 1739 but did not take it up. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in November 1740 and proceeded to the degrees of BA in 1744, MA in 1748, the year of his election to a college fellowship on 29 March, and BD in 1756. He was ordained deacon in December 1746 and priest in 1752, and licensed to the curacy of Halesworth and Chediston, Suffolk. Ashby later held other preferments including two family livings in his native county of Leicestershire at Twyford with Hungarton; he gave up Twyford in 1766 and Hungarton in 1769. He resided in college and held several offices, of which the most important were steward (1766&#150;7) and president or vice-master of St John's from January 1767, a position he held until March 1775. Thereafter he had little to do with Cambridge, surrendering his fellowship, which was filled up again in March 1776, perhaps on account of a change of mastership in the college and some involvement in an abortive scheme to remove the legal requirement of celibacy from Cambridge fellows. In July 1774 he had taken the college living of Barrow in Suffolk and in 1780 his patron John Ross, bishop of Exeter, added an Oxfordshire parish which he exchanged after irksome delay for the rectory of Stansfield in Suffolk. He then held Barrow and Stansfield until his death. &#145;I move very little, being perfectly happy at home&#146;, he wrote in May 1791  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.684).<br>
<br>Ashby was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1775 and William Cole wrote to salute him as a brother antiquary and express his &#145;raptures at the genuine antiquarian minutiae in your papers&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5847, fol. 397). A year later Cole was to describe him as &#145;a very able scholar, and lively and talkative to a degree; but immensely vain and fond of admiration&#146;; he surprised everyone at Cambridge by casting off his wig and appearing in &#145;natural grey locks&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5821, fol. 82). As an antidote to grief Ashby urged Cole to follow his own example: &#145;I always fall to reading and writing harder than ever and never fail to find the benefit of thus giving a turn another way to my thoughts&#146;  (ibid., fol. 83). His fellow antiquary Michael Tyson, who had a much lower opinion of Ashby's attainments than Cole, nevertheless found him &#145;as entertaining a companion as any can be&#146;, with an extraordinary memory  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.658).<br>
<br>Although he published little on his own account beyond contributions to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and an essay on a coin of Nerva found at Colchester  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 3, 165), Ashby had a wide circle of friends and correspondents, including Thomas Gray, Richard Gough, Bishop Thomas Percy, Craven Ord, Thomas Pennant, and James Granger, to whom he supplied useful information on various topics. John Nichols was indebted to him for notes printed over the whimsical initials T. F. (that is, Taylor's friend) in <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</span> and for a long account of the Roman military at Leicester incorporated in Nichols's vast <span class="italic">History of Leicestershire</span> (1. cix&#150;clvii). He also helped Daines Barrington in his <span class="italic">Observations on the Statutes</span> (1775) and Thomas Hanmer in his <span class="italic">Observations on Scripture</span>. Nichols repaid him by including an account of Ashby with parts of his correspondence in his <span class="italic">Illustrations of Literature</span>, and much of the rest survives with his manuscript collections in the British Library, the Bodleian, Suffolk Record Office, and elsewhere. He had very catholic tastes and made notes on old plays, ornithology, coins, literature, topography, and genealogy among many other subjects.<br>
<br>Ashby's sight failed in 1793 and he became quite blind. He died after repeated strokes of paralysis at Barrow on 12 June 1808 and was buried in his church at Barrow where there is a monument to him and his youngest sister, Hannah, with whom he had lived and whom he survived by barely a month. He never married. His constant companion and amanuensis from about 1780, one Thomas Lyus of Barrow, inherited his library, but it was soon sold to a bookseller at Bury St Edmunds and dispersed by sale with his maps and prints. Despite this scattering of materials Ashby deserves to be more than a footnote in the lives of others and his contribution to antiquarian studies has never been examined fully.<br>
