<span class="headword">Walker,  Thomas</span>  (1822&#150;1898), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 5 February 1822, at Marefair, Northampton. His parents sent him to a local school at the age of six where he remained until he was ten. His father had died when he was young, and his mother accepted the offer of relatives at Oxford to take charge of him. He was apprenticed to a carpenter and, when his apprenticeship was completed, began in business. However, he found carpentry uncongenial and abandoned his trade at twenty-four, determined instead to become a journalist. Walker had already begun his lifelong pursuit of learning by an exhaustive programme of reading. He followed his self-imposed task with much earnestness, teaching himself German so that he could read Kant in the original. To be better equipped for a career in journalism he also taught himself shorthand.<br>
<br>Walker moved to London and in September 1846 advertised for a position in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, but without success. He was in danger of starving to death in the street when he chanced upon the surgery of Frederick Knight Hunt, who offered Walker casual employment. Hunt was impressed by the younger man's willingness to undertake with enthusiasm the humblest task. By a combination of good fortune and diligence, Walker eventually realized his ambition and established himself as a journalist. T. P. Healey, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Medical Times</span>, engaged him as a reporter; he also contributed to <span class="italic">Eliza Cook's Journal</span>. But the most important factor was Hunt's becoming assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. At first Walker made occasional contributions to the paper and then he obtained a junior post on the editorial staff. He served as the foreign sub-editor's general factotum, providing him with translations and pr&eacute;cis of articles in European and South American journals. In 1851 Walker was promoted to foreign and general sub-editor. The <span class="italic">Daily News</span> now entered into a period of increasing success, first under the editorship of Walker's mentor, Hunt, and, after his death in 1854, under William Weir. When Weir died in 1858, Walker was appointed the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>'s political editor, with John Robinson as managing editor. This proved to be a most successful partnership.<br>
<br>This rapid change in Walker's fortunes did not change his demeanour. He remained austere and was never known to make a joke. In domestic affairs, he declared his intention that the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> would pursue a &#145;perfectly independent course&#146;. Lord John Russell's new administration was afforded &#145;a fair trial&#146;, and its performance judged with generosity. In foreign politics he was a steadfast friend to the cause of Italian liberty, while in the American Civil War, much influenced by Harriet Martineau, he sturdily supported the northern states. However, what above all else set the tone of Walker's editorship was his unflagging devotion to Gladstone. When, in 1869, failing health obliged Walker to resign the editorship of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, Gladstone rewarded his loyalty by giving him charge of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. This much less onerous position Walker held for twenty years until July 1889. Despite his uncertain health and other duties, Walker's respect and admiration for Gladstone determined that he should return temporarily to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> at the time of the Turkish Bulgarian outrages, to guide the news reporting and editorial comment.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic churchman, Walker served as president of the London branch of the Congregational church. He devoted his retirement years to philanthropic works for his church. He married twice and was survived by one daughter. He died on 16 February 1898 at his house, 53 Addison Road, Kensington, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. Political candour distinguished Walker as an editor. T. P. O'Connor described him as &#145;very brilliant&#146; but discerned a marked cynicism  (Koss, 1.96). T. H. S. Escott thought him &#145;blameless and rather colourless&#146;  (p. 214). All were agreed on Walker's devotion to Gladstone. Frederick Greenwood generously acknowledged in his <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> that Walker &#145;always held aloof from partisan excess [and was] at all times anxious to do justice to opponents&#151;not common merits&#146;. All men were equally in awe of Walker's vast store of knowledge to which, over the years, he added judgement that grew ever more formidable and statesmanlike.<br>
