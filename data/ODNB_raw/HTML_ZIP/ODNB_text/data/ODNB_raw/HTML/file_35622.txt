<span class="headword">Propert,  John Lumsden</span>  (1834&#150;1902), <span class="occ">physician and art critic</span>, was born on 9 April 1834, the son of John Propert (1792&#150;1867), surgeon, and his wife, Juliana Ross. His father founded in 1855 the Royal Medical Benevolent College, Epsom, and served as its treasurer. Propert was educated at Marlborough College (August 1843 &#150; December 1847), and at King's College Hospital. He obtained the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the licence of the Society of Apothecaries in 1855, and in 1857 he graduated MB with honours in medicine at the University of London. He then joined his father in general practice in New Cavendish Street, London, and became highly successful. On 21 April 1864 he married Mary Jessica (<i>bap</i>. 1835), daughter of William and Caroline Hughes of Worcester, with whom he had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Propert was widely known in artistic circles as a good etcher. He favoured landscapes, particularly river or marine views, and exhibited his work frequently at the Royal Academy from 1870 to 1882. Later in life he also took up landscape painting in oils. He was a connoisseur, as well as a practitioner, of art in the broadest sense, and his home, 112 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, was filled with beautiful specimens of Wedgwood, bronzes, and jewelled work. His deepest fascination was reserved for portrait miniatures and he accrued one of the most significant private collections of miniatures in existence in the late nineteenth century. A contemporary, G. C. Williamson, doubted that there had ever been: &#145;a private collection so numerous in examples of the finest work of each of the great masters&#146;  (Williamson, <span class="italic">Portrait Miniatures</span>, 2.141) and it was certainly an exceptional, balanced collection containing many signed examples of work by miniaturists of the first order. Today miniatures with a Propert provenance grace collections such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (Nicholas Hilliard, <span class="italic">Mrs Holland</span>), the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (Samuel Cooper, <span class="italic">Robert Lilburne</span>), and the Huntington Library and Art Collections, San Marino (Andrew Plimer, <span class="italic">The Three Graces</span>). A privately printed catalogue was issued prior to the collection's dispersal, following an exhibition at the Fine Art Society, London, in May 1897.<br>
<br>It was, however, as a scholar rather than a collector that Propert made his greatest contribution to the subject. His <span class="italic">History of Miniature Art with Notes on Collectors and Collections</span> (1887) presented the public with the first scholarly and comprehensive treatment of the history of portrait miniatures, setting their development in England in the early sixteenth century in the context of early illuminated manuscripts. He also compiled in 1889 the catalogue of the <span class="roman">Exhibition of Portrait Miniatures</span> at the Burlington Fine Arts Club. Propert died from pneumonia at his home, 112 Gloucester Place, London, on 7 March 1902 and was buried at Brookwood cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
