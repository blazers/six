<span class="headword">Chirwa,  Orton Edgar Ching'oli</span>  (1919&#150;1992), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Nyasaland and Malawi</span>, was born near Nkhata Bay, Nyasaland, the son of Yesaya Mafananiso Chirwa (1881&#150;1955) and Maggie Nyamazawo Nyrenda (<i>fl</i>. 1880&#150;1960), both of whom had been seized as children in the last period of Ngoni raiding and brought up in the village of Chief Mtwalo. As young adults they had become Christians and moved back to Nkhata Bay, where they married. Soon after Chirwa's birth the family moved to work at the Livingstonia Mission at Lubwa, Northern Rhodesia. There he went to school before returning to Nyasaland to be trained as a teacher at Bandawe in 1934. He taught for a time in the Nkhata Bay area and in 1941 married Mesinayi Mhone (<i>b</i>. 1921), a local girl. He then went to work as a clerk in Ndola in the copperbelt and saved money in order to go to St Francis College in Natal, where he gained university entrance qualifications. In 1947 he went to Fort Hare and graduated BA in 1951. By this time his marriage to Mesinayi Mhone had ended. He returned to Nyasaland and was appointed a lecturer in sociology at Domasi Teacher Training College. On 5 November 1951 he married Vera Chirwa (<i>b</i>. 1932), who shared the same clan name. In 1955 he went to study for the English bar at Lincoln's Inn, and in 1958 he returned to Nyasaland as the protectorate's first African barrister.<br>
<br>Chirwa had taken an active part in the initial, very vigorous opposition to the federation of Nyasaland with the Rhodesias imposed by Britain in the form of the Central African Federation in 1953. When this campaign failed Chirwa attempted to organize an alternative party to the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) as a channel for African political activity, but his plans came to nothing. By 1958 the NAC had been reinvigorated by a group of well-educated young men and was again challenging the legitimacy of the federation. Aware of the handicap they suffered in the eyes of village people because of their youth, they called back from the Gold Coast (where he was practising as a doctor) a veteran nationalist, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, to lead the movement. Chirwa had known Banda for some time, so, on Banda's return to Nyasaland in 1958 it was an obvious step for Chirwa to become legal adviser to the NAC.<br>
<br>When in March 1959 a state of emergency was declared in Nyasaland, Chirwa was one of more than 1000 people imprisoned. Banda and a few other leaders, Chirwa among them, were held in Southern Rhodesia, the rest in Nyasaland. Chirwa was released before any of the other leaders. It appeared that the British thought that he might provide a more moderate alternative to Banda. Chirwa, however, immediately accepted leadership of the newly created Malawi Congress Party (MCP), explicitly a continuation of the banned NAC. Invited to London, he made clear that there could be no negotiations until Banda was released. When this occurred, in April 1960, the other young leaders remained in detention for six more months. Banda took over the MCP and began to make it his own. Chirwa remained in the background until after the other young leaders were released late in September. At that time he arranged for Vera to study law in London. When internal self-government was achieved for Nyasaland in 1963, secession from the federation and independence were clearly the next aim.<br>
<br>In December 1963 Nyasaland left the Central African Federation, and in July 1964 it became an independent state within the Commonwealth (as Malawi). Chirwa became the independent country's first attorney-general. Nevertheless he, along with the other young members of the cabinet, was becoming increasingly uneasy over Banda's growing authoritarianism, and he played a leading part in the attempts to persuade Banda to change, which led to the so-called cabinet crisis of September 1964. All the ministers who had shared the experience of prison in Southern Rhodesia either were dismissed or resigned in sympathy with their friends. Chirwa tried to restore relations with Banda, but after twice being beaten by Banda's bodyguards he gave up and joined the many exiles in Dar es Salaam. There he became president of the Malawi Freedom Movement, a not very effective political party in exile. After Vera Chirwa was appointed a lecturer in law at the University of Zambia the family joined her in Lusaka. On Christmas eve 1981 Orton Chirwa, Vera, and their son Fumbani were abducted by Malawi police from a Zambian village close to the border with Malawi. In 1983 Chirwa and his wife were eventually brought to trial, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death, sentences that Banda later commuted to life imprisonment. On 19 October 1992 Chirwa died in Zomba prison, where, despite his age and ill health, he had often been held in solitary confinement while manacled to an iron bar in his cell. At the time it was rumoured that he had been murdered, but the evidence is inconclusive. He was buried at Nkhata Bay on 22 October. He was survived by his wife Vera, who was not allowed leave to go to her husband's funeral, which the Livingstonia synod transformed into that of a martyr, one of the signs of the beginning of the end of the Banda regime. She was eventually released three months later, and went on to found the Malawi Centre for Advice, Research, and Education on Rights, and to contest the presidential election in 2004.<br>
