<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brodum,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1767&#150;1824), <span class="occ">quack</span>, claimed to have been born in Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Germany, the son of Abraham and Caroline Brodum. This was thrown into doubt in 1805 by an article in the <span class="italic">Medical and Physical Journal</span> which stated that his real name was, in fact, Issachar Cohen, that he had been born in Copenhagen, and that he had made his living by selling ribbons on the street before arriving in London at the age of twenty. After working for a time as a street seller on Tower Hill, in 1787 he began an association with a Dr Lamert, a purveyor of patent medicines, who employed him to do odd jobs. It was alleged that Cohen then adopted the name of Williams, and he was credited by Lamert as &#145;a smart active youth, very loquacious, and of sonorous lungs&#146;  (Ietros, 67), and sent by him to Kent to sell his &#145;Switzer's balsam&#146; and other remedies. John Corry's <span class="italic">Detection of Quackery</span> (1802) gives an entirely different account of the start of Brodum's career and states that he attended Dr Bossy, another huckster of medicines, &#145;in the quality of a footman&#146; when he toured England. Corry also quotes a statement by Brodum in his <span class="italic">Guide to Old Age</span> that &#145;There is no other person of the name of Brodum in England&#146;. He probably made the name up, possibly as a Latinized version of the Polish Jewish surname Broda. On 15 January 1791 he was awarded an MD degree by Marischal College, Aberdeen, on the recommendation of doctors Saunders and Leo. Marischal College required no examination, and, providing the college's fees were paid, the recommendation of two doctors of medicine was deemed sufficient.<br>
<br>In 1795 Brodum published his <span class="italic">Guide to Old Age, or, A Cure for the Indiscretions of Youth</span>, in two volumes, dedicated to George III. This booklet was a puff for his two preparations: the nervous cordial, which he recommended for consumption, debility, and menstrual problems; and the botanical syrup, which he claimed would cure scurvy, scrofula, leprosy, cancer, and venereal disease. It could also be mixed with white lead and olive oil and painted on scrofulous skin. Both preparations were sold in bottles of various sizes for 5<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>., 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., or &pound;1 2<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. and could be bought from agents in Philadelphia and the English provinces or from Brodum's house at 9 Albany Street, Blackfriars Road, London. His claims were supported by many testimonials from named persons and by a copy of his doctoral diploma from Marischal College. The book went into four editions, each with a freshly engraved portrait of its author. It also claimed to have been translated into Italian, French, and Spanish.<br>
<br>Brodum was then summoned before the president and censors of the Royal College of Physicians for practising medicine without their licence. He claimed that he was merely selling medicines for which he held a royal patent. The president said that the college had no objection to that, but he should not accept consultation fees and must remove the brass plate from his house which described him as Dr Brodum. He refused to do so, pointing out that he held a doctorate in medicine from Marischal College, which he had purchased with a recommendation from a member of their college. The college of physicians took no further action. The medical faculty of Marischal College sought counsel's opinion as to whether they could cancel his doctoral degree, because of his notorious and impudent quackery and the immoral tendency of many passages in his various publications. Solicitor-General Blair advised them that they had no power to do so and pointedly suggested that they should make &#145;the case of Dr Brodum a lesson of caution and circumspection to themselves for the future in the bestowing of Academical honours&#146;  (Anderson, 2.133&#150;4).<br>
<br>Because Brodum was rich and a doctor of medicine, in 1798 he was elected a steward for a fund-raising banquet organized by Abraham Goldsmid to establish a free school for the education of the children of the Jewish poor. Then Goldsmid discovered that on 28 June 1798 Brodum had been naturalized, for which he had professed his adherence to the protestant religion. Since he had thus publicly renounced Judaism, he was dismissed from office in this Jewish charity. Brodum then sold his pharmaceutical business to one Anthony Daffy Swinton, with whom he was caricatured in 1811.<br>
<br>When Brodum made his will in 1824, he styled himself De Brodum and was living at 21 Great Coram Street, London. He left money to four charities in Copenhagen, where he owned property, as well as to the Westminster Hospital and to the Foundling Hospital, London. He and his wife, Cecilia, had no surviving children and his heirs were nephews and great-nephews in Copenhagen and Hamburg. In his will he complains that a promise made by the prime minister of Denmark, Count Moltke, to confer certain honours on him had not been confirmed by the king of Denmark. He therefore revoked an undertaking he had made to leave his estate in Denmark to six Danish charities, three to be nominated by the king and three by himself. However, the &#145;De&#146; suggests that he had acquired noble status there.<br>
<br>Brodum's <span class="italic">Guide to Old Age</span> is a shameless marketing exercise. It shows that Brodum was aware of the discovery that orange or lemon juice cured scurvy, and it is probable that his botanical syrup contained some fruit juice. It<blockquote>was chiefly the old formula of the decoction of woods, consisting of sassafras, guaiacum, and a few other articles, which he procured from Mr Chamberlin, an eminent chemist in Fleet Street. The decoction [was] well edulcorated with sugar of molasses. (Ietros, 71)</blockquote>Nothing else in the book suggests any knowledge of medicine. His other publications were <span class="italic">By his Majesty's Royal Letters Patent: Dr Brodum's Nervous Cordial, and Botanical Syrup</span> (1808) and <span class="italic">A Medical Essay on the Nature, Cause, and Cure of Coughs</span> (1814).<br>
