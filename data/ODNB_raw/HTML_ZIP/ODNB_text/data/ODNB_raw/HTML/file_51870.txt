<span class="headword">Estorick,  Eric Elihu</span>  (1913&#150;1993), <span class="occ">art collector and dealer</span>, was born Elihu Estorick on 13 February 1913 in Brooklyn, New York, the only child of Morris Estorick (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1979), paint manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cutler (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1969). His parents were Jewish, and had emigrated from Russia in 1905. He was educated at James Madison High School, New York, and from 1930 at Washington Square College, New York University, graduating in 1937. It was at the Gallery of Living Art in Washington Square College, a collection created by Albert Gallatin, that Estorick first discovered modern European art. From 1935 he worked as a research secretary for Waldo Frank, the prominent left-wing novelist and political commentator, and after completing an MA in sociology at the New York University School for Social Research in 1938, he taught sociology at New York University from 1939 to 1941. He published <span class="italic">Stafford Cripps: Prophetic Rebel</span> in 1941. During the Second World War he worked in Canada and England for the foreign broadcast intelligence service of the United States government, becoming head of the British empire division, and in 1943 wrote the first of several introductions to a series of books by Commonwealth leaders which appeared during the 1940s.<br>
<br>Estorick settled in London in 1947 after his marriage on 12 October that year to Salome Dessau (1920&#150;1989), textile designer and daughter of Henry Dessau, a Nottingham textile manufacturer who had left Leipzig in 1932. They had one son and one daughter. He published a second biography of Cripps, <span class="italic">Stafford Cripps: Master Statesman</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">Changing Empire: Churchill to Nehru</span> (1950), a history of the evolution of the British empire into the Commonwealth, becoming closely involved in Labour Party politics. From 1950 to 1953 he worked as archivist for Marks and Spencer, for which his wife was designing lace underwear; he wrote a history of the firm, which remained unpublished.<br>
<br>Estorick began to collect twentieth-century Italian art after the war, and with his wife travelled frequently to Italy in the late 1940s and 1950s, visiting dealers and artists' studios. His interests focused on Italian futurism, the movement launched by the poet Marinetti in 1909 as an attempt to develop an aesthetic based on modern life and technology, especially speed and the machine. He acquired paintings by all the leading futurists, including Giacomo Balla's <span class="italic">La mano del violinista</span> (1912), Umberto Boccioni's <span class="italic">Idolo moderno</span> (1911), Carlo Carr&agrave;'s <span class="italic">Uscita dal teatro</span> (1910), Gino Severini's <span class="italic">Le boulevard</span> (1910), and Luigi Russolo's <span class="italic">La musica</span> (1911). But he also collected works by other modern Italian artists, including sculpture by Medardo Rosso, drawings and sculpture by Emilio Greco, bronzes by Giacomo Manz&ugrave; and Marino Marini, paintings and drawings by Mario Sironi and Massimo Campigli, still lifes and landscape etchings and drawings by Giorgio Morandi, and two early works, <span class="italic">Melanconia</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">The Revolt of the Sage</span> (1916), by Giorgio de Chirico. He also acquired several drawings by Modigliani, including <span class="italic">Caryatid</span> (1916), and the oil portrait <span class="italic">Dr Fran&ccedil;ois Brabander</span> (1918). He put his collection on show in a series of public exhibitions beginning in 1954, and in 1956 mounted an exhibition, &#145;Modern Italian Art from the Estorick Collection&#146;, composed entirely of works from his own collection, at the Tate Gallery in London. In 1979 the Italian government awarded him the title <i>commendatore</i> for his services in promoting Italian art.<br>
<br>In 1960 Estorick gave up collecting and moved to full-time art dealing. He opened the Grosvenor Gallery in Mayfair that year, selling works by artists such as Chagall and Magritte as well as by previously unknown painters, especially from Czechoslovakia. He also turned his attention to modern Russian art, in particular the art of the Russian avant-garde during the revolutionary period, and he mounted an exhibition in 1965 of the works of Oskar Rabin (<i>b</i>. 1928), the leader of &#145;unofficial art&#146; in Russia in the 1960s, the first one-man show by a living Russian artist. He also mounted the first London exhibition devoted to El Lissitsky, in 1966. This was followed by &#145;Aspects of Russian Experimental Art, 1900&#150;1925&#146; in 1967. In 1966 he began to buy work by the Russian-born French artist, illustrator, costume and set designer Ert&eacute; (Romain de Tertoff), whose art deco work had been popular in the 1930s. After the success of the first London Ert&eacute; exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1967, when the Victoria and Albert Museum bought many of his works, the Estoricks signed an exclusive contract with Ert&eacute;, and initiated a series of one-man exhibitions in Europe and the United States which brought him back into the public eye and made him one of the best-selling artists of the 1980s. Estorick published <span class="italic">Ert&eacute;, the Last Works: graphics and Sculptures</span> in 1992.<br>
<br>Estorick moved to St Peter, Barbados, in 1975. In the 1980s he made frequent visits to Israel as a benefactor of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, where he donated a study area as a memorial to his wife after her death in 1989. He was involved in establishing the centre for Jewish art at the Hebrew University, where he helped to document Jewish art from the Soviet Union, and he financed exhibitions in Jerusalem of William Blake, Leon Bakst, Ert&eacute;, and the Russian avant-garde.<br>
<br>Estorick&#151;described by one observer as &#145;a large bearded figure with intelligent owl-like eyes and a serious, almost pained expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>)&#151;died on 25 December 1993 at Flat 21, 22 St James's Square, Westminster, London, following a heart attack. Shortly before his death he had set up the Eric and Salome Estorick Foundation, and in 1998 the Estorick collection of modern Italian art opened in Northampton Lodge, Islington, London, a permanent collection of eighty works of art, considered to be one of the best collections of modern Italian art outside Italy, with space for temporary exhibitions from other collections and a library of over 2000 books, mainly on early twentieth-century Italian art.<br>
