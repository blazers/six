<span class="headword">Asher,  Asher</span>  (1837&#150;1889), <span class="occ">physician and community worker</span>, was born on 16 February 1837 in Glasgow, the first son of Philip Asher, son of Rabbi Zev Wolf of Lublin, and his wife, Hannah, a native of the Netherlands. From an early age he was an assiduous scholar of Jewish and secular subjects, winning prizes at St Enoch's parish school, Glasgow high school, and the University of Glasgow; his medical degree in 1856, when he was only nineteen years old, was the first achieved by a Glasgow-born Jew. At first he worked as a parochial medical officer in the mining town of Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow. He augmented the meagre &pound;15 annual income with private medical work, while always being ready to treat the needy without charge. He was active within the small Jewish community of about two hundred souls then in Glasgow, serving as the first Jewish medical officer to the Hebrew Philanthropic Society from 1858 and as honorary secretary of the Hebrew congregation from 1860.<br>
<br>Asher left for London in 1862 and joined Jacob Canstatt in practice, devotedly providing medical care for the Jewish poor of London under the auspices of the newly formed London Jewish Board of Guardians. His meticulously recorded accounts of the health of those he cared for are clear evidence of his concern and desire to improve their medical lot. In 1866 he became secretary to the Great Synagogue in London, though he remained involved in giving advice on health matters (especially during the 1866 London cholera outbreak). On the formation of the United Synagogue in 1870 he became its first secretary. His diplomatic and financial skills were of great assistance in the establishment and smooth functioning of the fledgeling body. He was credited with the early success of the United Synagogue's programme for visiting hospitals, prisons, and asylums, and acted as an able representative of the community to the Home Office and hospital authorities. He was involved in the founding of the Jewish convalescent home at Norwood and was its honorary medical officer. Thus, combining his medical and organizational skills, Asher continued to work tirelessly for the Jewish poor. In January 1864 he married Lucy, daughter of Samuel Garcia, a prominent member of the Sephardi Jewish community in London; they had two sons, Pinchas (Philip) and Samuel, and one daughter, Hannah.<br>
<br>Co-operating with leading philanthropists Asher travelled to Russia, the United States, and the Holy Land, giving advice on ameliorating the lot of Jewish immigrants. He visited Jerusalem with Samuel Montagu in 1875 to report on conditions in the city for the Moses Montefiore Testimonial Fund, set up to mark the great philanthropist's ninetieth birthday, which led to improvements in the situation of the Jews there. However, he was criticized within the traditional community of the Old Yishuv because of his emphasis on secular education. Asher maintained close links with the Rothschild family, regularly enlisting their support for communal and charitable matters. His knowledge of Yiddish and of medicine were of great value in screening the thousands of Jewish refugees from Russia who poured through London after 1880, and in his assessment of their plight in Galicia during his visit in 1884.<br>
<br>Asher combined strict religious observance with a considerable freedom of thought and an abhorrence of those customs which he condemned as superstitious. His tact, diplomacy, and understanding of the views of others were legendary. When asked by the relatives of a sick man, &#145;Shall we have him blessed?&#146; he would reply, &#145;Yes, if it gives you satisfaction, but&#151;dont forget to give him the medicine regularly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 11 Jan 1889). Blessed with an encyclopaedic knowledge, Asher's Jewish learning encompassed the full range of rabbinic literature. He wrote extensively on Jewish life and practice and was a frequent correspondent on these subjects in the columns of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>. Asher took a special interest in <i>brit mila</i> and was a leading member of the Chevrat Haknesset Brit (Circumcision Society). In 1873 he published a monograph on circumcision which dealt with the religious and historical aspects of the rite, and his belief that circumcision should be conducted in conformity with both <i>halacha</i> (religious law) and modern surgical practice.<br>
<br>Asher's death at his home, 18 Endsleigh Street, Tavistock Square, London, at only fifty-one years, of lung cancer, on 7 January 1889, was widely mourned. He was survived by his wife. He was buried in Willesden cemetery on 9 January. Asher left a legacy of religious practice, intellectual rigour, and devotion to Jewish study allied with often somewhat heterodox views. A memorial plaque was erected in his memory at the entrance of the Garnethill synagogue, home of the Scottish Jewish Archives Centre. The Asher Asher memorial gold medal was instituted in 1910 to be awarded annually at the University of Glasgow in the class of diseases of the throat and nose. Asher remained deeply respected in Glasgow as a role model for religious and secular learning and for communal service.<br>
<br>Asher's career was of great significance. He graduated in medicine at a time when, because of the <span class="roman">University Test Acts</span> (which were not repealed until 1872), professing Jews in Britain could obtain university medical degrees only in Scotland. In the years after Asher's death, following persecution and economic disruption in eastern Europe and mass migration westwards, the Jewish community in Glasgow grew rapidly, numbering about 8000 by 1914. It was to be the sons of these immigrants who were to utilize the educational opportunities available, entering the University of Glasgow above all, in significant numbers and almost to the exclusion of all other subjects, to follow Asher's example and study medicine. Indeed, his obituary in the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> remarked that Asher exemplified the union of thought combined with practice in the noble tradition of the great Jewish physician Moses Maimonides (1135&#150;1204).<br>
