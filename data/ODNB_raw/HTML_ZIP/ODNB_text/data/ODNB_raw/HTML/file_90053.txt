</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Redgrove,  Peter William</span>  (1932&#150;2003), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born on 2 January 1932 at 9 Lanherne, Kingston Hill, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the elder son of Gordon James (Jim) Redgrove (1905&#150;1989), an advertising copywriter, and his wife, Nancy Lena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cestrilli-Bell (1903&#150;1980). His brother, David, born in 1937, was to die in a tragic accident in 1957. The family circumstances were those of the comfortable and conventional middle class, and Redgrove went to kindergarten in Norbiton, where an ambivalent attitude towards Jesus and religion took root. He discovered an early interest in dinosaurs and the microscopic world, seeing himself as &#145;a small Faust&#146;  (&#145;A poet in teaching&#146;, 171). Insects and visions of microscopic life were to provide an important theme in his work. From 1945 to 1949 he attended Taunton School, Somerset, where he became a school prefect, played squash, joined the natural history society, and developed what was to be a lifelong interest in photography. His experience of national service was less conformist, and he was diagnosed with incipient schizophrenia and subjected to insulin shock treatment, an experience which soon surfaced in his poetry.<br>
<br>In 1951 Redgrove went to Queens' College, Cambridge, on an open scholarship to read natural sciences, but by his own account he found the syllabus mechanical and felt himself to be a &#145;barbarian scientist&#146; on the wrong side of the culture gap: he began to read and write poetry, met poets (including Ted Hughes), attended the open lectures of F. R. Leavis, and attempted unsuccessfully to change to English. In 1953 he co-founded (with Rodney Banister) the magazine <span class="italic">delta</span>, in the second issue of which appeared &#145;Lazarus and the Sea&#146;, a powerful poem about his shock treatment, prefiguring in subject matter the work of Sylvia Plath. He shortly handed over the editorship of <span class="italic">delta</span> to Philip Hobsbaum. Redgrove also attended the supportive but critically intense London meetings of The Group, which had been founded in Cambridge in 1952, and of which Hobsbaum was the leading member. The poet Peter Porter later recalled Redgrove's memorable appearances at the afternoon drinking clubs in the London of this period. On 10 July 1954 Redgrove married the sculptor Barbara Mary Sherlock, one of whose drawings, &#145;The Good Listener&#146;, had appeared in <span class="italic">delta 2</span>. She was two years older than him, the daughter of John Edward Sherlock, businessman. The marriage produced two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Redgrove left Cambridge in 1954 without a degree, and struggled to make a living by writing medical advertising copy. His first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">The Collector</span> (1960), was followed by <span class="italic">The Nature of Cold Weather</span> (1961), <span class="italic">At the White Monument</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">The Force</span> (1966). In 1961 he became visiting poet at Buffalo University on a Fulbright award, and in 1962&#150;5 Gregory fellow in poetry at Leeds, a post which gave him time for his own work. In 1966 he moved to Cornwall as resident author at the Falmouth School of Art, which was to remain his base until 1983, and where he became renowned as an eccentric and innovative mentor, and a key figure in the move to establish creative writers in academic institutions.<br>
<br>In Falmouth Redgrove studied dream analysis with the retired Jungian psychotherapist John Layard. The greater permissiveness of the 1960s affected Redgrove's marriage: he claimed to have married, according to middle class &#145;tribal values&#146;, the first woman to whom he made love, and sexual mores were now rapidly changing  (<span class="italic">Hudson Review</span>, 379). In 1969 he met the novelist Penelope Diane Shuttle (<i>b</i>. 1947), daughter of Jack Frederick Shuttle, office administrator&#151;an encounter which had a profound influence on his life and work. He and his first wife separated and were divorced in 1969, and in 1970 Shuttle settled with him in Falmouth. They had one daughter, and were married three years later on 16 September 1980.<br>
<br>From 1970 onwards Redgrove and Shuttle embarked on an exceptionally productive and intense literary and personal collaboration, exploring sexuality and the stuff of dreams. In an exchange and merging of roles he began to write fiction, and she to write poetry. His earlier collections described the strain of combining the writing of poetry with an office life as breadwinner and family man: his poetry and prose now began to flourish with uninhibited, erotic, and oceanic vigour. <span class="italic">Dr Faust's Sea-Spiral Spirit</span> (1972) contained one of his most celebrated poems, &#145;The Idea of Entropy at Maenporth Beach&#146;, dedicated to his magus Layard and paying tribute to &#145;The Idea of Order at Key West&#146; by Wallace Stevens: its central image is of a white-bodied woman immersing herself gloriously in the richness of black mud. This collection was followed by <span class="italic">In the Country of the Skin</span> (1973), a poetic novel adapted in the same year as a radio play; and then by an uninterrupted surge of volumes of poetry, prose poems, fiction, radio plays, and works on psychology and socio-sexuality, many of them celebrating the numinous seascapes and landscapes of Cornwall, in which much of his work was deeply rooted.<br>
<br>Redgrove and Shuttle appeared as co-authors on the title pages of several volumes, including <span class="italic">The Hermaphrodite Album</span> (1973), <span class="italic">The Terrors of Dr Treviles</span> (1974), and <span class="italic">The Glass Cottage: a Nautical Romance</span> (1976). The last was a novel inspired in part by an Atlantic crossing to the USA and by Redgrove's term as O'Connor professor of literature at Colgate University, New York, in 1974&#150;5. This was his last teaching post abroad, and not a particularly happy one, though he and Shuttle both wrote copiously while they were there. In 1978 they published jointly <span class="italic">The Wise Wound: Menstruation and Everywoman</span>, a pioneering work investigating the mythologies and realities of female menstrual experience, thus breaking a taboo which even Jung had observed; it was also remarkable for its bold examination of popular culture and horror films.<br>
<br>The works that appeared under Redgrove's sole name were also informed and affected by Shuttle's critiques and inspiration: both poets acknowledged that some of their writing was so deeply fused that it was impossible to disentangle authorship. Redgrove's output was prodigious, and although some of his volumes interweaved overlapping material, the originality of his inspiration was unmistakable, and drew comparisons with the work of William Blake. His productivity daunted some readers, colleagues, and critics, but his genius was widely recognized, and he received various awards, including the Guardian fiction prize (1973), the Prix Italia (1982), the Cholmondeley award (1985), and the queen's gold medal for poetry (1996). He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1982.<br>
<br>Redgrove's many poetry collections included <span class="italic">The Weddings at Nether Powers</span> (1979), <span class="italic">The Apple-Broadcast</span> (1981), <span class="italic">The Man Named East</span> (1985), <span class="italic">In the Hall of the Saurians</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">My Father's Trapdoors</span> (1994): all were marked by vitality of language, visionary insights, scenes of domestic transfiguration, striking imagery drawn from the natural (and unnatural) sciences, and a kind of good-humoured, life-affirming wit and joyfulness. Later volumes contained memorable evocations of the trickster figure of his father. His poetic spirit, often contrasted with the more violent tone of Ted Hughes (who championed Redgrove's work) was largely benign. He was not a formalist, and his verse swept and flowed effortlessly, overwhelming metrical orthodoxy, but the verbal texture of his work withstands close scrutiny. His poems have been widely anthologized, but their true impact relies on a cumulative power. His reading was vast and eclectic, and his work was rich in allusion. <span class="italic">The Black Goddess and the Sixth Sense</span> (1987) was an encyclopaedic prose study described by Shuttle as &#145;a man's menstrual vision&#146;  (<span class="italic">We Two</span>, 125), which addressed hidden or suppressed knowledge of the senses: it revealed him as acutely weather-sensitive, with a heightened awareness of barometric pressure, magnetism, and other unseen forces. It also pursued earlier explorations of gender, archetype, and repressive patriarchy.<br>
<br>Redgrove was a man of great physical presence and strength, with a full and magnificent speaking voice, which had won him a verse-speaking award at Cambridge, and which he continued to employ to great effect: he read his poems with a musical and ceremonial precision, giving weight to every syllable. He practised yoga and judo (achieving the British Judo Association first kyu, or brown belt) and was famed in his youth for being able to tear a London telephone directory apart with his bare hands. He enjoyed wine and beer, and wrote evocatively about the pleasures of drinking: one small volume (<span class="italic">The Mudlark Poems and Grand Buveur</span>, 1986) was largely devoted to this topic. Towards the end of his life, when suffering from late-onset diabetes and Parkinson's disease, he regretted the dietary restrictions his ill health imposed upon him. One of his best-loved late poems  (&#145;Elderhouse&#146;, <span class="italic">From the Virgil Caverns</span>, 2002) poignantly celebrated a simple glass of tap water in a Falmouth caf&eacute;.<br>
<br>In 2001 Redgrove was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Sheffield, where his principal archives are housed. He died on 16 June 2003, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, of a combination of causes, chiefly renal failure due to a diabetic infection. He was cremated in Truro on 23 June 2003, and his ashes were scattered on Maenporth beach on 19 September 2004. He was survived by his wife, Penelope, and a son and two daughters, one son from his first marriage having predeceased him.<br>
