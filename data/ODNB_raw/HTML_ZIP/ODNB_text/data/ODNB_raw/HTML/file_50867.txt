<span class="headword">Lizars,  William Home</span>  (1788&#150;1859), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 4 May 1788, the son of <a name="cosubject_50867"></a><span class="headword">Daniel Lizars</span>  (1760&#150;1812), who worked as a <span class="occ">printer and engraver in Edinburgh</span>, and his wife, Margaret Home. Daniel Lizars was a student of the engraver Andrew Bell. He engraved Raeburn's portrait of Lord Braxfield, but was better known for his views of Edinburgh, including <span class="italic">Perspective View of South Bridge Street</span>, which appeared in the 1786 edition of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>. Six of his works were also mentioned in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Scene</span>, among them <span class="italic">View of the New Bridge of Edinburgh</span>. He died in Edinburgh on 10 December 1812.<br>
<br>William Home Lizars was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh. He was then apprenticed to his father, from whom he learned engraving, but in order to pursue his ambition to become a professional painter he entered the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh, under John Graham. It is possible that at about this time he took painting lessons from Alexander Nasmyth. Certainly he was influenced by Nasmyth's emphasis on the importance of drawing, but his contemporary David Wilkie played a significant role in the development of his work. Indeed, Lizars's arresting portrait of an Edinburgh beggar, John Cowper (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), painted in 1808 when the artist was just twenty years old, was formerly attributed to Wilkie. Lizars's early promise was noticed, and the same year he received a commission to paint David Steuart Erskine, eleventh earl of Buchan.<br>
<br>Between 1808 and 1815 Lizars exhibited portraits and genre paintings in Edinburgh. In 1812 he exhibited two works at the Royal Academy in London; <span class="italic">Reading the will</span> and <span class="italic">A Scotch Wedding</span> (both National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh) were hung on the line, where they were much admired, and both were later engraved. They illustrate clearly Lizars's skilful observation of character and still life. His use of dramatic lighting and anecdotal detail reveal his debt to seventeenth-century Dutch artists and Adriaen Brouwer in particular, a debt that he shared with David Wilkie (as was revealed when Wilkie tackled the same subjects a few years later).<br>
<br>In the same year that Lizars achieved acclaim with these two works, his father died and, in spite of his recent success as a painter, he decided to concentrate on the business of engraving and copperplate printing in order to support his mother and family. With his artistic and printmaking background it is perhaps hardly surprising that Lizars proved to be a superb topographical draughtsman, etcher, and illustrator, and it is as an engraver that he subsequently became best known. The family firm, which he ran with his brother Daniel, was known variously as W. and D. Lizars or W. H. and D. Lizars. It produced a variety of printed material, including many illustrated maps, charts, anatomical plates, and Scottish scenes. Lizars perfected a method of copper-engraving which imitated the effect of wood-engraving and first used this for the frontispiece to J. G. Lockhart's <span class="italic">Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk</span> in June 1819. An important illustrative project was reproducing the design of the architect Andrew Elliot for the national monument of Scotland and, together with Andrew Geddes and John Thomson, he recorded the Scottish regalia following their rediscovery in 1818. He also illustrated news events&#151;such as the fire in the Old Town of Edinburgh in 1824, and engraved paintings, such as Richard Dadd's <span class="italic">Puck and the Fairies</span>. In 1826 Lizars met J. J. Audubon when he visited Edinburgh, and later he engraved the first ten plates of his <span class="italic">Birds of America</span>, the remainder being undertaken by the Havell firm in London. Early in their subsequently very successful careers Lizars employed two Glasgow artists, Horatio McCulloch and Daniel McNee, to hand-colour prints.<br>
<br>Lizars was closely involved with the founding of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1826 and that year was appointed an associate engraver. In 1832 Lizars's company was declared bankrupt and the following year Daniel Lizars emigrated to Canada. William Home Lizars married, first, Eliza, whose portrait bust of 1852 by Patrick Park RSA (1811&#150;1855) is in the collections of Aberdeen Art Gallery, and, second, Henrietta Wilson. He died in High Town, Galashiels, on 30 March 1859, leaving a widow and family, although this may not have been Henrietta. He was buried at St Cuthbert's churchyard, Edinburgh. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, houses several intimate studies by him in chalk and pencil, including depictions of the sculptor John Flaxman, the naturalist Sir William Jardine, and the agriculturist James Smith of Deanstone.<br>
