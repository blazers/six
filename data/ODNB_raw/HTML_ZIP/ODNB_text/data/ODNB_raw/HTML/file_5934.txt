<span class="headword">Collins,  Arthur</span>  (1681/2&#150;1760), <span class="occ">genealogist</span>, was the son of William Collins, a gentleman usher to Charles II's consort, Queen Catherine of Braganza, and his wife, Elizabeth Blyth, daughter of Thomas Blyth. It seems likely that the family was Roman Catholic and that record of birth and marriage would have been found among the records of the Portuguese embassy chapel, which have not survived. Collins is said to have been given a liberal education and to have dissipated a large fortune in his youth. Certainly, he later spent much on his publishing ventures. He is first noticed as a bookseller at &#145;the Black Boy, opposite St Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street&#146;, in partnership with Abel Roper, a name which appears among those of the publishers of Dugdale's <span class="italic">Baronage</span> issued in 1675&#150;6.<br>
<br>From most written letters of his forty-seven years in publishing peerages, Collins appears to have lived in Enfield and, towards the end of his life, in Holloway. He married in 1708, though the identity of his wife is unknown. Of several children, one son was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy who served in two campaigns in the Netherlands, at the battles of Fontenoy, Falkirk, and Culloden, and died in 1756. Another was Major-General Arthur Tooker Collins, whose name may give a clue to the identity of his mother.<br>
<br>In 1709 the first edition of Collins's <span class="italic">The peerage of England, or, An historical and genealogical account of the present nobility &hellip; collected as well from our best historians, publick records, and other sufficient authorities, as from the personal information of most of the nobility</span>, was published anonymously, although it was described on the title-page as &#145;printed &hellip; for Abel Roper and Arthur Collins&#146;. An octavo volume of only 470 pages, it supplied a want by its meagre accounts of noble families and of peerages conferred after the publication of Dugdale's <span class="italic">Baronage</span>. In the preface to the larger second edition, again printed for A. Collins (2 vols. and supplement, 1712&#150;16), Collins spoke of the extraordinary success of the first. In the text of the 1712 edition Collins inserted rather crude woodcuts of armorial bearings, &#145;as they may be serviceable to instruct young gentlemen in the terms of Heraldry&#146;, which would not be &#145;a sufficient excuse for their not being done in a more commendable manner, were it not known to be an almost impracticable work of printing them with these sheets to any manner of perfection&#146;  (A. Collins, <span class="italic">The Peerage of England</span>, 2nd edn, 1, pt 1, 1712, preface).<br>
<br>In 1716, in expectation of a situation in the custom house, Collins gave up his business in Fleet Street, but his <span class="italic">Baronetage of England, being an Historical Account of Baronets from their First Introduction</span> appeared in 1720 with a dedication to John Anstis, Garter king of arms. Collins's preface stressed the care he had taken with documentation and described great &#145;discouragements&#146; in compiling the work caused by the failure of many families to let him see their pedigrees. The bibliographer Thomas Moule described the work as being &#145;as free of error as any of his successors in this laborious pursuit&#146;  (Moule, 308). In March 1723 Collins wrote to Sir Robert Walpole stating his continued poverty and expectations of some provision from the government; he explained that he did not intend to publish any more editions of the <span class="italic">Baronetage</span> but was instead preparing an enlarged peerage. A single-volume instalment was issued in 1727 as <span class="italic">The English baronage, or, An historical account of the lives and most memorable actions of our nobility, with their descent, marriages, and issue</span>. Dedicated with a flattering note on Sir Robert Walpole and an account of his family in the preliminary address to the reader, Collins commemorated the elevation to the peerage of Sir Robert's eldest son. He stated that &#145;with much labour, and at no small expense&#146; he had made large collections of material for his <span class="italic">Baronage</span> and that he intended to publish the peerage in order of precedence. He admitted to having a manuscript of Dugdale's work with many additions by Gregory King, Lancaster herald, to which he had added his own researched notes.<br>
<br>Greatly benefiting from King's work, Collins published his <span class="italic">Proceedings, precedents and arguments, on claims and controversies concerning the baronies by writ and other honours</span> in 1734, dedicated to Spencer Compton, earl of Wilmington. In 1735 the first edition to be entitled Collins's <span class="italic">Peerage</span> appeared in three volumes, with engravings of the arms, crests, and supporters of the then existing peers. In a second edition of 1741 he added copious references to his authorities and dedicated the four volumes to the duke of Rutland, the earl of Halifax, and Walpole, which brought him some of the financial support he required. Thomas Wotton edited Collins's work for another edition, published as <span class="italic">The English Baronetage</span> (5 vols., 1741) but more accurately known as <span class="italic">Wotton's Baronetage</span>, in which the volume on marquesses and earls was dedicated to another benefactor, the earl of Shaftesbury. Acknowledging the assistance of Collins, Wotton admitted his obligations to the works of Peter Le Neve, which he had purchased in 1731.<br>
<br>In the preface to his two-volume supplement (1750) to the 1741 edition of the <span class="italic">Peerage</span> Collins complained that he had spent his fortune in researches and would be unable to publish the results without help. Pathetically, he contrasted the neglect of himself with the favour which had been shown to Dugdale and Ashmole. In a plaintive letter to the duke of Newcastle, dated 3 February 1752, he wrote that he was engaged on a new edition of the <span class="italic">Peerage</span> but did not have the funds to pay for a transcriber. At the same time he acknowledged kindness from Lord Granville. In a subsequent letter to the duke of Newcastle he blamed his poverty on the cost of printing his account of Newcastle's mother's family, the Holles family, and asked for a warranty for some money. Ultimately he received a pension of &pound;400 a year from the king, which enabled him to complete the third of the enlarged editions of his <span class="italic">Peerage</span> (1756), dedicated to the king, the earls of Shaftesbury, Holdernesse, and Northumberland, and the marquess of Abergavenny. This was the last to be overseen by Collins himself. His confidence had been so enhanced that he could proudly write,<blockquote>I am not conscious of delivering the least untruth; my accounts of these, and other families I have published, being warranted by Records and Informations I cannot distrust &hellip; and my readers may be appraised by the authorities I have cited, and which prove the difficulties of the undertaking, and the expense that attends the performance. (A. Collins, <span class="italic">The Peerage of England</span>, 3rd edn, 1756, preface)</blockquote>He acknowledged the assistance of antiquaries such as Charles Townley, Clarenceux king of arms.<br>
<br>Three posthumous editions of Collins's <span class="italic">Peerage</span> were published: the fifth edition was edited by the engraver Barak Longmate, and brought the work up to date, and the final edition (1812), edited by Sir Egerton Brydges, became the standard work before the appearance of G. E. Cockayne's <span class="italic">Complete Peerage</span>. In his preface Brydges described the exceptional and indefatigable industry of Collins, and the general accuracy, which rivalled Dugdale, whose method Collins had, by and large, followed.<br>
<br>Collins exhibited modesty in describing himself as a printer or a bookseller. He did not presume to call himself an author for some ten years. His general disinterestedness must be set against what may often seem to be adulation of birth and rank. In his own words he stated that his only inducement to persevere was &#145;an innate desire to preserve the memory of famous men&#146;  (A. Collins, <span class="italic">Historical Collections of the Noble Families of Cavendish, Holles, Vere, and Harley, and Ogle</span>, 1752, preface). He was, none the less, self-assured as a scholarly researcher. Carlyle, in his rectorial address to the students of Edinburgh University, acknowledged that he &#145;got a great deal of help out of poor Collins&#146;, when writing his life of Oliver Cromwell, and he pronounced Collins's <span class="italic">Peerage</span> to be &#145;a very poor peerage as a work of genius, but an excellent book for diligence and fidelity&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In a letter of 9 February 1752 to the duke of Newcastle, Collins says: &#145;I have left, in manuscript, an account of my family, my life, and the cruel usage I have undeservedly undergone&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.392), but no trace of its survival or of other papers has been discovered. He had expended not only a lifetime of labour but all that he possessed, as he observed with customary candour and innocence of courtly customs in his last preface:<blockquote>I could cite instances of other authors, that have been preferred, though it has been my hard fate to be soliciting the chief of power (his Majesty and the royal family excepted) for several years without effect, and have not been wanting in setting forth, by printed case, my pretensions to preferment, a Place having been resigned to me by a relation, and given from me to proceed on the work I have been engaged in, with a promise of being better provided for. (A. Collins, <span class="italic">The Peerage of England</span>, 3rd edn, 1756, preface)</blockquote>Collins was an assiduous researcher and a prolific compiler and editor. To several smaller and unpublished works, he added an ephemeral package of papers on peerage, families, and other matters published between 1732 and 1756. These works, which would challenge scholars of any era, included <span class="italic">The Life of William Cecil, Lord Burleigh</span> (1732), <span class="italic">The Life and Glorious Actions of Edward, Prince of Wales, Commonly called the Black Prince</span> (1740), which, with <span class="italic">The History of John of Gaunt</span> (1740), was written for the uncompleted <span class="italic">English Baronage</span> of 1727. Similarly, he published genealogical and historical accounts of the Harley, Sackville, Percy, Windsor, and Carteret families, and made extensive use of the papers owned by the Sydney family to publish <span class="italic">Letters and Memorials of State</span> from the reign of Queen Mary through to that of Charles II. He published a volume of papers belonging to the Cavendish, Holles, Vere, Harley, and Ogle families, with the financial help of the countess of Oxford.<br>
<br>Collins died on 16 March 1760 in Holloway, aged seventy-eight, and was buried in Battersea church. It is known that he was survived by his son Major-General Arthur Tooker Collins, who died on 4 January 1793, leaving a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5937/', "David Collins")</script>. David Collins was judge-advocate in New South Wales, lieutenant-governor of Van Dieman's Land, and author of <span class="italic">An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</span> (2 vols., 1798&#150;1802).<br>
