<span class="headword">Seymour, Sir  George Francis</span>  (1787&#150;1870), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25175/', "Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour (1759&#150;1801)")</script> and his wife, Anne Horatia (<i>d</i>. 1801), the daughter of James Waldegrave, second Earl Waldegrave, was born on 17 September 1787. He entered the navy in October 1797 on board the yacht <i>Princess Augusta</i> with Captain Edward Riou, and from March 1798 to September 1801 was with his father in the <i>Sanspareil</i> and the <i>Prince of Wales</i> in the channel and the West Indies. In 1802&#150;3 he was in the <i>Endymion</i>, mostly on the home station, with Captain John Larmour, and afterwards with the Hon. Charles Paget. Towards the end of 1803 he was sent out to the <i>Victory</i>, Nelson's flagship in the Mediterranean, and in February 1804 was transferred to the <i>Madras</i> as acting lieutenant. A few weeks later he was moved into the <i>Donegal</i> with Sir Richard John Strachan, then from early 1805 with Pulteney Malcolm. On 12 October 1804 Seymour was confirmed lieutenant, and, continuing in the <i>Donegal</i>, took part in the chase of the allied fleet to the West Indies and back and in the capture of the Spanish ship <i>El Rayo</i> immediately after the battle of Trafalgar.<br>
<br>Early in 1806 Seymour joined the <i>Northumberland</i>, the flagship of Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane, in the West Indies, and on 6 February took part in the battle of Santo Domingo, where he was severely wounded in the jaw by grapeshot. He had already been promoted commander on 22 January 1806, and on 9 February was appointed to the sloop <i>Kingfisher</i>, in which, on 14 May, he was in company with Lord Cochrane in the <i>Pallas</i>, and was able to rescue him from a dangerous position in the entrance of the Basque Roads. On 29 July 1806 he was posted to command the <i>Aurora</i> in the Mediterranean, from which, in February 1808, he was moved to the <i>Pallas</i> on the home station. In April 1809 she was attached to the fleet with Lord Gambier off the Basque Roads, and on the 12th Seymour made a gallant effort to support Cochrane in his attempt to destroy the French ships. Afterwards, at the court martial on Lord Gambier, he supported Cochrane's assertion that the whole might have been destroyed.<br>
<br>In September 1809 Seymour was appointed to the frigate <i>Manilla</i> (36 guns), which was lost off the Texel in January 1812 during his temporary absence. In February 1811 he married Georgiana Mary (<i>d</i>. 1878), the daughter of Admiral Sir George Cranfield Berkeley; they had four daughters and three sons. In June 1812 he was assigned to the <i>Fortun&eacute;e</i>, and from January 1813 to September 1814 he commanded the <i>Leonidas</i> in the West Indies. On 4 June 1815 he was nominated a CB, and on 28 May 1816 was awarded a pension of &pound;250 for his wound received in the battle of Santo Domingo. From 1818 to 1841 he was sergeant-at-arms to the House of Lords. In 1827 he commanded the <i>Briton</i> for a few months on particular service. He was naval aide-de-camp to William IV from August to November 1830, and from that time until the king's death was master of the robes. In 1831 he was made a KCH and on 9 December 1834 GCH. He was promoted rear-admiral on 23 November 1841.<br>
<br>From September 1841 to May 1844 Seymour was one of the lords of the Admiralty, where he repeatedly quarrelled with the senior naval lord, Sir George Cockburn, on the direction of policy. As a result he was appointed commander-in-chief in the Pacific, where &#145;the tact, ability, and decision&#146; he showed during the strained relations with France over the &#145;Pritchard affair&#146; and the negotiations with the United States about the fisheries, were formally recognized by the government. He arrived home in 1848.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1850 Seymour was made vice-admiral and on 7 April 1852 a KCB. From January 1851 to November 1853 he was commander-in-chief on the North America and West Indies station. In late 1853 he was considered for the command of the Baltic fleet, then being prepared, but arrangements to bring him home foundered on the refusal of his nominated successor to take the post. By the time he reached England, in March 1854, the Baltic fleet had been given to Sir Charles Napier, and Seymour served from January 1856 to March 1859 as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. On 14 May 1857 he was promoted to the rank of admiral. He was nominated a GCB on 18 May 1860, rear-admiral of the United Kingdom in April 1863, vice-admiral in September 1865, and admiral of the fleet on 30 November 1866. He died of bronchitis at his London residence, 115 Eaton Square, on 20 January 1870. Seymour was an intelligent and resourceful officer, successful in all his commands. Although he was a tory, and a personal favourite of William IV, his marriage brought him into contact with the whig naval aristocracy. He impressed Lord Haddington during his time at the Admiralty by his willingness to stand up to the formidable Cockburn.<br>
<br>His eldest son, Francis George Hugh Seymour (1812&#150;1884), in August 1870 succeeded his second cousin as fifth marquess of Hertford. He was appointed groom of the robes in 1833, was lord chamberlain from 1874 to 1879, and died at Ragley on 25 January 1884 from injuries caused by a fall from his horse.<br>
