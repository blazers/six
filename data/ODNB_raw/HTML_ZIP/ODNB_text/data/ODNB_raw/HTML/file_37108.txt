<span class="headword">Allen,  Elias</span>  (<em>c.</em>1588&#150;1653), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, was born near Tonbridge, Kent, probably in Ashurst, of unknown parentage. Apprenticed in 1602 to London instrument maker Charles Whitwell in the Grocers' Company, he served his master for nine years. Following Whitwell's death in 1611, Allen, then resident in Black Horse Alley, took his freedom on 7 July 1612, at the same time binding his first apprentice. His reputation was already sufficiently high for him to be recommended in Hopton's <span class="italic">Speculum topographicum</span> of 1611.<br>
<br>Allen soon moved to a workshop beside St Clement Danes Church, the Strand, probably the premises of his former master. He consolidated his position as foremost among the London makers of mathematical instruments, working mainly in brass but occasionally in silver. He won the patronage of various members of the aristocracy and made instruments for James I and Charles I. He also benefited from close association with leading contemporary mathematicians, in particular Edmund Gunter and William Oughtred. These two provided the instrument maker with many of his most popular designs&#151;the Gunter quadrant and sector, and Oughtred's circles of proportion (a logarithmic calculating device), double horizontal instrument (an astronomical instrument), and universal equinoctial ring dial. Surviving examples bear witness to Allen's skill in dividing scales and his artistry as an engraver.<br>
<br>Allen became an associate of the Clockmakers' Company soon after its foundation in 1631, and was appointed as an assistant on 3 October 1633. On 18 January 1636 he assumed the responsibilities of renter warden (treasurer); he was master of the company from 19 January 1637 until 29 July 1638.<br>
<br>This was the peak of Allen's career. Through hard work combined with notable ability he had created a thriving business, becoming the first English instrument maker not to be forced to supplement his income by engraving maps or practising as a surveyor. He was highly respected within London's mathematical community, his workshop being both a centre for discussions and a post office for various correspondences. His skill was esteemed by the most able mathematicians of his day, who were even prepared to alter instrument designs to accommodate his suggestions. He was also courted by his peers in the City: the master of the Vintners' Company commissioned Allen to produce a new gauging instrument. Meanwhile he profited from the increased amateur interest in mathematics which enabled him to develop a market for his wares among the gentry. His skill further showed itself in his ability to train his apprentices to the same high standards. Several of them proceeded to eminent positions in the trade; Ralph Greatorex is perhaps the best-known, by virtue of his association with Pepys. Through Robert Davenport (who settled in Edinburgh) and John Prujean (in Oxford), Allen's craft succession was spread across the country. However, it was the task of another pupil, John Allen, to train Walter Hayes, the instrument maker who inherited Allen's mantle in the latter half of the century.<br>
<br>Elias Allen's achievement is celebrated most clearly in the wealth of instruments he left, but is also commemorated by his portrait&#151;an extremely unusual accolade for a seventeenth-century artisan. The painting (known only through a later engraving by Wenceslaus Hollar) was the work of the Dutch artist Hendrik van der Borcht, and dated from about 1640. Allen's trade suffered during the civil war, forcing him to petition the Clockmakers for funds in January 1649. However, he continued to work until his death in late March 1653. He left one surviving daughter, Elizabeth; his wife, also Elizabeth, whom he married about 1606, died in 1642. He was buried on 1 April 1653 in St Clement Danes, London.<br>
