<span class="headword">Streatfeild,  Sophia</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">beauty</span>, was baptized on 9 May 1755 at St Anne's, Soho, London, the elder daughter of Henry Streatfeild (1706&#150;1762), of Chiddingstone, Kent, and his wife, Anne Sidney (1732&#150;1812), natural daughter of Jocelyne Sidney, seventh earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1743). She was tutored in Latin and Greek by Dr Arthur Collier (1707&#150;1777), lawyer and classicist. An earlier student of his was Hester Lynch Salusbury (later Thrale), whose diary, <span class="italic">Thraliana</span>, gives the fullest account of Sophia Streatfeild. Hester Thrale met her in Brighton in 1777 and described her on 19 May 1778:<blockquote>Her Face is eminently pretty, her Carriage elegant, her Heart affectionate, and her Mind cultivated. There is above all this an attractive Sweetness in her Manner, which claims &amp; promises to repay one's Confidence, &amp; which drew from me the secret of my keeping a Thraliana to deposit all kinds of Nonsense in. (Thrale, 323)</blockquote>Sophia Streatfeild's classical learning aroused Hester Thrale's jealousy, yet little is known of it; the single extant example of her scholarship is a letter to Hester Thrale that bristles with references to, and quotations from, ancient Greek authors. Samuel Johnson acknowledged her knowledge of Greek, though he did not rate her intelligence. At her death her library contained forty-three volumes of Greek literature.<br>
<br>Hester Thrale had further occasion to be jealous of Sophia Streatfeild, as her husband, Henry Thrale, was much taken with her. As early as December 1778 she wrote in a footnote, &#145;I see my Husband is in love with her&#146;  (Thrale, 348, n. 1). Not long thereafter, under 10 January 1779, she wrote:<blockquote>M<sup>r</sup> Thrale has fallen in Love <i>really &amp; seriously</i> with Sophy Streatfeild&#151;but there is no wonder in that: She is very pretty, very gentle, soft &amp; insinuating; hangs about him, dances round him, cries when She parts from him, squeezes his Hand slyly, &amp; with her sweet Eyes full of Tears looks so fondly in his Face&#151;&amp; all for <i>Love of me</i> as She pretends; that I can hardly sometimes help laughing in her Face. (ibid., 356)</blockquote>Hester Thrale repeatedly refers to her husband's obsession with Sophia, and also records other amorous conquests of hers. Her favourite in May 1781 was William Vyse, of Lichfield, yet she was rumoured to have considered Lord Loughborough as a suitor. In the previous autumn she had dazzled Beilby Porteus, bishop of Chester and for fifteen years a married man. According to Hester Thrale, &#145;She shewed me a Letter from him that was as tender, and had all the <i>Tokens</i> upon it as strong as I ever remember to have seen 'em&#146;  (ibid., 761). The last of Sophia's conquests to be named was Dr Charles Burney: &#145;he is <i>now</i> the reigning Favourite, and she spares neither Pains nor Caresses, to turn that poor Man's head, much to the Vexation of his Family&#146;  (ibid., 523). In exasperation Hester Thrale summed up Sophia Streatfeild's character thus:<blockquote>a Young Coquet whose sole Employment in this World seems to have been winning Men's hearts on purpose to fling them away. How She contrives to keep Bishops, &amp; Brewers, &amp; Doctors, &amp; Directors of the East India Company all in her Chains so&#151;&amp; almost all at a Time would amaze a wiser Person than me. (ibid., 523)</blockquote>Sophia Streatfeild died, unmarried, on 30 November 1835 and was buried in her native Chiddingstone, Kent, where there is a memorial tablet to her in the church. Her library was sold by W. H. Robinson Ltd. Edward Burney's drawings of the characters from <span class="italic">Evelina</span>, by his cousin Fanny Burney, supposedly depict Sophia Streatfeild as Evelina.<br>
