<span class="headword">Currie, Sir  James</span>  (1868&#150;1937), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 31 May 1868, the eldest son of the Revd James Currie, principal of the Church of Scotland Training College, Edinburgh, and his wife, Jane Lyall, daughter of George Key, of St Vigeans, Forfarshire. He was educated at Fettes College, at Edinburgh University, and at Lincoln College, Oxford, to which he gained a classical scholarship in 1888; he graduated in 1892.<br>
<br>Currie returned to Edinburgh where he taught for a number of years in one of the Scottish education board's schools, which gave him valuable practical experience. In 1899 he joined the Egyptian education department and in 1900 was selected by Lord Cromer to be the first director of education in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He had two main educational objectives. The first was to develop basic education in Western-style (but Arabic-language) elementary schools (<i>kuttabs</i>), not least in order to counteract the influence of the traditional Koranic schools (<i>khalwas</i>), officially regarded as centres of superstition and fanaticism. Consequently <i>kuttab</i> education was encouraged by the institution of a &#145;voluntary education tax&#146;, which originated as a bargain between Currie and the distinguished Sudanese educationist Babikr Bedri, and was later extended to most of the riverine northern Sudan.<br>
<br>Currie's second main objective was to train a small number of Sudanese for minor government posts. They were educated in so-called &#145;primary&#146; schools, where some English was taught. Unlike <i>kuttab</i> education, primary education was limited to the anticipated vacancies for its leavers. Between 1906 and 1914 primary enrolment was virtually static at about 770 pupils, while <i>kuttab</i> enrolment expanded from 1280 to over 3600. In the early 1900s Gordon Memorial College at Khartoum, of which Currie was <i>ex officio</i> principal, was a model primary school, upon which was superimposed a number of vocational courses. Several research institutes, including the Wellcome medical laboratories and a geological survey, were more or less loosely affiliated to the college.<br>
<br>Currie was determined to support only those types of education which served the economic needs of the Sudan. Consequently he denied even the most modest financial assistance to southern Sudanese education, and later refused to support educational ventures in the south in the absence of a comprehensive southern educational policy based on extensive anthropological and sociological research. He nevertheless did not oppose girls' education, which in the early 1900s was believed to serve no economic or administrative purpose. When in 1907 Babikr Bedri demonstrated that a girls' school could function without provoking unmanageable local opposition, Currie supported the school both financially and otherwise.<br>
<br>Before 1914 Currie was one of a small minority of civilians in an administration dominated by British officers seconded from the Egyptian army. He was not always <i>persona grata</i> to his military colleagues: some of them thought his ideas &#145;too dogmatic&#146;, even &#145;socialistic&#146;. He was moreover an outspoken supporter of the gradually growing civilian element in the administration. In 1911 he became a member of the governor-general's council. By 1912 educational expenditure had risen to 4 per cent of the Sudan government's revenue&#151;a figure which declined significantly under his successors, falling as low as 1.9 per cent in 1926. But by 1913 he felt that the administration was failing adequately to support the academic development of Gordon College. In 1914 he resigned.<br>
<br>Currie married in 1913 Hilda Beatrice, only daughter of Sir Thomas Hanbury, a merchant and botanist, of La Mortola, Ventimiglia, Italy; they had a daughter who died in childhood. On his return to Britain he settled in Wiltshire, where he farmed. He soon became involved in important war work. In 1916 he was appointed director of a new labour supply department, which trained unskilled labour for semi-skilled tasks in the manufacture of munitions. In 1918 he became controller of the Ministry of Labour's training department, which was particularly successful in the rehabilitation of disabled former servicemen. These voluntary services were recognized when he was made a KBE in 1920. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the Devizes constituency as an Asquithian Liberal in the 1918 general election.<br>
<br>In 1922 Currie became the first director of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation and in 1923 a member of the government's advisory committee on native education in tropical Africa. Between the wars he served, often as chairman, on the governing bodies of several institutions, including the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad. He was a governor of the Imperial College of Science and Technology, South Kensington. As chairman of the governors of Dauntsey's School, Devizes, he modernized and greatly enlarged a small local grammar school and gained for it a national reputation. In 1933 he was created KCMG.<br>
<br>Currie's links with the Sudan did not cease in 1914. In 1921&#150;2 he was one of the Sudan's representatives in the difficult but ultimately successful negotiations with the Treasury for the refinancing of the Sennar Dam construction works. He revisited the Sudan in 1926 and 1932. He was unhappy at the lack of educational progress, and especially at the negative effects upon education of the policy of indirect rule, which he sharply criticized in the <span class="italic">Journal of the African Society</span> (vols. 33, 1934, and 34, 1935). He was an outspoken, even combative man, and this public criticism was unwelcome in Khartoum. One senior official attributed it to Currie's &#145;failing powers&#146;. Certain other comments were even less charitable. In 1936 he suggested the secondment of Christopher Cox to serve as director of education in the Sudan. He also prompted Sir Stuart Symes to invite the De La Warr commission, set up in 1936 to report on education in British East Africa, to extend its work to the Sudan. The commission's report, published in 1937, compared the Sudan's educational progress unfavourably with that of British East Africa, a conclusion which, had he lived to read it, would have neither surprised nor displeased him. Currie died at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 17 March 1937. Until 1956 a bronze bust of him stood in the original Gordon College building of the University of Khartoum.<br>
