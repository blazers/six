<span class="headword">Lok,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1608), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the third son of Henry Lok (<i>d</i>. 1571), a London mercer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69054/', "Anne Locke, n&#233;e Vaughan (c.1530&#150;1590x1607)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16951/', "Sir William Lok")</script> was his grandfather, the traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16950/', "Michael Lok")</script> his uncle, and the versifier of the psalms Michael Cosworth his cousin. Nothing is known about his early life or education, other than Wood's unsubstantiated assertions that he was born early in Elizabeth's reign, spent some time at Oxford, and then gained the support of an unnamed nobleman at court&#151;perhaps Henry Carey, Lord Hunsdon  (Doelman, 5&#150;6). Grosart was probably confused in stating that this Henry was the parent of one Zachary Lok who in 1598 described his father as a former Levant merchant of &#145;above 64 years of age&#146;  (&#145;Poems by Henry Lok, gentleman&#146;, 2.20).<br>
<br>Lok married Ann Moyle of Cornwall, with whom he had two sons, Henry (<i>b</i>. 1592) and Charles. Perhaps motivated by these family responsibilities, Lok became one of the most productive writers of devotional poetry of the 1590s: his <span class="italic">Sundry Christian Passions</span> was published in 1593 and then reprinted in his volume entitled <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span> in 1597. The latter contained an unparalleled sequence of sixty dedicatory sonnets addressed to a veritable who's who of late-Elizabethan literary patrons. The survival at Lambeth Palace Library of a copy with the dedicatory sonnets cancelled, except for the one to Archbishop Whitgift printed alone on a leaf facing the title-page, suggests that Lok sometimes presented personalized copies to chosen individuals. Lok also contributed a commendatory poem to James VI of Scotland's <span class="italic">Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres</span> (1591), printed at Edinburgh but previously registered to Richard Field, the publisher of Lok's own two volumes.<br>
<br>The success of this literary frenzy of patronage hunting seems to have been limited. While Lok claimed in January 1597 that the countess of Warwick had encouraged him to seek a pension from Sir Robert Cecil until some suitable office became available, no employment seems to have come his way  (Doelman, 8). By early 1598 he was petitioning unsuccessfully for the collectorship of Devon; and on 8 June 1598 he even put himself forward for the position of keeper of the queen's bears and mastiffs. &#145;It is better to be a bear herd&#146;, Lok bitterly mused, &#145;than to be baited daily with great exclamations for small debts&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 60).<br>
<br>Eventually Cecil found some use for Lok in France and even acknowledged his service with the gift of a gelding. In 1599 Lok (who was skilled in cipher) was in Bayonne, assiduously collecting political information for Cecil. Unfortunately he also began to arouse the suspicions of the locals, who clearly did not believe his claim that he was merely an English traveller <i>en route</i> for Spain with the entourage of the French ambassador. Back home in England by April 1600 and living in the Strand, his services seem to have been dispensed with by Cecil. Despite his previous poetic commendation of King James's poetry, Lok fared no better during the new reign. By March 1606 he was imprisoned as an insolvent debtor in the Westminster gatehouse. In May 1608 he was again incarcerated for debt and pleaded with Cecil to be transferred to the Clink at Southwark. Desperate appeals in October 1608 to Cecil appear to have gone unanswered, after which time nothing else is known about Lok's fate. Doelman states that Lok died &#145;in Venice in 1611&#146;  (p. 11), but, in an otherwise densely noted article, he gives no citation for this assertion.<br>
<br>Lok is now best remembered for his two volumes of devotional verse, <span class="italic">Sundry Christian Passions</span> (containing 200 sonnets), and <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span>, which reprinted the first collection and added another 100 sonnets, along with a separate grouping of twenty sonnets or &#145;Peculiar Prayers&#146;. Including introductory and concluding poems, this 1597 edition contained 328 sonnets which were memorably derided in <span class="italic">The Returne from Pernassus</span> (1606) as fit only &#145;to lie in some old nooks amongst old boots and shoes&#146;.<br>
<br>More recently, however, it has been proposed that Lok's devotional poetry should be viewed as a historically important contribution to the emergence of an early seventeenth-century tradition of British devotional writing, culminating in William Drummond's <span class="italic">Urania</span> (1616) and John Donne's &#145;La corona&#146; and &#145;Holy Sonnets&#146;  (Roche, 155). Lok presumably drew early inspiration from the pioneering devotional poetry of his mother, Anne Locke; and his own sonnets may have likewise influenced Barnabe Barnes's <span class="italic">A Divine Century of Spirituall Sonnets</span> (1595) and Nicholas Breton's <span class="italic">The Soules Harmony</span> (1602). Self-consciously learned and rich in biblical allegory, Lok's poems provide &#145;a kaleidoscopic sense of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> impinging on the repentant soul&#146;. Despite their unevenness in quality, the best of Lok's work may still be usefully regarded as mediating &#145;between the assertiveness of Donne and the humility of Herbert&#146;  (Roche, 158). Lok also included &#145;Sundry psalmes of David&#146; in his <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span> volume and contributed a commendatory verse to his cousin Michael Cosworth's own versification of the psalms  (BL, Harley MS 6906). Lok was a showy metrical innovator and his <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span> was prefaced by a pair of dedicatory poems to Queen Elizabeth which are &#145;two of the most elaborately numerological poems&#146; to be found in Elizabethan poetry  (Roche, 164). Despite his literary effusions, Lok remains a poignant example of how the pursuit of court patronage through poetic dedications sometimes led only to destitution and despair.<br>
