<span class="headword">Pryce,  Maurice Henry Lecorney</span>  (1913&#150;2003), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born at 7 Clyde Road, Croydon, Surrey, on 24 January 1913, the son of William John Pryce, civil servant, and his wife, Hortense Elvire, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lecorney. His father, who was born in Swansea, half Welsh and half English, had taken a degree in mathematics at University College, Cardiff, where he was subsequently briefly a lecturer; in his early years he had hoped to become a theoretical physicist (and passed this enthusiasm on to his son), but family and financial pressures led him to become a civil servant, first at the Patent Office and eventually at the Ministry of Aircraft Production. His mother came from Argentan in Normandy, and because the family spoke French at home and he spent much time with his grandparents, Pryce often insisted that French was his first language; one of his scientific contemporaries later said that he spoke it with the accent of a Normandy peasant.<br>
<br>From 1923 to 1929 Pryce attended the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, where his scholastic ability became apparent and he held a king's scholarship. He always paid tribute to his mathematics teacher, Tudor F. Jones, who encouraged him to study beyond the normal syllabus and under whose guidance he won a state scholarship and open exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge. He began his studies there in 1930, having spent some time with a German family in Heidelberg to learn, at his father's insistence, &#145;the language of science&#146;. At Trinity he was recognized as one of the brightest mathematicians of his generation, taking first-class honours in both parts of the tripos. Subsequently he began research with W. H. Fowler on the theory of internal conversion in nuclear decay, and then with Max Born on field theory. In 1935 he was awarded a Commonwealth Fund fellowship to study at Princeton, where he worked with Wolfgang Pauli and John von Neumann and interacted socially and professionally with Einstein and the renowned mathematician G. H. Hardy. Having completed a PhD he returned to Cambridge in 1937 to take up a fellowship at Trinity College, where his research on the new field theory and on the two-neutrino theory of the photon greatly impressed Paul Dirac and other colleagues.<br>
<br>In 1939 Pryce married Susanne Margarete (Gritli) Born (1915&#150;2000), daughter of Max Born; they had three daughters and one son. Soon after their marriage they moved to Liverpool, where he had accepted a readership in theoretical physics in the department headed by James Chadwick. During the early stages of the Second World War he worked on the feasibility and internal mechanics of the atomic bomb, but was so horrified by his results that he decided not to be involved in further work on this project. At that time radar was considered a higher wartime priority and in 1941 he was directed to work at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. There he made seminal contributions to the design of microwave components. He also provided the critical analysis of the way in which radio waves might follow the curvature of the earth, accounting for the way in which the Germans were able to use this method to guide their bombers to targets in the midlands. Fred Hoyle, who worked with Pryce at Cambridge and at the Admiralty Signals Establishment, described this work as &#145;the most awesome piece of mathematical virtuosity I ever saw&#146;  (Hoyle, 93). Later in the war, after a refusal to work on the atomic bomb, Pryce joined the atomic energy team in Montreal concerned with the design of nuclear reactors. He was later responsible with others for the design of the British experimental Pile 0 reactor built at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell in 1947&#150;8.<br>
<br>Pryce returned to Cambridge in 1945 but shortly afterwards moved to Oxford, where the Wykeham chair, which had been held since its inception in 1900 by Sir John Townsend with no statutory retiring age, had been reallocated to theoretical physics. It was a bold appointment for someone aged only thirty-two (who looked so much younger than his years that soon after his arrival in Oxford, while drinking in a pub, he was mistaken by the proctors for an undergraduate). Once in Oxford he rapidly built up a large group of research students, many returning from war service. Several of these went on to make important contributions to the subject (six were subsequently elected fellows of the Royal Society), and two in particular, Anatole Abragam and J. C. Ward, were reckoned by Pryce to be much cleverer than himself. He created an effective department with a regular series of lectures and seminars and a journal club, and encouraged members of the group to spread their interests widely across different aspects of theoretical physics. Thus important contributions were made in the areas of field theory, nuclear structure, statistical mechanics, and magnetism. Pryce's own interests focused on the study of magnetic resonance, a new technique made possible by the wartime radar developments which was being actively pursued in the Clarendon Laboratory by Brebis Bleaney and others. In addition, following the arrest on charges of espionage of Klaus Fuchs, the head of the theoretical physics group at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Pryce served part-time as acting head of that group until a new head was appointed. His breadth of knowledge and interests made him almost uniquely qualified for this role.<br>
<br>In 1954 Pryce moved to Bristol University as H. O. Wills professor and head of the physics department in succession to Nevill Mott. In spite of the success of his research group in Oxford, Pryce had become frustrated by the constraints on his position in the Clarendon Laboratory, where every administrative and financial decision was referred to Lord Cherwell as head. There was little money for research support and in particular only one other permanent position, so that several outstanding colleagues on short-term appointments had moved to other universities. At Bristol he had major administrative duties as head of a large laboratory and he carried these out most effectively. However, his research began to suffer, and although he continued to work on magnetism, particularly the Jahn&#150;Teller effect, the number of his research students and his output of research papers declined rapidly. In fact his research output never recovered and throughout the latter part of his career he published little. Nevertheless he was the most stimulating critic of others' work and could give useful advice across the whole range of physics. He could, however, be a harsh critic and many colleagues, particularly junior ones, found his interventions at seminars upsetting.<br>
<br>During his time at Bristol Pryce's marriage ran into problems, and it ended in divorce in 1959. In 1961 he married, second, Freda Mary Kinsey (<i>d</i>. 1989), the former wife of a scientific colleague he had known in Cambridge and in Canada. Driven in part by personal and financial considerations he made a somewhat surprising move in 1964 to the position of distinguished professor of physics at the University of Southern California. He had been promised the resources to build there a new first-class department of physics, but these did not materialize in the way he had anticipated and he was unable to mould the situation as he wished. He therefore moved again in 1968 to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he spent the rest of his life. He proved an assiduous and hard-working member of that department, teaching and providing guidance to others in their research, but he published very little. After retirement in 1978 he continued to play an active role, although he was deeply affected by the death of his second wife. For the last four years of his life he was confined to hospital, incapacitated by osteoporosis-induced bone fracture and subsequent infection.<br>
<br>Pryce was one of the most gifted British theoretical physicists of his generation, working in the 1930s, when quantum mechanics was in its infancy, with many of the great scientists who had carried forward that revolution. His wartime work both in radar and in atomic energy was highly important. The research group which he built in Oxford after the war was a model for such departments. Given this background his subsequent career must be regarded as a disappointment, as he himself sometimes said. He regretted that he had accepted appointments which required a great deal of administrative effort to the detriment of his research. Nevertheless his final years at the University of British Columbia were some of his happiest, where he could play the role of elder statesman and mentor to many colleagues. He died in Vancouver on 24 July 2003, and was survived by the four children of his first marriage.<br>
