<span class="headword">Temple,  James</span>  (1606&#150;<em>c.</em>1674), <span class="occ">regicide</span>, was the only surviving son of Sir Alexander Temple (<i>c</i>.1582&#150;1629) of Etchingham in Sussex, and his first wife, Mary Penyston, daughter of John Somer of Kent. Alexander Temple was MP for Sussex in 1625&#150;6. James Temple was educated at Lincoln's Inn from 1622, although his attendance was irregular, and he was not called to the bar. His absence may have been caused, in part, by his participation in the duke of Buckingham's fateful military campaign to the island of R&eacute; in 1627, during which his elder brother was killed. Before April 1629 he married his stepsister Mary, daughter of John Busbridge of Etchingham, Sussex. They had five sons and a daughter. In the years following the death of his father in 1629 Temple forged friendships with many future parliamentarians, such as Sir Thomas Pelham, one of the most prominent puritan grandees in Sussex, with whom Temple and his family lived in the early 1640s. Upon the outbreak of civil war, Temple was made captain of a troop of horse under his uncle, William Fiennes, Viscount Saye and Sele, and subsequently served as captain of Tilbury Fort, a position which his father had earlier held. His most significant military contribution, however, occurred in Sussex, where he served on parliament's county committee, and where, as governor of Bramber Castle, he played a prominent part in the defence of the town against royalist troops. After the introduction of the New Model Army in 1645, he served as governor of Arundel Castle.<br>
<br>Temple was returned to parliament as a recruiter MP for Bramber in September 1645, and quickly emerged as a supporter of the political independents. He was among the members who fled to the safety of the army in the wake of the presbyterian disturbances in the summer of 1647, and thereafter played a prominent part in attempts to undermine the work of the presbyterians, not least in terms of policy in Ireland. He was nominated as a parliamentary commissioner for Munster in late 1647, although he may never have left England, where his services were certainly valuable in 1648 when Tilbury Fort assumed a position of strategic importance during the second civil war in Essex.<br>
<br>After Pride's Purge in December 1648 Temple quickly emerged as an opponent of negotiated settlement with the king, and was named to the high court of justice to try Charles I. He attended every day of the trial and signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. In the months after the execution of the king he played an active part in the work of parliament, not least on the committee for plundered ministers, although he also remained occupied by his work as governor of Tilbury. During late 1649 and early 1650, however, suspicions began to emerge regarding his financial propriety, as well as his work as guardian of the Catholic Sir Charles Shelley, heir to one of Sussex's most prominent recusant families. His fall from favour eventually resulted in his removal as governor of Tilbury, in September 1650, following allegations of mismanagement, and thereafter he played little part in Westminster affairs. He sat in none of the parliaments of the protectorate, and probably opposed the Cromwellian regime. When he returned to Westminster during the brief restoration of the Rump in 1659, it was as a republican sympathizer, albeit one opposed to the army.<br>
<br>Temple probably absented himself from parliament after the readmission of those members who had been removed at Pride's Purge, and as a regicide almost certainly feared for his safety after the return of Charles II. He fled from London, travelling under an alias, but was arrested in Warwickshire in mid-June 1660. He was held prisoner in the Tower until being tried along with the other regicides in the following October. At his trial he acknowledged having signed the death warrant, but claimed to have played little part in the deliberations, and even the prosecuting counsel admitted that &#145;there are some worse than he&#146;, although he also added that &#145;he is bad enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1217). Having surrendered himself according to the proclamation of 4 June, however, Temple was able to plead for his life, and so avoided execution. Subsequently, in 1662 when a bill was prepared to allow the remaining regicides to be executed he appeared before the House of Lords and submitted a petition in which he offered an elaborate excuse for his role in the death of Charles I. He claimed that he had been urged by two royalists, Stephen Goffe and Henry Hammond, not to refuse to participate in the trial, in order that he could gain intelligence on the work of the commissioners and &#145;from time to time to give them an account&#146;. He also claimed to have &#145;often applied himself to that cruel tyrant and usurper Cromwell with tears in his eyes, begging of him not to bring such a blot of bloody stain upon the Protestants as to execute his sacred majesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 156). Temple further suggested that his favour to the royal cause was the reason for his fall from power in the early 1650s. Although an implausible tale, he nevertheless received support from a number of royalists, but to no avail. He was transferred to a prison on Jersey in 1662, and probably died there some time around 1674.<br>
