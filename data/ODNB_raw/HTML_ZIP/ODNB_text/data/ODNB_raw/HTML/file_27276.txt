<span class="headword">Thompson,  Samuel</span>  (1766&#150;1837), <span class="occ">a founder of the Freethinking Christians</span>, born in Aldgate, London, on 7 June 1766, was the son of Samuel King Thompson, victualler, of the Bell, Church Row, Houndsditch, and his wife, Catherine. He was educated at Christ's Hospital (1774&#150;80), after which he was apprenticed to a watchmaker in Whitechapel. Before he was twenty he married, on 27 May 1786, Ann Kilbinton, and set up in business for himself. Their two children died in infancy. He was fond of society and a good singer, and his business did not prosper. He left the watch trade for a wine and spirit business in East Smithfield. His wife's death in 1789 turned him to religion; on 25 December 1793 he married Mary Fletcher (1777&#150;1850), took seriously to business, became eminent as a distiller and dealer in spirits, and regulated his trade by strict measures against drunkenness and loose language. Up to this point he was an Anglican; a casual hearing of Elhanan Winchester, the universalist, led him to become a member of his congregation in Parliament Court, Bishopsgate, in 1794. He was made deacon on 16 August 1795, and &#145;set apart&#146; with three others for &#145;public service&#146; on 8 January 1796. He was afternoon preacher, and distinguished himself by arguing against deists at open-air meetings, but soon quarrelled with William Vidler, Winchester's successor, on a point of pastoral authority. With twenty-one others he seceded on 19 November 1798, the schism being primarily a protest against a one-man ministry and the payment of preachers.<br>
<br>On Christmas day 1798 the seceders opened a meeting-room at 38 Old Change, London, and at once announced their rejection of the doctrine of the Trinity, retaining, however, for some time, the doctrine of Christ's pre-existence. They also rejected baptism and the eucharist, as well as public singing and prayer. Their rules of membership and exclusion were strict, and strictly enforced. They took the name of the Church of God, and Thompson was elected an elder in March 1799. In March 1804 large audiences were attracted to their meetings by their public replies to Paine's <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span>. They were popularly known as the Freethinking Christians.<br>
<br>Thompson left business in April 1806, retiring with about &pound;300 a year to Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, for the education of his four sons and eight daughters. Contention in his church brought him back to London; he resumed the spirit business on Holborn Hill at midsummer 1807. In December his followers advertised that they were going to &#145;inquire&#146; into the existence of &#145;a being called the Devil&#146;. Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, called the attention of the authorities to these proceedings in an unlicensed conventicle. Thompson and four others were cited (5 February 1808) by the city marshal. They applied for a licence as protestant dissenters, and obtained it with some difficulty. In 1810 they built a meeting-house, on a short lease, in Jewin Crescent, London, soon started a magazine, and made attacks on the Unitarian leaders Thomas Belsham and Robert Aspland. In December 1813 Thompson, regarding marriage as purely a civil act and the Anglican marriage service as &#145;idolatrous&#146;, suggested that, on occasions of marriage, a protest should be delivered to the officiating clergyman and advertised in the newspapers. This policy was carried out (10 June 1814) on the marriage of Thompson's eldest daughter, Mary Ann, herself active among the Freethinking Christians, to William Coates; it was persistently continued, occasionally causing scandalous scenes, as at the marriage of a younger daughter, Julietta, to John Dobell in 1823, until the grievance was remedied by the marriage act of 1836.<br>
<br>In 1821 there was a small secession, led by William Stevens, of members dissatisfied with Thompson's personal rule and dictatorial manner, meeting in Moorfields and claiming to be the true &#145;church of God&#146;. In 1831 Thompson's friends built a meeting-house on freehold property in St John's Square, Clerkenwell. William Coates was their leader; Thompson, who was now living at Plaistow, Essex, being reduced to inactivity by ill health. He finally retired from business in 1831 (his son-in-law had long been the managing partner), and, at his own request, was released from &#145;public service&#146; by his church. He was still, however, involved in its disputes. In 1834, having made up his old quarrel with Robert Aspland, he published a series of papers in Aspland's magazine, the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, on the &#145;unity and exclusiveness of the church of God&#146;. This was done &#145;without the previous consent of the church, as required by their laws&#146;. He asked and obtained indemnity; but the dispute continued, and Thompson, though claiming to be &#145;the founder of the church, God's agent&#146;, was served with notice of expulsion. He was, in fact, expelled in December, but not before he had rallied his immediate following and been elected elder of another, and the only &#145;real&#146;, &#145;church of God&#146;. The revolt against Thompson had no continuance. The original society became extinct in 1851, having survived its several provincial branches.<br>
<br>Thompson died at Reigate, Surrey, on 20 November 1837, and was buried in the graveyard of the General Baptist chapel at Ditchling, Sussex. An epitaph, his own composition, gives the articles of his creed, and adds &#145;The good loved him, and the base hated, because they feared&#146;. The most significant of his publications was <span class="italic">Evidences of Revealed Religion</span> (1812), which reached its fourth edition in 1842.<br>
