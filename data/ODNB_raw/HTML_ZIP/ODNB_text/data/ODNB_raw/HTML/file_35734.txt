<span class="headword">Rh&#375;s <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Rees]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (1840&#150;1915), <span class="occ">Celtic scholar</span>, was born John Rees at Aberceiro-fach, Ponterwyd, Cardiganshire, on 21 June 1840, the eldest son of Hugh Rees (<i>d</i>. 1886), a farmer and lead miner, and his wife, Jane Mason (<i>d</i>. 1863). Rees received his early education at Bryn-chwyth, Pantyffynnon, and Ponterwyd, moving in 1855 to the newly opened British School at Penllwyn, near Aberystwyth, where he was a pupil teacher. After a course of study at the Bangor Normal College (1860&#150;61), he was appointed headmaster of the British School at Rhos-y-bol, Anglesey, in January 1861. In 1865 he was introduced by Chancellor James Williams, of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy, Anglesey, to Dr Charles Williams, principal of Jesus College, Oxford. After a brief oral examination, Rees was offered a place at Jesus College and entered in October 1865. He took a second class in classical moderations in 1867, and a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1869. Towards the end of 1869 he was elected fellow at Merton College. During his time at Oxford he spent his summer vacations studying abroad and visited Paris, Heidelberg, Leipzig, and G&ouml;ttingen; he matriculated at Leipzig in 1871. While at Leipzig, Rh&#375;s attended the lectures of, among others, Georg Curtius and August Leskien, and his interest in philology and linguistics was fired.<br>
<br>In 1871 Rh&#375;s, who adopted the Welsh spelling of his name in early adulthood, returned to Wales as HM inspector of schools for the counties of Flint and Denbigh and made his home at Rhyl. During this time he began publishing articles on Celtic grammar and contributed important articles on the glosses in the Luxembourg manuscript to the first three volumes of the <span class="italic">Revue Celtique</span> (1870). A course of lectures delivered at Aberystwyth in 1874, published later under the title <span class="italic">Lectures on Welsh Philology</span> (1877), established his reputation as a Celtic scholar of the first rank; and when the Jesus professorship of Celtic was founded at Oxford in 1877 he was elected first professor. At the same time he was made an honorary fellow of Jesus College, and in 1881 he became official fellow and bursar. He was bursar until 1895, when he was elected principal of the college, succeeding Dr Hugo Harper.<br>
<br>Rh&#375;s was first and foremost a scholar, and, although he served as member of the hebdomadal council from 1906 to 1911, the administrative side of academic life had little attraction for him. However, for forty years he worked tirelessly in the cause of educational and social progress. He served on Lord Aberdare's departmental committee on Welsh education (1881), and was secretary to Sir John Bridge's commission on the tithe agitation in Wales (1887) and to the royal commission on Sunday closing in Wales (1889). He was also a member of the royal commission on land tenure in Wales (1893), of the royal commission on university education in Ireland (1901), of Sir Thomas Raleigh's commission on the Welsh university and its constituent colleges (1907), and of Chief Baron Palles's commission for a national university of Ireland (1908). At the time of his death (1915) he was chairman of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and Monmouthshire. From its formation in May 1886, Rh&#375;s served as president of the Dafydd ap Gwilym Society at Oxford. He was also chairman of the council of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, and was awarded the society medal in 1912. In recognition of his public services Rh&#375;s was knighted in 1907, and in 1911 was sworn of the privy council. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Edinburgh in 1893, and that of DLitt from the University of Wales in 1902.<br>
<br>As a scholar, Rh&#375;s combined with industry and learning a singularly active, reconstructive imagination. Although his principal interest was in Celtic and Welsh philology, his researches took him into many fields. Beginning as a grammarian, he resumed and continued his linguistic and epigraphic investigations in <span class="italic">The Outlines of the Phonology of Manx Gaelic</span> (1894), and in a series of papers read to the British Academy. He made a substantial contribution to the history of the Celts in Britain and travelled widely across western Europe, studying Celtic inscriptions, particularly the Ogam inscriptions of Wales and Ireland. His historical works included <span class="italic">Celtic Britain</span> (1879), &#145;Studies in early Irish history&#146; in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Welsh People</span> (with D. Brynmor-Jones, 1900), and &#145;Celtae and Galli&#146; in <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span> (1905). To the literature of the history of religion, archaeology, ethnology, and folklore he contributed his Hibbert lectures, published as <span class="italic">On the Origin and Growth of Religion, as Illustrated by Celtic Heathendom</span> (1888), his presidential address to the anthropological section of the British Association (1900), his Rhind lectures at Edinburgh entitled <span class="italic">The Early Ethnology of the British Isles</span> (1889), <span class="italic">Studies on the Arthurian Legend</span> (1891), <span class="italic">Celtic Folklore: Welsh and Manx</span> (1901), and numerous articles in the publications of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion. Almost his only excursion into the field of literary research is represented by &#145;The englyn: the origin of the Welsh englyn and the kindred metres&#146; (vol. 18 of the <span class="italic">Cymmrodor</span>, 1905). He also collaborated with J. Gwenogvryn Evans in the preparation of three volumes of texts of early Welsh manuscripts, <span class="italic">The Text of the Mabinogion</span> (<span class="roman">Red Book of Hergest</span>) (1887); <span class="italic">The Text of the Bruts</span> (<span class="roman">Red Book of Hergest</span>) (1890); <span class="italic">The Text of the Book of Llan Dav</span> (Gwysaney MS) (1893).<br>
<br>Rh&#375;s married Elspeth Hughes-Davies (<i>d</i>. 1911) of Llanberis on 6 August 1872; they had two daughters, Myfanwy and Olwen. He died at The Lodgings, Jesus College, Oxford, on 17 December 1915, and was buried on 23 December at Holywell cemetery, Oxford. The British Academy, of which he became fellow in 1903, founded the Sir John Rh&#375;s Memorial Lecture to be delivered annually in his memory; the first lecture, delivered by his disciple John Morris Jones, gave a full bibliography of his works. The breadth of knowledge and scholarship exhibited in his numerous publications in the fields of philology, archaeology, folklore, and ethnology serve as testimony of Rh&#375;s's great contribution to Celtic learning. In these fields he was foremost among the scholars of his time, and his pioneering studies provided a firm foundation for future Celtic scholarship and research for many decades.<br>
