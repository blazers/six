<span class="headword">Women agents on active service in France</span>  (<em>act. </em>1942&#150;1944) <span class="occ"></span>were trained in secrecy from the spring of 1942 to work abroad as agents of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), F section, despite much opposition to the use of women in this field, because of a shortage of suitable men available for the work. Some women were already expert wireless operators, a skill essential for field agents who had to transmit regular requests for supplies from Britain. They also made unobtrusive couriers, although many were young and often very attractive. SOE agents were not spies. Instead they were sent to conquered countries, where their task was to enable their &#145;organizer&#146; and local resistance groups to carry out sabotage and later armed resistance to the German, Italian, or Japanese forces of occupation.<br>
<br>Shortly after SOE's inception in July 1940 a chance encounter between the head of SOE and the commandant of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), later known as the Women's Transport Service, brought in over a third of FANY's numbers to join other civilians, servicemen, and servicewomen on SOE's many staffs, whose work embraced numerous countries. FANY now gave cover to, and produced, most of the fifty or so women agents sent to France by SOE, fifteen of whom came from the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Although FANY was a uniformed service, those in it were classed as civilians and could thus both travel abroad and carry arms, which were forbidden at that time to members of the women's forces. As General de Gaulle's own secret service, the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action, was hostile to SOE, eleven or more Frenchwomen (a few from the French Women's Army), most trained by SOE, worked in liaison with de Gaulle in what was known as the R&eacute;publique Fran&ccedil;aise (RF) section. The mainly British remainder were employed by F section, the French service independent of de Gaulle, which had its early headquarters in Baker Street, London. Of the nearly four hundred F section agents working in France, around forty were women, although about ninety were trained for service there. A few other SOE sections also worked in France, mostly dealing with escape lines. The secret services of many other powers, both friendly and hostile, were also active in France.<br>
<br>SOE women agents came from all walks of society, from a princess born in the Kremlin to a shopgirl; their ages and characters were also highly various. However, they all had in common immense courage and intense patriotism. Usually their patriotism was for both Britain and France, as many had at least one French parent, spoke French fluently, or were familiar with France. The risks of their work were clearly explained in early selection interviews: they would have to work hard both by day and by night; life would be strenuous, lonely, and precarious, and they would always have to be alert to danger; if captured, they could face brutal interrogation, imprisonment, and probably death. Nevertheless, these women were willing to make this sacrifice and, secretly, few expected to return alive.<br>
<br>Chillingly, for the women of F section this expectation was all too often fulfilled. The figures tell their own story. All the women of RF section survived the war. Perhaps it was because they were more truly French, better protected in their own land, or perhaps because they arrived in 1944 only months before (or even after) the allied landings on D-day: even so, Alix D'Unienville was captured but escaped, and Marguerite Petitjean got away only by a whisker, the enemy hot on her heels, as she fled over the Pyrenees. The story of the F section women was very different. Of their number, at least twenty were imprisoned (one for only a day) and thirteen never returned. Of two others, working for SOE but not trained by it, Madame Wimille made an audacious escape, but <a href="#cosubject_72575">Sonia Olschanesky [<i>see below</i>]</a> ended in the crematorium at Natzweiler.<br>
<br>It is believed that it took between five and ten years to train a Russian agent. SOE could not afford to be so generous, and the longest training period given to a woman appears to have been about nine months for the training of a very few as wireless operators from scratch; the average was five to six months and, when agents were urgently needed, even less. Training usually took place at large, requisitioned country mansions, well away from prying eyes. Agents used to joke that SOE stood for &#145;Stately 'Omes of England&#146;. For F section weaker entrants were sifted out at Wanborough Manor, where training in security, exercise, and methods was given. Then came survival and weapons training in Scotland, parachuting at Tatton Park, and various undercover courses in forgery, burglary, and other necessary activities at the finishing school in Beaulieu Abbey. Here new identities were created, and the women also faced gruelling evasion and interrogation tests. Wireless operators additionally were trained at Thame Park. The success of the training can be measured by the fact that, of all the women agents captured in action, none appear to have given away to the Germans any sensitive information.<br>
<br>Their training complete, the women agents were ready to be sent to France by felucca or submarine, to be landed by Lysander or Hudson aircraft, or to be dropped by parachute often from a Halifax (with other supplies), hoping that they would not be injured on arrival, met by a reception party of Germans (as once happened), or find themselves stranded, lost, and alone in the dark with no contacts. In this, as in the skill and courage that they displayed throughout the difficulties and traumas of their careers in France, it is little wonder that many of these women agents won high awards. Three gained the George Cross (two posthumously).<br>
<br>The fiery <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38046/', "Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo, n&#233;e Bushell (1921&#150;1945)")</script>, reputed to be the best shot in SOE, a beautiful widow of twenty-three, parachuted twice into France as a courier. The first visit was short, to a network around Rouen which could not be revived. Three days after arriving in France for the second time in 1944, to assist the maquis in sabotage around Limoges, she and her two companions were caught in a German ambush. Her colleagues managed to get away, but, injuring her ankle, Szabo could not, and was captured. When interrogation could extract nothing from her, she was later imprisoned and eventually shot at the concentration camp at Ravensbr&uuml;ck on 5 February 1945. In addition to being appointed MBE and awarded the Croix de Guerre, she also received a posthumous George Cross.<br>
<br>Perhaps the best-known of the agents was a spirited thirty-year-old brunette, Odette Marie C&eacute;line Sansom, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brailly (1912&#150;1995) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58213/', "Hallowes, Odette Marie C&#233;line")</script>], the French-born wife of an Englishman. She landed near Cassis in November 1942 and became a courier to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30930/', "Peter Morland Churchill (1909&#150;1972)")</script>. Later they were arrested by a German posing as a friend. Under torture Odette tried to exonerate Churchill. Finally, after a period of solitary confinement in Ravensbr&uuml;ck, she was released by the commandant, who believed her story that Churchill was the prime minister's relation and that she was Peter's wife (which she became in reality in 1947). She was awarded the George Cross and was appointed MBE and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, the only one of the three George Cross recipients to survive the war.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45793/', "Princess Noor Inayat Khan (1914&#150;1944)")</script> was the third female SOE agent awarded the George Cross (she was also appointed MBE and awarded the Croix de Guerre). The least likely of British agents, of Indian and American parentage, at twenty-eight she was shy and unworldly. She had trained as a wireless operator in the WAAF, and in the autumn of 1942 was approached by SOE, which was desperate for operators, whose survival rate was then only about six weeks before capture. Rushed through SOE training Khan found herself the only operator left in Paris following the destruction of the Prosper network in 1943. Refusing to save herself, she kept in constant touch with Britain. Finally betrayed, she was arrested, unfortunately with her wireless, messages, and codes intact. Twice she tried to escape; but she was imprisoned in chains in solitary confinement, and was finally shot at Dachau on 12 or 13 September 1944 with the word &#145;libert&eacute;&#146; on her lips.<br>
<br>Two agents gained the George Medal. Both were couriers, and something more. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104083/', "Nancy Grace Augusta Wake")</script> was an energetic New Zealand-born Australian with a strong personality. She twice worked in France, initially from her home in Marseilles, where she was known to the resistance as White Mouse. After being captured and interrogated she was rescued from prison by her friends. Then, aged thirty-two, she parachuted back into France in April 1944, and became virtually the head of 7000 maquisards in the Corr&egrave;ze, whom she led with verve and by example; she returned safely to Britain in September 1944. Known by her English name, 29-year-old Christine Granville was a Polish countess both by birth and marriage [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67777/', "Gizycka, Countess Krystyna (1915&#150;1952)")</script>], and was exceedingly beautiful, attractive, and tempestuous. Constantly on the move in the Vercors and elsewhere, she was an accomplished subversive agent who had many adventures. Finally, by a trick, she rescued her organizer from prison at Digne just before the allies arrived. She was also appointed MBE and chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. She was murdered in London in 1952.<br>
<br>Given the American Distinguished Service Cross and created MBE, <a name="cosubject_72572"></a><span class="headword">Virginia Hall</span>  (1906&#150;1982)<span class="occ"></span>, was an outstanding agent and one of three Americans who helped SOE. The others were Giliana Gerson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Balmaceda (<i>b</i>. 1913), a Chilean by birth and an actress&#151;which enabled her to spend three weeks of May and June 1941 in Vichy and Lyons, collecting useful travel information and documents&#151;and Elizabeth Devereux Reynolds (1917&#150;1981X3), possessor of a fabulous memory, whose career as a courier was cut short by arrest but who was later released by the allies from her French prison. Virginia Hall, as unobtrusive as her unusual height and artificial foot (christened Cuthbert) allowed, went into France twice. She worked in Vichy in 1941, and later in Lyons, as a foreign correspondent to the <span class="italic">New York Post</span>, and fleetingly the <span class="italic">Chicago Times</span>; secretly, however, she was organizing many new SOE networks, until Gestapo suspicions forced her to escape over the Pyrenees in 1942. In 1944 she returned to France, to the Creuse and Haute Loire, having trained privately as a wireless operator, working for the American Office of Strategic Services.<br>
<br>The sometimes colourful, but usually serious, secretive, and hardworking, <a name="cosubject_70520"></a><span class="headword">Yvonne Claire Rudellat</span>  (1897&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span> was one of the first SOE F section women to go to France, in July 1942. An apparently frail grandmother of chameleon personality, she helped to create a network allied to the unfortunate Prosper network in Paris. Her success was instrumental in convincing SOE to continue using women agents in France. She was shot in the head in a car chase in June 1943, convinced the Gestapo of her loss of memory, but died, unrecognized, from typhus, about 24 April 1945 in Belsen after its liberation. She too was appointed MBE, and received the Croix de Guerre.<br>
<br>Of the eleven women agents who arrived in France down the short ladder of the Lysander aircraft, eight were captured, often within months of landing. Many of the arrivals were masterminded by Henri D&eacute;ricourt, a very suspect agent. The Germans too, of course, may have found such landings more easily traceable. <a name="cosubject_72573"></a><span class="headword">Vera Eugenie Leigh</span>  (1903&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, still beautiful at forty, was one of these agents. She became a courier between Paris and the Yonne river, and was arrested in 1943. Another was the English-looking, intrepid 28-year-old <a name="cosubject_67704"></a><span class="headword">Diana Hope Rowden</span>  (1915&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, formerly in the WAAF, who was a courier in the Dijon area and was arrested at almost the same time. Leigh and Rowden went through the usual interrogation by Gestapo at the notorious Avenue Foch, and eventually in July 1944 they were moved to Natzweiler concentration camp. There they were joined by the gallant 24-year-old <a name="cosubject_72574"></a><span class="headword">Andr&eacute;e Raymonde Borrel</span>  (1919&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, a French shopgirl, who had previously worked for the resistance before being parachuted back in 1942 to be a courier for Prosper in Paris and who had been arrested only a month before. A fourth in their number was <a name="cosubject_72575"></a><span class="headword">Sonia Olschanesky</span>  (1923&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, a French-born daughter of Russian parents, employed by SOE as a courier in contact with Paris, though she had not been trained by SOE. All four were detained in a cell together in Natzweiler after a hot afternoon in the train on 6 July 1944. That evening they were escorted one by one to the camp crematorium, where they were given a lethal injection of phenol and their bodies burnt. Both Borrel and Rowden were appointed MBE and awarded the Croix de Guerre, but Rowden's appointment as MBE, being posthumous, was later withdrawn.<br>
<br>Dachau concentration camp was the venue for an appointment with death for another four agents. <a name="cosubject_67693"></a><span class="headword">Yolande Elsa Maria Beekman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Untern&auml;hrer]</span></span>  (1911&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, sent as a wireless operator to St Quentin in 1943, a cheerful, reliable woman, was betrayed in her lodgings at a cafe. She had landed by Lysander, like the dreamy Noor Inayat Khan, whom she met at Dachau. Their companions at dawn on 12 or 13 September 1944 were the ebullient <a name="cosubject_72576"></a><span class="headword">Elaine Sophie Plewman</span>  (1917&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, sent by parachute to act as courier in Marseilles, and the modest <a name="cosubject_72577"></a><span class="headword">Madeleine Damerment</span>  (1917&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, intended for a courier, who had the ill luck to be captured by the Germans as soon as her parachute hit the ground. Following a night isolated in a windowless cell, the four women were taken to the sand-strewn crematorium yard at Dachau, where, kneeling hand in hand, two by two, they were shot neatly through the back of the head. All received the Croix de Guerre; Damerment was also appointed chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50580"></a><span class="headword">Lilian Verna Rolfe</span>  (1914&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span> was an imperturbable thirty-year-old woman who was set down by Lysander in April 1944 and destined for the area around Orl&eacute;ans. Three months later she was arrested by accident: the Germans were making a sweep of the area before evacuation, and discovered to their surprise that they had caught an SOE wireless operator. She was shot at Ravensbr&uuml;ck on 5 February 1945. She received the Croix de Guerre and was appointed MBE. Her fate at Ravensbr&uuml;ck was shared by the fiercely patriotic <a name="cosubject_72578"></a><span class="headword">Denise Madeleine Bloch</span>  (1916&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>, of Jewish parentage. She also arrived by Lysander a few months before D-day in June 1944. Bloch was to act as a wireless operator for a network around Nantes, with instructions to damage communications in this vital area. Captured during a Gestapo raid at her lodging house, she was also shot at Ravensbr&uuml;ck on 5 February 1945. She was appointed chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. A shy doctor's wife, <a name="cosubject_67701"></a><span class="headword">Cecily Margot Lefort <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>MacKenzie]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>, landed by Lysander in June 1943 and was employed as a courier in south-eastern France. Captured and later imprisoned in Ravensbr&uuml;ck, she probably died in the nearby Judenlager extermination camp in February 1945. She received the Croix de Guerre. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103060/', "Eileen Nearne (1921&#150;2010)")</script>, at twenty-two an energetic and resourceful wireless operator, already experienced in work at one of the SOE listening stations in Britain (where messages to and from agents were sent and received), went by Lysander to work in Paris. She was caught at her set and amazingly, even after torture, persuaded the Gestapo that she was just a little shopgirl who knew nothing. Nevertheless, she was sent to Ravensbr&uuml;ck and afterwards, while being moved, effected a miraculous escape and was rescued by the advancing Americans. She was appointed MBE and received the Croix de Guerre.<br>
<br>Three Lysander passengers survived without being captured. Two landed in early 1943. <a name="cosubject_72579"></a><span class="headword">Julienne Aisner</span>  (1900&#150;1947)<span class="occ"></span>, intended as a courier, was eventually to run a bar in Paris as part of an escape route. Customers causing grave suspicions decided her to return to Britain in haste in 1944. So too the discreet Francine Agazarian (1913&#150;1999), a frantically busy courier for Prosper, returned worn out three months after her arrival in Paris. The Mauritian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93513/', "Lise de Baissac (1905&#150;2004)")</script> was very capable and had a cool head. She went to France twice. After arriving by parachute she single-handedly organized a network around Poitiers and helped nearby circuits in 1942&#150;3. Recalled after the debacle of Prosper, she later returned by Lysander in 1944 and helped her organizer brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31019/', "Claude de Baissac")</script> in Normandy during and after D-day, finally meeting the advancing Americans in her FANY uniform. She was appointed to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and MBE, and received the Croix de Guerre. The Baissacs were joined in May 1944 by the sweet-natured Phyllis Latour (<i>b</i>. 1921), who parachuted in as their much-needed and overworked wireless operator; despite her dangerous work, she too survived unscathed, and received the Croix de Guerre and was appointed MBE. Two others who arrived in France by parachute were less fortunate. Yvonne Baseden (<i>b</i>. 1922) worked as an efficient wireless operator in the Jura mountain area until she was captured and finally sent to Ravensbr&uuml;ck. Having contracted tuberculosis, she was fortunately evacuated by the Red Cross early in 1945. She was appointed MBE and received the Croix de Guerre. Sadder still was the case of another wireless operator, the small, dark, pretty <a name="cosubject_67695"></a><span class="headword">Muriel Tamara Byck</span>  (1918&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, of Jewish family, who died suddenly of meningitis at Romorantin on 23 May 1944, six weeks after landing.<br>
<br>Most notable among those who survived was the redoubtable <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99822/', "Pearl Witherington (1914&#150;2008)")</script>. Originally a courier in the Auvergne, she revived her ailing network after her organizer's capture, and eventually commanded an active maquis of over 3500 men. So effective were her &#145;modest capabilities&#146; that a German army of 18,000 preferred to surrender to the Americans rather than fall into the hands of her maquis. In addition to appointment as MBE and chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, she received the Croix de Guerre. Another survivor was the unobtrusive, rock-steady <a name="cosubject_67696"></a><span class="headword">(Beatrice) Yvonne Cormeau</span>  (1909&#150;1997)<span class="occ"></span>, who at thirty-three joined a network in Gascony as a wireless operator. Always on the move, she sent a record of 400 transmissions or more in thirteen months without a single miscode, and was always very careful of security. She was appointed MBE and chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was also awarded the Croix de Guerre. Marguerite Knight (1920&#150;2004) was a keen and competent courier in the Yonne at a confused and dangerous time in her network, who managed to survive unharmed, as did Sonya Esm&eacute;e Florence Butt (1924&#150;2014), one of the youngest couriers; Butt's looks belied her talents, as she also became the weapons training officer for the maquis around Le Mans. Knight received the Croix de Guerre and was appointed MBE; Butt was also appointed MBE. The elusive 27-year-old <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70522/', "Jacqueline Nearne")</script>, elder sister of Eileen (whose employment by SOE she opposed), went as courier to a huge south-western network in 1943 and had to be recalled fifteen months later, worn out by her constant travels. She received the Croix de Guerre, and was appointed MBE. Grey-haired <a name="cosubject_72580"></a><span class="headword">Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Le Chene</span>  (<em>b. </em>1887)<span class="occ"></span>, by far the oldest woman agent, arrived to be courier to her husband in the vast area around Clermont-Ferrand in October 1942. She returned to Britain exhausted ten months later. Two agents escaped over the Pyrenees on foot: lively, fair-haired, blue-eyed Anne-Marie Walters (1923&#150;1998), daughter of the deputy secretary-general of the League of Nations, had been a courier in Gascony with a price on her head (she was appointed MBE); and Odette Wilen (<i>b</i>. 1919), a part-trained wireless operator who found her network broken up almost before she had begun. Blanche Charlet (1893&#150;1985) had a short career as a courier at Lyons before she was captured, and then achieved the almost impossible by escaping from her French prison; winter foiled her attempt to flee over the Pyrenees and she left by another route. <a name="cosubject_67698"></a><span class="headword">Mary Katherine Herbert</span>  (1903&#150;1983)<span class="occ"></span> was a courier in the Gironde and also spent some time in a French prison, where her quick wits and knowledge of Arabic talked her out of Gestapo suspicions. Afterwards she remained in hiding until the end of the war, and married Claude de Baissac.<br>
<br>Four other SOE agents were in post when the allies swept over their areas: Yvonne Fontaine (1913&#150;1996), a careful courier, twice in France, latterly close to Paris; Madeleine Lavigne (1912&#150;1945), a short-lived courier in Limoges; Ginette Jullian (1917&#150;1962), a courier at Chartres; and Patricia Maureen (Paddy) O'Sullivan (1918&#150;1994), a part-trained wireless operator in Limoges to a pair of Mauritian brothers, all careful of security. O'Sullivan was appointed MBE and received the Croix de Guerre. There may have been other agents, but they disappeared, unrecognized.<br>
<br>When the war was over, SOE was ordered to close down on 15 January 1946 (some records give 30 June 1946), and many accounts were destroyed or lost. After the organization's hasty demise, many questions remained unanswered. How had decoders dangerously ignored missing security checks on captured agents' wireless transmissions? Why had lives been put at risk by trusting known or suspected double agents? By what right had the Secret Intelligence Service withheld intelligence gained from Ultra, thus needlessly sacrificing many agents' lives? And there were other controversies. SOE's success in France is in dispute. Measured by the impact of battles in the field, it probably had infinitesimal success. Some of its sabotage work was ineffective and provoked much savage reprisal against French civilians. On the other hand, its handful of agents caused major disruption to the German occupying forces, tying down or diverting much-needed police and soldiers, particularly directly before and after the north and south landings by the allies. It also gave hope, support, guidance, and supplies to the maquis and anti-German forces. Even General Eisenhower, the supreme allied commander, in a tribute to its efforts, stated that it &#145;played a very considerable part in our complete and final victory&#146;.<br>
<br>For its individuals, when hostilities ceased, it was left to Vera Atkins, the briefing and conducting officer of F section, to take a year travelling through Europe to discover the fates of those agents who did not come back&#151;most of whom she had known personally. It was through her efforts that the tragic details became known of those courageous ones who died. Both Britain and France owe a lasting debt of gratitude to the brave work of the SOE agents, and especially this small band of women, who hardened themselves to work and endure for between one and four years of German occupation, placing the freedom of their countries above their own, and whose survivors carried their nightmares with them for the rest of their lives.<br>
