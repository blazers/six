<span class="headword">Dryden, Sir  Henry Edward Leigh</span>, fourth baronet and seventh baronet  (1818&#150;1899), <span class="occ">archaeologist and antiquary</span>, was born on 17 August 1818 at Adlestrop, Gloucestershire, the eldest of the three children of the Revd Sir Henry Dryden, third baronet (1787&#150;1837), and Elizabeth (1782&#150;1851), daughter of the Revd Julius Hutchinson, of Woodhall Park, Hertfordshire, and Owlthorpe, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, where, according to Dr Butler, he &#145;didn't at all shine in academic subjects, but he was good at drawing&#146;  (Sargant, 86). He was nineteen and studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, when he inherited the baronetcy and its debts. In 1874 he enlarged the title by succeeding to that of his cousin Sir Edward Page-Turner, as seventh baronet. By then, however, he was a much-loved squire in Northamptonshire, where he was a deputy lieutenant and local magistrate and had been high sheriff in 1844 when Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited the county.<br>
<br>Sir Henry, as he was universally known, owed his popularity to a genial nature formed by his old-fashioned values, sharp yet kind wit, and notable eccentricity. He was scrupulous in observing the English Sunday and had a paternalistic view of Christian duty towards the community. He regularly practised with local church choirs, among which he introduced the Hullah-Wilhem method for teaching singing. He built schools for his neighbours, together with cottages and other vernacular buildings, and was the first chairman of Canons Ashby parish council. He had his clothes made in the villages, and dressed in an out-of-date fashion. In these outfits he would befriend tramps and recommend Canons Ashby House as a place to beg a meal; getting there by a short cut, he would astonish the subsequent caller by becoming his host.<br>
<br>Dryden acquired the nickname &#145;the Antiquary&#146; from his passion for exploring ancient churches, ruins, and other monuments, all of which he investigated with close attention to detail. His methods were truly archaeological, involving careful observation and recording by accurate drawing and measured survey. The exactness of his plans was notorious among contemporaries, who told how he had travelled 200 miles across France in order to check a half-inch discrepancy of measurement. His lifelong interest in history, archaeology, ecclesiology, and medieval architecture was characterized by thoroughness, which occasionally bordered upon the obsessive, such as setting the type for one of his publications. He deplored shoddy work, and condemned what he called the &#145;decadent and bastard type&#146; of heraldry which it was proposed to include in the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span> series.<br>
<br>Because Dryden collected information about many historic structures since destroyed or subsequently altered, his drawings and notes remain of value. Over 500 portfolios of plans, elevations, and other records survive, mostly as a gift to Northampton Public Library, where he helped to establish the town's museum and was its honorary curator of antiquities, costumes, and leather work. Together with letters exchanged with the leading authorities at the time, the material illustrates the wide range of his researches. These extended from British antiquities and sites of all ages to Scandinavian prehistory and the megaliths of Brittany, which he surveyed with the Revd William Collings Lukis FSA. He also worked in the Orkney and Shetland islands, in particular making measured drawings of St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney, which formed the basis of a published description (1868).<br>
<br>Dryden was made an honorary fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in recognition of his archaeological work in the north. He was president of the Oxford Archaeological Society, a member of the Peterborough Diocesan Church Building Association, and a founding vice-president of the architectural society for the archdeaconries of Northampton and Oakham, in whose journal he published various papers. He was a popular contributor to the annual series of Saturday evening talks at Northampton town hall, where his inevitable banter with the audience was eagerly looked forward to, in spite of the often abstruse subject matter. According to one observer, he was a restless speaker:<blockquote>pacing rapidly from one illustration to another: now sketching an old gable on a blackboard; now calling for someone to come up and try on some ancient armour, then giving measured details of medieval houses; then thanking God that there were no Radicals in those days. (Adkins, 4&#150;5)</blockquote>Dryden died at Canons Ashby House on 24 July 1899 after succumbing to septicaemia from gangrene of his right leg, which he had scratched three months earlier while working on the estate. His brother, Sir Alfred Erasmus Dryden (1821&#150;1912), succeeded him as baronet. Sir Henry's only child from his marriage on 24 January 1865 to Frances (1825&#150;1899), eldest daughter of the Revd Robert Tredcroft, prebendary of Chichester and rector of Tangmere, Sussex, was <a name="cosubject_59941"></a><span class="headword">Alice Dryden</span>  (1866&#150;1956), <span class="occ">historian</span>, who was born at Canons Ashby on 3 August 1866. She left the area shortly after her father's death and married John Marcon (<i>d</i>. 1928) on 6 April 1913, eventually settling in Oxford, where she died on 4 February 1956 at 7 Hamilton Road.<br>
<br>Alice inherited her father's sense of service, becoming an earnest worker for the Primrose League and founding the Northamptonshire Home Arts and Industries Association, through which she sought to revive local lacemaking. She also had his bent for historical research, revising Mrs Bury Palliser's <span class="italic">History of Lace</span> (1902) and compiling a series of county studies, beginning with <span class="italic">Memorials of Old Northamptonshire</span> in 1903. Her publication of medieval manuscripts on <span class="italic">The Art of Hunting</span> (1908) reissued some of Sir Henry's work.<br>
