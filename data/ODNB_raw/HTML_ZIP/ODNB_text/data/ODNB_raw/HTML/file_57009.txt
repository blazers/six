<span class="headword">Greig,  Gavin</span>  (1856&#150;1914), <span class="occ">folksong collector and teacher</span>, was born on 10 February 1856 in the North Lodge, Parkhill estate, near Dyce in Aberdeenshire, the fourth of five children of Gavin Greig (1822&#150;1881), forester and land steward, and his wife, Mary (1815&#150;1893), daughter of Robert Moir, box maker, and his wife, Margaret Stiven. He was educated at Dyce parish school and Old Aberdeen grammar school, and then entered Aberdeen University in 1872 as fourth bursar in the fiercely contested bursary competition (having turned down the thirty-third bursary in 1871). He graduated MA in 1876, having studied English and logic under Alexander Bain and gained the second competition bursary to study divinity for four years at the Aberdeen Free Church College. On 2 September 1878 he married his childhood friend Isabella Burgess (1856&#150;1918), and their first child was born seven days later (they had a family of two sons and seven daughters eventually). These circumstances no doubt influenced Greig's decision to abandon his studies in favour of teaching, despite an excellent class record.<br>
<br>In 1879 Greig gained the position of schoolmaster at Whitehill School, New Deer, Aberdeenshire, against fierce competition (the Dick bequest had virtually doubled the salaries of regularly examined holders of Aberdeenshire posts, which were therefore sought by good-quality graduates). He set to and transformed a run-down school into one of the best in the region, and he introduced music and singing to the curriculum. Thereafter he threw himself into the musical life of the community, conducting choirs and brass bands, playing the piano and church organ, and writing and composing songs, hymns, plays, operettas, and musicals. In addition he wrote poetry, articles, and novels (serialized in the local newspapers); he lectured extensively on the glories of Scottish song as exemplified by the works of Burns, James Hogg, Lady Nairne, and others.<br>
<br>In 1902 Greig was asked by the New Spalding Club (an Aberdeen historical publishing society whose patron was Edward VII) to examine the feasibility of rescuing whatever still remained of the traditional music and song of the north-east of Scotland&#151;vocal or instrumental, popular, secular, or religious&#151;in order, perhaps, to fill a small volume. Greig was initially doubtful (during his lifetime in the region he had only come across a couple of examples of traditional song), but nevertheless started out collecting with his usual thoroughness and enthusiasm in late 1903. A very tall, outgoing, and popular man who put local folk at ease by speaking their native Scots, he was both surprised and delighted to find within a matter of months a considerable body of songs, well beyond his expectations, within a few miles' radius of his house.<br>
<br>Greig soon realized that he had hit upon a hitherto unsuspected treasure chest of traditional music and song&#151;and that the task of collecting it was more than one person could manage. Furthermore, in 1905 the Folk-Song Society in England (which Greig had joined in 1904) published in its <span class="italic">Journal</span> a number of songs collected by Cecil Sharp, edited to the highest modern standards, together with a list of sources (costing more than Greig's annual salary), which were deemed essential for a modern collector. Greig applied to the Carnegie trust for the universities of Scotland, and gained the first of five large research grants; he also recruited his old friend the Revd James Bruce Duncan as collaborator.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_57009"></a><span class="headword">James Bruce Duncan</span>  (1848&#150;1917), <span class="occ">folksong collector and minister of the United Free Church of Scotland</span>, was born on 13 February 1848 in the croft of Weetingshill, Whitehill, New Deer, Aberdeenshire (near to Greig's school), the fifth of eleven children of William Duncan (1814&#150;1895), a millwright and carpenter, and his wife, Elizabeth Birnie. He was educated at Whitehill School, and (from 1862) Aberdeen grammar school before entering Aberdeen University in 1865 as fourteenth bursar at the age of seventeen. Unusually for the time, he graduated MA with honours (second class: philosophy) in 1869, and thereafter studied divinity at the United Presbyterian Divinity Hall, Edinburgh, and Leipzig University. An academic high-flyer, he was assistant to Bain (and taught Greig) at Aberdeen University before being ordained to the United Presbyterian (later the United Free) Church at Lynturk, Alford, in 1876; for the rest of his life he remained there, a hard-working and devoted pastor. On 10 August 1876 he married Maggie Anderson (1845/6&#150;1893). A dark, reserved man, with a good sense of humour, he was not only an excellent musicologist but also came from a noted singing family, and had a considerable store of folk-song available to him, especially from his brother George and sister Margaret (later Mrs Gillespie).<br>
<br>In the decade before the First World War, Greig and Duncan collaborated in collecting a large and unique body of traditional music and song, mainly from the north-east of Scotland. Personal fieldwork was supplemented by correspondence stimulated by lectures and concerts and by a weekly folk-song column written by Greig for the <span class="italic">Buchan Observer</span> between 1907 and 1911, later published as <span class="italic">Folk-Song of the North-East</span> (1914). As the years passed, the compilation of a &#145;small volume&#146; rapidly transformed into an overwhelming task of editing some 3500 texts and 3100 tunes (later published in eight volumes as <span class="italic">The Greig&#150;Duncan Folk Song Collection</span>, 1981&#150;2002). Greig suggested they should initially bring out a &#145;popular&#146; edition, but Duncan objected on the grounds that this would necessitate bowdlerization; they therefore made a start on a volume of the great &#145;classical&#146; ballads (as categorized by Francis Child of Harvard in his <span class="italic">English and Scottish Popular Ballads</span>, 1882&#150;98) that they had found, and for which the region was already noted. But even this was incomplete when Greig died of heart failure on 31 August 1914 at the schoolhouse in Whitehill, where he lived, and Duncan died, as the result of a stroke some months earlier, on 30 September 1917 at his home, the manse at Lynturk. Greig was buried in Culsh cemetery, New Deer, on 4 September 1914; Duncan was buried at Alford, Aberdeenshire, on 3 October 1917.<br>
<br>Greig had drawn attention to their work by publishing and circulating widely <span class="italic">Folk-Song in Buchan</span> in 1906 (a greatly expanded version of his presidential address to the Buchan Field Club in 1905), a ground-breaking survey and analysis that brought recognition from as far away as Berlin. It was not significantly altered by any of their later writings or addresses, but these were relatively few, and regrettably neither collector managed to publish any final analysis or conclusions. The collection is significant for its size, quality, and comprehensiveness; it was also a major compilation using modern techniques by collectors who were themselves native to the region, and thus familiar with the language and culture. They were surprised to find that their informants eschewed what was then (and still is) regarded as Scottish national song&#151;&#145;we may say that Scottish book-songs [of Burns, Hogg, etc.] have never been the songs of the mass of the Scottish people&#146;  (Greig, <span class="italic">Folk-Song of the North-East</span>, 1914, ix)&#151;but any hopes that they might rewrite Scottish song (as Sharp had done for England) were dashed when they realized that their songs belonged to a corpus that transcended regional, national (Scottish and British), and even international boundaries.<br>
<br>Their deaths, the First World War, and the demise of the New Spalding Club in 1926, brought the project to an end and the papers were handed to Aberdeen University for safe keeping. In 1925 their attempted volume of Child ballads (some 13 per cent of the whole) was completed by Alexander Keith (1895&#150;1978) under the direction of the elderly William Walker (1840&#150;1931), who chose the unnecessarily elegiac title (the north-east song tradition was, and still is, thriving) of <span class="italic">Last Leaves of Traditional Ballads and Ballad Airs</span>, published by the Buchan [Field] Club. Although the editorial introduction was mainly devoted to employing the findings of Greig and Duncan to defend the disputed integrity of an earlier collector, Peter Buchan, and is unreliable in biographical and local details, the book was both widely circulated and influential. It was not until 1964 that Paul Duncan (a grandson) persuaded the English Folk Dance and Song Society to provide an editor for a joint publication of the entire collection by the University of Aberdeen and the School of Scottish Studies, Edinburgh; the first volume of this unique, important, and revolutionary eight-volume collection appeared in 1981.<br>
