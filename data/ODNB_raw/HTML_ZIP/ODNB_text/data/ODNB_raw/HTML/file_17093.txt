<span class="headword">Lower,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">Quaker activist and physician</span>, was baptized at St Tudy, Cornwall, on 11 August 1633. He was the son of Humfry Lower of Tremeer, St Tudy (<i>bap</i>. 1597, <i>d</i>. 1683), and his wife, Margery Billing (<i>d</i>. 1686). Thomas received a good education and was elected scholar of Winchester College in 1646.<br>
<br>Lower was living with his aunt Loveday Hambly at Tregangreeves, St Austell, Cornwall, in 1656, at the time that George Fox was thrown in Launceston gaol. Lower visited him there and offered him money. This was declined, but when he was released on 13 September 1656 Fox held a meeting at Tregangreeves and Lower became a convert to Quakerism around this time. Although Lower qualified as a physician (like his elder brother the physiologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17091/', "Richard Lower")</script>) and apparently practised in London, he seems to have spent most of his time in promoting the movement's growth.<br>
<br>Lower's first wife was Elizabeth Trelawny (<i>bap</i>. 1617, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1662), who died childless. On 26 October 1668 he married at Swarthmoor Hall, near Ulverston, Mary Fell (1643/4&#150;1719), fifth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9262/', "Judge Thomas Fell")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9260/', "Margaret Fell")</script>, and stepdaughter of George Fox. They had ten children, nine daughters and one son, Richard (1682&#150;1705), but it would appear that five of them died in infancy. Lower's wife and children lived at Swarthmoor Hall until 1676, when Lower purchased the estate of Marsh Grange in Furness from the Fells. There Fox sometimes came to stay with the family and dictated letters to his son-in-law.<br>
<br>In 1673 Fox and Lower were arrested for holding meetings at Armscott, Worcestershire, and taken to Worcester gaol, where they remained for more than a year. A letter which would have secured Lower's release was obtained through the interest of his brother Richard, but as it did not mention Fox, Lower chose to stay in prison with Fox. In 1675, or perhaps earlier in 1674, Fox began dictating his autobiography to Lower. In 1683 Lower went into Cornwall to transact some private business, and after holding a religious meeting at Tregangreeves was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment. His name is first on a petition of Quakers from Launceston gaol dated 1 August 1683 which was presented to Sir Job Charlton, the assize judge, but despite occasional periods of liberty he remained a prisoner until released by royal proclamation in 1686. In 1687 he received Fox's instructions respecting the disposal disposition of his property. Under Fox's will Lower received legacies of books, dials, and other property, and it was added that he could assist in compiling an account of the travels and sufferings of the Friends.<br>
<br>About 1693 Lower moved to London, probably living in Hammersmith, practised as a physician, and became involved in the activities of the Friends in the capital. In 1695, for example, he was a signatory to a petition of Quakers to parliament, the aim of which was to try and ease Friends' sufferings for refusing to swear oaths. He was also chosen, along with George Whitehead and Daniel Quare, to present an account of Quaker sufferings to William III on behalf of imprisoned Friends. Not a prolific writer, he wrote a few tracts around this time which were largely defences of Quakerism, for example, <span class="italic">An Answer to Francis Bugg's Presumptious Impeachment &hellip; Against the Quakers' Yearly Meeting</span> (1695) and <span class="italic">A Modest Vindication of the People called Quakers</span> [n.d., 1701?]. In 1696, perhaps in recognition of his work as a doctor, Lower was among those to whom Daniel Phillips dedicated his treatise on smallpox upon commencing as doctor of physic at Leiden.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Lower provided the Quaker burial-ground at Tregangreeves, Cornwall, and in 1715 he purchased some of the American property which had belonged to Fox. In 1719 Mary Lower died, aged seventy-five. Thomas died on 5 May the following year, aged eighty-eight, and was buried at Bunhill Fields on 9 May 1720.<br>
