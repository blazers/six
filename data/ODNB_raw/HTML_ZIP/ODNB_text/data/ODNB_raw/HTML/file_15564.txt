<span class="headword">King,  Henry</span>  (1592&#150;1669), <span class="occ">poet and bishop of Chichester</span>, was the eldest of the five sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15568/', "John King (d. 1621)")</script>, archdeacon of Nottingham and later bishop of London, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Henry Freeman of Henley, Buckinghamshire. He was baptized on 16 January 1592 at Worminghall, near Oxford, home of his grandfather Philip. He was educated as founder's kin at Lord Williams' School, Thame, then from about 1600 at Westminster School with his next brother, John (1595&#150;1639), who shared all his subsequent education. They both matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford (of which their father had become dean in 1605), on 20 January 1609, were tutored by Samuel Fell, and were admitted BA and MA on 19 June 1611, the year their father was made bishop of London. Both contributed to university collections of Latin epitaphs and congratulatory poems from 1612 to 1625.<br>
<br>King left Oxford on 10 July 1616, probably because he married Anne Berkeley (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;1624), eldest daughter and heir of Sir Robert Berkeley of Boycourt in Kent, who had died in 1614. She then lived in Oxford with her great-aunt Lloyd, widow of the second principal of Jesus College (her family evidently fought for a better marriage). In 1619 the Kings leased part of Vicaridge House at the west end of St Paul's in London. Of their seven children two, John and Henry, survived infancy. Anne herself died in 1624, aged only twenty-four, and was buried in Bishop John King's tomb in St Paul's on 24 January. Her husband's moving <span class="italic">Exequy</span> on her death is the poem by which he is chiefly remembered.<br>
<br>King must have been ordained by 24 January 1616, when he was collated to the prebend of St Pancras in St Paul's Cathedral, which carried with it the office of confessor, and was given the rectory and patronage of Chigwell, Essex. He was made archdeacon of Colchester on 10 April 1617, sinecure rector of Fulham on 18 November 1618, and soon after became an honorary member of Lincoln's Inn and a royal chaplain-in-ordinary. He preached his first public sermon at Paul's Cross on 5 November 1617, criticized by John Chamberlain as overbold, being &#145;so young man in such a place and at such a time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.44).<br>
<br>King's first printed sermon, preached at James I's request at Paul's Cross on 25 November 1621, was a vindication of his father's loyalty to the English church &#145;Upon Occasion of that False and Scandalous Report&#146; that he had converted to Roman Catholicism before his death. It sets the tone of Henry King's wry, often humorous and temperate comments (unusual at that time) on extremes in religion. That same year John Donne was appointed dean of St Paul's: he and King remained close friends until Donne's death in 1631, and several of King's sermons show his familiarity with Donne's sermons, then still in manuscript. As an executor, Henry commissioned the statue of Donne in St Paul's which survived the great fire, and probably, to judge by the idiosyncratic rhetorical punctuation, he was the careful editor of his <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1633).<br>
<br>King became canon of Christ Church by proxy on 3 March 1624, his only preferment for fifteen years. He and his brother John, made canon in August, were admitted BD and DD on 19 May 1625, and on 10 July, Act Sunday, preached at St Mary's: Henry in the morning and John in the afternoon, the sermons being printed together. Henry's sermon closely resembles Donne's on the same text, <span class="roman">Psalm 32</span>: 5, not through plagiarism, but by way of answer to Donne; other implicit dialogues with Donne occur in King's 1626 Lent sermon and in the third section of <span class="italic">An Exposition upon the Lord's Prayer</span>.<br>
<br>Most of King's lyrics belong to the early 1620s; another group can be dated 1630 to 1633; he also wrote satires and elegies on friends and public figures. All the early lyrics were set to music by John Wilson and are included in his song manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MS Mus.b.1). King was a keen musician, bequeathing a &#145;cabinett organ made by Craddocke&#146; in his will. Until the interregnum the poems circulated in carefully copied quarto manuscript volumes commissioned by King (apparently a unique situation); one of his scribes can be identified as Thomas Manne, student of Christ Church and later rector of St Olave, Silver Street, London. King revised and augmented the collections regularly so that wrong attributions of his poems can be dismissed.<br>
<br>As a royal chaplain King preached at Whitehall, delivering the prestigious Lent sermons. King's most lyrical of these, for 1626 and 1627, were printed, as was his Easter Spittle sermon before the lord mayor of London and the common councillors in 1626, with descriptions of the recent devastating plague visitation. His <span class="italic">Exposition upon the Lord's Prayer</span> (1628) is based on afternoon sermons at St Paul's. They begin about 1623 (as a reference to Prince Charles's recently abandoned Spanish marriage shows); the 1625 plague evidently caused a gap in the series, and each section looks gracefully towards James I's own commentary on the prayer. King's moderate Calvinist theology, his dislike of extremes, his keen sense of loss after his young wife's death, his firmly expressed pastoral teaching, his learning, and views on his times and life in general are best seen in these eleven sermons.<br>
<br>There are no lyric poems or printed sermons from the period subsequent to 1634 which coincides with Laud's archbishopric. In 1633, after eight years' service, King ceased to sit on the court of high commission. On 6 February 1639, however, King was installed as dean of Rochester, where in 1640 he built a new deanery. That same year he preached a significant Accession day sermon at Paul's Cross on 27 March emphasizing the importance of obedience to Charles I's sacred authority in language which anticipated parts of the ecclesiastical canons passed by convocation in the following weeks.<br>
<br>King was appointed bishop of Chichester on 12 October 1641, and consecrated on 6 February 1642, the day after parliament passed a bill excluding bishops from the Lords. Like his two predecessors he held the rectory of Petworth to compensate for the poverty of the bishopric. He lived in the palace at Chichester until the siege of December 1642, when he fled (not, as reported, taken prisoner) first to Petworth, then to Albury. He lived with his widowed sister, Elizabeth Holt, and her family, presumably in the house he had rented from George Aungier since 1634, close to his second cousin George Duncombe, with whom he was frequently involved in financial transactions (he also held bonds with the earls of Northumberland and Arundel).<br>
<br>In 1643 King was harshly sequestered, but managed to transfer the St Paul's Churchyard house to his son Henry. William Oughtred, at Shere, near Albury, coached King's son John, who seduced his daughter. After this difficult episode King moved, in 1645, to live with his nephew, John King's son, at Blakesware, Hertfordshire, and by 1647 was at Richings, near Slough, home of Lady Salter, niece of Brian Duppa, where he set up a small praying community with family, including his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68071/', "Anne King")</script>, and friends. On 11 March 1649 he wrote an elegy &#145;from my sad retirement&#146; on Charles I, buried at nearby Windsor. That year John Hales, on losing his Eton fellowship, became their chaplain until 1655. In 1651 King published <span class="italic">The Psalmes of David &hellip; to be Sung after the Old Tunes used in the Churches</span> (some were later set to music by Playford in <span class="italic">Psalms and Hymns</span>, 1671); King's letter to Bishop Ussher in October with a presentation copy explains his reasons. About this time King also wrote to Izaak Walton, an old friend through John Donne, although later omitted from King's will.<br>
<br>Thereafter King stayed sometimes with his sister, Dorothy Hubert, and her husband, Sir Richard, at Langley, or with his brother Philip at Hitcham. King drew up his will in 1653 when he was engaged with Duppa in travelling the country ordaining men according to the rite of the forbidden <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. About 1655, when few bishops remained alive, it was proposed that he should cross with one other to the continent for fresh consecrations, but none would accompany him. His <span class="italic">Poems, Elegies and Paradoxes</span> was first printed by Richard Marriott and Henry Herringman in 1657 from authoritative manuscripts, ostensibly without his permission; a second edition, published in 1664, was augmented by the elegy on Charles I and four others.<br>
<br>Named for the archbishopric of York at the Restoration (as his disgruntled prospective successor at Chichester, Edward Burton, reported), King lost it by going down to settle affairs in his diocese. His visitation sermon, 8 October 1662, shows how sensitively he dealt with the jarring factions among his clergy, &#145;laying controversies asleep and silencing disputes&#146;  (Hobbs, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 37). He was active in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Two of King's Whitehall sermons were published, that for Charles II's Accession day anniversary in 1661, first of the new reign (reprinted 1713, when another civil war seemed to threaten), and that for Charles I's execution, published in January 1665. &#145;A good and eloquent&#146; sermon heard on 8 March 1663 by Samuel Pepys, one listed for Lent 1666, and one heard by John Evelyn on 28 February 1669 have not survived, nor has a visitation sermon reported by Giles Moore, rector of Horsted Keynes, on 8 September 1669  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Giles Moore</span>, ed. R. Bird, Sussex RS, 68, 1971, 232). King's preaching was much esteemed and imitated in his own day. Bishop Brian Duppa's funeral sermon, preached in Westminster Abbey on 24 April 1662, is an excellent example of his style, and a valuable source for Duppa's life and the interregnum. It reveals that King had also preached the Garter day sermon at Windsor in 1661.<br>
<br>King died on 30 September 1669 at the bishop's palace, and was buried on 8 October in the south choir aisle of Chichester Cathedral. As his will requested he received a simple ledger stone like his father's, with the words &#145;Deposita redditurae animae&#146;, but the family then ordered the ornate memorial later placed in the north transept. His second son, Henry, a gentleman of the royal chamber, had predeceased him on 21 February, and his heir, John, died on 10 March 1671, leaving his father's books, described in Henry's will as &#145;a small remainder of a large Library taken from me at Chichester contrary to the condicon and contracte of the Generall and Counsell of Warre&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/133, sig. 136, 16 Nov 1669), to recreate the cathedral library. About 300 of 2000 books survive there, among them some twenty titles from John Donne's library. The York gospels, lost during the civil wars, were also mysteriously returned by King's executors.<br>
