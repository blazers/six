<span class="headword">Black,  Edward</span>  (1900&#150;1948), <span class="occ">film producer</span>, was born on 18 August 1900 at 90 Hensham Road, Birmingham, one of three sons of George Black, then a house-painter, and his wife, Mary Davies. His father, subsequently an actor and stage carpenter, gave up his job as property master at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, to run a hand-cranked children's roundabout, a touring waxworks, and then a cinematograph film show. In 1905 he rented a Presbyterian chapel in Sunderland and turned it into the Monkwearmouth Picture Hall, one of the first permanent cinemas in Britain. When George Black died in 1910 he had eight cinemas in operation and Edward was able to help his brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56528/', "George Black")</script>, to run the expanding circuit.<br>
<br>In 1928 the Black brothers' cinemas were taken over by the General Theatre Corporation, which was itself quickly swallowed by the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. Black was employed as a circuit manager but in 1930 he switched to the production side of the corporation, becoming assistant production manager at the Gainsborough studios in Islington. By 1936 he had become producer in chief, responsible for the production of around six films a year. The following year, the main Gaumont-British studio at Lime Grove, Shepherd's Bush, which was making heavy losses, was closed down, but Black's efficient Gainsborough unit continued to operate, turning out popular comedies like <span class="italic">Oh Mr Porter</span> (1937) and thrillers such as <span class="italic">The Lady Vanishes</span> (1938). When war broke out in September 1939, the Islington studio&#151;a converted power station with a huge chimney&#151;was considered too vulnerable to German bombs and Black moved the Gainsborough team into Lime Grove. There he produced highly successful films such as <span class="italic">Millions Like Us</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The Man in Grey</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Black's strategy was to build up a stable of stars and to put out a balanced production programme consisting of comedies, musicals, melodramas, thrillers, and serious war films. However, the phenomenal success of <span class="italic">The Man in Grey</span> in 1943 destroyed the power balance at the studio. The nominal head of production at Gainsborough, Maurice Ostrer, was a director of Gaumont-British and the brother of its chairman, Isidore Ostrer (though by 1943 the company was in the process of being transferred to the Rank Organisation). Maurice Ostrer decided that the success of <span class="italic">The Man in Grey</span> proved that Gainsborough had hit on a winning formula and henceforth the studio should concentrate entirely on costume melodrama. Black disagreed and when he was overruled, left to act as a producer for Alexander Korda.<br>
<br>Black's tenacity was tested to the limit in producing Korda's unwieldy historical epic, <span class="italic">Bonnie Prince Charlie</span> (1948), and he died of lung cancer on 30 November 1948 at his home, Flat 60, Fairacres, Roehampton, Putney. He was only forty-eight. His widow, Frances Clementine Black, survived him. Together the couple had two daughters. An indefatigable worker, Black was respected by actors, writers, directors, and technicians. He fostered the careers of Margaret Lockwood, Phyllis Calvert, Michael Redgrave, Stewart Granger, and James Mason, giving them the opportunity to develop as popular British film stars. He also encouraged the development of a talented scriptwriting team, ensuring that Gainsborough films were based on original scripts rather than adaptations of novels and stage plays. James Mason, who regarded producers as his natural enemies, made an exception for Black, whom he respected and saw as largely responsible for the success of Gainsborough as a studio. Sidney Gilliat, who worked under Black as scriptwriter and director, pointed out that he had &#145;the longest and most financially successful run any producer in Britain has ever had&#146;  (Brown, 112). Black staunchly protected Gilliat from studio politics while he was making his first film as a solo director, <span class="italic">Waterloo Road</span> (1944). Gilliat admired his unflappability and described him as &#145;a man to go tiger shooting with&#146;  (ibid., 111). He was the sort of efficient but imaginative producer the British film industry sorely needed.<br>
