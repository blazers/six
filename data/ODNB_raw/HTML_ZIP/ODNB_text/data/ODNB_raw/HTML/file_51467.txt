<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burton,  William Shakespeare</span>  (1824&#150;1916), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London on 1 June 1824, the son of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4143/', "William Evans Burton (1804&#150;1860)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Loft (<i>d</i>. 1876). To escape from his difficult wife Burton's father moved to the USA in 1834, where he became a highly successful actor, publisher, and theatrical entrepreneur, collaborating at one time with Edgar Allan Poe. Burton attended King's College School, London, where John Sell Cotman taught drawing, and in 1842 the Government Schools of Design under William Dyce. He also undertook his own studies at the British Museum. He became a probationer at the Royal Academy Schools on 6 July 1846 and full student on 18 December. Earlier that year he exhibited at the Royal Academy a portrait of his favourite dog, Grip.<br>
<br>Burton's dedication and capacity for work (sometimes sixteen hours a day) were soon noted. He was befriended by a printseller who allowed him use of a garret, commissioned illustrative work, and exhibited his products in his shop window. A copy of a picture from the National Gallery impressed the journalist Tom Taylor, who arranged for Burton to supply decorative capital letters for <span class="italic">Punch</span> and encouraged his painterly ambitions. Burton's father sent him money and invited him to America, advising him against becoming &#145;a beggarly painter&#146;, but to no avail  (Dibdin, 290).<br>
<br>In 1849&#150;52 Burton exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution and in December 1851 was awarded a gold medal for <span class="italic">Delilah Asking Forgiveness of Samson in Captivity</span>, illustrating Milton's <span class="italic">Samson Agonistes</span>. It was shown at the Royal Academy in the following May and at the Irish Industrial Exhibition, Dublin, in 1853. <span class="italic">The First Shot to Freedom, Switzerland</span>, a meticulously painted portrayal of the small son of William Tell (priv. coll.), showed an evident debt to Pre-Raphaelitism, and in 1856 was followed by Burton's greatest success, <span class="italic">A Wounded Cavalier</span> (City of London Guildhall), probably inspired by Millais's <span class="italic">Proscribed Royalist</span> (1853; priv. coll.), which similarly illustrates the triumph of human charity over religious and political differences. <span class="italic">A Wounded Cavalier</span> was immediately hailed as a triumph of Pre-Raphaelitism and appeared subsequently at the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition (1887) and the City of London Guildhall (1890 and 1897) before being purchased by the latter gallery in 1911.<br>
<br>In Burton's picture human tragedy and emotional conflict are conveyed through a technique equal to that of any member of the brotherhood. The cavalier, who has had his dispatches taken and lies mortally wounded, has been discovered by a passing puritan couple whose feelings are diametrically opposed. The woman, forgetful of everything but pity and compassion, comforts the dying man, while her male companion stands rigidly aloof, bristling with disapproval and resentment. The precision with which every detail, from the faces and costumes of the figures to the silver birch tree, red admiral butterfly, moss, lichen, dead fern, and leaf, is painted adds to the immediacy of this powerful image.<br>
<br>The circumstances surrounding the exhibition of <span class="italic">A Wounded Cavalier</span> in 1856 support Burton's claim that he was the victim of a conspiracy among the porters at the academy because of his objections to their demands for tips from students; a claim which was corroborated by one of the porters shortly before his death  (<span class="italic">Bazaar, Exchange and Mart</span>, 2 July 1897, 6). In reprisal they withheld <span class="italic">A Wounded Cavalier</span> from the selection committee. Charles West Cope, a committee member, accidentally discovered it and insisted on its being hung, removing one of his own paintings to make way for it. When Burton's <span class="italic">London Magdalen</span> was also rejected in 1857 Tom Taylor confronted the selection committee with it, and they assured him that they had never seen it before. Burton subsequently suffered a breakdown and developed severe eye trouble. He was cared for by wealthy friends, including Taylor and Lord and Lady Duff Gordon. On 13 March 1857 he married a cousin, Maria (1821/2&#150;1863), daughter of Edward Rainford, corn factor. Their only child, a son, was born about 1861.<br>
<br>Burton's father had died a rich man in New York in 1860, but had left his estate to charity. Burton paid for his mother to travel to the USA, where in 1864 she made legal history by becoming the first alien to be granted right of dower. But instead of sharing the inheritance with her son, she spent it on an annuity for herself  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Feb 1916, 7). Money troubles and other misfortunes were to dog Burton for decades.<br>
<br>Altogether Burton exhibited seventeen works at the Royal Academy and fourteen at the Liverpool Academy, although some were shown at both venues. <span class="italic">In a Convent</span> appeared at the Royal Academy in 1858; in 1864 <span class="italic">Guinevere</span> and <span class="italic">Elaine</span> reflected the Pre-Raphaelite move towards more poetical subjects; and <span class="italic">The Angels at the Sepulchre</span> (exh. Liverpool Academy, 1864; RA, 1865) heralded Burton's increasing taste for religious subjects. He also painted portraits, and genre subjects in oil and watercolour, and in 1864&#150;5 four illustrations were published in <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>. He later produced eighteen illustrations for his second wife's first novel, <span class="italic">Annabel</span> (1889), and probably also designed the cover. Burton clearly excelled in the field, and it is likely that more of his illustrative work remains to be identified.<br>
<br>Burton's first wife died suddenly and he was remarried, on 3 December 1863, at St Peter Port, Guernsey, to Mina Elizabeth Adlington (1839/40&#150;1911), daughter of Thomas Ellis Adlington, registrar of the courts of exchequer and chancery. They settled in Essex, where two daughters, Violet and Laura, were born before the family left for Florence in 1868. There Burton produced original work and also made copies of paintings by Botticelli and other pre-Raphael painters; but ill health, money troubles, and about 1870 the death of his nine-year-old son incapacitated him. Subsequently the family travelled to Naples, Cassino, and elsewhere, living in dire poverty. A third daughter, Lucy, was born in Rovezzano, Florence, in 1872. An infant son born in 1874 died aged eleven weeks.<br>
<br>In letters to the Royal Academy (1874&#150;5) Burton graphically described the serious illnesses of himself, his wife, and children, and the death of his son; and denied rumours current in London that drink was the cause of his distress. In 1874 Burton named Tom Taylor and Millais as referees. In 1875, in two further letters, Burton renewed his pleadings; but Millais, exasperated by the constant flood of &#145;piteous letters&#146; from him over the years, and the fact that he had been helped many times, advised against further help, saying that a previous donation from the Artists' General Benevolent Institution had been followed by unsatisfactory reports about him.<br>
<br>In 1876, on the death of his mother, Burton returned to England, where he lived at Belmont Street, Bognor. He was now almost forgotten as an artist and his work, including the dramatic <span class="italic">Angel of Death</span>  (Purcell, 245), suffered further refusals. In 1882 he had a major breakdown complicated by severe neuralgia, which forced him to abandon painting completely. He recovered suddenly in 1889, experiencing &#145;clairvoyantly&#146; a vision of a blood clot disappearing from his brain, and immediately returned to painting  (V. Burton, xvi).<br>
<br>Burton's later years were more productive. Dibdin mentions portraits, genre and other subjects, and various designs as well as a number of major works, now known only through photographs (White, vol. 3; Dibdin; Purcell; Bate; Witt Library). One painting that has survived is a copy of Perugino's fresco of the transfiguration in the Collegio del Cambio, Perugia, which is at Tyntesfield, Somerset. Dated 1882, this may have originated in one of the copies Burton is known to have made in Italy. In 1886 Frederick Stephens (while claiming that Burton was dead) discussed in detail <span class="italic">A Wounded Cavalier</span> in his <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> review of Albert Wood's collection. The painting was included in an exhibition to celebrate the opening of the Guildhall Art Gallery in 1890 and again in the queen's diamond jubilee year, 1897. In the same year, one of his most ambitious works, <span class="italic">Faithful unto Death (Auto da Fe)</span>&#151;another Royal Academy reject&#151;was hung in the <span class="roman">Victorian Era</span> exhibition at Earl's Court.<br>
<br>Also in 1897 Burton's strikingly hieratic <span class="italic">King of Sorrows</span> attracted considerable attention at the Royal Academy. Burton's name being little known, it was assumed to be the work of a gifted young man  (V. Burton, xvii), probably because of its symbolist overtones. Another portrayal of Christ, <span class="italic">The World's Ingratitude and St Michael</span> (1903&#150;4), also illustrates this tendency. Probably as a result of confusion with his near-namesake William Paton Burton (1828&#150;1883) it was again necessary in 1901 to reaffirm that Burton was alive and still at work  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Jan 1901). When <span class="italic">A Wounded Cavalier</span> was purchased by the Guildhall Art Gallery in 1911 a committee was formed &#145;with very influential support&#146; to provide for him financially for the remainder of his life  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Feb 1916, 7).<br>
<br>Burton's wife, Mina Elizabeth Burton, the author of at least three novels, died late in 1911. Burton's remaining years were sustained by his two remaining daughters (Laura had died after their return to England), supportive friends, and a strong religious faith. Shortly before his death, aged almost ninety-two, he was persuaded by M. H. Spielmann to record his artistic opinions, which were published posthumously in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Burton felt out of touch with modern developments. He disliked the overly realistic religious art of Holman Hunt, and was especially horrified at what he had witnessed in major exhibitions in London in 1910 and 1912. Post-impressionists, cubists, and futurists had consigned art to &#145;gloomy darkness&#146;, Burton wrote. He singled out Matisse's <span class="italic">La danse</span> as the personification of the new trends: &#145;senseless, unfeeling Ignorant Brutality [revelling] over the grave of murdered Art, with all its Beauty, Grace, Love, Tenderness, Imagination, Poetry, and Friendliness&#151;all swept away in Art-Attila destruction&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Feb 1916, 11).<br>
<br>Burton died at his home, 4 Belmont Park, Lee, London, on 26 January 1916. Spielmann praised him as a &#145;noble spirit and a holy mind, a man whose retiring nature and modest refinement deprived him of the recognition he fancied he had wholly missed. No honester artist ever breathed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Feb 1916, 11). All Burton's biographers echoed Gleeson White's view that &#145;Of all artists whose early promise led the world to expect much, few have enjoyed less recognition&#146;  (White, 3.36). A strange but appropriate footnote to Burton's unworldly life is that for a period after the first anniversary of his death, with the aid of a spirit guide he seemed regularly to communicate with his daughter Violet Mina Burton (1866&#150;1934), who recorded his revelations in <span class="italic">An Artist in the Great Beyond: Messages from a Father</span> (1925).<br>
