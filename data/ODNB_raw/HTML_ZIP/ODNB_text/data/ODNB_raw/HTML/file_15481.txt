<span class="headword">Ketel,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1100), <span class="occ">thaumaturgical writer</span>, is mentioned only in a lost manuscript of unknown date which contained hagiographical material concerning St John of Beverley, and which was printed (from a transcript) by the seventeenth-century editors of the <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum</span>. After the conclusion of Folcard's <span class="italic">Life of St John Beverley</span>, this manuscript contained a series of miracle stories relating to that saint and headed: &#145;Other Miracles Written by William Ketel, Clerk of Beverley&#146;. The ensuing chapter began with a dedication, the Latin of which is evidently corrupt, but which was apparently addressed by &#145;William, least of the clerks of St John&#146; to two of his superiors, who appear as &#145;Ethal.&#146; and &#145;Thur.&#146;, and who had respectively the offices of provost and master  (Raine, <span class="italic">Historians of the Church of York</span>, 1.261, n. 1). After the series of stories thus introduced, the manuscript preserved a second series, which began with an expression of astonishment that of all the clerks of Beverley only William, &#145;who is also called Ketel&#146;  (ibid., 292), should have related the miracles of St John. The same miracle stories as in the lost manuscript are largely found in BL, Cotton MS Faustina B.iv (twelfth-century), and there is also a selection in BL, Add. MS 61901 (fifteenth-century); but neither of these manuscripts contains the references to William Ketel.<br>
<br>Allowing for the corruption of the dedication, one of the dedicatees of Ketel's miracle stories may have been Thurstan, provost of Beverley, who appears in charters of <i>c</i>.1135&#150;52, and died, according to John of Hexham, in 1152. This would suggest that Ketel worked in the first half of the twelfth century, which would not be inconsistent with the fact that the latest datable events in the miracle stories concern the reign of William the Conqueror (Ketel stated that he was relating miracles of which he had personal knowledge or which he knew on good authority). On the other hand, the dedication may mean that the provost was an otherwise unknown Ethal, and Ketel may have worked as early as the late eleventh century. Verbal similarities to Alfred of Beverley (who was writing about 1143) in Ketel's stories probably result from Alfred's having drawn on them rather than vice versa; and, if it is correct (which is not certain) that the reference in the stories to St John's &#145;former&#146; tomb was made in relation to the tomb established after the translation of 1197, it is likely that this was a later interpolation. The miracle stories are not of great historical interest, although they do contain clues to the development of the cult of St John and of Beverley Minster as a building; and Ketel's account of the visit of King &AElig;thelstan to Beverley appears to be the earliest version of this alleged event. Ketel was a Scandinavian name, properly spelled Ketill, and was widespread in eastern England.<br>
