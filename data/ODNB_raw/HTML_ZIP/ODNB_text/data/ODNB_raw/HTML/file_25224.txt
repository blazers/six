<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1652), <span class="occ">buccaneer</span>, born in Wapping of unknown parents, gave his age in 1682 as about thirty. He claimed to have served under Henry Morgan in the sacking of Panama in 1671. He seems also to have been among those who destroyed Porto Bello in 1679. In an attempt to repeat Morgan's earlier feat, Sharpe and some 330 buccaneers landed on the coast of Darien on 5 April 1680 with the aim of crossing the isthmus and sacking Panama for a second time. This small army included what might now be described as a &#145;press corps&#146;: Basil Ringrose, whose journal was printed as the second volume of Exquemelin's <span class="italic">Bucaniers of America</span> (1685), William Dampier, author of <span class="italic">New Voyage Round the World</span> (1697), and Lionel Wafer, surgeon and author of <span class="italic">A New Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of America</span> (1699). Two lesser figures also left eyewitness narrative accounts relating to the expedition.<br>
<br>The Indians who led the buccaneers through the forest persuaded them to undertake a preliminary attack on the Spanish settlement at Santa Maria, where great quantities of gold were reputed to be stockpiled. After the attack on Santa Maria on 15 April, which yielded no gold, the buccaneers made their own way, on foot and in canoes, to the port of Panama. On 25 April they surprised a fleet of three ships and 280 Spaniards and took possession of several armed vessels, a coup which offered scope to conduct unlimited operations. After two large-scale defections, Sharpe was elected overall commander on 28 May. With a force reduced to 140 men, and on board a single vessel, the <i>Trinity</i>, Sharpe spent the next eighteen months scouring the coast for prizes. On 28 October he attempted an opposed landing on the Chilean coast at Port Ilo, near Arica, before sailing southwards as far as the 30th parallel. On 3 December a raid ashore was repelled by a large force of about 250 Spanish cavalry. On 4 December, despite stiff opposition, the buccaneers entered the town of Coquimbo where an attempt to extort 100,000 pieces of eight from the governor failed, forcing them to withdraw.<br>
<br>Sharpe now made for Juan Fernandez to resupply before attempting a voyage home through the Strait of Magellan, but the decision to return caused a mutiny and Sharpe was put in irons. On 28 January the <i>Trinity</i> loomed off Arica for a second time and a hundred men disembarked to attack the town. This time the buccaneers were repulsed by a force of more than 600. After the battle twenty-seven buccaneers lay dead and the remainder withdrew to the <i>Trinity's</i> waiting boats. Sharpe was quickly reinstalled as commander. On 28 July 1681, in what are now Equadorian waters, Sharpe overhauled the Spanish vessel <i>Rosario</i>. During the struggle Sharpe shot the captain, John Lopez, and seized a book which the Spaniards were about to heave overboard. On examination the book was found to be a <i>derrotero</i>, or waggoner; a secret collection of charts and pilotage directions detailing coastal features and all the anchorages from California to Cape Horn. The <i>Rosario</i> also carried another treasure: she was smuggling a large quantity of silver, coated in tin to avoid duty. Sharpe's subsequent claim that he was unable to persuade his crew to transfer the contraband into the <i>Trinity</i> seems unlikely. He and his crew were probably just ignorant of what lay in the hold. Accordingly, they cut the vessel and her silver adrift. Their error was discovered only when one of the bars, taken as a souvenir, was examined in England.<br>
<br>The <i>Trinity</i> now remained at sea almost continuously until the second week of October when, after days of heavy storms, Sharpe sighted the mountains of southern Chile and sheltered in a coastal inlet. On 6 November he sailed for the straits but a great storm on the 12th pushed him far south of his intended track. He had no option but to weather the Horn instead, becoming the first English captain to do so in an easterly direction. On 20 November the <i>Trinity</i> reached her most southerly position, 57&deg;40' S, where she steered among icebergs. In sailing so far south Sharpe was able to prove that <i>terra australis incognito</i> was a fiction and this constitutes his greatest achievement. In one manuscript copy of his journal the entry for 28 November 1681 reads:<blockquote>in this my passage about Terra del Fuogo I sailed in near 60 degrees south lattitude therefore doe find by experience that there is no such a tract of land as the dutch call Terra australis incognito and that which lies to the eastward of the straghts of Le maire which the Dutch call staten land I found to be an Isle the which I named Albemarle Island &amp; I being the first that ever sailed about all this way doe call the passage after my own name. (Sharpe's journal, Pierpont Morgan Library, MA 3310)</blockquote>By 26 January 1682 favourable winds allowed the ship to cover distances of up to 132 miles a day. Barbados was sighted on 28 January but the presence of the English warship <i>Richmond</i> forced the buccaneers to steer for Nevis. From here, most of the crew took passage to England, Sharpe arriving in Plymouth on or about 24 March.<br>
<br>On 10 June 1682 Sharpe and two of his crew were indicted on charges of piracy and murder in the high court of Admiralty. The charges were instigated by the Spanish ambassador to London, Don Pedro Ronquillo, who also acted as chief prosecutor. Evidence that Charles II tampered with the trial in order to obtain an illicit copy of the <i>derrotero</i> and to spare Sharpe's life probably explains the court's decision to acquit the defendants on a technicality. The verdict caused a minor diplomatic incident with Spain.<br>
<br>After his trial Sharpe was appointed captain of his majesty's sloop <i>Bonetta</i> by the Admiralty. He never took up his command. According to one source he bought a leaky vessel moored in the Thames which he used to board a French vessel near the Downs. In this prize he returned to the Caribbean, appearing in the Leeward Islands with a commission to hunt down pirates in January 1684, and later in Bermuda, where he ingratiated himself with the governor, Richard Coney. In July 1686 the governor of Nevis sent the frigate <i>Dartmouth</i> to Bermuda to bring Sharpe to justice for acts of piracy in Jamaica (1684) and Campeachy (1686). Sharpe stood trial in Nevis on 30 December, and again on 12 February 1687, but he wriggled free both times. In 1688 he appeared in Anguilla, having declared himself governor.<br>
<br>By 1696 Sharpe had settled on the island of St Thomas, acquiring a smallholding and seven slaves. He seems to have married, and to have had a son. By 1698 he was heavily in debt and, in an attempt to evade his creditors, Sharpe made an arrangement with Captain Garwey, commander of a visiting English vessel, to leave the island secretly. Tipped off by the slaves, the Danish authorities arrested Sharpe on the night of 10 May 1698 as he loaded his chattels into the launch sent to meet him. Swearing to avenge himself upon the island as a whole Sharpe was sentenced to life imprisonment. His wife and son were held in custody in the fort. The governor, J. Lorentz, tried to have Sharpe transferred to Bremerholm prison in Copenhagen but permission was denied. Sharpe's wife died on 30 October 1698, and the boy died on 12 December. Sharpe was still captive in the fort on St Thomas in 1699. About this time he was described as being lame, and without the use of his hands.<br>
