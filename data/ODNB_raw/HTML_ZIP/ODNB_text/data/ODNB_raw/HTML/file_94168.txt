<span class="headword">Gavin,  Hector</span>  (1815&#150;1855), <span class="occ">sanitary reformer</span>, was born on 29 August 1815 in Edinburgh, the eldest of the eight children of Hector Gavin (<i>b</i>. 1784), engraver, and his wife, Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker. Apprenticed at the age of sixteen to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Gavin turned his back on the family engraving trade to study medicine. In 1835 he won the prize for military surgery and in 1836 he was awarded the degree of MD by Edinburgh University. Two years later he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on the strength of his prize essay, &#145;On feigned and factitious diseases&#146;. Later expanded into a book, his essay proved an essential resource for military and naval medical staff in identifying malingerers.<br>
<br>In December 1837 Gavin married Margaret, daughter of James Greenfield, and he and his new bride moved to London in 1838, Gavin having paid &pound;1500 for a medical practice on the Hackney Road. Living close to the surgery, he was quickly initiated into the sanitary misery of early Victorian London. With human and animal waste lining the streets, industrial pollution, and extensive overcrowding, the registrar-general put the average age of death in 1839 in nearby Whitechapel at only twenty-six years. A keen advocate of preventive medicine, Gavin put himself forward as surgeon to the Bethnal Green workhouse. His altruistic commitment to sanitary improvement meant that he quickly added to his responsibilities the London Orphan Asylum and British Penitent Female Refuge. In addition, at Charing Cross Hospital, he lectured in forensic medicine, innovatively introducing public hygiene into the course.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Gavin moved from medical philanthropy into public advocacy. He became a leading figure in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95366', "Health of Towns Association")</script>, deploying his local knowledge to expose London's sanitary horrors. Through deft use of the registrar-general's mortality statistics, the association hoped to shame central government into reform. As pamphleteer and co-editor of its journal, Gavin was among its most effective propagandists:<blockquote>There are parts of London where I have walked for hours with liquid putrefying filth in every kennel or hollow&#151;where the odour was that of one perpetual sewer or cesspool, and where squalor and wretchedness were visible without variety. (Gavin, <span class="italic">Report of the Health of London Association</span>, 26)</blockquote>His most celebrated work, <span class="italic">Sanitary Ramblings</span> (1848), comprised a street-by-street account of Bethnal Green's alleys and slums. The 1848 <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span> constituted marked progress for reformers, but it unconscionably excluded London from its remit. In response the Metropolitan Sanitary Association was formed, with Gavin as one of its honorary secretaries. He used his position to criticize the capital's sanitary state and urge the extension of the 1848 act to London.<br>
<br>Gavin's industriousness and ability had by this time caught the eye of officialdom. Edwin Chadwick was greatly impressed by Gavin's approach and in 1848 he was appointed secretary and medical superintending inspector to the newly formed Board of Health. He joined a cadre of interventionist reformers who dramatically improved central and local approaches to sanitary management. The expertise he garnered at the Board of Health during the 1848 cholera outbreak later inspired Lord Palmerston to dispatch Gavin to the West Indies to manage the epidemic threatening the Caribbean. Between 1851 and 1853, Gavin travelled across the West Indies dealing with cholera, influenza, and smallpox. By this time a highly adept medical bureaucrat, he secured changes in colonial personnel, reforms to sanitation, and a system of dispensary relief. Despite catching yellow fever in Barbados, Gavin also found time to edit one of his lectures into <span class="italic">The Habitations of the Industrial Classes</span> (1851). The work marked a shift from the Health of Towns Association strategy of energizing public opinion to a more stringent demand for state interference in housing and sanitation.<br>
<br>On his return to England Gavin was dispatched by the Board of Health to assist in the cholera outbreak at Newcastle upon Tyne. Highly impatient with the deadly bumbledom of the council and the medical fraternity, Gavin administered a series of reforms&#151;closing unsuitable dwellings, safely disposing of bodies, and moving the sick&#151;which dramatically cut infection levels. While his high-handed manner infuriated local doctors, he claimed his strategy of house-to-house visitation reduced mortality from two hundred per thousand to three per thousand. He was later posted to Dundee and Edinburgh to manage similar cholera outbreaks.<br>
<br>Back in London his medical skills were in demand for the employees of the postal service and in 1854 he was appointed government medical officer to the Post Office. The very next day Gavin was also made sanitary commissioner to the army in the Crimea. Appalled by the disease rife among the Crimea troops, Gavin had proposed a series of reforms to the earl of Shaftesbury. In turn Shaftesbury proposed that Gavin should join John Sutherland and Robert Rawlinson in assisting the troops. The commissioners arrived in Istanbul in March 1855 and immediately began improving the hospital management to ease the cholera epidemic. Florence Nightingale later remarked to Shaftesbury: &#145;That Commission saved the British Army&#146;  (Spriggs, 291). In April they travelled to Balaklava to sanitize the army's filthy systems for latrines, burial, food preparation, and refuse. But, sadly, there Gavin was to join the fallen.<br>
<br>After dining with his brother William Gavin (a veterinarian attached to the Scots Greys), Hector Gavin sought to exchange a faulty pistol for one of his brother's. In the exchange, the pistol exploded and Gavin was shot through the abdomen. He died at Balaklava on the following morning, 21 April 1855. It was a needless end for a sanitary reformer who believed in both the value of preventive medicine and the necessity of state legislation to prevent huge numbers of equally unnecessary, avoidable deaths. He was buried at Balaklava and later commemorated in the Old Calton burial-ground, Edinburgh.<br>
