<span class="headword">Bray,  William Trewartha <span class="st"> [Billy]</span></span>  (1794&#150;1868), <span class="occ">Methodist Bible Christian preacher</span>, was born at Twelveheads, in the parish of Kea, near Truro, on 1 June 1794, the only son and eldest of three children (one of the daughters was of unsound mind) of William Bray, Methodist tin miner, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Robert and Jane Trewartha of Chengenter, Gwennap. At the age of seventeen he left home to pursue his trade as a tin miner in Devon, and succumbed to drink and a profligate lifestyle.<br>
<br>After seven years Bray returned to Cornwall and on 16 July 1821, at Kea church, he married Joanna, also a lapsed Methodist. The manner of Bray's conversion, gradually accomplished in November 1823, assisted by the reading of John Bunyan's <span class="italic">Visions of Heaven and Hell</span> and driven by fear of the consequences of drunkenness for his family life, indicated that a remarkable revivalist was about to emerge. The crucial step began with a determination to rise and pray in the middle of the night; he continued in prayer the following morning, and took for spiritual nourishment the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Wesley's hymnbook. It was only afterwards that he roared away his &#145;load&#146; at the Bryanite (or Bible Christian) meeting.<br>
<br>Twelveheads was near Wesley's revival centre at Gwennap pit; Bray's grandfather had been one of his converts and had helped to build the Twelveheads chapel. Bray now became a locally celebrated revivalist on his own account, becoming a local preacher in 1824 and labouring outside as well as within the Bible Christian denomination, to which he gave lifelong allegiance. He built many chapels with his own hands, including his first at Bethel, Cross Lanes.<br>
<br>The distinctive thing about Billy Bray which made him a legend in his lifetime and made his biography one of the Methodist best-sellers of the century was an immediate apprehension of the divine glory which issued naturally in leaping, dancing, and cheerful controversy with the world. His claim that &#145;if they were to put me into a barrel, <i>I would shout glory out through the bunghole!</i>&#146; was not a facetious pose, but the normal expression of an irrepressibly good-humoured Christian. His charismatic leadership included an emphasis on prayer, healing, and reverence for the sabbath, as well as a vehement dislike of drinking and smoking. He died on 25 May 1868 at Twelveheads and was buried in Baldhu.<br>
