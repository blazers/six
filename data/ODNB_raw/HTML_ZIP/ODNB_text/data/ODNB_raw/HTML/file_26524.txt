<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Still,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1544&#150;1608), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was the second son of William Still of Grantham, Lincolnshire. Little is known of his early years. Sir John Harington, who knew Still from his student days in Cambridge, relates that his breeding was &#145;from his childhood in good literature and partly in musicke, which was counted in those days a preparative to divinity&#146;  (Harington, 157). His father was clearly a man of some substance, sending two of his sons to Cambridge and marrying a daughter into the Winthrop family of Groton in Suffolk.<br>
<br>In November 1559 Still matriculated pensioner from Christ's College, Cambridge, where his ability shone and he graduated BA in March 1562. He was elected a fellow of Christ's before midsummer 1562 and proceeded MA in 1565 and BD in 1570. His reputation at Cambridge was high. Gabriel Harvey, who was a contemporary at Christ's, acknowledged him as &#145;an excellent philosopher, a reasonable good historian, a learned divine, and a wise man&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Harington, who relates that when he came to Still &#145;to sue for my grace to be a batchelour first he examined me stricktly, and after answered me kindly, that the grace he granted me was not of grace but of merit&#146;, had the highest admiration for his examiner: &#145;to whom I never came but I grew more religious, from whom I never went but I parted better instructed&#146;. Known as Divine Still by his friends, he was generally acknowledged to be an excellent preacher and particularly effective in public disputations, so much so that the &#145;learned'st were even affraid to dispute with him&#146;  (Harington, 157&#150;8).<br>
<br>Still's intellectual abilities gave him his reputation and brought him preferment in both the university and the church. While a fellow of Christ's College, or perhaps while serving as a chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, Still had clearly impressed Parker, who preferred this young Cambridge don to a number of livings in his gift. On 30 July 1571 Still was appointed to the rectory of Hadleigh, Suffolk, an archiepiscopal peculiar. On 4 November 1572 he and Thomas Watts, archdeacon of Middlesex, were jointly appointed to oversee the archbishop's scattered peculiars in Essex and Suffolk, a jurisdiction known as the deanery of Bocking. On 18 July 1573 he was instituted to the vicarage of East Markham, Nottinghamshire, and in the same year became a canon of Westminster in place of the deprived Thomas Aldridge. In November 1573 Parker recommended Still to Burghley for the vacant deanery of Norwich, explaining that he regarded Still &#145;although so young to be more mortified than others of forty or fifty&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 450), but the request was not granted. In March 1577 Still was collated archdeacon of Sudbury in Suffolk.<br>
<br>These ecclesiastical preferments were more than matched by Still's promotions in Cambridge. On 25 October 1570 he was appointed Lady Margaret preacher and two months later became Lady Margaret professor of divinity in the place of Thomas Cartwright, who had been deprived on account of his presbyterian convictions; this post he held until 1573. On 14 July 1574, at the age of only about thirty, Still was elected master of St John's College, Cambridge, where he proved an able administrator and an astute financial manager. He was created DD in 1575 and on 4 November of that year was elected vice-chancellor. On 30 May 1577, in response to his own request, Still moved to become master of Trinity College, despite the objections of his predecessor, John Whitgift, that it was contrary to college statutes to appoint a married man to the position. At Trinity also he was a prudent manager of college estates. Still also succeeded in changing the length of appointment of master from seven years to life, which gave rise to the &#145;common saying that the College was a good horse but that it would kick till Still went to court and got new girts&#146;  (Pigot, 135).<br>
<br>Harington states that the &#145;Puritans in Cambridge wooed him, and would fayne have wonne him to their part&#146;. Still was certainly a signatory to a letter to the chancellor of the university, William Cecil, urging that Thomas Cartwright might be dealt with leniently, but he was no puritan, and since he had replaced Cartwright and Aldridge when they were deprived, evidently not seen as a puritan either. Both as rector of Hadleigh and as archdeacon of Sudbury, Still is likely to have been familiar with and perhaps sympathetic to the stance of the godly clergy of Suffolk while remaining a stout defender of conformity to the established church. Some fifteen years later, admittedly in the very different context of the Marprelate controversy, when Still was chosen to preach before convocation in February 1589, he sharply inveighed against those that sought a further reformation of the church. In the 1570s his defence of conformity and his frequent preferment left him open to the charge that he was ambitious for office; it was said in a sermon preached in Cambridge that &#145;some could not have a living worth &pound;100 a year, another worth &pound;120, but Still will have more&#146;  (Harington, 157&#150;8).<br>
<br>The 1580s represented a more settled period in Still's life in which he divided his time between Trinity College and his ministry in Hadleigh. Despite his duties elsewhere the rectory in Hadleigh was home. By 1574 he had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of Thomas Alabaster, a wealthy clothier of Hadleigh. Between 1575 and 1589 nine children, five sons and four daughters, were born and baptized in Hadleigh, three of them dying in infancy. Still took an active role in the affairs of this cloth-making town, meeting regularly with the churchwardens and chief bailiffs as they sought to establish innovative schemes to provide work and relief for the poor and for the &#145;restreynt of idle and evill disposed persons and roges in the said towne&#146;  (Pigot, 135). Still also took a particular interest in the grammar school in Hadleigh: promising pupils such as John Bois, later one of the translators of the Authorized Version, and John Overall, later bishop first of Coventry and Lichfield and then of Norwich, were recipients of his patronage. Another prot&eacute;g&eacute; was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/265/', "William Alabaster")</script>, his wife's first cousin. Even after Still moved to Wells, he retained lands in and around Hadleigh and in his will he left &pound;50 &#145;to the oulde poore people of Hadley in Suffolke as a token of my oulde love to the place of my mynisterye&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/111, fol. 275<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Still had been spoken of as a candidate for a bishopric as early as 1579 in a letter written by Gabriel Harvey to the earl of Leicester. In November 1592 Still was once again elected vice-chancellor of the university but served only part of the year as he was elected bishop of Bath and Wells under a <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> dated 16 January 1593. Following royal assent on 7 February, his election was confirmed on 10 February and Still was consecrated on the following day. He plunged into his new office with characteristic energy. The see had been left vacant since the death of Bishop Thomas Godwin in November 1590 and the diocese had suffered from neglect. Still commenced an episcopal visitation on 17 June 1594 and presided personally over the first main court for each deanery in order to set his stamp on the proceedings. The surviving records of the visitation provide ample proof of his determination to rule the diocese with care and moderation. By restraining manifestations of nonconformity through the 1590s, he was able to avoid substantial deprivations of clergy in the next decade. He worked closely at Wells with his chancellor, Francis James, appointed early in the episcopate, and when absent could rely on the deputizing activities of his chaplains. Two months after his consecration, Still lost his wife, Anne, who died on 15 April 1593, leaving him with six children under nineteen. Ever prudent, Still effected a strategic alliance with an influential and wealthy Somerset family. On 16 December 1594 he married Jane, daughter of Sir John Horner of Cloford, Somerset, who brought with her a dowry of &pound;1050 invested in the manor of Mourton Wroughton in Compton Martin and valuable connections in the local gentry community. The couple had one son, Thomas.<br>
<br>Still was probably a regular attender at quarter sessions and he was an active bishop in parliament, serving on no fewer than seven committees. In November 1597 he made proposals in convocation for the better keeping of parish registers and he attended convocation again in March 1604. He appears to have turned his considerable talent for profitable estate management to his episcopal estates and in so doing amassed a fortune, most notably from the profits of the Mendip lead mines but also from increasing the rents and imposing heavy fines for the renewal of leases. The best evidence of Still's wealth may be found in his lengthy will, drawn up on 4 February 1608, in which he bequeathed lands in Suffolk to his eldest son, Nathaniel, various estates in Somerset to sons John and Thomas, and a variety of cash sums (including a bequest of &pound;500 towards almshouses in Wells) that amounted to more than &pound;3000, as well as legacies of gilt vessels, silver bowls, rings, pewter, and tapestries. He left all his books to be equally divided between his three surviving sons urging them &#145;so farre as their occasions can convenientlie permytte&#146; to be &#145;studiouslie occupied in the readinge and studienge thereof especialie in the devine bookes of Godes holie Scriptures and dailie to meditate therein and to expresse the same in their godlye life and vertuous conversacion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/111, fol. 276), but none of his sons pursued clerical careers. Still died in the palace at Wells on 26 February 1608, having left 400 marks for funeral expenses. He was buried on 4 April in the cathedral, where an effigy of him in full academic dress with an inscription penned by William Camden stands hard by the steps leading to the chapter room. His widow died later that year and was buried on 29 September.<br>
<br>Often erroneously identified as the author of the boisterous comedy, <span class="italic">Gammer Gurton's Needle</span>, now convincingly ascribed to William Stevenson, Still was the author and composer of &#145;A hymne to be sung by all England&#151;women, youthes, clerkes and souldiers&#146;, dated 1588. Patriotically it invoked God's help against &#145;mercilesse Envaders&#146; asking that he &#145;sink deep their potent navies&#146; and &#145;their strength and courage break&#146;. Even if &#145;cruel Spain and Parma with heathen legions&#146; broke through, the English would not &#145;change our <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;; if Apollyon himself should come, &#145;His fiery darts we'll quell&#146;.<br>
