<span class="headword">Brackenbury,  Robert Carr</span>  (1752&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born at Panton House in Lincolnshire and baptized on 28 April 1752, the first child of Carr Brackenbury and Isabella, daughter of William Booth of Ashby Puerorum. He was educated at Felsted School and, from 20 May 1769, at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, which he entered with the intention of taking holy orders, but it was here that a spiritual crisis turned him from his original purpose. No more is known of his Cambridge days, and in 1776 he came under the influence of John Wesley.<br>
<br>From this time until the end of Wesley's life (1791) Brackenbury and Wesley met on several occasions at Brackenbury's home at Raithby in Lincolnshire, in addition to those occasions when Wesley invited Brackenbury to accompany him on his travels. In 1779 they went on a tour to Scotland, and twice (in 1783 and 1786) they journeyed to the Netherlands. In July 1779 Wesley paid his first visit to Raithby, while Brackenbury was building the hall that was to be his future home. On the estate Brackenbury built a small chapel over the stables, which Wesley opened. When Wesley visited Horncastle later the same year &#145;the wild men were more quiet than usual; I suppose, because they saw Mr Brackenbury standing by me, whom they knew to be in Commission for the Peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Wesley</span>, 6.242&#150;3). Wesley and Brackenbury also corresponded frequently. Brackenbury was one of a small number present at City Road, London, when Wesley died on 3 March 1791.<br>
<br>Brackenbury married twice. His first wife, Jane, died on 3 March 1782, at the age of twenty-four, &#145;after a short Life of great troubles and adversities&#146;, as her monument in Raithby church records. In 1795 Brackenbury married second Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1847) of Loughborough, daughter of Henry Holland, a captain in the Loughborough Volunteers.<br>
<br>Brackenbury's most important work as a Methodist preacher was in the Channel Islands, where he was sent by Wesley in 1783 at the request of soldiers who were stationed there. He worked there in the face of much opposition and spent money building chapels. In 1790 he returned to the mainland and met a Methodist from Frome who instructed him to visit and preach on the Isle of Portland. Brackenbury spent some time in Portland but moved to other places according to his own inclinations, building chapels at his own expense, helping others financially, and supporting many charities. He wrote poetry and several hymns. He was never ordained yet Wesley made him a member of the legal hundred and his name appeared in the minutes of conference along with all of Wesley's preachers.<br>
<br>Brackenbury's life was dogged by ill health, which affected his spiritual state and led to periods of depression. He was of a nervous disposition yet had great courage when faced with a violent crowd. Thomas Jackson, one of Wesley's preachers, described him thus:<blockquote>rather below the middle size, portly and well proportioned, with an open and placid countenance, rather reserved, but gentlemanly in his manners. In the pulpit his address was calm, but impressive; his sermons were received &hellip; by the Methodist congregations with gratitude and respect. (Jackson, 74&#150;5)</blockquote>There is no known portrait of him, except in silhouette.Brackenbury expressed a wish that nothing should be written about him after his death, with the result that his widow destroyed any material that would have been useful for a substantial biography. He died at Raithby on 11 August 1818 and was buried in the chancel of Raithby church, near his first wife. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> reported his death as being:<blockquote>In his 66<sup>th</sup> year &hellip; a celebrated character of the turf, though possessed of an ample future, he was for many years a zealous preacher among the Methodists, and is stated to have bequeathed &pound;1,600 for the spreading of the Gospel. (<span class="italic">GM</span>)</blockquote>His will, made in 1816, shows that he owned property in the Isle of Portland, Loughborough, Charnwood Forest, and a number of Lincolnshire villages, in addition to his home in Raithby.<br>
