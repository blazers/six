<span class="headword">Webb <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Child]</span>,  Lydia</span>  (1736/7&#150;1793), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, became one of the most popular actors of comic roles at the Haymarket and Covent Garden theatres. Nothing is known of her parents, nor has her forename been definitively established.<br>
<br>A Miss Child first appeared at the Norwich theatre on 17 March 1760. She went on to perform in many companies as far apart as Ipswich and Dublin, but, of the early part of her career, most is known about her work at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. Here she first appeared in 1772 using the name Mrs Day, but by 1774 she had taken the name of the company member &#145;Dicky&#146; Webb, and the couple acted there until 1779. Although as Mrs Day she had performed several serious roles at Edinburgh, ageing from Cordelia in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> to Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, as Mrs Webb she specialized in comedy roles, the most familiar now being Mrs Malaprop in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Mrs Peachum in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> (1777), Lucy in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, Mrs Frail in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, Mrs Hardcastle in Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (1778), and Mrs Candour in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1779).<br>
<br>It seems she and her second husband, Richard (Dicky) Webb, adopted a foundling daughter, whom Mrs Webb introduced to the public at the Haymarket Theatre in 1788. This daughter went on to become the second most popular actress of her time in America, after Anne Merry; her reputation there was made initially (from 1793) as Mrs (Thomas) Marshall, and then (from 1800) as Mrs Wilmot. The Webbs may also have had a son, if this was the Master Webb who danced at Covent Garden in 1791 and at the Haymarket in 1792. Mrs Webb first appeared at the Haymarket under the management of the elder George Colman in 1778 and at Covent Garden in 1779, and she worked the summer season at the Haymarket and the winter at Covent Garden until shortly before her death. Her background in playing musical roles and comic eccentricities made her useful to the management, and her skills helped to originate forty-three characters in new plays during these fifteen years. The jollity and generosity of character she shared with her husband must have endeared her to her audience. By 1778 she was already corporeally as large as her reputation was soon to become, for, like her husband, she apparently weighed at least 16 stone. Not only did her size support her stage presence, but also the power and resonance of her voice and clarity of enunciation, and these facts no doubt influenced the choice of Falstaff in <span class="italic">I Henry IV</span> as her benefit role in 1786. She was equally adept as a cheesemonger or a queen, and most of her London roles were in now long-since forgotten comedies, comic operas, farces, and musical farces, with the occasional prelude, interlude, and pastoral afterpiece.<br>
<br>This industrious woman was paid &pound;2 a week in 1779, which rose incrementally to &pound;5 in 1790. Her husband, however, died a debtor in the king's bench prison in July 1784, although they had apparently been living as a family at 15 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, from 1779 until 1782. Never more than a stone's throw from her place of employment, Mrs Webb was selling benefit tickets in 1787 from 22 Broad Court, Bow Street, Covent Garden, and in 1791 she was living at 19 Catherine Street, Strand. She apparently suffered a paralytic stroke, and died &#145;of a worn out constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1147) on 24 November 1793, aged fifty-six. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, despite her considerable income from the theatre, &#145;she was genteelly buried by the Theatrical Fund, and attended respectfully by those gentlemen to the church of St. Paul, Covent-garden&#146;  (ibid.); there is no record of her burial there.<br>
