</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Angus Frank Johnstone</span>  (1913&#150;1991), <span class="occ">novelist and biographer</span>, was born on 11 August 1913 at Dunscore, Dorset Road, Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, the sixth son of William Thomas Frank Johnstone-Wilson (1865&#150;1938), and Maud Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Caney (1867&#150;1929), daughter of a wealthy jeweller in Durban, South Africa. His father was from a border Scots landowning family and liked to call himself &#145;a gentleman of no occupation&#146;. By the time of Wilson's birth the family lived in half-raffish <i>rentier</i> poverty in the hotels of the English south coast. According to Wilson's memoir, &#145;Bexhill and after&#146;  (<span class="italic">Spectator</span>, 1958), it was an unhappy life for a lonely, late child, yet productive for storytelling; fantasy served to replace past glories. In 1922 his parents returned to Durban, where Wilson attended the Beres Road infants' school, witnessed the fading empire, and came under the influence of Kipling's Mowgli and Kim (he later wrote a fine book on Kipling). Dionysian recollections of this episode are found in an early story, <span class="italic">Union Reunion</span>.<br>
<br>Two years later the family returned to the hotels of Kensington and Wilson attended Ashampstead preparatory school in Seaford, owned and headmastered by his much older brother Winn. In 1927 he became a day-boy at Westminster School, London. His high-voiced manner and scruffy unconventional appearance were redeemed by skills of mimicry and story-telling, which had always been, he said, his histrionic family's stock-in-trade. Like Charles Dickens, the subject of another fine Wilson biography, he saw himself as odd, <i>declass&eacute;</i>, ever seeking out surrogate families. By the time he went to Merton College, Oxford, to read medieval history (1932&#150;5), he was well aware of his flamboyance, homosexuality (two older brothers were members of the gay community), and left-wing opinions. After a second-class degree and various odd jobs including working in a brother's restaurant, he joined the department of printed books at the British Museum as a cataloguer. If this was boring, he was also part of a camp, bohemian, left-wing scene. When the Second World War came, he was concerned in efforts to protect the library, until called for service in 1941. Like many academics and museologists, he was recruited for the codebreaking unit of the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (now world famous for decoding the Enigma machine) to work on Italian intercepts. He disliked the discipline and the place's intense competitive atmosphere, and an abortive love affair helped precipitate a breakdown. Writing was advised as therapy, so he experimented a little with fiction. In 1945 he returned to the British Museum, becoming assistant keeper, replacing the books destroyed in wartime bombing. There he met a young attendant, Anthony Charles Garrett (<i>b</i>. 1929), who became his lifelong partner.<br>
<br>In November 1946, at a house at Little Hadham which he shared with male friends, Wilson wrote &#145;Raspberry Jam&#146;, a story about two old ladies who kill a bullfinch. &#145;I sat down, as they say in the faith-healing testimonies, and &#147;just wrote a story one Sunday&#148;&#146;, he said in <span class="italic">The Wild Garden</span>  (p. 21). Another story, &#145;Mother's Sense of Fun&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">Horizon</span> in November 1947, under his pen-name Angus Wilson. In March 1949 Fred Warburg, on a hunch, published a collection of twelve stories, <span class="italic">The Wrong Set</span>, which included &#145;Raspberry Jam&#146;; a year later Secker and Warburg published another collection, <span class="italic">Such Darling Dodos</span>. Wilson's late fictional start represented a striking d&eacute;but. Post-war British fiction was recovering from war and the social transformations of the Labour government, and his stories were socially vivid, with a Waugh-like satirical edge, and a liberal reforming bite. They caught the post-war welfare state atmosphere of austerity, anxiety, dispossession, social unease and, end-of-empire bitterness; as privilege died, progressive hope rose, and fears of left-wing totalitarianism grew.<br>
<br>In 1949 Wilson was appointed deputy superintendent of the reading room, acquired a flat in Dolphin Square, and became known as a brilliant, distinguished literary figure. In 1952 he followed a study of &Eacute;mile Zola's novels with his own first novel, <span class="italic">Hemlock and After</span>, reputedly written in four weeks. As its Socratic title suggests, it is about the intellectual man of letters the middle-aged Bernard Sands, who attempts to found a writers' centre in welfare state Britain, but whose liberal&#150;progressive ideas conceal moral confusions and hypocrisies, cruelties, and sadisms. The book was acclaimed as a portrait of post-war society and a vivid moral analysis; Britain now found itself with an important new novelist, successor to Evelyn Waugh or E. M. Forster, both of whom seemed to influence him. Such was its success that Wilson felt able to risk becoming a freelance writer. He also had a favourable contract from Secker and Warburg and, in March 1955 resigned from the museum and, with Tony Garrett, moved to Felsham Woodside, a cottage amid woods and a much-loved wild garden near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with the plan for a yet more ambitious novel, <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Attitudes</span>.<br>
<br>If <span class="italic">Hemlock and After</span> is a fine work about the modern liberal dilemma, <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Attitudes</span> (1956) proved to be more than that: a sharply-observed and remarkable, panoramic portrait of a whole society. It is set around an archaeological fraud, the plot drawing on the Piltdown skull hoax of 1953; the deliberate falsification of history echoes the hypocrisy of modern British society and the moral illusions that prosper within it. A humanistic novel with a troubled academic hero, Gerald Middleton, it is also a vivid, satirical, wide-ranging portrait of striking, often self-corrupting communities from the academic world to the political, from bourgeois home life to homosexual underworlds. Its list of dramatic personae is long; as one critic observed, few novelists since Dickens had attempted work of such scale. Wilson was now a lively figure in the 1950s literary revolution. His play <span class="italic">The Mulberry Tree</span> (1956) was staged at the Royal Court Theatre in the same season as <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>. He helped younger writers, including his namesake Colin Wilson, who dedicated <span class="italic">The Outsider</span> (1956) to him. A writer frankly exploring homosexuality, he gave evidence to the Wolfenden committee; and publicly urged action upon its recommendations about homosexuality  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 March 1958). He began to travel extensively, performing brilliantly as a vivid impromptu speaker at many international events, including the PEN Club conference in Tokyo in 1957.<br>
<br>In 1957 Wilson published another story collection, <span class="italic">A Bit off the Map</span>; a year later came a new novel, the moving <span class="italic">The Middle Age of Mrs Eliot</span>. This story of a middle-aged woman, suddenly widowed in a senseless incident at a foreign airport, struggling to reconstruct her realities and make a new life, was an unexpected book. The heroine is ordinary yet powerfully present, the novel compassionate yet with satirical sparkle; it won a large audience. It represented a contribution to the socio-moral tradition of the English novel (the titular link with George Eliot is hardly accidental). After this novel David Farrer took over from Fred Warburg as Wilson's editor, and became a close friend. His next book, <span class="italic">The Old Men at the Zoo</span> (1961), revealed different qualities. Set in a future Britain as a new European war breaks out, it shows national collapse within a large institution, the London Zoo (a cross between the British Museum and Bletchley Park). The old men who run it are forlorn figures, obstinate, unable to face change, animals resembling the animals themselves. Reviewers were divided, some finding it a brilliant dystopian portrait of the British establishment, others an unsympathetic fantasy. Wilson was well aware of the contrast; he acknowledged (in &#145;The house of fiction&#146;, an interview with Frank Kermode) the double face of his writing, which displayed a George Eliot quality and &#145;mixed with it &hellip; a great lump of Dickensianism &hellip; I have got this &hellip; grand guignol side&#146;  (p. 122). The complex sources of fiction are the theme of the Ewing lectures he delivered at the University of California that year, expanded into a splendid psychological study of his writing process, <span class="italic">The Wild Garden</span>. As he reveals here his garden at Felsham Woodside was not only his &#145;principal pleasure&#146;  (p. 57), but also a &#145;prelapsarian&#146; refuge which provided him with a series of &#145;moral symbols&#146; which informed his work  (p. 62).<br>
<br>By now Wilson was probably Britain's most distinguished novelist and one of the most extensively travelled, regularly visiting Japan, India, Ceylon, the Mediterranean, the USA. Brilliant, witty, a splendid critic with a taste for the unusual or neglected (Samuel Richardson to J. C. Powys), he was in 1962 appointed part-time senior lecturer in English at the brand new University of East Anglia, Norwich, still choosing its first students. Many of these were attracted by the original academic programme, the emphasis on contemporary writing, and by Wilson himself. A charismatic teacher, he encouraged many aspiring writers, including Rose Tremain. In 1970 he founded the MA programme in creative writing with Malcolm Bradbury; Ian McEwan was the sole student in the first year of the programme. Appointed professor in 1967, Wilson served as public orator, and retired as emeritus in 1978. Many issues concerned him: support for public lending right, the interests of writers and writing, and homosexual law reform. He attended the Campaign for Homosexual Equality conference in Sheffield in 1975 with Tony Garrett and spoke publicly of their twenty-five-year relationship. He had made his homosexuality known at a time when very few public figures did so, although he was often distressed by the consequences (Garrett was forced to resign his position as a probation officer in 1960). He was deputy chair, then chair, of the Arts Council literature panel. He wrote extensive journalism, appeared on television, and lectured globally for the British Council. In 1969 he was made a CBE.<br>
<br>Two key novels of the 1960s repeated the pattern of alternating a traditional with an experimental novel. Though part written in Morocco, <span class="italic">Late Call</span> (1964) was a portrait of contemporary Britain, set in a new town in the era of planners, the comprehensive school, tower blocks, and the television soap. Again it centred on a striking heroine, Sylvia Calvert, a former servant whose life runs from the deferential rural England of Edwardian days to the planned new age. A large, humane social novel, it was widely acclaimed. <span class="italic">No Laughing Matter</span> (1968), remarkably different, has claim to being his most autobiographical, experimental, socially elaborate book. The story of the six children of the histrionic, dysfunctional Matthews family from 1912 to 1967, it makes fundamental use of techniques of parody and pastiche, travesty, self-mimicry; a polyphonic tale about the collapse of British bourgeois life into the world of modernity, it is also about the collapse of the solid bourgeois novel. Wilson became chairman of the National Book League, president of the Royal Society of Literature, and in 1975 chaired the Booker prize. Two notable literary biographies&#151;<span class="italic">The World of Charles Dickens</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">The Strange Ride of Rudyard Kipling</span> (1977)&#151;were separated by publication of <span class="italic">As If By Magic</span> (1973), an extraordinary &#145;global novel&#146; about the new generation of the 1960s, with a strong homosexual theme.<br>
<br>In 1980 Wilson was knighted, and he published his final novel, <span class="italic">Setting the World on Fire</span>, a social fable set around a great house in the heart of London, and a celebration of the fires of the imagination. Late in 1985, dismayed by Thatcher's Britain and its neglect of literature, he moved with Tony Garrett to an apartment in St Remy-de-Provence, France. He was diagnosed with a brain illness (hydrocephalus) which prevented him from writing. It brought extended mental and physical deterioration and severe financial difficulties as his reputation slipped in a fast-changing literary climate. In 1989 he came back to a nursing home, Pinfold End House, Hawstead, near Bury St Edmunds, where he died on 31 May 1991; he was cremated on 6 June at Risby crematorium, Suffolk. Over four decades his work had given contemporary fiction the scope, moral energy, historical and social curiosity, comic flamboyance of the classic British novel. Like himself, it was both very central and splendidly marginal: his fiction&#151;radical, satirical, polyvalent, sexually courageous, global&#151;extended the mainstream novel, and led it somewhere else. Still not fully recognized, he was one of Britain's greatest late-twentieth-century writers.<br>
