<span class="headword">Pelham,  John Thomas</span>  (1811&#150;1894), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was born on 21 June 1811, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21799/', "Thomas Pelham, the second earl of Chichester (1756&#150;1826)")</script>, and Lady Mary Henrietta Juliana Osborne (1776&#150;1862), daughter of the fifth duke of Leeds. He attended Westminster School and proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1829. He graduated BA in 1832, and received his MA and DD in 1857. He was made deacon by Bishop Blomfield of London in 1834 and priested in 1835.<br>
<br>Pelham's first charge was the parish of Eastergate in the diocese of Chichester, where he entered into what became a lifelong friendship with Henry Manning. In May 1837 the earl of Abergavenny presented him to the rectory of Bergh Apton, a small village near Norwich. He married, on 6 November 1845, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1893), second daughter of Thomas William Tatton of Wythenshawe Hall, Cheshire. In 1847 he was made honorary canon of Norwich Cathedral and became chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen. In 1852 he moved to the north of London to become perpetual curate of Christ Church, Hampstead, whose patron was Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson. After only three years he received the important crown living of St Marylebone on the recommendation of Lord Palmerston, who had just become prime minister. His ministry here was destined to be short, as in 1857 Palmerston nominated him to the see of Norwich, which was vacant by the resignation of Samuel Hinds. Lord Shaftesbury had originally suggested that Pelham should be considered for London (&#145;a fitter man could not be found in England&#146;) and that Tait should have Norwich, but other counsels prevailed. Palmerston accepted the advice that a forthright evangelical bishop of London would antagonize the Tractarians. Pelham was consecrated on 30 April 1857 by Archbishop J. B. Sumner and bishops A. C. Tait and C. R. Sumner. Pelham was bishop of Norwich for thirty-six years, which was longer than any of his predecessors except for Bishop Le Spencer, who held the see from 1370 to 1406.<br>
<br>As a bishop Pelham proved himself an able administrator and, though he rarely spoke in the House of Lords, unrivalled in the chairing of public meetings. He was a thoroughgoing pastoral bishop. In his first years of office he made rural deans the means of meeting with his clergy. In later times he visited them in a more systematic way. His custom was to spend a long weekend in each parish passing time with the clergyman's family, participating in the church services, and inspecting the Sunday and day schools. His constant activity even succeeded in stirring up the dormant energies of his senior clergy. Although of decidedly evangelical convictions he was conciliatory in his attitude to the high-church movement. In his diocesan charge of 1865 he dwelt on the current romanizing tendencies, but also referred to those of his clergy who undervalued the sacraments. He urged that holy communion services be held once a month and at festivals. Like other evangelicals of the period Pelham also advocated that baptism be held during public services. He pressed for the reform of convocation by consolidating the provinces of Canterbury and York and by extending the franchise to all licensed clergy in priests' orders. He urged the division of large dioceses, including his own, into smaller, more manageable units.<br>
<br>Pelham welcomed the 1870 <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span>, which he felt could bring great benefits to the church as a whole. Through a diocesan church association he provided the means for building and restoring churches, parsonages, and schools throughout the diocese. He also initiated a scheme to raise the stipend of the smaller benefices at the expense of part of his own income. Pelham was not given to the habit of writing and published little beyond his charges to the diocese. The text of a sermon he preached before the Church Missionary Society in May 1852 was printed in the same year. He also edited a small collection entitled <span class="italic">Hymns for Public Worship</span> in 1855.<br>
<br>Pelham resigned the see early in 1893. His wife died on 31 December 1893; he died at Thorpe, a suburb of Norwich, on 1 May 1894. He was a pastor of pronounced evangelical views which were coupled, according to the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>, with &#145;some ability, entire earnestness, and the manners and feelings of a gentleman&#146;. He left three sons and a daughter. The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35459/', "Henry Francis Pelham")</script>, became professor of ancient history at Oxford, and a fourth son, Herbert Pelham (1855&#150;1881), died after a climbing accident in the Alps.<br>
