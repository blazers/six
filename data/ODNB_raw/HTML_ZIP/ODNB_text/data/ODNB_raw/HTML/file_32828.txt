<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dillon,  Emile Joseph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>E. B. Lanin]</span>  (1854&#150;1933), <span class="occ">journalist and philologist</span>, was born in Dublin on 21 March 1854, the second son of Michael Dillon, a foundry and hardware merchant, and his wife, Mary Byrne. In accord with his father's wishes, Dillon studied for the priesthood in the Carmelite school and Holy Cross College in Dublin; he spent a further three years in St David's Monastery, Pentasaph, Wales, at the Grande Chartreuse, at the seminary of St Sulpice in Paris, and at the college of the Paulist Fathers in New York. At the age of twenty-one, he effectively abandoned theology to pursue his interest in oriental languages and returned to Paris; he worked briefly as assistant librarian in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale and began his philological studies under Ernest Renan at the Coll&egrave;ge de France. Encouraged by Renan, Dillon completed his study of Sanskrit, Arabic, and Hebrew at the University of Innsbruck. In 1875 he finally left the priesthood and moved to the University of Leipzig (where he was awarded a doctorate of philosophy).<br>
<br>During the late 1870s Dillon travelled in Europe and studied briefly at the universities of T&uuml;bingen, Louvain, St Petersburg, and Kharkov. He first visited Russia in 1877, when he was temporarily employed in Kiev as tutor in German to the sons of a Russian nobleman. From Kiev, he went to the University of St Petersburg to continue his studies of oriental languages and to obtain a teaching position, but he was denied a post because of his criticism of influential faculty members. He left for the University of Louvain, where he achieved a doctorate in oriental languages and literature and helped to found the literary review, <span class="italic">Le Mus&eacute;on</span>. Returning to St Petersburg in 1880, Dillon was briefly employed by a Russian newspaper; in 1881 he married a widow, Yelena Maksimovna Bogachova, who bore him four sons during the 1880s. By the early part of this decade Dillon possessed an excellent command of Latin, Greek, French, German, and Russian, and had mastered, among other languages, Sanskrit and Armenian; he claimed to speak twenty-six languages, and to be completely fluent in ten. With these qualifications he was appointed professor of comparative philology, Sanskrit, and ancient Armenian, at the University of Kharkov in 1884. He had already achieved renown for his translations of ancient Armenian manuscripts into Russian (which merited his election to the Armenian Academy in Venice) and studies on ancient Bactrian and Iranian languages, and the university awarded him a doctorate in comparative philology in 1884. But his promising academic career ended abruptly when he resigned in protest against the bureaucratic administration of the university.<br>
<br>In 1886 Dillon migrated to Odessa, where he became foreign editor of the liberal <span class="italic">Odessky Vestnik</span>, and later editor of the <span class="italic">Odesskiye Novosti</span>. After a year of conflicts with the censor, he moved to St Petersburg, where he began to contribute articles on Russia to the London press, and by the late 1880s had become well established as a journalist. During 1887 he was recruited by the proprietor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, Harry Lawson (later Lord Burnham), as the paper's correspondent in Russia, and in this capacity, and later as roving foreign correspondent, served the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> for almost three decades (until 1914). Soon after this arrangement was established, Dillon began to contribute monthly articles on Russia and foreign affairs to the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, <span class="italic">National Review</span>, <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, and some American periodicals. His &#145;Russian Characteristics&#146; series in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">National Review</span> (1889&#150;92), under the pseudonym E. B. Lanin, firmly established him as an authority on Russian affairs; his keen reporting and his subsequent exploits as a special correspondent inspired journalists such as W. T. Stead to acclaim him as Britain's premier foreign correspondent.<br>
<br>Dillon's most spectacular coup was his first-hand reporting for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> of the Turkish massacres of Armenians during 1894&#150;5. Barred from Armenia by the Turkish authorities, he slipped into the beleaguered region in various disguises and rendered harrowing descriptions of Turkish genocide, which aroused British public opinion and provided Gladstone with the evidence to indict the Turks for the Armenian &#145;horrors&#146;. Dillon's success in Armenia and his development of close contacts with statesmen and diplomats greatly enhanced his reputation as an innovative foreign correspondent, and persuaded the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> to permit him to undertake, on his own initiative, missions in Europe and Asia. Thus, in 1897, disguised as an Orthodox priest living with Cretan insurgents, Dillon reported the revolt in Crete against Turkish rule and, abetted by his close friend, the Greek patriot Eleutherios Venizelos, he served as an intermediary between the insurgents and the allied fleet coercing the Turks. During the following year Dillon reported the Spanish-American War from Madrid, and a year later (1899) was in France covering the second court martial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. From France he went to the Netherlands, where he reported the first Hague peace conference in 1899, and during 1900 was in China describing the Western powers' suppression of the Boxer uprising in Peking (Beijing).<br>
<br>Returning to his home in St Petersburg, Dillon became a firm friend and ardent advocate of the Russian finance minister and later (1905&#150;6) chief minister, Sergey Witte. In August 1905 Dillon accompanied Witte as publicity adviser to the Portsmouth peace conference, which ended the Russo-Japanese War, and contributed to influencing American public opinion on behalf of Russia. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Dillon sedulously reported what was occurring, and warned that, without such a progressive leader as Witte, Russia would be consumed by a bloody peasant upheaval; he subsequently bitterly assailed Tsar Nicholas II for dismissing Witte in 1906. Henceforth, Dillon was pessimistic about orderly reform in Russia and became increasingly concerned with the deteriorating international situation. In the Bosnian crisis of 1908&#150;9, his defence of his friend, the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, Count Alois L. von Aehrenthal, against the charges of the Russian foreign minister, Aleksandr Izvolsky, caused considerable embarrassment to the British Foreign Office. From 1909 to 1913 Dillon, accompanied by a bevy of pretty female secretaries, traversed the European capitals and covered the Balkan wars of 1912&#150;13. In 1913 he terminated his residence in Russia and divorced his wife, and in the following year married his long-time companion and secretary, Kathleen Mary Ireland of Belfast.<br>
<br>By this time Dillon had become overly opinionated and discursive and had outlived his value for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, which gradually ceased publishing his dispatches. Now the ageing &#145;greyish little man with a stubby beard and soft voice&#146; could no longer indulge his &#145;cloak and dagger&#146; complex and pose as a &#145;mystery man&#146;  (Burnham, 44, 47). Even so, many journalists and diplomats still respected his skill in getting everywhere and learning everything, his intimacy with prominent statesmen, his multi-lingual facility, and his realism. During 1915 he predicted the imminent collapse of Russia, and throughout the war and the ensuing peace conference (which he attended) was very pessimistic about Europe's prospects. Despairing of the future of Europe, he left for Mexico after the conference, hoping that the Mexican Revolution might provide some &#145;helpful hints and fruitful parallels&#146; for post-war Europe. On a brief visit to the United States and Mexico in 1920&#150;21, he found in President Alvaro Obr&eacute;gon another Witte; his view of the Mexican situation was set out in <span class="italic">Mexico on the Verge</span> (1921). Returning to Mexico in 1922, Dillon became a confidant of Obr&eacute;gon and served him as a contact with foreign oil corporations.<br>
<br>Plagued by ill health, Dillon returned to Europe in 1924 and settled at Barcelona. In 1928 he visited the Soviet Union and, although he admired some Bolshevik achievements, left lamenting that the old Russia he had known was now only a vague memory. By the time of his death on 9 June 1933, at 49 Calle Salud, Barcelona, Dillon had completed the book <span class="italic">Count Leo Tolstoy: a New Portrait</span> (1934), a lively account of his experiences and difficulties with Tolstoy, whose works he helped to translate and popularize in Britain. On his death, Dillon was remembered in Fleet Street as &#145;a man of mystery &hellip; whose business in life it was to know and understand foreign affairs in a way peculiar to himself&#146;  (Bentley, 318).<br>
