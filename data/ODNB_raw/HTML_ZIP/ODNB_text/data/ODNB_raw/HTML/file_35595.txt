<span class="headword">Power, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1916), <span class="occ">epidemiologist and civil servant</span>, was born at 1 Tillotson Place, London, on 15 December 1842, the eldest son of William Henry Power (1811&#150;1877), surgeon, and his wife, Charlotte Smart. He was educated at University College School, London, and was one of the fifth generation in his family to take up a medical career. After serving an apprenticeship with his father he undertook further study at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and in 1864 he qualified MRCS and LSA. In 1871, after various hospital appointments, he became an inspector in the medical department of the Local Government Board. He made his subsequent career within the department, becoming assistant medical officer in 1887 and medical officer in 1900. He retired in 1908, retaining an active interest in public health and epidemiology. On 8 June 1876 he married Charlotte Jane (1849/50&#150;1882), daughter of Benjamin Charles Godwin, a solicitor. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Power's distinctive abilities as an epidemiologist were demonstrated during his time as a medical inspector between 1871 and 1887. A keen ornithologist and the possessor of an extremely logical mind (there was a strong mathematical streak in the family), Power used his knowledge of natural history and his analytical abilities to elucidate the epidemiological puzzles presented to him. Four investigations from this period stand out for their original contributions to epidemiological knowledge. First, in 1876, his inquiry into a diphtheria outbreak at Brailes, Warwickshire, demonstrated not only that the disease was passed on mainly by personal contact, but also that the village day school had played a central part in the spread of the infection. As a result of this discovery, &#145;school influence&#146; was widely recognized as a critical factor in the spread of children's diseases. Second, between 1881 and 1886 Power was involved in investigating the causes and incidence of smallpox in London. He demonstrated an association between local incidence and isolation hospitals, which led to the latter being moved out of London. Third, and in these years also, he detected and described the transmission of streptococcal infections from cows to humans through milk from infected animals, at a time when bovine tuberculosis infection was still disputed, and the transmission route of Malta fever was as yet unknown. Finally, between 1887 and 1892 Power originated and co-ordinated an extensive investigation into lead poisoning through public water supplies derived from moorland sources, which had caused widespread plumbism in several Yorkshire cities. Also in 1887 he used his knowledge of natural history to resolve the longstanding problem of eels in the East London Water Company's water pipes.<br>
<br>Power's translation to &#145;headquarters&#146; work in 1887 ended his active career as an epidemiologist. From then on he concentrated his energies on educating and assisting the department's junior staff, and in consolidating the wider work of the department. He fostered among the staff a policy of inquiring so thoroughly into subjects that its investigations became standard works, and as back-up to the royal commission on sewage disposal he supported a scientific research programme that revolutionized the understanding and practice of sewage disposal. He was instrumental in guiding the Local Government Board to the creation of the sub-department of food inspection in 1905, and he took an active part in the royal commission on tuberculosis. Yet Power's profile during his years at the centre of public health administration was decidedly low: contemporaries were unanimous in the opinion that the extent of his influence on international public health was immense, but that it would never be fully known or appreciated. Power loathed publicity of any kind; he would accept no acknowledgement of his work or assistance; he would not appear at any occasion where he would be prominent before an audience; and he would not allow himself to be photographed.<br>
<br>Despite Power's intensely private attitude he received due recognition from his peers. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1895, created CB in 1902, and knighted on his retirement in 1908. He was a formidable figure&#151;6 feet 5 inches tall, with a fine physique; in his youth he had a distinguished sporting record. His favourite recreation was duck shooting from a small yacht off the east coast, and in retirement and illness his principal occupation was the study of birds through a pair of powerful field-glasses. He died at his home, Holly Lodge, East Molesey, Surrey, on 28 July 1916, and was buried on 1 August at Brookwood cemetery, Woking.<br>
