<span class="headword">Bold,  Henry</span>  (1627&#150;1683), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Hampshire, the fourth son of Captain William Bold of Newstead in Hampshire, a descendant of the ancient Lancashire family of Bold of Bold Hall. He was educated at Winchester College, before proceeding to New College, Oxford, where he was elected a probationer fellow in or about 1645. From this position he was removed three years later by the parliamentary visitors, later settling in London and becoming a member of the examiner's office in the court of chancery.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Wit a Sporting in a Pleasant Grove of New Fancies</span> (1657) was the first work to appear under Bold's initials but the volume is a comprehensive piracy. The portrait placed before the title-page, for example, professes to represent Bold but in fact depicts Christian Ravus, or Ravius, whose likeness had originally prefixed his <span class="italic">Discourse of the Oriental Tongues</span> (1649). The text itself also appropriates the work of others. Much of the first fifty pages is taken <i>verbatim</i>, but in a reordered sequence, from the secular section of Thomas Beedome's <span class="italic">Poems Divine and Humane</span> (1641); Robert Herrick's <span class="italic">Hesperides</span> (1648) is the source for many more items scattered throughout the rest of the volume. In making those poems his own, Bold regularizes Beedome's spelling and changes the names of the addressees (and, thus, the titles), lineation, and even the wording of Herrick's verse.<br>
<br>Bold's second collection was <span class="italic">Poems Lyrique, Macaronique, Heroique, &amp;c.</span> (1664), dedicated to Colonel the Hon. Henry Wallop, of Farley Wallop in Hampshire. The first half is devoted to lyric verse self-consciously Cavalier in its idiom<blockquote>
<div>(Tush! Love or say thou <i>wilt not</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>I'me <i>content!</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>'Tis, but an <i>hour</i>, idely <i>spent.</i>)<br>
</div> (&#145;Song XXVIII&#146;, p. 38)</blockquote>The second half contains a more various selection of occasional verse and longer poems, as well as a number of epitaphs, elegies, and translations from Latin, and, further, a series of poems on the Restoration first published as separate pamphlets or single sheets and including &#145;To his Sacred Majesty Charles the Second, at his Happy Return&#146; (1660), &#145;On the Thunder Happening after the Solemnity of the Coronation&#146; (1661), and &#145;Satyr on the Adulterate Coyn Inscribed the Common-Wealth, &amp;c.&#146; (1661). The volume concludes with the words &#145;Expect the second Part&#146;  (p. 236), but no second part is known; the final title to be published under Bold's name was <span class="italic">Latine Songs, with their English, and Poems</span> (1685), a posthumous gathering of the poet's papers collated by his brother William. The collection offers Latin versions of a number of English songs in facing-page translations, including a spirited run through &#145;Chevy Chace&#146; composed at the request of the bishop of London, and an elegant rendering of Suckling's song &#145;Why so pale and wan, fond lover?&#146;. The contents of the rest of the volume are similar in both matter and manner to the work Bold published during the Restoration. &#145;Song XXIV: an Ode&#146;, for instance, is a simple statement of first principles:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">The Royal line,<br>
</div>
<div>Heaven doth dispose of. 'Tis not theirs or mine,<br>
</div>
<div>But his by whom Kings Rule, and are Divine.<br>
</div> (p. 108)</blockquote>Bold died in Chancery Lane on 23 October 1683 and was buried at West Twyford, near Acton.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_2788"></a><span class="headword">Henry Bold</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1677) graduated BD from Christ Church, Oxford, on 5 July 1664, while chaplain to the earl of Arlington, by whose influence he subsequently became a fellow of Eton College and chanter in Exeter Cathedral. Wood reports that he died at Montpellier in late September or early October 1677.<br>
