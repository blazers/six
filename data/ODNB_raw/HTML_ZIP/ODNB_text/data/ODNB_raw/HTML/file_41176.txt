<span class="headword">Frye,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1474/5), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is first recorded in 1456&#150;7, when he joined the Confraternity of St Nicholas, the London guild of parish clerks. His fellow members included the composers John Bedyngham, John Plummer, and Richard Cox. This shared membership is especially interesting since the latter two composers and Frye were between them responsible for the five mass settings which form the original nucleus of the Burgundian court manuscript Brussels, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, MS 5557, with Frye himself the author of three masses. In the year 1464&#150;5 Frye was paid an annuity by Anne, duchess of Exeter, sister of Edward IV. Here again the Brussels manuscript provides an interesting perspective: it was compiled for the marriage of Margaret of York, also a sister of Edward IV, to Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, in 1468. Limited though the direct evidence is, then, it seems clear that Frye had connections with the royal court. His will, which survives, is dated 12 August 1474. It was proved at the prerogative court of Canterbury in London on 5 June 1475, thus placing his death some time during the intervening ten months. He died in London.<br>
<br>While there is no evidence that Frye ever worked abroad, his fame extended throughout Europe: his brief but very beautiful <span class="italic">Ave regina celorum</span> enjoyed unparalleled popularity in the second half of the fifteenth century, turning up in sources as far away from England as Bohemia and Hungary. It is also to be found, sung by angels, in three altarpieces painted in Bruges apparently in the 1480s, and even forms part of a ceiling painting in a French ch&acirc;teau. Of the few other secular works ascribed to Frye, most have conflicting attributions to others: these include the highly popular &#145;Tout a par moy&#146;, which may be by the Burgundian Gilles Binchois, and &#145;So ys emprentid&#146;, which is more likely to be by Bedyngham.<br>
<br>By far the most substantial part of Frye's output are his settings of the ordinary of the mass. The survival of Brussels MS 5557, without which all his complete masses would have been lost, is therefore especially fortunate. These are works of very high quality, and at least two of them, the <span class="italic">Summe trinitati</span> and <span class="italic">Flos regalis</span>, rank among the finest mass cycles of the mid-fifteenth century. To modern ears the subtle interplay of melodic and rhythmic ideas which shape and lend a sense of structural balance to the masses offers ever deeper rewards with growing acquaintance. While these works were probably composed in the early to mid-1460s, the style of Frye's other complete mass, the <span class="italic">Nobilis et pulchra</span>, points to an earlier date, possibly in the early 1450s, and thus about the same time or slightly later than the masses of Bedyngham, who was apparently a somewhat older contemporary. A partially preserved mass based on the song &#145;So ys emprentid&#146; is ascribed to Frye in the fragmentary manuscript known as the Lucca choirbook. Strong similarities between this and an anonymous mass in Brussels 5557 suggest that the latter may also be by Frye, a conclusion supported by further stylistic links with Frye's mass style generally, and with his motet <span class="italic">Sospitati dedit</span>. This piece is the only one by Frye to survive complete in a source from his native country, where most music manuscripts for this period have sadly been lost.<br>
