<span class="headword">Cornell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gunn]</span>,  Muriel Amy</span>  (1906&#150;1996), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born on 27 September 1906 at 2 Western Road, Mitcham, Surrey, the daughter of Frederick William Gunn, master grocer, and his wife, Beatrice Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Loosemore. She attended Wimbledon county school, where athletics was not part of the curriculum, and came to the sport via her brother and her fianc&eacute;, Stanley Herbert (Stan) Cornell (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), a brush manufacturer (the son of Herbert Cornell, an accountant). Both men were founder members of Mitcham athletic club. In 1926 they encouraged her to join the newly formed women's section and, although she regarded herself primarily as a sprinter, she entered and won the long jump at an internal club competition in June of that year. Intrigued by her success&#151;obtained despite being tired after running the 220 yards&#151;she put in some practice, during which she leapt further than the existing world record. Mitcham's secretary then persuaded the organizer of that summer's British games at Stamford Bridge to include a woman's long jump, at which she broke the world mark officially.<br>
<br>Within two months of taking up long jumping, Muriel Gunn was representing Britain at the second women's world games at G&ouml;teborg in Sweden. However, her inexperience let her down. A potential winning leap was reduced by her leaving a mark in the sand behind her actual landing point when she turned to speak to an official before leaving the pit. She and the winner, the Japanese Kinui Hitomi, exchanged the world record several times during the 1920s. Domestically her British all-comers record of 19 feet 2&frac12; inches, which she set at Birmingham in 1930 in a match against Germany, remained intact for twenty-three years. Before this she had increased the mark five times since she first broke the record. She married Stan Cornell on 15 August 1928.<br>
<br>Muriel Cornell was not just a long jumper. At the Women's Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championships she won the 100 metres hurdles in 1927, the 100 yards in 1928, and the 80 metres hurdles in 1930. In 1928 she broke the world record for the 80 metres hurdles in the semi-final but was beaten in the final itself. Of course her forte was the long jump, for which she held the title from the inaugural Women's AAA meeting in 1927 through to 1931.<br>
<br>Cornell performed poorly at the trials for the Los Angeles Olympics of 1932, a matter later explained as being due to pregnancy. In January 1933 she gave birth to a daughter, Lorna, and then returned to competitive athletics, one of the first mothers to resume high standard track and field. Nevertheless a snapped Achilles tendon in a hurdle race ended her career as an athlete. She remained in the sport as a coach and administrator, serving for eleven years as secretary to the Women's AAA and managing the women's team at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.<br>
<br>Cornell's seventieth birthday party was attended by Olympian Harold Abrahams, who presented her with a gold medal inscribed &#145;from a fellow long jumper&#146;. She herself was never able to jump at the Olympics, as the long jump did not become a recognized event for women until the London games in 1948. She died on 8 March 1996 of pneumonia, in the East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, Surrey. Her husband predeceased her.<br>
