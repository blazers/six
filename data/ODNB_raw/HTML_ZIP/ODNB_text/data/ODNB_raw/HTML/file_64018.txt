<span class="headword">Sparks,  Hedley Frederick Davis</span>  (1908&#150;1996), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born on 14 November 1908 at 2 Sydner Road, South Newington, London, the only child of the Revd Frederick Sparks (1847&#150;1908), curate of West Hackney, and his second wife, Blanche Barnes (1871&#150;1951), daughter of William Jackson. His father died about six weeks before Sparks was born, and his mother was left in straitened circumstances. He was educated at St Edmund's School, Canterbury (where tuition, lodging, food, and clothing during term time was provided by the Clergy Orphan Corporation) and at Brasenose College, Oxford. He took a first in theology in 1930 and various university prizes, a BD in 1937, and a DD in 1949. Ordained deacon in 1933, he combined a curacy at the City Church with work on the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> and a (non-stipendiary) chaplaincy at Ripon Hall, where he had done his ordination training. The increasingly strident tone of the Modern Churchmen's Union and its links with Ripon Hall led to his resignation in 1936. He was, however, later chairman of the governors. From 1936 to 1946 he was lecturer in the theology department at Durham University; he took an active part in the maintenance of discipline in the absence of lay colleagues during the Second World War, and enjoyed doing so. He then went to Birmingham as the first Cadbury professor of theology (1946&#150;52); there he developed the syllabus and gave the faculty an ecumenical basis, breaking new ground in the appointment of a Roman Catholic (H. Francis Davis) as lecturer. In 1952 he became Oriel professor of the interpretation of holy scripture in Oxford. Although he regretted the severance of the chair from a canonry at Rochester, the appointment fulfilled a long ambition. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1959. Until her death in 1951 he had provided a home for his mother. On 25 August 1953 he married Margaret Joan (<i>b</i>. 1930), daughter of C. H. Davy. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1976 he retired to Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1933 Sparks was recruited by H. J. White, dean of Christ Church, to assist him on the critical edition of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> <span class="roman">New Testament</span> begun by J. Wordsworth. The first fascicule of the work had been published in 1889; by 1926 it had reached <span class="roman">2 Corinthians</span>. Sparks helped White with the proofs of <span class="roman">Ephesians</span> (published with <span class="roman">Galatians</span> in 1934) and after White's death became editor, originally under the supervision first of F. C. Burkitt and then of B. H. Streeter, but from 1937 on his own. He completed volume 2 in 1941 and the final volume in 1954. Towards the end there was an increasing amount of work to be done, since some of the collations he inherited were incomplete and there were more patristic commentaries to be incorporated. Sparks in turn recruited the assistance of A. W. Adams, who helped with the proofs from <span class="roman">2 Timothy</span> onwards and to whom Sparks handed over the editorship of the Johannine epistles. In 1942 Sparks was asked to help with what became known as the <span class="roman">Critical Greek Testament</span>. This project dated back to 1926 and the volumes on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">Mark</span> had already been published. <span class="roman">Luke</span> was eventually to appear in two parts in 1984&#150;7. Sparks was responsible for the citations of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> and for part of the Old Latin material (in connection with which he went to Beuron in 1976 and 1977). From 1959 he was also involved with the preparation of the Stuttgart edition of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> (published in 1969).<br>
<br>Apart from his work on the Latin text of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Sparks was engaged on two other long-term projects. His <span class="italic">Synopsis of the Gospels</span> (in English) showed not only the parallels between different sections in the synoptic gospels but also parallels between identical and alternative words or phrases within the sections, and included the Johannine parallels. Part 1 appeared in 1964, part 2 in 1974, with <span class="roman">John</span> printed as the main text and the synoptic parallels noted on the right-hand side of the page. <span class="italic">The Apocryphal Old Testament</span> (1984 [actually 1985]) was designed as a handy replacement for the work of R. H. Charles, published in 1913. Omitting the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, it contained revisions of the translations by Charles or new translations, with some new items; while the translations were the work of different scholars, the introductions and bibliographies were all done by Sparks, providing the book with uniformity and a high standard of accuracy. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Old Testament in the Christian Church</span> (1944), <span class="italic">The Formation of the New Testament</span> (1952), and a number of learned articles in journals, contributed to various co-operative enterprises, including <span class="italic">Chambers' Encyclopedia</span> and <span class="italic">The Cambridge History of the Bible</span>, and was responsible for the biblical material (in a wide sense) in the second edition of <span class="italic">The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</span>.<br>
<br>Beyond the field of textual criticism, Sparks exercised wide influence through his teaching, his wise counsel in the bodies with which he was associated, and his editorship of the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span> from 1954 to 1977. He recruited Henry Chadwick, then young and little known, as co-editor, insisting that they should appear as equals. For twenty-four years he devoted infinite care to the journal, teaching generations of beginners how to handle and present scholarly material, and reading with a sharp and critical eye the whole of every issue. In Oxford he was but one of eight professors of theology, but his sane views carried weight in the affairs of both faculty and college. From 1961 to 1968 he was also rector of Wytham; until 1975 he usually took a locum during the long vacation and almost everywhere he lived he regularly helped with services in church. His strong sense of duty found expression in meticulous scholarship and an expectation of high standards in others (coupled with a certain intolerance when these were not met), and in a pastoral care even for the most unattractive. He was short in stature, but could dominate an audience. He was devoted to railways and music, and was a good practical gardener. He died on 22 November 1996 in the Nunnery Fields Hospital, Canterbury, and was buried on 28 November in New Romney churchyard, after a funeral service in Canterbury Cathedral. He was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
