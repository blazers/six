<span class="headword">Domnall Brecc</span>  (<em>d.</em> 642/3), <span class="occ">king of D&aacute;l Riata</span>, was overking of the Dalriada in Scotland and Ireland [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata, kings of")</script>]. The epithet Brecc, usually translated &#145;the Freckled&#146;, taken together with the name of his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8929/', "Eochaid Buide, &#145;the Yellow&#146;")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata, kings of")</script>], suggests a fair family complexion. In 622 Domnall is said to have fought at Cend Delgthen (probably in Meath) in an internal conflict between southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. His motives are unknown, but this is the only recorded battle in which he was on the winning side.<br>
<br>Eochaid Buide died about 629. His successor, Connad Cerr, was, according to one group of texts, a brother of Domnall, but there is more convincing evidence that Connad belonged to the Comgall (Cowal) branch of the Dalriada in Britain. He died in the same year, in Ireland. His successor is said to have been his son Ferchar, but there is evidence that Ferchar's reign came later, and that Connad's immediate successor was Domnall Brecc.<br>
<br>A badly displaced annal, which may belong to <i>c</i>.635, records a defeat of Domnall Brecc &#145;in Calathros&#146;  (A. O. Anderson, 1.158), apparently a district near Loch Awe. In 637 Congal C&aacute;ech, the overking of the Ulaid in north-east Ireland, was attacked by the head of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, Domnall, son of &Aacute;ed. In the battle of Moira, in Down, Congal was killed. Domnall Brecc had been his ally, and, though apparently not personally present at Moira, was said to have wasted the province of Domnall son of &Aacute;ed. His abandonment of his family's traditional loyalty to the family of &Aacute;ed was thought to have brought about the fulfilment of a prophecy made by Columba to Domnall's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/222/', "Aed&#225;n (or &#193;edan) mac Gabr&#225;n")</script> (though not, apparently, in Domnall Brecc's lifetime).<br>
<br>After 637 there is no word of Domnall Brecc in Ireland. In 638 there was a &#145;battle of Glenn Mureson in which Domnall Brecc's people fled&#146;  (A. O. Anderson, 1.163); the place is unidentified, but is assumed to be in Scotland. His last battle was fought in December of 642 or 643 in Strathcarron, east of the Kilsyth hills, against Owen, king of the Dumbarton Britons. A fragment of Welsh panegyric verse (the <span class="italic">Gododdin</span>) says that Domnall was killed after he had &#145;fired&#146; a British &#145;town&#146;, and adds, with a note of exultation, that &#145;the head of Domnall Brecc, ravens gnawed it&#146;  (Jackson, 47). The cause of the affair is unknown, but it should perhaps be placed within the context of a struggle for supremacy between D&aacute;l Riata and Dumbarton.<br>
<br>From 637 Domnall Brecc seems to have had to share the overkingship of the Dalriada with Ferchar, Connad Cerr's son. After Domnall's death, Ferchar reigned alone until he died, probably about 651. Domnall left at least two sons: Cathusach, who died in 650, and Domangart, who reigned from 660 to 673 and was the ancestor of the later Scottish kings.<br>
