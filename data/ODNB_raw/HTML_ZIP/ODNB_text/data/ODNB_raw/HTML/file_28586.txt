<span class="headword">Walmsley <span class="st"> [Walmesley]</span>, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1537&#150;1612), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest of the ten children of Thomas Walmsley (<i>d</i>. 1584) of Showley Hall, Clayton-le-Dale, Lancashire, and Margaret Livesey. Having entered Lincoln's Inn in 1559, he was called to the bar in 1567 and made a bencher of the inn in 1574. He was Lent reader in 1578 and autumn reader in 1580, when he was created serjeant-at-law. In 1589 he was made a judge of the court of common pleas, which place he continued to occupy until his death. Walmsley was undoubtedly a very capable lawyer&#151;in 1603, the year he was knighted, Robert Cecil ranked him alongside the two chief justices for learning&#151;though he was in a very conservative mould: he resisted to the end what he regarded as undesirable developments in the common law, sometimes continuing his grumbling opposition long after they had become settled law. He was not a man to succumb to pressure to conform to the opinions of others. In 1591, early in his judicial career, he earned a royal reprimand for allowing bail to a prisoner accused of murder, contrary to the express instructions of the queen. Nowhere was his independence of mind more visible than in <i>Calvin's case</i> (1608), when the judges were required to determine whether a Scot born after the accession of James I was a naturalized Englishman. Alone among the judges giving advice to the House of Lords, Walmsley refused to accept this, maintaining his dissent in the court of exchequer chamber.<br>
<br>Walmsley retained strong Lancashire links throughout his life, representing the county in the parliament of 1589. His marriage <i>c</i>.1570 to Anne Shuttleworth (<i>d</i>. 1635) brought him an estate at Hacking, though not without litigation against her family; and in 1571 he bought the lands and mansion at Dunkenhalgh which were to be his principal home for the rest of his life. He continued to invest heavily in lands in Lancashire and in Yorkshire; according to the account of one of his descendants, Walmsley's expenditure on land in the course of his lifetime was in excess of &pound;30,000. To the rentals from these estates and his earnings from legal practice, he added a steady stream of income from moneylending. Tradition has it that his dealings were not always fair; and his surviving account books suggest that he was, at the least, a tough dealer not given to magnanimous gestures where business was concerned. On the other hand, he was actively involved in charitable works, most notably as a governor of the grammar school at Blackburn.<br>
<br>Walmsley's wife, who survived him by many years, was an unashamed recusant, and although perhaps not a practising Catholic himself, Walmsley was generally thought to have been actively sympathetic to their cause. During his time as justice of assize on the northern circuit (1589&#150;91) the anti-Catholic legislation was enforced with the gentlest of hands, though protestant nonconformists were treated with firmness. It was perhaps because of this that he was moved in quick succession to the home circuit, then to the midland, and then to the west (where he could be watched over by the orthodox chief justice Sir Edmund Anderson). He returned to the northern circuit to ride with John Savile in 1602, and once again brought comfort to the Catholics and consternation to their opponents.<br>
<br>In his later years Walmsley suffered from palsy and was plagued by gout. He died at Dunkenhalgh on 26 November 1612, at the age of seventy-five. His funeral was a lavish affair, with well over 2000 guests at the funeral feast, and many hundreds of pounds expended on mourning black. Buried at Blackburn beneath a handsome monument, which was largely destroyed in 1625, Walmsley was a local hero in northern Lancashire; the inn named in his memory at Whalley has survived to the present day.<br>
