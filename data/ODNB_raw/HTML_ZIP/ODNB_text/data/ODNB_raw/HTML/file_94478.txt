<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carpenter,  Humphrey William Bouverie</span>  (1946&#150;2005), <span class="occ">author, broadcaster, and musician</span>, was born on 29 April 1946 at the Radcliffe Maternity Home, Oxford, the only child of Harry James Carpenter (1901&#150;1993), warden of Keble College and later bishop of Oxford, and his wife, Urith Monica, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trevelyan (1909&#150;1995), a Froebel-trained teacher who went on to read English at Oxford. He grew up in an atmosphere of purposeful activity, mental and physical, and was encouraged by his mother in particular to take his own line and think for himself. Contemporaries remembered a small, determined figure tricycling round the Keble quadrangle and lighting up pantomimes with spirited and mischievous performances. He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford (at the time offbeat and bohemian in character), at Marlborough College, where he was less comfortable, and at Keble College, Oxford, where he read English. He followed this with a year's teacher training in Oxford, but in 1968 accepted a BBC general traineeship, with placements in television, regional news, the World Service, and (the then experimental) local radio.<br>
<br>Carpenter's crackling intelligence and fluency could have taken him a long way inside the BBC, but in 1970 he chose to return to his beloved Oxford to work on the fledgeling BBC local radio station, where he moved with ease between serious and intellectual programming, surreal comedy, and a manically giggly disc-jockey show entitled <span class="italic">Humf</span>. On 31 March 1973 he married a colleague at that radio station, Mari Christina Prichard (<i>b</i>. 1947), daughter of the Welsh poet and novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61284/', "Caradog Prichard")</script>. They had two daughters, Clare (<i>b</i>. 1978) and Kate (<i>b</i>. 1981), and lived at 5 Polstead Road, Oxford, until 1977, 61 Observatory Street until 1980, and then 6 Farndon Road until the end of his life. All these homes lay within a small patch of north-west Oxford, where he was a familiar part of the community, singing in the St Barnabas church choir intermittently for much of his life, although his formal religious belief ran out, according to close friends, around 1980 (when he was working on the Oxford University Press <span class="roman">Past Masters</span> biography of Jesus).<br>
<br>From the mid-1980s Carpenter ran, with considerable brio, a children's theatre group called Mushy Pea. &#145;It is not&#146;, he said, &#145;a kind deed to be looking after other people's children on Saturday mornings. It is a way of getting my own works performed by enormous casts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 May 1993). His taste for the music and shows of the first half of the twentieth century found a spectacular outlet when in 1993&#151;largely at his own expense and with the observation that &#145;oh, some people spend that kind of money on a car&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;he took a company of some sixty children to perform two of his shows at the Shaw Theatre in London. The youngest of the cast was only four years old. One show was <span class="italic">Mr Majeika: the Musical</span>, based on his own children's books, the other <span class="italic">Babes</span>, about the lives of Hollywood child stars. Both his daughters performed, the younger doing a startlingly Mermanesque impression of Ethel Meglin, dance school proprietress.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, however, Carpenter's work as a biographer was flourishing. After his authorized biography of J. R. R. Tolkien (1977) he turned to group biography, evoking with great skill C. S. Lewis's Oxford friends (in <span class="italic">The Inklings</span>, 1978, which won the Somerset Maugham award). Later he was to do the same with American writers in 1920s Paris (<span class="italic">Geniuses Together</span>, 1987), the Evelyn Waugh circle (<span class="italic">The Brideshead Generation</span>, 1989), the 1960s satirists (<span class="italic">That Was Satire That Was</span>, 2000), and the 1950s rebels (<span class="italic">Angry Young Men</span>, 2002). It is significant that he excelled in this area, for sociability was one of his most marked characteristics. John Walsh, the journalist, observed that &#145;He loved company, harmony, communion, the humming convivium of a party, the shared endeavour of musicians, the sight and sound of human beings working together&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). With his wife, Mari, he edited the <span class="italic">Oxford Companion to Children's Literature</span> (1984) and a year later published <span class="italic">Secret Gardens</span>, a study based on a lifelong interest in the personalities and beliefs of children's authors in the &#145;golden age&#146;. He began to write his own books for children with <span class="italic">The Joshers</span> (1977) and from 1984 the Mr Majeika series, about an irrepressible, eccentric, and accident-prone wizard working as a primary school teacher.<br>
<br>Carpenter's individual biographies included those of W. H. Auden (1981, which won the E. M. Forster award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters), Ezra Pound (1988, which won the Duff Cooper memorial prize), Benjamin Britten (1992), Robert Runcie (1996), Dennis Potter (1998), and Spike Milligan (2003), but in the course of writing them he confessed that he often discovered such marvellous stories that it was a torment to keep them to himself until publication, and he was tempted to tell all at parties. Sometimes he did. Some attacked him for his breezy openness about the sexual oddities of his subjects, notably Britten and Potter, and his inclusion of remarks by Runcie that were indiscreet, though not &#145;off the record&#146;, caused the latter some embarrassment; but his research was rigorous, his sources solid, and if there was a difference between him and those who criticized him it was that he was slower to condemn the strange byways down which life leads nervous and creative people. It was notable that even if his work was treated intemperately by rival writers, he managed to forget the slight and return to cordial relations with them in no time. As one contemporary said, &#145;He didn't do feuds, he didn't do grudges&#146;  (private information). His family life was conspicuously happy and stable.<br>
<br>Carpenter's performing career continued through much of his life; he was a regular radio presenter on Radio 3 and Radio 4, and in 1983 he founded Vile Bodies, a mixed group of professionals and amateurs who played dance music and jazz from the 1920s to the 1940s. This combo had a residency at the Ritz Hotel in London from 1987 to 1994, thus providing possibly the only opportunity to see a leading literary biographer and arts broadcaster wrapped up in a giant sousaphone under pink lighting. In 1994 he became programme director of the Cheltenham literary festival for three years, and livened up the hitherto rather staid world of English literary festivals by introducing jazz, cartoonists, and numerous children's and science events, in between the interesting unknowns and the literary and intellectual big-hitters. He often personally chaired sessions, rushing from room to room in a happy blur. His own book reviews were acute, occasionally mischievous, but generous in spirit.<br>
<br>Suffering from Parkinson's disease in the last years of his life, characteristically Carpenter continued working, kept quiet about it as long as he could, and gathered information and helpful gadgets. He also began writing a musical about the illness entitled <span class="italic">Shake it all About</span>, with a lament on the difficulty of &#145;putting on my socks&#146; set to the tune of &#145;Puttin' on the Ritz&#146;. After his sudden death from a heart attack on 4 January 2005 (he was pronounced dead at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford) it was performed by his friends as a fundraiser for a project on public awareness of the illness. He was buried on 14 January in Wolvercote cemetery. His untimely death brought an avalanche of tributes from friends, all trying to evoke the vivid, beaky, dishevelled tornado that was Humphrey Carpenter. One fellow church choir singer wrote, &#145;He is the only person I know competent to sing any of the four parts of choral music&#151;treble, alto, tenor or bass&#146;, adding that &#145;during the more boring parts Humphrey, naughty choirboy of 34, his uncombed mop poking from his surplice, could be seen bent over a novel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>). Another observed, &#145;he seemed to want to clasp the world to his manly bosom, gleefully, greedily, to have as much going on simultaneously as one life could bear&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). His wife, Mari (who survived him, along with their two daughters), oversaw the publication of his final works. Two were published posthumously: the fourteenth Majeika story, which owed something to his experience of Parkinson's disease, and a history of the publisher John Murray, which was once again an account of what he loved best: the world of creative, turbulent literary and artistic co-operation.<br>
