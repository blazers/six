<span class="headword">Falkus,  Hugh Edward Lance</span>  (1917&#150;1996), <span class="occ">angler and naturalist</span>, was born on 15 May 1917 at Melton, Cornwall Road, Cheam, Surrey, during a zeppelin raid, the son of James Everest Falkus, bank clerk (shortly bank manager), and his wife, Alice Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Musgrove. His father retired from the City early and lived on a boat on the Essex marshes and then on another boat in Devon. Falkus, who was educated at the East Anglian School, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, caught his first fish when he was four, learned to shoot when he was six, and was an expert helmsman by the age of fifteen. By eighteen he had learned to fly and at twenty he became a pilot in the RAF. On 11 July 1939 he married Doris Marjorie (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of Harold Walter, garage proprietor. They had two sets of twins (three sons and a daughter). The youngest son died in infancy.<br>
<br>Falkus was a brilliant and headstrong pilot who had many brushes with death, partly because he insisted on performing aerobatics in all types of plane, including bombers. By 1941 he was flying Spitfires. He was scrambled to intercept enemy bombers, ran out of fuel, and crash landed in France. He was wearing only his pyjamas under his flying suit and the Germans took him for a spy. He narrowly avoided summary execution but for the intervention of an English-educated Wehrmacht major-general, who entertained him to champagne and cigars before he was sent on to prison camps in Poland and Germany. He made numerous attempts to escape, working on thirteen tunnels including the famous wooden horse tunnel. However, he refused to participate in the &#145;Great escape&#146; of March 1944, trying to dissuade others from doing so; fifty of those who escaped were caught and shot. Falkus finally broke out and reached England ten days before the war ended.<br>
<br>Falkus's years as a prisoner of war left deep scars. He resolved that &#145;no one else is going to give me another order, no one is going to shout at me again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). His first marriage had ended in 1947 and by the late 1940s he was making documentary films for cinema and television, including the acclaimed <span class="italic">Drake's Island</span> (1950). He also gave broadcasts for the BBC, where he developed friendships with Dylan Thomas, Louis MacNeice, and his second wife, Diana Jane Vaughan (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), editor of <span class="italic">Argosy</span> and daughter of Rowland Vaughan, schoolmaster. They married on 22 December 1950. Five months later, Falkus, with his wife and a crew, was shooting <span class="italic">Shark Island</span> (1952) off the west coast of Ireland when his boat hit a rock and went down. He and his boatman collected floating objects for his wife and crewmen to hold on to while they swam for help, but only Falkus survived. He went on to finish the film, which again was received with international acclaim, and donated the proceeds of it to the dependants of the lost crew. On 18 July 1952 he married Lady Margaret Frances Anne Muntz (1910&#150;1966), divorced wife of Frederick Alan Irving Muntz and second of four daughters of Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, seventh marquess of Londonderry. The marriage ended in divorce in 1958 and on 15 November that year Falkus (who was now living at Cragg Cottage, Ravenglass, Cumberland, under Ravenscrag in the Esk valley) married Kathleen Armstrong (<i>b</i>. 1931/2), daughter of Benjamin Armstrong, farmer, of Cragg Farm, Ravenglass. There were no children of the marriage, which was a happy one.<br>
<br>Falkus made several films for the BBC's natural history unit and narrated many programmes, including all forty episodes of Jacques Cousteau's <span class="italic">The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</span>. In the 1960s he collaborated with Niko Tinbergen, the Nobel prize-winning specialist in animal behaviour, on a series of outstanding wildlife films, including <span class="italic">Signals for Survival</span> (1969), which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971. <span class="italic">The Gull Watchers</span>, <span class="italic">The Sign Readers</span>, <span class="italic">The Beachcombers</span>, <span class="italic">The Riddle of the Rook</span> (shown at the Venice Film Festival in 1972), and <span class="italic">The Tender Trap</span> (awarded a certificate of merit by the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1975) followed. Two highly personal films, <span class="italic">Salmo the Leaper</span> (1977) and the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Portrait of a Happy Man</span> (1982) were highly successful. In 1982, Falkus was awarded the Cherry Kearton medal by the Royal Geographical Society for his wildlife work. He was also a highly successful author. He would write all night, aided by copious doses of whisky. <span class="italic">Nature Detective</span> (1978) was a highly regarded study of animal tracks and signs, and <span class="italic">The Stolen Years</span> (1965; 2nd edn, 1979)&#151;&#145;the best book I've written&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>)&#151;gave a vivid account of his early life.<br>
<br>Falkus will be best remembered, however, as one of the greatest writers and authorities the world has ever seen on salmon and sea trout fishing. He became fascinated by sea trout which, like salmon, spend part of their lives in rivers and part in the sea. Through years of dedicated study he concluded that sea trout fed mostly at night in the sea, and devised a series of strategies to trigger similar responses in rivers, though, for physiological reasons, they do not feed in fresh water. His book, <span class="italic">Sea Trout Fishing</span> (1962, 1975) revolutionized sea trout fishing. He also co-authored, with Fred Buller, <span class="italic">Fresh Water Fishing</span> (1975), a book of immense scholarship and charm, which has become the standard work on the subject and ran through nine editions by 1987. His <span class="italic">Salmon Fishing</span> (1984) was regarded from its publication as the authority on the subject. His <span class="italic">Speycasting: a New Technique</span> (1994) described an advanced method of casting for salmon, and was another best-seller.<br>
<br>Falkus was a restless and iconoclastic figure, with the stature and looks of a <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span> hero and a life to match. He could be intolerant and generous, egotistical and loyal, outspoken and compassionate. He could inspire fear in some, and complete devotion in others, touched by his deep kindness. Despite his share of tragedy, he insisted that his life had been predominantly happy. Through his lucid prose, dedicated research, and piscatorial wisdom he can be considered as one of the greatest angler&#150;writers of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In his final years Falkus suffered from cancer. He died of bronchopneumonia at Cragg Cottage on 30 March 1996. He was survived by his fourth wife, Kathleen, by two children from his first marriage&#151;Malcolm, professor of economic history in Australia, and a daughter who became a nun at Stanbrook Abbey. His oldest son Christopher, publisher, died in 1995.<br>
