<span class="headword">Lister,  Gulielma</span>  (1860&#150;1949), <span class="occ">mycologist and naturalist</span>, was born on 28 October 1860 at Sycamore House, 871 High Road, Leytonstone, Essex, one of seven children and the third of four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34552/', "Arthur Lister (1830&#150;1908)")</script>, a London wine merchant and naturalist, and his wife, Susanna, daughter of William Tindall of East Dulwich. The Listers were a Quaker family of distinction: one of Gulielma's uncles was the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34553/', "Lord Joseph Lister (1827&#150;1912)")</script>, and two of her brothers had outstanding careers in zoology and medicine respectively. Gulielma was educated at home except for a year spent at Bedford College for Women, about 1876, where she acquired a grounding in systematic and structural botany.<br>
<br>Long her father's companion and helper in his natural history studies, in the late 1880s Gulielma joined him in investigations of the Myxomycetes, or slime moulds, a group whose classification was then somewhat confused. Together they worked over collections in the British Museum (Natural History), Kew Gardens, the Paris Natural History Museum, and De Bary's collection at the University of Strasbourg, Gulielma making notes and drawings. The result of their labours was Arthur Lister's <span class="italic">Monograph of the Mycetozoa</span> (1894). A work of widespread interest, both in Britain and abroad, it brought a great influx of new material to the British Museum which in turn led to the recognition of new forms and extended knowledge of geographical distributions. After her father's death Gulielma brought out an expanded second edition (1911); a third, further enlarged and illustrated with coloured plates (an impressive collection of her own outstanding watercolours), followed in 1925. The latter remains a classic&#151;a key work on the taxonomy and nomenclature of the Myxomycetes.<br>
<br>The Listers' investigations, pursued without interruption over a period of sixty years, over the last forty by Gulielma Lister alone, were recorded in a remarkable collection of seventy-four research notebooks bequeathed to the British Mycological Society, and later deposited in the British Museum (Natural History). They contain a wealth of material, including the results of the Listers' early classification studies of historical collections, accounts of their own collections and research (which included some early life history studies), notes on materials submitted to them from collectors worldwide, and many fine watercolour illustrations. A long succession of their papers published in the botanical journals includes a number of reports on Myxomycetes from Switzerland where Gulielma Lister and her father especially enjoyed collecting, although Gulielma's real hunting-grounds were Epping Forest and the region around Lyme Regis. Of special interest was her 1912 presidential address to the British Mycological Society, &#145;Past students of the Mycetozoa and their work&#146;. Painstaking and accurate in her observations, free from bias and preconception, she kept abreast of studies by others in the field, even learning Polish to follow the work of Josef Rostafinsky. She was widely acknowledged as a world authority on the Myxomycetes.<br>
<br>Gulielma Lister's close association with the British Museum lasted from the late 1880s until 1939, when wartime conditions prevented her travelling to London. For many years she was virtually honorary curator of the Myxomycetes, a collection she had helped to make the most important and complete then in existence, and greatly enriched with her watercolours giving magnified views. At the museum she and her close friend lichenologist Annie Lorrain Smith were remembered particularly for their interest and understanding patience in teaching younger workers. A gentle, kindly, generous woman of attractive personality, she had a wide circle of friends and numerous correspondents in many countries (including the emperor of Japan, in whose honour she named a specimen from the palace gardens and whose gift of a pair of porcelain vases she greatly cherished).<br>
<br>A foundation member of the British Mycological Society, Gulielma Lister gave it considerable help in its early years; she was an influential council member and served twice as president (1912 and 1932). She became a member of the Essex Field Club in 1907, was its first woman president (1916), and thereafter a permanent vice-president. Long one of the club's leading spirits, participating regularly in its forays, she was especially active in the work of its Stratford museum, to which she donated both myxomycete and botanical collections. She was one of the first women fellows of the Linnean Society (elected 1904), served on the council (1915, 1927), and became a vice-president in 1929.<br>
<br>A distinguished naturalist with detailed field knowledge of both plants and animals, Gulielma Lister had particularly strong interests in birds and conifers. For many years she worked with quiet enthusiasm with the London School Nature Study Union, providing sound advice and for a time serving as chair. Her artistic skills often brought requests for help; she prepared the illustrations for both her cousin F. J. Hanbury's <span class="italic">Illustrated Monograph of British Hieracia</span> (1889) and Dallimore and Jackson's <span class="italic">Handbook of Coniferae</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Gulielma Lister died, unmarried, following a stroke, at her home, Sycamore House, 871 High Road, Leytonstone, Essex, on 18 May 1949. Her ashes were scattered over her mother's grave in Wanstead Friends' meeting-house burial-grounds.<br>
