<span class="headword">Beck,  Simon Adams</span>  (1803&#150;1883), <span class="occ">gas industrialist and lawyer</span>, was baptized at Condover, Shropshire, on 25 July 1803, the son of James Beck of Allesley Park, Warwickshire, and his wife, Sarah Coker. He trained as a lawyer and in 1829 married Sarah Ann, second daughter of Ralph Price (1780&#150;1860) of Sydenham. Beck was elected clerk and solicitor of the Ironmongers' Company in 1834, the same year that Price became master. Beck brought capable management skills to bear on the affairs of the company, dealing with its charitable work, watching over its property holdings, which were increasing greatly in value, and also dealing with the various commissions, boards, and departments interested in the affairs of the old London livery companies.<br>
<br>In 1848 Beck added to his duties those of a director of the Gas Light and Coke Company, which served parts of the cities of London and Westminster. It seems probable that Beck owed his election to the desire of the company to disarm criticism by appointing a respected City figure to the board; just as later, when parliament made difficulties with private bills put forward by Gas Light and Coke, two MPs were elected to the board. At that time gas companies were very unpopular. They were seen as exploiting their position by providing inadequate supplies of poor-quality gas at excessive prices and creating a nuisance with their gasworks. In 1848 the frustration of the corporation of the City of London was such that it considered seeking compulsory powers to municipalize gas supply. Beck was closely involved in negotiations with other London gas companies to present a common front in opposition to this threat. Rather than proceeding with municipalization, the corporation settled for encouraging the formation of a competing company, the Great Central, the effect of whose inauguration was to bring prices down from 7<i>s</i>. per 1000 cubic feet to 4<i>s</i>. within a few years.<br>
<br>Beck became deputy governor of the Gas Light and Coke Company in 1852 and governor in 1860. He gave considerable impetus to rationalizing both its commercial and its engineering activities. Its three small works, two in the City and a third at Westminster, were without access to cheap, water-borne coal supplies, and Beck inspired the drive to concentrate production on a riverside site at which colliers could unload directly. After considering various options, including that of the old Millbank prison (where the Tate Gallery was subsequently erected) the company settled on a 150 acre site owned by the Ironmongers' Company on the Thames at Barking, Essex. The huge new Beckton works, which began production there in 1870, not only resolved Gas Light and Coke's production difficulties, but also enabled the company to offer bulk supplies to other operations with similar problems.<br>
<br>The offer of a secure gas supply proved an irresistible lure when Gas Light and Coke offered full amalgamation to neighbouring companies. In 1869 the company provided only a seventh of London's gas, but this increased to two-thirds after a series of takeovers, including that of the Imperial company, which in 1869 was twice as large as Gas Light and Coke itself. The takeover of Imperial in 1876 provided the occasion for Beck's retirement. His leadership was sorely missed, however, as his successors mishandled a proposed amalgamation with the south London gas companies. These opted to merge instead with the South Metropolitan Gas Company, under the leadership of its formidable chief engineer, George Livesey. This engendered a rivalry between the two large London gas-producing companies that persisted until nationalization in 1949.<br>
<br>Beck had the reputation of being a benevolent and fair employer, but only among compliant workers. Following a strike in 1859 he refused to take back any union members. After another strike in 1872, the protest leaders were convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment; none of the strikers was re-employed. In organizational matters Beck achieved results through patient negotiation, and the short obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Journal of Gas Lighting</span> (6 March 1883) that described his governorship as &#145;a period of inaction&#146; was wide of the mark. His m&eacute;tier was that of a manager rather than an entrepreneur.<br>
<br>After his retirement from Gas Light and Coke Beck remained clerk to the Ironmongers' Company until shortly before his death on 26 February 1883, at Cheam in Surrey; this position passed to his son, Ralph Coker Adams Beck, and thereafter to two further generations of Becks. His wife survived him.<br>
