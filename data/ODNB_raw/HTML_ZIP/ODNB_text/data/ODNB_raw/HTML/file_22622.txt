<span class="headword">Potter,  Thomas Joseph</span>  (1828&#150;1873), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, born on 9 June 1828 at Scarborough, Yorkshire, was the son of George Potter and his wife, Amelia Hunt. His parents intended him to take orders in the Church of England, but, on 24 February 1847, he was received into the Roman Catholic church at Stockeld Park, Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, and joined Stonyhurst College. On 24 October 1854 he entered All Hallows' College, Dublin, and was ordained a priest on 28 June 1857. He was appointed professor of <i>belles-lettres</i> and sacred eloquence, and later director of All Hallows' College.<br>
<br>While on the staff of All Hallows', Potter began to contribute religious verses to <span class="italic">The Lamp</span> and other Catholic periodicals, and in 1860, his first novel, <span class="italic">The Two Victories</span>, appeared. It was followed a year later by <span class="italic">The Rector's Daughter, or, Love and Duty</span>, a didactic romance, and <span class="italic">Legends, Lyrics, and Hymns</span>, a collection of short stories and hymns, was published in 1862. The publication of two of Potter's collections of religious poetry, <span class="italic">Light and Shade</span> and <span class="italic">The Panegyrick of St Patrick</span>, followed in 1864. Potter's first real literary success, however, came with <span class="italic">Percy Grange, or, The Dream of Life</span>, published in 1865 with subsequent posthumous editions in 1876 and 1884. This success was followed by <span class="italic">Sir Humphrey's Trial, or, The Lesson of Life</span> (1870), a collection of poems and short stories based upon biblical and Irish legends which ran to four editions by 1884.<br>
<br>In 1868 Potter wrote a guidebook drawing upon his professional experience at All Hallows', <span class="italic">Sacred Eloquence, or, The Theory of Preaching</span>, which became a standard text for trainee priests and was reissued three times by 1870. He provided a companion volume in <span class="italic">The Spoken Word, or, The Art of Extempore Preaching</span> (1872). He died at All Hallows' on 31 August 1873. <span class="italic">Rupert Aubrey of Aubrey Chase</span>, a historical novel set in 1681, was published posthumously in Dublin in 1874, with a second edition in 1876. After his death, some of his poems were set to music and sung as hymns: in New York, in 1971, Virgil T. Ford published a musical score together with Potter's poetry, called <span class="italic">Jesus, Lord and Master</span>.<br>
