<span class="headword">Rainsford,  Charles</span>  (1728&#150;1809), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at West Ham, Essex, on 3 February 1728, was the second son of Francis Rainsford (<i>d</i>. 1770), an alderman of Maldon, Essex, and influential in its parliamentary elections, and his wife, Isabella, daughter of William Bale of Foston, Derbyshire. He was educated at Great Clacton, Essex, by a clerical friend of his father, and in March 1744 was appointed second cornet in General Bland's 3rd dragoons through the influence of his uncle, Charles Rainsford (<i>d</i>. 1778), deputy lieutenant of the Tower of London. The regiment was then serving in the War of the Austrian Succession, in Flanders against the French; Rainsford joined it at once, and carried the standard at the battle of Fontenoy on 30 April 1745. On 1 May he was appointed ensign in the Coldstream Guards, and with them was ordered home on the news of the Jacobite rising. In 1751 he was gazetted lieutenant with the rank of captain, and when James O'Hara, second Baron Tyrawley (1690&#150;1773), became colonel of the Coldstream Guards (April 1755), he made Rainsford successively adjutant to the battalion, major of brigade, and aide-de-camp. Rainsford was private secretary to Tyrawley, governor of Gibraltar (1756&#150;7); he returned in 1760, and in 1761 was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel, given a company, and sent to serve under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany.<br>
<br>In 1762, when Spain threatened to invade Portugal, Rainsford again accompanied Tyrawley thither as aide-de-camp, and was shortly afterwards appointed brigadier-general and chief engineer in Portugal; he fortified many strongholds there. He was ordered home in 1763, and promoted second major in the Grenadier Guards. From 1766 to 1780 he was equerry to William, duke of Gloucester, brother of George III, and became his confidant. He commanded the army detachment at the king's bench prison, Southwark, following the May 1768 riot, and wrote of &#145;the difficulties the military are subject to in cases of riot, when not supported by the civil authority&#146;  (Hayter, 33).<br>
<br>A professional soldier, Rainsford ranked his parliamentary involvement beneath his army career, and regarded the former as a means of advancing the latter. From December 1772 to 1774 he was, with Gloucester's permission, through the influence of William Nassau de Zuylestein, fourth earl of Rochford, and pending the election of Rochford's nephew and heir, a safe stopgap MP for the freeman franchise borough of Maldon, Essex. Bamber Gascoyne, the other Maldon MP, wrote in November 1773 that Rainsford was &#145;a creature of the Duke of Gloucester, no fortune&#146; and &#145;cannot be of consequence enough to hurt us when elected&#146;  (Namier, 346). Rainsford voted with the government and apparently did not speak in the house. A friend of the Percy family, he was through the influence of Algernon Percy, Lord Lovaine (brother of Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland), from February 1787 to December 1788 MP for the burgage borough of Bere Alston, Devon. He vacated the seat, presumably over the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>, on which Lovaine sided with the government, but Gloucester and Northumberland with the opposition. Northumberland recompensed him by returning him for Northumberland's burgage &#145;pocket borough&#146;, Newport, Cornwall, of which he was MP from 1790 to 1796. He followed his patron's line in voting for Grey's resolution on Ochakov (12 April 1791). In May 1796 he wrote that if parliament had been going to continue longer he would have &#145;begged leave to vacate my seat&#146;  (Thorne, 5.6), and he declined a seat in the next parliament. He took little part in parliamentary proceedings.<br>
<br>Promoted colonel in the army in August 1774, Rainsford was governor of Chester from 1776 to 1796. During 1776 and 1777 he was employed in raising troops in Germany for the American war, and in 1777 was appointed aide-de-camp to George III and in August promoted major-general. During the Gordon riots in June 1780 he commanded the camp established in Hyde Park and later at Blackheath. He provided cavalry escorts for infantry detachments sent from his Hyde Park camp, so that they could act in concert, while keeping a strong force to guard the camp with its supplies and six cannon. From May 1781 until his death he was colonel of the 44th regiment. In 1782 he was sent to take command of the garrison at Minorca, but before his arrival it surrendered to the Spaniards in February. He was promoted lieutenant-general in November 1782.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the revolutionary war in February 1793, Rainsford was sent as second in command to Gibraltar, where he commanded following the death of Sir Robert Boyd and remained until March 1795. He was promoted general in May 1796 and appointed governor of Cliff Fort, Tynemouth, in the same year; he saw no further active service. He married, first, on 18 July 1775 Elizabeth (1758&#150;1781), daughter of Edward Miles, and they had one son, Colonel William Henry Rainsford (<i>bap</i>. 1776, <i>d</i>. 1823), and two daughters, Julia Anne and Josephina; the latter, for whom Sir Joseph Yorke stood godfather, died in infancy. Rainsford married, second, on 16 February 1789 Ann Cornwallis (<i>d</i>. 1 Feb 1798), youngest daughter of Sir William More Molyneux of Loseley Park, Guildford; they had no children.<br>
<br>Rainsford had varied interests. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 13 May 1779; he was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a member of a society for making discoveries in Africa and of various benevolent institutions. He dabbled in alchemy, and was a Rosicrucian and a freemason. Rainsford died at his house, 29 Soho Square, London, on 24 May 1809. He was buried in a vault in the chancel of the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London, with his father, his uncle Charles, and his first wife.<br>
<br>Rainsford left nearly forty volumes of manuscript, which were purchased by the British Museum (BL, Add. MSS 23644&#150;23680) and are an important historical source. They include autobiographical memoranda, papers, and letters referring to Portugal, 1762&#150;4, to Gibraltar, 1793&#150;6, and to raising of German mercenaries, 1776&#150;8, a narrative of the expedition to the Mediterranean, 1781&#150;2, correspondence with Lord Amherst, the duke and duchess of Northumberland, and others, papers on freemasonry, magnetism, and alchemical processes, copies of the correspondence and papers of Lord Tyrawley, and Rainsford's journal of his travels with the duke of Gloucester. The papers on the raising of German mercenaries for the American War of Independence were printed in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the New York Historical Society</span> (1879).<br>
