<span class="headword">Figures, Sir  Colin Frederick</span>  (1925&#150;2006), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born at 34 Primrose Lane, Hall Green, Birmingham, on 1 July 1925, the son of Frederick Joseph Figures, insurance clerk, and his wife, Muriel Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hadwell. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham. He then served in the Worcestershire regiment from 1943 to 1948; his postings included the inter-service Russian language course at Cambridge and the British military missions in Romania and Hungary. On demobilization he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he took a degree in French and Russian. A keen sportsman, he had played rugby for King Edward's and for Pembroke College and had a chance of a Cambridge blue. Perhaps to console himself for not achieving this, towards the end of his time at university he co-founded the Woodpeckers, a combined Oxford and Cambridge touring rugby side. He was also an enthusiastic cricketer.<br>
<br>Figures joined the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, also known as MI6) directly from university in 1951. After two years at the head office in London he was attached to the Allied Control Commission in Germany from 1953 to 1956, then to the embassy in Amman from 1956 to 1958. After a year back in London, in 1959 he was appointed head of the important station in Warsaw, which gave him the chance to demonstrate his ability to recruit and run foreign spies under hostile conditions. His reputation within the service for competence and reliability was by this time growing into the realization that he was potentially a high-flying senior officer. In 1956 he had married a secretary at the Foreign Office, Pamela Ann (Pam) Timmis, with whom he had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Figures returned to London in 1962 and spent most of the next ten years dealing with operations behind the iron curtain, including a period from 1966 to 1969 as head of a station in a Vienna that would still have seemed atmospherically familiar to Harry Lime. This was a busy time politically as well as professionally, coinciding with the &#145;Prague spring&#146; of 1968, and led to his being appointed OBE in his last year there. Over the next ten years he broadened his relationship with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and, especially during four years directing SIS operations in Northern Ireland, with the Security Service (MI5) and the military. His east European experience proved extremely useful in the Irish context and during this period SIS shook off the adverse effects of the Philby and Blake disasters and scored a number of significant recruitment successes against the hardest east European targets. He was involved in the operational planning of several of these. By the time he handed over the Northern Ireland responsibility he had established himself as a leading member of the Whitehall intelligence community and was appointed CMG in 1978.<br>
<br>Figures was a natural choice to take over as deputy chief of SIS under Sir Arthur (Dickie) Franks in 1979, then to replace him as chief in 1981. Figures's four years as chief were conspicuously successful. He combined a background founded on solid midland middle-class values with practical common sense and an ability to lead by example. Self-effacing but quietly self-confident in manner, he exemplified SIS's stated policy of employing not risk seekers but risk takers. His door remained metaphorically, and often actually, open; and through it could sometimes be heard ball-by-ball test match commentary, turned down very low. He was approachable by the whole staff, a good delegator who was liked, respected, and trusted by his subordinates. A man of total integrity, he combined an infectious sense of humour with an absence of pomposity; never a puritan, he was always staunchly loyal to his family and he was unusually fortunate in having a wife who also established herself firmly in the affections of the service and took great interest in questions of welfare in what could sometimes be quite stressful professional circumstances.<br>
<br>Figures had not been long in the chair when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982. SIS initially came in for some criticism for not having forecast the invasion, as did the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but it was soon rightly accepted that foreign intelligence and diplomatic services faced an impossible task in monitoring the unpredictable policies of an erratic dictator. More importantly, and with some invaluable help from their excellent relationships with allied liaison services in North and South America, western Europe, and the Commonwealth, SIS was able to contribute significantly to the achievements of the armed forces in their successful military campaign. Among SIS's achievements was the monitoring of the commercial availability of Exocet missiles that might have replenished Argentinian stocks, the missiles having been deployed with considerable effect against the Royal Navy at a time when the outcome of the campaign was still far from clear. SIS was also able to complement Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in reporting on the Argentinian air force and navy. A less glamorous preoccupation for Figures as chief of SIS was the growing Treasury pressure to trim the budgets of the intelligence community and to improve the working relationships between SIS, the Security Service, and GCHQ. He was ideally suited for this role, lacking as he did any hint of pretentiousness or bombast but having a good eye for detail, and under his leadership SIS's relations with the other two services and with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were all harmonious. He was knighted KCMG in 1983.<br>
<br>During Figures's time as chief SIS was still unavowed, in other words the existence of the service was not officially acknowledged and still less was the identity of the CSS (chief of the secret service) himself known to the public. With increasingly open government, a press that rejected traditional attitudes towards secrecy, and not least because of the building of a relatively high-profile new headquarters beside the Thames to replace the nondescript building near Lambeth North tube station, it became impossible to maintain the pretence. The former low-profile existence had suited the inherently modest Figures very well, but it became much harder for him to avoid the limelight when in 1989 he was appointed intelligence co-ordinator in the cabinet office in succession to Sir Tony Duff. This job formalized the responsibility he had been given in SIS for budgetary control and joint intelligence co-operation, but now he had to oversee all three services and their relationships with Whitehall in general and with the joint intelligence committee, under Sir Percy Cradock, in particular. Rigorous financial controls were imposed by the Treasury, but making good use of his high reputation and popularity in the intelligence community Figures presided over four harmonious and successful years for British intelligence. One of his outstanding achievements in this period was the reorganization of the intelligence machinery in Northern Ireland, especially after the Ballygawley incident of August 1988, when eight British soldiers were killed and twenty-eight injured by an IRA bomb. His previous responsibility for SIS operations in the territory gave him an invaluable background for this task and meant that his views carried appropriate weight.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1989 Figures and his wife divided their time between Thames Ditton, Surrey, and the Isle of Wight. He even listed beachcombing as one of his pursuits, but he also keenly followed sport. During the last few years of his life he became increasingly incapacitated by Parkinson's disease and was fortunate to have a supportive wife and family. On 8 December 2006 he died peacefully after quite a long period in Emberbrook Care Centre, Thames Ditton. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
