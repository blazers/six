<span class="headword">Mellish,  William</span>  (1764&#150;1838), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born on 13 July 1764, the third son of <a name="cosubject_48028"></a><span class="headword">William Mellish</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1791), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, of Blyth, Nottinghamshire, and his second wife, Anne, the daughter of John Gore, a leading government financier.<br>
<br>Mellish's father was the second son of Joseph Mellish, landowner and politician, and his wife, Dorothy, the daughter of Sir William Gore, lord mayor of London. The elder William Mellish was educated at Eton College and at Peterhouse, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow. Originally intended for the bar, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1725 and to the Inner Temple in 1734. In the following year he married Catherine [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39731/', "Mellish, Catherine Rachel (1710&#150;1747)")</script>], the daughter of Joseph da Costa (1683&#150;1753) and the widow of Joseph Isaac Villareal of Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire. Both her father and first husband were wealthy Portuguese Jews. The couple had two sons. In 1762 Mellish married again; his new wife was Anne, daughter of John Gore, himself the son of Sir William Gore.<br>
<br>Keen to hold office, Mellish was appointed lord treasurer's remembrancer, a minor sinecure office in the exchequer, in 1753, and continued to hold this office until 1754. He was elected MP for East Retford in 1741, but gave up his seat in 1751 upon his appointment as a commissioner of excise. He became receiver-general of customs in 1760, but was dismissed in January 1763. He owed all his appointments to the patronage of the duke of Newcastle. An uninspired politician, Mellish's name appeared in Lord Egmont's list of 1749&#150;50 as one of &#145;the most obnoxious men of an inferior degree&#146;, and also as one of the twelve &#145;worst cast for us in the whole House&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>, 2.252). He succeeded to the Blyth estate in 1757 upon the death of his elder brother. He died on 16 December 1791.<br>
<br>The younger William Mellish and his elder brother John each inherited &pound;10,000 as well as the business of John Gore (including &pound;12,000 of capital stock in trade); in 1798 William secured sole control upon the death of his brother, murdered by highwaymen. There appears to have been in practice two firms, John Gore &amp; Co., and J. and W. Mellish &amp; Co., and in addition to being contractors in government loans, both firms seem to have been general mercantile houses, trading in cotton and copper to the Baltic, to Lisbon, and to Hamburg in 1807. William Mellish became a director of the Bank of England in 1792, and so continued until his death. He was deputy governor in 1812 for two years, then governor, again for two years. He became captain of the grenadier company of the Bank of England Volunteers in 1798, and major in 1805.<br>
<br>Mellish was elected MP for Grimsby in 1796, and again in 1803, ostensibly as a supporter of William Pitt. He was returned for Middlesex in 1806, and held this seat until defeated in 1820. He usually supported the ministries of the duke of Newcastle and the earl of Liverpool, and was always opposed to any measure of Roman Catholic relief. He spoke on several occasions in defence of the Bank of England, and voted in 1810 against parliamentary reform.<br>
<br>At the time of his death in 1838 Mellish, a wealthy man, owned a house in Bishopsgate, London, and a country estate at Bush Hill, Edmonton, which he had inherited from an aunt. This latter was a well-managed agricultural undertaking. Mellish died on 8 June 1838, at Bishopsgate, in his seventy-fifth year, and was buried in the church of All Saints, Edmonton. He does not appear to have married.<br>
