<span class="headword">Hildersham <span class="st"> [Hildersam]</span>,  Arthur</span>  (1563&#150;1632), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 6 October 1563 at Stetchworth, Cambridgeshire, near Newmarket, the son of Thomas Hildersam and his second wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22447/', "Sir Geoffrey Pole")</script> and niece of Cardinal Reginald Pole. His parents, who were both recusants, brought him up as a Roman Catholic and hoped that he would become a Catholic priest. His father sent Arthur to school at the grammar school at Saffron Walden, Essex, where the master, Desborough, &#145;a godly man, and a Religious Protestant&#146;, imbibed the young Hildersham with protestant principles. In 1576 he entered Christ's College, Cambridge, where like his fellow student William Perkins he almost certainly came under the influence of Laurence Chaderton, who was a proponent of the puritan wing of the church. After two years of study his father removed Hildersham to London, hoping that Catholic friends would help persuade him to go to Rome. When he declined to do so and remained unrepentant of a protestant conviction, it seems that he was disinherited. However, with the help of John Ireton, a fellow of Christ's and later rector of Kegworth, Leicestershire, Hildersham obtained assistance from his kinsman, Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, and was able to return to Christ's and complete his studies; he graduated BA in 1581 and proceeded MA in 1584. He apparently preached in the college chapel as part of the college exercise in divinity. In 1583 he was elected a fellow at Christ's, but the master, Barwell, together with Andrew Perne and William Goad, preferred another godly candidate, Andrew Willet. Following his protest to the chancellor of the university, Lord Burleigh, Hildersham was appointed divinity reader at Trinity Hall.<br>
<br>Hildersham's godly training and inclinations at Christ's placed him on the edge of conformity, and fitted him for a chequered ecclesiastical career. In trouble for preaching before his ordination and licensing, he had to recant on 10 January 1588, but he had been ordained by the time he took up a lectureship at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. On 5 January 1590 he married Anne Barfoot of Lamborn Hall, Essex, a county where he had kin. On the death of Thomas Wyddowes, vicar of St Helen's, Ashby, Huntingdon presented Hildersham to the living and he was instituted on 4 October 1593. His assize sermon at Leicester on 20 July 1596 on the text of <span class="roman">1 Kings</span> 18:17&#150;18 offended Judge Sir Edmund Anderson, who attempted to walk out and later threatened Hildersham with indictment by grand jury. In 1598 an attachment was sent out by the high court for his arrest, though nothing seems to have come of this. His standing as a leading godly divine is demonstrated by the fact that, with Stephen Egerton, Hildersham was one of the chief promoters of the 1603 millenary petition to James I, which requested further reforms in the liturgy, ceremonial, and structure of the church, although he was not a spokesperson at the Hampton Court conference. He distributed bequests to godly ministers, finding William Bradshaw and others employment, and supplying them with information.<br>
<br>But high esteem with prominent puritan clergy brought with it suspicion and opposition from those who sought no further reform of the church and desired complete obedience and conformity to its existing canons and liturgy. In 1605 William Chaderton, bishop of Lincoln, deprived Hildersham for nonconformity. However, William Overton, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, allowed him to preach at the godly exercises which were held at Burton upon Trent and Repton, and his family enjoyed continued support from Huntingdon, who paid an annual allowance to Hildersham's son Samuel, at least between 1606 and 1611. William Barlow, who succeeded Chaderton as bishop of Lincoln, restored Hildersham's licence to Ashby in January 1609. However, when Richard Neile became bishop of Coventry and Lichfield he suppressed the exercises at Burton and Repton and James I wrote to reprimand Barlow. By 1613 Hildersham had been incorrectly accused of encouraging the heretic Edward Wightman (Whiteman), and was again suspended. In 1615 he was imprisoned in the Fleet prison, and then the king's bench prison, for refusing the &#145;ex officio&#146; oath. Then he was accused of refusing to kneel for communion, and on 28 November 1616 was sentenced to imprisonment, to a fine of &pound;2000, and to be degraded from the ministry. He eluded capture, and managed to find refuge with friends of his patron. During this time he declined an invitation to the English church at Leiden. However, following James I's death, on 20 June 1625 he was licensed by Sir Thomas Ridley, the vicar-general of Canterbury, to preach in the dioceses of London, Lincoln, and Coventry and Lichfield, and he began preaching again at Ashby on 3 August on <span class="roman">Psalm 35:</span> 13. On 28 September 1625 he began a series of sermons preached over a number of years on <span class="roman">Psalm 51</span>. He was suspended again on March 25 1630 for failure to wear surplice and hood for public worship, but was restored again on 2 August 1631.<br>
<br>Hildersham was one of a number of high-profile godly ministers whose nonconformity was tolerated for periods of time, and then suddenly punished. He himself did not countenance separatism, though he encouraged meetings and gatherings for more intense and private spiritual exercises, and clearly disapproved of those clergy who were unable to preach. In his <span class="italic">CVIII Lectures upon the Fourth of John</span> (1629) he remarked that:<blockquote>it were as intolerable bondage and tyranny to binde Gods people to rest upon the ministry of such as can not instruct them, as it were to compell infants to abide with such nurses as have neither sucke nor food to give them.</blockquote>Like most of his godly churchmen, he advocated days of fasting and humiliation, arguing that the chief use of a religious fast is to humble, and afflict the soul with sorrow and grief, and a chief thing that makes prayer effectual with God is inward humiliation and sorrow of the soul. Many of Hildersham's sermons were preached at the communion service, and he also published <span class="italic">A Briefe Forme of Examination</span> (1619) and <span class="italic">The Doctine of Communicating Worthily in the Lord's Supper</span> (1619). His encouragement of regular communion was in contrast to the twice- or thrice-yearly practice common in most English parishes at this time. His understanding of sacraments was as &#145;mystical signs ordained by God, to represent and seal to the worthy receiver, salvation by Jesus Christ&#146;. Like many of his fellow divines he emphasized their importance as ordinances of God, but also feared that they might be seen as conferring grace in themselves. Much of his homiletic material was concerned with worthy preparation and instruction, which included knowledge of the law, the gospel, and the sacrament. He stressed too the need of assurance in salvation.<br>
<br>Hildersham preached his last sermon on 27 August 1631. He had had bouts of illness and fever in 1614 and 1615, and again in 1624. He contracted scorbutic fever, and died at Ashby on Sunday 4 March 1632. His will asked that there should be no funeral sermon, and he was buried in the chancel of Ashby church. An epitaph in the church gives recognition to one who was &#145;honourably descended from Sir Richard Poole&#146;, but more honoured for his sweet disposition, wisdom, charity, and &#145;judgment in the Holy Scriptures&#146; and his &#145;zealous preaching&#146;. He had several children; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13257/', "Samuel Hildersham (1594?&#150;1674)")</script>, by this time rector of West Felton, Shropshire, published his father's <span class="italic">CLII Lectures upon Psalme LI</span> in 1635.<br>
