<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Andrew</span>  (1794&#150;1861), <span class="occ">surgeon and naturalist</span>, was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 13 April 1794, the son of John Sinclair and Agnes Renfrew. Between 1814 and 1818 he studied medicine and surgery at the University of Glasgow, at L'h&ocirc;pital de la Charit&eacute; in Paris, and finally at the University of Edinburgh, from where he graduated MD in 1818. In 1822 he entered the navy as an assistant surgeon, and from 1823 to 1833 he served on the <i>Owen Glendower</i> off the Cape of Good Hope and in the Mediterranean. He also began to collect botanical and zoological specimens which he sent to the British Museum. Sinclair became a surgeon in 1829, and in 1834 was attached to HMS <i>Sulphur</i> on a surveying expedition to the South American coast, under the command of Captain Frederick William Beechey and afterwards of Sir Edward Belcher. Sinclair continued his interest in natural history, collecting plants in 1837 and 1838 in Mexico and Central America.<br>
<br>After a brief period in Britain to recover his health in 1839, Sinclair was appointed surgeon to a convict ship, and he had opportunities of collecting natural history specimens at several Australian ports. He spent some weeks in New Zealand in 1841 with Joseph Dalton Hooker, then naturalist to James Clark Ross's Antarctic expedition, and in 1843 he accompanied Captain Robert FitzRoy as private secretary, when FitzRoy became governor of New Zealand. On 6 January 1844 a somewhat reluctant Sinclair was made colonial secretary in New Zealand, and he served as such under a succession of governors and acting governors until the establishment of parliamentary government in May 1856. He was efficient rather than inspired in office.<br>
<br>In 1856 Sinclair retired to Britain on a pension, and he soon met some of the leading scientific figures of the day, having been elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1857. He returned to New Zealand in 1858 to collect in the middle and south islands material for a supplement to J. D. Hooker's <span class="italic">Flora</span>. He made arrangements with Sir John Francis Julius von Haast to explore Mount Cook, but was drowned on 26 March 1861 in endeavouring to cross on foot the River Rangitata, near Canterbury, New Zealand, when it was swollen by flood. He was buried in the nearby Mesopotamia station. Sinclair was unmarried. His zoological specimens, chiefly sponges and zoophytes, were mostly presented to the British Museum, and his plants went to Sir W. J. Hooker and were mainly described in Hooker and Arnott's <span class="italic">Botany of Beechey's Voyage</span> (1841), and in George Bentham's <span class="italic">Botany of the Voyage of HMS Sulphur</span> (1844). Sinclair himself published only two papers. He is commemorated in the names of sixteen New Zealand plants, as well as Mount Sinclair and Sinclair River.<br>
