<span class="headword">Clark, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1876&#150;1952), <span class="occ">civil servant and diplomatist</span>, was born on 1 January 1876 in Cambridge, the younger of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32420/', "John Willis Clark (1833&#150;1910)")</script>, superintendent of the Museum of Zoology and later registrar of Cambridge University, and his wife, Frances Matilda (1845&#150;1908), daughter of Sir Andrew Buchanan. Clark won a scholarship to Eton College and later to Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1897 he was awarded a BA, with first-class honours in the classical tripos. The next year he achieved a high position in the civil service entrance examinations and was appointed in 1899 as a clerk in the Board of Trade. There he soon acquired a reputation for incisiveness and efficiency. He was secretary to the special British mission which went to Shanghai to negotiate a commercial treaty with China in 1901&#150;2. During 1902 he was made acting second secretary in the diplomatic service, an even more unusual, if temporary, elevation in those days. In 1903 he was appointed CMG, a rare honour for so young a civil servant.<br>
<br>For the next two years, 1903&#150;5, Clark was secretary to the royal commission set up to consider the supply of food and raw materials in time of war and in light of the searing lessons of the recent South African War. From 1906 to 1908 he was private secretary to the president of the Board of Trade, Lloyd George, and for a brief time to his successor, Winston Churchill. Then Lloyd George, who had become chancellor of the exchequer, arranged for Clark's transfer to the Treasury to serve again as his private secretary. On 21 December 1909 Clark married Anne Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of William Thomas Monsell, and widow of William Bennett Pike, barrister. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Clark's next appointment, in 1910, as member for commerce and industry on the executive council of the viceroy of India, initially elicited some criticism, ostensibly because of his comparative youth and inexperience of India. Very soon, however, Clark was evidently capable in this job, and his skills and repute were acknowledged by his appointment as CSI in 1911 and KCSI in 1915.<br>
<br>In 1916 Clark returned to England and to the Board of Trade. He was made head of the commercial intelligence department with a brief to make recommendations to the wartime coalition government about how best to maximize channels of trade, still disrupted by war, and to help British exporters against increasing overseas competition. An outcome was the establishment in 1917 of a new department of overseas trade in Whitehall, of which Clark was made first head and comptroller-general from September 1917, a post he held with great distinction to 1928. This new department soon won wide acceptance among British exporters for the help it was giving them. Clark set up and personally oversaw a rigorous system for its selection of staff for headquarters and for many newly created posts overseas in Commonwealth and foreign countries. Among his many initiatives were the British Industries Fair, which became an annual event; British participation in important international exhibitions; and the occasional organization overseas of specifically British trade fairs. He began the systematic publication of economic and commercial reports about numerous overseas markets. His department was also largely responsible for organizing the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924&#150;5.<br>
<br>Clark was Britain's first high commissioner to be appointed to Canada, arriving in Ottawa in 1928. As well as his high reputation as an expert on trade he was acceptable to the Foreign Office, the Treasury, and in Whitehall generally, in a way that no Dominions Office appointee would have been. He made himself well known and respected in the small politico-diplomatic world of Ottawa, and with more difficulty, but purposefully, within the much scattered provincial populations across the wide expanse of Canada, when travel was still exclusively by train, bus, and car. He was a principal adviser to the unprecedentedly large high-level British delegation in Ottawa for what turned out to be the rather acrimonious Imperial Economic Conference of 1932. This long meeting launched the British Commonwealth on a complex system of tariff preferences at a time of world economic depression and imperial economic insufficiency.<br>
<br>One of Clark's first actions in Ottawa was to appoint the Board of Trade's senior trade commissioner in Canada as economic adviser on his staff, thereby enabling himself to keep closely in touch with Anglo-Canadian trade issues while avoiding a re-enactment on Canadian soil of some of Whitehall's inter-departmental battles. This precedent regarding the trade commissioner was soon followed by all other British high commissions. Clark was appointed KCMG in 1930 and stayed in Canada until 1934.<br>
<br>Clark was then appointed high commissioner in the Union of South Africa and simultaneously to the high commission territories of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland protectorate, and Swaziland, posts which he took up in January 1935. Clark navigated skilfully in the political shoals of J. B. M. Hertzog's prickly assertiveness and of J. C. Smuts's more mellow calculations, at a time when South Africa was experimenting tentatively with white man's coalition governments and when the <span class="roman">Status of the Union Act</span> of 1934 had altered substantially the <span class="roman">South Africa Act</span> of 1909, its founding statute. Clark had to handle a number of tricky issues involving South Africa and the high commission territories, the mandate over South-West Africa, its gold and other trade, immigration, and its government's suspiciousness about events elsewhere on the continent of Africa and in international affairs generally. It was a tribute to his skills and standing that in 1937 he was promoted to GCMG. Lord Garner, who knew Clark well from 1930 until his death, later wrote that he was the &#145;outstanding&#146; British high commissioner before the Second World War, and &#145;showed qualities of firmness and flexibility both in Canada and South Africa&#146;  (Garner, 46).<br>
<br>Clark returned to England in 1939 when he succeeded Sir Halford Mackinder as chairman of the imperial shipping committee. He retired from public service in 1940. In 1941 the council of the Royal Empire Society elected Clark as their chairman. Soon, however, the council released him from his duties, initially for four months, so that he could accede to a request by Lord Swinton to become head of the Lisbon branch of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. His prolonged absence from London impelled him in 1942 to write to the council of the Royal Empire Society resigning the chairmanship, though he continued to be actively interested in its proceedings for the rest of his life and was much in demand as a counsellor and speaker. In 1946 he accepted an invitation from the Dominions Office to visit its overseas posts and to make recommendations regarding future arrangements for the conduct of diplomacy in the British Commonwealth.<br>
<br>Over 6 feet tall, with bright blue eyes and a springy, athletic stride, Clark was affable and gregarious but dignified, with a quietly understated sense of humour. A close friend over many years aptly summed up his personal qualities in the following terms: &#145;he combined with an unfailing sense of humour and an old-world charm great tact, imperturbability and, in important issues, determination. These qualities and his patent integrity served him well throughout his public life&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Taking his public service as a whole, few, if any, did more to develop the diplomacy of the inter-war Commonwealth in practical terms. No single contemporary, certainly no civil servant, did more than he for his country's foreign trade in the inter-war years. He died in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1952, and was survived by his son and two daughters.<br>
