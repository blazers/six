<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander,  Horace Gundry</span>  (1889&#150;1989), <span class="occ">Quaker envoy and mediator</span>, was born on 18 April 1889 at Croydon, Surrey, the youngest of four sons of Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848&#150;1918), a Quaker barrister and advocate of international arbitration, and of Josephine Crosfield Alexander. He was educated at Bootham School in York and at King's College, Cambridge, where he gained first-class honours in history in 1912. After the outbreak of war in 1914 he served as secretary to a succession of anti-war committees. When conscription came in 1916 he was required, as a conscientious objector, to take up schoolteaching, working in Warwick and then in Cranbrook, Kent. On 30 July 1918 he married Olive Graham (1892&#150;1942), and the following year joined the staff of Woodbrooke, the Quaker college in Selly Oak, Birmingham, where he remained until 1944, teaching international relations, with a special emphasis on the League of Nations and associated institutions. He was apt to express impatience with what he felt to be the vague pietism of some Quaker peace witness, and based his own teaching firmly on practical activity.<br>
<br>Alexander's father had long worked for the suppression of the opium trade between India and China, and in 1927&#150;8 his son visited India and other parts of south-east Asia on behalf of the Selly Oak college to assess how controls on the trade worked. This visit convinced him of the need for Indian independence, a conviction confirmed by his first meeting with M. K. Gandhi in March 1928. In a later visit supported by the Quakers in 1930 he acted as an intermediary between Gandhi and the viceroy of India, Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax), helping to make possible Gandhi's participation in the round-table conference in London in 1931. After the conference Alexander, along with Agatha Harrison and Carl Heath, initiated the India Conciliation Group, which aimed to create a better understanding of Indian political aspirations.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1930s Alexander was preoccupied with the threatening situation in Europe. He was secretary of the Anglo-German Society, a group of politicians and journalists who, while keenly aware of Nazi barbarities, sought to change the situation by peaceful means. His efforts at conciliation continued up to and after the outbreak of war in 1939.<br>
<br>For many years Alexander's wife had been disabled by a paralysis confining her to a wheelchair, though she took an active part in the work of the college. In January 1942 she died, and later that year he returned to India with a section of the Friends Ambulance Unit, which undertook air-raid protection work in areas threatened by advancing Japanese forces. This enabled him to renew and extend his acquaintance with public figures in India, the more so since, with the onset of the great Bengal famine, relief work became the most pressing concern, raising urgent questions about the effectiveness of British administration. He was back in Britain in September 1943, advocating a relaxation of the stringent measures which had been the government's response to Gandhi's Quit India campaign.<br>
<br>In 1945 Alexander visited the United States, and was present in San Francisco as an accredited press representative for <span class="italic">The Friend</span> when the United Nations was established. Following the election of a Labour government in Britain, he and Agatha Harrison operated in the background of Indian pre-independence negotiations to help unofficially at difficult moments. He was much involved in efforts to control the violence between Muslims and Hindus that marred the transfer of power, and was with Gandhi in Calcutta when independence was declared on 15 August 1947. With his Friends Ambulance Unit colleague Richard Symonds he served as an observer monitoring the situation of refugees in the partitioned province of the Punjab, and in subsequent years undertook a number of similar tasks. His personal dignity and immense patience admirably qualified him for such work. After 1951 he was based mainly in England again, and for many years in books and articles interpreted Gandhian ideas, and especially Indian policies in world affairs, to a Western audience. In 1984 his services were rather belatedly recognized with the award of India's Padma Bhushan medal.<br>
<br>Alexander had a lifelong passion for bird-watching. He and his elder brothers Wilfrid and Christopher belonged to the group of pioneers who substituted observation of the living bird for the collection of museum specimens. They are among the founding fathers of bird-watching, now the hobby of thousands. They also set those high standards of field identification, by both ear and eye, which have enabled the amateur bird-watcher to make an important contribution to the science of ornithology. Alexander's own contribution was recognized by the British Ornithologists' Union, whose records committee he chaired from 1957 to 1969. In 1958 he had married his second wife, Rebecca Bradbeer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Biddle (1901&#150;1991), and in 1969 went to live in Pennsylvania, where he died, at a retirement home in Crosslands, on 30 September 1989.<br>
