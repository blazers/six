<span class="headword">Marisco,  Geoffrey  de</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1171, <em>d.</em> 1245), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland</span>, was a member of a Somerset family which in that county held one of the manors of Huntspill and the manor of Cloud. He was born shortly before 1171. His mother was a sister of John Cumin (or Comyn), archbishop of Dublin; in 1220 she was said to be on the point of death. Marisco's elder brother, William, was granted Lundy island, which had previously belonged to the knights templar, by Richard I in 1194. William was a naval administrator in King John's service but supported the rebels in the civil war of 1215&#150;17; he is last mentioned in 1229&#150;30. His son Jordan who received land in Ireland through his uncle, Geoffrey, was dead by October 1234.<br>
<br>Geoffrey de Marisco is first mentioned in 1192 in an <i>inspeximus</i> (a charter confirming earlier grants) made to him by his uncle, John Cumin, of Holywood, Wicklow, which his brother Walter had previously held. His other lands in Ireland included a manor at Knockainy in Limerick, near which, at Any (now Hospital), he founded a preceptory for knights of St John before 1215. In 1226 he was granted a fair at this manor, and also at Adare on the Maigue, which belonged to him from an early stage. After his outlawry in 1238 both manors escheated to the crown. Knockainy was for some time retained by the king, but Adare soon passed to the Fitzgeralds of Offaly. He also held Killorglin in Kerry.<br>
<br>In 1200 Marisco was with the king at Ledbury, Gloucestershire, and received a grant of &#145;Katherain&#146; (probably Knockainy) in exchange for other lands in Ireland, together with 20 marks, to fortify a house there for himself. In 1208 he defended William (I) Marshal's position in Leinster against King John's machinations and defeated the justiciar, Meiler fitz Henry, at Thurles, Tipperary. He was pardoned for this and in 1210 accompanied King John in his campaign in Ireland against Hugh de Lacy. In the same year he led an expedition into Connacht with Thomas fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1213/14) and the English of Munster supported by &Oacute; Briain. In 1212 he joined the other English magnates in Ireland in protesting his loyalty to John in the face of Pope Innocent III's threat to absolve the king's subjects from their allegiance. In 1213 Marisco, who was possibly <i>custos</i> (deputy justiciar) at the time, was defeated with the English of Meath at Fircall, Offaly, by Cormac &Oacute; Maoil Sechlainn. In the summer of 1215 he was with the king at Marlborough and on 6 July was appointed justiciar of Ireland, giving two of his sons as pledges for his behaviour. He built a castle at Killaloe, Clare, in 1217 and forced the people to accept an English bishop, Robert Travers, who was also his nephew.<br>
<br>In 1218 Marisco was ordered to raise money to enable the king to pay Louis, the son of the French king, the sum promised to him, and to pay the papal tribute. He was ordered in 1219 to pay the revenues of the crown into the exchequer at Dublin, and to present himself before the king, leaving Ireland in the care of Henry of London, archbishop of Dublin. Having already taken the cross he received a safe conduct to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and travelled to England. There in March 1220 he entered into an agreement with the king at Oxford, in the presence of the council, with reference to the discharge of his office, pledging himself to pay the royal revenues into the exchequer, and to appoint faithful constables for the king's castles, and delivering one of his sons to be kept as a hostage by the king. On his return to Ireland he was commanded to resume the demesne lands that he had alienated without warrant. Complaints were made against him to the king by the citizens of Dublin, and in July 1221 the king wrote to the council in Ireland, declaring that he had received no money from that country since he came to the throne and that Marisco, who had while in England made a fine with him to satisfy defaults, had not obeyed his wishes. Henry therefore desired that he should give up his office. Marisco resigned the justiciarship on 4 October, was thanked for his faithful services, quitclaimed of 1080 marks, part of the fine made with the king, and received a letter of protection during the king's minority, and the wardship of the heir of John of Clahull. Marisco had given some crown escheats to his friends and ignored some royal mandates. The cantred of Ossures, Kerry, for instance, was given to his son Robert. These Kerry dealings cost him his job in 1221.<br>
<br>In 1224 Marisco, who had been holding a parley with &Aacute;ed &Oacute; Conchobhair, joined the justiciar William (II) Marshal and Walter de Lacy in besieging Trim, which was defended by supporters of the rebellious Hugh de Lacy. In November and December of the same year he acted as <i>custos</i> in the Marshal's absence and carried on war with &Aacute;ed &Oacute; N&eacute;ill in support of &Aacute;ed &Oacute; Conchobhair , the son of Cathal, who had been ousted from the kingship of Connacht. On 25 June 1226 he was reappointed justiciar and being then in England received on 4 July a grant of &pound;580 a year, to be paid out of the Irish exchequer as salary. English policy towards Connacht had changed with the revival of de Burgh fortunes and Marisco attempted to capture &Aacute;ed &Oacute; Conchobhair. This action was resented by many of the English lords in Ireland and Marisco wrote to the king to complain in particular of Theobald Walter, his own son-in-law, who, he claimed, had garrisoned Dublin Castle against the king. &Aacute;ed &Oacute; Conchobhair captured Marisco's son, William, near Athlone and returned him in exchange for his own son and daughter, who were being kept hostage by the English. &Aacute;ed was killed in the following year in Marisco's house, although whether or not with the justiciar's connivance is not clear. At this time Marisco also built castles at Rindown and Ballyleague, Roscommon, on the Shannon. In his energetic attempts to dispossess the Irish he set the tone for his successors during Henry III's reign. He resigned the justiciarship in February 1228 and with Walter de Lacy and the justiciar Richard de Burgh inflicted a severe defeat on the Irish of Connacht.<br>
<br>Marisco was with Richard Marshal on the Curragh on 1 April 1234 when the latter was fatally wounded by a group of magnates possibly acting on Henry III's behalf. Marisco was suspected of betraying Marshal but this is unlikely. Both he and his son William were gaoled until September 1234 and were each fined &pound;2000. In the spring of the following year, 1235, Henry Clement, a messenger of the Irish justiciar, Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1257), was murdered in Westminster, almost certainly by a party led by William de Marisco and probably in revenge for the slaying of Marshal. After the murder Geoffrey de Marisco fled to the hospital of St John in Clerkenwell. He was allowed to leave on 9 June 1235 and in November of that year one of those imprisoned after the murder, Walter Comyn, who had lands in Offaly and who was probably a kinsman of Marisco, was delivered to him, having found pledges. Marisco's lands were restored to him on 3 August 1235. In the same year, however, he was excommunicated by Hubert de Burgh, brother of Richard and bishop of Limerick, for keeping Kilmallock from the see. Marisco had enfeoffed his son William of Kilmallock and Hubert de Burgh had unlawfully taken it as an escheat because William had fled to Lundy island after Clement's death and had been outlawed.<br>
<br>In 1238 an attempt was made to assassinate Henry III and suspicion fell on William and Geoffrey de Marisco. Geoffrey was also in trouble because he had not paid the instalments of his fine, and, as he had no lands in England, the Irish justiciar was ordered to distrain his lands there. Some time between then and 1242 he fled to Scotland where he was sheltered by Walter Comyn. In 1244 he was forced to leave Scotland, possibly as part of the agreement reached in that year between Henry III and Alexander II. He died in France in the following year.<br>
<br>Geoffrey de Marisco married three times. The name of his first wife is not known. William de Marisco was a child of this marriage. In 1224 William was taken into king's service as a member of the household. Some time before then he married Matilda, niece of Henry, archbishop of Dublin, whose marriage portion included the castle of Coonagh. Following the murder of Clement he travelled to Lundy island which was evacuated by William, son of Jordan de Marisco. Jordan was Geoffrey de Marisco's first cousin, and both Jordan and his son William held land in Ireland. This William had been on the Curragh with his great-uncle Geoffrey and recovered his Irish land only in 1237. William son of Geoffrey held out in Lundy island until 1242 and used it as a base for piratical attacks on shipping between England and Ireland, sometimes in collaboration with the Scottish crown. In June 1242 he was captured and was executed at the Tower of London on 25 July 1245. His wife, Matilda, was kept at Gloucester until 1243 and succeeded in 1247 in recovering her marriage portion from the archbishop of Dublin. The other children of Geoffrey de Marisco's first marriage included Walter and Thomas and possibly John, who married Mabel, the daughter of Hamo de Valognes and a granddaughter of Richard de Burgh. One daughter, possibly called Joan, married Theobald Walter, while a second, whose name is not known, married Hugh Tyrel.<br>
<br>Marisco's second wife was Eva, the daughter and heir of Robert of Bermingham, to whom Richard fitz Gilbert, earl of Pembroke (Strongbow), had granted Offaly. She had married first, in 1193, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9552/', "Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald")</script>, who died in 1204. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9576/', "Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1257)")</script>, came of age in 1215, but did not retrieve Offaly from Marisco until the latter's disgrace in 1234. Eva married second Geoffrey fitz Robert, seneschal of Leinster, who was dead by 1211. She married Marisco between that date and 1217 and died before 1226. Their son Robert, who in 1240 was called the brother of Maurice Fitzgerald, joined his outlaw brother William de Marisco on Lundy island and was dead by 1240. Marisco's third wife was Alice, the widow of Roger Pipard and sister of Walter and Hugh de Lacy. This marriage had taken place by 1232.<br>
