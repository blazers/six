<span class="headword">Sutherland,  (Carol) Humphrey Vivian</span>  (1908&#150;1986), <span class="occ">classical scholar and numismatist</span>, was born on 5 May 1908 at Merton Park in Surrey, the second of the three children of George Humphrey Vivian Sutherland (1873&#150;1952) and his wife, Elsie (1877&#150;1957), daughter of James Foster. He was known by his second name, Humphrey. His father spent his career in the Board of Education; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31737/', "Graham Sutherland")</script>, the distinguished painter, was his elder brother.<br>
<br>Humphrey Sutherland was educated at Homefield preparatory school, Sutton, Surrey, and at Westminster School, where he was a king's scholar and, in his final year, captain of the school. A Westminster scholarship took him to Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a first in moderations, in 1929, and a second in Greats, in 1931. He worked briefly at the Hellenic Society's library in London before returning to Oxford in 1932, at the invitation of J. G. Milne, to work as a part-time assistant keeper in the newly founded Heberden coin room, in the Ashmolean Museum, at a salary of &pound;200 a year. He began a lifetime's work in numismatics with no previous knowledge of coins.<br>
<br>In 1933 Sutherland married Monica Porter (<i>d</i>. 1982), a widow with three young children, and the family soon moved to Westfield House, Cumnor, where Humphrey and Monica Sutherland were to remain to the end of their lives; the garden there, and classical music, were Sutherland's particular delights. At work he quickly developed an expertise in Roman numismatics and won the Barclay Head prize for ancient numismatics in 1934; he published <span class="italic">Romano-British Imitations of Bronze Coins of Claudius I</span> in 1935 and <span class="italic">Coinage and Currency in Roman Britain</span> in 1937. During the Second World War he served with the fire service and took on additional teaching duties within the university and at St Edward's School, in Oxford, but his work at the Ashmolean continued. His swift response to the auction of Lord Grantley's collection secured, in 1944, the Crondall hoard of early Anglo-Saxon gold coins. Although the jewellery associated with this hoard had disappeared all the coins were acquired and these provided the basis for Sutherland's 1948 publication, <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Gold Coinage in the Light of the Crondall Hoard</span>, which remains an essential source on this topic. It was characteristic of the breadth of Sutherland's vision that he should have recognized the importance of such material outside his own specialization and moved so energetically to acquire it.<br>
<br>After the war Sutherland was elected a student of Christ Church and was appointed to a permanent and full-time assistant keepership at the Ashmolean. He also served as a university lecturer in numismatics from 1939 until his retirement and, in his college, as curator of pictures from 1947 to 1955 and from 1970 to 1975. He had a fine, aesthetic eye and a well-developed sense of style, which he employed to good advantage both in the coin room and in the Christ Church picture gallery. He also took care to ensure that his own appearance was never less than spruce, even dapper, which, combined with his polished and courteous manner and rather dashing Jaguar car, enabled him to cut a figure of considerable panache. Despite the minutely detailed and exacting standards of his scholarship Sutherland never allowed numismatics to seem dull. This may account for the great influence of his teaching; many of his pupils went on to museum and university posts with a greatly enhanced understanding of the importance of coins for the study of history.<br>
<br>Sutherland's assured and urbane style may also explain how he managed to carve out a growing share of the university's resources for the Heberden coin room. As an adjunct to the department of antiquities the coin room was staffed, in the 1930s, by &#145;a man and a boy&#146;, as Sutherland used to say. By the time of his appointment as keeper, in 1957, the coin room had achieved the status of an independent department in its own right, and when he retired, in 1975, the establishment consisted of five full-time academics, a part-time assistant, and two secretaries. The original coin room had expanded through the addition of a library, a teaching room, and a suite of offices.<br>
<br>If Sutherland's greatest work was the creation of a thriving department which was securely enough established to continue to flourish after his departure his scholarly publications also constituted an enduring legacy. In addition to hundreds of articles and reviews he published a number of longer works, including two volumes of the important <span class="roman">Roman Imperial Coinage</span> series: volume 1, <span class="italic">31 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>&#150;<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69</span> (1986), and volume 6, <span class="italic">From Diocletian's Reform (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 294) to the Death of Maximinus (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 313)</span> (1967). He also helped to edit this series and the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span> as well as serving as president of the Royal Numismatic Society (1948&#150;1953), of the International Numismatic Commission (1960&#150;73), and as <i>consiglio</i> of the Centro Internazionale di Studi Numismatici in Naples (1966&#150;73). He was honoured by all the leading European and American numismatic societies and in 1970 was created a CBE and elected a fellow of the British Academy. Sutherland died at his home, Westfield House, Cumnor, Oxford, on 14 May 1986, working to the end on the proofs of his <span class="italic">Roman History and Coinage, 44 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>&#150;<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69</span>.<br>
