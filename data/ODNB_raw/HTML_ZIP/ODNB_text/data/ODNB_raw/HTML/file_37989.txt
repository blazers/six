<span class="headword">Snell,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1667, <em>d.</em> 1733), <span class="occ">writing-master</span>, was born in London and was baptized on 27 February 1667 at St Giles Cripplegate, the son of Berry Snell (<i>d</i>. in or before 1675), vintner, and his wife, Winifred. In 1675 he was admitted to Christ's Hospital from St Giles Cripplegate; he left the school in 1681 to be apprenticed to the writing-master William Brooks, in the City of London. Here he made his own career as a writing-master; he also published books on bookkeeping and was occasionally employed as an auditor. With his wife, Susannah, he had a son, Charles, who was baptized on 20 October 1698 at Christ Church, Greyfriars, and who predeceased his father.<br>
<br>Snell became a bright star in a contemporary galaxy of writing-masters. In 1694 he published his first copybook, <span class="italic">The Pen-Man's Treasury Open'd</span>. This contained his first critical attack, following the current practice of vituperation between writing-masters, on the over-elaborate style of &#145;his brother Quills&#146;. He claimed to have avoided &#145;the Starch'd affected Flourishes, and illiterate copies that senseless Pretenders have imposed on the world &hellip; Such Empericks, by their barbarous Copies, both Written and Printed, have led youth into a Labyrinth of Errors&#146;  (Heal, 104).<br>
<br>In 1700 Snell succeeded John Seddon as master of the Sir John Johnson's Free Writing School, where he remained until his death thirty-three years later. The year 1712 saw his second copybook, <span class="italic">The Art of Writing in its Theory and Practice</span>, with a similarly critical preface. In 1715 he published his own writing rules, rigid and meticulous in form, entitled <span class="italic">The Standard Rules of the Round and Round-Text Hands</span>. This book became the focus of a notable quarrel with another distinguished writing-master, John Clark, which, with criticisms and counter-criticisms, lasted for several years, incidentally increasing Snell's copybook sales. In 1711 he produced handwriting plates included in <span class="italic">Penmanship in its Utmost Beauty and Extent</span> (1731), by George Bickham.<br>
<br>Snell has been criticized for causing a decline in handwriting by promoting his dull copperplate style, but his practice and teaching of a simpler and standardized mode of handwriting most effectively met the needs of clerks in the growing number of commercial houses. That is his principal claim to fame. He died at his London home in Sermon Lane in 1733, survived by his wife.<br>
