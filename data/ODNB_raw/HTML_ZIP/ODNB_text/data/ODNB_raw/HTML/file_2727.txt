<span class="headword">Blythe,  Geoffrey</span>  (1496/7&#150;1542), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Blythe of Barnby, Yorkshire, where he was born. He was probably the nephew of Geoffrey Blythe, bishop of Lichfield, and of John Blythe, bishop of Salisbury; presumably it was the former who arranged for his younger namesake to be educated at Eton College, having himself been a schoolboy there. A king's scholar at Eton, in 1515 the younger Geoffrey Blythe, now aged eighteen, was elected to King's College, Cambridge, where he was a fellow between 1518 and 1524, and where he graduated BA in 1520 and proceeded MA in 1523. Between these degrees he was collated successively to the prebends in Lichfield Cathedral of Pipa Minor (1520) and Tervin (1521). He also went to Louvain, travelling in 1521 with Nicholas Daryngton (later prebendary of Lichfield and diocesan visitor), who noted that Blythe was seriously ill at the time, and matriculating at the university there on 6 December 1522. In 1528 he was appointed warden of the King's Hall, Cambridge, as both his likely uncles had been before him, and was vicar of Chesterton from then until 1534. In 1529 he was admitted to the degree of DCL at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Probably in 1529 Blythe became archdeacon of Stafford, but resigned following his collation to the treasurership of Lichfield on 6 June 1530. It may have been in 1529 that he was one of the &#145;swarme&#146; of divines recorded by Foxe as &#145;preachyng &hellip; and barking&#146; at Cambridge against Hugh Latimer  (Foxe, 2.1735). In 1541 he resigned his wardenship of the King's Hall, and he died in the following year, presumably in Cambridge, being buried in All Saints' Church there on 8 March 1542.<br>
