<span class="headword">Thouless,  Robert Henry</span>  (1894&#150;1984), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, the son of Henry James Thouless, an iron-founder's clerk, and his wife, Bell Maud Bird (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Harper) was born at 48 Grove Avenue, Lakenham, Norwich, on 15 July 1894. He attended the City of Norwich School before moving to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1912, gaining a BA in natural sciences in 1915. After war service as brigade signal officer in the British Salonica forces he obtained an MA in 1921, was elected to a fellowship of Corpus Christi the same year, and obtained his PhD (Cambridge) under C. S. Myers in 1922. As lecturer in psychology, he subsequently helped to establish psychology at the universities of Manchester (1921&#150;6) and Glasgow (1926&#150;38), before joining the education department, Cambridge, as reader in educational psychology (emeritus reader after his retirement in 1961), becoming a much loved Cambridge figure. In 1923 he married Priscilla Gorton (author of <span class="italic">Modern Poetic Drama</span>, 1934); they had a son and a daughter. He was re-elected fellow (non-resident) of Corpus Christi College in 1945 (his earlier fellowship had lapsed in 1924). Actively involved in the British Psychological Society (serving as president in 1949) and in intra-disciplinary affairs throughout his long career, Thouless played an invaluable role in establishing psychology as an academic discipline and a profession in Britain.<br>
<br>Thouless's most long-standing interest was in the relationship between psychology and religion; he turned his PhD thesis into the first British textbook on the topic, <span class="italic">Introduction to the Psychology of Religion</span> (1923, 3rd edn 1961). A monograph on the medieval mystic Julian of Norwich (<span class="italic">The Lady Julian</span>, 1924), academic papers (including the 1954 Hulsean lectures, published as <span class="italic">Authority and Freedom: some Psychological Problems of Religious Belief</span>, 1954), and several popular works followed. Devoutly Christian, he strove to allay fears of psychology among fellow believers and to identify links between the new psychotherapies and Christian approaches to the cure of souls. Associated with this was an intense involvement in psychical research, on which he published <span class="italic">Experimental Psychical Research</span> (1963), and over ninety articles, as well as being president of the Society for Psychical Research (1942&#150;5). He left two, as yet uncracked, ciphered messages for posthumous decoding via a medium.<br>
<br>Thouless's reputation within the discipline rested on more orthodox work, notably his highly successful textbook <span class="italic">Social Psychology</span> (1925), the first such British work to address social psychology. On occasion he linked the religious and social psychological strands (for example, in his Riddell memorial lectures, 1940). Thouless was one of the few British psychologists of his generation to specialize in social psychology (then expanding rapidly in the USA). His approach was initially largely non-experimental, ignoring the quantitative research on attitudes and their measurement which, by 1937, was dominating the sub-discipline in the United States, but later editions of <span class="italic">Social Psychology</span> laid increasing stress on statistical procedures, on which he also published specialist articles. His experimental research concentrated on psycho-galvanic skin response changes in relation to emotion, and perception, including the discovery in 1931 of &#145;phenomenal regression to the real object&#146; in which, for example, obliquely viewed discs appear less elliptical than they should. A claim by Thouless made in 1933 for a racial difference in the extent of this was subsequently rejected. Thouless's major educational work was <span class="italic">A Map of Educational Research</span> (1969). Lay readers knew him best for his popular <span class="italic">Straight and Crooked Thinking</span> (1930) and its sequel, <span class="italic">Straight and Crooked Thinking in War Time</span> (1942).<br>
<br>The range of Thouless's work, his contribution to the discipline's institutional development in Britain, and popularization of its findings render him a major figure, while his efforts towards reconciling psychology and religion countered the image of psychology as intrinsically anti-Christian. He was, however, an eclectic rather than an original theorist. Thouless died at his home, 2 Leys Road, Cambridge, on 25 September 1984.<br>
