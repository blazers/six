<span class="headword">Barton, Sir  Sidney</span>  (1876&#150;1946), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at Devonshire Place, Union Road, Exeter, on 26 November 1876, the youngest son in a family of four sons and four daughters of James Barton (1834&#150;1919), captain in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Mary Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1929), youngest of four daughters of Sir David William Barclay, tenth baronet, of Pierston, Ayrshire, and his first wife, Lise Josephe de Rune, youngest daughter of Charles Malo de Rune, of Mauritius. James Barton had resigned his army commission on becoming a member of the Plymouth Brethren during the wave of religious feeling that swept Britain after the Crimean War and from him Barton inherited the religious feeling that dominated his life.<br>
<br>Barton was a foundation scholar of St Paul's School but there was no question of his proceeding to higher education since his father, who had &#145;peculiar views on education &hellip; objected to universities&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Jan 1946). Instead, in September 1895, Barton went straight from school to Peking (Beijing) as a student interpreter in the consular service. The Boxer uprising found him absent on special service at Weihaiwei, but he contrived, as ever, to reach the centre of things by joining as interpreter and then assistant political officer the China field force which stormed Tientsin (Tianjin) and subsequently took part in the relief of the legations. For his services he was awarded the China medal with clasp and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Barton passed with distinction through the various grades in the consular service and in November 1910 was called to the bar by the Middle Temple. In May the following year he was promoted to the responsible post of Chinese secretary in Peking and in March 1922 he became consul-general in Shanghai, a post which at that time came next to New York in importance. He was able to render most valuable services to British interests which he defended to the limits of his great vitality and nervous energy. This naturally made him very popular with the British community, while he was respected but cordially disliked by the Chinese officials with whom he had to deal. Although temperamentally inclined to forceful measures he was by no means a &#145;gunboat consul&#146;. In a period when central government, indeed any government at all, had broken down, strong measures were frequently deemed necessary to protect British interests. Barton was never afraid to advocate such measures or to take them on his own responsibility, but he was careful not to overstep the line between the defensive and the aggressive. His qualities of strength, resourcefulness, courage, and good temper under strain were exactly right in the circumstances of the time and he played a leading part in keeping alive British trade and influence through long years of storms.<br>
<br>In May 1929 Barton was promoted to the diplomatic rank of British minister in Addis Ababa. His methods were characteristically blunt and he proved himself, as in China, to be quite fearless and at his best in dangerous situations. He won the confidence of the emperor to an exceptional degree and was making a great success of his post when Italy invaded Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935. He was horrified and deeply upset that the League of Nations and Britain in particular did not take a tougher line to prevent &#145;an international crime&#146;  (telegram, 18 Feb 1935, TNA: PRO, FO 371/20166 J643/1/1). He also spoke forcefully of Italy's &#145;criminal frightfulness&#146; in using mustard gas and inflicting &#145;appalling&#146; suffering on the Ethiopian people  (telegram, 20 March 1936, TNA: PRO, FO 371/20166 J2458/45/1). Meanwhile, with his usual energy he organized security for British and foreign nationals and made ready to receive refugees at the British legation. According to a contemporary source, Barton was distressed by the &#145;thinly disguised portrait&#146; Evelyn Waugh had drawn of him and his daughter Esme in <span class="italic">Black Mischief</span> (written after Waugh attended the emperor's coronation in 1930  (W. F. Deedes, <span class="italic">Dear Bill: W. F. Deedes Reports</span>, 1998, 32). He returned to England after Italy captured Addis Ababa in May 1936 and he retired in May 1937. He maintained his keen interest in Abyssinian affairs and was partly instrumental in securing the secret return of the emperor to his capital.<br>
<br>Barton was appointed CMG in 1913, KBE in 1926, KCVO in 1931, and GBE in 1936. On 23 July 1904 he married Mary Ethel Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1945), eldest daughter of Alexander Palmer MacEwen, a director of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. She shared her husband's ideals and vigorously pursued complementary activities which were rewarded with appointment as an OBE in 1928 and, in 1937, a CBE (for welfare work in Addis Ababa). They had two sons and two daughters, one of whom married, in 1933, Baron Filippo Muzi Falconi, Italian minister at Sofia. His wife died in April 1945 and on 20 January 1946 Barton died of cancer of the lung and larynx, at his home, 19 Neville Street, South Kensington, London. He was survived by one son and two daughters.<br>
