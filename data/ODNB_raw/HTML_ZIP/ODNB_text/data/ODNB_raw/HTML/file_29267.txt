<span class="headword">White,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530<span class="mult">x</span>32&#150;1574), <span class="occ">church musician and composer</span>, was the son of Robert White (<i>d</i>. in or after 1574). By 1572 Robert White the elder was styled gentleman and had inherited or acquired the estate of Swallowfield, near Mannings Heath, Sussex. Nevertheless, he and his family appear to have been established in the London parish of St Andrew, Holborn, in whose church stood an especially fine organ donated apparently by the composer's grandfather and preserved from mid-Tudor iconoclasm by his father.<br>
<br>Of the younger Robert White's education and upbringing nothing is known, though a training as a chorister in some great London church appears probable. Between 29 September 1555 and Easter 1559 he was appointed a lay clerk of the choir of Trinity College, Cambridge. (The boy named White who was a chorister there during 1554&#150;5 cannot be identified with the composer.) The function of this choir, founded in 1554 under the auspices of Mary I and intended eventually to consist of eighteen singing-men and twelve boys and their master (who was also organist), was to sing in chapel the full round of the Latin Catholic service&#151;daily high mass and Lady mass and the eight hours services of the office&#151;plus the commemorative obits of the founders. Because certain of his Latin compositions were to texts stipulated in the college statutes of 1554, it appears certain that White's employment there had begun during Mary's reign.<br>
<br>In June 1559 White was promoted to the office of master of the choristers, and his accomplishments as a composer were recognized when on 13 December 1560 he was granted the degree of MusB by Cambridge University, conditional upon his composing a communion service to be sung in the university church on the day of conferment; this was duly accomplished. In support of his supplication White submitted his ten years of experience in the study of music; probably he was now approaching the age of thirty.<br>
<br>However, the Trinity College choir was still incomplete, consisting of but seven men (supplemented by a handful of musically competent fellows and former choristers) and eight boys. Further, by the restoration of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in June 1559, whereby observance was reduced to just three services a day, and also by new statutes devolved on the college in March 1560, the practice of music in the chapel was greatly attenuated. Finally, the appointment in August 1561 of the austerely protestant Robert Beaumont as master of Trinity College effectively spelt the end of elevated music-making in its chapel. On 29 September 1562 White departed to succeed the prominent composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27931/', "Christopher Tye (c.1505&#150;1571x3)")</script> as organist and master of the choristers of Ely Cathedral. This was a relatively conservative and well-endowed institution with a choir of (at this time) sixteen men and eight boys. Moreover, White was married to Ellen, daughter of Tye and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1574), though whether the marriage took place before or after he entered employment at Ely is not known. Of White's career there nothing is known other than that he had left by 29 September 1566 for appointment (at least by Christmas 1566) to the corresponding office at Chester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Though remote and poorly endowed, this cathedral maintained a choir of fourteen men and eight boys and their master, and in 1566 the chapter made a determined effort to enhance its provision for music, suppressing two choristerships to make available for the master of the choristers a much inflated annual stipend of &pound;16 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. There survive no details of White's exercise of his cathedral duties. However, its musicians were invited to contribute to the annual performance of the celebrated cycle of mystery plays mounted each Whitsuntide by the city guilds; and in 1567 and 1568 White was paid 4<i>s</i>. by the smiths and cutlers, apparently for his supply of singers, though perhaps also for his personal musical participation, while for their annual feast on 11 November 1569 the cordwainers paid him 4<i>d</i>. &#145;for our songs&#146;.<br>
<br>At Christmas 1569 White took up the prestigious office of organist and master of the choristers of Westminster Abbey, thus establishing himself as director of a prominent metropolitan choir of twenty-six men and ten boys, at an annual stipend of &pound;17 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. His indenture of appointment was agreed and sealed on 3 February 1570. By 1572 his father, evidently by now a widower, had come to live with the family in Almonry Yard; Robert senior made over apparently the totality of his property to his son in return for his keep.<br>
<br>During November&#150;December 1572 there was obtained for White's use in the abbey church the organ from St Andrew's, Holborn, originally donated to that church by his grandfather and probably by now disused in its parish location. In 1584 the parish churchwarden could only lament how the organs, that &#145;excellent instrument&#146;, now stood in Westminster Abbey, where &#145;they cannot be bought for any monye so highly they are estemed of for their goodness&#146;  (London, Guildhall Library, MS 4249, fol. 232<i>r</i>). Except for this episode, nothing is known of White's management and direction of the abbey's choir and music, though it was there that he spent the rest of his short life.<br>
<br>White was the most conspicuous among the generation of composers immediately preceding William Byrd, who reached maturity contemporaneously with the liturgical reformation and thus had barely completed their apprenticeship as composers for the traditional rite before encountering the obligation to work in a church converted to the ethic and aesthetic of protestantism. To this constraint White's response was to serve in the employment of the reformed church, but to compose music of religious character primarily for the novelty of private performance within the domestic context of the traditionalist home.<br>
<br>While much less varied in style, White's surviving music almost equals that of Thomas Tallis in quantity, and much of it falls little short in quality. Across a relatively brief creative life barely exceeding twenty years, the development of his compositional approach onward from the style of his earlier <i>cantus firmus</i> works exemplified strongly the contemporary process of evolution towards the high renaissance ideal of fully integrated imitation. However, his early death denied him the opportunity to engage this in the fully mature manner achieved by Byrd. His possession of an elegant combination of suppleness and strictness in contrapuntal technique was his strongest point, compensating for a prevailing severity in his invention of imitative points and for a certain blandness in terms of rhythmic vitality and harmonic fluidity. Moreover, the aesthetic of his period did not yet aspire to that intimate marriage of word and music that would emerge only after his death.<br>
<br>Most of White's surviving music consists of settings for unaccompanied voices in Latin. A few items are early pieces for the liturgy of the Catholic restoration under Mary. The text of the Marian votive antiphon <span class="italic">Regina celi letare</span> was specifically prescribed by the 1554 statutes of Trinity College, Cambridge, for performance as a grace following dinner in hall in Eastertide; <span class="italic">Libera nos domine</span> (a responsory from matins of the dead) was suitable for the three obits of special solemnity observed annually in chapel for founders and benefactors; and the psalm <span class="italic">Deus misereatur</span> was prescribed for extra-liturgical performance in chapel following the morrow mass on non-festal days under the Latin rite, and following early morning prayers after 1559. <span class="italic">Regina celi</span> and White's setting of the liturgical <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> are conspicuous for their confident and extrovert celebration of contemporary polyphonic styles based on <i>cantus firmus</i>.<br>
<br>Although no recusant, White's sympathies lay most probably with the old faith, and in his treatise <span class="italic">A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke</span> of 1597 Thomas Morley included him in a list of composers whose skill in composition he surreptitiously associated with their preservation of Catholic values. White's mature works consist mostly of settings of Latin psalms and of the <span class="roman">Lamentations of Jeremiah</span>. For these no place could be found in any service of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and clearly they were conceived for performance in the home, for use as recreation and edification in the households of educated adherents to the values of the old faith. At the time of his death White was owed the considerable sum of &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. by Edward Paston, a notable recusant and dedicated collector and preserver of music. It is entirely possible that this sum represented money owed by Paston for White's composition of music created in response to specific requests and commissions.<br>
<br>White's twelve settings of psalms and his settings from the <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> exhibit a consistent mastery of polyphonic technique. A disciplined vigour permeates and characterizes such pieces as the third setting of <span class="roman">Psalm 15</span>, <span class="italic">Domine quis habitabit</span>. Meanwhile, in the <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> and the more penitential of the psalms (for example, <span class="roman">Psalm 50</span>, <span class="italic">Miserere mei deus</span>) an underlying cogency and coherence of construction is combined throughout lengthy compositions with an arresting poignancy and true expressiveness of mood, sometimes dramatically heightened by the calculated interposition of passages exhibiting a homophonic character with chordal orientation.<br>
<br>Little music by White to vernacular texts has been preserved. For the liturgy of the 1559 prayer book nothing whatever is extant, while as anthems for use following morning or evening prayer only some three or four items survive, of which two have conflicting ascriptions and none is of great distinction. The dozen or so surviving instrumental works, originally for viols and mostly in the form of fantasia or <span class="roman">In nomine</span>, are likewise entirely competent though not particularly remarkable.<br>
<br>Morley twice commended White among those whom he considered to be excellent composers, and also listed him among those practitioners whose works he had perused for the authoritative treatment of certain technical points. However, perhaps White's most enduring achievement was his creation of a striking and extensive repertory of vocal music of elevated character for domestic performance. This served as a channel for the transmission of this thitherto predominantly courtly and clerical pastime into the educated gentry and burgess household, so both perpetuating a practice of secular cultivation of art music stretching back to the fifteenth-century carol and preparing and nurturing the ground for the later reception of the madrigal.<br>
<br>An epidemic of plague struck Westminster during autumn 1574, by which White's family was all but extinguished. On 7 November White, &#145;sicke in bodye&#146;, made his will and on 11 November he was buried in St Margaret's churchyard. Ellen White made her will on 21 November, and letters of administration for both wills were issued on 8 December. Of at least five children, the couple were survived by only two daughters. White's work was often attributed in seventeenth-century manuscripts to <a name="cosubject_29261"></a><span class="headword">Matthew White</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1641)<span class="occ"></span>. Matthew White was a <span class="occ">church musician</span>. Of his parentage, education, and musical training nothing is known. He was admitted a vicar-choral of Wells Cathedral on 30 January 1611 and, already an ordained priest, held in plurality the office of gospeller in the Chapel Royal of James I, singing bass, from 2 November 1613 to 24 September 1614. Thereafter he occurs again as vicar-choral of Wells, and on 18 July 1629, in rare recognition of his superior accomplishments as a composer, he was admitted to the degrees of Mus.Bac. and Mus.Doc. of Oxford University. By 22 September 1635 he had become a vicar-choral of Hereford Cathedral, and by the time of his death held also the office of succentor. By 1640 he had been collated in plurality to the vicarage of the parish of St Nicholas, Hereford. He died before 16 October 1641, when a successor was appointed to the succentorship of Hereford Cathedral, vacant by his death.<br>
<br>It is unlikely that either he or <a href="#cosubject_29278">William White [<i>see below</i>]</a> is to be identified with the Mr White who was the composer of some lightweight catches published by John Hilton and John Playford from 1652 onwards. Indeed, of surviving compositions that are certainly his there remains nothing but two anthems, neither now complete. However, it is a tribute to his contemporary reputation that copyists mistakenly attributed to him music actually by composers of the standing of Robert Parsons, William Mundy, and Robert White.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_29278"></a><span class="headword">William White</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1571, <em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was baptized at St Nicholas, Durham on 17 May 1571, the son of Miles White. Probably he is to be identified with the boy named White who sang as chorister of the choir of Durham Cathedral from 1580 to 1587, and until 1590 continued his education at the King's School. By 28 April 1603 he was a lay clerk of the choir of Westminster Abbey, but at least by the early 1630s had returned to Durham. In London he was a friend of the composer Thomas Tomkins, whose dedication to him of the madrigal &#145;Adieu, ye city-prisoning towers&#146; in 1622 may perhaps have marked White's return to the north. At the end of the seventeenth century a local historian recollected him as &#145;a celebrated doctor&#146; resident in Elvet, Durham. White died probably in Durham, and was buried on 11 February 1634.<br>
<br>Of William White's composition of sacred music there survive one incomplete verse anthem and three full anthems, including the popular &#145;O praise God in his holiness&#146; once attributed to Robert White. Fourteen pieces for consort of viols, mostly written in free contrapuntal fantasia form but including also two pavans, were copied into numerous early seventeenth-century manuscript sources. These items owed such high regard to their fluency and idiomatic skill, especially in composition in five and six parts.<br>
