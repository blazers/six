<span class="headword">Stocker,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1563&#150;1593), <span class="occ">translator</span>, described himself as a gentleman and may have been descended from a noble family, though virtually nothing is known of it. However, his student status&#151;he matriculated as a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1563&#151;argues against a distinguished pedigree. Apparently he did not take a degree. For a quarter of a century he was an industrious, though undistinguished, translator of works previously published in French. His first translation, issued in 1569, was <span class="italic">A Righte Noble and Pleasant History of the Successors of Alexander the Great</span>, the first three books of which were by the first-century-<span class="smallcap">BC</span> historian Diodorus Siculus and the fourth by Plutarch; Stocker translated the French edition of Claude de Seyssel and dedicated his volume to Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick. In the same year Stocker delivered an English translation of a work by Barth&eacute;lemy Causs&eacute;, <span class="italic">The Very True Shield, and Buckler of Faith</span>, which he may have prepared, to the printer Henry Wykes; Causs&eacute; was refuting Nicole Grenier's Catholic polemic <span class="italic">Le bouclier de la foy</span>.<br>
<br>Stocker's keen interest in Reformed protestantism is evinced in a series of nine works translated and published between 1580 and 1592. Four of these were translations of works by John Calvin, entitled: <span class="italic">Two and Twentie Sermons on Psalm 119</span> (1580); <span class="italic">Divers Sermons &hellip; Concerning the Divinitie, Humanitie, and Nativitie of &hellip; Christe</span> (1581), dedicated to Edward de Vere, earl of Oxford, with an epistle by Conrad Badius; <span class="italic">An Excellent Treatise of the Immortalytie of the Soule</span> (1581); and <span class="italic">Sermons &hellip; on the Historie of Melchisedech &hellip; also Abrahams Faith</span> (1592). Although William Chauncie translated the first part of Pierre Viret's original as <span class="italic">The Worlde Possessed with Devils</span> (1583) before Stocker could work on it, the latter prepared the sequel, <span class="italic">The Second Part of the Demoniacke Worlde</span> (1583), with an epistle dedicatory to Sir John Higham. He also translated as <span class="italic">The Cauteles, Canon, and Ceremonies, of the &hellip; Popish Masse</span> (1584) Viret's original annotated edition.<br>
<br>Stocker contributed to the growing sense of Calvinist internationalism by translating as <span class="italic">A Tragicall Historie of the Troubles and Civile Warres of the Lowe Countries</span> (1583) a work written by either the Flemish Calvinist nobleman Philips van Marnix van Sant Aldegonde or Karel Rijckewaert; Stocker dedicated this work to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. In November 1584 he completed <span class="italic">The Popes Canons: wherewith the Masters of Sorbone are Confuted</span> (1584 or 1585), which was based on the views of Theodore Beza. Then he translated as <span class="italic">The Lamentations and Holy Mourninges of the Prophet Jeremiah, with a Lamentable Paraphrase and Exhortation</span> (1587?) the work by the Swiss Reformed minister Daniel Tossanus (Toussain). One of Stocker's last known translations was <span class="italic">The Holy Love of Heavenly Wisdome</span> (1594), a meditation on some of the psalms, the Lord's prayer, and Jeremiah's <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> by the French lawyer and philosopher Guillaume Du Vair. Later editions were published with varying titles, the second edition appearing as <span class="italic">A Most Heavenly and Plentifull Treasure</span> (1609). Stocker's importance rests on his translations of Reformed protestant books for an English audience, which helped foster the perception of Calvinism as an international movement.<br>
