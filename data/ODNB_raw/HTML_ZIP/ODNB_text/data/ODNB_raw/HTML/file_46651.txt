<span class="headword">Maybrick,  Michael</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Stephen Adams]</span>  (1841&#150;1913), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was born on 31 January 1841 (not 1844, as is often stated) at 8 Church Alley, Liverpool, the fourth of the seven sons of William Maybrick (1815&#150;1853?), an engraver, and his wife, Susannah (1815?&#150;1883?). His grandfather and father served as parish clerk at St Peter's, Liverpool, and were minor composers; his uncle Michael (1799&#150;1846) was organist at St Peter's, wrote sacred music, and conducted the Liverpool Choral Society. Proficient on the piano by the age of eight, the young Michael studied the organ with W. T. Best and at the age of fifteen became organist of St Peter's; he also wrote anthems and had a work performed in London. In 1865 he went to Leipzig to study keyboard and harmony with Carl Reinecke, Ignaz Moscheles, and Louis Plaidy, but later decided to perfect his fine baritone voice under Gaetano Nava in Milan. After gaining experience in Italian theatres, he was acclaimed in London on 25 February 1869 in Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Elijah</span>. Success as Telramund in Wagner's <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> led to appearances with Charlotte Sainton-Dolby, including her farewell concert on 6 June 1870, and to regular engagements at the English festivals and with Carl Rosa's opera company.<br>
<br>By the early 1870s Maybrick was already presenting his own songs, beginning with &#145;A Warrior Bold&#146;. Published under the pseudonym Stephen Adams and mostly with lyrics by Fred Weatherly, these achieved extraordinary popularity: the early sea song &#145;Nancy Lee&#146; sold more than 100,000 copies in two years. The composer's versatile output included other sea songs like &#145;The Tar's Farewell&#146;, &#145;They All Love Jack&#146;, and &#145;The Midshipmite&#146;, sentimental pieces like &#145;Your Dear Brown Eyes&#146;, romances like &#145;The Children of the City&#146;, and sacred songs like &#145;The Blue Alsatian Mountains&#146;, &#145;The Star of Bethlehem&#146;, and the well-loved &#145;Holy City&#146;. He also celebrated national occasions, as in &#145;The Veteran's Song&#146; for the coronation of Edward VII. He performed his ballads at St James's Hall matin&eacute;e concerts, and in 1884 toured North America with them. Though later disparaged, they are direct and sincere and audiences found them ennobling. With his resonant voice and winning smile, the tall, distinguished-looking Maybrick had great presence on the stage. His character was more complex: friends spoke of his charming personality, but detractors thought him arrogant and vain.<br>
<br>Although Maybrick never ceased to compose, and became vice-president of Trinity College, London, he abandoned public singing after the conviction of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54557/', "Florence Maybrick")</script> for the murder of her husband, James, his brother, in 1889; he wished her life to be spared (as it was), but had largely helped to instigate this controversial case. On 9 March 1893 he married his forty-year-old housekeeper, Laura Withers, and settled with her at Ryde, where he had purchased Lynthorpe; they were joined there by James's orphaned children. In a new civic career, Maybrick became chairman of the Isle of Wight Hospital, justice of the peace, and five times mayor of Ryde. He also played cricket, yachted, cycled, and was an active freemason. While convalescing at St Ann's Hotel, Buxton, from periodic gout, he died of heart failure on 26 August 1913, and was buried four days afterwards at All Saints', Ryde, survived by his wife.<br>
