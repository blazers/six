<span class="headword">Setchel,  Sarah</span>  (1813&#150;1894), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in London, and baptized on 4 June 1813 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, the younger of the two daughters of John Frederick Setchel (<i>d</i>. 1846), bookseller in King Street, Covent Garden, and his wife, Mary. Her father collected art books, and wanted his daughters to become artists, but Sarah Setchel did not show any interest in drawing until after she left school, when she began copying in the British Museum and the National Gallery; she also took lessons in miniature painting on ivory from Louisa Sharpe. She exhibited six portraits at the Royal Academy between 1832 and 1845, and also exhibited fifteen pictures at the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street until 1840. At first her subjects were usually children, but from 1834 she also included literary subjects, scenes from Shakespeare and Scott. Scenes of humble life and cottagers in particular appealed to her.<br>
<br>In 1841 Sarah Setchel was elected a member of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, and in 1842 exhibited what came to be known as <span class="italic">The Momentous Question</span>, which established her reputation and led to many commissions. The subject matter was taken from George Crabbe's <span class="italic">Tales of the Hall</span> (1819), and when it was first exhibited the painting appeared with a long quotation from Crabbe. Depicting a prison interior, with a girl visiting a young man under threat of death, it became very popular as an engraving by Samuel Bellin. Her next exhibit was a miniature of her father (exh. New Society of Painters in Water Colours, 1845); it was much admired by the art critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, who said that it placed her &#145;at the head of all lady miniature painters&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 26 April 1845).<br>
<br>However, Sarah Setchel's eyesight was deteriorating, and she began to paint and exhibit less. After the death of her father in 1846 she gave lessons in watercolour painting to Mary Ann Criddle, who also suffered from poor eyesight and had given up painting in oils. She exhibited a few times at the New Society of Painters in Water Colours between 1848 and 1856, and two of her literary paintings were engraved: <span class="italic">And Ye shall Walk in Silk Attire</span> (exh. 1848), and <span class="italic">The Heart's Resolve</span> (exh. 1850), from Crabbe's tale of <span class="italic">Jessie and Colin</span> (engraved by Bellin). In 1860 Sarah Setchel went to Switzerland, where she consulted a German eye specialist in Graeforth, but her eyes continued to get worse. She moved to Sudbury, near Harrow, Middlesex, to live with her sister, and only exhibited two more paintings, in the 1866&#150;8 winter exhibitions of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours; she resigned from the society in 1886. Sarah Setchel died unmarried on 9 January 1894 at 3 Lyon Villas, Sudbury. Two of her watercolours, one of which is <span class="italic">The Momentous Question</span>, are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
