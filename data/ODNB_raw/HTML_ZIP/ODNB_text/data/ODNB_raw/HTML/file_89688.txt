<span class="headword">Pitt <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grenville]</span>,  Hester</span>, countess of Chatham and <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Chatham  (1720&#150;1803), <span class="occ">political wife</span>, was born in London on 8 November 1720, the sixth child and only daughter of Richard Grenville (1678&#150;1727) and his wife, Hester, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Temple, subsequently <i>suo jure</i> Countess Temple (<i>bap</i>. 1684, <i>d</i>. 1752), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27118/', "Sir Richard Temple, third baronet")</script>, of Stowe, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Details of her education are unknown, but from her earliest years she was at the heart of a political network, a place she held throughout her life. Her brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11489/', "George Grenville")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11495/', "Richard Grenville, second Earl Temple")</script>, and their cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17306/', "George Lyttelton")</script> formed the &#145;Cobham cousindom&#146; along with Hester's future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22337/', "William Pitt (1708&#150;1778)")</script>. Her childhood appears to have been happy, spent with her devoted brothers at Stowe and the Grenville estate of Wotton Underwood, also in Buckinghamshire, and visiting Bath and Tunbridge Wells, riding horses, and developing her zeal for politics and business affairs. There is some evidence that she attracted a number of suitors, including her cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2193/', "Richard Berenger")</script>, but she remained unmarried until she was thirty-three years old, when romance blossomed with the forty-six-year-old Pitt, whom she had known for over twenty years. Although the marriage was perceived by many as an astute partnership, allowing political allies to become brothers, it was not a loveless, tactical match. The couple's letters were full of declarations of their affection, and their pain when apart from one another; Hester wrote to him just before their wedding: &#145;the thought that I am in possession of your heart is a pleasure and flattery beyond every other&#146;  (Williams, 1.242). The couple married on 16 November 1754 at her house in Argyle Street, and they enjoyed a ten-day honeymoon at West Wickham, Kent, the home of her first cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29084/', "Gilbert West")</script> and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bartlett.<br>
<br>The marriage was a happy one, and they formed a strong partnership, moving to a house at Hayes, Kent, in 1756. Lady Hester Pitt (as she was known until 1761) was an important political confidante to her husband and later her son, and their letters were full of political news. In 1755, for example, she helped the countess of Bute to sell tickets for the opening night of a play written by a shared ally, while their husbands discussed how to prevent war on the continent. While she often played the role of political wife with a great deal of na&iuml;vety, especially when soothing relations between her husband and her brothers, it is unclear whether this was deliberate or affected. She recognized the importance of maintaining support from her allies for the future of their children, while staying loyal to her husband; Horace Walpole noted: &#145;Is this a peace patched up by Livia for the sake of her children?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 7.241).<br>
<br>It was not only for political reasons that Lady Hester felt the need to maintain the support of her family and friends; they were an important source of loans and income to the Pitts. William had an extravagant nature, but was without a large independent income on which to base his expenditure; as early as 1755 Lady Hester's brother Earl Temple felt obliged to give them &pound;1000 a year after Pitt had been dismissed as paymaster-general. Following Pitt's resignation from office in 1761 the couple welcomed the gift of an annual pension of &pound;3000, which was not only to be paid for his lifetime, but also for that of Lady Hester and their eldest son. Pitt was also the recipient of a number of posthumous benefactions, including a sizeable legacy from Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, and in 1765 the estates of Sir William Pynsent who, according to Hester, had never met Pitt. This legacy gave them the property of Burton Pynsent, at Curry Rivel, Somerset, which became her favoured residence until her death. Despite this good fortune, her financial acumen was tested as she dealt with the many debts that her husband incurred.<br>
<br>It was not only financial concerns that fell to Hester; during her husband's illnesses she would take on a number of his political duties. Walpole recognized her potential as a politician soon after the marriage, and joked in 1757 that the wives of parliamentarians, including Hester, should &#145;take the government upon themselves instead of their husbands&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.53). She gained a great deal of respect for her capable manner; the banker Thomas Coutts, for example, described her as &#145;the cleverest <i>man</i> of her time in politics and business&#146;  (Williams, 2.244). As part of the settlement on Pitt's resignation from office in 1761, she was created Baroness Chatham in her own right, which was in part a recognition of her own political acumen as well as of Pitt's status and her membership of the Grenville dynasty. The award was unpopular, and she was called by the public Lady Cheat'em. She became countess of Chatham by courtesy when her husband was created an earl in 1766. While her husband was ill she wrote a large number of letters on his behalf to fellow politicians, including the duke of Newcastle and her husband's kinsman Thomas Pitt, first Baron Camelford. This was particularly important during the Chatham administration of 1766&#150;8, when Chatham's poor health deteriorated yet further; when members of the cabinet were unable to gain their leader's guidance they applied to his wife instead. She not only took over his correspondence and acted as his link to the political world, but also met senior politicians on his behalf. The duke of Grafton, encouraged by George III, contacted Lady Chatham in October 1768 to discuss the removal of the earl of Shelburne from office. Their long meeting and her loyal and diplomatic answers indicate that she was an able, but not always willing, politician.<br>
<br>Evidence suggests that Lady Chatham preferred domestic affairs. The Pitts were devoted parents of their two daughters and three boys, whom William Pitt called Hester's &#145;sweet little race&#146;  (Birdwood, 7). Although William was concerned with the care of their children, his political responsibilities often kept him away from home. However, Lady Chatham recognized the need to manage the domestic world without him, and she wrote of her acceptance that his responsibilities &#145;claim all your care for poor England and that she is a rival I must submit to&#146;  (ibid., 8). Their eldest child was Hester (1755&#150;1780), who later married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26241/', "Charles Stanhope, third Earl Stanhope")</script>. In 1756 she gave birth to John (1756&#150;1835) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22330/', "Pitt, John, second earl of Chatham")</script>], and then Harriot (1758&#150;1786); when, having married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64114/', "Edward James Eliot")</script>, Harriot died in childbirth with her first child, Harriot Hester, Hester took the baby granddaughter into her home. Hester enjoyed a very close relationship with her second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22338/', "William Pitt (1759&#150;1806)")</script>, known as Pitt the younger. The couple's youngest son was James Charles (1761&#150;1780), whose death in the West Indies caused Hester much sorrow. Hester spent a great deal of time with all the children at Hayes, and she was largely responsible for their upbringing, although when her husband suffered from ill health his welfare was her priority. She wrote of her distress at Chatham's recurrent illness, admitting that it made her &#145;a very suffering miserable person&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 59490, fol. 26). His death in 1778, although not unexpected, caused her great distress, and she wrote that &#145;the blessings with which heaven had alleviated the bitterness of sorrow are felt by me as they ought&#146;  (ibid., fol. 67). She was left without a regular income, as her pension was often in arrears, and had to cover the expenses of two sons just as their careers were being launched.<br>
<br>In her widowhood Lady Chatham continued to be part of the political world through her son William Pitt the younger. She had always expected great things of him, writing a few weeks after his birth: &#145;I cannot help believing the little William is to become a personage&#146;  (Ayling, 248). They continued to have a close relationship after his father's death, and it was he who hurried down to Burton Pynsent to comfort her in 1780 following the death of James Charles. Hester exercised a great deal of influence over Pitt the younger, and he often sought her advice and reassurance on matters personal and political, especially in his early years. In turn, Pitt often managed his mother's affairs, particularly when their concerns needed representation in parliament. Although her husband's debts of &pound;20,000 were settled by parliament at his death, her income was often insufficient, and she was dependent on loans and gifts to cover her expenses, many of which came from her second son. He frequently wrote of politics in his letters to his mother, indicating that he not only believed his mother was interested, but that he also welcomed her opinion. She was keen to use his position in society to help her friends and relations, many of whom were also her creditors, and she often wrote to him to request placements, jobs, or promotions for them.<br>
<br>Lady Chatham also had a wide circle of influential friends including Maria Beckford, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamilton, wife of her husband's political ally William Beckford, Frances (Fanny) Boscawen, and Elizabeth Montagu, who took it upon herself to entertain the young Pitt children by offering to take them to concerts and the theatre. Her closest female friend was Catherine Stapleton (1733&#150;1815), who cared for the orphaned children of Lady Chatham's brother, George Grenville, and who lived with Lady Chatham in Burton Pynsent as a companion from about 1782 onwards. Lady Chatham also had the company of two of her granddaughters in her latter years, the orphaned daughter of Harriot and the eldest daughter of her first child, Hester, the traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26247/', "Lady Hester Stanhope (1776&#150;1839)")</script>. Lady Chatham died at Burton Pynsent on 3 April 1803, and was buried near her husband in Westminster Abbey on 16 April 1803.<br>
