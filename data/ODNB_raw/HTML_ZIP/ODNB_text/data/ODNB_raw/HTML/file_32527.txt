<span class="headword">Conder,  Claude Reignier</span>  (1848&#150;1910), <span class="occ">army officer and explorer of Palestine</span>, born at Cheltenham on 29 December 1848, was the son of Francis Roubiliac Conder (1815&#150;1889), a civil engineer, and his wife, Anne Matilda Colt (1823&#150;1890). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6059/', "Josiah Conder")</script>, his grandfather, married a granddaughter of the sculptor Louis Fran&ccedil;ois Roubiliac.<br>
<br>After spending eight years of his youth in Italy, Conder passed from University College, London, to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, where he distinguished himself in surveying and drawing. He was commissioned lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 8 January 1870, and after two years at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham was selected with the assent of the military authorities to continue a scientific survey of western Palestine, which had been begun by engineer officers under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund some seven years earlier.<br>
<br>In July 1872 Conder took charge of the survey party at Nablus in Samaria and began by measuring a base line, about 4 miles long, near Ramlah on the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem. The triangulation was carried gradually over the whole country. After three years the greater part of the country west of the Jordan had been surveyed and a mass of information about the topography and archaeology of the country collected, while many places mentioned in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and previously unknown had been identified. Conder also devoted himself to the languages of the country and to the decipherment of ancient inscriptions, to which he brought abundant ingenuity.<br>
<br>An attack on Conder and his party by the inhabitants of Safed, a town in the hills north-west of the Sea of Galilee (July 1875), in which Conder and others of the party were seriously injured, temporarily suspended the survey. Conder was sufficiently recovered to return to England in October 1875, after having surveyed 4700 square miles of western Palestine. The plotting of the maps from the field survey data and the preparation of the descriptive <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> were then started. A map, on a scale of one inch to the mile, was printed at the Ordnance Survey office, Southampton, and, with seven volumes of <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, was issued by the committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund in 1880. Conder had been helped in the survey work by C. F. Tyrwhitt-Drake and in both the survey and the subsequent work by H. H. Kitchener, later Earl Kitchener of Khartoum; but it was Conder's name that was chiefly associated with the survey, which won wide acclaim for its contribution to the history, geography, and linguistic understanding of the region.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1877, at Guildford, Surrey, Conder married Myra Rachel, the eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General Edward Archibald Foord (<i>d</i>. 1899) of the Royal (Madras) Engineers. He returned to regimental duty in May 1878, and was employed for three years on the new defences of the Forth and stationed in Edinburgh. He continued his studies of the history and archaeology of the Holy Land and adjacent countries. In 1878 he published his first book, <span class="italic">Tent Work in Palestine</span>, illustrated with his own drawings. It gives a popular account of the survey operations and of the customs of the Palestinians, of various <span class="roman">Bible</span> sites, and of the topography of Jerusalem. In 1879 he published <span class="italic">Judas Maccabaeus and the Jewish War of Independence</span> and, in collaboration with his father, <span class="italic">Handbook to the Bible</span>. These works were popular, and went through several editions.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1881 Conder resumed his work for the Palestine Exploration Fund in the country east of the Jordan. Near the lake of Hims in the valley of the Orontes, he discovered the remains of the ancient city of Kadesh; then, going south and crossing the Jordan, a base line was measured between Heshbon and Medeba. Conder devoted special attention to the many prehistoric stone monuments in the district, photographing, describing, and making plans of them. His progress was impeded by the Turks, but he acted with great discretion, and managed to complete the survey of about 500 square miles.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1882 Conder was promoted captain, and in March and April he conducted princes Albert Victor and George of Wales (later George V) on a tour through Palestine. He wrote a report on the sacred harem at Hebron and another on the princes' Palestine tour (<span class="italic">Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement</span>, 1882).<br>
<br>After his return home in June 1882, Conder joined the expedition to Egypt, under Sir Garnet Wolseley, to suppress the rebellion of Arabi Pasha. He was appointed a deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general on the staff of the intelligence department. In Egypt his knowledge of Arabic and of Eastern people proved most useful. He was present at the action of Qassasin, the battle of Tell al-Kebir, and the advance to Cairo, but then, suffering from typhoid fever, he was invalided home. For his services he received the war medal with clasp for Tell al-Kebir, the khedive's bronze star, and the fourth class of the order of the Mejidiye. On his return to good health he began plotting the survey and preparing the memoir of eastern Palestine. In 1883 he published <span class="italic">Heth and Moab</span>, a popular account of his second expedition to Palestine.<br>
<br>On 10 November 1883 Conder took command of a depot company at Chatham. A year later, as deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general in the intelligence department, he joined the staff of Major-General Sir Charles Warren in the Bechuanaland expedition to South Africa, and the topographical work was entrusted to him. Having declined an offer of a land commissionership in South Africa, he returned to the command of his company at Chatham in October 1885. While there he published some important works: <span class="italic">Syrian Stone Lore</span> (1886), <span class="italic">The Canaanites</span> (1887), and <span class="italic">Altaic Hieroglyphs and Hittite Inscriptions</span> (1887), where he proved his philological acumen and ingenuity.<br>
<br>On 1 July 1887 Conder went to Plymouth to work at the Ordnance Survey, and from 1888 to 1895 he was at Southampton in charge of the engraving department. He assisted Sir Charles Wilson, then director-general of the Ordnance Survey, with the publications of the Palestine Pilgrims Text Society, of which Sir Charles was the director. In 1891 he published <span class="italic">Palestine</span>, a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the history and geography of the country, and in 1893 he wrote <span class="italic">The Tell Amarna Tablets</span>, a translation and description of cuneiform characters written about 1480 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> from Palestine and Syria to the king of Egypt; they throw much light on the connection between the countries.<br>
<br>Conder had been promoted major on 1 July 1888. After superintending the construction of the new defences for the naval base of Berehaven in 1894, in 1895 he directed public works for the relief of distress in Ireland. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 12 August 1895 and appointed commanding royal engineer at Weymouth. In his five years there he wrote some of his most important works, notably <span class="italic">The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</span> (1897) and <span class="italic">The Hittites and their Language</span> (1898), while engaged on technical work at the naval base at Portland. He was promoted brevet colonel on 12 August 1899, and a year later was placed on half pay. Until his retirement on 2 November 1904 he was employed with the Ordnance Survey in Ireland. Thereafter he lived at Cheltenham, where he died, at his home, St Oswald's, Tivoli Road, on 16 February 1910, following a stroke a month earlier. He left a widow, a daughter, and a son.<br>
<br>Conder was a prolific author of both scholarly and popular works. Although his linguistic theories were contested even in his own lifetime, his reputation as a great explorer and surveyor has endured.<br>
