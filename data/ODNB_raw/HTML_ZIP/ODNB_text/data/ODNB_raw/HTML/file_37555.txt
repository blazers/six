<span class="headword">Hoby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dakins]</span>,  Margaret</span>, Lady Hoby  (<em>bap. </em>1571, <em>d.</em> 1633), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was baptized on 10 February 1571, the only child of Arthur Dakins (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1517, <i>d</i>. 1592), gentleman and JP of Linton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife, Thomasine Gye (<i>d</i>. 1613). She was educated in the household of Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, president of the council in the north, and she learned there the puritan habits of self-examination and regular religious exercises which she later practised in her own household. As an heiress she was a valuable commodity in the Elizabethan marriage market, and she was married three times, to well-connected younger sons approved by the Hastings family.<br>
<br>In 1588 or 1589 she married Walter (<i>b</i>.1569), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7568/', "Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex")</script>, the Irish adventurer. The younger Walter was the brother of Robert, second earl of Essex, and stepson of the countess of Huntingdon's brother, Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. The manor and parsonage of Hackness in the North Riding were purchased for the couple, and remained Margaret's property after the death of Devereux at the siege of Rouen in 1591. Before the end of the year she had been married again, to Thomas Sidney, brother of Sir Philip Sidney, the poet, and nephew of the countess of Huntingdon. When Sidney died in 1595, Margaret agreed to Huntingdon's deathbed request that she marry another suitor of 1591, Sir Thomas Posthumous Hoby (1566&#150;1644), second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13414/', "Sir Thomas Hoby")</script>, of Bisham, Berkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13411/', "Russell, Elizabeth, Lady Russell")</script>]. They were married on 9 August 1596 and lived at Hackness, where Hoby established a political powerbase (he was JP and MP) and a reputation as a humourless puritan and cantankerous opponent of rival, especially Catholic, gentry.<br>
<br>Margaret Hoby's diary&#151;the earliest known by an Englishwoman&#151;is notable for its depiction of the domestic disciplines of Elizabethan puritanism. Written between 1599 and 1605, it describes the religious exercises and prayers for the whole household as well as the private prayers and readings which occupied a large part of each day, and in which Lady Hoby was guided by her chaplain, Richard Rhodes. The diary also shows other aspects of the household routine of a gentlewoman: managing the estate in her husband's frequent absences, supervising and paying servants, sorting linen, playing music, gardening, giving medical advice and treatment to neighbours and tenants. It tells little about the writer's private feelings. It is a document written as a pious exercise, and its discipline and restraint spring from that. References to Sir Thomas Hoby are perhaps deceptively formal, though Margaret was strong-minded enough to resist until 1632 his request that she make over her Hackness and other properties to him and his heirs. She had no children herself. Puritanism, the household, and property dominate the diary, as perhaps her whole life.<br>
<br>Lady Hoby died on 4 September 1633 and was buried on 6 September in the chancel of Hackness church, where her husband erected an alabaster monument to her. It still survives, but St Margaret's Chapel in Harwood Dale, which Hoby also built to her memory, is in ruins.<br>
