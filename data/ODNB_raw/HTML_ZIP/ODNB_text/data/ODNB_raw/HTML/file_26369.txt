<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stephen, Sir  Alfred</span>  (1802&#150;1894), <span class="occ">judge and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 20 August 1802 at Basseterre, St Kitts, West Indies, the fourth son of the ten children of John Stephen (1771&#150;1834) and his wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pasmore (1774?&#150;1863). His father, the youngest brother of James Stephen (1758&#150;1832), practised law at St Kitts, London, and New South Wales, where he was appointed solicitor-general in 1824 and judge in 1825.<br>
<br>Alfred Stephen went to England in 1804 with his mother. He was for a year (1810) at Charterhouse, and afterwards at school in Martock, Somerset, and at Honiton grammar school, Devon. In 1815 he returned with his father to St Kitts, where he was a lieutenant in the militia and read a little law. In 1818 he was sent to London, entered Lincoln's Inn, and became a pupil successively of his cousins Henry John and James Stephen junior. He was remarkable for his high spirits and good humour, which led him into adventures at Vauxhall and elsewhere, but he did not neglect his professional training, and was called to the bar on 20 November 1823. At the church of St George the Martyr, Holborn, on 22 June 1824 he married Virginia, the daughter of Matthew Consett. In August of that year they sailed in the <i>Cumberland</i> for Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>On the separation of that colony from New South Wales in May 1825 Stephen was appointed solicitor-general with the right of private practice. He took part in framing the new laws and organizing courts. A cocksure young man, in 1828 he questioned the validity of all land titles in the colony (made in the name of the governor rather than that of the sovereign) and later exposed extensive land jobbery. He found difficulty in discharging both his public and his private duties, but complained that his salary was insufficient for him to give up private practice. The introduction of trial by jury, which he supported, involved a long struggle, but was effected in 1834. During a visit to England, in January 1833 Stephen was appointed attorney-general. Afterwards he framed more than a hundred statutes, some of which were adopted in other colonies.<br>
<br>The loss of his wife in childbirth (leaving seven children) and the death of a brother, both in 1837, left Stephen very ill, and he resigned his position. He married, on 21 July 1838, Eleanor Martha Pickard (<i>d</i>. 1886), the daughter of the Revd W. Bedford, in St David's, Hobart Town, and practised at the bar until 1839, when he was appointed judge of the supreme court of New South Wales and moved to Sydney. In 1844 he was made acting chief justice (confirmed in office on 2 June 1845). As a judge he was distinguished for courtesy and firmness. His decisions were often models of lucidity and showed his versatility over the whole range of the law, but were also pragmatic and narrow in application, rarely forming precedents. He would on occasion sit in court until 6 a.m. and begin a summing-up at 4 a.m. with a perfectly fresh memory. As a judicial administrator of great ability he made the law respected in New South Wales in the face of such obstacles as personal antipathies between the judges, antique procedure, excessive litigation, and inadequate accommodation.<br>
<br>Every year Stephen went on circuit, involving difficult and dangerous journeys on land or by sea. Although a humane man, he had a reputation for judicial severity. He supported the retention of capital punishment, which he believed to be the only penalty dreaded by criminals, and in the upsurge of bushranging in the 1860s persuaded the government to carry the <span class="roman">Felons Apprehension Act</span> (1865), which made it a felony to harbour or assist a bushranger. His retirement in 1873 was received with strong expressions of sympathy from his colleagues and a gift of 1000 guineas, raised by public subscription.<br>
<br>As the first president (1856&#150;7) of the nominated legislative council after responsible government, Stephen had carefully prepared all the rules and forms of the house. He was again a member of the council from 1875 to 1890. Improving legislation that came up from the assembly, acting as unofficial parliamentary draftsman, and serving on sundry standing and select committees afforded him &#145;<i>much</i> pleasure&#146;  (A. Stephen to H. Parkes, 18 March 1879, Parkes MSS).<br>
<br>In 1870&#150;72 Stephen chaired the law reform commission. The <span class="roman">Criminal Law Consolidation Bill</span>, one of the three measures recommended by the commission, was, according to J. M. Bennett, &#145;profoundly influenced by Stephen alone and by the stimulus he had derived from reforms to the English criminal law effected by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen&#146;  (<span class="italic">A History of the Supreme Court of New South Wales</span>, 1974, 73). The bill was improved by Stephen during its long passage and eventually became law in 1883. <span class="italic">The Criminal Law Manual</span>, comprising the act, was published by Sir Alfred and Alexander Oliver that year.<br>
<br>In 1879 Stephen opposed a divorce bill introduced in the legislature, but observation of the numerous cases of hardship caused by the desertion of wives led him to change his mind. In 1886 he introduced a bill permitting divorce for desertion, habitual drunkenness, imprisonment for at least seven years, and assault on the petitioner, which was carried the following year, but the measure was refused the royal assent in London. Stephen replied to W. E. Gladstone upon this question in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> for June 1891. In spite of a strong opposition, especially from the clergy, the <span class="roman">Divorce Extension Act</span> was assented to by the queen in council in July 1892.<br>
<br>Having administered the government in 1872 after the departure of Lord Belmore, Stephen was lieutenant-governor from 1875 until 1891, and on three further occasions acted as governor. He served on the council of education from November 1873 until its suppression in 1882, on the senate of the university, and on the councils of many other public institutions; he was an enthusiastic trustee of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. He was knighted in 1846, was made CB in 1862, KCMG in 1874, GCMG in 1884, and became a privy councillor in 1893.<br>
<br>Stephen visited England again in 1860, but otherwise never left the Australian colonies, where the vigour of intellect which he retained until the end and his charm of character gave him the position of a venerated patriarch, notwithstanding &#145;his great failing in meddling in matters that did not concern him&#146;  (Roger Therry to James McArthur, 11 Jan 1861, McArthur MSS). Stephen himself regretted having &#145;said too many things in the excitement of debate, &amp; speaking in Court wh: I have found to be quite mistaken&#146;  (A. Stephen to H. Parkes, n.d., Parkes MSS). Continuing to read widely, he was full of intellectual interests, and welcomed many distinguished visitors to Australia; J. A. Froude, in <span class="italic">Oceana</span> (1886), observed that Stephen shared &#145;the family perception of the ridiculous and humorous side of things&#146;  (p. 162). Stephen kept up a close correspondence to the last with his English relatives, including Leslie Stephen, his godson. In his last years he wrote some interesting <span class="italic">Jottings from Memory</span> (privately printed, 1889 and 1891) describing his early life. His frame was spare and very active and he remained interested in many charities, especially in the Industrial Blind Institution. He died at his home, 24 College Street, Sydney, on 15 October 1894 and was buried in St Jude's churchyard there on 16 October amid many demonstrations of respect.<br>
<br>Stephen and his first wife had five sons and four daughters (two children died in infancy), while he and his second wife produced four sons and five daughters; his descendants at the time of his death numbered over a hundred. One of his sons, Alfred, was a canon of the Anglican cathedral in Sydney, and another, Matthew Henry, became judge of the supreme court in the colony.<br>
