<span class="headword">Carnegie,  David, of Colluthie and Kinnaird</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4718/', "Sir Robert Carnegie (d. 1566)")</script> of Kinnaird, Forfarshire, lord of session, and his wife, Margaret Guthrie (<i>d</i>. 1571), and first appears in official records in 1555&#150;6 as a debt manager. Given an estate by his father, at Panbride, Forfarshire, he also acquired through his first marriage, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. before 4 March 1567), daughter of Henry Ramsay of Colluthie, the latter's estate in Fife, which became his main base; the couple had two daughters. His second marriage, by contract dated 4 October 1568, was to Euphame (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of Sir John Wemyss of that ilk; they had four daughters and four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4717/', "David Carnegie, later first earl of Southesk (1574/5&#150;1658)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67521/', "John Carnegie, later first earl of Northesk (1578/9&#150;1667)")</script>. Carnegie had graduated MA, probably in law, but though he used his legal skills in his private business he only rarely used these officially (an exception being when he was named to the parliamentary commission on law reform in 1578) and he never practised as a professional lawyer.<br>
<br>From 1580 Carnegie was employed by the crown in ecclesiastical affairs and he was king's commissioner to the general assembly which met on 24 April 1583. But it was the experience gained from managing his estates that was particularly exploited by the crown. From 1586 Carnegie was a regular auditor of the exchequer and held other fiscal offices; a privy councillor from 1592, he was a member of more financial commissions than anyone except John Lindsay of Balcarres. Archbishop John Spottiswoode considered that Carnegie was &#145;a wise, peaceable and sober man, in good credit and estimation with the king, and taken into his Privy Council for his skill and knowledge in civil affairs&#146;  (Fraser, 1.59). He was no courtier and, following the death of his second wife on 16 November 1593, married by contract dated 26 April 1594 a woman of relatively humble origins, Janet Henrison (<i>d</i>. in or after 1599), possibly widow of Alexander Guthrie, town clerk of Edinburgh. Following the death of his elder brother, Sir John Carnegie, some time between 7 November 1595 and 13 May 1596, he inherited the family patrimony of Kinnaird.<br>
<br>On 9 January 1596 Carnegie was named as one of the commissioners of a new permanent exchequer with powers of oversight over royal revenues. The commissioners, consisting of six members of the queen's financial council together with John Skene of Curriehill and Carnegie, became known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69937/', "Octavians")</script>, and for two years constituted an effective team. Carnegie's financial acumen was his particular contribution. He died on 19 April 1598 and was buried, as he had wished, at Kinnaird church.<br>
