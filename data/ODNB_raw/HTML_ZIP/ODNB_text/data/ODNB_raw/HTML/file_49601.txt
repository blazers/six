<span class="headword">Carr,  William</span>  (1921&#150;1991), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 1 April 1921 in Workington, Cumberland, the only child of William Carr (1876&#150;1933), a colliery cashier, and his wife, Eleanor Stewart (1880&#150;1933). He was educated at Workington County Technical School. Bill (as he was known to his family and his many friends) was among the finest historians of Germany of his generation. His interest in Germany had been shaped by personal experience of war and subsequent service in the occupation forces. He had fought in France as part of the signals corps and the Royal Artillery before working from July 1945 as part of the team interrogating suspected Nazi war criminals. His deployment in the following months with the field security police at Husum in Schleswig stirred the interest in that region that was to culminate in his first book, <span class="italic">Schleswig-Holstein 1815&#150;1848: a Study in National Conflict</span> (1963). The book emanated from the thesis he had submitted for his PhD, awarded in 1955 at the University of Birmingham, where he had graduated with first-class honours in 1948; he had recommenced in 1947 the studies he had begun in 1939, which were interrupted in 1941 through service with the armed forces.<br>
<br>In fact, Carr's interest in the Schleswig-Holstein question had already borne its first fruits in his undergraduate dissertation, which drew the particular commendation of his tutors. They commented that &#145;Mr. Carr possesses a distinct flair for research and is capable of going on to produce valuable and original work&#146;. The remarks accompanied the successful application that Bill made in 1949 for an assistant lectureship at the University of Sheffield. With his new post, Bill began the career at Sheffield that would eventually lead to a personal chair in 1979, and commenced the loyalty to Sheffield University that lasted until his retirement.<br>
<br>Bill was a popular and effective university teacher, and was in great demand as a speaker at other universities and to audiences of sixth-form pupils, not least because of his extensively used <span class="italic">History of Germany, 1815&#150;1945</span> (1969), which went into a fourth edition months after his death in 1991. Excellent teacher though he was, Bill insisted that the essence of the historian's work was in research and writing, and his own publications form the base of his lasting reputation as a historian. His main interests&#151;in issues of foreign policy and war&#151;found expression in a brief but incisive study of Nazi foreign policy, <span class="italic">Arms, Autarky, and Aggression</span> (1970), an excellent account of the interwoven strategies of Germany, the USA, and Japan in <span class="italic">Poland to Pearl Harbor</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">The Origins of the Wars of German Unification</span> (1991). In tackling such major issues he looked at them afresh, with an independent and original mind. He was open to new approaches and flexible in interpretation. His clarity of thought owed much to the heavy dose of common sense that characterized all his work. His way was invariably to question the obvious or orthodox, to read sources &#145;against the grain&#146;, to reject any notion of outcomes predetermined by impersonal forces, while at the same time to emphasize the structural agencies which influenced individual actions in history. These qualities were especially well reflected in his <span class="italic">Hitler: a Study in Personality and Politics</span> (1978), a work described as &#145;a remarkable synthesis&#146;  (J. Lukacs, <span class="italic">The Hitler of History</span>, 1998, 32). For all its brevity, it remains an outstanding analysis, less a biography than a blend of thematic reflections, full of originality and penetrating insight.<br>
<br>Outside his scholarly career, Bill was actively engaged in public service in his adopted city of Sheffield. He was a member of the national health executive in Sheffield between 1966 and 1971, a member of the city's education committee from 1968 to the early 1980s, chairman of the governors of the city college of education from 1971 to 1976, and chairman of the finance and general purposes committee of Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976 to 1989. In addition, he was a JP in Sheffield from 1969 until his death, and a member (subsequently vice-chairman and chairman) of the board of visitors at Wakefield prison from 1967 until 1991. He was also a committed trade unionist and a lifelong active supporter of the Labour Party: he served as chairman of the Hallam divisional Labour Party between 1959 and 1966. More surprising to those who did not know him well was that, following his conversion to Roman Catholicism at the age of seventeen, he continued to hold strong religious beliefs.<br>
<br>Not least, Bill was a devoted family man. He had met Kathleen Mary (Kate) Williams (1926&#150;2015), then a fellow student (subsequently a teacher), while at Birmingham University. They married on 28 December 1950, and their daughter Mary Louise was born two years later. Bill drew great strength from his family, and rejoiced in the birth of his granddaughter, Eleanor, in 1990. Bill and Kate, an inseparable couple, were generous hosts with an extensive circle of friends, arising in part from his public service and work for Sheffield Labour Party as well as from academic contacts in Britain, America, and Germany. Bill was a cultured man, with interests in art, music, literature, and foreign travel. He was a warm, kind person, full of good humour and good sense, sharp in intellect, generous in feelings, unstinting in support for younger colleagues, loyal in friendship. His northern working-class roots left a lasting mark on his personality and values, as well as on his approach to the past. When given a professorial room&#151;a &#145;F&uuml;hrerzimmer&#146;, as he dubbed it&#151;in the history department at Sheffield, one of his first acts was to remove the picture of Charles I on the wall and replace it with a more ideologically conducive one of his political hero, Aneurin Bevan. He regarded a career in a university lecturing and writing on German history as a privilege and was wont to comment&#151;reminding himself of the privations of his parents' generation&#151;that, whatever its less appealing sides, it was certainly &#145;better than working&#146;.<br>
<br>Bill's growing distinction led inevitably to his promotion to a chair in Sheffield and offers to take up visiting professorships in the USA, which he accepted at Lincoln, Nebraska (1970), the University of Pennsylvania (1972), Salt Lake City, Utah (1983), and New Mexico (1986). He retired from his post at Sheffield University in 1986. Only days before he died Bill heard the news that he had been awarded, for services to German history, the Bundesverdienstkreuz by the president of the Federal Republic of Germany, a fitting tribute to a fine scholar. William Carr died of a coronary thrombosis on 20 June 1991 at his home, 39 Tapton Crescent Road, Sheffield, and was buried on 28 June in Sheffield.<br>
