<span class="headword">Hallward,  Bertrand Leslie</span>  (1901&#150;2003), <span class="occ">classicist, headmaster, and university administrator</span>, was born on 24 May 1901 at 12 Norton Road, Hove, Sussex, the son of Norman Leslie Hallward (<i>d</i>. 1934), a member of the Indian education service, and his wife, Evelyn Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gurdon, the only daughter of Major-General Evelyn Pulteney Gurdon of the Indian army. On his father's side he was descended from the Irish Leslies. He was educated at Warden House, Deal, and Haileybury College, and won a scholarship to his father's college, King's, at Cambridge, which he entered in 1919. Famous for his good looks, with blond hair and Greek statuesque head, he was helped by the fellows of King's: John Sheppard cast him as Apollo in the <span class="italic">Oresteia</span> of Aeschylus; the economist Arthur Pigou pushed him into the Alpine Club, at which his record in Swiss climbs was exceptional; and Frank Adcock pushed his interest into ancient history. He won two first classes and on graduating in 1922 went to the British School in Athens, where he gained a working knowledge of modern Greek. To learn German he spent three months at the University of Vienna. He taught for two terms at Harrow School and then became a fellow of Peterhouse in October 1924. After two years he was a university lecturer and joined a famous team of classicists in contributing to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>. The chapters he wrote on the second and third Punic wars were learned and able. Hannibal became a hero to him. On 2 September 1926 he married (Catherine) Margaret Tait (<i>d</i>. 1991), daughter of Canon Arthur James Tait, the principal of Ridley Hall. The marriage was happy and Cambridge found her enchanting. There were four children, all girls.<br>
<br>In Cambridge Hallward's lectures attracted large classes; a few of his pupils contributed to scholarship in ancient history. He organized a new boathouse and a better sports field, and managed the college garden. He also ran the classical library, and edited the <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span> for four years. Energy went into tennis, hockey, and real tennis. He was restless, intellectually and physically. Better students found him charismatic and inspiring. Others found his exuberance off-putting.<br>
<br>A character such as Hallward could not face sitting long hours to write the history of Rome. He applied for the headmastership of Felsted and was rejected. Cambridge dons were astonished when their young star accepted (in the spring of 1939) the headmastership of Clifton College. On 2 December 1940 bombs hit school buildings. He evacuated the school to Bude on the Cornish coast. This cramped and uncomfortable situation produced academic results. Classics were good, and he acquired a Peterhouse undergraduate not fit for military service, Denis Mack Smith, who proved to be a genius at teaching history. To have a head whom it was impossible to depress kept morale high. Old members looked back upon their years at Bude with an amused gratitude.<br>
<br>The school reopened at Clifton in 1945, by which time Hallward was well known as a headmaster. He applied for the headship of University College, Nottingham, soon to become a university. He was chosen&#151;a scholar with a record of successful administration under difficult conditions and a person of youthful energy and an appearance which no one could find displeasing. The charter of August 1948 named him as the university's first vice-chancellor. A member of staff later said ruefully that a whirlwind had arrived. Students called him Tigger. Each evening he ran round the university lake.<br>
<br>Hallward stayed at Nottingham for sixteen and a half years, until March 1965, by which time it was among the top-ranking universities and looked back on him with gratitude as its creator. He had the advantages of a good city college on which to build, the support of the city, an estate provided by Jesse Boot with room to build and yet retain an attractive campus, governments unusually free with money, and a wife whose company everyone enjoyed. He was determined that the university should be in the first rank in both science and arts. He brimmed with ideas, some impracticable and shot down by council, but some creative. They ranged from the design of academic costume to a plan, not achieved in his time, for a medical school. They were good years for finding first-class professors. Hallward interviewed leading candidates individually and gave them a testing confrontation. If an engineer was to be chosen, his desk was piled with books on engineering. One excellent historian applied for the medieval chair but found the interview too trying and withdrew his application. E. A. Thompson, a communist, became professor of ancient history and established the faculty. Hallward attracted Ivor Keys to be professor of music, Alan Richardson to be professor of theology, Harry Pitt to be professor of mathematics, and Brian Tate to be professor of Spanish. There was awkwardness when a board of electors, gathered after difficulty, were told when they met that the vice-chancellor had already offered someone the chair. He usually got away with high-handedness because the people whom he pushed were in the first rank. He tried to fund a new university library. The money was not there during his time, but when a new library was eventually built it was named after him.<br>
<br>Administrators had a respect for Hallward which sometimes amounted to reverence, and without them he could not have succeeded. They included his secretary, Rosemary David, and the registrar, Alfred Plumb; the chairman of the council, Sir Francis Hill, who pacified vice-chancellor and council when they were in dispute; and above all Sir Keith Murray, chairman of the University Grants Committee. In respect for Hallward, Cecil Cripps and his son Humphrey Cripps funded two new professorships and built a hall of residence. The Cripps foundation offered to build a university chapel on the campus. They were determined that its architecture should be &#145;traditional&#146;. To frustrate the plan, academics who wanted a chapel but by a modern architect combined with opponents who saw no need for a chapel. Hallward's wife was deeply Christian, though his own religion was Platonic philosophy. The plan for a Cripps-funded chapel fell through, but in a small chapel integrated into another building he and his wife paid for the organ, to which he gave up a fifth of his stipend for six years.<br>
<br>The contrast between the university in 1948 and when Hallward retired was striking. He retired a year early, from three motives. He had begun to worry about his wife's health. He knew what he wanted to do, to go back to the Greek and Roman world of the Mediterranean. And he disliked the Robbins report, which recommended expansion of universities. He called it &#145;offering undeserved places to the dimwits of the middle classes&#146;  (Winterbottom, <span class="italic">Hallward</span>, 190). He bought a house at Aldeburgh and had a boat built at Eyemouth for Mediterranean sailing, and for part of the year he gardened and for the other part he sailed from Malta into the islands, after teaching himself navigation. This lasted for ten years until his wife's health failed. In 1980 she had a heart attack and they moved to protected housing at Gretton Court in Cambridge. She died on 1 January 1991. Hallward lived for ten more years, the last in the Cambridge Nursing Centre, 5 High Street, Chesterton, Cambridge, where he died on 17 November 2003, only a few hours after entertaining his two youngest great-grandchildren. He was cremated in Cambridge on 27 November.<br>
