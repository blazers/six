<span class="headword">Boys,  Edward</span>  (1785&#150;1866), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Betshanger, Kent, on 24 January 1785, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3147/', "John Boys (1749&#150;1824)")</script> and his wife, Mary, daughter of the Revd Richard Harvey. After attending King's School, Canterbury (1794&#150;6), where four of his brothers were also pupils, he entered the navy in 1796. He served in the North Sea, on the coast of Ireland, and in the channel, and in June 1802 was appointed to the frigate <i>Phoebe</i>. On 4 August 1803, Boys, when in charge of a prize, was captured by the French, and remained a prisoner of war for six years, until, after many daring and ingenious attempts, he succeeded in escaping. On his return to England he was made lieutenant (effective from 25 May 1809) and served mostly in the West Indies until the peace. On 8 July 1814 he became commander, but, with the post-war naval reduction, he had no further employment afloat, though from 1837 to 1841 he was superintendent of Deal dockyard. On 1 July 1851 he retired with the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Immediately after his escape, and while in the West Indies, Boys wrote for his family an account of his adventures in France; the risk of jeopardizing his French friends made him keep this private, and although abstracts from it had found their way into the papers it was not until 1827 that he was persuaded to publish it, as <span class="italic">Narrative of a Captivity and Adventures in France and Flanders between the Years 1803&#150;9</span>; this was the source from which Captain Marryatt, the author of <span class="italic">Peter Simple</span>, drew much of his account of his hero's escape&#151;more perhaps than from the previously published narrative of the naval officer Henry Ashworth's adventures. Boys also published in 1831 <span class="italic">Remarks on the Practicability and Advantages of a Sandwich or Downs Harbour</span>.<br>
<br>Boys had married Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sayer; they had three sons and three daughters. He died at 14 Blomfield Terrace, Harrow Road, Paddington, London, on 6 June 1866. His second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50434/', "Admiral Henry Boys (1820&#150;1904)")</script>, captain of the <i>Excellent</i> and superintendent of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth, 1869&#150;74, director of naval ordnance from 1874 to 1878, and second in command of the Channel Fleet in 1878&#150;9; after his retirement he served on the board of the Maxim Nordenfelt Gun Company, and as governor of the Marine Society.<br>
