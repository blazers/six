<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lumsden, Sir  James, of Innergellie</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1629&#150;1651), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was a son of Robert Lumsden of Airdrie, Fife; his mother's name is unknown. Two of his brothers, <a href="#cosubject_17187">Robert Lumsden</a> and <a href="#cosubject_17188">William Lumsden [<i>see below</i>]</a>, are known to have become soldiers.<br>
<br>James Lumsden first appears in Swedish service as an ensign in Colonel James Spens's regiment in 1629. He must have proved a skilful soldier; by February 1631 he was a colonel and Field Marshal Gustav Horn specifically requested the use of his 600 infantry for his campaign in northern Germany. Colonel Robert Monro recorded his exploits with Lumsden as they led their pikemen into Frankfurt an der Oder and claimed the town for the Swedes. Lumsden also distinguished himself at the battle of Leipzig in September 1631. The following year the Scottish privy council granted permission for Colonel Lumsden to raise a further 1200 troops for Swedish service. He became the commandant in 1635 of Osnabr&uuml;ck, where eight companies of his regiment were still serving in March 1637.<br>
<br>Lieutenant-General James King called in at Osnabr&uuml;ck in February 1639 and probably passed on the news from Scotland that hostilities were afoot with King Charles I. At this point Lumsden made his first request to be released from Swedish service, with the intention of returning home in order to safeguard not only his property but also his honour. The field marshal, Johan Ban&eacute;r, was, however, not keen to lose his service. Lumsden suggested that his brother Robert could replace him as governor of Osnabr&uuml;ck, but Ban&eacute;r did not consider Robert either capable or qualified for that position. Lumsden continued to seek his release until September 1639, when it was noted that he had been provided with an annual pension, along with Field Marshal Alexander Leslie (later earl of Leven) and Patrick Ruthven (later earl of Forth and of Brentford). The Scottish cleric John Durie informed Sir Thomas Roe, the Stuart agent in Hamburg, that Colonel Lumsden and Colonel David Leslie were travelling to Stockholm to petition the Riksr&aring;d (Swedish state council) for permission to leave Swedish service, and in August 1640 this was finally granted to them. They left Sweden to serve in the covenanting army during the bishops' wars in Scotland. Lumsden and Leslie received not only a pension of 1000 daler for life and a gold chain with Queen Kristina's image on it from the Swedes, but also 200 muskets and 200 suits of armour. Days later another Scot, Lieutenant-Colonel George Monro, received permission to leave, and they decided to depart for Scotland by 1 November from Hamburg. Sir Thomas Roe suggested that the men could be intercepted upon arrival, but most of them got through.<br>
<br>On his return to Scotland, Lumsden bought land at Innergellie in Fife and married Catherine (or Christianne) Rutherford, although it is unknown exactly when this occurred. Of his children, all that is known is that a daughter, Magdalen, later married her first cousin William Erskine. From 1644 until 1649 Lumsden served on various shire committees for the Scottish parliament, representing Fife. He was also an officer in the army of the solemn league and covenant. From 1643 to 1644 he was lieutenant-colonel of Lord Gordon's foot, which became known as Lumsden's foot when he took over from Gordon in 1644. He was at the siege of York in June, when he served alongside Lord Fairfax's troops. Lumsden's plan for the battle of Marston Moor still exists. He was in charge of the reserve Scottish foot, with which he successfully supported the first line of infantry.<br>
<br>Lumsden became the governor of Newcastle upon Tyne on 23 November 1644, although his appointment was ratified by the English only in March 1645. Six companies of Colonel Sinclair's regiment of foot, the Galloway foot, the Mearns and Aberdeen foot, the Merse foot, the Nithsdale and Annandale foot, the Perthshire foot, and Strathearn foot, all came under Lumsden's command at Newcastle. An undated letter signed by William Weems survives in the Swedish archives, referring to Lumsden as the governor at Newcastle and seeking to obtain the remaining balance of Lumsden's pension from Sweden. The Swedish chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, had released 4000 riksdaler for Lumsden in Hamburg, but there were still 2000 riksdaler lacking.<br>
<br>On 30 January 1647 the earl of Leven permitted Lumsden to see Charles I, making him the only noble serving in the army of the solemn league and covenant to do so. Lumsden and his forces left Newcastle later that afternoon, and in February the regiment was disbanded. At some point after this Lumsden must have been knighted, as he is subsequently referred to as &#145;Sir&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1649 Lumsden was colonel of a regiment of foot raised in the presbytery of St Andrews for the army of the covenant. In August 1650 the earl of Loudoun wrote to King Charles II describing Lumsden's loyalty to his cause. David Leslie appointed him lieutenant-general of horse in 1650, and he served as the brigade commander at Dunbar. The regiment was destroyed and both Lumsden and his brother William were taken prisoner. A ship belonging to Sir James Lumsden had been impounded, along with all its contents, at Whitby in January 1651. A month later the English council of state ordered the commissioners of customs to release the ship and make restitution for all the goods as Lumsden had both Cromwell's protection and a pass for the ship. On 10 June 1651 the committee of estates provided Lumsden with maintenance of &pound;240 collected through voluntary contributions for prisoners of war. From the end of February 1652 the English council discussed the release of a Scotsman, Lieutenant-Colonel James Lunden, from captivity. He was to pay &pound;1000 sterling, report to the commander-in-chief, and offer a further &pound;1000 as security for his good behaviour. He was eventually released from English captivity in September 1652. It has not been determined whether this man was the same as James Lumsden. Some sources imply that Lumsden died in 1660, but this has not been verified.<br>
<br>James's brother <a name="cosubject_17187"></a><span class="headword">Robert Lumsden of Montquhanie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, appears to have entered Danish service as a lieutenant-colonel in the regiment of Colonel Donald Mackay (Lord Reay) in 1628. He later served as a colonel in the Green regiment in Swedish service from 1630 to 1632. It is uncertain when he returned to Scotland, but by 1644 Robert was a major-general in the army of the solemn league and covenant under Lord Callander. He also sat on parliamentary war committees in 1647 as Major-General Robert Lumsden of Montquhanie. He was acting as governor of Dundee when General Monck stormed the town, and was killed in the fighting on 1 September 1651.<br>
<br>Another brother, <a name="cosubject_17188"></a><span class="headword">William Lumsden</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1645&#150;1650), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, is believed to have entered Swedish service during the Thirty Years' War, but no proof has yet been found of this. He was probably the Major Lumsdale of the Merse foot in 1643&#150;4, although that officer is listed without a forename. From 1645 to 1647 he served as lieutenant-colonel of the Strathearn foot in the army of the solemn league and covenant. William led the regiment during its campaigns in 1646. He was captured along with his brother James at the battle of Dunbar in 1650. In December of that year he appealed for the payment of his arrears, but nothing further is known of him after this.<br>
