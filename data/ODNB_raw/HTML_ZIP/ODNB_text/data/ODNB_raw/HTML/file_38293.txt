<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Toft,  Albert Arthur</span>  (1862&#150;1949), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 3 June 1862 in Hunters Lane, Handsworth, Birmingham, the son of Charles Toft (1832&#150;1909) and his wife, Rosanna Reeves. He came from a family of Staffordshire pottery artists; his father was Wedgwood's principal modeller from 1876 to 1888, and Albert himself served an apprenticeship there. Toft studied at the government schools of art at Hanley and Newcastle under Lyme, and in 1881 won a scholarship to the National Art Training School (later Royal College of Art), South Kensington. He was one of the earliest of Edward Lant&eacute;ri's long line of outstanding sculpture students, winning silver medals in his second and third years.<br>
<br>Despite receiving offers to return to modelling for pottery, Toft gave priority to sculpture and, in doing so, &#145;passed through lean and trying years &hellip; much might be written concerning his struggles&#146;  (Reddie, 23). His earliest Royal Academy exhibits were reliefs, medallions, and portrait busts, the most important being that of W. E. Gladstone (1888; National Liberal Club, London). Modelled from the life, it was &#145;regarded by the family as his best portrait-bust&#146;  (Hamer, 396). Several ideal sculptures followed, including <span class="italic">Fate Led</span> (1892; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), <span class="italic">Spring</span> (1897; original model purchased for City of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery), and <span class="italic">The Spirit of Contemplation</span> (1901; bronze, 1903, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne). All three portray young nude women and possess characteristic New Sculpture qualities of naturalism in modelling and spiritual reverie in mood.<br>
<br>Commissions followed for commemorative portrait statuary, including monuments to Queen Victoria at Leamington Spa, Nottingham, and South Shields, and to Edward VII at Birmingham and Warwick. Toft's allegorical reliefs are often more impressive than his actual statues. An example is the <span class="italic">Queen Victoria</span> statue (1905; Victoria Embankment, Nottingham), which is described by Susan Beattie as appearing &#145;almost superfluous to the complex fantasy explored below&#146;  (Beattie, 206). The <span class="italic">Charity</span> relief on the pedestal, framed by climbing roses, reflects the influence of Toft's friend Alfred Gilbert. Further major works include the Welsh memorial to the South African War (1910; Cathays Park, Cardiff) and four allegories representing the armed services (1923&#150;4; Centenary Square, Birmingham). They comprise monumental seated bronze figures, which harmoniously complement the nearby Hall of Memory and attest to the vigour of the New Sculpture long after its supposed decline. In his Royal Fusiliers memorial, Holborn (1922; another version, Flers, France), Toft featured an alert soldier, bayonet fixed and ready for action.<br>
<br>Toft's early training in ceramics is indicated in his frequent use of terracotta, whose increasing unfashionableness he regretted. About 1913 he was commissioned to design the Royal Doulton slip-cast figure of W. S. Penley as <span class="italic">Charley's Aunt</span>, a work that reveals his witty versatility. A notable work in yet another medium is Toft's coronation medal of George V and Queen Mary (1911); on the reverse, the dramatic use of lines to denote the ship of state again attests to Gilbert's influence. Although Toft regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy over many years (1885&#150;1947), he was not elected to its membership. This was probably due to the abundance of talented sculptors slightly senior to Toft when his career was at its height. He was, however, elected to the Art-Workers' Guild (1891) and to a fellowship of the Royal Society of British Sculptors (1938). Toft died in a nursing home, at 22 Downview Road, Worthing, Sussex, on 18 December 1949. He was married, and had at least one child, a daughter. His work is represented in the Tate collection; the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; Birmingham City Art Gallery; and the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne. His public statuary is in many cities and towns in England and Wales.<br>
<br>Toft's temperament was described as &#145;warm and genial&#146;  (Reddie, 23), qualities which he displayed towards Gilbert following the latter's resignation from the Royal Academy and bankruptcy. Perhaps Toft's greatest claim to enduring significance is his book <span class="italic">Modelling and Sculpture</span> (1911; reprinted 1949). Less detailed and more accessible to the layman than Lant&eacute;ri's <span class="italic">Modelling</span>, the text is clear and commonsensical, if conservative. In it, Toft celebrates &#145;the renaissance of the sculptor's art in Great Britain&#146;  (Toft, 19) and stresses the significance of Italian Renaissance sculpture and the legacy of Alfred Stevens in bringing this about.<br>
