<span class="headword">Clendining <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Arnold]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was baptized at St Peter's, Stourton, Wiltshire, on 13 January 1767, the daughter of John Arnold (<i>bap</i>. 1746, <i>d</i>. 1774/5) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1785). Her father had been educated as a boy chorister at Salisbury Cathedral and became a vicar-choral at Wells Cathedral in 1768. He was a soloist in Thomas Linley's concerts at Bath, where he was praised by the castrato Ferdinando Tenducci. The family moved to Dublin in 1773 when Arnold became a leading cathedral singer there, but he died less than two years later.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Arnold remained in Dublin with her mother and in 1785 performed as the second chief vocalist at the Rotunda summer concerts, receiving 60 guineas. That year she married William Clendining (<i>d</i>. 1793), an Irish surgeon with landed property in co. Longford, and she then retired from public performance for six years. Her husband's &#145;professional inattention&#146; and &#145;<i>indiscriminate</i> hospitality&#146;  (Haslewood, 2.379) led to his imprisonment in Dublin for debt, and in December 1791 Mrs Clendining went to London with her young family in an attempt to earn money as a professional singer. Despite the help and hospitality of the soprano Elizabeth Billington, whom she had met in Dublin, she failed to obtain singing engagements. She went to Bath, and there the flautist Andrew Ashe, a fellow performer at the Dublin Rotunda, introduced her to the castrato Venanzio Rauzzini, who had become an admired singing teacher and was in charge of the concerts there. After lessons from him, she appeared first at Ashe's benefit concert, and then in Rauzzini's 1792 passion week oratorios. The noblemen and gentlemen of the Bath Catch Club engaged her for their concerts and were the patrons of her benefit on 2 May 1792, at which she raised enough money to release her husband from debtors' prison. Clendining became surgeon of the frigate <i>Inconstant</i> but died at Portsmouth on 27 April 1793.<br>
<br>Mrs Clendining made her first stage appearance at Covent Garden on 3 November 1792, when she played Clara in <span class="italic">Hartford Bridge</span>, a part specially composed for her by William Shield. Her first song was encored, and &#145;the depth and fullness of her middle and lower tones, and the sweetness of the upper ones were acknowledged and admired&#146;  (Haslewood, 2.384). Mrs Clendining sang at Covent Garden for six seasons in English operas, musical afterpieces, and pantomimes. The author of <span class="italic">Candid and Impartial Strictures</span> summed her up as &#145;A sweet singer with a tolerable person, and pleasing countenance&#146;, but added, &#145;The least we say of her acting the better&#146;  (p. 65). On 2 January 1795 she could not appear because she had dislocated her shoulder and collar-bone, but she was performing again before the end of the month. Michael Kelly, who heard her at the Plymouth theatre in summer 1796, noted that she &#145;had a very good voice, and was a favourite with the town, in spite of a most implacable Irish brogue&#146;  (Kelly, 2.123). In summer 1797 she sang with success in Dublin opposite the tenor Charles Incledon. She returned to London that autumn for what proved her final Covent Garden season. Her health was declining, and she made her last appearance at her benefit on 24 May 1798, when her daughter played Little Bob in the afterpiece <span class="italic">The Poor Sailor</span> by John Bernard and Thomas Attwood. Mrs Clendining was engaged at the Edinburgh theatre for winter 1798&#150;9, but illness often prevented her appearing. A charitable gentleman, previously unknown to her, &#145;hearing of her distressed situation, administered every sort of sustenance and medical assistance to her during her illness, and she was buried very decently at his expense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>, 120). She died in Edinburgh on 16 July 1799, and her benefactor is reported to have provided for her two children. <br>
