<span class="headword">O'More,  Owny  MacRory</span> <span class="st"> [Uaithne  MacRuaidhri ua Mordha]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1577, <em>d.</em> 1600), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was born in Gallen, co. Leix (Laois), a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20761/', "Rory Oge O'More (c.1540&#150;1578)")</script>, chieftain and rebel, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1577), daughter of Hugh MacShane O'Byrne, chieftain of the Gabhal Raghnaill branch of the O'Byrne clan, and his first wife, Sadhbh. Owny's career was conditioned by two factors: the government's elimination of his parents and four brothers during Rory Oge's rebellion in 1571&#150;8, and the dismemberment of the O'More lordship and replacement with an English plantation. Owny's career, like his father's, oscillated between pursuing lands within the plantation or securing its overthrow. Beyond the fact that he was raised in Wicklow under the fosterage of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20477/', "Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne (c.1544&#150;1597)")</script>, little is known about Owny's earliest years, save that the government feared him greatly. They believed that the scattered O'Mores were merely &#145;waiting for Rorie Oge's son, who hath already taken in hande weappon, and is of styrring spirit&#146;, before seeking &#145;to kyll and spoyle the present possesors of that whych they take to be theyr right&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/132/8). To forestall this, successive lord deputies attempted to capture Owny, but Fiach MacHugh's protection ensured that he reached maturity safely.<br>
<br>It was not until May 1596, while the government was preoccupied with the Nine Years' War, that Owny made his mark, successfully attacking the Cosbys of Stradbally, Leix. This was an attempt to have his claims to lands within Leix recognized because during the next month he sought pardon, protection, and &#145;to have lande at a reasonable rennt in Gallyn where his preedecesors and hym self werr borne&#146;. The government's indifference persuaded him to escalate the violence. Thereafter, he harassed the settlers so vigorously that &#145;Leix was totally ravaged by him, both its crops, corn and dwellings, so that there was nothing in the territory outside the lock of a gate or a bawn which was not in his power&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1597). These martial endeavours saw a corresponding increase in Owny's standing in Leix and in October 1597 he was described as the &#145;chiefest of the Moores&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/201/22). Whereas he was initially willing to accept the plantation if granted land, his ambitions grew during 1597, perhaps as a result of his understanding with Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone.<br>
<br>The link between Owny and Tyrone was established either through Fiach MacHugh or through Owny's brother Brian Reagh O'More, who served the earl in Ulster. Its terms appear to have been that, in return for military support and inclusion in any peace negotiations, Owny would open a front against the government in Leinster. Thereafter, Owny frequently received mercenaries and munitions from Tyrone, which he used to wreak havoc in Leinster and increase his regional influence: his assistance to junior branches of the Butler family who sought to escape the authority of Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, dates from this time. After 1597 Owny was the means by which men like Edmund Butler, second Viscount Mountgarret, sought Tyrone's favour in Leinster.<br>
<br>Tyrone's support allowed Owny to transform his strategy. Rather than just waging a guerrilla campaign like his father, he was capable of engaging substantial English contingents in the field, as he illustrated in December 1597 when he decimated two English companies near Maryborough Fort, Leix. In September 1598 he attacked a relief column of &#145;twenty-four companies of foot and two hundred horse&#146;, led by Ormond and bound for Maryborough Fort. In this engagement Ormond &#145;lost more than the value of the provisions in men, horses, and arms&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1598). Immediately after this success Owny, on Tyrone's orders, marched into Munster at the head of 2000 men. He established Tyrone's nominee, James Fitzgerald, as fifteenth earl of Desmond and destroyed the Munster plantation.<br>
<br>Owny's reputation as &#145;a gentleman [skilled] in the arts of war&#146; was well established and enhanced further by his attack on Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, the lord lieutenant, at the Pass of the Plumes (Bearna na gCleti) in May 1599. As Essex marched south through Leix with 7000 foot and 900 horse he discovered Owny's forces behind prepared ground. In the ensuing battle Owny's men &#145;made fierce and desperate assaults, and furious, irresistible onsets on him [Essex], in intricate ways and narrow passes, in which both parties came in collision with each other, so that great numbers of the Earl's people were cut off&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1597, 1599). This engagement exacerbated the lord lieutenant's difficulties, coming as it did at the same time as Fiach MacHugh's great victory at Deputy's Pass near Wicklow on 29 May.<br>
<br>Owny had been a thorn in the English administration's side since 1596, but his influence was mainly based on support from Ulster. His survival was due to the fact that the government's army was constantly preoccupied elsewhere until 1600. He might have survived until the end of the war but for his most famous and ill-advised exploit&#151;capturing Elizabeth I's Irish favourite, Ormond, in April 1600&#151;which marked him out for elimination. Ormond's abduction caused considerable consternation in certain government circles because it was feared that &#145;therle wilbe passed over by Owny McRory to the traitor Tyrone&#146;. However, Sir Geoffrey Fenton informed Sir Robert Cecil, the principal secretary, that he believed Owny would &#145;reserve him in his owne possession, to thend to make his deliverie proffitable to hymself&#146;. Others wondered &#145;how farr this sodden trecherous action might alter some of the Butlers&#146;. Owny initially planned to use Ormond as a bargaining tool to get Leix and Offaly restored to the O'Mores and the O'Connors but he was forced to abandon this course when it became apparent that many of his allies and supporters sought to dissociate themselves from the earl's abduction. The predictions by Fenton and Sir George Carew that Ormond's captivity would create breaches among Owny's supporters proved correct. Forced to move Ormond &#145;every night from one cabin to another&#146;, Owny appeared at a loss as to how best to use his prisoner. The rumour that the queen resolved to send large numbers of soldiers into the midlands to find Ormond &#145;brede such alteration in most of the Irishry&#146; that they swore &#145;to be at open deffiance with him [Owny]&#146;. Consequently, Owny was forced to release Ormond early in June.<br>
<br>With Ormond's liberation the new lord deputy, Charles Blount, eighth Baron Mountjoy, could move safely against Owny. On 15 August 1600 his forces began to ravage Leix, cutting down the ripening wheat and laying waste to the country. Recognizing that Mountjoy was uninterested in concession, Owny engaged the government's forces on 17 August in the Douglas valley in &#145;an overwhelming and fierce battle&#146;, during which he was fatally wounded  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1600). Fearing that Mountjoy would display Owny's head on Dublin Castle, Owny &#145;wyled it to be cutt of after his death and burried&#146;. Mountjoy continued his policy of killing and displacing the O'Mores and the O'Connors until mid-1601, when the midlands had been pacified.<br>
<br>Owny's death and Mountjoy's elimination of his followers meant that all the leading O'Mores were removed from Leix and finally ended the resistance of the sept or clan to the plantation scheme. The Gaelic lordship of Leix was shattered, ensuring that the planter community could return and face the seventeenth century with a reasonable degree of confidence&#151;a fact not lost on the annalists, who bitterly lamented the death of &#145;an illustrious, renowned and celebrated gentleman&#146;, who:<blockquote>had wrested the government of his patrimony, by the prowess of his hand and the resoluteness of his heart, from the hands of foreigners &hellip; until he brought it under his own sway and jurisdiction, and under the government of his stewards and bonnaghts, according to Irish usage. (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1600)</blockquote>
