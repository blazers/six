<span class="headword">Brackenbury,  Charles Booth</span>  (1831&#150;1890), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Bayswater, London, on 7 November 1831, was the third son of William Brackenbury (<i>d</i>. 1844), lieutenant, 61st foot (1809&#150;16), of Aswardby, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Maria (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1798), daughter of James Atkinson of Newry, co. Down, and widow of James L. Wallace. He belonged to an old Lincolnshire family, well represented in nearly all the nineteenth-century British wars. William Brackenbury served in the same regiment as his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3160/', "Sir Edward Brackenbury (1785&#150;1864)")</script>, and was wounded at Talavera and Salamanca. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32021/', "Sir Henry Brackenbury (1837&#150;1914)")</script> was Charles Brackenbury's brother.<br>
<br>Charles Brackenbury obtained a cadetship at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on 8 July 1847, was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 19 December 1850, and became lieutenant on 27 September 1852. He served in the Crimea from June 1855, with the chestnut troop of the horse artillery. Having been promoted second captain on 17 November 1857, he was sent to Malta. In March 1860 he was appointed assistant instructor in artillery at the Royal Military Academy, and in February 1864 assistant director of artillery studies at Woolwich. He became first captain on 9 February 1865, and was a boundary commissioner under the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>.<br>
<br>During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 Brackenbury was the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent with the Austrian army, and was at the battle of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz (Sadowa)&#151;riding with Benedek under fire at Chlum&#151;and reported the naval battle of Lissa. He was the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent in the Franco-Prussian War, accompanying Prince Frederick Charles in the Le Mans campaign; and in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, when he crossed the Balkans with Count Gourko.<br>
<br>Brackenbury became regimental major on 5 July 1872, and lieutenant-colonel on 15 January 1876. In September 1873 he was attached to the recently established intelligence branch of the War Office, as acting deputy assistant adjutant-general then deputy assistant adjutant-general (April 1874 to March 1876). In 1875 he lectured at the Royal United Service Institution on &#145;The intelligence duties of the staff abroad and at home&#146;, showing the disparity in size between the intelligence branch and continental staffs, and calling for upgrading and enlargement of the former. From April 1876 to June 1880 he was superintending officer of garrison instruction at Aldershot, and from July 1880 to June 1885 superintendent of the gunpowder factory at Waltham Abbey, Essex. He was promoted colonel in the army on 15 January 1881, and in the regiment on 1 October 1882. He commanded the artillery in the south-eastern district, as colonel on the staff, from 8 May 1886 until 2 June 1887, when he was appointed director of artillery studies at Woolwich. His title was changed on 1 October 1889 to &#145;director of the artillery college&#146;, and he was given the temporary rank of major-general.<br>
<br>On 6 April 1854 Brackenbury married Hilda Eliza (1832&#150;1918), daughter of Archibald Campbell of Quebec, her majesty's notary, and they had six sons and three daughters, including the portrait painter and suffrage campaigner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56221/', "Georgina Agnes Brackenbury")</script>. Two sons joined the Indian staff corps, and died in India&#151;Charles Herbert, of typhoid fever contracted in the Bolan Pass in 1885; Lionel Wilhelm, killed at Manipur in 1891.<br>
<br>Unlike many officers Brackenbury had no Indian service or colonial war experience, but he had witnessed continental great-power war. Impressed and influenced by the Prussian army, he became one of the &#145;Prussophile&#146;, &#145;continentalist&#146; school in Britain, ignoring the American Civil War and urging copying from the Prussians, including replacement of line formation by &#145;swarm&#146;. He advocated continental offensive doctrine and criticized preoccupation with minimizing losses, claiming &#145;the side which has the greatest moral force wins&#146;  (Bailes, 103). Like other continentalists he became quite rigid in his views. He urged army reform and innovation including tactical change, large-scale manoeuvres, Royal Artillery higher education, and a general staff with a chief of staff. In the early 1870s he advocated machine guns, and in 1878 he advocated iron shields (separate from the gun, not attached as was later the case) to protect field artillery gunners from infantry fire and shrapnel. In the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> he warned against military unpreparedness and the danger of invasion.<br>
<br>Wanting to increase pressure for army reform, Brackenbury after 1884 became friendly with Spenser Wilkinson and they discussed military issues. Brackenbury criticized Wolseley and the duke of Cambridge, and urged Wilkinson to demand a chief of staff and army organization ready for war. Wilkinson later described Brackenbury as &#145;one of the most accomplished officers of the progressive school, a master of his profession and a clear exponent of its principles&#146;  (Gwynn and Tuckwell, 2.389). Sir Charles Dilke, following the collapse of his career with the 1885 Crawford divorce scandal, took up the cause of army reform and cultivated senior officers, seeking expertise. He contacted Brackenbury, who from 1887 advised and assisted him with his articles and books on defence including <span class="italic">The Present Position of European Politics</span> (1887), <span class="italic">The British Army</span> (1888)&#151;Dilke wrote in his unpublished memoirs of the articles from which he compiled the books, &#145;the first two &hellip; were entirely from my hand, whereas the others of that series were largely Charles Brackenbury's&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 43941)&#151;and <span class="italic">Problems of Greater Britain</span> (1890); these works publicized British defence inadequacies and demanded reform. As Brackenbury was on the active list his role was not disclosed: he wrote to Dilke, &#145;I am obliged to maintain a strict incognito&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 43913, fols. 204&#150;5). Brackenbury was also a friend of George Meredith and discussed military issues with him.<br>
<br>Brackenbury's main publications were <span class="italic">European Armaments in 1867</span> (based on articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in 1867)&#151;mostly on ordnance, and including his assessment of the Gatling gun, <span class="italic">The Constitutional Forces of Great Britain</span> (1869), <span class="italic">Foreign Armies and Home Reserves</span> (from <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1871), <span class="italic">Frederick the Great</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">Field-Works: their Technical Construction and Tactical Application</span> (1888), in a series of military handbooks he edited. His contributions to the <span class="italic">United Service Institution Journal</span> (vols. 15&#150;28) included papers on &#145;The military systems of France and Prussia in 1870&#146; (15), &#145;The winter campaign of Prince Frederick Charles, 1870&#150;71&#146; (15), &#145;The intelligence duties of the staff&#146; (19), and &#145;The latest development of the tactics of the three arms&#146; (27.439). He frequently contributed to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and once to the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>.<br>
<br>Brackenbury's cousin Edward Brackenbury (1848&#150;1907), Royal Artillery, in 1870 married Emilie (&#145;Mimi&#146;) Shaw, sister of Flora Shaw (1852&#150;1929). Brackenbury's wife disliked housekeeping and found her children rather burdensome, and in the late 1870s and early 1880s Flora Shaw lived with Brackenbury's family at Aldershot and Waltham Abbey in the role of housekeeper&#150;governess. She became a quasi-filial close friend of Brackenbury, consulting him on her problems, and in the later 1880s he used his contacts, including Spenser Wilkinson&#151;to whom he described her in 1889 as &#145;not only clever, but graceful and womanly&#146;  (Spenser Wilkinson MSS, 9011-42-133-17)&#151;to try to advance her career in journalism.<br>
<br>In February 1890, following overwork, Brackenbury fainted in the street in Woolwich and &#145;went down to a zero of strength&#146;  (Spenser Wilkinson MSS, 9011-42-133-20). Following convalescence, he resumed his duties. Returning from his work at Woolwich to his home in Chelsea, he died suddenly on 20 June 1890 in a first-class railway carriage, between Maze Hill and London Bridge, following a heart attack, and was buried with military honours at Plumstead cemetery, Woolwich. His widow, Hilda Brackenbury, and two daughters, Georgina Brackenbury and Marie Brackenbury, became prominent suffragettes in the early twentieth century.<br>
