<span class="headword">Lyle <span class="st"> [Lile]</span>,  Agnes</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1825), <span class="occ">ballad singer</span>, was the daughter of a &#145;customary&#146; weaver from Locherlip who was born <i>c</i>.1731 and died <i>c</i>.1811, and from whom she learned her songs. She was residing in Kilbarchan, 5&frac12; miles east of Paisley, Renfrewshire, in 1825.<br>
<br>Firsthand knowledge of Agnes Lyle comes from manuscript sources made by William Motherwell (1797&#150;1835), poet, journalist, writer, and ballad collector and editor. In the early 1820s he entered into a collaborative project, which soon became his alone, to produce a book titled <span class="italic">Minstrelsy: Ancient and Modern</span> (published in fascicles whose parts were gathered together in 1827). He read books, corresponded with experts, and engaged in field collecting. And he seems to have had particular success collecting materials from women and even identified in a manuscript notebook (Harvard U., Houghton L., MS 25242.16) a group designated &#145;old singing women&#146;. Agnes Lyle, or Lile, as he sometimes wrote her name, was one of these women. She was probably then in her fifties, he in his twenties, so she seemed old to him, as did her Kilbarchan neighbours whose songs he also recorded: Mrs King, Mrs Thomson, Nancy Holmes, and Agnes Laird.<br>
<br>Motherwell's collecting notebook (Harvard U., Houghton L., MS 25242.16, copy made for Francis James Child), where he wrote reminders and notes to himself, and the manuscript which offers fair copies of materials gathered by collecting and correspondence (University of Glasgow, Murray MS 501) suggest that he made three visits to Agnes Lyle, probably in the late summer and autumn of 1825. In total, he may have collected as many as thirty-two items of which twenty-one are full texts; he paid her for her help. He mentioned her in a letter to C. K. Sharpe  (Harvard U., Houghton L., MS 25241.56F), commenting that she wept in the process of singing &#145;Sheath and Knife&#146;, a tale of incest and death. In addition to locating the source of her repertoire&#151;her father&#151;Motherwell also includes comments made by Lyle:<blockquote>I was informed by A. Lile that she has heard a longer set of the ballad [&#145;Lord Jamie Douglas&#146;] in which while Lady Douglas is continuing her lament she observes a troop of gentlemen coming to her father's and she expresses a wish that these should be sent by her lord to bring her home. They happen to be sent for that purpose and she accompanies them. On her meeting however with her lord &hellip; her heart breaks and she drops down dead-at-his feet.</blockquote>Francis James Child, the great nineteenth-century American editor of balladry, recovered Motherwell's manuscripts and printed texts in his five-volume work (<span class="italic">English and Scottish Popular Ballads</span>, 1882&#150;98); most of Lyle's full texts are given there and attributed to her. That publication brought Agnes Lyle's name to public view and set the stage for an analysis of her repertory  (McCarthy).<br>
<br>In the introduction to his <span class="italic">Minstrelsy</span>, Motherwell had described a method of generating texts built on commonplaces which suggests something like oral formulaic composition  (Lord). It may be that this was a technique he observed in the singing and song production of Agnes Lyle, a technique analysed from internal textual evidence alone by McCarthy who also suggests that her repertoire represents her radical political leanings resulting from the depressed situation for the weaving community in the early part of the nineteenth century. Yet her songs also present an array of strong, active women, who love despite all the obstacles. This may well reflect her own hopes.<br>
