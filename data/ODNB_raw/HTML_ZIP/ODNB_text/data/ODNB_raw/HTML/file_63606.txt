<span class="headword">Day,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1758?, <em>d.</em> 1832), <span class="occ">lawyer and proposer of reforms</span>, was probably baptized on 19 April 1758 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the son of Joseph Day, attorney, and his wife, Mary. He was articled at the age of about fourteen to his father who then resided in the parish of St Mary-le-Bow in the City of London. Admitted an attorney of the king's bench in 1781, Day was living in Great Bath Street in 1784, but moved during the 1790s and early 1800s, first to Hatton Street, then to Kirby Street, and later still to 66 Lamb's Conduit Street, London.<br>
<br>Little is known of Day's legal practice except that it was secondary to a lifelong, but unsuccessful, devotion to the invention for profit of minor reforms in government. Starting in 1788, when he communicated to the Treasury a scheme for raising revenue by levying stamp duties on probate records, Day tirelessly sought audiences with important people, including the king and the prince of Wales, and on several occasions advertised his ideas by printing pamphlets at his own expense.<br>
<br>Day's most notable project, a plan canvassed during the mid-1790s for reforming the qualifying process for attorneys and solicitors, was in broad outline, and in many of its particulars, an anticipation by more than twenty-five years of the Incorporated Law Society. Arguing that the low reputation of the profession was caused by the failure of the existing system of articled clerkship to guarantee that men of bad character and inadequate training were being excluded from practice, Day proposed that a college of attorneys, under the supervision of the judges, should be established by statute and given the power to examine candidates for admission while serving as a selective society of &eacute;lite practitioners. Some sixty London attorneys subscribed to the project, and Day was encouraged by interviews he had with the judges and government officials. Although not himself a member, he also consulted with the governing body of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers, the leading club of London attorneys; but, while Day had probably exaggerated from the outset the support he enjoyed, the plan was killed in 1795 when the society turned against it without putting it before its full membership. Fears that the new society would lead to higher taxation, and concern over the role Day saw himself playing in it, were the likely causes of failure, and indeed Day did turn again in 1797 to the creation of new levies on the profession (probably connected with 37 Geo. III c. 90). Then, during the food crisis at the end of the century, he worked on a plan for creating a national inspectorate to survey the available grain stock. His point was that government regulation of the corn trade should be based on accurate information about supply, rather than on the dubious evidence of reported prices, but, although he spoke to government ministers and was invited in early 1802 to appear before London's committee on the high price of provisions, he gained nothing.<br>
<br>Day's last known project, which originated in 1807, was a scheme for improving public access to the information recorded in parish registers by setting up offices in London and York where the records would be made available for consultation and, though it was somewhat more limited in scope than Day's proposal, George Rose steered a bill along these lines through parliament in 1812 (52 Geo. III c. 146). By then suffering severe financial difficulties, Day hoped that a government post arising from the scheme would save him from ruin. Having at some earlier point moved his family from London to Macclesfield, in 1811 he gave up his practice in Cheshire and took accommodation in Frith Street, Soho, London, but his expectations were bitterly disappointed when Rose informed him that no office would be forthcoming. Something of a visionary, and always proud of his service to government and the public, Day's projects evidently left him a broken man. He is last heard from in 1825, when he wrote to Sir Robert Peel from Maldon, Essex, once again begging some reward for all of his past services. He died in 1832.<br>
