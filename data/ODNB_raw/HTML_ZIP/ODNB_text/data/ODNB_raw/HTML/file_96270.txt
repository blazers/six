<span class="headword">Woodrow,  Joash</span>  (1927&#150;2006), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Leeds Maternity Hospital on 6 April 1927, the fifth of seven children of Harry Woodrow (formerly Herzl Wiadrow) and his wife, Rebecca (formerly Rifka), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brostoff, who were both of Jewish descent, born in Russian Poland; his birth certificate recorded his name as Jehoash. Woodrow's parents had each come to Leeds with their own parents in the early 1900s. They married on a long visit to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1911, and returned to live in Leeds the following year.<br>
<br>Until 1932 the Woodrow family lived at 53 Chapeltown Road in Leeds. On the ground floor, the studious Harry opened a bookshop, which, however, did not prosper. He was therefore forced to return to work as a tailor's machinist, at the Leeds factory of Montague Burton, though the family was able to move to a large house, also in the Chapeltown area.<br>
<br>As a small boy Woodrow showed an artistic streak, making immaculate cardboard copies of board games that his family was unable to afford. In a small gouache painting of about 1945 showing a homburg-hatted male figure (a memory of his father) peering into a shop window of a sooty Victorian building, <span class="italic">Mr Woodrow's Bookshop</span>, Woodrow recalled his early childhood milieu. From 1942 to 1945 he was a student at Leeds College of Art. During this period&#151;like members of an earlier generation of English Jewish artists, notably Isaac Rosenberg and Mark Gertler in London's East End, and the Ukrainian-born painter Jacob Kramer in Leeds&#151;Woodrow made compassionate studies of his careworn immigrant parents, usually showing his father reading, and his mother resting or sleeping. His father died in 1951, his mother ten years later.<br>
<br>From 1945 to 1948 Woodrow did two years' national service, working mostly as a cartographer in a Cairo office. He then returned to Leeds College of Art to complete his studies. A fellow student there, Jack Coulthard, recalled him as &#145;an exotic and quite cosmopolitan figure&#146; who &#145;read Sartre and Kafka, and was very interested in Matisse and Picasso&#146;; he was &#145;warm, charismatic&#146; yet &#145;somehow vulnerable, delicate&#146;  (Vann and Wullschlager, 26). From 1950 to 1953 he attended the Royal College of Art in London on a scholarship. The artist Cyril Satorsky, who attended art college in Leeds and London with Woodrow, recalled him as a young man as &#145;under average height, thickly built, square-faced with a very Russian-looking face. He had a Yorkshire accent but not a broad one. He was extremely shy and ultra-sensitive&#146;  (ibid., 23). This shyness and ultra-sensitivity meant that throughout his adult life Woodrow hardly ever revealed anything about his personal emotions to friends and family. It is not known if he had any romantic associations or attractions.<br>
<br>On graduating, Woodrow received glowing testimonials from his teachers. Ruskin Spear wrote, &#145;He shows great enthusiasm, intensity and ability&#146;  (Vann and Wullschlager, 28); Rodrigo Moynihan noted his paintings' &#145;mature richness of colour and expression&#146;  (ibid.), and Carel Weight, while noting his &#145;distinct sense of humour&#146;, saw him as &#145;a young artist of marked originality&#146;  (ibid.). His paintings of city parks and streets dating from the 1950s are remarkable for their painterly intensity and disciplined spontaneity of mark-making. Satorsky later described Woodrow's radical approach: &#145;it was as though he was defying the brush&#151;there'd be paint on bristles sticking out in all directions &hellip; what looks like a careless brushstroke reveals the deepest consideration&#146;  (ibid., 27).<br>
<br>Woodrow stayed on in London for a while after leaving the Royal College of Art, but suffered a nervous crisis and returned to Leeds. In 1955 the Woodrow family moved to a small new semi-detached house in Allerton Grange Gardens, Leeds. The household now consisted of Rebecca, her son Israel, her nephew Paul (who was born in 1940), and Joash. Paul and Joash enjoyed one escape from post-war Leodensian austerity in a mid-1950s trip by train to Paris, where they visited art galleries and sat in fashionable left bank caf&eacute;s. This was Woodrow's only post-war trip abroad. There was also a 1960 visit to London with Paul, where the Picasso exhibition at the Tate greatly impressed him.<br>
<br>Following Woodrow's mother's death, the family home began to fill up with artworks. Furniture was moved to make space for paintings; walls were so densely multi-layered with canvases that it became difficult to pass. Over the next four decades, living in relative seclusion and supported by modest stipends from two elder brothers and, latterly, his state pension, Woodrow painted and drew prolifically. He also made bizarrely inventive assemblages and, in the early 1960s, decorated a series of Victorian art books with his own hilariously surreal interventions. His late 1950s and 1960s portraits of handsome young men, rabbis, Leeds businessmen, and both stylish and sometimes somewhat grotesque-looking women, show a gracefully expressive use of line. Dozens of notebooks detail acute observations of Leeds city streets, its impressive Victorian architecture, its pedestrians and buskers, as well as succinct, dynamic studies of the Yorkshire countryside and coast.<br>
<br>Woodrow's most considerable achievement was the large body of paintings he made of Leeds from the early 1960s until about 1995. City centre panoramas, and semi-industrial sites around town, are the subjects of tautly structured, richly impastoed, shimmering oils. Inspiration was almost literally on his doorstep in the form of the local Gledhow Valley allotments, whose derelict huts, white picket fences, trees, and flowers were portrayed with a jousting use of line and a diaphanous palette. There is a poignant affinity between the appearance of Woodrow's allotments, with their huts, fences and muddy tracks, and the tragically extinguished world of the shtetls and towns of Jewish Poland, where his parents had come from.<br>
<br>For over forty years Woodrow painted in Leeds with astonishing perseverance and dedication, free from public scrutiny. Not having to exhibit his works or having to compromise to the demands of critics or dealers, he enjoyed extraordinary inner freedom. In 2000 he left Leeds to live in sheltered accommodation in Manchester, and never painted again. The first solo exhibition of his work, at 108 Fine Art Gallery, Harrogate, drew a remarkable degree of press attention and critical acclaim. In August 2005 his brother Saul took him to see the first retrospective exhibition of his paintings, held at Manchester Art Gallery, the first time he had seen his work on public display. Further exhibitions at the Ben Uri Gallery and the Royal College of Art the same year drew critical acclaim. He died at North Manchester General Hospital on 15 February 2006, of a bowel obstruction.<br>
