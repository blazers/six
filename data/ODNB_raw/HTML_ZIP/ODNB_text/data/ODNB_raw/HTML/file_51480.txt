<span class="headword">Wilson,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Joe]</span></span>  (1841&#150;1875), <span class="occ">songwriter and performer</span>, was born at 49 Stowell Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 29 November 1841. He and his younger twin brother, Thomas, were the children of Joseph Wilson (1816&#150;1844), joiner, and his wife, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1816). Joe, as he was called, would say that his parents were &#145;byeth natives o' the canny aud toon o' Newcassil&#146; (<span class="italic">Tyneside Songs and Drolleries</span>, xvii), but the 1841 census appears to give his father's birthplace as Ireland. In 1851 his sister Ann was working as a milliner, aged seventeen, and his elder brother John was apprenticed as a brass finisher, aged fourteen, while Joe and Tom were scholars at St Andrew's church school. In 1862 they set up in business together with a small printer's shop in Marlborough Crescent. In December 1864 Joe made his professional d&eacute;but at Pelton, a pit village in the heart of the Durham coalfield, and by the end of 1865 he was appearing regularly at the best venues in Newcastle&#151;the Tyne and the Oxford&#151;and touring the northern and Tyneside circuit of music halls, clubs, pubs, and &#145;free-and easies&#146;. Wilson's first printed songs had been third-rate poesy (&#145;Dear brother Tom, our birthday's come&#146;) but now he switched to dialect and real life. He also did &#145;drolleries&#146;&#151;a sort of stand-up comedy, although in Joe's case when not performing he preferred to be sitting down. Never in good health, and with infirmity in his legs, the time-served printer minded his press from a special seat. Joe would make his workmates weep so hard with laughter that at tea breaks some refused to sit with him.<br>
<br>By the time of his marriage to Isabella English (<i>b</i>. 1849) of Jarrow on 3 August 1869 Joe Wilson was the star of northern music hall. He sang his own songs to mainly Irish melodies (in 1873 he promised a new song with every engagement), his voice being described as a &#145;gentle, thin tenor&#146; (<span class="italic">Newcastle Daily Chronicle</span>, 26 Dec 1891). It is true that he had joined a long line of Tyneside singers and song writers, and it is true that he was a lucky entertainer in the sense that the two established stars of the circuit (George Ridley and Ned Corvan) died shortly before and after his stage d&eacute;but, but it is indubitably the case that Wilson brought new life and vigour to the halls. He did not play the clown, nor did he exploit the viler aspects of club room banter. Instead he stood in everyday clothes and told of the trials and comforts of the people. Most of his songs were specific to north-east England, many were funny, and a good few were sentimental, but all of them took working-class life and bathed it in the limelight of his own indomitable good sense.<br>
<br>Born in a street with a lead works at the back and a fever hospital at one end, Wilson knew what he sang about. The census shows that the neighbours down below were not posh. When he was nine his father was dead and his mother and sister were struggling to bring up the family on the pittances of millinery and straw-bonnet making. He died in a house that faced the engine sheds of Newcastle central station. Wilson wrote where he stood, and the dialect was vital to the humour: <span class="italic">Keep Yor Feet Still Geordie Hinney</span> (George, please keep still in bed); <span class="italic">Dinnet Clash the Door</span> (young persons, shut the door quietly); <span class="italic">Maw Bonnie Gyetside Lass</span> (I appear to have trodden on your dress); and <span class="italic">Aw Wish Your Muther Wad Come</span> (the consequences of men holding babies):<blockquote>
<div>Cum, Geordy, haud the bairn,<br>
</div>
<div>Aw's sure aw'll not stop lang,<br>
</div>
<div>Aw'd tyek the jewel mesel,<br>
</div>
<div>But really aw's not strang.<br>
</div>
<div>Thor's floor and coals te get,<br>
</div>
<div>The hoose-turns thor not deun:<br>
</div>
<div>So haud the bairn for fairs,<br>
</div>
<div>Ye've often deund for fun!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In 1871 Joe took the Adelaide Hotel in New Bridge Street. This was not a success. He returned to the stage the following year but this time as a fully pledged Good Templar, extolling temperance and the amelioration of the people. In 1873 he went back on circuit but in the summer of 1874 he was taken ill in Glasgow and his health went into rapid decline. He knew about tuberculosis; his father had died of it. He said he'd &#145;like to see me children reared &hellip; I should like to pull through&#146; (<span class="italic">Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</span>, 21 March 1914) but early in September the first of two benefits was held for Isabella and the three children. Joe Wilson died from phthisis on 14 February 1875 at 47 Railway Street, Elswick, and was buried on 17 February at the old cemetery, Jesmond. The local newspapers ran short obituaries.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Joe Lives</span> was the title of a Tyneside Theatre production by Alex Glasgow and John Woodvine in 1971. Joe has certainly not been forgotten. In 1869 the Newcastle booksellers Thomas and George Allan gained copyright over his songs. As a printer Joe had always been able to publish his own penny numbers but now his works found their way into wider and richer markets, including collector's editions. At the same time, a cultural coalition of &#145;new Northumbrians&#146;&#151;liberal intellectuals intent on a new popular identity for the region&#151;found in him a Tyneside Robbie Burns. Some twenty years after his death Joe Wilson's star shone bright again in books and compilations, in Joseph Cowen's newspapers, in Ralph Hedley's paintings, and in the adult education campaigns of Robert Spence Watson's Literary and Philosophical Society, where his songs were hailed as ballads in a great tradition of Northumbrian balladry starting with Caedmon. After 1918 Catcheside-Warrington's piano song books took him into front room sing-songs. After 1945 a second regional revival spearheaded by another left-of-centre cultural coalition, this time in TV and radio, found that Joe's songs still made their mark. The people had changed less than post-war affluence suggested. More than any other person Joe Wilson showed the Geordies their best side: brave, sporting, sentimental, generous, and as daft as a brush.<br>
