<span class="headword">Kinneir, Sir  John Macdonald</span>  (1782&#150;1830), <span class="occ">army officer, traveller, and diplomatist</span>, born at Carnden, Linlithgow, on 3 February 1782, was the illegitimate son of John Macdonald, comptroller of customs at Bo'ness, and Mrs Cecilia Maria Kinneir. In 1802 he was nominated to a cadetship by Sir William Bensley, under the name of Macdonald, which he retained in the Indian army lists up to his death. On 21 September 1804 he was appointed ensign in the Madras native infantry, but was not posted until the formation of the 24th (out of the 1st) Madras native infantry on 1 January 1807, when he joined the new regiment as lieutenant. He became captain in the same regiment on 14 April 1818, and afterwards attained the army rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel. For some time he was secretary to the officer commanding in Malabar and Kanara. He was attached to Sir John Malcolm's mission in Persia in 1808&#150;9, during part of which time he was supernumerary agent at Bushehr, and made numerous journeys in Persia. On the breaking up of the mission in 1810 Macdonald travelled from Baghdad, by way of Mosul and Diyarbak&#305;r, to Constantinople, visited Manisa and Smyrna, and returned to England through Spain and Portugal.<br>
<br>Ordered to rejoin his regiment, Macdonald started for Stockholm in January 1813 with Colonel Neil Campbell, one of the military commissioners sent to northern Europe, intending to reach India through Russia and Persia. The French retreat from Moscow having left open a more southerly route, he accompanied Campbell from Stockholm to the tsar's headquarters at Kilisch in Poland, and went through Austria and Hungary to Constantinople. After visiting Asia Minor and Cyprus he returned to Constantinople, and from there travelled to Baghdad and Bombay. He published a <span class="italic">Narrative of travels in Asia Minor, Armenia, and Kurdistan in 1813&#150;14, with remarks on the marches of Alexander the Great and of the ten thousand Greeks</span> (1818). From the title-page it appears that he had at that time taken his mother's surname of Kinneir, although there is no record in the India Office of his change of name. After 1813 he was for some years town-major of Fort St George, Madras, and resident to the nawab of the Carnatic.<br>
<br>In 1823&#150;4 it was proposed to withdraw the charg&eacute; d'affaires who had represented British interests at Tehran since 1815, and to replace him as before by an East India Company's envoy. The shah, Futteh Ali, consented reluctantly, and Kinneir was appointed envoy in 1824. He arrived at the shah's camp at Ahar in September 1826 to find the Persians engaged in active hostilities with the Russians. Futteh Ali claimed the British subsidy to which, by treaty, Persia was entitled if attacked by a European power. Kinneir would not agree to this, as Persia had been the aggressor. Extensive military operations followed, during which Kinneir was present with the Persian army. On 19 October 1827 the frontier fortress of Erivan was stormed by Prince Paskevich's troops and a Russian division was pushed on to Tabriz. The shah's chief minister, Ali Yar Khan, deserted him on the approach of the Russians, and fled with Kinneir, who ably did his utmost to bring about a peace. The Russians, though declining to admit his official character, gratefully accepted his mediation in a private capacity. A treaty of peace was signed at Turkmanchai on 23 February 1828, involving loss of territory to Persia and the loss of the influence previously enjoyed by the British mission. No blame has been attributed to Kinneir, who won the respect of both Persians and Russians. He received the Persian order of the Sun and Lion, and on 17 November 1829 was knighted (as Sir John Macdonald).<br>
<br>In 1825 Kinneir had married Amelia Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1860), third daughter, with his first wife, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46769/', "Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Campbell, first baronet")</script>, who died commander-in-chief at Madras in 1824. Kinneir remained as envoy in Persia until his death at Tabriz on 11 June 1830, when a three months' mourning was observed by the shah and the inhabitants.<br>
