<span class="headword">Ulster,  saints of</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>400&#150;<em>c.</em>650), <span class="occ">were the foci of religious life in the north of Ireland</span>. &#145;Ulster&#146; is here an early medieval counterpart to the province of Ulster (consisting of the nine modern counties of Antrim, Down, Donegal, Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan, and Armagh); a tenth county, Louth, now part of Leinster, was part of Ulster until the mid-eighth century. A loss of territory, partly beyond the reach of historical record but recent enough to have left traces, left the province of Ulster confined to the lands east of the River Bann. The eastern part of co. Londonderry was lost in the late sixth century, most of co. Louth not until the battle of Faughart in 735. The lands said to have been lost to the Ulstermen were principally the kingdoms of the Airgialla; these covered most of the central counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Monaghan, and Armagh. The far north-west, Donegal, and parts of Londonderry and Tyrone, belonged to the two great northern branches of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, Cen&eacute;l Conaill and Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain, claiming descent from Conall and &Eacute;ogan, two sons of Niall No&iacute;g&iacute;allach. The wider political context of northern saints' cults in the pre-viking period was, therefore, a long-term shift in power from the Ulstermen to the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill.<h2>
<a name="Sources"></a>Sources</h2>The sources are relatively good. Apart from texts which cover the whole of Ireland, such as the ninth-century martyrologies of Tallaght and &Oacute;engus the Culdee, the Patrician material, especially T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> from the late seventh century and the tripartite life from <i>c</i>.900, reveals the ambitions of the community of Patrick in the northern half of Ireland. Patrick's principal church of Armagh and supposed burial church of Saul were situated in the lands of the Airgialla and the Ulstermen respectively. A section of the fourteenth-century <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span> contains a fragment of a legendary of northern saints&#151;brief lives in the order of the saints' feast days in the calendar. The surviving lives come from August and the beginning of September. If the entire text had been preserved, there would have been exceptionally good information on northern saints. The textual history of this legendary has not been fully investigated; the standard view is that it consists of lives abbreviated not long before the date of the manuscript, using earlier texts of unknown and probably different dates.<br>
<br>There is a serious possibility that some lives in the legendary preserve information from the eighth century. An example is Inis Ca&iacute;n Dega (Inishkeen on the border of counties Monaghan and Louth), the church of <a name="cosubject_64440"></a><span class="headword">Daig mac Cairill</span>  (<em>d.</em> 587)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 18 August. The life associates Daig with the Ciannacht Breg, a kingdom which then stretched from the south of Louth to the Liffey. The saints' genealogies, however, make him a great-great-grandson of &Eacute;ogan mac N&eacute;ill, the eponymous ancestor of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain. Once this pedigree was accepted as true, Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain would be &#145;the kindred of the patron-saint&#146; (<i>&eacute;rlam</i>), normally enjoying a prior right to provide the abbot to the church. In the genealogies, however, the Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain pedigree is associated with the assertion that Daig was smith to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5413/', "Ciar&#225;n of Clonmacnoise")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51010/', "Meath, saints of")</script>], as <a name="cosubject_64441"></a><span class="headword">Assicus <span class="st"> [Tassach]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>480)<span class="occ"></span> of Racoon, co. Donegal, or Raholp, co. Down, feast day 14 April, was smith to Patrick. Both claims were designed to make the saints and their churches part of the <i>familiae</i> of the saints concerned; Daig mac Cairill is explicitly said to have granted his church to Ciar&aacute;n. In the genealogies, therefore, Inis Ca&iacute;n Dega was part of a network linking the great midland church of Clonmacnoise with Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain. Yet the connection with Clonmacnoise is also in the life of Daig, in which there is no mention of any association of him with Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain. The life's attribution of Daig to the Ciannacht Breg appears to stem from a period before Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain gained power over Conailli Muirthemne, the kingdom within which Inis Ca&iacute;n Dega was situated, as a result of the battle of Faughart in 735. A parallel case is the female saint, Femme, said in the genealogies to be a sister of Daig. A note in the martyrology of &Oacute;engus the Culdee places her in the church of Ernaide in Mag n&Iacute;tha, namely Urney, south-west of Strabane, in the late medieval rural deanery of Moghy (Mag n&Iacute;tha). Mag n&Iacute;tha was conquered by Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain from Cen&eacute;l Conaill during the 730s. The one genealogical fiction, therefore, served to buttress Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain claims to two churches in kingdoms conquered in the same decade. The subjection of Inis Ca&iacute;n Dega to Clonmacnoise, acknowledged both in the life and in the genealogies, presumably dates from no later than the first half of the eighth century and survived the establishment of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain power in what had been the southernmost kingdom of the Ulstermen. Presumably it survived because Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain wished to gain influence in a major church of the midlands. Daig's mother is named in the tract &#145;On the mothers of the saints&#146; as Dediu, granddaughter of Dubthach moccu Lugair, the legendary representative of the poets who embraced Christianity; she was also believed to be the mother of other saints, including Diarmait of Inis Clothrann, so that Daig's maternal descent gave Inishkeen an alliance with several other churches.<h2>
<a name="ThesaintsofUlstereastoftheRiverBann"></a>The saints of Ulster east of the River Bann</h2>In what is now counties Antrim and Down, there were three main early political groups of kingdoms: the Cruithni of south and west Antrim and west Down; the D&aacute;l Fiatach of East Down; and the D&aacute;l Riata of north-east Antrim, east of the River Bush and north of Glenarm. The political hopes of D&aacute;l Riata lay increasingly in Argyll and elsewhere in Scotland, rather than in their Irish homeland&#151;a shift of power which had a harmful effect on their main Irish church at Armoy (Airther Maige) and on the cult of its saint, <a name="cosubject_64442"></a><span class="headword">Olc&aacute;n</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 20 February. The <i>familia</i> of Patrick had had high hopes of Olc&aacute;n and D&aacute;l Riata, as shown by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's statement, late in the seventh century, that Patrick had given Olc&aacute;n a portion of the relics of Peter and Paul and other saints, one of the proudest possessions of Armagh. The investment, however, was a failure: the tripartite life records that lands belonging to Armoy had been taken by force and given to Mac Nisse of Connor and Sen&aacute;n of Inis Cathaig (an error for Sen&aacute;n of L&aacute;thrach Bri&uacute;in). The general pattern of these events is confirmed by a fragment of a life of Columba of Iona written by Cumm&eacute;ne Find, abbot from 657 to 669, which laments that D&aacute;l Riata was being subjected to its enemies.<br>
<br>From the mid-seventh century the heavyweight powers were a branch of the Cruithni, D&aacute;l nAraidi, whose oldest lands lay near Antrim Town, and D&aacute;l Fiatach, around Downpatrick. The most powerful churches in local politics were, among the Cruithni, Connor (Conderi, Condaire), and, among D&aacute;l Fiatach, Nendrum (N&oacute;endruimm). A principal saint of the Cruithni was thus <a name="cosubject_64443"></a><span class="headword">Mac Nisse mac Fa&iacute;brig</span>  (<em>d.</em> 507/8)<span class="occ"></span> of Connor, feast day 3 September, and of D&aacute;l Fiatach <a name="cosubject_18863"></a><span class="headword">Mo Ch&oacute;e mac Luach&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 497)<span class="occ"></span> of Nendrum, feast day 23 June. The tensions in the relationship of local east Ulster churches are well brought out by the story of Patrick's relationship with M&iacute;liucc maccu Buain (B&oacute;in), his master when a slave, and his friend <a name="cosubject_64444"></a><span class="headword">D&iacute;chu mac Trichim</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of D&aacute;l Fiatach, whose feast day of 29 April appears first in the twelfth-century martyrology of Gorman. D&aacute;l mBuain (to which M&iacute;liucc maccu Buain belonged) was the ruling group of the area around Broughshane and Ballymena; in the genealogies of the saints and in origin legends about Lough Neagh it is associated with its neighbour to the south, D&aacute;l Sailni, the people of Mac Nisse of Connor, Sen&aacute;n of L&aacute;thrach Bri&uacute;in, and Colm&aacute;n Elo&#151;of Lynally, but also described in a version of his life as the &#145;second patron-saint of Connor&#146;. The descendants of D&iacute;chu, however, were the principal ecclesiastical family of Saul and then of Downpatrick up to the ninth century: the story of their gift of the land at Saul to Patrick established their claim as &#145;the kindred of the land&#146;&#151;a claim that should have prevailed against all others since the patron saint, Patrick, had no heirs by blood. Downpatrick, originally a royal fort, became a church in the mid-eighth century. Since the strong likelihood is that Patrick was a slave in what is now co. Mayo, the role of M&iacute;liucc maccu Buain is fictional. Moreover, Patrick's failure to convert M&iacute;liucc is explicitly contrasted with his conversion of D&iacute;chu mac Trichim in Muirch&uacute;'s late seventh-century life of Patrick. The fiction, therefore, served to advance one Ulster ecclesiastical kindred, the descendants of D&iacute;chu, at the expense of two kindreds that were closely related to each other.<br>
<br>Local background to the story emerges from the dossier of another Ulster saint, <a name="cosubject_64445"></a><span class="headword">Do Biu mac Comgaill</span> <span class="st"> [Do B&iacute;, Mo Biu, Mo B&iacute;]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.?)<span class="occ"></span> of Inis Causcraid (Inch, Down), whose feast day is 22 July but whose obit is unrecorded. The parallel variations in the name forms make it probable that the patron of Inis Causcraid in the martyrologies is the saint ascribed to D&aacute;l mBuain in the genealogies. His church is the early predecessor of the Cistercian abbey founded by John de Courcy about 1180 as a refuge for the displaced monks of Carrick. Inis Causcraid was a mile to the north-west of Downpatrick, the main early &#145;seat of kingship&#146; for D&aacute;l Fiatach; similarly, Saul, the home of the U&iacute; D&iacute;chon, D&iacute;chu mac Trichim's descendants, was 2 miles to the north-east. The topography suggests, therefore, that the implicit message of the story was an attack on those associated with D&aacute;l mBuain. The two churches of Inis Causcraid and Saul were potential rivals to be the local church of the royal fort at Downpatrick. The descendants of D&iacute;chu at Saul had one handicap balanced by some major advantages. D&iacute;chu had no serious early cult: he was not included in the martyrology of Tallaght or that of &Oacute;engus, although his feast day (29 April) was included in the much later martyrology of Donegal. On the other hand, the late seventh-century life of Patrick by Muirch&uacute; had asserted Saul's claims to be the burial place of Patrick, the apostle of the Irish. The first target of the story about M&iacute;liucc maccu Buain may have been Inis Causcraid, but, given the close connection between D&aacute;l mBuain and D&aacute;l Sailni and the topography associated with Patrick's time as a slave, Connor may also have been implicated.<br>
<br>As for Mo Ch&oacute;e of Nendrum, the tripartite life has a story suggesting an alliance between the community of Patrick and Nendrum, concealing the truth that Nendrum was, in reality, a greater church by far than Saul. The genealogies of the saints connect Mo Ch&oacute;e with D&aacute;l mBuain through his mother, Br&oacute;nach, daughter of M&iacute;liucc maccu Buain. Both Nendrum and Connor were episcopal churches, and their bishops were among the leading churchmen from the northern half of Ireland to whom the pope-elect John wrote in 640.<br>
<br>Influential in a rather different mode were two churches situated close to each other but belonging to different kingdoms: Bangor (Bennchor) and Movilla (Mag mBili). Both had strong intellectual traditions, while Bangor, and probably also Movilla, had wide links with other major monasteries, such as Iona. Admittedly the founder of Bangor, <a name="cosubject_6027"></a><span class="headword">Comgall mac S&eacute;tnai</span>  (511/16&#150;602)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born, according to different texts, either in 511 or 516, and whose feast day is 10 May, belonged to D&aacute;l nAraidi; Adomn&aacute;n associated him with the Cruithni, just as Columba of Iona was the great saint of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. Moreover, some of the daughter churches of Bangor confirm its status among the Cruithni: Antrim (&Oacute;entreb) was within the leading kingdom of D&aacute;l nAraidi, Mag Line; Camus (Cambas), on the west bank of the Bann 3 miles south-south-east of Coleraine, probably dated from the period before the Cruithni lost control of the lands immediately west of the Bann. Yet Bangor's influence also extended much further. The annals of Ulster record what appears to have been a prolonged visit to Britain by M&aacute;el Rubai, abbot of Bangor, beginning in 671 and leading to the foundation of Applecross (Aporcrosan) in Wester Ross in 673. In the southern coastal region of Wexford, in one of the kingdoms of the U&iacute; Bairrche, the monastery of Ard Crema also belonged to the <i>familia</i> of Comgall. Members of the communities of Antrim and Applecross were to be promoted to the abbacy of Bangor (in 613, 728, and 802), according to the annals of Ulster, demonstrating that the links between these houses were enduring. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6002/', "Columbanus's")</script> ascetic exile from Ireland (<i>c</i>.591), after some years as a monk of Bangor under Comgall, led to equally enduring links with Bobbio, in the Apennines south of the Lombard capital at Pavia, but not, apparently, with his earlier foundation at Luxeuil on the southern side of the Vosges. The intellectual culture of Bangor in the time of Comgall is attested by Columbanus's two surviving hymns, one of them preserved in the antiphonary of Bangor, a late seventh-century manuscript written at Bangor and later taken to Bobbio, that also contains a poem listing the abbots of Bangor up to the late seventh century. The prestige of the community emerges clearly from a comparison of the obits of its abbots in the annals of Ulster and the martyrologies of Tallaght and &Oacute;engus: all the early abbots have their obits noted in the annals (then written on Iona) and with one or two possible exceptions all the early abbots were commemorated in the martyrologies. Among them, for example, is the <a name="cosubject_64446"></a><span class="headword">Sill&aacute;n moccu Mind</span> <span class="st"> [Mo Sinu]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 610)<span class="occ"></span>, feast day 28 February, who is recorded as having a particular expertise in arithmetical computation. The obits demonstrate that abbots were not recruited exclusively from within the D&aacute;l nAraidi (Comgall's kinsmen); again Bangor was more of a pan-Irish community than was either Connor or Nendrum. To judge by the annals and martyrologies, Bangor was the greatest monastery of Ulster, followed by its close neighbour Movilla, and then by Nendrum. It may not be an accident that the two leading houses, Bangor and Movilla, were close to the boundary between the Cruithni and D&aacute;l Fiatach, as well as being close to each other: they may have been placed there deliberately to assist peace-keeping.<br>
<br>The monastery of Movilla (Mag mBili) was founded by <a name="cosubject_50114"></a><span class="headword">Findbarr moccu Fiatach</span> <span class="st"> [Vinnianus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 579)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 10 September. None of the Irish collections of saints' lives contains his life. The only extant life is a brief text contained in John Tynemouth's fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Nova legenda Anglie</span>, derived from Welsh sources. It is intriguing that the stanza on Findbarr in the martyrology of &Oacute;engus says that he came to Ireland &#145;with [scriptural] law across the wind-swept sea&#146;  (Stokes, <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>, 10 September). He is there described as a <i>su&iacute;</i>, by which is normally meant a scriptural scholar. In the martyrology of Tallaght, the source used by &Oacute;engus, there are two separate entries under 10 September, first Finnio maccu Fiatach and then Findbarr Maige Bili. It is likely that &Oacute;engus was working solely from the second entry, since the phrase <i>maccu Fiatach</i> would have suggested to him that Findbarr was a native of what is now co. Down and did not come to Ireland from across the sea; also, he uses the full name form, Findbarr, rather than the pet name Finnio. At the beginning of the ninth century, therefore, Irish scholars may have been having difficulty reconciling two personae for the founder of Movilla: one was that of a member of the local ruling group, D&aacute;l Fiatach; the other was that of a foreign scriptural scholar. In the genealogies, Findbarr is even ascribed to the same branch of D&aacute;l Fiatach as D&iacute;chu mac Trichim of Saul. Of course, these two personae might be reconciled, either by supposing that the foreign scholar was adopted into D&aacute;l Fiatach (full adoption was recognized in Irish law) or by supposing that a native of Ulster had gone abroad for his education.<br>
<br>Two earlier pieces of evidence lend further weight to these suspicions. First, Findbarr's name in his obit (very probably from the Iona annals) is <i>Vinnianus</i> <i>episcopus</i>. The initial V-rather than F-suggests a Briton rather than an Irishman; it also terms him &#145;son of a descendant of Fiatach&#146;, but this designation was probably added later to the original obit (it involves a reinterpretation of <i>maccu</i> as <i>macc u&iacute;</i>). Secondly, Adomn&aacute;n gives the teacher of Columba of Iona three name forms, Findbarr, Finnio, and Vinnianus, using the Irish full name, an Irish pet name, and a Latin version of a British name. Unless an unnecessary emendation is made to Adomn&aacute;n's text, moreover, this Findbarr was still alive as an old man in 563, which means that he cannot be identified with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9476/', "Finni&#225;n mac Findloga, or Finnian of Clonard")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51010/', "Meath, saints of")</script>], who died of the great plague in 549 or 551. This casts doubt on the claim advanced in the life of Finnian of Clonard that Columba had been his pupil. The particular interest of the question lies partly in the indirect light the learning of the pupil, Columba, stressed by Dall&aacute;n Forgaill's <span class="italic">Amra Choluim Chille</span>, may throw on the learning of the teacher. Columbanus refers in one of his letters to correspondence between Vennianus (a variant of Vinnianus) and Gildas. Since Columbanus's time at Bangor, a few miles north of Movilla, probably overlapped with the last years of Findbarr's life, it is plausible to suppose that Gildas's correspondent was the saint of Movilla. A further strong possibility is that Findbarr was the Vinnian who composed a penitential deriving from the British tradition of penitentials (exemplified by Gildas's penitential) and subsequently used by Columbanus. The upshot, then, is that Findbarr was probably British; that his learning was derived partly from Britain and was reflected in enduring British contacts; that he was the teacher of Columba and influenced Columbanus; and, finally, that he made Movilla one of the major episcopal churches of Ulster. He was the last great British missionary in sixth-century Ireland.<br>
<br>Female saints were relatively common east of the Bann but their cults were, on the whole, only of local significance. A good example is <a name="cosubject_64447"></a><span class="headword">Br&oacute;nach</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;6th cent.?)<span class="occ"></span> of Kilbroney, whose feast day is 2 April. Her church, Cell Br&oacute;nche, became the parish church of Glenn Sechis, the valley running down to Rostrevor, co. Down. The old church was sufficiently important to be marked by a high cross. A similar figure was <a name="cosubject_64448"></a><span class="headword">Ercnat ingen D&aacute;ire</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of D&uacute;n d&aacute; &Eacute;n, later the parish of Duneane (including the modern village of Toome, co. Antrim). Her cult seems to have declined in the viking period: she was important enough to be commemorated <i>c</i>.800 by &Oacute;engus the Culdee in the verse he devoted to the saints of 8 January, but she was not included in the genealogies of the saints. To judge by similar churches elsewhere, Cell Br&oacute;nche and D&uacute;n d&aacute; &Eacute;n are likely to have been founded as nunneries&#151;or, at least, churches served by one or more nuns&#151;but were also pastoral centres with a priest or priests attached.<br>
<br>A quite different church and cult was that of Mo Ninne (Dar Ercae, Monenna, Modwenna) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18869/', "Moninne")</script>], founder of Killevy (Cell Shl&eacute;ibe on the north-west slopes of Slieve Gullion in south Armagh). Her floruit was placed by her first life within the first half of the sixth century; her feast day is 6 July. Mo Ninne was said to be the principal female saint of Ireland after St Brigit, a claim to which the only possible rival was the west Munster saint, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14495/', "&#205;te")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51008/', "Munster, saints of")</script>], of Killeedy, Limerick: not only is Mo Ninne's feast day in all the Irish martyrologies, but she is included in the genealogies and a life is preserved in the late fourteenth-century compilation <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span>. A later, eleventh-century, life by Conchubranus was then the basis of a further life by Geoffrey of Burton: St Modwenna was established as the patron saint of Burton. Her cult was thus exceptionally powerful for a female saint and quite exceptional also in being extended to England. The first life, was, however, firmly anchored in the area of her birth and her principal foundation, Killevy. Moreover the political geography is early: Killevy, south-west of Newry, was treated as part of the province of Ulster, as is Mag Muirthemne, the central plain of co. Louth. Mo Ninne is presented as one of the principal saints, perhaps <i>the</i> principal saint, of three neighbouring territories, Mag Coba (west Down), Conailli Muirthemne (around Dundalk), and Cuailnge (the Carlingford peninsula). The first life does not confine her to these territories: instead she is presented as a pilgrim who later returned home. Not surprisingly she was said to have spent some time with St Brigit, but she also travelled to the south of Leinster to become the disciple of St Ibar of Becc-&Eacute;riu (Beggerin Island on the north side of Wexford harbour). The difference, therefore, between Killevy and the churches of Br&oacute;nach and Ercnat was that Killevy continued over a considerable period to sustain a full community of nuns, while the other churches were probably local pastoral centres run by a combination of one or more nuns and a priest. The nuns of Killbroney and Duneane may have been in possession of their churches, but a major part of their role was to support a priest.<h2>
<a name="ThesaintswestoftheBannandeastoftheFoyle"></a>The saints west of the Bann and east of the Foyle</h2>In the lands of the Airgialla stretching from Lough Foyle to the southern part of co. Monaghan, there was usually not more than one major church in each kingdom capable of sustaining the level of cult likely to produce a saint's life. So, for example, <a name="cosubject_8827"></a><span class="headword">&Eacute;ogan mac Dega</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of Ardstraw, feast day 23 August, was the saint of the kingdom known after its ruling dynasty as U&iacute; Fhiachrach Arda Sratha (Ard Sratha, &#145;the Upper Part of the Vale&#146; of the Mourne and Foyle, gave its name to the modern town of Ardstraw, 10 miles south of Strabane in the north-west of co. Tyrone, the site of &Eacute;ogan's monastery). His church was the episcopal see of the kingdom, but <i>c</i>.700 it also had ambitions to acquire control of churches outside the boundaries of the kingdom. T&iacute;rech&aacute;n says that the community of Ardstraw claimed Assicus, Patrick's smith, buried in the church of R&aacute;ith Cungi in the south of co. Donegal. Although, therefore, the cult was solidly based in the principal church of a middle-ranking kingdom, it was by no means confined within that kingdom's borders. &Eacute;ogan is said in his life to have founded Cell na Manach in Cualu (the area stretching southwards from Dublin, along the east side of the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains as far south as Wicklow Town and thus including Glendalough). This accords with his pedigree in the genealogies of the saints which attributes him to D&aacute;l Messin Corb, a Leinster group of declining political fortunes which came, by the ninth century, to be settled between Wicklow and Arklow. Although unsuccessful in secular terms, D&aacute;l Messin Corb had one outstanding saint in <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5801/', "C&#243;emgen (Kevin) of Glendalough")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51009/', "Leinster, saints of")</script>]; &Eacute;ogan is said to have been his foster father. The life also gives &Eacute;ogan, as one of the leading Airgiallan saints, significant connections with other northern patron saints, which even extended east across the River Bann and so into the territory that remained part of Ulster after its early medieval contraction. He was particular closely connected with his neighbour Tigernach of Clones and with Coirpre, bishop and patron of Coleraine; more remote connections included Comgall of Bangor and Cainnech of Aghaboe.<br>
<br>Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn of Clogher, Tigernach of Clones, and Mo Laisse of Devenish were the principal saints of south-west Tyrone and co. Monaghan. Their churches all belonged to the two kingdoms ruled by the U&iacute; Chremthainn: Fernmag, approximately from Clones to Monaghan Town (ruled by the branch of the U&iacute; Chremthainnz known as U&iacute; Nad Sluaig), and the area around Clogher, ruled by the other branch, S&iacute;l nDaim&iacute;ni. In between their principal areas of influence, on less good land on the edge of Slieve Beagh in the north-west of co. Monaghan, was a small area whose principal saint was a nun, Damnat of Tedavnet (Tech nDamnat, &#145;The House of Damnat&#146;). Mo Laisse, Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn, and Tigernach all received due honour in lives written in their principal churches and preserved in the late medieval collections; Damnat's memory is preserved, other than in place names, only in the martyrologies and in the genealogies of the saints.<br>
<br>The feast day of <a name="cosubject_64449"></a><span class="headword">Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn mac Cainnig</span> <span class="st"> [&Aacute;ed mac Ca&iacute;rthinn]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 506)<span class="occ"></span> is 24 March. The <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span> preserves the latter part of a life, from the point at which Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn left his teacher (unnamed in the surviving text) and went to found Clogher. Almost all the rest of the life is determined by the situation of the monastery: it was to be founded facing the royal seat. The life thus gives an elaborate story involving three main characters, the king who remained a pagan subject to the influence of druids, his queen, and his son, both of whom were presented as ready to receive the preaching of the saint. A miracle achieves two purposes, the rescuing of the saint when the king's son was sent, albeit unwilling, to expel him from the site chosen for the monastery, and the safeguarding of the sleeping boy so that he could return unharmed to his parents. The king was then only too pleased to let Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn remain where he was. The surviving part of the life thus justified the role of Clogher as the principal church of the kingdom, a church which was also episcopal. It was not arguing a controversial case: Clogher was known as &#145;Clogher of the Sons of Daim&iacute;ne&#146;, that is to say, it was closely identified with the dynasty and the kingdom. In the twelfth century it would become the diocesan church of the whole area, including both Clones and Devenish.<br>
<br>The most interesting aspect of Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn's dossier is his genealogy. Since the beginning of his life is lost, this is only in the genealogies of the saints. Given the close identification of the church with the kingdom, it might have been expected that the saint would have been claimed by the royal dynasty. Yet he is said to have belonged to the Cruithni and his pedigree fails to connect him even with the major dynasty of D&aacute;l nAraidi (the U&iacute; Ch&oacute;elbad). There is room for suspicion, therefore, that the genealogical connections of Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn are early, going back to a period before the River Bann had become a major boundary separating the Cruithni to the east from the Airgialla to the west.<br>
<br>If Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn was the dominant saint of S&iacute;l nDaim&iacute;ni, <a name="cosubject_50136"></a><span class="headword">Tigernach mac Coirpri</span>  (<em>d.</em> 549)<span class="occ"></span> of Clones, whose feast day is 4 April, held a similar position in Fernmag. There is, however, one major difference: whereas Clogher was at the secular centre of the kingdom, Clones was further away from the seat of kingship, a crannog that took its name from Lough nUaithne (Lough Oony near Smithborough). The topographical advantage that Clogher held in the northern kingdom of the U&iacute; Chremthainn was held in Fernmag by Druim Snechtae (Drumsnat), said to have been the first foundation of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17166/', "Mo Lua moccu &#211;che")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51008/', "Munster, saints of")</script>] after he had left Bangor, and thus before his major foundation of Clonfertmulloe. Tigernach's western scope of activity within Fernmag is also seen in the foundation&#151;earlier than that at Clones&#151;at Galloon Island (Gab&aacute;il-li&uacute;in) on Upper Lough Erne (3&frac14; miles south-west of Newtown Butler, co. Fermanagh). This remained important since the site contains the shafts of two high crosses. Lough Erne was the western boundary of the U&iacute; Chremthainn kingdoms, so that Tigernach's churches were, unlike Clogher, clearly peripheral in secular terms.<br>
<br>One of the themes in the life of Tigernach (evidently written for his last and principal foundation at Clones) was his relationship with the more advantageously situated Clogher, represented as a seat of kings as well as a monastery. For the life, the dynasty of the U&iacute; Chremthainn had not yet split into the two branches, U&iacute; Nad Sluaig and S&iacute;l nDaim&iacute;ni. Tigernach, like Mac Ca&iacute;rthinn, was of alien paternity: his father, Coirpre, was one of the soldiers of Eochaid (Eochu), king of all the U&iacute; Chremthainn, with his seat near Clogher, but was himself a Leinsterman (of the U&iacute; Bairrche, as the genealogies reveal). His mother, however, Der Fra&iacute;ch, was Eochaid's daughter. Not surprisingly, the king had not given his daughter in marriage to an alien retainer; Der Fra&iacute;ch had fallen in love with Coirpre and had given herself to him. Once Tigernach was born, Coirpre acknowledged paternity and removed his son to Leinster, where Brigit met the pair and gave the child his name: &#145;Because he is the sister's son of many lords and kings, he will be called Tigernach [princely]&#146; (translated from the Latin in Heist, 108). Brigit received the child from the font and thus became his godmother, an example of a custom notably rare among the Irish, who were much more concerned with fosterage than with godparenthood. Both Tigernach and &Eacute;ogan of Ardstraw had, therefore, strong links with Leinster, but whereas those of &Eacute;ogan were with the less powerful D&aacute;l Messin Corb and with C&oacute;emgen of Glendalough, those of Tigernach were with Brigit of Kildare and, via his father's pedigree, with the U&iacute; Bairrche. The life has no precise details on Tigernach's Leinster connections; such as are available are in the Leinster genealogies, which place the saint among the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in, one of &#145;the three free kindreds of the U&iacute; Bairrche&#146;, but not in the royal kindred, to which, by contrast, Mo D&iacute;mm&oacute;c of Killeshin did belong. In particular, the life fails to name the first foundation of the saint, a monastery within the kingdom of the U&iacute; Bairrche. For the life, the saint's career before his return to his mother's country is a series of journeys enhancing the status of the patron&#151;to &#145;Rosnat&#146; in Britain for his education, where his teacher prophesied that he would found a distinguished church in the native land of his mother, to Rome for relics, and a subsequent stay in Leinster where it is the connection with Brigit that matters most. It was Brigit who not only became his godmother but also commanded him to be consecrated bishop.<br>
<br>Once Tigernach had returned to the lands of the U&iacute; Chremthainn, his mother's people, the concern of the life was to situate the saint in relation to the royal dynasty and neighbouring churches before allowing him to make any new foundations. His mother's father, the king, &#145;driven by carnal love&#146;  (Plummer, <span class="italic">Vitae sanctorum</span>, vol. 2, referring to the love of kinsman for kinsman, <i>condalbae</i>), wished to give him Clogher itself and to drive out the incumbent bishop. Tigernach was properly appalled by this proposal and removed himself to an unnamed and presumably small church on a mountain nearby (possibly Slieve Beagh). There his reputation as an ascetic grew, while he performed a significant miracle in bringing back to life Doach, archbishop of Armagh; the effect was &#145;a perpetual alliance&#146; between their churches. Once these arrangements had been made, Tigernach was instructed by an angel to go to the limits of the kingdom ruled by his maternal grandfather where he founded Galloon. Subsequently Tigernach was said to be moved by divine grace to grant Galloon to Comgall of Bangor and to remove himself &#145;not far to the east to a broader and more fertile piece of land&#146;  (ibid.). There he founded Clones, and with the foundation the life takes Tigernach first into &#145;a quasi-eremitic life&#146; of contemplation, encouraged by blindness, and then to a death attended by the angels who would conduct his soul to heaven.<br>
<br>If Clones was in a peripheral position within the lands of the U&iacute; Chremthainn, Devenish (Daiminis) near Enniskillen, the church of <a name="cosubject_18895"></a><span class="headword">Mo Laisse mac Nad Fro&iacute;ch</span> <span class="st"> [Laisr&eacute;n, Laisrianus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 564)<span class="occ"></span>, whose feast day is 12 September, was even more remote. The Latin and Irish lives both imply that Devenish was in an area subject to the S&iacute;l nDaim&eacute;ni branch of the U&iacute; Chremthainn, but the Irish life contains at the end an account of the wanderings of a people called the Dartrige. The explanation is given by an annal entry for 869 in <span class="italic">Chronicum Scotorum</span> giving the obit of Martan of the Dartrige of Daiminis, abbot of Clonmacnoise and Daiminis. Devenish, therefore, was situated within the client people of Dartrige, who, in the later middle ages, would take over the area formerly known as Fernmag, while the U&iacute; Nad Sluaig, rulers of Fernmag, moved further south-east, into south Monaghan, where the barony of Farney is named after their later lands. The Latin life does not give Mo Laisse's descent; in the genealogies of the saints his pedigree makes him a member of the U&iacute; Ch&oacute;elbad, the most powerful dynasty among the Cruithni of counties Antrim and Down. The Irish life, on the other hand, claims that Mo Laisse belonged to the &Eacute;oganachta of Munster and also gives a story about his birth taken straight from an origin legend of the &Eacute;oganachta; the explanation for this change may lie in the legend given at the end of the Irish life according to which the Dartrige were exiles from Munster. The lives are largely taken up with a series of miracle stories, with no obvious structure, punctuated by major incidents in the saint's career: his education under Finnian of Clonard, his triumph over a pagan king called Conall Derg (of S&iacute;l nDaim&eacute;ni according to the Irish life), and by a pilgrimage to Rome on his own behalf and also on behalf of his foster brother, M&aacute;ed&oacute;c of Ferns. From Rome he brought back relics of Peter and Paul, Laurence, and Clement, thus rivalling Armagh, and placed them in his cemetery, so that all those buried on Devenish would be as if buried in Rome. Before a brief account of his death, the life records his acting as confessor to Columba and as commanding him to go into exile so that he might win as many souls from damnation as he had, by bringing about the battle of C&uacute;l Dreimne, caused to be sent to hell. &#145;And thus arose the practice that all the heirs of St Columba should show reverence and respect to the heirs of St Lasr&eacute;n&#146;  (Plummer, <span class="italic">Vitae sanctorum</span>, vol. 2).<br>
<br>When Tigernach refused to accede to the king's proposal that he should be installed in Clogher, the incumbent bishop having been expelled, he retired for a time onto a neighbouring mountain. Damnat, however, the saint of Tech nDamnat (Tedavnet), was known as Damnat of Slieve Beagh, the mountain which Tigernach is likely to have adopted as a temporary retreat. Caldavnet (on the edge of Slieve Beagh) is also named after her. The enshrined <i>bachall</i> or staff of St Damnat was kept by the &Oacute; Luain family until the last of the line sold it to George Petrie (<i>d</i>. 1866); it is now in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. She has been confused with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8369/', "Dympna")</script>, the saint of Geel in Flanders. Damnat, however, is the best example among the Airgialla of the type of local female saint of which, east of the Bann, Br&oacute;nach and Ercnat were excellent instances. As Ercnat's church was in heavily wooded land near the boundary between two kingdoms and Br&oacute;nach's church served a mountain valley remote from all centres of power, there is a contrast between the great churches, Devenish to the west, Clogher to the north, Clones to the south-west, and the lesser church of Tedavnet, lying on the wetter soils of northern Fernmag towards Slieve Beagh.<h2>
<a name="ThesaintswestoftheFoyle"></a>The saints west of the Foyle</h2>West of the Foyle and the Mourne were the lands of Cen&eacute;l Conaill and Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain, the latter expanding, especially in the course of the eighth and ninth centuries, into former Airgiallan territory. Both these dynasties were branches of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, and their great saint was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6001/', "Columba of Iona")</script>, who had churches at Derry and Drumhome and on Tory Island. Another saint of almost equal rank was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/110/', "Adomn&#225;n")</script>, whose church at Raphoe lay within the minor U&iacute; N&eacute;ill kingdom of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ndai. An U&iacute; N&eacute;ill saint who was not abbot of Iona was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50073/', "&#193;ed mac Bricc")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51010/', "Meath, saints of")</script>], whose main churches lay in the midlands, at Rahugh and Killare, but who also had a church at Slieve League. With competition of this calibre it is hardly surprising that the north-west had almost no other major saints.<br>
<br>One church which appears to have been of some importance, especially to judge by the sculpture surviving on the site and by the relics of the saint, <a name="cosubject_19553"></a><span class="headword">Muru mac Feradaig</span> <span class="st"> [Mura]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>600&#150;<em>c.</em>650)<span class="occ"></span>, was Fahan on the east (Inishowen) side of Lough Swilly. Although Muru's floruit was the first half of the seventh century, his obit is unrecorded and he was not included in the martyrologies of Tallaght and &Oacute;engus. His feast day (12 March) is first given in the twelfth-century martyrology of Gorman. On the other hand he is given a prominent place among the saints of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain in the genealogies of the saints. The only surviving narrative about him is a late Middle Irish (perhaps twelfth-century) text included in the fragmentary annals of Ireland, in which the saint appears as a friend and confessor of &Aacute;ed Uaridnach, Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain king of Tara from 605 to 612. The bell associated with Muru is in the Wallace Collection in London, while his staff is in the National Museum in Dublin. In terms of relics and sculpture, therefore, the cult of the saint would appear to have been vigorous, which only makes more puzzling the virtual absence of textual evidence for someone who was, after all, one of the principal saints of an outstandingly powerful and enduring royal dynasty.<br>
