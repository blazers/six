<span class="headword">Lyon,  John</span>  (1734&#150;1817), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born on 1 September 1734 at St Nicholas in the Isle of Thanet, the son of the village blacksmith. Early on he exhibited a determination to improve his mind, taking a slate and books with him when minding cattle at St Nicholas Court Farm, before being apprenticed to Mr Coleman, an intelligent shoemaker in the village who was also the local doctor. About 1760 he was engaged as an assistant at a school in Margate owned by Michael Trapps (<i>d</i>. 1766), whom he succeeded as principal in 1766. Lyon compiled the first guidebook to the Isle of Thanet, <span class="italic">A Description of the Isle of Thanet, and Particularly of the Town of Margate</span>, published in 1763, when Margate had been a pioneering seaside resort for less than thirty years. In introducing prospective holidaymakers to the facilities and interesting places in the locality he provided a valuable source for the early history of the seaside resort.<br>
<br>Lyon learned Greek and Latin from the vicar of St Peter's, Thanet, who assisted his admission to holy orders in 1770. He combined the curacy of Minster in Thanet with his school until 1772, when he was elected by the parishioners to the perpetual curacy of St Mary's, Dover. His studies also embraced electricity, antiquities, and botany. He never married and lived frugally, wedded to his writing desk and his electrical experiments. His principal work was <span class="italic">The history of the town and port of Dover, and of Dover Castle: with a short account of the Cinque Ports</span> (2 vols., 1813&#150;14). Although there were earlier specific studies of the castle and harbour, Lyon produced the most comprehensive history of Dover to date, having already researched and published a history of the castle in 1787. In devoting 264 out of a total of 756 pages to the castle, plus original engravings and plans, he provided a unique piece of scholarship, especially as subsequent Dover historians bemoaned the loss or destruction of the castle records. One such historian, John Bavington Jones, wrote that he had been forced &#145;to follow the track of earlier historians&#146;  (Jones, preface).<br>
<br>Lyon, who was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, submitted two papers to the society: the first in 1775 described a Roman bath discovered in Dover  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 5, 325&#150;34), and the second in 1792 contained observations of the site of the ancient Portus Iccius  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 10, 1&#150;16). A letter to John Nichols in 1785 on the history of St Radigund's, or Bradsole Abbey, was printed in <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>, and his account of William Tothall FSA, which he communicated to his fellow antiquary Andrew Coltee Ducarel, found its way into print in Nichols's <span class="italic">Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth</span>. The Kentish historian Edward Hasted acknowledged his debt to Lyon for much information relating to Dover and its neighbourhood. Indeed in a letter of 6 April 1799 Lyon updated information supplied in 1791 and 1792 on the eve of publication of the fourth volume of the first folio edition of Hasted's <span class="italic">The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent</span>. Lyon also published four works on electricity, including one on the effects of lightning, and submitted to the Royal Society a notice &#145;Of a subsidence of the ground near Folkstone, on the coast of Kent&#146; in 1786  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, 16.91).<br>
<br>Much disabled by a fall in 1806, Lyon was voted an assistant by his parishioners. He suffered a gradual decay, a paralytic affliction that deprived him of movement and speech. He died in Dover on 30 June 1817 and was buried in July in the churchyard of his native parish of St Nicholas, Thanet. He left an estate reputedly worth &pound;10,000 to his two sisters and five nephews and nieces. As requested, his executors destroyed his manuscripts and correspondence, but his collection of books, shells, insects, and minerals was sold by auction in November 1817.<br>
