<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Courtauld family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1708&#150;1780), <span class="occ">goldsmiths</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_52485"></a><span class="headword">Augustin Courtauld</span>  (1685&#150;1751)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son of Augustin Courtauld (1655&#150;1706), a merchant from St Pierre in the &Icirc;le d'Ol&eacute;ron near La Rochelle, and his first wife, Julia Giron (1661&#150;1686), both Huguenots, who had four children. He was reputedly brought to England in 1687 as an infant, concealed in a basket of vegetables, to escape the persecution of the protestants. Romantic though this would have been, he was in fact left behind with his grandfather Pierre Courtauld and only joined his father in London in 1696. Augustin Courtauld senior was described as &#145;of the parish of St Anne's Westminster Wine Cooper&#146;  (Courtauld, 72) on the apprenticeship of his son Augustin to another Huguenot, Simon Pantin, on 9 August 1701, and appeared in the <span class="roman">Naturalization Act</span> of 1709 as goldsmith, St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
<br>Augustin Courtauld was made free of the Goldsmiths' Company by service on 20 October 1708, when he registered his first mark. The following year he married Anne Bardin, with whom he had eight children. Of his three sons, only Samuel [i] followed his father's profession. The registers of the Goldsmiths' Company record Augustin as working as a largeworker at Church Court, St Martin's Lane, in 1708. Augustin's earliest known surviving work is a set of three casters, marked with the date letter for 1710. He supplied members of the London aristocracy and specialized in silver vessels for the fashionable new drinks&#151;tea, coffee, and chocolate. He also developed an important line in two-handled cups. To judge by the many surviving examples bearing his mark, Augustin also specialized in trays and salvers, which, with their highly complex borders, called for the highest technical skill in their manufacture. By 1734 Augustin was probably running a sizeable workshop. All his recorded apprentices were of Huguenot descent: Edward Feline taken in 1709, Isaac Ribouleau in 1716, Lewis Ouvry in 1730, his son Samuel [i] in 1734, and his last recorded apprentice, Francis Quenouault, in 1739. Most of his wealth was channelled into his house and stock-in-trade, but he did invest &pound;500 in East India stock from 1732 to 1739, and thereafter &pound;1000. His prosperity was solid but modest. He was one of few goldsmiths in London to have his portrait painted, probably commissioned in 1730 from Hans Hysing. Though Augustin's mark appears on work until 1746, only one piece is made in the rococo fashion. It is probable that this was made by his son Samuel [i] who had joined him by the date it was made.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52489"></a><span class="headword">Peter Courtauld</span>  (1689/90&#150;1729)<span class="occ"></span>, Augustin's half-brother, was the only son of Augustin Courtauld senior and his second wife, Esther Potier (1656&#150;1732), also a refugee from La Rochelle, whom he married in 1688 or 1689 at the French church in Glasshouse Street, London. Peter was born in London and in 1705 was apprenticed like Augustin to Simon Pantin. He broke his indentures in 1709 when he married Judith Pantin, daughter of Esau Pantin of St James's, Westminster, another goldsmith and a relative of his master. Though he was entered as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1712, Peter Courtauld did not register his first mark until 1721, from an address in Litchfield Street, St John's, Westminster, presumably because he was still employed by Simon Pantin. His only recorded apprentice was Thomas Bonnet, whom he took in 1723. No piece of silver made by him has yet been identified. He was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields in 1729.<br>
<br>Augustin Courtauld moved in 1729 to Chandos Street, where he died in 1751. He was buried on 14 April at St Luke's, Chelsea, leaving in his will &#145;the sum of four hundred pounds&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/787/107) and all his utensils and patterns used in his trade to his son <a name="cosubject_52487"></a><span class="headword">Samuel [i] Courtauld</span>  (1720&#150;1765)<span class="occ"></span>. Samuel [i] was apprenticed to his father in 1734, and made free of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1747, registering his first mark at the Rising Sun in Chandos Street in October 1746, the premises acquired by his father before 1739. It is probable that his trade card in the Heal collection dates from this period. Samuel's work does not appear to have survived in any great quantity, and from the little that has there is no evidence that he was creative of new forms or decoration; he seems to have been content to follow prevailing designs and ornament. On his father's death in 1751 he moved to new premises at The Crown in Cornhill, facing the Royal Exchange, which attracted important City customers including the Clothworkers' Company. Only two apprentices taken by him are recorded in the Goldsmiths' Company registers, George Cowles in 1751 and Stephen Dupont in 1753. In August 1749 he married at St Luke's, Old Street, in Finsbury, Louisa Ogier [<a name="cosubject_40804"></a><span class="headword">Louisa Perina Courtauld</span>  (1729&#150;1807)<span class="occ"></span>], the youngest daughter of Peter Ogier [ii] (<i>d</i>. 1740), a silk weaver, and his wife, Catherine Rabaud, of Sigournay in Poitou. They had five sons, including Peter [iii] who carried on the family business in Spitalfields and was joint executor of Samuel [ii]'s will. Louisa is supposed to have been smuggled into England in a barrel of potatoes in 1729. Her father had come over earlier and set up as a silk weaver in Spitalfields.<br>
<br>It was probably Louisa's family connections with the City and the East End that contributed to Samuel [i]'s move. Their son George was apprenticed in 1761 to a Peter Merzeau, a silk throwster in Spitalfields, and began the family connection with the silk industry from which Courtaulds plc and Courtaulds Textiles plc ultimately grew. Her mother's will left money for her &#145;maintenance and education until she shall attain the age of 21 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail Weekend</span>, 12). Her father, despite his past as a refugee, left &pound;2560 to her and to each of her siblings. Only two years after being made a liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company, Samuel [i] died suddenly in February 1765 at the age of forty-five and was buried at Chelsea on 24 February. He left all his property to his wife, who succeeded as head of the business. She appears, from the presence of an unregistered joint mark of 1768, to have been in partnership with one of her husband's former apprentices, George Cowles (<i>d</i>. 1811), with whom she appears in the parliamentary report list of 1773. In the same year, 1768, George Cowles married Samuel [i] Courtauld's niece Judith Jacob. It was during this period that Louisa had her portrait painted, according to family tradition by Zoffany, a tenant of Augustin Jacobs, but more probably by Nathaniel Dance. The partnership, according to an advertisement in the <span class="italic">Gloucester Journal</span> of 29 September, was dissolved in 1777 when Cowles moved to Lombard Street. A printed billhead for Louisa Courtauld used for invoicing four second-hand dessert spoons in the 1760s is signed by her shop assistant Judith Touzeau, a fellow Huguenot and parishioner of her mistress.<br>
<br>Louisa's eldest and only other surviving son, <a name="cosubject_52488"></a><span class="headword">Samuel [ii] Courtauld</span>  (1752&#150;1821)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 20 October 1752 and baptized at Threadneedle Street Church on 25 October, and made free of the Goldsmiths' Company by patrimony in 1778. He entered a joint mark with his mother Louisa in 1777 from 21 Cornhill where they remained until 1780, when they were succeeded by John Henderson. Louisa retired to Clapton in Essex where she died on 12 January 1807 and was buried at Christ Church, Spitalfields. Samuel, according to the eldest daughter of his brother George, &#145;squandered his father's fortune in high living in France&#146; and later settled in America as &#145;a kind of itinerant merchant&#146;  (Courtauld, 87). He married Sarah Miles Wharton (1772&#150;1836), of Philadelphia. Samuel died in 1821 and was buried in the Old Swedes churchyard, Wilmington, Delaware. Thus, after more than seventy years, the connection of the Courtauld family with goldsmithing came to an end.<br>
