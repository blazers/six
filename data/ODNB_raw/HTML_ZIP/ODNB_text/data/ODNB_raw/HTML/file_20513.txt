<span class="headword">&Oacute; Conchobhair,  Cathal</span> <span class="st"> [Cathal O'Connor, Cathal Croibhdhearg]</span>  (1152&#150;1224), <span class="occ">king of Connacht</span>, was a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20524/', "Toirdelbach M&#243;r Ua Conchobair (d. 1156)")</script>, king of Connacht and high-king of Ireland. The third to rule Connacht after the Anglo-Normans arrived in Ireland, Cathal Croibhdhearg could not restore the high-kingship, but he secured a place for his kingdom within a wider world by obtaining rights and recognition from both the English crown and the papacy. He was honoured in several contemporary bardic poems and in the most majestic obituary eulogy in the Irish annals.<br>
<br>According to his obituary, Cathal Croibhdhearg was born at Ballinchalla on Lough Mask, Mayo, and was three and a half years old when his father died. This places his birth in November 1152. Three of the many women with whom Toirdelbach had at least seventeen sons have been named as Cathal's mother. However, neither &#145;the daughter of MacDiarmata&#146; (erroneously said to be also the mother of Cathal's much older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20522/', "Ruaidr&#237; Ua Conchobair")</script>), nor Derbforgaill, daughter of Domnall Mac Lochlainn (who died in 1151), is a convincing candidate; and the tradition that his mother was Gearrogingen hU&iacute; Mugroin, a concubine, is supported by an interpolation in the fifteenth-century <span class="roman">Leabhar Donn</span>. However, much of the traditional story&#151;his exile as an agricultural labourer in Leinster as well as the witchcraft that caused his birthmark&#151;appears to be a fanciful construct. Ruaidr&iacute; succeeded Toirdelbach and was himself succeeded in 1183 by his son Conchobhar Maonmhaighe, while Cathal was fostered by Tadhg Ua Conchean&aacute;inn of the U&iacute; Diarmada, one of the S&iacute;ol Mhuireadhaigh chiefs who traditionally attended the king of Connacht's inauguration and formed his inner circle. It is noteworthy that Conchobhar Maonmhaighe was assassinated in 1189 by some of his own officials at the instigation of a rival, probably a brother, called Conchobhar of the U&iacute; Diarmada. His son Cathal Carrach avenged his death, but it was Cathal Croibhdhearg who won the kingship.<br>
<br>A poet patronized by Cathal Croibhdhearg &Oacute; Conchobhair has given a striking, if somewhat idealized, image of him: &#145;He casts off the flower of his raiment while playing chess, he throws back his sleek soft hair with his long-fingered smooth red hand&#146;  (Greene and Kelly, 260). Clustering locks and tapering hands are standard bardic images, but the poets seem trustworthy when they say that Cathal's birthmark covered his left hand (which accounts for his epithet) and that he wore &#145;A crimson tunic like a red berry, a scarlet mantle decked with great ornaments, and a fine shirt like white chalk&#146;  (ibid.). Other items mentioned are his buskin with ornamental ribbing, his glove, and the ring on his left hand. &Oacute; Conchobair married M&oacute;r (<i>d</i>. 1217/18), daughter of Domnall M&oacute;r Ua Briain, king of Thomond. Two of their sons became kings of Connacht, Aodh (<i>r</i>. 1224&#150;8) and Feidhlimidh (<i>r</i>. 1230&#150;31 and 1233&#150;65); their daughter Lasairfhiona (<i>d</i>. 1282) married Domhnall M&oacute;r &Oacute; Domhnaill, king of T&iacute;r Conaill. Other children were Taghd (<i>d</i>. 1205), Toirdhealbhach (<i>d</i>. 1214, a hostage with the Anglo-Normans), Sadhbh (<i>d</i>. 1266), and the mysterious Ruaidr&iacute;, who called Feidhlimidh his brother and Felix &Oacute; Ruadhain, archbishop of Tuam, his uncle in a charter of <i>c</i>.1230.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Conchobhair initially maintained his predecessor's hostile policy towards the Anglo-Normans, the treaty of Windsor (made on Ruaidr&iacute;'s submission to Henry II in 1175) having expired with Conchobhar Maonmhaighe's accession in 1183. After surviving a violent storm on Lough Ree in 1190 that claimed thirty-six of his men as his ship sank and fleet scattered, Cathal Croibhdhearg tried to revive the high-kingship by promoting himself as a national saviour, &#145;a beautiful salmon with red rounded fins&#146; who would deal with the Anglo-Normans, described as &#145;blue shoals of coarse fish, ugly shapes&#146;  (&Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, <span class="italic">&Eacute;riu</span>, 171). However, he found little demand for his services. He did send forces to aid the kings of T&iacute;r Conaill, Ulaid, and Desmond in 1195&#150;6, but they were not used against the Anglo-Normans.<br>
<br>In 1195, apparently after Count John had granted Connacht to William de Burgh, &Oacute; Conchobhair burned castles in Tipperary where de Burgh had settlements. However, the same year he also revealed an understanding of Anglo-Norman society&#151;probably acquired from Anglo-Norman mercenaries employed in Connacht&#151;and a flair for diplomacy. Exploiting the jealousy caused by the grant, he made peace with Walter de Lacy and John de Courcy at Athlone. He also seems to have made a feudal grant of the cantred of Maonmhagh to Gilbert de Angulo, who provided him with military service. However, his attacks on Anglo-Norman settlements along and beyond the Shannon in 1199&#150;1200 were very much in the Irish cattle-raid tradition.<br>
<br>A series of military disasters made &Oacute; Conchobhair seek long-term tenure under the English crown. He was routed leading off livestock in Westmeath and lost control of his kingdom in 1200 when de Burgh invaded it in support of Cathal Carrach. After he returned from northern Ireland in 1201 with Irish allies who deserted him, Cathal Carrach defeated his Anglo-Norman allies and he was imprisoned in Meath as security for wages. He did overthrow his rival in 1202 by making a (short-lived) alliance with de Burgh, and he was probably behind the massacre of de Burgh's troops in Connacht later that year. However, he offered no resistance to de Burgh's attacks in 1203. It was King John who stopped the conquest: he wanted a royal castle built at Athlone on the Shannon first. In 1205, during negotiations between the two kings, Cathal Croibhdhearg demanded that he hold one-third of Connacht in fee of the crown as a barony, and the remainder for tribute. By 1207 John had given him a charter.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Conchobhair tried to bridge the gap between Irish succession and Anglo-Norman primogeniture by making his son Aodh a co-ruler and calling him his heir. However, he offended King John in 1210 when, after assisting him against the Lacys, he arrived without Aodh, fearing for his safety when John offered to give Aodh his own charter. John seized hostages and had Athlone Castle built; but Cathal, after a serious illness, made amends with a fine and military service and spent Christmas with the justiciar, John de Gray. On 13 September 1215 John made grants of Connacht in fee both to &Oacute; Conchobhair and to de Burgh's heir, Richard, warning Cathal that tenure depended on loyal service and assuring him that disseisin required the judgment of the king's court. When de Burgh tried to obtain seisin during Henry III's minority, &Oacute; Conchobhair appealed to his uncle Hubert, justiciar of England; but when Walter de Lacy built Athleague Castle on the Shannon in 1221, Cathal knocked it down, allowing the garrison to leave first. However, despite this and a similar attack by the Connachtmen in 1223, &Oacute; Conchobhair continued to receive royal protection, perhaps because the Lacy expansion into Br&eacute;ifne was unsanctioned. In 1224 the justiciar of Ireland vouched for his loyalty and supported his request that Aodh be given his own charter for Connacht as well as Br&eacute;ifne lands taken by the rebellious William de Lacy. The regency could not make permanent grants, but it granted Aodh the Br&eacute;ifne lands during pleasure.<br>
<br>The papacy recognized &Oacute; Conchobhair's royal rights even though it approved of English lordship over Ireland. In 1200&#150;01 Innocent III confirmed, and warned him not to abuse, his prerogative to assent to ecclesiastical elections within his kingdom; he also answered his questions regarding sanctuary so authoritatively that his reply became <span class="italic">Decretals</span>, 3.49.6. However, Cathal's relationship with Felix &Oacute; Ruadhain, elected archbishop of Tuam with the help of the papal legate in 1202, seems to have fluctuated. In 1213 Felix, whose diocesan reforms were controversial, was maintained by the justiciar during a period of exile; and in 1216 the pope seemed to rebuke &Oacute; Conchobhair when he told him to help the archbishop to implement the decrees of the Lateran Council, suppress hereditary succession, and allow free elections. Whether Cathal was behind Felix's imprisonment on his return from Rome is unclear, but in 1220&#150;21 Pope Honorius III granted Cathal and Aodh protection for themselves and their kingdom. His obituaries say that it was in Cathal's time that tithes were first levied in Ireland.<br>
<br>Cathal Croibhdhearg &Oacute; Conchobhair died on 27 May 1224. He was buried at the Cistercian house he had founded at Abbeyknockmoy, Galway, in 1190. The annals of Clonmacnoise say he died in Briole, Roscommon, but the other annals say that he died in the habit of a monk at Abbeyknockmoy. His other foundations were the Benedictine convent of Kilcreevanty (<i>c</i>.1200)&#151;which later became the chief Arroasian convent in Connacht&#151;and the Augustinian abbey of Ballintubber, Mayo (1216), a church that is still in use. The poets imply that Rathcroghan, in Roscommon, the traditional royal stronghold, was his chief seat. In the annals of Connacht's magnificent obituary eulogy, &Oacute; Conchobhair is portrayed as fierce and feared, yet generous, peace-loving, pious, and pure, a model Celtic-Christian king with a reign of plenty. However, Cathal and his circle were more cosmopolitan than this characterization might suggest. It is significant that two bardic poems were written for him from abroad, one possibly from Scotland, where two of the poets he patronized sometimes resided, the other from near Monte Gargano, Italy, on the return portion of these two poets' pilgrimage to the Holy Land. One of them also visited the Roman curia. &Oacute; Conchobhair seems to have had a highly developed, continental concept of royal prerogative. It is detectable in his relations with the papacy, in the growth of royal justice, and even, possibly, in the adoption of royal trappings not customarily used by Irish kings. The crowned head on a nave pier in Abbeyknockmoy&#151;with its fleurs-de-lis rising above the delicately wrought circlet and branching curled locks that seem to embody bardic ideals&#151;is thought to have been carved <i>c</i>.1224, perhaps as a tribute to his benefactions. After Cathal's death, Aodh used the theocratic title <i>Dei gratia</i> <i>rex Connactie</i>, while Feidhlimidh's effigy in the Dominican friary of Roscommon has a crown and sceptre with fleurs-de-lis. However, the story in the <span class="italic">Histoire des ducs de Normandie</span> that Cathal graciously accepted King John's gift of a great warhorse in 1210, but removed the saddle before mounting it, cautions against exaggerating his acculturation. The use of a chancellor in Connacht predates his reign, but his administrative system was largely a homegrown product of the twelfth century that enabled the king of Connacht to become a more autocratic ruler. His reign was one of stability&#151;except for the years 1200&#150;03&#151;despite difficulties with a few sub-kings and rivals.<br>
<br>Cathal Croibhdhearg &Oacute; Conchobhair's death was a turning point. A widespread rebellion against Aodh in 1225 was suppressed with Anglo-Norman assistance but it revived Anglo-Norman interest in what now seemed a weak Connacht. After the conquest in 1235&#150;6, Feidhlimidh held five cantreds (one-sixth of Connacht) of Henry III during pleasure, later less. Cathal's line through Aodh continued, but split into two rival branches, &Oacute; Conchobhair Donn and &Oacute; Conchobhair Ruadh, in 1384. The former has survived to the present, but the title &#145;king of Connacht&#146; was not used after 1474.<br>
<br>&#145;A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century&#146; by the poet James Clarence Mangan (1803&#150;49) tells of the times of &#145;C&aacute;hal M&oacute;r of the Wine-red Hand&#146;.<br>
