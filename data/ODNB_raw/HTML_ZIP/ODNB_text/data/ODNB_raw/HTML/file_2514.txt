<span class="headword">Blackburne,  Francis</span>  (1782?&#150;1867), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Great Footstown, co. Meath, almost certainly on 11 November 1782, though one source gives his year of birth as 1780. He was the fourth son of Richard Blackburne of Footstown, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Hopkins of Darvistown, co. Meath. He was educated at the village school at Dunshaughlin, co. Meath, and subsequently at the school of the Revd William White in Dublin, where the Blackburne family had moved, apprehensive of being attacked in their rural home during a period of agrarian disturbance. Blackburne entered Trinity College, Dublin, in July 1798, where he acquired numerous distinctions; he became a scholar in 1801 and graduated BA in 1803. In 1809 he married Jane, only daughter of William Martley of Ballyfallon, co. Meath. They had fourteen children, five of whom survived him.<br>
<br>Blackburne entered the King's Inns, Dublin, in 1801, and entered Lincoln's Inn in London in 1803. He was called to the Irish bar in 1805 and joined the home circuit. He specialized in chancery matters, though not to the exclusion of common-law work, and became a king's counsel in 1822. He became third serjeant in 1826 and second serjeant in 1830. In 1822&#150;4, while still a member of the bar, he acted as a special judge in the city and county of Limerick, pursuant to an appointment under the <span class="roman">Insurrection Act</span>, and helped to restore order at a turbulent time. When Earl Grey became prime minister in 1830, Blackburne, though known to be a tory, was appointed as attorney-general for Ireland, with a view to the Irish administration having a broad political base. He continued in that office until 1835, under Grey and during the initial short administrations of Melbourne and Peel. He was in charge of the government's legal responses to the campaigns of Daniel O'Connell and the disorder associated with Orangeism and tithe issues.<br>
<br>Blackburne was reappointed by Peel as attorney-general in 1841, and he became master of the rolls in 1842. In January 1846 he was appointed chief justice of the queen's bench, in which capacity he presided over the trials of William Smith O'Brien and other leaders of the 1848 rebellion. During the first government of Lord Derby (who, as Lord Stanley, had been chief secretary for Ireland between 1830 and 1833, during part of Blackburne's initial period of office as attorney-general), between February and December 1852, Blackburne was lord chancellor of Ireland. In 1852 he was appointed as one of the commissioners of national education, but he retired in the following year in objection to a perceived diminution in religious instruction in national schools. He was for some years vice-chancellor of Dublin University.<br>
<br>In 1856 Blackburne was appointed by Lord Palmerston as lord justice of appeal in Ireland. Two years later he was invited by Lord Derby again to become lord chancellor, but he declined on account of his advanced age and failing health. He changed his mind, however, and decided to accept Derby's offer but was told that the position had been offered to and accepted by Joseph Napier. On the last accession to power of Lord Derby in 1866, Blackburne consented to accept the position, to facilitate other appointments that Derby wished to make. He resigned with some ill feeling in March 1867, at Derby's request. Blackburne's son and biographer remarks that his party loyalty had compelled him to accept Derby's invitation in the first place. In May 1867 he declined an offer of a baronetcy, perhaps having hoped for a peerage.<br>
<br>In private character Blackburne was generous and urbane. As a lawyer he possessed extraordinary powers of mental concentration, wide experience, and profound acquaintance with every branch of law and equity. He had a dignified and courteous manner, a distinct and melodious voice, and fluent delivery. He resided in Dublin at Leinster Street and then at 34 Merrion Square; and also near Dublin at Roebuck Hall and then Rathfarnham Castle, co. Dublin, a substantial Elizabethan castle which he had bought in 1847. He died there on 17 September 1867 and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
