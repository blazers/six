<span class="headword">Lambert,  James</span>  (1742&#150;1823), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was born and baptized on 7 March 1742 at Melton, Suffolk, the son of Thomas Lambert (<i>bap</i>. 1703), vicar of Thorp, near Harwich, and afterwards rector of Melton, and his wife, Anne. His father had been educated at Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1723), and he himself followed suit. After being educated at the grammar school of Woodbridge he was admitted a sizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 23 April 1760, aged eighteen. He graduated BA as tenth wrangler and senior medallist in 1764, and proceeded MA in 1767, having obtained a fellowship in 1765. Ordained deacon at Norwich on 12 August 1764, he served the curacies of Iken, and of Alderton and Bawdsey, in Suffolk. He was assistant tutor of Trinity College for some years, and on 7 March 1771 was elected regius professor of Greek, after delivering a prelection, &#145;De Euripide aliisque qui philosophiam Socraticam scriptis suis illustravisse videntur&#146;. There was no other candidate. Lambert is principally known for having promoted the education of the eminent classical scholar Richard Porson after Porson, aged eleven, had impressed him in an examination at Trinity.<br>
<br>Lambert gave up his assistant tutorship in 1775 and for some years superintended the education of Sir John Fleming Leicester (1762&#150;1827) and his brothers in London and at Tabley, Cheshire. He returned to Trinity with his pupil in 1782, having resigned the Greek professorship on 24 June 1780. Lambert was unorthodox in his theology and increasingly adopted Arian views, which caused him to refuse any preferment in the church. He supported the Feathers tavern petition of 1772 that called for an end to subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>]. The controversial Socinian content of his lectures on the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> caused the master of Trinity to bar undergraduates from attending them. He was also a strong supporter of John Jebb, of Peterhouse, in his proposal for annual examinations at Cambridge, and was a member of the syndicate appointed in 1774 to consider schemes for this and other improvements in the university course of education; their proposals, however, were all thrown out by narrow majorities in the senate. In 1789 he was appointed bursar of his college, and he held the office for ten years. His radical religious and political opinions continued to cause friction in the college and the university. With Thomas Jones, tutor of Trinity, he was an ally of the Unitarian William Frend when Frend was tried by the university in 1794 for promoting Jacobinism.<br>
<br>Lambert died on 28 April 1823, aged eighty-one, at Fersfield parsonage, Norfolk, where he was staying with his friend Mr Carter, the incumbent. He was buried in the parish church. A road near Cambridge, connecting the Trumpington and Hills roads, is known as Via Lambertina.<br>
