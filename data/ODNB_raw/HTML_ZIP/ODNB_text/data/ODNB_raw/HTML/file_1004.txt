<span class="headword">Bacon,  Phanuel</span>  (1700&#150;1783), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at Reading on 13 October 1700, the son of Phanuel Bacon (<i>b</i>. 1652), fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and his wife, Elizabeth Harrison. His father was also vicar of St Lawrence's, Reading, and author of <span class="italic">A Pastor's Admonition to his Parishioners</span> (1728). Bacon became a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 12 June 1719, MA on 17 April 1722, BD on 29 April 1731, and DD on 9 December 1735. In 1734 he was presented to the rectory of Bramber in Sussex by Magdalen College. Later he was collated to the living of Marsh Baldon in Oxfordshire, which became his chief residence until his death in 1783.<br>
<br>In addition to carrying out his clerical duties Bacon established a reputation as a writer and dramatist. His first works of note were heroic ballads. In 1719 he published <span class="italic">The Kite</span>, an epic poem celebrating the foiling of the Jacobite plot. The poem was forgotten in subsequent years, and Bacon lived in relative obscurity for the next three decades. In 1756, however, <span class="italic">The Kite</span> was rediscovered and reprinted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. It was an immediate sensation, but was republished anonymously because the editors of the magazine could not discover who had written it. When Bacon's authorship was established his fame grew. He subsequently published anonymously a number of new works, all of which were based on morality plays. Bacon's dramatic works were satirical and comical, but also had serious moral messages. Five separate works appeared in one collection, <span class="italic">Humorous Ethics, or, An Attempt to Cure the Vices and Follies of the Age by a Method Entirely New</span> (1757). The plays were <span class="italic">The Moral Quack</span>, <span class="italic">The Insignificants</span>, <span class="italic">The Tryal of the Time Killers</span>, <span class="italic">The Occulist</span>, and <span class="italic">The Taxes</span>. Bacon may have been spurred to write them by his own experiences: in the preface to <span class="italic">Humorous Ethics</span> he makes oblique reference to morally bankrupt people who had troubled him severely, and been prosecuted in the law courts. The characters he created included Sir Amorous Flutter, Sir Jeremy Tippler, Mr Cankerworth, Mr Saveall, Mr Cholerick, and Mr Saunter Dolittle. As well as portraying morally flawed and straying people getting their come-uppance, Bacon was prepared to indulge in political satire. In <span class="italic">The Taxes</span>, for example, he chided the government for the proliferation of tariffs levied on everything from malt and ale to chocolate, paper, and clothes. In 1757 the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> gave Bacon's book a decidedly lukewarm reception; and there is some question as to whether or not the plays were ever performed on stage, though the subtitle to the collection includes the line &#145;as they are now acting to the life at the great theatre by His Majesty's company of comedians&#146;. His other works included <span class="italic">The Snipe</span> (1765), a popular ballad supposedly based on a true story, and <span class="italic">A Sermon on the Great and General Day of Judgment</span> (1731).<br>
<br>Bacon died on 10 January 1783 at Marsh Baldon, Oxfordshire. In his will he left significant properties and sums to Magdalen College, Oxford, as well as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and Queen Anne's Bounty. He was survived by his wife, Catherine. His gravestone contained a tribute to the modesty of his poetic wit:<blockquote>
<div>The soul of Ovid warbled on his tongue;<br>
</div>
<div>And his gentle [?] Harp Aubereon strung.<br>
</div>
<div>Athenian Wit reviv'd in all he spoke,<br>
</div>
<div>Stript of indecent gibe, and cruel joke.<br>
</div>
<div>His Mirth was moral, and without offense;<br>
</div>
<div>T'was Wisdom, drest by Modesty and Sense.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
