<span class="headword">Baen,  Jan  de</span>  (1633&#150;1702), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 20 February 1633 in Haarlem, Holland. Houbraken's life of de Baen, published within sixteen years of de Baen's death, would appear to be reliable because the artist painted a portrait of Dr Jacob Souburg of Dordrecht, Houbraken's father-in-law.<br>
<br>Both de Baen's parents died when he was three and he was brought up by his uncle, the painter Hinderk Pyman (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1647), in Emden. When Pyman died de Baen went to Amsterdam as apprentice to the portraitist Jacob Backer (1608&#150;1651). On qualifying as a painter and etcher, de Baen deliberately chose to follow the style of Anthony Van Dyck, because it was marketable. His only etching is of the <span class="italic">Burning of Amsterdam Town Hall</span> (dated 1652).<br>
<br>At some point, according to Houbraken, Charles II invited de Baen to England, sending Thomas Killigrew with the royal yacht to fetch him. This story is unproven. De Baen is said to have painted the king, Queen Catherine, and several courtiers, but in fact Charles II's principal painter, Peter Lely, was a jealous man, and de Baen made no headway at the English court. The known facts about his life are as follows. In December 1660 he was in The Hague. There, in 1665, he married Maria de Kinderen, and they had eight children, one of whom was the painter <a name="cosubject_7400"></a><span class="headword">Jacobus  de Baen</span>  (1673&#150;1700)<span class="occ"></span>. Jan was warden of the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague several times between 1666 and 1676. He took apprentices from 1672 onwards, and was governor of the Draughtsmen's Academy from 1699 to 1700. He was buried in The Hague on 8 March 1702.<br>
<br>Jan de Baen specialized in portraits of notable Dutch subjects: Admiral Tromp, Van Beverning, and Jan de Bisschop, the duke of Celle, and some court beauties were among his sitters, and also the grand duke of Tuscany to whom he presented his own self-portrait (Uffizi, Florence). He portrayed the young prince of Orange in antique dress (British Royal Collection) and he was patronized by the then current rulers of Holland, Johan and Cornelis De Witt. He painted an infamous <span class="italic">Apotheosis of Cornelis de Witt</span>, a huge horizontal picture showing Cornelis being crowned by trumpeting fames, nearly half of which depicts the burning of the English fleet in the Medway. It hung publicly in Dordrecht town hall. &#145;Filling their towns with abusive Pictures&#146; was cited as one cause of the Third Anglo-Dutch War of 1672&#150;8  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/311/101). After their fall later that year, portraits of the De Witts were ordered to be destroyed and de Baen's house was searched. Versions of the <span class="italic">Apotheosis</span> survived in private hands and can now be seen in Dordrecht Museum and the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Perhaps to ingratiate himself with the newly empowered Orangists, de Baen coldbloodedly painted the mutilated bodies of the De Witt brothers as they hung in the gallows after their executions.<br>
<br>When the French army captured Utrecht, Louis XIV tried to entice de Baen to paint his portrait, but the artist refused. Frederik-Willhelm, duke of Brandenburg, also invited him to Berlin in 1676, but de Baen sent his nephew and pupil, Jan van Sweel, instead. His wife is said to have prevented him from accepting these offers. He depicted William III as king of England several times, though none appears to be convincingly from the life. He was, according to Lionel Cust, &#145;a second-rate artist in spite of his success&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Jan de Baen painted several large group portraits for public institutions: <span class="italic">The Regents of the House of Correction in Amsterdam</span> (Historical Museum, Amsterdam); <span class="italic">The Magistrates</span> (1682; Historical Museum, The Hague); <span class="italic">The Drapers of Leyden</span>, the owners of the East India Company (Hoorn Westfries Museum, Netherlands). These works, painted from life, are among his more powerful compositions. Another fine portrait is <span class="italic">Prince Johan-Maurits of Nassau-Siegen</span>, with the gardens of Cleves in the background (Mauritshuis, The Hague).<br>
<br>Jan taught his son Jacobus to paint. Jacobus came to England during William III's reign, in 1693, and subsequently travelled to Italy, France, and Germany. He led a dissolute life and died in 1700 aged twenty-seven in Vienna.<br>
