<span class="headword">Bloomfield,  Benjamin</span>, first Baron Bloomfield  (1768&#150;1846), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>, the only son of John Bloomfield, of Newport, co. Tipperary, a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1828), daughter of Samuel Waller, barrister, and sister of Sir Robert Waller, baronet, was born at Bloomfield Lodge, Newport, on 13 April 1768. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1779 and became second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, at the age of thirteen, on 24 May 1781. Early in his military career he served in Newfoundland and at Gibraltar. He was one of the first officers appointed to the horse artillery. He also served on a gun-brig during the early part of the French Revolutionary War, and commanded some guns at Vinegar Hill during the Irish uprising of 1798. He married, on 7 September 1797, Harriott (<i>d</i>. 12 Sept 1868, aged ninety-two), the eldest daughter of John Douglas, of Grantham, Lincolnshire; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2675/', "John Arthur Douglas Bloomfield")</script>, diplomatist, and three daughters.<br>
<br>About 1806, when Bloomfield was serving as brevet major and captain of a troop of horse artillery with the 10th hussars at Brighton (and, according to his biographer, a poor man), his social and musical attainments attracted the prince of Wales, who in 1812 made him a gentleman attendant and afterwards, from 1812 to 1817, his chief equerry and clerk marshal. Earlier, when acting as the prince's spymaster against the princess of Wales in 1810, he was described by an enemy as &#145;a canting methodistical hypocrite, always talking religion and morality, but living, though a married man, in barefaced adultery with Lady Downshire&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 3.222). He was aide-de-camp from 1811 to 1814 and from 1812 to 1818 was MP for Plymouth, where the prince had electoral interest and a succession of &#145;Carlton House men&#146; were returned. He supported the tory government, opposed Catholic relief, and in 1818 vacated his seat, presumably at the prince's command, to accommodate another of his favourites, Sir William Congreve, second baronet. In 1814 he was promoted major-general, and in 1815 he was made KCH. He was auditor and secretary of the duchy of Cornwall in 1816&#150;17. From 1817 to 1822, as private secretary to the prince regent, he was the recognized confidant of the prince with considerable (some ministers thought unconstitutional) influence and power. He fell from favour in 1822 and resigned his appointments. His fall was attributed largely to the machinations of Sir William Knighton and the king's mistress, Lady Conyngham, though there was also talk of embezzlement from the privy purse. Cynical observers said he knew too much and, though his demands for a UK peerage were refused, he was generously compensated with a civil GCB (April 1822), a promise of an Irish peerage, a pension, two sinecures, and a diplomatic post. From 1822 to 1832 Bloomfield was minister-plenipotentiary to Stockholm, and while in Sweden he joined the Wesleyan connexion. In May 1825 he was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Bloomfield of Oakhampton and Redwood, co. Tipperary. He commanded the garrison at Woolwich for some years, where his hospitality and benevolence made him popular, and where he founded the schools for the children of soldiers of the ordnance corps.<br>
<br>Following a lengthy, painful illness Bloomfield died at Portman Square, London, on 15 August 1846 and was buried at Loughton, King's county, on the 22nd. He was succeeded by his only son, John Arthur Douglas Bloomfield (1802&#150;1879), a diplomat, who was in 1871 created Baron Bloomfield of Ciamhaltha in the UK peerage; at his death his peerages became extinct. His wife, Georgiana, published a two-volume <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (1884) of his father. In 1856 a tract was published, <span class="italic">A coronet laid at the feet of Jesus: as illustrated by the conversion of the late Lord Bloomfield</span>, by G. Scott, a Wesleyan minister.<br>
