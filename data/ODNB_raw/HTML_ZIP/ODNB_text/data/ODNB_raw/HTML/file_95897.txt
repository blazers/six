<span class="headword">Nicholson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Weeks]</span>,  (Lorna) Rosemary</span>  (1919&#150;2004), <span class="occ">garden historian and museum founder</span>, was born on 3 July 1919 at 17 Alexander Road, Southport, Lancashire, the youngest of the five children of Robert Foster Jeffrey Weeks, a mining engineer and a former officer in the Royal Engineers, and his wife, Louise Wilhelmina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Black. Rosemary's father had been badly gassed during the First World War and, on account of his poor health, the family moved to South Africa soon after her birth. She grew up there and in India and returned to England with her mother following her father's death during her teenage years. Rosemary's return was prompted by her gaining a place at the Slade School of Art in London. However, she did not take this up after her mother was told that the art school was not a respectable institution for a young woman.<br>
<br>On 21 September 1940 Rosemary married <a name="cosubject_95897"></a><span class="headword">John Edward Nicholson</span>  (1916&#150;1997), at St Bride's Episcopal Church, Glasgow. John Nicholson was born on 27 February 1916 at 27 Ditton Road, Surbiton, Surrey, the son of Herbert Nicholson, a general merchant's clerk, and his wife, Dorothy Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. During the war Nicholson served as an engineer in the Royal Navy and on his return the couple moved to Cheltenham, where John established a light engineering business. They had two daughters and a son whom Rosemary brought up while taking an active part in local voluntary groups. During the 1960s the family moved to London.<br>
<br>In 1974 the Nicholsons visited the church of St Mary, Lambeth, on the south bank of the River Thames. They had come to see the graves of the gardeners and plant collectors John Tradescant (<i>d</i>. 1638) and his son, also John (<i>bap</i>. 1608, <i>d</i>. 1662). In one of the most public sites in London, close by Westminster Bridge, opposite the Houses of Parliament, and next to Lambeth Palace, they found an embarrassingly derelict church and churchyard. Two years after their first visit, they learned that the church, which had been deconsecrated in 1972, was scheduled for demolition. Ardent garden-lovers, they were dismayed by this news and with their customary vigour set about doing something about it. They felt that the history of this most English art, and the graves of two of its most historically significant exponents, should be properly acknowledged. In 1977 they founded the Tradescant Trust in a bid to save the church and churchyard of St Mary, Lambeth, by establishing what would be the world's first museum of garden history. The Nicholsons assembled a notable board of trustees&#151;including David Piper, director of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Tradescants' biographer, Prudence Leith-Ross. Their children having now grown up, the trust and museum became the driving force in the Nicholsons' lives. The first meeting of the Tradescant Trust took place inside the church building, but required its initiates to use umbrellas and rainwear because of the openweave state of the roof. Within three years there were sufficient funds to construct a roof for the church, to clean the building, and to clear the churchyard, which revealed not only the graves of the Tradescants but also those of the naval officer William Bligh and his wife.<br>
<br>In 1981 the Museum of Garden History held its first exhibition, to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the death of the explorer and governor of Virginia Captain John Smith. Two years later the museum's garden&#151;designed by the dowager marchioness of Salisbury&#151;was opened by Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, who was an early supporter of the Nicholsons' work. By 1993 the building restoration, which included the east tower of the church, had been completed and the garden was in full maturity. Designed in the style of a seventeenth-century knot garden, the museum's churchyard garden, with its knots and period plants, took account of an important memorial to the Tradescants (erected in the seventeenth and remade in the mid-nineteenth century when St Mary's was restored). There is also a significant Coade stone memorial to Captain Bligh, whose career was also of botanical interest, and another to James Sowerby (1757&#150;1822), the renowned botanist and illustrator of William Curtis's <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span>. Despite the noise of London traffic only a little distance away, the museum garden was then, and remains, a place of peace.<br>
<br>Early in the museum's development Rosemary and John Nicholson initiated a policy of acquisition and donation, through which they built up an interesting permanent collection of historic tools, plans (including some by Gertrude Jekyll), and a considerable library of horticultural images and books (including John Evelyn's copy of the 1656 <span class="italic">Musaeum Tradescantianum</span>, the catalogue of the Tradescant collection). From its origin, the Nicholsons foresaw the museum as a place of formal and informal gatherings&#151;from popular and accessible lectures on garden history and other plant-related subjects, to book launches and exhibitions. Moreover, they managed not only to establish the museum but to keep it open with free entry. Its running costs were entirely financed by voluntary donations. John Nicholson&#151;a quietly unassuming and widely respected man&#151;had considerable financial and practical acumen; it was largely due to him that the museum's assets were safeguarded and developed. His death, on 25 September 1997 at Trinity Hospice, Clapham, was a profound loss to his wife and to the museum. Nevertheless Rosemary Nicholson had an indomitable will and, despite ill health, continued to work daily at the museum into her eighties.<br>
<br>Rosemary Nicholson was accurately described as &#145;redoubtable&#146; by a volunteer but accompanied this with generosity, warmth, and charm. The immense care and pride she took in her work was acknowledged when she was appointed MBE in 1989 and awarded a gold Veitch memorial medal six years later. She resigned as chairman of the museum in 2000, reluctantly yielding her place to a professional chief executive. She died on 28 October 2004 from heart disease at her home, 74 Coleherne Court, Old Brompton Road, Kensington, London. In January 2005 a stone plaque commemorating Rosemary and John Nicholson was unveiled in the garden by the museum's president, the dowager marchioness of Salisbury. In this way their memory, like that of the Tradescants, became part of the historic fabric of the museum they created.<br>
