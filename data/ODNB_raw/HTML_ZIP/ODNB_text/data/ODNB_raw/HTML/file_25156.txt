<span class="headword">Seymour,  Charles</span>, sixth duke of Somerset  (1662&#150;1748), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, known as the Proud Duke, was born on 13 August 1662 at Preshute, Wiltshire, the sixth and second surviving son of Charles Seymour, second Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (<i>c</i>.1621&#150;1665), and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1635, <i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of William Alington, first Baron Alington of Killard, Ireland. Charles the younger was the only surviving brother and heir of Francis Seymour, fifth duke of Somerset (1658&#150;1678). The fifth duke died, unmarried, on 20 April 1678 after being shot by a Genoese nobleman, Horatio Botti, in revenge for Somerset's allegedly insulting behaviour towards his wife.<h2>
<a name="Earlyresponsibilities"></a>Early responsibilities</h2>Little is known of the sixth duke's early life. Styled Lord Charles Seymour from 1675 to 1678, he is said to have been educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, but he does not appear in the admissions register of the latter. After a bout of smallpox in spring 1679 he travelled abroad with his tutor, Alexander de Resigade, in October of that year, returning in May 1681. On 30 May 1682 he married the twice-widowed Lady Elizabeth Thynne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Percy (1667&#150;1722) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21925/', "Seymour, Elizabeth, duchess of Somerset")</script>], the greatest heiress in England. From this point, as the possessor of a vast estate (worth perhaps &pound;20,000&#150;&pound;30,000 by the first decade of the eighteenth century) and the second dukedom in the kingdom, he began to receive a steady stream of honours and responsibilities. In November 1682 he became lord lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire, in July 1683 of Somerset. He was nominated knight of the Garter on 10 January 1684 and installed in April. As second duke of the realm he played a prominent part in court ceremonial. At the funeral of Charles II he was second mourner; he would fulfil a similar function at those of William III and Prince George of Denmark as well. In addition he carried the orb at the coronations of Queen Anne, George I, and George II, and was sent to greet the titular king of Spain, Archduke Charles of Austria, in December 1703.<br>
<br>James II named Somerset a gentleman of the bedchamber in May 1685 and colonel of the Queen's regiment of dragoons in August. As lord lieutenant of Somerset he took an active, but not a distinguished, part in the suppression of the duke of Monmouth's rising that year. As commander of the militia of that county he proved a difficult colleague for his fellow lieutenants and other high-ranking military personnel, in part owing to the ridiculous pride of birth which would be his hallmark. However, in summer 1687 he displayed a courage which has been less often noted by historians. When James II requested him, as gentleman of the bedchamber in waiting, to introduce the newly arrived papal nuncio, he refused on the ground that any contact with the Holy See was, in law, treasonous. Upon the sovereign offering him a pardon he refused; when James asked him if he did not know that the king was above the law, Somerset replied that &#145;whatever the king might be, he himself was not above the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.188). This staunch refusal led to the forfeiture of all his posts.<br>
<br>At the revolution of 1688 Somerset abandoned James II and joined the forces of the prince of Orange, but in parliament he voted against the concept that James II, in his flight, had abdicated, for a regency, and against the offer of the crown to William and Mary in January and February 1689. On the other hand, he voted for reversing the judgment in Titus Oates's case. The king stayed with him at Marlborough on his return from Ireland in September 1690 and dined with him at Petworth on his way to Portsmouth in February 1693. Somerset became associated with the opposition when, in 1692, he resisted pressure from the king and queen and accepted Princess Anne's appeal for the loan of Syon House after she and her husband, Prince George, had been expelled from the court. For most of the reign he was classified as a tory and refused to join the Association of 1689. He did join that of 1696, but voted against Sir John Fenwick's attainder and supported the impeachments of the whig ministers. On the other hand he is listed as against the place bill of January 1693. Towards the end of the reign, after Anne had made her own peace with William, he seems to have gravitated towards the court. William III dined with him at Northumberland House in May 1699 and visited him on his return from Portsmouth in May 1700. He was named a lord justice and a privy councillor on 28 June 1701 and lord president of the council and a lord commissioner of the Board of Trade on 20 January 1702.<h2>
<a name="CourtiertoQueenAnne"></a>Courtier to Queen Anne</h2>At the accession of Queen Anne she rewarded Somerset's loyalty in the last reign by making him master of the horse on 20 July 1702; the duchess became a lady of the bedchamber. Somerset was a conscientious and effective master of the horse, which was, during this reign, a cabinet position. He used this place, and his extensive electoral interest, to try to increase his political importance. At the beginning of the reign he was one of the few supporters, in a predominantly tory cabinet, of John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, and a more aggressive land strategy in the War of the Spanish Succession. But Somerset's support was problematic for the ministry because of his reputation for ridiculous pride, prickliness, and indiscretion. Early in the reign he was rumoured to have leaked secrets from cabinet meetings and in 1704 his partisan role as committee chair during the investigation of the &#145;Scotch plot&#146; led Daniel Finch, earl of Nottingham, secretary of state, to demand his dismissal in April. Instead, Anne purged her cabinet of Nottingham and a number of his fellow tories.<br>
<br>In parliament Somerset was a fairly assiduous attender and, while in office, a frequent appointee to committees and a representative for conferences between the houses. His voting record in Anne's reign was consistently whig, beginning with his votes against the occasional conformity bills of 1703. In 1706 Somerset was a commissioner for the Union and he was sometimes used by the queen to represent her wishes on crucial parliamentary votes, most notably in the case of the abortive attack on Abigail Masham early in 1710. From mid-reign Somerset grew increasingly demanding of Marlborough and Godolphin, presuming on his relationship with the queen and his vast electoral interest to ask numerous favours and especially military posts for his son, <a href="#cosubject_25156">Algernon Seymour, styled earl of Hertford [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and assorted political allies. Some of these individuals were men of real merit, for example James Stanhope, Thomas Meredith, and Hertford himself. However, the duumvirs found the task of placating Somerset increasingly tedious and the Somersets began to use their influence with the queen to make even more demands. In winter 1707&#150;8 Robert Harley, planning to supplant Godolphin as treasurer, attempted to woo Somerset and other great whig court magnates such as John Holles, duke of Newcastle. In the event, Harley failed: at a cabinet meeting on 8 February 1708, which Marlborough and Godolphin boycotted, Harley tried to carry on as principal minister; it was Somerset who stood up, pointed dramatically at the secretary and said that he did not see how business could be conducted without the queen's treasurer and captain-general. This action, supported by the dukes of Devonshire and Newcastle and the earls of Pembroke and Cowper, made clear to Anne that a Harley ministry was premature.<br>
<br>Following this incident the duke and duchess of Somerset, along with a number of other moderate whig peers, began to feel neglected by a ministry increasingly dominated by the junto. As early as December 1708 the duke is reported to have fallen out with the whigs. By the summer of 1709 the Somersets were cultivating Anne behind the Marlboroughs' backs and, possibly, beginning to make common cause with Harley. The first outward sign of a break with the Churchill circle took place over the Sacheverell trial in March 1710: Somerset played an ambiguous part, absenting himself from the vote on the clergyman's guilt, then voting for a light sentence. By June at the latest Somerset was intriguing with Harley and with Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, to bring down the ministry. Somerset's goal seems to have been to preside himself over a more moderate whig ministry. These intrigues culminated on 8 August with the dismissal of Lord Treasurer Godolphin. By mid-August, as it became clear that the queen would dissolve the predominantly whig parliament and that a tory ministry was in the offing, Somerset began to fall out with Harley. Despite being named keeper of the new park at Hampton Court in October 1710, the duke withdrew from court, became reconciled to the whigs, used his electoral influence for them in the subsequent election, and began sapping operations against the Harley ministry. A brief attempt to resume his seat in the cabinet was scuttled on 12 August 1711 when Henry St John, secretary of state, refused to sit with him. Somerset played an important role in convincing some peers of the queen's support for &#145;No peace without Spain&#146; in December 1711, and was &#145;louder than any in the house for the clause against Peace&#146;  (J. Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, ed. H. Williams, 1948, 433) when, in fact, she supported the treaty. Anne seems to have retained some regard for him until December 1711 when he attempted to deceive her over his opposition vote on the question of whether the duke of Hamilton could take his seat in the House of Lords under his British peerage as duke of Brandon. On 19 January 1712 Somerset was removed as master of the horse. There ensued several days of tense negotiations as the queen and a small circle of court whigs sought to get the duke's permission for the duchess to remain in her post as groom of the stole and thus near the queen. This was eventually granted. Subsequently Somerset was a consistent whig, voting against the French commercial treaty in June 1713 and the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span> in the spring of 1714.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>The famous story that on 30 July 1714, during the queen's last illness, Somerset, along with John Campbell, second duke of Argyll, played a crucial role in securing the Hanoverian succession is doubtful. That is, while Somerset and Argyll did rejoin the privy council on that day, they almost certainly did so after the queen had already been persuaded to give the treasurer's staff to the impeccably Hanoverian Shrewsbury. At the accession of George I, Somerset was restored to the mastership of the horse, but he resigned it angrily in October 1715 over the treatment of his son-in-law, Sir William Wyndham, following the Jacobite rising. Somerset had offered to be surety for Wyndham if the latter were allowed to go free, but the cabinet nevertheless voted to place him under arrest. Thenceforward the duke played little active role in public affairs. He is listed as voting for the acquittal of the earl of Oxford (formerly Robert Harley) in 1717 and in 1740&#150;41 as having given his proxy for various motions in support of the removal of Sir Robert Walpole.<br>
<br>In November 1722 the duchess of Somerset died. For a time the duke pursued, with an ardour that belied his years, his late wife's old nemesis, Sarah, duchess of Marlborough. While this resulted in a softening of the duchess of Marlborough's attitude to Somerset&#151;and therefore of his portrayal in her <span class="italic">Conduct of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough</span>&#151;it did not result in a marriage. Instead, on 4 February 1726 Somerset married Charlotte, the third daughter of his former antagonist Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham and seventh earl of Winchilsea, and Ann, daughter of Christopher, Viscount Hatton of Gretton. She spent much of their marriage nursing him through a variety of ailments. He died on 2 December 1748 at his principal seat, Petworth House, Sussex. He was buried on 26 December at Salisbury Cathedral. The second duchess died on 21 January 1773 and was buried at Chiswick, Middlesex.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>The sixth duke of Somerset was characterized by Macaulay as &#145;a man in whom the pride of birth and rank amounted almost to a disease&#146;  (Macaulay, <span class="italic">History of England</span>, ed. C. H. Firth, 1914, 2.918), a view borne out by much contemporary testimony. According to Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke, &#145;This noble lord was so humoursome, proud, and capricious, that he was rather a ministry spoiler than a ministry maker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 6.15n.). William Legge, first earl of Dartmouth, wrote: &#145;He was a man of vast pride, and having had a very low education, shewed it in a very indecent manner&#146;  (ibid., 14n.). William, first Earl Cowper, thought him &#145;a False mean-spirited Knave, at the same time he was a pretender to the greatest Courage and Steddiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Private Diary of William, First Earl Cowper</span>, 1833, 50, 16 Dec 1710). There exist numerous anecdotes, most difficult to confirm, of his pride and imperious manner: that he would only communicate with his servants through hand gestures; that he ordered them to clear the roads for his carriage lest he be viewed by the commonalty; that once, when his second wife struck him playfully with her fan, he remarked, coldly, &#145;Madam, my first wife was a Percy, and she never took such a liberty&#146;  (Craik, 4.351). It is said that he always required one of his daughters to stand as a sentry in his presence while taking his afternoon nap; upon awakening one afternoon to find that his daughter, Charlotte, had taken the liberty of sitting, he vowed to reduce her share of his will. He is supposed to have added a codicil reducing her portion by &pound;20,000, although if this is so it had been excised by the time of his death.<br>
<br>On the other hand, Somerset was clearly not without courage, having stood up to both James II and William III, first in opposition to Catholicism, second in defence of Princess Anne. Later he defied Anne's own wishes in his opposition to Harley in 1708, and those of George I in support of his son-in-law in 1715. He was an able master of the horse and managed to be present and play an important role at a number of dramatic moments in British history. Nor was he without taste or an appreciation for scholarship: he was a patron of artists and has been credited with suggesting the <span class="roman">Kit-Cat</span> series to Sir Godfrey Kneller and Jacob Tonson, and with beautifying Petworth House. He was chancellor of the University of Cambridge from March 1689 until his death. He was also created DCL at Oxford during the court's progress to Bath in the late summer of 1702. Appropriately, given his position as master of the horse, he was an avid sportsman and his horses won several important cups at Newmarket and elsewhere during the reign of Queen Anne.<h2>
<a name="Childrenandgrandchildren"></a>Children and grandchildren</h2>Somerset and his first duchess had at least four sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Charles Seymour, known by courtesy as earl of Hertford, was baptized by 22 March 1683 but died and was buried by the following 26 August. Their second but first surviving son, <a name="cosubject_25156"></a><span class="headword">Algernon Seymour</span>, seventh duke of Somerset  (1684&#150;1750)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 11 and baptized on 26 November 1684. For most of his life he was known as the earl of Hertford. Nothing is known of his early education beyond the fact that he undertook the grand tour in 1703 in the company of John Colebatch of Trinity College, Cambridge. Hertford returned in 1706 after narrowly escaping pirates in the channel. He was MP for Marlborough in 1705&#150;8 and for Northumberland in 1708&#150;22 on his father's interest. Frequently absent on campaign until the later years of the War of the Spanish Succession, he voted for &#145;No peace without Spain&#146; in 1711 and against the expulsion of Richard Steele in 1714. His most significant parliamentary moment came on 24 June 1714 when he proposed a bounty of &pound;100,000 for the apprehension of James Stuart, the Pretender, should he set foot in the British Isles. Hertford was also lord lieutenant of Sussex from 1706 and governor of Tynemouth Castle from 1710 until his death. He was most distinguished as a military man, serving as a volunteer at Oudenarde in 1708, aide de camp to Marlborough at Malplaquet in 1709, and colonel of the fifteenth regiment of foot from 23 October of that year. He saw active service in this capacity during the campaigns of 1710, 1711, and 1712.<br>
<br>Under George I Hertford was gentleman of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales from September 1714 until his resignation in December 1717 and captain of the second troop of Horse Guards from February 1715 to 1740. In parliament he generally supported the ministry: in 1716 he moved for the impeachment of the rebel, William Gordon, sixth Viscount Kenmure, and in 1719 he voted for the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span>. On his mother's death in 1722 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Percy on the erroneous assumption that the ancient barony of that name had been vested in her. There he supported Walpole. Subsequently he was promoted brigadier-general in 1727; major-general in 1735; lieutenant-general in 1739; and general in 1747. He was governor of Minorca, September 1737&#150;March 1742; governor of Guernsey, March 1742 until his death; and colonel of the Horse Guards regiment from 1740 until his death, with a brief interval in early 1742 when he lost the regiment on the fall of Walpole. Hertford was also president of the Society of Antiquaries from 1724 to 1749. Unlike his father, from whom he was estranged for most of his later life, Hertford seems to have been well regarded by contemporaries, as both a soldier and a patron; Horace Walpole thought him &#145;as good a man as lives&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 18.522).<br>
<br>Hertford married, soon after 1 March 1715, Frances (1699&#150;1754) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53787/', "Seymour, Frances, duchess of Somerset")</script>], daughter and coheir of Henry Thynne, son of Thomas Thynne, first Viscount Weymouth. Their only son, George Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, was born on 11 September 1725 and died unmarried in Bologna, Papal States, of smallpox on 11 September 1744. He was buried on 6 July 1745 in Westminster Abbey. On 2&#150;3 October 1749, just over nine months after his father's death, the seventh duke was created Baron Warkworth and earl of Northumberland, and Baron Cockermouth and earl of Egremont, each pair of titles being intended for different branches of his family. He died on 7 February 1750 at Percy Lodge, Iver, Buckinghamshire, and was buried on 24 February in Westminster Abbey. His widow died on 7 July 1754 at Percy Lodge and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 20 July. They were survived by a daughter, Elizabeth (1716&#150;1776) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59609/', "Percy, Elizabeth")</script>], whose husband, Sir Hugh Smithson, fourth baronet (<i>bap</i>. 1712, <i>d</i>. 1786) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21943/', "Percy, Hugh")</script>], succeeded his father-in-law as earl of Northumberland and Baron Warkworth in 1750 and was created duke of Northumberland in 1766.<br>
<br>The sixth duke and his first duchess had two further sons, Percy, MP for Cockermouth in 1718&#150;21, who died unmarried in 1721; and Charles, who died in 1711. Their three daughters included Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1734), who married Henry O'Brien, eighth earl of Thomond, and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1731), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30149/', "Sir William Wyndham, baronet")</script>. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30139/', "Sir Charles Wyndham")</script>, succeeded his uncle the seventh duke as earl of Egremont and Baron Cockermouth. Finally, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1722), married Peregrine Osborne, third duke of Leeds. Somerset and his second wife had two daughters, Frances (1728&#150;1760), married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17958/', "John Manners, marquess of Granby")</script>, the military commander and politician, and Charlotte (1730&#150;1805), who married Heneage Finch, Lord Guernsey, who became third earl of Aylesford in 1757.<br>
