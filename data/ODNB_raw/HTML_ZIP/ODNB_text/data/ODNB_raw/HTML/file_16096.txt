<span class="headword">Lathbury <span class="st"> [Lathbery]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1362), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian</span>, was born at Lathbury, Buckinghamshire, probably at the beginning of the fourteenth century; when he died in 1362 he was, according to Bale, &#145;an old man&#146;  (Bale, <span class="italic">Cat.</span>, 1.532&#150;3). He joined the Franciscan order in his twenties, perhaps in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, where he was ordained subdeacon on 22 April 1329. He studied at Oxford during the 1330s and 1340s, and had become regent master by 1350. In Oxford he formed a close friendship with a German friar, Hermann of Cologne; they discussed matters of theology and exchanged stories and moral exempla, many of which Lathbury later included in his commentary on <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span>.<br>
<br>Although a schoolman, Lathbury evidently was also active in pastoral work in the surrounding districts. In 1342 he was licensed to hear confessions in the diocese of Salisbury, and in November 1352 he was given the same licence in the archdeaconry of Buckingham. At the same time he became involved in the government of his order. In 1343 he was present at a meeting of the provincial chapter, and he may have attended others. Lathbury probably remained in Oxford for the greater part of his career, retiring only in late middle age to the Reading Greyfriars, where he died and was probably buried. In 1348 he gave several of his own books to a relative, a younger John Lathbury. The gift may have coincided with the end of his active career in the schools.<br>
<br>The elder Lathbury was distinguished for his work as a theologian and exegete. His most influential, and probably his only completed work, was a commentary on the <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> of Jeremiah. It is a vast text, incorporating a wide range of sources, including notes made by Robert Grosseteste (<i>d</i>. 1253), whose books Lathbury had studied at first hand in the library of the Oxford Greyfriars. It is most notable, however, for its use of rare and obscure classical texts to elucidate the darker passages of scripture. Lathbury's interest in classical literature, and his willingness to use it as a tool of exegesis, places him in a tradition of English (and especially fraternal) biblical scholarship which had been inaugurated a generation earlier by the Dominican theologians Robert Holcot (<i>d</i>. 1349) and Thomas Waleys. Their work had done much to revive the art of exegesis and promote a &#145;literal&#146; reading of scripture in the first half of the fourteenth century, but with the exception of Lathbury they had few followers or imitators. Indeed he can be seen as one of the last English scholars to employ these methods.<br>
<br>The commentary circulated widely in late medieval Europe; it was among the first books to be printed at Oxford in 1482, and one of the seven surviving manuscript copies was brought up from the bottom of the sea, in a fisherman's net, probably in the sixteenth century. Lathbury continually reworked and reorganized his commentary, and the revised version circulated in various different guises as part of an <span class="italic">Alphabetum morale</span>, a collection of exempla and sermons, and as a series of <i>distinctiones</i>. Lathbury may also have completed a commentary on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> which is now lost. The fifteenth-century bishop Stephen Patrington (<i>d</i>. 1417), according to Bale, quoted &#145;Lathbury on the psalms&#146; in one of his sermons. Bale also suggests Lathbury was the author of a commentary on the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>, and quotes an incipit, but it is not known to survive, and it is possible that in both cases he confused Lathbury with his kinsman, John Lathbury the younger.<br>
