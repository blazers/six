<span class="headword">Rawle,  Richard</span>  (1812&#150;1889), <span class="occ">bishop of Trinidad</span>, born at Plymouth on 27 February 1812, was a son of Francis Rawle (1778&#150;1854), an attorney at Liskeard, who on abandoning practice had settled at Plymouth; his mother, Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Millett, died on 6 October 1814. Rawle was educated at Plymouth new grammar school, and on 7 February 1831 was admitted pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, under the tutorship of William Whewell. On 19 April 1833 he obtained a scholarship at his college, and in 1835 he graduated BA, being third wrangler and fourth classic. He was elected minor fellow of Trinity College on 3 October 1836, and major fellow on 3 July 1838, in which year he proceeded MA and became sub-lector <i>tertius</i>; he acted as assistant tutor from 1836 to 1839. In 1839 he was ordained both deacon and priest, and accepted the rectory of Cheadle in Staffordshire. He resigned his post in 1847, though he returned to marry on 14 January 1851 at Cheadle parish church Susan Anne Blagg, daughter of John Michael Blagg, of Rosehill in that parish.<br>
<br>From 1847 to 1864 Rawle was principal of Codrington College in Barbados; about 1859 he declined the offer of the bishopric of Antigua. In 1864 he returned to England, and after refusing the offer of an honorary canonry in Ely Cathedral he acted as vicar of Tamworth, from 1869 to 1872. On 29 June 1872 he was consecrated in Lichfield Cathedral as bishop of Trinidad, where he worked with great energy until his resignation in 1888. His wife died on 1 March 1888 at Bournemouth, and was buried at Cheadle churchyard on 5 March. Rawle reaccepted the post of principal and professor of divinity at Codrington College, where he died on 10 May 1889; he was buried next day in the college burial-ground.<br>
<br>Rawle was the last male representative of the family of Rawle owning the farmstead of Hennett and other property in the parish of St Juliot, on the north coast of Cornwall, and his generosity raised the income of the benefice, restored the church, and built new schools.<br>
