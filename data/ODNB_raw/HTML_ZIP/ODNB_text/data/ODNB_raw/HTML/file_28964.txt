<span class="headword">Wedge,  John Helder</span>  (1793&#150;1872), <span class="occ">surveyor and politician in Tasmania</span>, was born at Shudy Camps, near Linton, Cambridgeshire, on 27 February 1793, the second son of Charles Wedge (1747?&#150;1842), a surveyor, and his wife, Elizabeth. John worked with his older brother, Edward, on a Lincolnshire farm, but agricultural depression induced them to think of emigrating. His father had trained him as a surveyor and in 1823 obtained for him an appointment in Van Diemen's Land, where he arrived the following April with Edward and his family. He helped Edward in saw-milling and farming ventures and trained his nephews, Charles Wedge and John Darke, as surveyors, while investigating former frauds in the survey department and, as an energetic and resourceful bushman, undertaking exploring expeditions in difficult parts of the colony. His report on the land grant to the Van Diemen's Land Company led to its increase from 250,000 to 350,000 acres, but his recommendation to reserve land at Emu Bay for a township was disregarded, though it was the only site suitable for a port not already in the company's possession.<br>
<br>On his arrival Wedge had been granted 1500 acres (Leighlands) near Perth and soon became friendly with John Batman; like him he wanted more land for his sheep and in 1835 was glad to join the Port Phillip Association, formed to &#145;buy&#146; grazing land from the Port Phillip Aborigines. When Batman reported in June a successful &#145;purchase&#146;, Wedge drew the maps needed to support its claims, resigned from the survey department, and in August crossed to Port Phillip, the first of the partners to do so, landing near its entrance at the association's base at Indented Head on the Bellarine peninsula. He explored the area to the south-west (he later published his <span class="italic">Narrative</span> in the proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society), and then went to the River Yarra, where on 2 September he found the party financed by J. P. Fawkner encamped on land which he claimed (mistakenly) that Batman had &#145;bought&#146;. He reached agreement with this group, and moved the association's &#145;headquarters&#146; to the site, but before the imperial government's decision on its claims was known he sold his interest in it to his partners. For two years he frequently visited Port Phillip: he bought two city blocks in 1837 and shared a &#145;run&#146; with his relatives at Werribee, selling out (for &pound;18,000) only in 1854 after floods destroyed the homestead and drowned Edward, his wife, and unmarried daughter.<br>
<br>In December 1837 Wedge had returned to England, when he presented a collection of birds, animals, and ethnological specimens to the museum at Saffron Walden. He farmed in Suffolk, and protested to the Colonial Office about the treatment of both the Port Phillip Association and the Aborigines at Port Phillip. After his father died in 1842, he returned to Van Diemen's Land, becoming engaged aboard ship to Maria Medland Wills, of Dartmouth, Devon, the governess to Bishop Francis Russell Nixon's six children. They were married in St David's Cathedral, Hobart, on 28 December 1843; tragically Maria died in childbirth the following November.<br>
<br>A devout Anglican, Wedge remained a friend and adviser to the bishop, who asked him to manage the church lands at Bishopsbourne. He was elected to the legislative council in 1855, where he led protests against maladministration in the convict department and helped to settle the question of state aid to religion.<br>
<br>Described in the <span class="italic">Hobart Mercury</span> by one of his successors, the surveyor J. E. Calder, as &#145;a high-minded gentleman who never thought a mean thought and was incapable of doing a dirty action&#146;, Wedge resided for many years at Leighlands, but in 1865 he moved to property at Medlands, on the River Forth, where he died on 22 November 1872. He was buried in Perth cemetery.<br>
