<span class="headword">Shipman,  Thomas</span>  (1632&#150;1680), <span class="occ">poet</span>, the eldest son of William Shipman (1603&#150;1658) and Sara, daughter of Alderman Parker of Nottingham, was born at Scarrington, near Newark, in November 1632, and baptized there on 8 November. The eldest of eleven or twelve children of his father's second marriage, he received his early education at Sleaford School and was admitted as a pensioner to St John's College, Cambridge, on 1 May 1651. There is no record of his having taken a degree. He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1696), daughter of John Trafford, who brought him a good inheritance; they had several sons, the third of whom, William, became high sheriff of Nottingham in 1730.<br>
<br>In the preface to a collection of some 200 poems which he was compiling at the time of his death, Shipman confessed that he still retained his youthful love of poetry and could see &#145;no cause but <i>Dotage</i> to make it be left off&#146;. The poet Thomas Flatman, who eventually saw the volume through the press as <span class="italic">Carolina, or, Loyal Poems</span> (1683), informed prospective readers that his friend was &#145;a Man every way accomplish'd&#146;, whose conversation had recommended him to &#145;the best Wits of the Age&#146;. Shipman's political sympathies are evident in poems on the royal martyr, the passing of Cromwell (&#145;The Arch-Traitor&#146;), the restoration of Charles II, and the virtues of the duke of Monmouth (&#145;The Hero&#146;).<br>
<br>Having preserved the family estate by retiring from public life during the protectorate, Shipman entered into his full inheritance as a cultivated country squire after 1660, living on familiar terms with the local aristocracy and assisting Dr Robert Thoroton in his study of Nottinghamshire antiquities. He also became a captain of the trained bands in the county. Shipman's heroic tragedy, <span class="italic">Henry the Third of France</span>, performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1678, was designed to support Monmouth at the time of the Popish Plot. In a preface to the published text, he defends the use of rhyming couplets, generously praises <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> as &#145;noble, strong and fanciful&#146;, and imagines &#145;what a <i>Poem</i>&#146; it might have been if Milton had not eschewed rhyme.<br>
<br>Shipman died at Scarrington, where he was buried on 15 October 1680. He was survived by his wife.<br>
