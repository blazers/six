<span class="headword">Hoban,  James</span>  (1762&#150;1831), <span class="occ">architect and designer</span>, was born in Callan, co. Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of Edward Hoban and his wife, Martha <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayne. Details of his early life are not known, but he studied drawing under Thomas Ivory in one of the schools of the Dublin Society, and in 1780 was awarded a premium for drawings of architectural details. He was then employed, probably as a joiner, in the construction of several Dublin buildings, including the royal exchange (now the city hall) and the custom house. Seeking more opportunity for advancement, he emigrated to the United States after the American War of Independence and settled first in Philadelphia, where in May 1785 he advertised his services as a joiner and carpenter.<br>
<br>Two years later Hoban moved to South Carolina, where he met George Washington, who was then on a tour of the southern states. This led to his selection as one of the nine architects who took part in the competition of 1792 to design the proposed federal public buildings. He won the competition for the design of the President's House, later called the White House, and was appointed to supervise its construction at a salary of 300 guineas a year. He thereupon moved to Washington, where he stayed for the rest of his life. The principal elevation was originally based on plate 51 in James Gibbs's <span class="italic">Book of Architecture</span> (1728), and bore a distinct resemblance to Leinster House (1751) in Dublin. Subsequent changes, including some suggested by Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and later additions by Benjamin Latrobe which were executed by Hoban in 1824 and 1829, resulted in the present well-known fa&ccedil;ade. The corner-stone of the building was laid by President Washington on 13 September 1793, and Hoban assisted at the ceremony as master of the federal masonic lodge, which he had helped to organize a few days before. The building, still unfinished at the time, was first occupied by President Adams in 1800, and Hoban continued in charge until its initial completion in 1803.<br>
<br>At the same time Hoban was employed at intervals to superintend the construction of the Capitol, until Latrobe became the surveyor of public buildings in 1803; he also engaged in the construction of other public and private buildings, and the purchase of numerous plots of land, in and around the federal capital. By 1799 he was captain of the Washington artillery, and in January of the same year he married Susannah Sewell, with whom he had ten children, one of whom, James (<i>c</i>.1808&#150;1846), became the district attorney in Washington. During the presidency of Jefferson (1801&#150;9), who was himself an accomplished architect, Hoban got few government commissions, but by that time he was no longer dependent on them as a major source of income. On the incorporation of the city of Washington in 1802 he was elected to the city council and remained a member until his death.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the Anglo-American War a detachment of British forces under General Robert Ross marched on Washington and burnt some of the principal buildings, including the Capitol and the White House. The interior of the White House was destroyed but the stonework survived, and Hoban supervised the work of rebuilding from 1815 to 1829. During the same period he was responsible for the design and construction of the state department and war department buildings, commenced in 1818. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> describes him as &#145;quiet and conciliatory, but self-respecting and capable of firmness when occasion demanded&#146; and refers to his &#145;knowledge, abilities and probity&#146; as a &#145;solid citizen and patriarch of the city&#146;. He died in Washington on 8 December 1831, leaving an estate valued at $60,000  (<span class="italic">DAB</span>). His grave was later moved to Mount Olivet cemetery in the city of Washington after it was founded as a Roman Catholic cemetery in 1858.<br>
