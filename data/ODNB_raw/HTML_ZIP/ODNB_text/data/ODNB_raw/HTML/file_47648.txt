<span class="headword">Pollard,  Samuel</span>  (1864&#150;1915), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 20 April 1864 at Camelford, Cornwall, the eldest son of Samuel Pollard, a minister of the Bible Christian Methodist church, and his wife, Ellen DeBoyne. From the age of twelve he was educated in the denominational school at Shebbear, north Devon. In 1881 he was placed high in the civil service examination and began work in the post office at Clapham.<br>
<br>While in London, Pollard offered for the ministry and for service with the Bible Christian church's newly opened mission in China. &#145;Vanstone and Thorne have left for China, and I shall be the next&#146;  (Grist, 10), he wrote to his parents. At the time Pollard volunteered for China another Shebbear boy, Frank Dymond, also offered for work in that land. The two were accepted, and in January 1887 sailed for China, thus beginning a friendship which would last for the rest of Pollard's life.<br>
<br>After language study in Shanghai the two friends set out for Yunnan. They had a narrow escape from drowning when their boat capsized on the River Yangtze (Yangzi), but finally arrived in the city of Chaotung (Zhaotong) to join Samuel Thorne. Within days the newcomers found themselves in charge of the mission when Thorne left to get married in Chongqing, and the days passed quickly with preaching and study. They had a small supply of simple medicines and gained a reputation for the treatment of commonplace diseases such as the infected eyes of children, and the treatment of worms and malaria. Pollard also became known for his success in saving opium attempted suicide cases, and this aided the preaching of the gospel. The friendship of the two missionaries was deepened when Samuel nursed Frank Dymond through a severe bout of smallpox.<br>
<br>On Thorne's return Sam Pollard left Chaotung to join Thomas Vanstone in Kunming. The years 1890&#150;91 were a discouraging period for the small missionary band. Samuel Thorne died, and illness struck the Vanstone family. One light in those dark days was Sam's meeting with Emma Hainge of the China Inland Mission. They fell in love and were married in Chongqing in December 1891. On their return to Chaotung the couple threw themselves with renewed zeal into the work and during a desperate famine helped many stricken families. At the end of 1894 they left China for a much needed furlough, and on his return Samuel was appointed to take charge of the work in north Yunnan.<br>
<br>The anti-foreign Boxer uprising at the turn of the century brought disruption and danger to missionaries. In April 1899 Pollard escaped an assassination attempt, and the family fled to Hong Kong. Foreign intervention crushed the rebellion and in 1901 Sam, now back in Chaotung, organized a number of preaching tours, during which his contacts with Nosu tribesmen kindled the desire to reach the non-Chinese aboriginal people with the gospel. The Nosu were largely independent of Chinese rule, and in November 1903 Pollard visited their territory. His book <span class="italic">In Unknown China</span> (1920) recorded this journey. While planning to revisit Nosuland an event took place which changed the whole course of his future ministry. On the morning of 12 July 1904 four Miao came to the mission compound. The Miao were very different from the Nosu. They were landless, had no written language or schools, and were often exploited by Chinese and Nosu landlords. The four Miao had heard fragments of the Jesus story and came to make further enquiries about Christianity. During the following year some 4000 Miao enquirers passed through Pollard's home, and in 1905 it was decided that Sam should concentrate on evangelizing them. He was given land by a Nosu chief at a place called Stonegateway, and it became the centre of the Miao mission. Life was often hazardous, and in April 1907 Pollard was beaten by a mob and left more dead than alive. During a long period of convalescence he reflected on work already achieved and in May 1907 recorded there were now five chapels, three schools, ten evangelists in training, and more than 3000 Miao church members.<br>
<br>The Miao had no written language, and an entry in Pollard's diary on 12 October 1904 expressed his concern. &#145;Today I made an experiment in getting out a written language for the Miao&#151;making my own consonants and vowels to match their sounds. So far so good, but how can I manage to distinguish tones?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eyes of the Earth</span>, 82) In his book <span class="italic">The Story of the Miao</span> he tells how he created what became known as the Pollard script:<blockquote>The Miao language is monosyllabic and in nearly all cases the vowels end the words. By adapting the system used in shorthand of putting the vowel marks in different positions by the side of the consonant signs, we found we could solve the problem. The signs for the consonants are larger than the vowel signs, and the position of the latter by the side of the former, gives the tone or musical note required. (Pollard, <span class="italic">The Story of the Miao</span>, 142&#150;3)</blockquote>Pollard set about translating the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, which he completed shortly before his death.<br>
<br>In June 1915 a missionary colleague, William Hudspeth, contracted typhoid. Pollard nursed him at Stonegateway and as Hudspeth began to recover Pollard himself was struck down with the disease. Years of self-giving service had drained his energy. He slowly deteriorated, and on 15 September sank into a coma and died. He was buried among his beloved Miao on a hill overlooking Stonegateway. He was survived by his wife.<br>
