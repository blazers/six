<span class="headword">Lyon,  Patrick</span>, first Lord Glamis  (<em>c.</em>1400&#150;1460), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of Sir John Lyon of Glamis (<i>c</i>.1377&#150;<i>c</i>.1435), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54274/', "Sir John Lyon (d. 1382)")</script>, whose marriage in 1376 to Princess Joanna Stewart, daughter of Robert II, was probably the making of his family. The younger Sir John appears infrequently on record, but is stated to have married his first cousin once removed Elizabeth Graham, younger daughter of Euphemia, countess palatine of Strathearn, and Sir Patrick Graham of Dundaff and Kincardine; as her parents are considered to have married <i>c</i>.1406, however, this is unlikely, unless it was a second marriage. Patrick Lyon, the eldest of Sir John's three sons, was a hostage for the ransom demanded for James I and remained in England between 1424 and 1427. He was knighted by 1440 and in 1445, being among the richest barons in the land, assumed one of the new peerage styles, which (after some typical early variants) was settled as Patrick, Lord Glamis. Following the collapse in the autumn of 1449 of the Livingston faction which had so dominated court politics since especially the mid-1440s, Glamis rose to prominence. From late 1449 he regularly witnessed crown charters, indicating that he was a fixed member of the king's daily council. His arrival at court was sealed by the marriage in early 1450 of his son and heir, Alexander, to Agnes, daughter of William, Lord Crichton, who was effectively now the power behind the throne. His royalist stance was probably influenced by an old feud between the Lyons and the Lindsays, earls of Crawford, the leading allies of the Douglases and the dominant family in Angus&#151;James Lindsay of Crawford had murdered Patrick Lyon's grandfather.<br>
<br>Glamis was master of the king's household from at the latest April 1450 until the end of 1451 and again from late 1454 to the middle of 1455. In the mid-1450s the king began to rely on his loyalty to assist in the exploitation of the crown's interests in the north. He acted as commissioner when crown lands were leased and was appointed keeper of the castles of Kildrummy and Kindrochit, both in Aberdeenshire, and Balvenie, Banffshire, for which he received fees. The family's main estates were in Angus, but Lord Glamis also possessed land in Stirlingshire, Perthshire, Aberdeenshire, Berwickshire, and Fife. He ceased to witness crown charters at the end of 1458, perhaps because of his activities in the north.<br>
<br>Glamis married Isabel (<i>c</i>.1410&#150;1485), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20602/', "Sir Walter Ogilvy of Lintrathen")</script>, about 1428; they had four sons and one daughter. He died on 21 March 1460 and was buried in Glamis kirk. His widow then married Gilbert, first Lord Kennedy (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1479). She is credited with finishing the building of the old castle at Glamis, as well as two stone bridges in the area and the aisle of the kirk where her first husband lay, and where she herself was buried after her death on 12 January 1485.<br>
<br>The eldest son of Patrick and Isabella, <a name="cosubject_54277"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Lyon</span>, second Lord Glamis  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1486?)<span class="occ"></span>, did not have as active a public life as his father. He succeeded to the keeperships of Kildrummy and Kindrochit castles, but was removed from office <i>c</i>.1462. He was a frequent auditor of causes in parliament (1468&#150;71, 1479&#150;85) and occasionally a lord of the king's council in judicial matters (1480&#150;84). He is said to have died in 1486. His marriage to Agnes Crichton was apparently childless. She married Walter Ker of Cessford (<i>d</i>. 1501) after October 1487 and died after July 1501. Alexander was succeeded by his brother <a name="cosubject_54278"></a><span class="headword">John Lyon</span>, third Lord Glamis  (<em>c.</em>1432&#150;1497)<span class="occ"></span>, who had already acted as an auditor of causes and lord of council in judicial matters. He was an unusual member of the nobility in being a graduate (possibly of the University of Paris). After the death of James III at Sauchieburn in 1488 John quickly established himself with the new administration; he was a constant witness of crown charters from 1489 to 1495 and also justiciar north of Forth, a regular auditor of causes, and lord of council. By April 1479 he married Elizabeth Scrymgeour (supposedly daughter of John Scrymgeour of Dudhope, constable of Dundee), who died before 20 October 1492. Glamis died on 1 April 1497 and was buried in Glamis kirk. Among their four sons and seven daughters was John, fourth Lord Glamis (<i>d</i>. 1500); his three brothers were killed at the battle of Flodden.<br>
