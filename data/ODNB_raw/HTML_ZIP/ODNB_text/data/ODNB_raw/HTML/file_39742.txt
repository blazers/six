<span class="headword">Aram,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1667, <em>d.</em> 1735), <span class="occ">gardener and writer</span>, was baptized on 13 October 1667, at Clifton, Nottinghamshire, the son and eldest of three children of Henry Aram, fisherman, and his second wife, Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1630), daughter of Thomas and Alice Westbrook of Lenton, Nottinghamshire. Little is known of Aram's childhood. His detailed knowledge of Clifton and nearby Wollaton Hall suggest he grew up in the area. As a young man he travelled to London to train as a gardener under George London, and worked for the bishop of London at Fulham Palace. By 1694 he had begun working as gardener to Sir Edward Blackett at Newby Hall, near Ripon, Yorkshire, and he remained there until Blackett's death in 1718. Thereafter he took employment with Sir John Ingilby of Ripley, Yorkshire, apparently in the role of steward (some account books of Ripley Castle appear to be in his hand). Aram had married into a substantial family from Ramsgill in Nidderdale within a few years of his arrival in Yorkshire, but nothing more is known of his wife. They had four children, the ill-starred <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/602/', "Eugene Aram (bap. 1704, d. 1759)")</script>, who was executed for murder, a daughter, Orinda, and two younger sons, Henry and Stephen. The family lived in Skelton upon Ure, near Newby, until about 1709, then moved to Bondgate, near Ripon.<br>
<br>Aram began writing in the 1720s. By 1723 he was planning the ambitious prose work that would become <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise of Flowers</span>, and in 1733 his most important poem, <span class="italic">Studley-Park</span>, was published in an anthology of local materials compiled by Thomas Gent. He died two years later and was buried on 10 June 1735, at Ripley parish church.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Studley-Park</span> has a minor place in literary history as a well-informed, eloquently turned contribution to the tradition of local descriptive poetry. The publication in 1985 of Aram's <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise of Flowers</span> adds substantially to his achievement. Its detailed advice on the cultivation of flowers is solidly based on first-hand experience and observation, and offers a valuable insight into early eighteenth-century gardening. Aram's training and employment brought him into contact with the latest ideas, particularly at Newby where he held a key role in developing the garden; his duties included a trip to the Netherlands early in 1696 to buy plants.<br>
<br>Aram seems to have been a modest and likeable man. His unpublished notebooks, containing poetry and prose, give some sense of his personality&#151;by turns practical, fanciful, pious, and humorous, but always omnivorous in his interests.<br>
