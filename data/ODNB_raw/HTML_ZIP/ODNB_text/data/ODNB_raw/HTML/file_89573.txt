<span class="headword">Eadie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hearn]</span>,  Ellice Aylmer</span>  (1912&#150;2001), <span class="occ">barrister and civil servant</span>, was born on 30 June 1912 at Edmonton, St Patrick's Hill, Cork, the daughter of Robert Thomas Hearn (<i>d</i>. 1952), Church of Ireland clergyman, later bishop of Cork, and his wife, Dr Mary Ellice Horn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cummins, a skin specialist, and the first woman in Ireland to become a fellow of the Irish Royal College of Physicians. An aunt was the first woman in Ireland to qualify as a professional engineer. The family was distinguished in sport, too: three of Ellice's aunts played, at the same time, for the Irish hockey team, and later a nephew, Dan Hearn, played rugby for England.<br>
<br>Ellice Hearn was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and in 1931 went to Oxford to read law at St Hugh's College. There being no law tutor at St Hugh's at that time, her moral tutor was Agnes Headlam-Morley, who later became the first woman to hold a full professorship at Oxford, the Montague Burton chair of international relations. Hearn was taught by some of the greatest academic lawyers of the generation. In his end-of-term report C. H. S. Fifoot described her as having first-class ability; H. G. Hanbury regarded her as &#145;really good&#146;, and Ivy Williams thought her &#145;painstaking and intelligent&#146;  (register, St Hugh's College, Oxford). In Michaelmas term 1933 she was awarded the Winter Williams law scholarship for women, and in 1934 graduated with a first-class degree in jurisprudence. She then embarked on the degree of bachelor of civil law, again being placed in the first class in 1935. In December 1935 she took the first part of the bar examination, being placed in the first class in constitutional law, legal history, and elements of the law of contract and of the law of tort; she was placed in the second class in criminal law and procedure. She was awarded a special prize of &pound;50 for the best examination in constitutional law and legal history. In June 1936 she was placed in the first class (second in order of merit) of the final bar examinations and was awarded the Lord Justice Holker senior scholarship (&pound;200 a year for three years). On 26 January 1937 she was called to the bar by Gray's Inn and was awarded the Arden scholarship of &pound;150 for three years. These were very significant distinctions at a time when very few women read law or were called to the bar.<br>
<br>Ellice Hearn commenced pupillage in 1937 with Milner Holland and R. G. Metcalfe, both of Lincoln's Inn, and she stayed on with Milner Holland as his &#145;devil&#146; when her pupillage was completed. She also gave tuition to women law students at Oxford during this period. Despite her distinction in qualifying for the bar, she did not achieve a tenancy, or perhaps did not seek one, but instead joined the office of parliamentary counsel in 1939. During this, her first spell of drafting, she became assistant to Harold Kent, later the Treasury solicitor. In his memoirs, <span class="italic">In on the Act</span> (1979), he recorded that, despite her academic record, &#145;she was astonishingly modest, even diffident&#146; and he praised her as &#145;a fellow professional at least as good as I was&#146;  (pp. 142&#150;3). She was the first woman lawyer to join the office of parliamentary counsel.<br>
<br>Ellice Hearn served in the WAAF from 1941 until leaving as a flight officer in 1946. Her wartime activities are unknown but some assumed that she worked for the intelligence services. She would have been an unlikely recruit to a fighting role. On 4 December 1946 she married John Harold Ward Eadie (1908/9&#150;1995), who was then working as a personnel officer for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, but who was later the director of a pet food company. Of Canadian descent, he was the son of Harold George Eadie, and the former husband of Edith Constance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parker. The marriage turned out to be a successful and happy, albeit an unlikely, one: he was a large man with a large jovial personality to match, interested in sport; she small and slightly built, well groomed but shy and retiring. They had no children, but they were a much loved aunt and uncle to her nephews and niece, and a favoured honorary aunt and uncle to the children of friends.<br>
<br>In 1946 Eadie joined the Board of Trade solicitor's department. She returned to the office of the parliamentary counsel in 1949. She was described as a thoroughly good person, and a fine lawyer and draftsman; she encouraged new recruits, including Edward Caldwell, later first parliamentary counsel. She was promoted to deputy counsel in 1956, thus becoming the first woman lawyer to reach under-secretary rank in the civil service, and was promoted further to become the first woman parliamentary counsel (deputy secretary rank) in 1968. She was appointed CBE in 1965.<br>
<br>Between 1960 and 1965 Eadie was heavily engaged in revising rules of court. She drafted the Supreme Court (general) rules in 1960 and by 1965 had produced the matrimonial causes (amendment) rules and revised the Supreme Court rules (the <span class="roman">White Book</span>). From 1965 to 1969 she was attached to the Law Commission, and thus found herself the architect of family-law reforms generated by the Labour government returned in 1964. These had been set out by Lord Gardiner, the new lord chancellor, in a book he had edited shortly before taking up office, <span class="italic">Law Reform Now</span> (1963). Among the family legislation she brought into being were the <span class="roman">Divorce Reform Act</span> 1969, which aimed to reform radically the law of divorce, and the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Homes Act</span> 1967, which protected the right of the non-owning wife to remain in the matrimonial home. She drafted the <span class="roman">Family Law Reform Act</span> 1969, which reduced the age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen and introduced blood testing to establish disputed paternity. She also drafted the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act</span> 1970 which introduced more generous support for the divorced spouse. After returning to parliamentary counsel's office in 1969 she worked on the <span class="roman">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</span> 1970, the <span class="roman">Highways, Licensing, and Attachment of Earnings Acts</span> 1971, and the <span class="roman">Superannuation, Affiliation Proceedings, and Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Acts</span> 1972. Her last project was the bill for the <span class="roman">Friendly Societies Act</span> 1974.<br>
<br>Always interested in the church, Eadie became involved in drafting church legislation when on her retirement in 1972 she was appointed standing counsel to the general synod, again a first for a woman. She was as greatly liked and respected in this later role as she had been as a parliamentary counsel. She drafted the ecclesiastical offices (age limits) measure of 1974, requiring Church of England bishops to retire at seventy, and the patronage (benefices) measure of 1976, which modernized the way in which incumbents were appointed. After retiring in 1978 she remained very busy, involved, as she had been all her life, in a range of church activities, keeping up with her wide circle of friends and family, and an active member, and at one time treasurer, of the New Cavendish Club in London. Widowed in 1995, she remained active, continuing to visit London and elsewhere from her flat in Hyde Street, Winchester, Hampshire. Becoming increasingly frail, she moved to the Flowerdown Nursing Home, 50 Harestock Road, Winchester, and died there peacefully of bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular disease on 31 March 2001. Because of her standing in draftsmanship at a time of radical law reform Eadie had unexpectedly become a champion of women seeking protection and freedom after failed marriages and a role model for other women in the law.<br>
