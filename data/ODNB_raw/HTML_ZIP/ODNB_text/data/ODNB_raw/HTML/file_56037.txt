<span class="headword">Mapp <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wallin]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1706, <em>d.</em> 1737), <span class="occ">bone-setter</span>, was baptized on 26 March 1706 at Hinton, near Chicklade, Wiltshire, the daughter of John Wallin and his wife, Jenny. She had a younger brother, Richard, and a sister who later acted the part of Polly Peachum in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. John Wallin, also a bone-setter, trained Sarah but instilled in her only the barest knowledge of anatomy. After a family quarrel she &#145;wander'd up and down the Country in a very miserable Manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 5.458), and scarcely made a living. Already eccentric in her ways, she dubbed herself Crazy Sally.<br>
<br>About 1735 Sarah found herself in Epsom, Surrey, a watering place with royal connections and a centre of fashionable society; the horse-racing there produced a useful crop of mangled bones. Still a young woman, she was beefy and endowed with unusual strength, which she used to gain an immediate reputation for righting dislocations and for setting fractures, even those of patients who had suffered for decades. Despite her slovenly appearance she was neat in her work, even down to the rolling of bandages. Treating each day a plentiful assortment of the injured, whom with great dispatch she sent on their way rejoicing, she was soon earning nearly 20 guineas a day; the well-to-do also lavished many presents on her. When a rumour spread that her services were to be poached elsewhere, some townspeople clubbed together and offered her 100 guineas to remain for another year.<br>
<br>Having acquired a four-horse chariot, in mid-1736 Sarah began to travel to London once a week. There, at the Grecian Coffee House near the Temple&#151;much frequented by lawyers&#151;she performed some noteworthy feats in the presence of Sir Hans Sloane, the physician. She straightened out the crooked back of Sloane's niece, and of a man from Wardour Street, who for nine years had gone about with his backbone projecting 2 inches out of true. There was even a man who, after an accident, had one leg 6 inches shorter than the other, which she restored to its correct length by manipulating his hip. When some disbelieving doctors tried to hoodwink her with a sound patient who pretended to have a damaged wrist, she angrily dislocated it and bade him go back and have it set by the fools who had sent him.<br>
<br>The <i>haut ton</i> of the capital, wild for amazing new cures to surpass those of earlier publicity-seeking quacks, took Sarah Wallin to its collective heart and, metaphorically, put out of joint the nose of the former idol Josiah Ward. Having taken a London residence, in August 1736 at All Hallows, London Wall, Sarah married Hill Mapp (<i>b</i>. 1708), from Hopesay, Shropshire, who was a footman to Ebenezer Ibbetson, a mercer of Salisbury Court in London's Fleet Street. Given Sarah's unprepossessing appearance, Mapp was assumed to have married for money; sure enough, within two weeks he had decamped, robbing her of more than 100 guineas. A month later the <span class="italic">Grub-Street Journal</span>, pursuing its relentless crusade against medical impostors of all kinds, began to ridicule her. It gleefully noted that she had given a plate worth 10 guineas to a race at Epsom, which had been won by a mare named Mrs Mapp, while a still disabled ex-patient indignantly rebuffed claims that he had been cured by her. These reports did not prevent her from being graciously received by Queen Caroline at Kensington.<br>
<br>In October, Sarah Mapp was brazen enough to appear with the itinerant oculist John Taylor (1703&#150;1772) at the Playhouse Theatre, Lincoln's Inn Fields, to see a topical comedy entitled <span class="italic">The Husband's Relief, with the Female Bone-Setter and Worm Doctor</span>. A packed house cheered an ironic finale, sung from the stage, on her exploits. Sarah Mapp's conduct now became more and more indecorous. In December 1736, when passing through the Old Kent Road in her chariot, she was waylaid by a crowd who mistook her, in her <i>robe-de-chambre</i>, for one of George II's detested German mistresses. &#145;Damn your bloods,&#146; she expostulated, &#145;don't you know me?&#146; Bawling her name she drove off to loud huzzas.<br>
<br>Although Sarah showed up the poor grasp of bone manipulation among medical men of the day, she was very widely dismissed as a figure of no great consequence, and the general public soon tired of her. It was William Hogarth who gave a push to her downward spiral by featuring her in his print of March 1737, <span class="italic">The Company of Undertakers</span>. Above a group of twelve physicians were John Taylor, Josiah Ward, and Sarah Mapp. She was depicted as bun-faced, distinctly boss-eyed and double-chinned, and holding a bone. Her mannishness was emphasized by a hat at a rakish angle and being referred to as &#145;he&#146;, her substantial bulk being covered by a harlequin costume. After this savage satire her name disappeared from the press, and she became a heavy drinker, hardly ever sobering up. Sarah Mapp died on 10 December 1737 in her lodgings at Seven Dials, London, &#145;miserably poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 6.705), so that she had to be buried at the parish's expense. Too unselfconscious, rumbustious, and disorganized to strive for the highest ranks of charlatanism, she fell victim to the fickleness of those who raised her up to fame and riches and as abruptly dropped her for fresh wonders and sensations.<br>
