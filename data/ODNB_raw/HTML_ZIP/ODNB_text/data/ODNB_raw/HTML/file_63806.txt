<span class="headword">Eichholz,  Alfred</span>  (1869&#150;1933), <span class="occ">medical inspector of schools</span>, was born at 196 Wilmslow Road, Fallowfield, Manchester, on 26 November 1869, the son of Adolph Eichholz, cotton merchant, formerly of Hildesheim and Hanover, and his wife, Babet Praeger of Amsterdam. He was educated at Manchester grammar school and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he gained first-class honours in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1891, 1892).<br>
<br>After graduating Eichholz published two papers on the palate process of the maxilla and the morphology of the limb arteries in the <span class="italic">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</span> in 1892 and 1893 respectively. In 1893 he was elected to a fellowship at Emmanuel, becoming one of the first Jews to hold a fellowship at a Cambridge college. He married on 26 June 1895 Ruth Adler, the younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30343/', "Hermann Adler (1839&#150;1911)")</script>, the chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire, and they were to have three sons. In 1894 the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> commented that his engagement to the chief rabbi's daughter &#145;evidences anew the growing importance attached in Jewish circles in England&#151;as it has long been abroad&#151;to professional as distinct from commercial distinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 5 Oct 1894, 6). After a period as a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, he graduated MB BCh at Cambridge in 1895 and was an additional demonstrator in the department of physiology at Cambridge. He declined to pursue an academic career and, gaining his Cambridge MD degree in 1898, he took up a post as one of her majesty's inspectors of schools in the same year.<br>
<br>Eichholz had a particular interest in the impact of economic and social conditions on the health of children, and in the effect of health on educational performance. In 1902 he compiled a brief report for the Board of Education on the education of &#145;feeble-minded&#146; children in Germany  (&#145;Report of the congress on the education of feeble-minded children&#146;, <span class="italic">Special Reports on Educational Subjects</span>, vol. 9, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1902, 27, Cd 836), and in 1903 he wrote a report on the physical condition of children attending the Johanna Street board school in Lambeth in south London  (&#145;Note on physical condition of London children in poorer districts&#146;, TNA: PRO, PC8/584). This report played a major role in the discussions which preceded the establishment of the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration, and Eichholz's evidence to the committee exercised a decisive influence on its final recommendations. When the committee was first appointed it was widely believed that the unhealthy effects of town life were leading to a &#145;hereditary deterioration&#146; in the health of the working-class population. Eichholz's evidence helped to persuade the committee that &#145;while there are, unfortunately, very abundant signs of physical defect traceable to neglect, poverty and ignorance&#146;, there was no evidence to show that these possessed any marked hereditary effect, and so &#145;there is every reason to anticipate rapid amelioration of physique so soon as improvement occurs in external conditions&#146;  (&#145;Report of the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1904, 32, para. 69). Among the many recommendations of the physical deterioration committee, one of the most important concerned the imposition of &#145;a systematised medical inspection of schoolchildren &hellip; as a public duty on every school authority&#146;  (ibid., para. 423, section 41), and in 1907 parliament passed the <span class="roman">Education (Administrative Provisions) Act</span>, which instructed every local education authority to make arrangements for the medical inspection of elementary schoolchildren, and gave them the power to make arrangements for medical treatment.<br>
<br>In view of his experience of working in schools, Eichholz might have been expected to become the board's first chief medical officer, but the government was anxious to ensure the closest possible co-ordination between the school medical service and the existing public health service, and the new post was offered to Dr George Newman, the medical officer of health for Finsbury. Eichholz was appointed with Newman, and these two, together with Dr Ralph Crowley (1869&#150;1953) and Dr Janet Campbell (1877&#150;1954), were largely responsible for the development of the school medical service before the First World War. During the war Eichholz also carried out a major survey of the health conditions of munitions workers, for which he was made CBE in January 1919. Later in the same year, when Newman became chief medical officer of the Ministry of Health as well as of the Board of Education, Eichholz was promoted to the post of chief medical inspector, a post which he continued to hold until his retirement in 1930.<br>
<br>In retirement Eichholz wrote a major report on the problems faced by deaf people in England and Wales  (<span class="italic">A Study of the Deaf in England and Wales, 1930 to 1932</span>, 1933). He urged local education authorities to improve their arrangements for the early detection of hearing problems, and highlighted the importance of vocational training in giving deaf people the skills needed to maintain financial independence. He also called on the government to improve the provision of secondary education for deaf and deaf mute people, pointing out that &#145;there is, at present, no body of highly-educated deaf persons in the country such as would be able to voice the cause of the deaf and dumb with adequate effect from within&#146;  (p. 177). His report was granted the unusual distinction of being published under his own name, and was cited approvingly in two Board of Education circulars (nos. 1337 and 1337a) published in the following year.<br>
<br>Eichholz was heavily involved in educational and philanthropic work in the Jewish community. His wife, Ruth, had been actively engaged in social work in the East End of London before their marriage, and she went on to become a prominent social worker in her own right. Eichholz himself became president of the East End Social Club for Jewish Deaf and Dumb in 1912, before becoming vice-president of the Jewish Health Organisation of Great Britain and chairman of the New West End Synagogue League of Social Service. Shortly after Eichholz's death, the chief rabbi, Dr J. H. Hertz, wrote that &#145;aside from his eminent educational labours in the service of the state, it is Jewish religious education that commanded his utmost devotion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 10 Feb 1933, 12). Eichholz was chairman of the Central Committee for Jewish Education, president of the Union of Hebrew and Religion Classes, and a vice-president of the Jewish Religious Education Board. He was actively involved in local religious activities, including the Hampstead and West Ham religion classes and the West Ham Talmud Torah, and he was a past president of the Palestine Society and a member of the Maccabeans. He was also a founder member of the National Special Schools Union.<br>
<br>Eichholz died at his home, 26 North End House, Fitzjames Avenue, North End Road, London, on 6 February 1933, and was buried on 8 February at Willesden cemetery. He was survived by his wife. In March 1933 the national institutes of the blind and the deaf, the Scottish Association for the Deaf, and the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind launched a national appeal to raise funds in his memory. He was also commemorated by the establishment of the Alfred Eichholz Memorial Clinic and Institute of Massage and Physiotherapy in July 1934.<br>
