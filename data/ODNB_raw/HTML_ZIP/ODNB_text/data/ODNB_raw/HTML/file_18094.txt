<span class="headword">Marriott,  Wharton Booth</span>  (1823&#150;1871), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, seventh son of George Wharton Marriott (1777/8&#150;1833), barrister and magistrate at the Westminster police court, and his wife, Selina Anne, only child of Revd Fitzherbert Adams of Charwelton, Northamptonshire, and rector of Ulcombe, Kent, was born at 32 Queen Square, Bloomsbury, London, on 7 November 1823. Following the death of his father, friends paid for his education at Eton College, 1838&#150;43. He was a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, from 1843 to 1846, and an officer of the Union Society after taking a second in classics in 1847. He graduated BCL in 1851, MA in 1856, and BD in 1870. He was elected a Petrean fellow of Exeter College on 30 June 1846, but vacated his fellowship by marrying, on 22 April 1851, at Bletchingley, Surrey, Julia, youngest daughter of his godfather William Soltau of Clapham.<br>
<br>Marriott was ordained in 1849 by Bishop Wilberforce and intended to serve in Little Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, but instead took up an appointment as assistant master at Eton in 1850. He never held any benefice, but was a preacher by licence from the bishop in the diocese of Oxford. In 1853 he became a housemaster. He also found time for ministerial work among the poor, holding mission services on a Thames barge for those who would not go into a church. Marriott was on the board of guardians and worked for the Society for Improving the Dwellings of the Poor.<br>
<br>Marriott was influenced by his cousin, Charles Marriott, a fellow of Oriel and vicar of St Mary's and a leader in the Oxford Movement, but was not himself a party man. In 1865 the ritual controversy led him to the question of ecclesiastical ceremony and vestments. He published his opinions in <span class="italic">Vestiarium Christianum: the origin and gradual development of the dress of holy ministry in the church</span> (1868) and other works. In 1857&#150;9 he wrote a series of letters on the eucharist in the <span class="italic">Clerical Journal</span>, and his correspondence with a friend, Revd Thomas Thellusson Carter, rector of Clewer, originating from the declaration issued in Oxford in 1866, was published in two parts, 1868&#150;9.<br>
<br>Marriott enjoyed the study of language and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He planned and partly prepared a critical concordance to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in 1863. This was later set aside in favour of his antiquarian researches. He edited selections from Ovid and was a contributor to Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</span>. On 30 May 1857 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a member of the council in 1871. After his resignation from Eton in 1860 due to ill health, Marriott became absorbed in his literary work and in preaching in his neighbouring church. He became select preacher in Oxford in 1868 and Grinfield lecturer on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> in 1871. Marriott delivered only one of these lectures, and, before he was able to take up his appointment as Bampton lecturer, died at Eton College on 16 December 1871. His funeral was conducted on 21 December by the dean of Windsor. His wife died in April of the following year.<br>
