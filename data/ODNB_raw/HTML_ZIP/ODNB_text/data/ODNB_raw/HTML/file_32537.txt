<span class="headword">Conybeare,  Frederick Cornwallis</span>  (1856&#150;1924), <span class="occ">biblical and Armenian scholar</span>, was born at Coulsdon, Surrey, on 14 September 1856, the third son of John Charles Conybeare (1818/19&#150;1884), barrister, of Coulsdon, and his wife, Mary Catharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vansittart. He was educated at Tonbridge School from 1868 to 1876 (his father having moved to Tonbridge), and in January 1876 he proceeded with a scholarship to University College, Oxford; he obtained a first class in classical moderations (1877), and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1879), and graduated BA (1880) and MA (1882). He was elected fellow of his college in 1880 and was made praelector in philosophy and, for one year only, in ancient history. On 12 December 1883 he married Mary Emily (1862&#150;1886), second daughter of Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller, the philologist; she accompanied him on his travels and assisted him in translating R. H. Lotze's <span class="italic">Outlines of a Philosophy of Religion</span> (1892). He married secondly, in Nice on 22 January 1888, Jane (1859/60&#150;1934), daughter of Edward Macdowell of Belfast; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Possessing a private income Conybeare was able to resign his college appointments in 1887 and to devote himself to research, studying, at the suggestion of a friend, the Armenian language (and later also Georgian). At first he gathered material for the textual criticism of Greek classics from ancient Armenian versions, and he published <span class="italic">Collation with the Ancient Armenian Versions of the Greek Text of Aristotle's Categories</span> (1892) along with various articles, mainly in the American <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> (1889&#150;1924), dealing with the text of Plato. He also produced comments on and translations of other Greek authors. Conybeare also travelled to various places where there were collections of Armenian manuscripts, and this literature being mainly religious he became interested in church history and in the textual criticism of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. The former study was one in which members of his family&#151;notably Bishop John Conybeare and William John Conybeare&#151;had previously won distinction. He made numerous discoveries, of which the most notable was the ascription to the &#145;Presbyter Aristion&#146; of the last twelve verses of <span class="roman">St Mark's gospel</span> in a manuscript in the monastery library at Echmiadzin, Transcaucasia. In a Viennese manuscript he discovered a translation of textual importance of the commentary of Ephrem of Syria on <span class="roman">Acts</span>. In the library of the holy synod in Moscow he unearthed <span class="italic">The Key of Truth</span>, the sole surviving monument of the Eastern Paulicians, in whose doctrines he became interested. He also brought to light from Armenian and Georgian printed books and manuscripts numerous documents bearing on the history of early Christianity and its sects, and on general biblical and patristic literature. He was employed to catalogue the Armenian manuscripts in the British Museum (the catalogue was published in 1913) and the Bodleian Library, Oxford (catalogue published in 1918). He became FBA (1903) and honorary LLD of St Andrews (1913).<br>
<br>The frankness with which Conybeare expressed his opinions endeared him to his friends but involved him in controversies. Having obtained private information about the Dreyfus affair Conybeare published in 1898 his much noticed pro-Dreyfus book, <span class="italic">The Dreyfus Case</span>. In 1904 he joined the Rationalist Press Association, which published his <span class="italic">Myth, Magic, and Morals, a Study of Christian Origins</span> (1909); its somewhat cynical scepticism elicited a rejoinder from William Sanday in <span class="italic">A New Marcion</span> (1909). But Conybeare also attacked the rationalist school, which denied the historicity of Jesus Christ, in <span class="italic">The Historical Christ</span>, published by the same association in 1914. John MacKinnon Robertson, a leading writer of that school, was also a prominent member of the association, which Conybeare left in 1915, presumably because of the controversy evoked by his book.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of war in 1914 Conybeare, against the advice of friends, wrote a letter in reply to Professor Kuno Meyer in which he blamed the outbreak of war on Sir Edward Grey and H. H. Asquith. Meyer, then in New York, published it in 1915, despite a request from Conybeare not to do so. The affair brought on Conybeare criticism from the British press and alienated many of his friends. In 1917 he sold his Oxford house, and in 1921 he took one at Folkestone, though still spending much time overseas. In 1919 he visited the United States to deliver the Lowell lectures at Harvard. He died at his home, 21 Trinity Gardens, Folkestone, Kent, on 9 January 1924, and was buried four days later at Golders Green. His valuable collection of Armenian books was given after his death to the London Library.<br>
