<span class="headword">Weston,  Stephen</span>  (1665&#150;1742), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, probably the son of Stephen Weston, a farmer, was born at Farnborough, Berkshire, on 25 December 1665. In 1679 he was admitted to Eton College, and in 1683 he matriculated as a scholar of King's College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1687 and proceeded MA in 1690, and BD and DD (Oxon) in 1711. Weston was elected a fellow of King's in 1686, and admitted to Gray's Inn on 20 December 1692. He became an assistant master at Eton in 1690, and lower master or usher in 1693. In 1707 he retired from teaching, apparently on grounds of ill health, and was elected a fellow of Eton. He was vice-provost from 1721 to 1725. Thomas Sherlock reckoned him an able classical scholar, and a hardworking and successful schoolmaster. At Eton his name became associated with the former stable yard because he lived in a house in the yard.<br>
<br>Weston was ordained deacon on 29 September 1707, and priest on 5 October 1707 by the bishop of London. In 1710 he intended to stand for the provostship of King's in opposition to Dr John Adams. To qualify for this he needed to hold a DD degree. As it was suspected that this might be resisted by friends of Adams at Cambridge he incorporated at New College, Oxford, and proceeded BD and DD there. Hearne called Weston &#145;a good scholar and a good-natured man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 3.277&#150;8). Weston married Lucy, daughter of Dr Richard Sleech, assistant master and fellow of Eton, and sister of Dr Stephen Sleech, provost of Eton (1746&#150;65). She died on 4 March 1742, and was buried with her husband. They had three sons and two daughters. Their second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29119/', "Edward Weston")</script>, civil servant and author. Weston was a canon of Ely from 1715, and vicar of Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, from 1716. In 1724, through the influence of Sir Robert Walpole, whom he had taught at Eton, he was appointed bishop of Exeter. The bishopric was poorly endowed, and to supplement his income he held <i>in commendam</i> the rectories of Calstock in Cornwall and Shobrooke in Devon, the treasurership and a prebendal stall in Exeter Cathedral, and, from 1732, the archdeaconry of Exeter. He was unusual among eighteenth-century bishops in conducting all his ordinations in Exeter, occasionally, in his early years, in the cathedral, but mostly in the palace chapel. He seems to have spent most of his time in Exeter, rarely attending the House of Lords. He undertook an extensive visitation of Devon in 1726 and Cornwall in 1728, in the course of which he visited and confirmed in most of the main local centres in the diocese. An anonymous verse notes<blockquote>
<div>In Honour's Paths in Dubious Times he Trod<br>
</div>
<div>Firm to his Prince, as faithful to his God,<br>
</div>
<div>By Courts prefer'd yet not to Courts a Slave,<br>
</div>
<div>(Good men approved of what grateful Walpole gave)<br>
</div>
<div>Humane of Temper, Though his look Severe,<br>
</div>
<div>Cautious of Speech, in Promise as Sincere.<br>
</div> (Weston, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, vol. 1, Exeter Cathedral Library copy, MS sheet initialled &#145;R.W.&#146;)</blockquote>Weston was reputed to be rather too schoolmasterly towards his clergy, &#145;who were much dissatisfied with him upon that account, as also upon his rough and ill-hewn manner of behaviour&#146;  (Hollis, 119). Sherlock noted &#145;the best Greek and Roman Writers were so familiar to him, that it leads him frequently into their Manner of Construction and Expression, which will require, sometime the Attention of the English Reader&#146;  (Weston, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, vii).<br>
<br>During his final years at Exeter he was incapacitated by ill health, and unable to travel. He died at the bishop's palace, Exeter, on 8 January 1742, and was buried in the south aisle choir of Exeter Cathedral, where he is commemorated by a mural monument.<br>
