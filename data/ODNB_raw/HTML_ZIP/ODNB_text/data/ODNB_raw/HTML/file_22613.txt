<span class="headword">Potter,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1734?, <em>d.</em> after 1813?), <span class="occ">writer and composer</span>, born in London, was probably the son of the John Potter from Kent who was vicar of Cloford, Somerset, and author of works on mathematics and theology. He was probably also related to the family of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22612/', "John Potter (1673/4&#150;1747)")</script>, archbishop of Canterbury. Potter is said to have received a good classical education; he &#145;studied mathematics and physic principally with his father, and afterwards made some progress in the science of music&#146;  (Baker, Reed, and Jones, 1.578). Baker claims that he published some poems at the age of twenty in 1754. About two years later he settled in the west country, and at Exeter in 1756 established a weekly paper, the <span class="italic">Devonshire Inspector</span>. When he returned to London he read the music lecture at Gresham College in the Easter and Trinity terms of 1761. He was not appointed to a professorship but the substance of the lectures was published in Potter's <span class="italic">Observations on the present state of music and musicians &hellip;; to which is added a scheme for erecting and supporting a musical academy in this kingdom</span> (1762). His advocacy of the professional training of musicians, one of the earliest proposals of its kind, attracted favourable comment from the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>.<br>
<br>Potter wrote the music for the pantomime <span class="italic">The Rites of Hecate</span> (Drury Lane, December 1763) and probably contributed music to <span class="italic">Hymen</span>, written to celebrate the marriage of Princess Augusta to the prince of Brunswick (Drury Lane, January 1764). He was also responsible for the text of <span class="italic">The Choice of Apollo</span>, a serenata, with music by William Yates (Haymarket, March 1765). At this period he became acquainted with David Garrick and this connection with the theatre led to his writing a number of dramatic prologues and epilogues. Through Garrick's patronage, Potter was introduced to Jonathan Tyers, the proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens. For the entertainments there Potter wrote &#145;several hundreds of songs, ballads, cantatas, &amp;c&#146;  (Baker, Reed, and Jones, 1.578). Collections of these Vauxhall songs were published annually between 1765 and 1774 (with the possible exception of 1770). Potter's connection with Vauxhall lasted until some conflict with Tyers's successors led to his resignation in 1777.<br>
<br>Potter also quarrelled rather more publicly. In November 1766, as theatrical critic of the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span>, he attacked Garrick's managerial style in an anonymous piece entitled &#145;The Rosciad, or, A Theatrical Register&#146;. Garrick found out and an angry correspondence ensued, in which Potter threatened to publish a statement on the subject and claimed that Garrick had slandered him to his employer Tyers as &#145;a <i>Bad &amp; Dangerous</i> Man&#146;. Garrick denied all allegations and reminded his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;: &#145;I had a Regard for you and always Shew'd it when in my power. You best know if You have return'd it in a proper manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.550). Potter did not allow matters to rest and outlined his side of the case in <span class="italic">The Hobby Horse</span> (1766), cast in Hudibrastic verse. Another victim of Potter's published satire was J. A. Fisher, who, after a quarrel over the music to the latter's oratorio <span class="italic">Providence</span> (1777), duly appeared as the main target in <span class="italic">Music in Mourning, or, Fiddlestick in the Suds</span> (1780).<br>
<br>Potter's theatrical criticisms for 1771&#150;2 were collected and published under the title <span class="italic">The Theatrical Review, or, A New Companion to the Playhouse</span> (2 vols., 1772). These pieces, ostensibly written by &#145;a Society of Gentlemen Independent of Managerial influence&#146; (but actually by Potter himself), constitute a valuable, because almost complete, record of the performances at Drury Lane and Covent Garden that season. Other works which Potter published at this period include <span class="italic">The Words of the Wise</span> (1768); a modernized and expurgated version (1768) of Edmund Gayton's venerable <span class="italic">Festivous Notes on Don Quixote</span>; and the first examples of his comic novels, <span class="italic">The History and Adventure of Arthur O'Bradley</span> (1769) and <span class="italic">The Curate of Coventry</span> (1771).<br>
<br>Potter went to Europe about 1780, possibly for financial reasons, at about the time that his membership of the Royal Society of Musicians (of which he had been a member since 1771) lapsed through non-payment of his annual fees. Baker asserts that while away Potter was retained as a government spy. On his return to Britain three more novels were published: <span class="italic">The Virtuous Villagers</span> (1784), <span class="italic">The Favourites of Felicity</span> (1785), and <span class="italic">Frederic, or, The Libertine</span> (1790). Potter's life at this time is uncertain but at this stage he seems to have made a radical career change by studying medicine and to have graduated MD at Edinburgh. (A short thesis, apparently his, entitled <span class="italic">Dissertatio medica inauguralis, quaedam de sedentariae vitae malis, amplectens</span>, Edinburgh, 1784, is listed in the <span class="italic">Eighteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue</span>.) He was admitted subsequently as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, on 30 September 1785, when he was described as a native of Oxfordshire. He is said to have practised at Enniscorthy, Ireland. Potter left about the time of the 1798 uprising and returned to London, where he is perhaps to be identified with the John Potter of 47 Albemarle Street, author of <span class="italic">Thoughts Respecting the Origin of Treasonable Conspiracies, &amp;c</span> (1803). A final novel, published as by John Potter MD, was <span class="italic">Olivia, or, The Nymph of the Valley</span> (1813).<br>
<br>Potter's biographer in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> confessed that aspects of his life were &#145;contradictory and confusing&#146;. He remains something of a puzzle, especially after 1780, and the possibility that he has been muddled with at least one other John Potter who published in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries cannot be dismissed. Modern bibliographies and library catalogues tend to list him under two or three different headings: as musician, physician (or surgeon), and by his Albemarle Street address. According to Reuss, Potter was author of <span class="italic">A Journal of a Tour through Parts of Germany, Holland, and France</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise on Pulmonary Inflammation</span> (both undated). Potter was evidently an industrious updater of several standard reference works, including Thomas Salmon's <span class="italic">The Modern Gazetteer</span> (9th edn, 1773) and Ogilby's and Morgan's important seventeenth-century survey of roads which he published as <span class="italic">The Traveller's Pocket-Book</span> (17th edn, 1775; with several further editions, up to at least 1780). Some of Potter's songs, mostly pastoral in character, appeared in <span class="italic">The Spinnet, or, Musical Miscellany</span> (1750), occasionally in the <span class="italic">Universal</span> and <span class="italic">London</span> magazines, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (between 1767 and 1770), and in <span class="italic">Polyhymnia, or, The Complete Song Book</span> (1769). He died probably some time after 1813.<br>
