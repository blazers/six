<span class="headword">Manton, Sir  Edwin Alfred Grenville</span>  (1909&#150;2005), <span class="occ">insurance underwriter, art collector, and philanthropist</span>, was born on 22 January 1909 at Burrows Road, Earls Colne, Essex, the eldest of three children of John Horace Manton, bank clerk, later bank manager, and his wife, Emily Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Denton. His father was descended from a miller in Grantham, Lincolnshire, two of whose brothers were the celebrated gunsmiths John and Joseph Manton. At the time of Manton's birth his parents lived in Stoke Newington, but a few months later the family moved to Westcliff-on-Sea, at the mouth of the Thames estuary, a location that gave him a lifelong affection for expanses of water and sky. Eight years later, while his father was temporarily serving in the army in Egypt, his uncle Edwin, alarmed by the number of German air raids on the Thames, moved the family including his younger sister, Phyllis, and brother, Paul, to the safety of Shaftesbury, Dorset. On his father's demobilization the family moved again to Hampstead, London, but Manton was by then enrolled at Shaftesbury grammar school and stayed on as a boarder. At school he excelled at languages, and being a tall and athletic figure played for the school in both the cricket and football teams.<br>
<br>In 1926 Manton won a scholarship to Cambridge University, but decided in favour of adventure and financial security and followed his uncle's introduction to B. W. Noble, the Paris agent of the Caledonian Insurance Company. Years later, in his late eighties, Manton would continue to astonish young executives with his command of idiomatic French. By 1933 he had been spotted by George Moskowski and the legendary Cornelius Vander Starr and had been invited to join the small American International Underwriters Corporation, then employing thirteen staff, as a casualty underwriter. In rapid succession he gained an American wife, Florence Vivian (Gretchen) Brewer (1911&#150;2003), whom he married on 20 January 1936, a daughter, Diana Harborough (<i>b</i>. 1938), and a swift series of promotions within the company. He became a vice-president in 1938 and served as president (1942&#150;69), chairman (1969&#150;75), and finally as a senior adviser to the parent group, American International Group Inc. (AIG), until his death. During his most influential years the company grew to a force of 50,000 people and Manton became a leading figure in the American insurance business. He was devoted to the &#145;firm&#146;, as he called it, and to its employees, frequently declining invitations to society events so that he could attend company retirement parties or the annual company picnic. He continued to work well into his nineties and was still walking to the office every day until shortly before his death. His tall, spare frame made him an impressive figure, even at an advanced age, but his acute mind and deep curiosity coupled with a twinkling smile won the affection of generations of his colleagues.<br>
<br>Although Manton had moved to New York in 1933, he retained his British citizenship until his death and throughout his life he retained a strong affection for the country and in particular the county of his birth. In 1939 he had returned to London and volunteered for service but was rejected on medical grounds, having suffered from Stokes-Adams disease. He was unable to return for a further eight years, but during the war he developed an interest in the paintings of John Constable and in 1949 he acquired at auction in New York his first &#145;Constable&#146;, <span class="italic">View on the Stour</span>. Over the next twenty years he slowly assembled one of the best collections of early nineteenth-century British paintings and drawings in private hands, buying in New York and on regular visits to London, but facing stiff competition from the dominant buyer in the market at that time, Paul Mellon. Shortly after the 1976 bicentenary Constable exhibition in London, Manton was introduced to Leslie Parris, deputy keeper of the British collection of the Tate Gallery. During the 1970s Constable scholars had begun to distinguish between the works of John Constable, his son Lionel, and followers, and when Parris informed Manton that many of his works, including his first purchase, were not by the master himself Manton characteristically accepted that this had been a small price to pay for the pleasure and education that his collection had brought him, and he renamed his &#145;mistakes&#146; as &#145;Constabiles&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1987 his growing friendship with Parris encouraged Manton to make a generous contribution to an appeal for funds to acquire Constable's <span class="italic">The Opening of Waterloo Bridge</span> for the Tate Gallery. Shortly afterwards he made a gift of AIG shares that established the American Fund for the Tate Gallery with an endowment of $6.5 million in 1988. In creating a fund that would respond to the Tate's wish to strengthen its collection of American art, he was giving expression both to his affection for his birthplace and to his enthusiasm for the culture and values of his adopted country. By the time of his death the fund had grown to nearly $30 million and with his encouragement had broadened its remit to acquire major works by three generations of American artists and had laid the ground for a serious collection of Latin American art in London. Manton's further gifts to the Tate in 1992 and 1997 were the cornerstones for the centenary development which opened on Millbank in 2001 with a new entrance, named the Manton Entrance in his honour. Taken together, Manton's benefactions were by far the most generous gift in the history of the Tate. Manton (known by his friends in England as Jim and in America as Jimmy) was knighted for his services to art and to the Tate Gallery in the new year's honours of 1994.<br>
<br>Following Manton's death in New York on 1 October 2005 the majority of his considerable wealth, estimated by the press as &pound;260 million in 2004, passed to the Manton Foundation, which he and Gretchen had established in 1991 in order to support institutions and causes in the church, medicine, and the arts that were the preoccupations of the Mantons in their lifetime. The Manton collection of early nineteenth-century British art was given by his family to the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts, in June 2007.<br>
