<span class="headword">Somerville,  William</span>  (1771&#150;1860), <span class="occ">military surgeon</span>, eldest son of the Presbyterian minister and historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26025/', "Thomas Somerville (1741&#150;1830)")</script> and his wife, Martha, daughter of Samuel Charters, was born at Minto, Roxburghshire, on 22 April 1771. He trained as a surgeon, entered the army as a hospital assistant on 25 March 1795, accompanied the expedition of Sir James Henry Craig to the Cape of Good Hope in 1795, and was appointed garrison surgeon of Cape Town on its capture by the British. He was employed on confidential missions by the government in the negotiation of treaties with the Xhosa peoples, who continued to make inroads on the farms of the Dutch colonists. In the course of his wanderings, he and his native guide were at one time sentenced to death by a chief, and owed their lives to the intercession of the chief's wife. During an interval in his African travels Somerville graduated as doctor of medicine in the University of Aberdeen, on 27 June 1800. His longest and most important journey was undertaken in 1801&#150;2, as co-commissioner with John Tr&uuml;ter, member of the court of justice, for the Cape government, to negotiate the purchase of cattle from the tribes of the interior, to replace those lost by the colonists in the Cape Frontier War. The expedition reached Lithako, the kraal of the Batlapin people, 700 miles from their starting point, and 300 from the frontier of the colony, in a region then rarely visited by Europeans. The journey is described in an appendix to Sir John Barrow's <span class="italic">Voyage to Cochin China</span> (1806).<br>
<br>Somerville accompanied Sir James Craig on his expedition to the Mediterranean, part of the operations against Napoleon in 1805. When failing health compelled Craig to resign his command at the end of a year, during which Naples and Sicily had been successively occupied, Somerville returned to England with him, and was again on Craig's staff when his partial recovery enabled the latter to go out to Canada as governor-in-chief in 1807. The post of inspector-general of hospitals in Canada was held by Somerville, together with the comptrollership of the customs in Quebec, until 1811, when he returned to England with his chief, and remained in attendance on him until Craig's death in February 1812. His prospects abroad were renounced for a home appointment on his marriage, in 1812, to his cousin, Mrs Greig, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fairfax, who became better known as the scientist and mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26024/', "Mary Somerville (1780&#150;1872)")</script>; they had two daughters, Martha and Mary.<br>
<br>After holding for a short time the post of deputy inspector of hospitals at Portsmouth, Somerville became in 1813 head of the army medical department in Scotland, and resided in Edinburgh until his appointment in 1816 as one of the principal inspectors of the army medical board in England, when he moved to London. Admitted LRCP on 27 June 1817, he was elected FRS on 11 December, and, on 13 November 1819, gazetted physician to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. His serious illness in 1838 compelled his family to winter abroad, and from then to live mainly on the continent. He died suddenly at Casa Capponi, Florence, on 25 June 1860, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery at Florence. A man of considerable endowments, Somerville shared the scientific interests as well as the social success of his wife, and after his marriage seemed to merge all personal ambition in the interest of her career.<br>
