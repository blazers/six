<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collins,  Josephine <span class="st"> [Jos&eacute;]</span></span>  (1887&#150;1958), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born on 23 May 1887 in Whitechapel, London, the illegitimate daughter of Joseph Van den Berg, a professor of music, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59294/', "Charlotte Louisa (Lottie) Collins (1865&#150;1910)")</script>, an actress, singer, and dancer. Lottie Collins was a flamboyantly successful music-hall artist who popularized the song &#145;Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay&#146;, which she had heard first in America and then introduced to London at the Tivoli music-hall in the Strand during October 1891, accompanied by her own dance. One of Jos&eacute; Collins's earliest memories was of imitating this at a tea party at home.<br>
<br>Jos&eacute; had successively two stepfathers, the first Stephen Patrick Cooney, and the second James W. Tate (<i>d</i>. 1922), a composer of light music. In the haphazard early chapters of her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains: her Story</span> (1932), she describes herself as having been born Josephine Charlotte Cooney in May 1893 in Salford.<br>
<br>The facts of Collins's life become clearer after her professional stage d&eacute;but. She appeared at a Glasgow music-hall with Harry Lauder, illustrating his song &#145;I Love a Lassie&#146; by doing a toe-dance in a tartan frock and glengarry as the &#145;little Scottish bluebell&#146;. Soon after this, at the age of seventeen, by then with a contralto voice and already a strikingly confident stage presence, she was engaged in a touring company performing George Dance's <span class="italic">A Chinese Honeymoon</span> (music by Howard Talbot) and later took the leading part of Mrs Pineapple: in her book she speaks of herself as &#145;fourteen and a half and the baby of the company&#146;  (Collins, 41). At Christmas 1905 she was back with Lauder in a Glasgow pantomime, <span class="italic">Aladdin</span>. She had a variety of work in the years that followed, in the music-halls, in touring companies, and in pantomime; and in 1911, not long after her first marriage, to the actor Leslie Chatfield, she confidently set off to the United States seeking work. There she established herself so well in New York as a singer in operetta and in revue (she was in the <span class="italic">Ziegfeld Follies</span> for some time) that she did not return to London until 1916. She returned to appear at Daly's Theatre in a musical comedy, <span class="italic">The Happy Day</span>, written by Seymour Hicks with music by Sidney Jones and Paul A. Rubens. Although she was not the lead in <span class="italic">The Happy Day</span>, within a year (1917) she was Teresa in <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span>, an operetta with words by Frederick Lonsdale and music by Harold Fraser-Simson and her stepfather J. W. Tate which ran at Daly's for more than three years: 1352 performances in all. It grew quickly into one of the favourite London plays of the war. Soldiers on leave crowded to see Jos&eacute; Collins, and her song &#145;Love will Find a Way&#146; was heard everywhere. For nearly a decade Collins was hugely popular with lovers of musical comedy. Invariably an attacking actress, she took to the stage with the same spirit and confidence which her mother had shown in the music-halls. Her strong bravura performances, her looks, the quality of her voice, and her well-known &#145;forceful personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15) were famous far beyond the circle of the West End theatres. She was described as &#145;the uncrowned queen of the musical comedy kingdom&#146;  (ibid.). But her success as Teresa typecast her in the same kind of good-hearted romantic roles, and such parts could not continue indefinitely.<br>
<br>She followed <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span> with a similar part, that of Dolores in <span class="italic">The Southern Maid</span> (1920). Still at Daly's, in 1921 she was Sybil Renaud in <span class="italic">Sybil</span>. She left Daly's after a quarrel with James White, the financier from Rochdale who had bought the theatre and who had entered her dressing-room uninvited with a party of friends. Always hot-tempered, she was quick to resent any slight or attempt to lessen her privileges. She moved across, under Robert Evett's management, to the Gaiety Theatre, where for a time she continued her success in such different parts as Vera in <span class="italic">The Last Waltz</span> (1922) by R. Evett and R. Arkell (music by Oskar Straus), the name-part in <span class="italic">Catherine</span> (1923) by R. Arkell and F. de Gresac, and Nell Gwynne in <span class="italic">Our Nell</span> (1924). Although a generous portrait, the last was an undistinguished piece by L. N. Parker and R. Arkell, to music by Harold Fraser-Simson and Ivor Novello.<br>
<br>In 1925 Collins invested and lost a good deal of her own money through the failure of a production of <span class="italic">Frasquita</span> at the Prince's Theatre. She had a nervous breakdown following this episode, and although she toured various variety theatres in Britain and the United States, and took part in a brief and stormy run of George W. Meyer's revue <span class="italic">Whitebirds</span> at His Majesty's Theatre in 1927, she &#145;never regained her commanding position in the theatre&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15). Eventually her intermittent stage work ceased altogether.<br>
<br>Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1917. On 27 October 1920 she married Lord Robert Edward Innes-Ker (1885&#150;1958), third son of the seventh duke of Roxburghe. They were divorced in 1935. That year she married Dr Gerald Baeyertz Kirkland, who survived her. She had no children. During the Second World War, when her husband served as a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps, she trained as a nurse in order to work voluntarily at the hospitals where he was stationed. During her later years she lived a quiet domestic life in suburban Essex. She died in an Epping hospital on 6 December 1958.<br>
