</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Duffy,  Eimar Ultan</span>  (1893&#150;1935), <span class="occ">writer and political economist</span>, was born on 29 September 1893 at 26 Gardiner Place, Dublin, the elder son of Kevin Emmet O'Duffy, a prominent dentist, and his wife, Pauline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campbell. His grandfather John O'Duffy had been the founder (with others) of the Dublin Dental Hospital, while his father would become dentist-in-ordinary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, which gave the family entry to Dublin Castle society. His grandfather's house was on fashionable Rutland Square (now Parnell Square), and Eimar too was reared in a large Georgian mansion, 85 Harcourt Street. The scenes of childhood in his novel <span class="italic">The Wasted Island</span> (1920) reflect in detail the atmosphere of this period of his life.<br>
<br>Eimar was sent in 1903 to the Jesuit school Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, where many upper-class Irish Catholics sent their sons to be educated and to acquire better accents. He went on to University College, Dublin, in preference to an English university, matriculating in summer 1911. There he studied for the bachelor in dental surgery degree.<br>
<br>O'Duffy joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and was active in the Irish Volunteers as an adjutant with the 2nd battalion. He was also director of supply and communications for the Dublin brigade. His slight British accent was resented by some. He wrote &#145;A military causerie&#146; for the republican movement's weekly paper, the <span class="italic">National Volunteer</span>, from 6 October 1914.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 O'Duffy's father threatened to disown both sons if they did not join up. The younger, Kevin Emmet O'Duffy, was commissioned in September 1914 but Eimar refused to join the British army and was expelled from the family home. From now until 1920 he lived in lodgings in the Rathmines area.<br>
<br>At college O'Duffy was known for his light satirical topical verse and for his contributions to the Literary and Historical Society, the college debating forum, where he won a silver medal for debating in 1915&#150;16. He had his early plays&#151;<span class="italic">The Walls of Athens</span>, <span class="italic">The Phoenix on the Roof</span>, and <span class="italic">Bricriu's Feast</span>&#151;produced by Edward Martyn's Irish Theatre but another play, <span class="italic">If I Were You</span>, was refused by the Abbey. His interview with the widow of the late exiled Fenian O'Donovan Rossa appeared in the <span class="italic">Irish Volunteer</span> (7 August 1915).<br>
<br>O'Duffy's association with Bulmer Hobson and J. J. O'Connell, when the Irish Volunteers split, led to his involvement in trying to prevent the Easter rising of 1916. He was one of Professor Eoin MacNeill's messengers in the hectic days before the rising began, being sent up to Belfast by Bulmer Hobson to ensure that the volunteers there would obey the orders of MacNeill, and not those of Pearse and the inner core of IRB members who plotted the rising. During Easter week O'Duffy remained in hiding from the authorities in Belfast. He returned to find Dublin in public and private turmoil. During the rising his grandfather John O'Duffy, then eighty-one, was shot while walking in Moore Street, and died of his wounds in Jervis Street Hospital. O'Duffy's younger brother, by then promoted to lieutenant with the 7th Royal Munster Fusiliers, had been killed at Suvla Bay on 6 August 1915, the first day of the landings during the Gallipoli campaign. These deaths led to a reconciliation with his father, but Eimar was not allowed to wear his volunteer uniform at home in Harcourt Street.<br>
<br>O'Duffy qualified as a dentist in spring 1917 (with second-class honours) and became a member of the British Dental Association. At first he practised with his father in Harcourt Street, then set up on his own at 8 Fitzwilliam Street in 1919. He gave up his practice before August 1920 to devote himself to his writing.<br>
<br>For a period O'Duffy worked as a teacher at Father Sweetman's famous school, Mount St Benedict's, near Gorey, though by 1920 he thought of himself as an author rather than as a dentist or teacher. He published <span class="italic">A Lay of the Liffey and other Verses</span> in 1918 and edited <span class="italic">A College Chorus</span>&#151;&#145;a collection of Humorous Verses by the students of University College&#146;&#151;in 1919. By October 1919 he had completed a largely autobiographical novel about the years leading up to 1916, which was printed in Dublin late in 1919. It was published in February 1920 as <span class="italic">The Wasted Island</span>. Dedicated to O'Duffy's mother, the novel deals with the emotional and political development of a young Irishman much like himself. Woven into his account of political developments was his contempt for many aspects of the Irish literary movement, its lack of ambition, its amateurism, and contentment to do things on a small scale. The events of the rising left O'Duffy embittered at what he saw as the futile gesture of &#145;schemers&#146;. The <span class="italic">Irish Book Lover</span> noted in its review that &#145;the author denounces the falsehood and treachery towards their comrades, of the extremists who rushed into the rebellion. Here, as elsewhere, he is remarkably outspoken, but the whole tone of the books is marked by clear and independent thinking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Book Lover</span>, 11/8, March 1920, 82).<br>
<br>On 16 August 1920 O'Duffy, then living at 4 Williams Park, Rathmines, married Cathleen Patricia (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), daughter of John Cruise O'Brien, a solicitor; they had two children. Further novels followed. <span class="italic">Printer's Errors: a Comedy of Dublin Manners</span> (1920) satirized many of his associates in the small theatrical world of the city; <span class="italic">The Lion and the Fox</span> (1921) was a historical novel; and <span class="italic">Miss Rudd and Some Lovers</span> (1923) was a comic novel set in a Rathgar boarding-house during the troubles. These books made him little money, however.<br>
<br>O'Duffy supported the Anglo-Irish treaty (December 1921) from a Liberal point of view and as a result he was employed for a period during 1922 in the new department of external affairs, then headed by Desmond Fitzgerald. In winter 1922&#150;3 he edited with Bulmer Hobson and P. S. O'Hegarty seven issues of the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span>, in which he printed his own review of Joyce's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> (9 December 1922). It was one of the few commentaries on the novel to appear in the Irish press.<br>
<br>O'Duffy was actively disliked by many. Asked on one occasion to take the chair at the Literary and Historical Society at University College, Dublin, he was barracked by the students and had to withdraw. Justice Cahir Davitt, a college contemporary, recalled that those on the left disliked him because of the positions he had taken up as an editor of the <span class="italic">Review</span>, while the nationalists shunned him because of his role in 1916 and for his opinions in <span class="italic">The Wasted Island</span>.<br>
<br>O'Duffy's short sharp manner was due in large part to the ulcer which he developed as a young man. Yet to Cahir Davitt he was &#145;a quiet little man whom I knew only as an ex-schoolmaster who had published some poems, one of them worthy of more notice than it has received&#146;.<br>
<br>The O'Duffys were living in Daffodil Cottage, Orwell Road, Rathgar, when in late 1924 O'Duffy lost his job in external affairs. That autumn, early in October, a few weeks after the birth of their daughter, they left Ireland and moved to Paris, where O'Duffy had taken a post on the night staff of the European edition of the <span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span>. They lived in an apartment in the rue Byron, in the 8th <i>arrondissement</i>, behind the &Eacute;toile. In summer 1926 O'Duffy obtained a post in the Liberal publications department (then at 41 Parliament Street, London). The family lived first at 82 Woodland Gardens, Muswell Hill, and then at 25 Leaside Avenue, Fortis Green, a short distance away.<br>
<br>After three years in preparation, the first of O'Duffy's Cuanduine trilogy, his satire on modern Ireland, was published in 1926. <span class="italic">King Goshawk and the Birds</span> was a critical success and immediately reprinted. In 1927 a short play, <span class="italic">Romulus and Remus</span>, was published under his pen-name Oliver Sidgwick in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Short Plays for Small Stages</span>, produced by the Liberal publications department. The second volume of the Cuanduine trilogy, <span class="italic">The Spacious Adventures of the Man in the Street</span>, appeared in 1928, while a revised version of <span class="italic">The Wasted Island</span> was published in 1929.<br>
<br>Between summer 1929 and autumn 1931 O'Duffy turned from literature to journalism. He was a publicity agent to the Lloyd George Liberals (1931&#150;5) for a period, but not in any way that brought him personally to the public attention. Indeed his support of the group made him redundant at the Liberal publications office. A political pamphlet poem, <span class="italic">National Christmas</span>, was published in a limited edition of a hundred signed copies at Christmas 1931 by Blue Moon Books. Yet he was popular among the Irish colony in London and wide journalistic connections as he &#145;wrote in a sparkling style on the most abstruse problems of economics and finance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>).<br>
<br>It was while working out his satires that O'Duffy developed his ideas of financial reform and he became absorbed with the money theories of the social credit apostle Major C. H. Douglas. Social credit appealed to O'Duffy and many others between the wars as providing an escape from the morass of depression and poverty without resort to nationalization or socialism. In his enthusiasm O'Duffy published a series of books on financial and social reform: <span class="italic">Life and Money</span> in 1932, <span class="italic">Machinery: Captor or Liberator?</span>, <span class="italic">The Procrustean Fallacy</span>, and <span class="italic">The Leisure State</span>, all in 1932. He was a founder member of both the Leisure Society and the Prosperity League. In 1934 he made a very successful lecture tour of various towns in Norway at the invitation of a Norwegian businessmen's group interested in social credit.<br>
<br>At the end of 1931 the O'Duffys moved out of London to 65 Kings Road, Byfleet, near Cobham, in Surrey. At this time O'Duffy acted as a reader for various publishers and he also published a series of detective thrillers: <span class="italic">The Bird Cage</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Secret Enemy</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Head of a Girl</span> (1935). These did not do much to retrieve a literary reputation already in decline. He was also working on a musical comedy in three acts which was to be called &#145;Let's be Modern&#146;. The last of the Cuanduine trilogy, <span class="italic">Asses in Clover</span>, was published in 1933. He finished what was to be his final novel, the thriller <span class="italic">Head of a Girl</span>, at Byfleet in October 1934.<br>
<br>O'Duffy had been eking out a living as a freelance journalist, but the reunification of the Liberal Party brought him back to the Liberal publications office at the end of 1934. The family then moved to 64 Portland Avenue, New Malden, Surrey.<br>
<br>Brian O'Duffy recalled that his father was &#145;quite short, probably 5'6" or so [&hellip;] nearly all our male friends were noticeably taller than he was. He was slim and lightly built&#146;  (private information). He had delicate features and wore glasses.<br>
<br>While writing his later books O'Duffy was in almost continual pain. Following an operation on a perforated duodenal ulcer, he died a few days later on 21 March 1935 at St Anthony's Hospital, Cheam, Surrey. Though his health had obviously been failing, his sudden death &#145;was a loss almost as unexpected as it was widely lamented&#146;  (<span class="italic">New English Weekly</span>). His remains were interred in the cemetery at Morden, Surrey. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Though it had been announced for publication in 1934, an autobiographical book, &#145;The portrait gallery&#146;, which contained some unflattering remarks about friends and relatives, was withdrawn by his own wish and the materials later destroyed. After his death O'Duffy's books went quickly out of print and interest in him did not revive until the 1960s. O'Duffy's was an uneven career. Dying in his early forties, O'Duffy had hardly fulfilled his promise, and even his admirers have to admit that his reputation rests precariously on the trilogy of Cuanduine satires, on his plays, and most of all on <span class="italic">The Wasted Island</span>, which though flawed was one of the most moving recreations of developments in Ireland during the years between 1900 and 1916. To his political friends in the social credit movement Eimar O'Duffy had been &#145;a highly valued and spirited colleague&#146;  (private information); and despite his faults and his early death, he survives as one of the most significant Irish writers of the later years of the Irish literary revival.<br>
