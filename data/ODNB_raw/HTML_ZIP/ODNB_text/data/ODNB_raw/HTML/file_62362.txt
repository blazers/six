<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fuller,  Nicholas</span>  (1543&#150;1620), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the son of Nicholas Fuller, a London merchant of Neat's Hall in the Isle of Sheppey. He attended Christ's College, Cambridge, from December 1560, and graduated BA in 1563. Admitted that year to Gray's Inn, Fuller was elected pensioner on 23 November 1584, and reader on 26 May 1587. By 1584 he had married Sarah, daughter of Nicholas Backhouse, alderman and former sheriff of London, and in 1586 the couple set up home at Chamberhouse, near Thatcham, Berkshire. The eldest of their seven known children, also named Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1620), was born in 1592, admitted to Gray's Inn in 1601, and knighted by James I on 22 June 1619.<h2>
<a name="Legalandearlyparliamentarycareer15861604"></a>Legal and early parliamentary career, 1586&#150;1604</h2>In 1585 Fuller was offered the post of solicitor-general in Dublin, but managed to avoid the duty. On 8 February 1588 he became dean of the chapel of Gray's Inn, and in 1591 was elected to the prestigious role of treasurer. From 1588 he was often employed by the privy council in matters concerning state servants and national security. But he also began to incur official disapproval. In July 1590 the puritan minister John Udall was tried for writing a &#145;seditious&#146; book, and Fuller acted for him. When Judge Clarke instructed the jury to find Udall guilty on the fact of his authorship and &#145;leave the felony to us&#146;, he intervened caustically, provoking a hostile response from the prosecutor and noisy scenes as Udall was removed from the chamber.<br>
<br>In 1591 Fuller appeared for Thomas Cartwright and other ministers whose attendance at synods and classes was said to amount to sedition. The case was dramatically altered when, at Cheapside on 16 July 1591, Edmund Copinger and Henry Arthington proclaimed Elizabeth deposed, and William Hacket the new messiah and king of Europe. This was sedition indeed. Four days later Fuller was committed to the Fleet by the same warrant which ordered Hacket's arrest, perhaps because he had offered to represent the accused. The authorities failed to secure the conviction of Cartwright and his fellow ministers; this has been attributed to &#145;the highly professional resistance of the puritan lawyers&#146;, which &#145;perhaps owed much to Nicholas Fuller&#146;  (Collinson, 420&#150;1). He remained close prisoner until 15 August. The flow of state commissions dried up, and Fuller's indiscreet libel against the lord admiral in 1596 must have confirmed his disfavour within an increasingly conservative establishment.<br>
<br>In 1593 Fuller sat as MP for St Mawes. He was prominent in opposing government attempts to extend the scope of the 1581 recusancy laws to separatists, fearing that it might also be used against non-separatist puritans. On 4 April 1593 he denounced the second of two bills, sent from the Lords after the rejection of the first, as &#145;dangerous to good subjects&#146;: it made &#145;schisms to be equal with seditions and treasons, which is against the equity of the former law&#146;. He moved in committee &#145;to the striking out of the title and the whole preamble. No man spake for it&#146;  (Hartley, 3.162, 167). After further hostile scrutiny the bill passed in heavily amended form.<h2>
<a name="Governmentcritic16041607"></a>Government critic, 1604&#150;1607</h2>Fuller appears not to have sought re-election in 1597&#150;8, but he sat in the first parliament of James I, as a member for the City of London. For the next ten years he was the government's sharpest and most tenacious critic. In 1606, for example, he urged action against recusants, and spoke for deprived ministers; and he presented economic grievances over purveyance, the farming of fines, patents, various impositions, and cloth production. &#145;Mr Fuller of Gray's Inn, a prime man in the council of London&#146;  (Willson, 33&#150;4) was clearly important to city merchants. But commercial issues were rarely separable from politics. Fuller helped pursue the government agent Tipper, charged with obtaining money under false pretences while in service of the revenue. He complained against impositions on currants. This was cause in Bate's case, in which the exchequer found that the king was entitled to raise customs rates in peacetime. Fuller urged that duties imposed without parliamentary consent were illegal. He was prominent in opposition to &#145;purveyance&#146;, under which the crown might buy supplies at less than market prices. He objected that purveyors enriched themselves at the expense of suppliers and of the state, and imposed this abuse through their own &#145;court of green cloth&#146;. Efforts to abolish purveyance ran into opposition, notably from those concerned to defend or extend the limits of the royal prerogative.<br>
<br>Fuller was interested in other issues which bore on constitutional principles. When attending joint conferences between the two chambers, MPs were made to stand hatless, respectfully awaiting the pleasure of the Lords. In March 1607 he recommended on behalf of the committee of privileges that the Lords be asked to treat them more considerately. He appealed to a principle of equality between the two chambers: when in the past a few peers had visited the Commons to confer, &#145;it is not likely the whole commons did stand or were bare in reverence of so few sent down to them&#146;  (Willson, 233). On 12 April 1606 he reported that at a joint conference the judges had tried to present their views on the legality of a bill as unchallengeable by MPs. He had objected that the conference was not a court, and was rebuked for it, although subsequently cleared of fault by the House of Commons.<h2>
<a name="Constitutionalbattles16071610"></a>Constitutional battles, 1607&#150;1610</h2>Ministerial plans for union with Scotland aroused widespread suspicion in parliament. In February 1607 Fuller warned that impoverished Scottish artisans and feuding lairds might descend on the lush pastures of English commerce and law. The speech sought to connect both with the fears of artisans and merchants, and with resentment at Scottish courtiers, who, many felt, were showered with offices and honours. But Fuller spoke less crudely than many among the opponents of union. His main concern was with the legal issues raised by the proposals. These were not merely technical; they seemed to present political dangers. In Scotland the independence of parliament was not well entrenched; while two legal systems prevailed, the government disposed of extra discretionary powers which bypassed the statutes of either country, powers which appeared at odds with parliamentary &#145;liberties&#146;. He feared the subordination of the English common law to courts operating outside the control of statute, and the extension of the royal prerogative.<br>
<br>Fuller's constitutional ideas led him into serious conflict with these forces. In early 1607 he agreed to act for two men, Thomas Ladd of Yarmouth and Richard Mansell of Gloucester, imprisoned by the high commission for actions subversive of the established church and its courts. Having secured a writ of habeas corpus, Fuller undertook their defence in king's bench, at hearings on 6 May and 13 June. He argued that the court of high commission had no power to arrest or imprison. Its officers were corrupt, its procedures popish and illegal. Fuller took his arguments into parliament. In June 1607 he charged that the high commission &#145;at every renewing increaseth and encroacheth more power and more&#146;, in breach of the laws of the land, and presented a bill which if passed would have emasculated it  (Willson, 351). Despite, or because of, his public assault on the ecclesiastical courts, he seems to have retained the confidence of most MPs. On 26 June 1607, the Commons desired to elect him chairman of the committee of the whole house; Fuller modestly stood aside in favour of Hobart, the attorney-general. While the house sat, he could claim privilege against arrest. But his actions threatened the very existence of the high commission, and soon after the prorogation on 4 July, it arraigned and imprisoned him in the White Lion at Southwark.<br>
<br>Fuller immediately appealed to the common law judges. Fenner and Croke upheld the right of king's bench to determine whether the high commission held jurisdiction in his case. King's bench was in recess, but would hear the case when it reconvened; in the meantime, they issued a prohibition, halting the commission's legal pursuit of Fuller. In September 1607 a conference was held between the barons of the exchequer and the judges of the king's bench and common pleas. It issued a &#145;consultation&#146; which enabled the high commission to proceed against Fuller on lesser charges of heresy and schism. On 20 or 21 October he was convicted, fined &pound;200, and gaoled, but quickly secured from king's bench a new writ of habeas corpus, which challenged the authority by which he was detained.<br>
<br>Fuller was in effect arguing that the commissioners had no power to imprison him even in relation to cases lying within its jurisdiction. It had no coercive power at all. The full implications of his case now lay exposed. The king could only delegate powers whose limits had been defined by statute: the powers set out in letters patent, under which the commission operated, were illegal. This called into question not only the existence of the high commission but the royal prerogative itself. Ministers became alarmed. On 24 November 1607 the judges of king's bench accepted the attorney-general's view that, having conceded jurisdiction in the determination of guilt, they had no right to pronounce on sentence. Fuller was sent back to prison. Two days later he secured a second hearing, on the grounds that he had lacked counsel at the first, and the arguments were re-rehearsed.<br>
<br>James I had become convinced that the common lawyers were out to extend their jurisdiction at the expense of ecclesiastical authorities appointed by him. He visited Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, and pressed him to pursue the case, urging Cecil that &#145;the ecclesiastical commission may not be suffered to sink besides the evil deserts of that villain [Fuller]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 19.285&#150;6), lest the monarchy itself be harmed. James kept the case under continuous review, repeatedly urging expedition upon his ministers. When, on 24 November, the judges found against Fuller again, he thanked them, congratulating Cecil upon his discreet handling of the matter.<br>
<br>In the Fleet Fuller faced conflicting pressures. A prosperous lawyer and parliamentarian, he had forced the authorities to the view that the defence of both the high commission and the prerogative depended on his committal. Now, however, he vacillated, signing a submission and then withdrawing it at the behest of his wife and friends. On 5 January 1608, after signing a second submission, he was released. Earlier, however, he had passed a draft account of his argument against the commission to radical associates, who in December published it as <span class="italic">The Argument of N.F.</span>. These were not new friends. From 1604 Fuller seems to have advised clerical opponents of the bishops on how they might use the common law courts to resist deprivation. A group of these, including Mansell, circulated a series of illegal pamphlets, printed on a secret press. But in January 1608 copies of <span class="italic">The Argument of N.F.</span> were seized and on 27 February, at Star Chamber, Mansell, Fuller, and three others faced charges of sedition.<br>
<br>Citing both Foxe's martyrology and legal precedent, Fuller's <span class="italic">Argument</span> held that many of the powers and procedures of ecclesiastical courts were not only technically illegal but affronted the rule of equity and common justice. He proceeded to a memorable summary: &#145;the laws of England are the high inheritance of the realm, by which both the King and the subjects are directed&#146;. The law &#145;admeasureth the King's prerogative so as it doth not extend to hurt the inheritance of the subject&#146;. No charter or commission was legal &#145;unless the same charters and commissions, do receive life and strength from some Act of Parliament&#146;. And if &#145;any grant or commission from the King doth tend to charge the body, lands or goods of the subjects unlawfully, the Judges will redress the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">Argument</span>, 3, 9, 11, 14&#150;15). The last assertion reflected great faith in judicial independence, still largely untested in 1608, but it helped ensure that the judges would be so tested. Nicholas Fuller thus made his own theoretical contribution to the disintegration of the Tudor compromise on sovereignty, anticipating the pronouncements of Hakewill and Coke. It seems that <span class="italic">The Argument</span> had come to light before Fuller's release; he was rearrested and by 26 January 1608 was &#145;close prisoner with the Dean of Pauls&#146;. The outcome of the case in Star Chamber is unclear; on 10 April the court ruled that Fuller might practise law, but was to be confined to the precincts of Gray's Inn pending further action, of which nothing is known.<h2>
<a name="Laterparliamentarycareerandthefinalyears16101620"></a>Later parliamentary career and the final years, 1610&#150;1620</h2>Throughout his career Fuller remained active in his parish, and encouraged participation in its affairs by other leading laymen. The churchwardens were made to record their accounts more fully, and forbidden to lease parish property without permission. In 1608 a charge for communion bread was levied on all but the poorest. Fuller was a trustee of local charities; probably on his initiative a legal ruling was obtained in October 1610, ensuring that their resources were used for the relief of the poor.<br>
<br>When Fuller returned to Westminster in 1610, the conflict with the authorities had in no way diminished his status. His basic ideas were unchanged. In principle, he continued to stand for the abolition of wardship, which would both remove a burden from many subjects and agree better with God's laws. But it was necessary to provide legal security for any agreement with the crown, and this was not easy: &#145;I would willingly give somewhat out of my estate, so as I might be assured to know what the rest were and enjoy it safely. But before those fears be cleared I cannot for my part have any comfort in the bargain&#146;  (E. R. Foster, 2.321). On 23 June 1610 Fuller set out his views on the prerogative with special sharpness, restating the view of his <span class="italic">Argument</span> that both king and subjects were subject to law, and attacking unparliamentary taxation. His speech was greeted by &#145;a great silence&#146;  (ibid., 2.165). In November he attacked again his old enemy the high commission, urging that parliament should not trust verbal promises that agencies unaccountable to it would refrain from abusing their powers. Prelatical courts &#145;would turn their chair into a throne, an abuse contrary to the laws of this kingdom, and (I verily think), the law of God&#146;. He reviewed the Commons' efforts to restore deprived ministers, end non-residency, enforce the sabbath, and reform wardship and purveyance: &#145;there were never wiser gentlemen in the House and never less done&#146;. If these bills &#145;had passed for law by joint assent of the other house and his Majesty&#146;, England might now be the happiest of states  (ibid., 407&#150;10). This came close to blaming king and Lords for the deficiencies of nation and church.<br>
<br>In March 1614 there was a contest over parliamentary seats in London. The city chose Sir Thomas Low as their first knight, but refused &#145;to admit Master Recorder [Montague], alledging only that he is the King's sergeant. Master Fuller is their first burgess.&#146; The choice, it was rightly remarked, was &#145;as much subject to interpretation as the refusal of the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.515&#150;16). Fuller opposed reform proposals of April 1614, by which bills of &#145;grace and favour&#146; were to be granted by the king in return for early supply. When, in May, Bishop Neile accused the house of sedition in questioning the right of the king to fix duties, Fuller responded that Neile &#145;hath great access to the King and that he is most unworthy of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 499). With the Addled Parliament, Fuller's long career as a leading parliamentarian came to a close.<br>
<br>Now in his seventies, Fuller still kept up a busy schedule; he remained active in parish affairs, and audited the churchwardens' and almshouse accounts. He continued to attend meetings of the Gray's Inn benchers until 19 November 1619. He died on 23 February 1620 at Chamberhouse and was buried at Thatcham church on 2 March. In his will Fuller left much property, mostly to his wife, Sarah, and son, Nicholas; there were bequests to the poor at Newbury and to the preachers Stephen Egerton and John Dod.<br>
<br>Fuller left two monuments. His shield once appeared on the south window of the Old Hall at Gray's Inn; there is a representation of it in Dugdale's <span class="italic">Origines juridiciales</span> (1671). At the Chamberhouse chapel he appears wearing a barrister's gown, with his wife, two sons, and five daughters. The inscription celebrates Fuller's piety, his fame, and his commitment to knowledge, truth, and justice.<br>
