<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clive <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Raftor]</span>,  Catherine <span class="st"> [Kitty]</span></span>  (1711&#150;1785), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 5 November 1711, according to a letter she wrote to a fellow actress, Jane Pope, in 1782. According to William Chetwood's <span class="italic">General History of the Stage</span> (1749), Clive was the daughter of William Raftor, a Kilkenny lawyer of considerable estate who ruined his fortunes by aligning himself with James II during the latter's campaign in Ireland in 1690. After a period of exile, he was pardoned and returned to London to marry a Mrs Daniel, &#145;Daughter to an eminent Citizen on Fishstreethill with whom he had a handsome Fortune&#146;  (Chetwood, 126). Chetwood further claims that the couple had numerous children, but the names of these brothers and sisters are unknown, except for James (<i>d</i>. 1790), who joined Kitty in a stage career, and a sister whose married name was Mrs Mestivyer. There is evidence that Kitty Clive supported her father once she was working, so whatever handsome fortune was in place when her parents married evidently dwindled over time.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Chetwood also tells the story of the actress's advent to the stage in 1728, when he was serving as prompter at Drury Lane. A friend of Jane Johnson, the first wife of Theophilus Cibber, Kitty was introduced to both Cibber and Chetwood. They, in turn, impressed with her &#145;infinite Spirits, with a Voice and Manner in singing Songs of Pleasantry peculiar to herself&#146;  (Chetwood, 127), recommended her to Colley Cibber, who added her to his list of performers at Drury Lane. Chetwood indicates that she had a few minor appearances in the spring of 1728, but once the full 1728&#150;9 season opened she began appearing regularly in increasingly large and important roles. Throughout that season and those that followed she moved from supporting roles in tragedy to singing in afterpieces and playing the first-ranking characters in the farces popular in the period.<br>
<br>The fashion of musical comedy and burlesque suited Kitty's vocal and comic talents perfectly, and she shone in parts such as Nell in Charles Coffey's <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span>, in which she portrayed a cobbler's wife transformed into the lady of the manor. Henry Fielding wrote several parts for her that highlighted her skills, including Chloe in <span class="italic">The Lottery</span> and Lappet in an adaptation of Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">The Miser</span>. In the summer of 1732 she was given the most sought-after female role in musical comedy, Polly in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, and received a tribute to her portrayal from the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, which called her the &#145;Darling of the Age&#146;  (25 July 1732).<br>
<br>During the rebellion of the players in 1733, Kitty remained with John Highmore's company at Drury Lane. One of the most popular actresses to do so, she earned the ire of hack writers who supported the alternative company at the Haymarket. Their squibs provide some insight into her character and to the position she had attained on stage. <span class="italic">The Theatric Squabble</span> (1733) described her as:<blockquote>
<div>A pleasing Actress, but a Green-Room Scold<br>
</div>
<div>Puffed with Success, she triumphs over all<br>
</div>
<div>Snarls in the Scene-Room, Curses in the Hall.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Henry Fielding, who also remained loyal to Drury Lane, praised her acting talents and the alternative view of her character. In his preface to <span class="italic">The Intriguing Chambermaid</span> (1734), in which she played the title role, he compliments her as &#145;the best Wife, the best Daughter, the best Sister, and the best Friend&#146;  (Fielding). Although to some degree both descriptions are coloured by their authors' intentions, they do indicate the personality traits and acting skills which would remain consistent throughout her long career. Kitty Clive was both quick-witted and quick-tempered. She would prove a generous friend but a dangerous enemy. She maintained a reputation for chastity in her personal life, yet she sparkled on stage when &#145;personating the foolish and vitious&#146;  (Fielding) of her sex. Her best roles were particular comic types: the silly country miss, the wiser and more fashionable version of the same, and the pert and resourceful servant. These remained her strong suit for much of her career.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandthePollywar"></a>Marriage and the &#145;Polly war&#146;</h2>Few details are known about Catherine Raftor's marriage to George Clive (<i>d</i>. 1780), a barrister and second cousin to Robert Clive &#145;of India&#146;, but she appeared as Mrs Clive in the bills for the first time in October 1733. The name change suggests that the pair had just married or had done so during the summer, when she would not have been performing regularly. Evidence about the couple's married life is also slight, but the two did not live together for very long, separating some time in 1735. Chetwood, ostensibly declining to comment on marital affairs, declares, &#145;I never could imagine she deserved ill Usage&#146;  (Chetwood, 128), implying that was just what she received. Years later, in a letter to David Garrick, Clive herself commented, &#145;You are very much mistaken if you imagine I shall be sorry to hear Mr. Clive is well; besides, it is so long ago since I thought he used me ill, that I have quite forgot it&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). George Clive was less forgiving and, in his will, made a point of excluding her from any benefit at his death, &#145;it being my will and intention that she have nothing to do with my executors &amp; representatives nor they with her&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Although Clive herself did not contribute to the pamphlet war during the theatrical rebellion of 1733, in 1736 she had reason to believe that the acting manager, Theophilus Cibber, was trying to claim some of her roles for his second wife, Susannah. Clive published her side of the controversy in the press in order to defend her position on the stage. The question of which actress was to play Polly in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> provoked a storm in the papers, and the dispute received regular mention in the <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span>, <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, <span class="italic">Grub Street Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">London Daily Post and General Advertiser</span>. This &#145;Polly war&#146; also inspired a farce, <span class="italic">The Beggar's Pantomime, or, Contending Columbines</span>, which was performed regularly at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Given its long run, the afterpiece probably made more money for its producers than the original's limited revival at Drury Lane, regardless of who played Polly.<br>
<br>It seems likely that Theophilus Cibber, a notorious puffer, was behind some of the attacks against Clive, who, by 1736, was a well-established comic actress and vocalist. At the same time she did not shy away from defending herself in print and on the stage:<blockquote>It is my consolation to think, that as I have always endeavor'd to please them [the town] as an Actress, to the best of my Abilities, whatever has been urged to the contrary by the Malice of my Enemies, will have no weight or Influence upon my Friends. (<span class="italic">London Daily Post and General Advertiser</span>, 19 Nov 1736)</blockquote>When Clive's appearance as Polly was finally presented, she addressed herself to the house, apologizing for the disturbance and offering to play the secondary part of Lucy instead. This apologetic tone and willingness to appease her audience secured both her popularity and the role of Polly until she herself was ready to bestow it on a younger actress of her own choosing in 1745.<br>
<br>Although publicly Clive decried and apparently regretted bringing theatrical matters notoriety in the press, the lesson she learned during the Polly war served her well in 1744. After the failure of Charles Macklin and David Garrick to open a third theatre to break the monopoly held by the patentees, Clive found herself unemployed. Rather than relying on others to defend her position and livelihood, that October she printed a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Case of Mrs. Clive Submitted to the Publick</span>, explaining her position and that of other performers. Particularly galling to her was the loss of her annual free benefit, a privilege she had held for nine years, and how she discovered her lack of a job&#151;by finding other actresses listed in her roles in the bills. This &#145;unprecedented Act of Injustice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Case of Mrs. Clive</span>, 14) did not allow her the time to find work in Dublin, where she had met with success during the summer of 1741. Following the publication of her pamphlet, Clive held a benefit concert at the Haymarket on 2 November by command of Frederick, prince of Wales, and Augusta, princess of Wales. The royal couple had commanded Clive's benefits in the past, and their continued patronage of her expressed their personal dismay at the lord chamberlain's ruling in favour of the patentees. Theophilus Cibber confirmed that the audience at the benefit had been a notable one, by describing the affair as having &#145;many Persons of the first Distinction &hellip; in the Pit and Boxes&#146;  (Cibber, 76). The manager, John Rich, no fool, recognized Clive's drawing power, and rehired her the next month at Drury Lane, although not at the salary level she had previously attained. As in the Polly war, Clive found that humble approaches to the theatregoing public could push theatrical management to some semblance of civility towards players. At the same time there was some cost to her reputation, and she maintained the dubious distinction of being a demanding and even temperamental actress. Samuel Foote best described the equivocal nature of her character and defended her actions: &#145;This lady has now and then perhaps &hellip; expressed herself behind the Scenes in too loud and forcible a Manner &hellip; But &hellip; this Vehemence is assumed in order to procure a more decent Entertainment&#146;  (Foote, 42&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Stability"></a>Stability</h2>Once David Garrick attained the patent for Drury Lane in 1747, Clive's career settled down considerably. Printed appeals to the public were no longer necessary, except for a skirmish with the actor Ned Shuter over benefit performances in 1761. She continued to shine in her best venue, the stage. She retained many of the parts that she had made famous, including Nell in <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span>, but moved out of <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> roles into those more suited to her maturing voice and figure. Flora in Susanna Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Wonder</span>, Mrs Cadwallader in Foote's <span class="italic">The Author</span>, the Fine Lady in Garrick's <span class="italic">Lethe</span>, and Lady Wishfort in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span> were typical of these later roles. Comedy remained her forte, but she also continued her facility in speaking prologues and epilogues. Garrick was especially proficient at presenting aspects of her reputation in these short speeches, which provoked the audience to laughter. During the competition between Drury Lane and Covent Garden over <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, Garrick wrote an epilogue for Clive, although she held no role in the production; &#145;What! All these janglings and I not make one!&#146; highlighted her irascible reputation and was typical of these short pieces in which the actress essentially played herself. Clive's comic opera song, in which she made fun of Italian singers and their exorbitant salaries, continued to please audiences. Although she was never successful in tragedy, her Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, in which she imitated the speech and mannerisms of the lord chief justice, William Murray, Baron Mansfield, was popular with audiences but disdained by critics.<br>
<br>A dedicated performer, and one with full appreciation for the transience of theatrical life, Clive continued to seek new roles for herself and new ways to supplement her income. She tried her hand at writing farces, which became a feature of her benefits. Her first, <span class="italic">The Rehearsal, or, Bays in Petticoats</span>, was first presented at her benefit in 1750. There were scattered additional performances, and it was eventually published in 1753. Clive wrote at least three more farces, <span class="italic">Every Woman in her Humour</span>, <span class="italic">A Fine Lady's Return from a Rout</span>, and <span class="italic">The Faithful Irishwoman</span>, but none received even the limited fame that her first had done and none was published. Indeed, the second of these was rebuked in the <span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span> as &#145;Vile!&#146; and &#145;Execrable!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span>, 146) after its presentation in April 1763. These farces survive in manuscript at the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.<br>
<br>Throughout her long career Clive remained a London actress, and except for the two seasons at Covent Garden (1743&#150;5) she was loyal to Drury Lane. However, at some point in the 1740s it is apparent that she moved her primary residence to Twickenham and lived in lodgings in London during the theatrical season. In that small community, she and Horace Walpole became close friends. In 1749 she wrote to him requesting advice about a gardener, &#145;for th'o I am now representing women of qualitty and Coblers wives &amp;c &amp;c to Crowded houeses, and flattering applause; the Charecture I am most desierous to act well is; a good sort of Countrey gentlewoman at twickenham&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 40.61). Soon afterwards she had become a visible and cheering presence in his correspondence, and he gave her a small house on his property. Reading through the correspondence makes it clear that Walpole and Clive developed a strong, enduring, and almost certainly platonic friendship. He evidently relished her company and her insight into the theatrical world, while she enjoyed the amusing variety of company, their conversation, and the card games central to his social circles. There are jokes about the ruddiness of her complexion&#151;which also received notice in theatrical gossip&#151;and compliments to her good nature and good humour. Their relationship was misinterpreted in a <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in December 1769, much to Walpole's amusement. His friends such as Etheldreda, Viscountess Townshend, Isabella Seymour-Conway, countess of Hertford, and Lady Anne Connolly included the actress on an excursion to see George III's coronation, while George Montagu's Christmas gift of venison left her &#145;up to her elbows in currant jelly and gratitude&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 10.241). Through Walpole, but because of her vibrant personality, Clive successfully moved into a social milieu that transcended the purely theatrical.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>In 1768 Walpole mentioned to a friend that Clive was preparing to leave the stage, and the bill for her benefit in April 1769 advertised that it would be the &#145;last time of her appearing on the Stage&#146;  (Stone, 3.1401). She performed some of her favourite roles: Flora in <span class="italic">The Wonder</span> and the Fine Lady in <span class="italic">Lethe</span>. After more than forty successful years on the stage, Clive had earned enough to support herself comfortably in her retirement. In her published <span class="italic">Case</span> in 1744 she revealed that she had been making &pound;300 annually, plus her benefit, which in her most successful years could almost double that salary&#151;in 1750, for example, her benefit brought her just over &pound;250. In 1765, in a letter to David Garrick, she commented that her salary remained &pound;300 a year. Although much of her income would have gone to support her professional life (she spent considerable sums on singing lessons and appropriate clothes) she had evidently managed her money wisely. Her pay places her among the very best actresses of her generation, although she would complain that her tragic counterparts such as Susannah Cibber earned twice as much for working fewer nights in the theatrical week. Still, both her income and the popularity she achieved over her long career prove her star quality and her comic ability. She was easily one of the most talented and most famous actresses of her generation.<br>
<br>Her own correspondence, along with that of Walpole and David Garrick, reveals Clive's retirement to have been carefree, except for bouts of illness and occasional trouble from footpads and tax collectors. Her brother James and sister lived with her, and were, according to Jane Pope, supported by her. She busied herself with &#145;Routs either at home or abroad every night [and] all the nonsense of having my hair done time enough for my parties as I used to do for my parts with the difference that I am losing money instead of getting some&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Her periods of illness&#151;self-described jaundice&#151;eventually grew more frequent, and after catching a chill at the funeral of Lieutenant-General Henry Lister, she died on 6 December 1785. She was buried in Twickenham churchyard on 14 December. Horace Walpole dispersed her personal possessions among her friends and relatives.<br>
