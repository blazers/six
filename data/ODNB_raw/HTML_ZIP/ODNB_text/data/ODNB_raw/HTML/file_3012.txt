<span class="headword">Bourne,  William  Sturges</span>  (1769&#150;1845), <span class="occ">politician and poor-law reformer</span>, was born on 7 November 1769 as William Sturges, the only son of the Revd John Sturges DD (1736/7&#150;1807), prebendary of Winchester, and his wife, Judith, daughter of Richard Bourne, of Acton Hall, Worcester. Educated first at a private school in Winchester, he entered Winchester College in 1782 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in Michaelmas term 1786, taking his BA in 1790 and his MA in 1793. In 1831 he was created DCL. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 23 November 1793, and practised in king's bench and on the western circuit. At Oxford a lifelong friendship with George Canning was cemented. Canning thought him &#145;very clever&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letter-Journal of George Canning, 1793&#150;1795</span>, ed. P. Jupp, 1991, 26), and secured him election as member of parliament for the Treasury borough of Hastings in July 1798. Although Sturges was offered the under-secretaryship at the Home Office in Addington's administration, loyalty to Canning led him to decline. By 1802 he had added George Rose to his circle of political intimates, and was returned with Rose as MP for Christchurch that year.<br>
<br>In 1803 Sturges inherited &pound;2000 p.a. from his uncle Francis Bourne, and happily concurred with the stipulation that he take the name Bourne, whereupon Canning promptly dubbed him &#145;Scroggs&#146;, by which nickname he became generally known in Canningite circles. When Pitt returned to office in 1804 Sturges Bourne became secretary to the Treasury. Relinquishing office in January 1806 following Pitt's death, he returned to public office under Portland as a lord of the Treasury from March 1807 to September 1809, eventually following Canning out of office. On 2 February 1808 he married Anne, daughter of Oldfield Bowles of North Aston, Oxfordshire. Their only child, Ann, was born a year later. After the general election of 1812 Sturges Bourne found himself without a seat, and became increasingly active in county politics in his native Hampshire, serving as chairman of the Hampshire quarter sessions between 1817 and 1822. His return to parliament was again secured by Canning, who insisted that he become a privy councillor (10 August 1814), and an Irish borough open to government nominees, Bandon Bridge, returned Sturges Bourne on 24 March 1815. He held the seat until 1818, when he was again returned for Christchurch. Although loyal to Canning, and firmly committed to Catholic emancipation, he was a comfortable supporter of the Liverpool administration. From September 1814 he served as an unpaid commissioner on the Board of Control, and in June 1818 he was elevated to a salaried commission, an office he held until February 1822.<br>
<br>Between 1817 and 1819 Sturges Bourne was responsible for the most ambitious attempt to reform the poor laws undertaken between 1601 and 1834. As early as November 1801 he had introduced a bill to end the badging of paupers, and in 1807 he successfully opposed Samuel Whitbread's elaborate scheme to reform the poor laws and popular education. In 1817 Sturges Bourne was nominated to a select committee on the poor laws, and in February 1818 assumed its chairmanship. The committee's reports stopped short of recommending abolition of poor relief, the currently orthodox view among political economists, and instead recommended major reform. Although the government was opposed to reform, in 1818 and 1819 Sturges Bourne sponsored a series of bills transforming the administration of poor relief and parish government. Two acts facilitated the appointment of salaried assistant overseers, the establishment of select vestries, and regular minute-keeping in all parish vestries. An act passed in 1819 transformed the local franchise, awarding ratepayers one vote for the first &pound;50 of rateable value and an additional vote for each further &pound;25 of rateable value, up to a maximum of six votes. The <span class="roman">Sturges Bourne Acts</span> remained the basis of parish government until the passage of the <span class="roman">Parish Councils Act</span> in 1894.<br>
<br>In 1822 Sturges Bourne succeeded to a substantial fortune, and resigned from both the Board of Control and the chairmanship of Hampshire quarter sessions. He remained politically active, serving on the 1824 select committee on artisans and machinery which paved the way for the abolition of the <span class="roman">Combination Acts</span>, and sat as MP for Ashburton from 1826 until 1830. Sturges Bourne's lifelong association with Canning reached its climax when Canning appointed him home secretary (he served from April to July 1827). Sturges Bourne's reluctance to accept major office was notorious, and he accepted the seals after prevaricating for a fortnight with Canning's insisting to him on 26 April 1827 that, &#145;My Administration WHOLLY depends on your helping me for two months as Home Secretary of State&#146;  (Aspinall, <span class="italic">Formation of Canning's Ministry</span>, 186). Sturges Bourne was as good as his commission, moving to the Office of Woods and Forests when Lansdowne joined the administration. On Canning's death the king sent for Goderich, as his principal political associate, and for Sturges Bourne, Canning's most intimate friend. As Goderich vainly sought to construct a viable administration, the chancellorship of the exchequer was offered twice to Sturges Bourne, who turned it down, much to the dismay of Huskisson, who even accused him of destroying the chances of forming a coherent ministry. Sturges Bourne resigned woods and forests when Wellington assumed the premiership in February 1828. Although he supported Catholic emancipation, and moderate parliamentary reform, he nevertheless opposed the scale and tendency of the <span class="roman">Whig Reform Bill</span>, and resigned his seat (Milborne Port, which he had held since 1830) in March 1831. His daughter described his resignation as the product of &#145;his reluctance to oppose Government in a measure on which their existence, and perhaps our very safety depend, and an equal reluctance to give up the opinions of a lifetime&#146;  (Ann Sturges Bourne to Marianne Dyson, 7 March 1831, Hampshire RO, Sturges Bourne&#150;Dyson correspondence, 9M55/F).<br>
<br>Resignation from parliament did not involve retirement from public life. Between 1832 and 1834 Sturges Bourne was an active member of the royal commission on the poor laws, did much to diminish hostility to poor-law reform in London vestries, and finally returned to active involvement in the Hampshire quarter sessions after 1835. He thought Peel's behaviour in office 1834&#150;5 &#145;very judicious&#146;. Although a liberal tory, Sturges Bourne was deeply hostile to whigs and whiggism, even describing Lord Althorp as a republican at heart. In his diary for 18 April 1833, E. J. Littleton recalled that Sturges Bourne &#145;was a great alarmist. His friend Canning used to invent absurd stories to excite his apprehensions&#146;  (Aspinall, <span class="italic">Three Early &hellip; Diaries</span>). Sturges Bourne died at Testwood House, near Southampton, on 1 February 1845 and was buried in Winchester Cathedral.<br>
