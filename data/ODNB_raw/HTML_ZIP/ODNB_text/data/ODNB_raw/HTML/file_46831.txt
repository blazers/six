<span class="headword">Cockshut,  John</span>  (1837&#150;1912), <span class="occ">wallpaper manufacturer</span>, was born on 4 November 1837 at Tong with Haulgh, near Bolton, Lancashire, the eldest son of John Cockshut, plumber and glazier, and his wife, Alice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bromiley).<br>
<br>Cockshut is known largely for his contribution to the British wallpaper industry. His involvement began when, aged eight, he went to work for C. H. and E. Potter of Darwen, where mechanization was pioneered. Details of any formal education and of the nature of his work at Potters remain unknown but he was probably employed initially in the production of handblock-printed wallpapers. Apart from a short break at a cotton mill, Cockshut, joined later by his brother, James, remained there until he was about twenty, when they joined their uncle (formerly cashier at Potters) in his own firm, Lightbown, Aspinall &amp; Co., at Pendleton, near Manchester.<br>
<br>Under Lightbown's direction, John Cockshut's commercial acumen and genial but shrewd salesmanship, and his brother's talents as a designer and colourist made them a formidable team. The firm grew dramatically, warehouses were opened in Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow, London, and Leipzig, and Cockshut became Lightbown's first manager at the Cannon Street warehouse in London, although he continued to collaborate with his brother on special machine-printed collections for overseas markets and new ranges for the home trade. Under his regime, a large export trade was established, particularly with Australia and other colonies. Subsequently he was joined by his son, Harry.<br>
<br>In 1888 the Cockshuts left Lightbowns, having acquired John Allan &amp; Sons, an established wallpaper firm with a factory at Old Ford, east London. It became Allan, Cockshut &amp; Co. and, determined to expand, Cockshut extended the premises substantially, subsuming the original mill in a new factory 400 feet long. Under his direction, the business flourished: within a few years the workforce had increased from 140 to 600, turnover had quadrupled, and output rivalled that of major manufacturers. In 1896 Cockshut embarked on the development of a range of raised decorations for walls and ceilings, a venture which proved highly successful despite intense competition.<br>
<br>In 1899 Cockshut played a major role in the amalgamation of thirty-one firms into the Wall Paper Manufacturers Ltd, which controlled more than 98 per cent of the UK wallpaper trade and rapidly became one of the largest firms in the British economy, with capital of &pound;14.14 million and, by 1903, 3400 employees. John, James, and Harry Cockshut joined the board and John served as chairman from 1901 to 1903.<br>
<br>By 1904 Allan, Cockshut &amp; Co. was producing 10 million rolls of wallpaper annually, largely as a result of the entrepreneurial flair and vigour of John Cockshut. He had a talent for selecting staff and maintaining good relations with the workforce, and emphasized the importance of establishing good relationships with customers, which paid off when his son returned from Australia with the biggest single order for wallpaper recorded. But it was his ability to make use of new technology and ideas, and his experience both of manufacturing and worldwide distribution, which enabled him to increase his firm's share when market conditions became difficult. However, his brother's death in 1905, followed by that of Harry, his only son, in 1909, were severe personal blows and, although he continued to direct the business, aided by his two nephews, he never fully recovered from Harry's death.<br>
<br>Both brothers were dedicated to wallpaper manufacture, regarding it as their hobby as well as their business, but they were also avid collectors of pictures, <i>objets d'art</i>, and, in particular, S&egrave;vres, Chelsea, and Worcester porcelain. John Cockshut's was considered to be one of the finest private collections in existence and parts of it were displayed in several international exhibitions, including the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904)&#151;for which the items in his display were valued at &pound;30,000&#151;and the Franco-British Exhibition (1908). Four watercolours were presented by him to the Atkinson Art Gallery, Southport, which he visited frequently, and his reputation as a generous benefactor extended to his local Presbyterian church in Willesden, which he helped to found and where he was an elder and deacon. He donated the organ and a house in Craven Park, which he presented as a manse. He was made a JP in 1895.<br>
<br>John Cockshut married his first wife, Alice Cheetham, before 1865 and was survived by his second, Leah. In addition to Harry, there were five daughters. Cockshut died at Glenmore, 243 Willesden Lane, London, on 11 November 1912. His funeral took place at Willesden on 14 November 1912.<br>
