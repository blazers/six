<span class="headword">Watson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1686), <span class="occ">ejected minister</span>, was recorded as &#145;of Yorkshire&#146; when he matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1635; no more can be said of his background and early years. At Cambridge he was noted for being a &#145;hard student&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.188). He graduated BA in 1639 and MA in 1642, acting after this as a chaplain to the puritan Lady Vere. In 1646 he was at the City church of St Stephen Walbrook, probably as a lecturer. In 1649 he signed the <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, disclaiming implication in the king's execution. In 1651 he was involved with several others in Love's plot to recall Charles II; he was imprisoned but returned to St Stephen's in 1652. Watson married Abigail Beadle (<i>b</i>. 1627), daughter of the Essex puritan minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1793/', "John Beadle")</script>. Between 1648 and 1660 the baptisms of five sons and two daughters are recorded at St Stephen's, to be followed by the melancholy toll of four burials. After his ejection a further daughter was buried at St Stephen's in 1672 (and also a son at Enfield), and at St Stephen's, it seems, his wife was buried in 1692.<br>
<br>At the beginning of Watson's time at St Stephen's, Ralph Robinson was the rector, and represented the classis in the London provincial assembly in 1652 and 1653, becoming moderator in November 1654. Watson was meanwhile an assessor of the provincial assembly and scribe of the third classis. On 3 November 1656, however, Watson was returned to the provincial assembly representing the third London classis. He attended sporadically and on 1 August 1660 was present at the penultimate meeting. The likelihood, therefore, is that Watson became rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the place of Robinson in 1655 or 1656. In 1662 he was ejected from the rectory of St Stephen. In 1665 he was reported by an informer as holding a conventicle at his house in the Minories. Nevertheless, he continued his ministry in London at various conventicles, including a well-equipped meeting-house in Bishopsgate. In 1671 and 1677 Mary, countess of Warwick, heard him preach in Essex. Under the declaration of indulgence he was licensed to preach at his house in Dowgate; his congregation later moved to Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate. In November 1681 Watson was one of several London ministers prosecuted and fined for holding conventicles, and he was presented again in April 1683. Another aspect of his ministry was that he kept a school at Bethnal Green, whose students wrote to Baxter of their reverence for him.<br>
<br>Watson died in 1686 and was buried on 28 July at Barnston, Essex, in the same grave as his father-in-law, John Beadle, the ejected minister there. According to Henry Newcome he &#145;died poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 2.276). This is borne out by the fact that in 1684 Baxter paid him &pound;2 out of the &pound;50 fund he had been given by the earl of Bedford to distribute to poor ministers  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 1128).<br>
<br>Watson was a prolific writer whose work went into many editions in his own century and later. His early literary output was exhortatory and devotional rather than didactic; even when the occasion arose for a topical sermon, as at the Restoration, he rejected it. His <span class="italic">Discourses</span> was addressed to the godly and does not, for the most part, concern itself with doubts or threats. It is primarily meditational, at times even mystical, and often expressed in ecstatic language. <span class="italic">The Christian's Charter</span> (1652) is a paean on the privileges and delights of the Christian; <i>inter alia</i> it describes the Christian's resurrection body as &#145;enamelled with glory&#146;  (Watson, <span class="italic">Discourses</span>, 1.79). This leads logically to <span class="italic">A Christian on the Mount, or, A Treatise on Meditation</span> described as &#145;the chamber of delight &hellip; the soul's retiring on itself &hellip; the wing of the soul&#146;  (ibid., 1.199). <span class="italic">Christ's Loveliness</span> of 1657 was Watson's own meditation on the <span class="roman">Canticles</span>: &#145;the whole book is bespangled with the praises of Christ&#146;  (ibid., 1.295). The same year saw a long treatise, <span class="italic">The Character of a Godly Man</span>, which included sections on &#145;helps to perseverance&#146;, and &#145;an answer to those that doubt their salvation&#146;. Lastly, the longest discourse was on Christ's sermon on the mount, seen as an exemplar of the minister's preaching: &#145;when ministers are upon the mount, let them not be on the rocks&#146;  (ibid., 2.35).<br>
<br>Watson's <i>magnum opus</i> was published posthumously in 1692. This was <span class="italic">A Body of Practical Divinity</span>, sermons on the shorter catechism of the Westminster assembly, a massive work of some 880 quarto pages. Unlike many puritan writings which started as a sermon and expanded into a book, these bear the marks of being sermons. They are short, oratorical in style, and exhibit a happy turn of phrase. Each starts with a tabulated exposition, amply supported from scripture, of the passage from the catechism, followed by a number of &#145;uses&#146;&#151;the application of the doctrine. These are interspersed with &#145;objections&#146; to clarify difficult points or move the argument forward. There are recurring passages which show Watson's priorities and the typical emphases and problems of Calvinist belief. There is a forthright statement of God's election to salvation: &#145;they were not elected because they believed, but believed because they were elected &hellip; The book of God's decree hath no errata in it, no blottings out, once justified never unjustified&#146;  (Watson, <span class="italic">Body of Practical Divinity</span>, 42). This position is often repeated, but equally often Watson addresses the problem of assurance and answers the questions of those who doubt their salvation: &#145;I fear the kingdom of grace is not yet come into my heart &hellip; I fear the plough of the law hath not yet gone deep enough, therefore I have not grace&#146;. Watson's recurring counter to these doubts is that &#145;a weak faith is not to be despised&#146;; a weak faith is still true faith and may be growing. He is wont to offer advice strange in the context of election: &#145;let us above all things labour for forgiveness of sins&#146;; &#145;let them labour to find grace &hellip; take pains for it&#146;  (ibid., 128, 152, 387). In practice this meant the formula of frequent prayer, meditation, and reading of scripture, coupled with attendance at the &#145;ordinances&#146; of the church. Here one can see the pastor in Watson seeking to square the circle of a fixed belief in double predestination and the doubts and troubles of his flock. A recurring concern is the sufferings of the elect. These are to &#145;expectorate and purge our sins&#146;  (ibid., 445ff.); as such they are &#145;love tokens&#146;  (ibid., 529) from God. In general Watson has an apocalyptic view of his world: &#145;we live in the dregs of time &hellip; England has a kachexy; it is all over disease&#146;  (ibid., 371). The picture which emerges is that of a godly man, devoted to his pastoral ministry. Calamy has a story which partly encapsulates this summary:<blockquote>once on a lecture day Bishop Richardson came to hear him, who was much pleased with his sermon, but especially with the prayer after it, so that he followed him home to give him thanks, and earnestly desired a copy of it. &#145;Alas (said Mr Watson) that is what I cannot give, for I do not use to pen my prayers; it was no studied thing, but uttered <i>pro re nata</i>, as God enabled me, from the abundance of my heart and affections&#146;. Upon which the good bishop went away wondering that any man could pray in that manner extempore. (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.189)</blockquote>
