<span class="headword">Mason,  Kenneth</span>  (1887&#150;1976), <span class="occ">geographer and mountaineer</span>, was born on 10 September 1887, at Glenmore, Brighton Road, Sutton, Surrey, son of Stanley Engledue Mason, merchant, and Ellen Martin Turner. He was educated at Cheltenham and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. At Cheltenham, he set his heart on the survey of India after reading Francis Younghusband's <span class="italic">Heart of a Continent</span>. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1906, and spent two years at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, where he worked on the development of stereoplotting machines.<br>
<br>Mason was posted to Karachi to join the survey of India in 1909, and spent several years surveying in Kashmir. There he taught himself to ski, and he once considered himself the first person to bring skis to India. He also climbed many of the peaks between the Sind, Liddar, and Warwan valleys. In 1911&#150;12, he climbed the highest peaks of the Kolahoi group (17,799 ft) with his shikari, Abdulla Bhat, and Ernest Neve, a medical missionary. After a colleague's death in 1912, he took over an extended survey of the Taghdumbash Pamir intended to link previous Indian and Russian surveys. With Captain R. W. G. Hingston, a doctor, and several Gurkha soldiers and Hunza porters, he spent 1913 in arduous work plotting peaks in the western Karakoram using stereoscopic photography.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Mason, by this time a captain, served in France (1914&#150;15), where he was wounded at Loos, and in Mesopotamia (1916&#150;18), where he was awarded the Military Cross during the relief of Kut. In the Tigris corps, he was promoted brevet major, thrice mentioned in dispatches, and became chief intelligence officer. On 25 June 1917 he married Dorothy Helen (1893/4&#150;1974), daughter of Captain Arthur Robinson, Royal Engineers, at the garrison church of St George, Aldershot, Hampshire. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>After the war, Mason returned to India, and was disappointed not to be chosen for the early Everest expeditions. He began research in the records of the survey of India and published many papers on the history of surveying. In 1926 he led an expedition to survey the remote Shaksgam valley and the Aghil ranges in the Karakoram, areas that Younghusband visited in 1887. For this work, the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) awarded him the Cuthbert Peek grant in 1926, and the founder's gold medal in 1927. In 1928 he was appointed assistant surveyor-general of India, and, in 1929, deputy director of surveys. In 1928 he co-founded the Himalayan Club in Delhi, and its publication, the <span class="italic">Himalayan Journal</span>, became under his editorship from 1929 to 1945 an authoritative record of mountaineering in the Himalayas. He was superintendent of the survey of India in Burma during 1931&#150;2.<br>
<br>Oxford had had a reader in geography (jointly funded by the university and the RGS) since 1887, a school of geography since 1899, and a graduate diploma in geography since 1900, but by the end of the Second World War the subject languished. It had few supporters within the university from either natural scientists or those in favour of &#145;modern humanities&#146;, and outside it its diploma holders faced stiff competition from geography graduates from other universities. By 1930 there were just seven candidates for the diploma, and numbers for the biennial summer school were also shrinking. In 1928 the committee for geography renewed its call for an honours degree in geography at Oxford and the university responded in 1930 by establishing a new honours school and a new chair, the first holder of which was Mason (1932&#150;53). Mason retired as lieutenant-colonel to take up the chair and a fellowship of Hertford College. Although he had strong backing from the RGS, Mason was by no means an obvious choice for a department seeking to re-establish its academic credentials. In some ways he proved surprisingly successful. During his term of office the school was a success in numerical terms: it was first examined in 1933, by 1939 it had thirty-nine, or 4 per cent, of both men and women honours finalists, and it continued to grow rapidly after the end of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Mason also revitalized the links between geography at Oxford and practical service. These had begun with the RGS's involvement in the establishment of the discipline at Oxford and were fostered by Halford Mackinder and particularly his successor, A. J. Herbertson. Under Mason, with his extensive contacts in the military services, government, the city, and the RGS, the school consolidated its practical focus, linked to regional planning, surveying, exploration, teaching, and colonial service. A notable product was the Admiralty handbooks produced during the war when the school became an intelligence unit. Mason also had ambitious plans for establishing a geographical research institute partially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation: but although during his term of office the school's library grew, a large lecture hall was built, and the staff expanded, plans for a research institute, a second chair in geography, and a chair of planning attached to the geography school failed. Mason's own publications, such as they were, were wholly devoted to surveying and mountaineering and, except for Marjorie Sweeting, the staff he appointed were products of the Oxford school with little commitment to research and publication. The school was thus ill-equipped to conduct research of the type which was beginning in both other Oxford schools and other British geography departments.<br>
<br>Mason served the RGS as a council member (1932&#150;45 and 1952&#150;4), vice-president (1937&#150;42), and briefly as acting president. He also served on the committee organizing the Everest expeditions from 1933 to 1940 and during this period the India Office frequently consulted him when deciding who should be given permission to scale peaks in the Himalayas. During the Second World War Mason was active in the inter-services topographical intelligence department located at Oxford, organized a series of <span class="italic">Admiralty Handbooks</span> on overseas countries, and co-authored a volume for naval intelligence on western Arabia and the Red Sea. After his retirement from Oxford in 1953, he published his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">Abode of Snow</span> (1955), a valuable and encyclopaedic history of surveying and climbing in the Himalayas that epitomizes the early twentieth-century view of mountaineering as exploration and conveys the allure of &#145;blanks on the map&#146;.<br>
<br>Mason was also freeman of the Drapers' Company, City of London, and elected master in 1949. He was made an honorary fellow of the RGS (1965), honorary member of the Alpine Club (1973) and the French Alpine Club (1930), and an honorary fellow of Hertford College (1953). In the 1970s he was one of the interviewees for the BBC's oral history <span class="italic">Plain Tales from the Raj</span>. Contemporaries admired him as an attractive and accurate writer, an efficient administrator with a gruff military bearing, and as energetic, kindly, and generous. He died of renal failure and coronary thrombosis on 2 June 1976 at his home, Sylvanway, West End Road, Mortimer West End, Hampshire.<br>
