<span class="headword">Clarke,  Peter William Hanwell</span>  (1948&#150;2007), <span class="occ">social worker and children's commissioner</span>, was born on 7 October 1948 at the Maternity Home, Oxford Road, Llandudno, Caernarvonshire, the son of William Arthur Clarke, a captain in the army, and his wife, Jean Barbara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanwell. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 2 Abbey Road, Llandudno. He attended fourteen schools, owing to his father's peripatetic life. He withdrew from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after six months when he realized he was only doing what was expected of him and started work as an untrained social worker at Stamford remand centre, London, before reading philosophy and politics at Sussex University, while working in an old people's home at night. He then graduated MA in philosophy, again at Sussex. After qualifying as a social worker at Warwick University he became a field social worker in London and Brighton. In 1985 he joined the Spastics Society as a community care adviser. In 1987 he married Jennifer Mary (Jenny) Thompson; they had two sons, Liam and Bryn.<br>
<br>Clarke moved back to Wales in 1991 to become the first director of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship Wales. In 1995 he became head of ChildLine Cymru, a twenty-four hour helpline for children. His own childhood gave him empathy with many of the children with whom he worked. There had been, he admitted, &#145;difficulties&#146; about which he preferred not to speak. This personal attachment to those with whom he worked was perhaps allowed its fullest expression when, in March 2001, he was appointed children's commissioner for Wales, the first children's commissioner in the UK.<br>
<br>Between 1997 and 2000 an inquiry headed by Sir Ronald Waterhouse had investigated abuse in children's homes in north Wales and its report recommended that such a post be created. Countries in Europe and elsewhere had established children's ombudsmen (the first post was created in Norway in 1981) but the idea had been rejected by successive UK governments. Following the Waterhouse report the government relented (but stipulated that the commissioner and his staff be funded by the Welsh Assembly). After the Welsh post came into being others followed in Scotland in 2004 and Northern Ireland in 2007. In 2005 a children's commissioner's role was created in England but in a far more circumscribed form. Clarke's passion, and his involvement of children and young people in his job, underpinned by his independence and considerable powers, set the tone for the others.<br>
<br>As well as the more obvious children's issues&#151;health, education, and social services&#151;Clarke was charged with considering planning, transport, the environment, economic development, and rural affairs. He also had the power to consider and make representations to the Welsh Assembly on any matter he deemed to affect children's rights and welfare in Wales. When &#145;listening to children&#146; was too often honoured in the breach than the practice, Clarke showed consistently how children and young people could influence services for the better (he pioneered using children for the commission's appointments panels). He used the means by which children and young people communicated&#151;including emails, message boards, and texting by mobile phone&#151;to draw them in. He set up an advice line that children could call any time.<br>
<br>Clarke was tireless in his advocacy of children's rights. In 2004 he said that an additional &pound;700,000 for what were then the new child and adolescent mental health services in Wales was welcome but &#145;totally inadequate&#146; in the face of the growing crisis in provision  (<span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 19 Nov 2004). Just before he died he was threatening legal action against the assembly on how it took decisions about children. In <span class="italic">Telling Concerns</span> (2003) he reviewed social services departments, and he produced practice guides on whistleblowing, children's advocacy, and children's complaints, as well as training materials. Like his other publications, these were written in formats accessible to children and young people. His major inquiry was the &#145;Clywch&#146; inquiry (<i>clywch</i>, significantly, being the Welsh command to listen) into child sexual abuse at Rhydfelen secondary school. This was published in 2004 and resulted in new safeguards for children in Wales and influenced thinking elsewhere in the UK. In addition to his work in Wales Clarke was involved at a UK level with the Family Justice Council and other bodies, and was president of the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children (ENOC) in 2005&#150;6. He was also a board member of Voices from Care.<br>
<br>Young people were frequently characterized, Clarke opined, as &#145;angels or demons and rarely as human beings&#146;  (<span class="italic">South Wales Evening Post</span>, 21 May 2005). He believed that the failure of systems, procedures, and professionals stemmed from a failure to allow the needs and rights of children and young people the same importance as those of adults. By making respect the foundation of his own work he provided a model of a children's advocate and of a good service for children. Even after being diagnosed with lung cancer he remained fully committed to his role and continued to speak up for children's rights. He died at Ty Bryngwyn Hospice, Prince Philip Hospital, Llanelli, on 21 January 2007, and was survived by his wife, Jenny, and their two sons.<br>
