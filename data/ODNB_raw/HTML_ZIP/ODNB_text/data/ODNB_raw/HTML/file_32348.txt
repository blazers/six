<span class="headword">Chamberlain, Sir  Crawford Trotter</span>  (1821&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in London on 9 May 1821, the third son of Sir Henry Chamberlain, first baronet, sometime consul-general and charg&eacute; d'affaires in Brazil, and his second wife, Anne Eugenia, daughter of William Morgan of London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32352/', "Sir Neville Bowles Chamberlain")</script> was an elder brother.<br>
<br>After education at private schools and under tutors Crawford obtained a cadetship in the Bengal army in 1837, and was posted to the 28th Bengal native infantry. He was transferred to the 16th Bengal native infantry, and with the outbreak of the First Anglo-Afghan War he began his active service. He was present at the siege of Ghazni (23 July 1839) and at the operations around Kandahar. In September 1841 he was appointed to command the 5th Janbaz cavalry, and in October he became adjutant of Christie's Horse. Until the end of the Afghan campaign he was engaged in constant and severe fighting. In 1843 he was sent to Sind with two squadrons of Christie's Horse as an independent command, to be known as Chamberlain's Horse.<br>
<br>In 1845 Chamberlain was invalided to the Cape, where he married Elizabeth, daughter of J. de Witt. She died on 19 January 1894. He returned to India in 1846 as second in command of the 9th irregular cavalry, into which his own regiment had been absorbed. During the Anglo-Sikh wars (1845&#150;9) he was constantly in action. He was at the battle of Chilianwala on 13 January 1849. On 30 January he was again engaged in the neighbourhood; he was wounded, and was the subject of a special dispatch by Lord Gough (31 January). At the battle of Gujrat on 21 February, he had to be lifted into the saddle, where he remained throughout the day. He was mentioned in dispatches, and, being promoted captain and brevet major in November 1849, was given the command of the 1st irregular cavalry, formerly Skinner's Horse. He served with it in the Mohmand expedition of 1854.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the mutiny in 1857 Chamberlain displayed courage and resolution. The force of his influence and the discipline in his regiment were manifest when his men, in the midst of mutiny, suspected and overt, volunteered to shoot condemned rebels at Jullundur (4 June 1857). Chamberlain, although not the senior officer on the spot, was entrusted with the dangerous duty of disarming the 62nd and 69th regiments at Multan. He did this on 11 June with &#145;an extraordinary mixture of audacity and skill&#146;. Sir John Lawrence in his report declared that the disarming at Multan was a turning point in the Punjab crisis, second only in importance to the disarming at Lahore and Peshawar. At Cheekawutne in September Chamberlain was attacked by an overwhelming force, and was compelled to take the unusual course of securing his cavalry in a caravanserai. Chamberlain was sick, but he succeeded in maintaining the defence, until he was relieved three days later.<br>
<br>For his services in the mutiny Chamberlain was promoted lieutenant-colonel, a reward generally regarded as inadequate. The oversight was admitted and rectified long afterwards. In April 1862 he was made colonel, in 1864 he was appointed honorary aide-de-camp to the governor-general, and two years later was made CSI, and was included in the first list of twelve officers for a good-service pension. In 1866, too, he was transferred to the command of the Central India horse, and the next year to the command of the Gwalior district with the rank of brigadier-general. In 1869 he was officiating political agent at Gwalior, and received the thanks of government. From October 1869 to February 1870 he was acting political agent at the court of Sindhia until his promotion to major-general.<br>
<br>During his unemployed time as major-general Chamberlain served on various commissions and courts of inquiry, and from 1874 to 1879 he commanded the Oudh division. He became lieutenant-general in October 1877 and general in January 1880. In that year he returned to England for the first time since 1837; with the exception of his visit to the Cape, he had never left India in the interval. In 1884 he was retired from the active list. In 1896 he married for the second time; his second wife was Augusta Margaret, daughter of Major-General John Christie. She survived him; there were no children from either marriage. In 1897 he was made GCIE. Sir Crawford, who retained his splendid physique until near the end, died at his residence, Lordswood, near Southampton, Hampshire, on 13 December 1902, and was buried at Rownhams.<br>
