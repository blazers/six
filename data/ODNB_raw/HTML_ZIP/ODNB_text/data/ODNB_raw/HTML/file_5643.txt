<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Augustus William James</span>, first baronet  (1788&#150;1877), <span class="occ">naval officer and court official</span>, was born abroad on 26 May 1788, the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58758/', "William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire (1748&#150;1811)")</script>, and Lady Elizabeth Foster (1757&#150;1824) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4930/', "Cavendish, Elizabeth Christiana")</script>], daughter of the fourth earl of Bristol and wife of John Thomas Foster MP (<i>d</i>. 1796); she married Cavendish on 19 October 1809. He was educated at Harrow School (1796&#150;9). Throughout his career he benefited from the generosity of his half-brother, the sixth duke, who settled &pound;2000 a year on him on their father's death in 1811, and an even more generous settlement at his marriage in 1813. He entered the navy as a midshipman in May 1800, under the auspices of Earl Spencer, then first lord of the Admiralty, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in 1806. He served at the capture of St Lucia and Tobago in 1803, and throughout the operations in Egypt during 1807, and was involved in the capture of a convoy in the Bay of Rosas in 1809 (for which he received a medal), and in the operations on the coast of Italy in 1811 and 1812. After this, as captain, he was for many years actively employed in naval duties, being several times mentioned in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> for his courage in cutting-out expeditions and on other occasions. For some time he was in attendance on the lord high admiral, the duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV), and in 1828 he took Lord William Bentinck as governor-general to India. This was his last service afloat, and he was not actively employed after 1831.<br>
<br>Clifford obtained the rank of rear-admiral in 1848, vice-admiral in 1855, admiral of the blue on 7 November 1860, and admiral of the red in 1864, becoming retired admiral on 31 March 1866. He was whig MP for the duke of Devonshire's Irish pocket boroughs: Bandon Bridge (1818&#150;20), Dungarvan (1820&#150;22), and Bandon Bridge again (23 July 1831 to 3 December 1832). He was nominated CB on 8 December 1815, knighted on 4 August 1830, and created a baronet on 4 August 1838.<br>
<br>The duke of Devonshire, then lord chamberlain, appointed Clifford on 25 July 1832 gentleman usher of the black rod, which office he held, much to his satisfaction, until his death. On various occasions between 1843 and 1866 he acted as deputy lord great chamberlain of England, in the absence of Lord Willoughby d'Eresby. He was a patron of the arts, and formed a collection of paintings, sculpture, etchings, engravings, and <i>bijouterie</i>. He died at his residence, Royal Court, in the House of Lords on 8 February 1877.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1813, Clifford had married Lady Elizabeth Frances Townshend, sister of John, fourth Marquess Townshend. She was born on 2 August 1789, and died at Nice on 10 April 1862. They had three sons and two daughters; Captain William John Cavendish Clifford RN (1814&#150;1882) succeeded his father as second baronet. The baronetcy became extinct in 1895.<br>
