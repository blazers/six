<span class="headword">Perry,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">traveller and medical writer</span>, studied medicine at Leiden and graduated from Utrecht on 5 February 1723. Between 1739 and 1742 he travelled in France and Italy, and in the Middle East he visited Constantinople, Egypt, Palestine, and Greece. On his return he published a <span class="italic">View of the Levant, particularly of Constantinople, Syria, Egypt and Greece in which their antiquities, government, politics, maxims, manners and customs &hellip; are described</span> (1743). This was an important early work on Egypt; it contained much interesting information particularly on Upper Egypt, which until then was relatively little known. The handsome volume was illustrated with thirty-three fine plates engraved by George Bickham the younger, a noted contemporary engraver. In the preface Perry admitted to having bought some representations of the carvings, though he did verify their accuracy in person. The scale plans of various temples were, however, his own work. The work was dedicated to John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, whom he had met in the Levant; he, like Perry, made something of a name for himself as a traveller and antiquary, bringing back new information from the region. Through Sandwich, who evidently continued to notice Perry after their return, Perry's volume attracted a large and distinguished list of subscribers. In it he described a mummy which was later acquired by Richard Cosway, and then by Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, who in turn described it in his <span class="italic">History of Egyptian Mummies</span> (1834). Perry's <span class="italic">View</span> was translated into German and reissued in English.<br>
<br>Perry practised as a physician in Norwich and perhaps Canterbury after his return to Britain in 1742, and both before and after his visit to the Middle East published extensively on medical subjects, particularly on spa waters. Perry died in 1780 and was buried at the east end of the nave of Norwich Cathedral. His elder brother was buried in 1795 near to him.<br>
<br>This Charles Perry has been often confused with a second <a name="cosubject_21990"></a><span class="headword">Charles Perry</span>  (1698/9&#150;1730), <span class="occ">physician</span>, who was born in Norwich and baptized there in the church of St Peter Mancroft on 23 October 1699 and was the younger son of John Perry, a Norwich attorney, and his wife, Francis. He spent four years at Mr Pate's school in Norwich and four years following at Mr Tuke's school at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. On 28 May 1717 he was admitted at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a pensioner, was a scholar in 1717&#150;22, and graduated MB in 1722 and MD in 1727. He was a junior fellow of the college from Michaelmas 1723 to his death. He practised in Norwich and Cambridge. His will was dated 4 March 1730 and was proved at Norwich on 18 December 1730. In it he expressed his wish to be buried with his father in St Peter Mancroft, Norwich.<br>
