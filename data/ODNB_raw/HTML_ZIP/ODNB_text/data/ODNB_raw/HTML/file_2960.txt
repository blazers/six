<span class="headword">Botfield,  Beriah</span>  (1807&#150;1863), <span class="occ">antiquary and industrialist</span>, was born at Earl's Ditton, Shropshire, on 5 March 1807, the eldest son of Beriah Botfield (1768&#150;1813) of Norton Hall, Northamptonshire, and Charlotte, daughter of William Withering MD. Botfield was educated first at Harrow School, where he subsequently established a medal for the encouragement of foreign languages, and then privately. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1824, and graduated BA in 1828. He became MP for Ludlow in 1840 and held his seat until 1847 when he was defeated. In 1857 he was again returned for that borough and held the seat until his death; he was a liberal conservative, and described as one &#145;who wanted to promote &#147;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWBMP</span>, 41). From 1850 he alone controlled the Shropshire collieries and ironworks that were the basis of the Botfield fortune. The family's foundry at Old Park was once the second largest in England. Botfield married Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1911), second daughter of Sir Baldwin Leighton, bt, on 21 October 1858, at Alberbury, Shropshire. There were no children.<br>
<br>Botfield produced a number of volumes that reflected his interests in early printed books and manuscripts. His <span class="italic">Notes on Cathedral Libraries of England</span> (1849) contained the fruits of much careful examination of what were then little-examined collections. His edition of <span class="italic">Catalogues of the Library of Durham Cathedral</span> (1840, for the Surtees Society) is also of value. He edited a number of other works: for the Roxburghe Club (of which he was a member), <span class="italic">Manners and Household Expenses of England in the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Centuries</span> (1841; this edition has also been attributed to T. H. Turner); for the Maitland Club, John Row's <span class="italic">History of the Kirk of Scotland, 1558&#150;1637</span> (1842); for the Abbotsford Club, Gilbert Hay's translation of <span class="italic">The Buke of Order of Knyghthood</span> (1847); and, for the Bannatyne Club, <span class="italic">Original Letters on Ecclesiastical Affairs of Scotland</span> (1851). He also contributed various articles to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Philobiblon Miscellany</span>. He set up a private printing press at Norton Hall and printed some of his own writings there in limited editions, including his account of the genealogy of the family of Boteville or Botfield, <span class="italic">Stemmata Botevilliana</span> (1843) and excerpts from the catalogue of the library of Thomas Hearne, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Hearneiana</span> (1848).<br>
<br>Botfield was also a notable book collector, one sufficiently distinguished to be elected a member of the Roxburghe Club. He died at his London home in Grosvenor Square on 7 August 1863, and his collection, primarily of early printed and colour plate books, often in sumptuous bindings, passed on his death to the Thynne family of Bath, with whom he claimed relationship on no very compelling grounds. His widow, Isabella, married Alfred Seymour on 18 August 1866. Most of Botfield's books, which included a number of Caxtons and other incunabula, remained at Longleat, the Thynne family home, although some were sold at sales at Sothebys (11 June 1979) and Christies (30 March 1994). His collection of paintings, mainly Dutch landscapes, also remained at Longleat, largely intact. Botfield produced a catalogue of his picture collection in 1848.<br>
