<span class="headword">Porter,  Whitworth</span>  (1827&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of Henry Porter of Winslade House, near Exeter, was born at Winslade on 25 September 1827. His mother was Rose Aylmer, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24311/', "Sir Henry Russell, bt (1751&#150;1836)")</script>, judge of the supreme court of India. Porter entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on 14 November 1842, was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 18 December 1845, and was promoted first lieutenant on 1 April 1846. After a course of instruction at Chatham, he embarked for Dominica in the West Indies on 13 December 1847, having married in the preceding October. He returned home in March 1850, and was stationed at Limerick. He was promoted second captain on 3 January 1855. On 20 December 1853 he embarked for Malta, and in February 1855 was sent to the Crimea. He served in the trenches at the siege of Sevastopol until June. He received the Mejidiye (fifth class), and on 2 November 1855 was promoted brevet major. After serving at home for eighteen months, during which time he published <span class="italic">Life in the Trenches before Sebastopol</span> (1856), he returned to Malta in December 1856. There he studied Maltese history, and especially the knights of Malta, and subsequently published <span class="italic">A History of the Knights of Malta</span> (2 vols., 1858). On 2 April 1859 he was promoted first captain in the Royal Engineers, and returned to England.<br>
<br>Porter was employed at the War Office under the inspector-general of fortifications from April 1859 until September 1862 in connection with the defence of the United Kingdom. He served on the jury for the military division of the 1862 London international exhibition. He was instructor in fortification at Sandhurst from 1862 to 1868, was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 23 August 1866, and regimental lieutenant-colonel on 14 December 1868.<br>
<br>In March 1870 Porter was again sent to Malta, where, as executive officer under the commanding Royal Engineers, he supervised the construction of the defences of the new dockyard. While at Malta he was employed in connection with the expedition to Sicily to observe the eclipse in 1872, and he designed and erected observatories at Catania and Syracuse. He was promoted brevet colonel on 14 December 1873.<br>
<br>In February 1874 Porter was appointed commanding royal engineer at Barbados. He remained there two years, returning to England in April 1876, and was stationed for a time at Chatham. He was commanding royal engineer of the western district, and stationed at Plymouth from 1877 until 1 October 1881, when he retired on a pension, with the honorary rank of major-general.<br>
<br>After his retirement Porter interested himself in various charitable works connected with the order of St John of Jerusalem. He was chairman of the metropolitan district of the St John Ambulance Association, and also revised his <span class="italic">History of the Knights of Malta</span> (1883). The main work of his later years was the extensive <span class="italic">History of the Corps of Royal Engineers</span> (2 vols., 1889); he presented the copyright of this work to the corps.<br>
<br>Porter married in London, on 25 October 1847, Annie Shirley da Costa, and they had two children: Catherine, who married Captain Crosse, and Reginald da Costa, to whose memory Porter erected a handsome reredos at St Michael's Church, York Town, Surrey. The son, who became a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1871, won the gold medal of the Royal Engineers' Institute for a prize essay, &#145;Warfare against uncivilised races&#146;. He saw service in South Africa, and having passed first into the staff college in 1880, was on his way out to Egypt, where he had volunteered for service, when he was killed by a falling spar during a gale in 1882.<br>
<br>Porter died at Plymleigh, Nightingale Road, Guildford, on 27 May 1892, and was buried at St Michael's Church, York Town, of which he had been churchwarden for many years. He had contributed liberally towards its enlargement, and had himself carved the ornamental foliage on the chancel screen.<br>
