<span class="headword">Yeamans,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">royalist plotter</span>, came of a numerous Bristol family and was probably closely related to William Yeamans (1578&#150;1632?), a graduate of Balliol College, Oxford, incumbent of St Philip's, Bristol, where he was noted as a puritan and, from 1615 until his death, prebendary of Bristol Cathedral. Robert was a Merchant Venturer and councillor of Bristol, and in 1641&#150;2 served as sheriff.<br>
<br>Shortly before Bristol was garrisoned for parliament, Yeamans had received a commission from the king to raise troops there. In December 1642 the city was occupied by Colonel Essex, the command falling to Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes in February 1643. In March Yeamans acted belatedly in execution of his commission. He and his fellow Merchant Venturer George Butcher, or Bowcher, conceived a plan for betraying the city into the hands of Prince Rupert. The prince was to bring 4000 horse and 2000 foot to Durdham Down, and the royalists in Bristol, who were estimated at 2000 were to seize the Frome gate and admit Rupert's forces. The plot was to take effect on the night of 7 March 1643; but Fiennes heard of it, and on that day Yeamans and his principal confederates were arrested in his house in Wine Street. On 8 May Yeamans, Butcher, and two others were condemned to death by a court martial as traitors. King Charles made great efforts to save them and Lord Forth threatened to execute a similar number of parliamentary prisoners in his hands. The threat proved useless, and both Yeamans and Butcher were executed. Yeamans was hanged, drawn, and quartered opposite his house on 30 May, and his remains were buried on the same day in Christ Church, Bristol. When Fiennes was himself on trial before a court martial on charges of treason, cowardice, and the improper surrender of Bristol in July 1643, his execution of Yeamans was used against him by his enemies at Westminster such as William Prynne.<br>
<br>Administration of Yeamans's estate was granted on 7 July to his widow, Anne, said in the royalist accounts to have been a kinswoman also named Yeamans. He allegedly left eight very young children, &#145;the eldest not able to dresse itself &hellip; without helpe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two State Martyrs</span>, 31), and a ninth was born posthumously. The eldest son is said to have been Sir John Yeamans and the second Sir Robert Yeamans, who, like his brother, was created a baronet on 12 January 1665 and died in South Carolina in 1674. But both affiliations are fictitious; Sir John was born in 1611, and Sir Robert was baptized on 19 April 1617, and both were apparently sons of John Yeamans, brewer, of Redcliffe, Bristol, whose will is dated 1645. Many other members of the family are mentioned as taking a prominent part in local affairs in Bristol and Barbados. The only child of the royalist whose relationship to him is established is his daughter Anne, who married Thomas Curtis, the Quaker of Reading, and interceded for George Fox's release in 1660. Other members of the Yeamans family were Quakers, and one of them married Isabel, daughter of Margaret Fell and stepdaughter of Fox.<br>
