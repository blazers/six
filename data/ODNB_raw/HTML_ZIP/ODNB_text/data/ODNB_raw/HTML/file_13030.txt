<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry</span>, fourth Baron Herbert of Cherbury and fourth Baron Herbert of Castle Island  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1691), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was one of the sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13045/', "Richard Herbert, second Baron Herbert of Cherbury and of Castle Island (1600?&#150;1655)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13020/', "Herbert, Edward, first Baron Herbert of Cherbury")</script>], and his wife, Lady Mary Egerton (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8587/', "John Egerton, first earl of Bridgewater (1579&#150;1649)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Frances Stanley, daughter and coheir of Ferdinando, fifth earl of Derby. He was probably born about 1640, though the age of thirty-eight given on his marriage licence in December 1681 (a not necessarily reliable source) would suggest a slightly later date of birth, probably in 1643. Henry was a prominent whig and a supporter of the campaign (1679&#150;82) to exclude the Catholic duke of York from the succession, though the Herbert family had traditionally been very loyal supporters of the crown. The barony was created in 1629 to reward Henry's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13020/', "Edward Herbert (1582?&#150;1648)")</script>, traveller, scholar, and soldier, for his diplomatic services to James I; and Edward's six brothers included distinguished soldiers and politicians, as well as the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13025/', "George Herbert")</script>. Because of his advanced age Edward remained ostensibly neutral during the civil war, but his son Richard Herbert, second baron from 1648 to 1655, commanded a troop of horse in the Scottish war of 1639, raised a regiment of 12,000 foot for the king in 1642, and was heavily fined by parliament when he succeeded to the title in 1648. Richard's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13022/', "Edward Herbert (1630&#150;1678)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13020/', "Herbert, Edward, first Baron Herbert of Cherbury")</script>], succeeded as third baron in 1655, and four years later he in turn took part in Sir George Booth's unsuccessful royalist rising in Cheshire.<br>
<br>Henry Herbert also joined the rebellion and then entered the army shortly after the Restoration, serving abroad under the duke of Monmouth with the French in 1672. He succeeded to the barony in 1678, on the death of his brother Edward, and next year followed his brother as <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Montgomeryshire. This was, however, the limit of royal favour toward him, for in 1678, when he took his seat in the Lords, the Popish Plot alarm was near its height, and this, together perhaps with his acquaintance with the duke of Monmouth, drew him into opposition to the court. He voted in favour of putting the five Catholic lords allegedly implicated in the plot on trial, and voted too for the impeachment of the earl of Danby, Charles II's principal minister for many years. He was one of the half-dozen opposition peers who in November 1679 joined the earl of Shaftesbury in giving countenance to Titus Oates by attending the trial of two men accused of defaming him. Unsurprisingly the king now ordered Herbert to give up his army commission. Undeterred, Herbert was active in the petitioning campaign of 1679&#150;80 to persuade Charles to meet the parliament elected in 1679 and repeatedly prorogued, and attended the public dinners given by exclusionists in the City. When the struggle shifted in 1681 to control of the government of the City of London, Herbert was one of three leading whigs (with Shaftesbury and Francis Charlton) to be given the freedom of a major London livery company. By November 1681 Herbert had become so identified with the duke of Monmouth's exclusionist faction as to join with the duke, and his close crony Ford, Lord Grey of Wark, in issuing a public declaration that, while the three avowed their intention to exclude the duke of York, they were nevertheless completely loyal to the king and had no intention of subverting the monarchy. When a copy of their declaration was torn down in Covent Garden, Herbert at once replaced it, swearing to fight with pistol and sword any who touched it again. In March 1682 his prominence among the exclusionists was shown once again when the king banned the City of London from entertaining in any way Monmouth, Shaftesbury, Grey, or Herbert. When Monmouth went on procession in the midlands in September of that year to raise popular support, Herbert was prominent among the notables who accompanied him.<br>
<br>But while Herbert was undoubtedly close to Monmouth he also maintained good relations with Shaftesbury's wing of the whigs. Lord Howard of Escrick testified, during investigations into the Rye House plot in 1683, that in October of the previous year the earl of Shaftesbury (then desperate and trying to raise an insurrection) had told him that Herbert was one of those who would raise several thousand of the earl's &#145;brisk boys&#146; in London. This link with treason was too slight for a prosecution, and the same was true too of the testimony of another plotter, James Holloway. Captured, tried, and executed in 1684, Holloway could swear to no more than having heard Herbert's name mentioned in connection with the Rye House plot. Nevertheless, after coming to town to support Algernon Sidney at his trial for treason in 1683 Herbert, like most other whigs, lived quietly, avoiding any public notice. Under James II, however, he once again moved into parliamentary opposition to the crown. In particular, Herbert's name appeared on a shortlist of opponents of the king throughout the country, men of &#145;real position and influence, who might countenance a movement against James II&#146;  (Browning, 3.158), and he was almost certainly involved in the secret contacts with William of Orange which preceded the prince's descent on England in 1688. He took arms for William, and with Sir Edward Harley raised his part of the Welsh marches in support of the revolution. William subsequently rewarded him, Herbert becoming cofferer of the royal household in 1689, and in the same year colonel of the 23rd regiment of foot, later the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He died on 21 April 1691, and was buried in St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, on 28 April, with no heir from his marriage by licence dated 14 December 1681 to Lady Catherine Newport (<i>c</i>.1653&#150;1716), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20033/', "Francis Newport, first earl of Bradford")</script>. The barony died with him, but was recreated for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13031/', "Henry Herbert (1654&#150;1709)")</script>, another whig.<br>
