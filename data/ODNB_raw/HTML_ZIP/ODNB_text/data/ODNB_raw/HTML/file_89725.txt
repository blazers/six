<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick, Sir  (Geoffrey Richard) Desmond</span>  (1912&#150;2002), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 14 December 1912 at Fir Grove, Ash Vale, near Aldershot, Hampshire, the only child of Brigadier-General Sir (Ernest) Richard Fitzpatrick (1878&#150;1949), army officer, and his wife, Georgina Ethel, younger daughter of Thomas Robison. His father entered the Loyal North Lancashire regiment in 1899, served in the South African War and First World War, was national chairman of the British Legion (1943&#150;7), and was knighted in 1946.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick was educated at Eton College (1926&#150;30) and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1931&#150;2). In September 1932 he was commissioned second lieutenant into the Royal Dragoons, then still horsed and armed with swords (though also with rifles). Promoted lieutenant in September 1935, from 1938 he served as an intelligence officer in Palestine on counter-insurgency operations during the Palestinian Arab revolt. He was awarded an MC in 1939.<br>
<br>In December 1940 the Royals were moved to Egypt, and in early 1941 they were trained on armoured cars at Abbasia, near Cairo. They were equipped, <i>faute de mieux</i>, with South African Marmon-Herrington mark III armoured cars, thinly armoured and weakly armed. The Royals served&#151;with Fitzpatrick, promoted captain in September 1940, as adjutant&#151;in the Syrian campaign against the Vichy French in 1941. In December of that year they joined the Eighth Army in the western desert, where they functioned as a reconnaissance regiment, first with their Marmon-Herringtons, then with better Daimler and Humber armoured cars. Fitzpatrick attended the Middle East Staff College in Haifa, Palestine, and in June 1942 was appointed brigade major of 2nd armoured brigade. He had a key role in planning for the battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and it was due to his work over many weeks that the brigade's advance to assembly then battle went successfully. During the battle he was based at tactical headquarters and often under heavy fire, and thanks to his efforts much valuable intelligence was sent back, which enabled commanders to plan effectively. He was appointed MBE and promoted major in 1943. He also served in Italy in 1943. On 22 April 1944, during a brief period of home leave, he married Mary Sara Campbell (1917&#150;1996), an ATS officer and only daughter of Sir Charles Campbell of Auchinbreck, twelfth baronet, army officer; they had one daughter, Sara (<i>b</i>. 1948), and one son, Brian (<i>b</i>. 1950).<br>
<br>After serving as GSO1 at 1st United States corps and at the War Office, in October 1944 Fitzpatrick rejoined the Royals at Hilvarenbeek in the Netherlands, where he commanded A squadron and successfully countered German attacks by sorties. Promoted temporary lieutenant-colonel in January 1945, from early 1945 he commanded the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, part of the 7th armoured division (&#145;desert rats&#146;), in the Netherlands and Germany. In April 1945 the 8th hussars, in Grant tanks and scout cars, captured Tostedt, then successfully manoeuvred and fought to the River Elbe. They subsequently captured the concentration camp at Belsen and the prisoner-of-war camp at Fallingbostel, freeing thousands of prisoners of war and internees. Fitzpatrick was awarded the DSO in 1945.<br>
<br>After the war Fitzpatrick, promoted local colonel in January 1949 and brevet colonel in July 1951, held staff appointments and was an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley. Promoted substantive lieutenant-colonel in October 1952, he commanded the Royal Dragoons in the canal zone, Egypt, in 1952&#150;3, where they participated in security operations against Egyptian terrorists. Promoted colonel in December 1953, he served first at headquarters, northern army group, then (from 1957 to 1959) as chief of staff, 1st (British) corps, British army of the Rhine. Promoted major-general in 1959, he was selected by Lord Mountbatten to be the first assistant chief of defence staff (1959&#150;61) during the formation of the centralized Ministry of Defence and defence staff.<br>
<br>Contrary to the old stereotype of the dragoon officer, Fitzpatrick was clever, clear-minded, and able to reduce complex problems to their essentials, with a reportedly photographic memory and a shrewdly realistic if cynical approach to controversial issues. According to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist, he was &#145;a master tactician in the corridors of power&#146;, &#145;a superb chairman of committees&#146;, &#145;almost too clever to be a good mixer, [who] could be over sarcastic at times&#146;, but &#145;a brilliant raconteur and a charming host&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Oct 2002). He was so successful in serving Mountbatten that in 1962 he was appointed director of military operations at the War Office, when the army was overstretched by operations in Aden, Borneo, the Gulf, and the Caribbean. He played a major part in the aircraft carrier replacement and Polaris debates within the defence staff, and was involved in the British intelligence assessment of and response to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In 1964 he was appointed chief of staff of the British army of the Rhine. Knighted KCB in 1965 and promoted lieutenant-general in April that year, he was general officer commanding-in-chief, Northern Ireland, from 1965 to 1966 and vice-chief of the general staff from 1966 to 1968.<br>
<br>Promoted general in October 1968, Fitzpatrick was commander-in-chief of the British army on the Rhine and commander of the northern army group from 1968 to 1970. His appointment surprised some, as he had previously commanded neither a division nor a brigade. Nevertheless he dealt effectively with international problems. From 1964 he was the last colonel of the Royal Dragoons and contributed to their successful amalgamation in 1969 with the Royal Horse Guards to form the Blues and Royals, of which he became deputy colonel (1969&#150;74). His final army post was as deputy supreme allied commander, Europe, at NATO headquarters (SHAPE) at Mons, Belgium, from 1970 to 1973.<br>
<br>Having retired from the army in 1973, from 1974 to 1979 Fitzpatrick was lieutenant-governor of Jersey, where he indulged his passion for sailing. From 1979 to 1998 he was colonel of the Blues and Royals, and gold stick to the queen. In retirement he lived at Belmont, Otley, Suffolk, where he enjoyed fishing and shooting. His first wife died in July 1996, and on 15 May 1998 he married Lettice Mary Errington (<i>b</i>. 1915), the posthumous and only daughter of Captain Edward Stafford-King-Harman and widow first of Colonel Robert Lomer and then of Major George Errington. He died at the Suffolk Nuffield Hospital, Ipswich, on 12 October 2002, of heart failure. He was survived by his second wife and the two children of his first marriage.<br>
