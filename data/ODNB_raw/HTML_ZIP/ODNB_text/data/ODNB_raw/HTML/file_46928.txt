<span class="headword">Twysden <span class="st"> [Twisden; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Finch]</span>,  Anne</span>, Lady Twysden  (1574&#150;1638), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 28 February 1574 at Heneage House in London, the eldest daughter of Sir Maple, or Mayle, Finch (<i>d</i>. 1614) and Elizabeth Heneage (<i>d</i>. 1633). Her mother was created Viscountess Maidstone in 1623 and countess of Winchilsea in 1628. Anne was educated by her grandmother at the court of Queen Elizabeth, and was proficient in Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. She was married by Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, at Heneage House on 4 October 1591, to William Twysden (1566&#150;1629) of East Peckham, Kent. Her husband was knighted in 1603 and created a baronet in 1611. He died on 8 January 1629 and was buried at East Peckham.<br>
<br>There were five sons and two daughters of the marriage: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27929/', "Roger Twysden, second baronet (1597&#150;1672)")</script>; Elizabeth (1600&#150;1655), who married Sir Hugh Cholmley (<i>d</i>. 1657) in 1622; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27930/', "Thomas Twisden (1602&#150;1683)")</script>; Anne (1603&#150;1670), who married Sir Christopher Yelverton (<i>d</i>. 1654) in 1630; William (1605&#150;1641); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27928/', "John Twysden (1607&#150;1688)")</script>; and Francis (1610&#150;1675). The burden of Sir William's estate fell to Sir Roger on his death; Lady Anne's jointure was free. She succeeded to the two houses in East Peckham and Redcross Street, London. Her ladies-in-waiting, the diarist Isabella Saunder and Jane Thomlinson, married her sons Roger and Thomas in 1635 and 1639 respectively. Lady Anne refused to pay Charles I's ship-money tax, but was twice cajoled into paying by her eldest son, who also held objections to it.<br>
<br>Twysden composed at least one book of devotions, known as the Jennings-Bramley manuscript. This contains her own prayer compositions, scriptural passages, accounts of the devout deaths of her father, mother, and brother Sir Heneage, and a prayer composed by the latter. Sir Roger Twysden ordered a copy to be made of this manuscript, with some omissions and additions, inserting headnotes in his own hand&#151;one of these is dated 10 November 1638  (CKS, MS U 1655 F8, p. 23). The whereabouts of the former manuscript is currently unknown, although Kemble cites from it in his 1849 edition of Roger Twysden's <span class="italic">Certaine Considerations upon the Government of England</span>. Lady Twysden's letters are held in the British Library (BL, Add. MS 34173, fols. 9&#150;11), and her son Roger commented of her epistolary skills:<blockquote>She had the best way of expressing her mind in writing, w<sup>th</sup> the most facilyty I ever met with in woeman indeed it might bee incredible should I say I never saw man indite better letters then I have read of hers. (BL, Add. MS 34163, fol. 80)</blockquote>John Hiud's <span class="italic">Storie of Stories</span> (1632) was dedicated to her; Hiud (1578&#150;1651) was a German friend and servant to the family for thirty-two years.<br>
<br>Twysden fell ill at church on Sunday 23 September 1638 and died at home in Kent on 14 October following. Her sons John and Roger both provide detailed accounts of this illness, which reveal their affection for her and her piety. She was attended by most of her children, their spouses, her grandchildren, and Hiud. Sir Roger was her executor, disposing of at least &pound;168  (BL, Add. MS 34176, fols. 68&#150;73). John described her as tall and fair, while Roger surmised that she &#145;was the handsommest woeman &hellip; I ever saw&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34163, fol. 80), although she was lame from a fall as a child.<br>
