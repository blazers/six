<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Legge,  (Harry) Walter</span>  (1906&#150;1979), <span class="occ">impresario and record producer</span>, was born in Keith Grove, Ravenscourt Park, London, on 1 June 1906, the son (there was to be a younger sister) of Harry Legge (<i>b</i>. 1871) and his wife, Florence (<i>b</i>. 1871). His father was a successful tailor, and Legge was educated until the age of sixteen at Latymer High School, in Hammersmith, where he excelled at languages. As a young man, Legge collected records as a hobby, and, encouraged by his father, he also regularly attended Royal Albert Hall Sunday concerts. In these circumstances, he was soon able to teach himself to read music and German, though he never received any formal training as a musician. He acquired &#145;a fine ear, understanding of style and unusual linguistic prowess&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>, 611).<br>
<br>Legge was expected to follow his father's trade but, determined to pursue a career in classical music, he secured a job in 1927 with the HMV record shop in London's Oxford Street, part of the Gramophone Company. This lasted only a few months because he criticized the company's policy. Undeterred, he obtained further employment with the company, this time as writer of sleeve notes and articles for <span class="italic">The Voice</span>, HMV's monthly magazine for retailers, which he also edited. In this capacity he began attending recording sessions and quickly impressed HMV's musical director Fred Gaisberg with his musical knowledge and discernment. In 1931, when the classical business slumped in the great depression, Legge conceived the ingenious idea of <span class="roman">Society Editions</span> whereby a minimum number of subscribers guaranteed in advance to buy certain proposed recordings. The first project was a collection of Hugo Wolf songs and its success led to subsequent recordings of works by Bach, Beethoven, Sibelius, Delius, Mozart, and others. Legge soon started to take an active role in the recording studio, first in the production of <span class="roman">Society Editions</span> and later also for the HMV recording programme of local British artists like Myra Hess, Benno Moisiewitsch, and Walter Goehr.<br>
<br>In 1934 Legge met Sir Thomas Beecham for the first time. Beecham quickly became impressed with him and insisted that Legge supervise all his recording sessions: a demand to which Fred Gaisberg readily agreed since Beecham was one of the few artists with whom Gaisberg did not get on well. Beecham also made Legge assistant artistic director of his opera company at Covent Garden, giving Legge freedom to engage all the singers and conductors. Always critically appreciative of the talents of performers, Legge provided Beecham with a dazzling array of fine singers and conductors until the outbreak of war in 1939 put an end to opera at Covent Garden. Throughout the 1930s Legge remained active as a musical journalist. He first wrote for <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span> magazine in 1928, and in 1932 became music critic for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, covering such disparate events as the 1933 season at Bayreuth (with Adolf Hitler in the audience) and the Russian ballet's visits to London. He later wrote for the <span class="italic">Times Saturday Review</span> and for the American journal <span class="italic">High Fidelity</span>.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Legge's poor eyesight prevented him doing war service but he worked for Entertainments National Services Association (ENSA), organizing classical concerts for the armed forces and war workers. The Gramophone Company had by this time become EMI, and Legge also continued to supervise classical recordings. When hostilities ceased, Legge joined EMI's revived international artistes department as manager of the Columbia label and, together with David Bicknell, who was manager of the HMV label, immediately began to restore EMI's artiste roster, placing under exclusive contract Herbert von Karajan, Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler, Dinu Lipatti, Walter Gieseking, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, and many others. In 1941 Legge married the singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74510/', "Florence Annie (Nancy) Evans")</script>; they had one child, Helga Maria. The marriage was dissolved in 1948, and in 1953 Legge married his second wife, the soprano <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97389/', "(Olga Maria) Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (1915&#150;2006)")</script>; there were no children from this marriage.<br>
<br>Outside the record business, Walter Legge also had a galvanizing impact on the performance of music in Britain. According to <span class="italic">New Grove</span>, he &#145;always worked to raise standards of musical execution and interpretative artistry&#146;  (611). With this intent in 1945 he brought the Philharmonia String Quartet into being, and was its musical director. Legge also founded his own orchestra, the Philharmonia. Although he later remarked that he established it merely as a hobby, Legge undoubtedly felt the need for a virtuoso British symphony orchestra with which he could make recordings and thus set new, superior standards of musical performance. Beecham conducted its first public performance, a programme of Mozart, at Kingsway Hall on 27 October 1945. Karajan became its principal conductor, and guest conductors included Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler, Arturo Toscanini, Guido Cantelli, Carlo Maria Giulini, and many others. When Karajan left to succeed Furtw&auml;ngler as principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Legge appointed Otto Klemperer to take his place with the Philharmonia. Not content, in 1957 Legge created the Philharmonia chorus, in order to perform Beethoven's ninth symphony (with Klemperer as conductor). The chorus too &#145;was immediately recognised as a choir without peer&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>, 611). The Philharmonia and its chorus together were &#145;an elite whose virtuosity transformed British concert life&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The period from 1945 to 1964 was a golden age for both Legge and EMI, when Legge's talents as both record producer and impresario reached their peak. Throughout these years he continued to place under contract to EMI the greatest artistes in the world, enriching London's musical life with his Philharmonia concerts and making a vast number of outstanding recordings that set standards unlikely ever to be surpassed. However, by June 1963 Legge felt that his freedom to make recordings was severely restricted by EMI's newly formed international classical repertoire committee, whose function was to control all the company's classical recording activities. He therefore tendered his resignation on notice of one year, but in March 1964, after a disagreement with Otto Klemperer over the recording of Mozart's <span class="italic">Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</span>, Legge departed and made no further recordings for EMI except those involving his wife, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. He remained active in musical life on the continent, however, organizing concerts and producing recordings for other firms.<br>
<br>Legge died at Cap Ferrat, France, on 22 March 1979. One of his wife's recordings that he had produced closed his memorial service at St James's, Piccadilly. Although Legge was a generous and delightful host and an irresistible conversationalist, he was also ruthless in the pursuit of his own ends, though these were invariably connected with the art of music and his contribution to it. The pianist Gerald Moore once aptly described Legge as &#145;a Diaghilev where music is concerned&#146;. As a record producer and musical impresario Legge was undoubtedly without equal, and &#145;his activities have immensely benefited musical performance and appreciation all over the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>, 612).<br>
