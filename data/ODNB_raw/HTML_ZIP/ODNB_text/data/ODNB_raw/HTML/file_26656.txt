<span class="headword">Streater,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1677), <span class="occ">soldier, printer, and political pamphleteer</span>, was born in Lewes, Sussex, the son of William Streater, tailor. He had at least two brothers: Aaron, who called himself a divine and a physician; and Thomas, who in 1644 signed on with John as a stationer's apprentice. At an unknown date he married Susan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1677), and had at least one son, Joseph.<br>
<br>Streater began an apprenticeship with the London stationer Robert Hoskins in 1635. He did not have time to complete his service before the outbreak of the civil war. He joined the parliamentary army early, and fought at Newbury and Edgehill. Wounded, he returned to the capital to become a printer in his own right, gaining his freedom in June 1644. But he was soon back in the army again. He was probably at St Albans during the regicide. Subsequently he was sent to Ireland as a fortifications engineer and later quartermaster-general, where he remained for three years. It is likely that the distinctive political ideas that he published in the 1650s found their inspiration in debates during this time.<br>
<br>Streater returned to London in 1653, just before Cromwell forcibly dissolved the Rump Parliament. He thought this a disastrous act, aimed at elevating an army interest and eventually at making Cromwell himself &#145;absolute Lord of his Country&#146;. In response Streater circulated doubts among his fellow officers, proposing a six-month parliament elected by the citizenry according to their &#145;inalienable Rights&#146;  (Streater, <span class="italic">Secret Reasons</span>). From then on he became a prolific pamphleteer, returning to his trade to circulate strikingly sophisticated arguments for a republic. The first of these tracts was <span class="italic">A Glympse of that Jewel, Judicial, Just Preserving Libertie</span>. Apparently written while he was still in Ireland, it advocated a classical republicanism in which the commonwealth would be composed of heroic citizens duty-bound to understand the laws and liberties of their nation, which must be circulated in the vernacular and in print. Parliaments would be short-term affairs, with office-holders limited to terms of a year. His idea was that, with such limits in place, officials would serve the public rather than any private interest. When &#145;reasons of state&#146; were open to and judged by all, harmony would prevail. The result would be a nation whose prowess rivalled that of the ancient Roman republic.<br>
<br>During the whole of Cromwell's ascendancy Streater remained a consistent irritant. He was cashiered for <span class="italic">A Glympse</span>, and soon found himself in gaol for issuing a periodical, <span class="italic">The Grand Politick Informer</span> (no copies of this are now known). He remained interned until the collapse of Barebone's Parliament, despite an energetic and articulate campaign to be released. As soon as he was at large again he resumed his innovative use of publishing in parts as a way of avoiding suppression. His idea was to create newsbooks that, when bound together, added up to political treatises. The two principal examples were <span class="italic">Observations &hellip; upon Aristotles First Book of Political Government</span> and <span class="italic">A Politick Commentary on the Life of Caius Julius Caesar</span> (both 1654). Each provided grounds for opposing (and, Streater unsubtly hinted, assassinating) a military &#145;tyrant&#146;. Like his other works, they espoused a republican commonwealth, but in more sustained terms. <span class="italic">Observations</span> in particular added up to an impressive argument for a form of government &#145;according to nature&#146;, in which all citizens would participate. Drawing on a wide range of authorities, Streater argued that states were akin to organisms, in that they must either grow or wither, and depended on circulations in order to flourish. On this basis he built a complex republican system notable for its thoroughgoing portrait not just of political structures, but of republican virtues in action, especially those arising from public knowledge. He clearly shared convictions not only with the Milton of <span class="italic">Areopagitica</span> but with James Harrington, whose <span class="italic">Oceana</span> Streater printed clandestinely in 1656. And the same concerns were also evident in other books he printed, which shared a conviction of the importance of knowledge and its circulation akin to that of Samuel Hartlib. Streater even seems to have embarked at one point with Giles Calvert on a scheme to publish all of Jakob Boehme's works in English.<br>
<br>Streater returned to military service in 1659 with the revival of the Rump. During this climactic year he continued to publish republican arguments (especially in <span class="italic">Government Described</span>). And he made his endorsement of Harringtonian ideas plain, arguing that &#145;that a Commonwealth may be Governed as Mr. Harrington describeth, is certain; nay, England it self&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Shield</span>, 17&#150;18). But the leader he hoped would institute such a polity, Charles Fleetwood, did not think likewise, and Streater found himself watching once more in dismay as the military dismissed the Rump. But this time he resolved on defiance. He hatched a plot to seize the Tower of London and declare for parliament. The plan was betrayed, but Streater then joined the similarly disgruntled Admiral John Lawson, who sailed his fleet up the Thames while Streater handled the printing of a manifesto. With Monck approaching from the north and Lawson from the east, the army command decided to yield, and the Rump returned once more, with Streater reinstated as its official printer. Subsequently, as the revived assembly edged towards a restoration of the monarchy, Streater reluctantly acquiesced. In the spring of 1660 he and his men faced down the last hope of the military republicans, John Lambert, at the evocative field of Edgehill, thus ending the final challenge to Restoration.<br>
<br>From 1660 onwards Streater remained a printer. He built up probably the largest private printing house in the country, at one stage having five presses. Overall he seems to have accommodated himself to the new dispensation surprisingly readily. Indeed, he now presented his printing for parliament during the transition as service to the king, and was rewarded for this service, remarkably, with a blanket exemption from the new <span class="roman">Press Act</span>. Yet at the same time he was embarking on his most ambitious enterprise of all.<br>
<br>Throughout his confrontations with Cromwell, Streater had sought to publish law books. Besides being profitable, the practice coincided with his republican ideals. Now he forged an alliance with Richard Atkyns, an ex-cavalier seeking a patent on such works. For a decade and a half they mounted a campaign to secure the patent&#151;a campaign that called into doubt the entire customary basis of the London book trade, and pioneered structures of collective publishing that would survive to become basic to the eighteenth-century trade.<br>
<br>Atkyns and Streater argued that the Stationers' Company laid claim to an unjustified autonomy from royal oversight. The result was a trade dedicated to books that were trivial, poorly produced, and even seditious. In particular, the company's register system for copyrights implicitly denied the crown's ability to grant patents. So they proposed replacing this system with one dominated by gentlemen patentees, who would adhere to higher standards. In short, Streater and Atkyns sought to make the everyday world of the book trade into an extension of the Restoration state. Their case found a ready audience among a political class convinced of the role of print in fomenting the civil war, and but for the revolution of 1688 would have succeeded. Yet Streater did not live to see its outcome. Financially exhausted, he was imprisoned again, this time for debt. For once he could not extricate himself, and he died in gaol in London in 1677. He was survived by his wife and their son, Joseph, who together carried on his printing business after his death.<br>
