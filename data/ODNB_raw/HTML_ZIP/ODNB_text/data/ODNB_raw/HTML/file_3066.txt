<span class="headword">Bowle,  John</span>  (1725&#150;1788), <span class="occ">literary editor</span>, was born on 15 October 1725 at Idmiston, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, the eldest of the four children of John Bowle (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1743), gentleman, and his wife, Sarah (1700&#150;1785), daughter of the Revd Thomas Westley, rector of Brockley, Somerset. A descendant of Dr John Bowle, dean of Salisbury and bishop of Rochester, he was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took his MA in 1750 and, after ordination, became vicar of Idmiston, where his family had long been established. On 7 November 1754 he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Elliott, of Winterbourne Cherburgh, Wiltshire. She died in 1759, leaving two daughters, the elder of whom died in 1769. Bowle was elected FSA in 1776.<br>
<br>Already in his mid-twenties Bowle was acknowledged by the Revd John Douglas, in his <span class="italic">Milton Vindicated from the Charge of Plagiarism</span> (1751), as the &#145;Original Detector&#146; of the spurious evidence adduced by William Lauder. His continuing interest in English literature is seen in his publication, in 1764, of the anonymous <span class="italic">Troublesome Raigne of King John</span>, of 1591, together with various works by John Marston, as also in his contributions to Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">History of English Poetry</span> and the 1778 Johnson&#150;Steevens edition of Shakespeare. Bowle read Richard Farmer's <span class="italic">Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</span>, wrote to Edmond Malone about Edward Capell, praised the &#145;judicious editor&#146; (Thomas Tyrwhitt) of the 1775 <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>, and applied to Cervantes Warton's words on Shakespeare in his <span class="italic">Observations on Spenser</span>: &#145;If Cervantes is worth reading, he is worth explaining&#146;. This conviction led him to produce the first fully annotated edition of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>.<br>
<br>Bowle received strong encouragement for this undertaking from Thomas Percy to whose <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient Poetry</span> Bowle made contributions. Cervantes, according to Percy, was their &#145;favourite author&#146;. Percy built up a substantial &#145;Quixotic Library&#146;, consisting largely of romances of chivalry, on which he originally proposed to draw for &#145;an improved Translation [of the <span class="italic">Quixote</span>] with large Notes and Illustrations: as well containing &hellip; Extracts from the old Romances by way of a Key to [Cervantes's] satire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cervantine Correspondence</span>, 13). This aim (without the translation) became Bowle's own. He thus produced for the <span class="italic">Quixote</span>, in the same conviction as had animated Lewis Theobald in editing Shakespeare, an edition adorned with a learned apparatus of a kind hitherto generally reserved for classical texts. To this long task of the 1770s Bowle brought wide-ranging literary learning that embraced French and Italian as well as Spanish and English, his own classical education, and an untiring dedication to literary research. His library, at his death, consisted of well over 12,000 works and editions. His edition of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> was published at Salisbury in 1781 at the price of 3 guineas.<br>
<br>Bowle's 300 pages of annotations on Cervantes' text underlie all subsequent work of the kind and have brought him, with time, the highest praise in Spain. In England, in his own time, the reception of his edition brought him disappointment and pain. The auctioneers of his library offered unsold copies at half price and less. Beyond the fact that Bowle's extensive critical apparatus is entirely in Spanish, his scholarly approach to what was seen as an essentially comic masterpiece would have struck many as misconceived. This view was destructively deployed against Bowle by Giuseppe Baretti (&#145;Joseph Baretti&#146;)&#151;long resident in London and an associate of Samuel Johnson&#151;in his <span class="italic">Tolondron: Speeches to John Bowle about his Edition of Don Quixote</span> (1786), where he presented Bowle as a linguistically incompetent pedant. Bowle thus paid a high price for having written disparagingly about Baretti in his <span class="italic">Letter to the Reverend Dr Percy</span> (1777) announcing his &#145;new and classical edition&#146; of the <span class="italic">Quixote</span> to the world. Baretti subsequently made common cause with Captain John Cruickshank RN, whom Bowle had failed to thank in the preliminaries to his edition, even though Cruickshank had, in the mid-1770s, been a warm friend and supportive collaborator. Bowle responded to their criticism of himself and his edition in letters of 1784&#150;5 to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and finally in his <span class="italic">Remarks on the extraordinary conduct of the knight of the ten stars <span class="roman">[Cruickshank]</span> and his Italian squire <span class="roman">[Baretti],</span> to the editor of &#145;Don Quixote&#146;: in a letter to the Rev. J. S., D. D.</span> [probably Joseph Simpson] (1785). It was this that unleashed Baretti's <span class="italic">Tolondron</span>.<br>
<br>One who had known Bowle since 1760&#151;perhaps the Revd J. Baverstock&#151;commented, in an unsigned note, after the death of &#145;my old friend&#146; that Bowle's &#145;great error both as an editor and a Critic, was too fond an acquiescence in his first thoughts and a stubborn unyielding temper that would not allow him to submit to the slightest Retractation&#146;. On the other hand, &#145;it may be truly asserted that Baretti's <span class="roman">Tolondron</span> was the efficient cause of the Death of poor John Bowle&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. d. 244, fol. 108). His final years were further saddened by the death of his young son-in-law, who left Bowle's daughter with two small children. A member of the Essex Club established in 1784 to cheer Dr Johnson in his last days, Bowle himself died on 26 October 1788 at Idmiston, and is buried in the church there.<br>
