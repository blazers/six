<span class="headword">Cutts,  (John Henry) Graham</span>  (1884&#150;1958), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born at 47 Park Crescent, Brighton, Sussex, on 19 February 1884, the elder of two children of Henry Whitmore Cutts (1851&#150;1935), wood engraver and later dentist, and his wife, Mary Maud Colclough, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson (<i>b</i>. 1862). His grandfather was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32688/', "Revd Edward Lewes Cutts")</script>, author of books on ecclesiastical history. He was a boarder in Eastbourne, at what was advertised as an &#145;educational home for delicate boys requiring sea air&#146;, and from 1898 to 1901 at Hurstpierpoint College, Sussex. On 9 August 1909, in Hartlepool, he married Lizzie (1884&#150;1988), daughter of Thomas Hart, licensed victualler. Their only child died in infancy.<br>
<br>Trained as a marine and electrical engineer, after his marriage Cutts ran a cinema in Sevenoaks, Kent, his wife working as the cinema pianist. He went on to manage the Empire Electric Theatre, Exeter, and subsequently to run cinemas and stage screenings for Solomon Levy and George Black.<br>
<br>After moving into film-making Jack Cutts, as he was sometimes known, courted controversy with <span class="italic">Cocaine</span> (1922), made for H. B. Parkinson's Master Films: banned by the British Board of Film Censors, though screened at some cinemas outside London, it was re-issued later in 1922 as <span class="italic">While London Sleeps</span>, minus the cocaine references. Cutts and his then film-making partner Herbert Wilcox received more applause for <span class="italic">The Wonderful Story</span> (1922), which <span class="italic">Variety</span> went as far as to call &#145;probably the best ever made by a British producer in a British studio with British players&#146;  (Gore, &#145;Wonderful year&#146;). From this early stage he was remarkably successful in reaching an international audience and in bringing Hollywood stars to Britain. Mae Marsh appeared in <span class="italic">Flames of Passion</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Paddy the Next Best Thing</span> (1923), and Betty Compson in <span class="italic">Woman to Woman</span> (1923), a critical and box-office triumph, as well as in the less successful <span class="italic">The White Shadow</span> (1924). The Compson films were made for Balcon-Saville-Freedman at the Famous-Players Lasky Studios in Islington, where Michael Balcon and Cutts went on to establish Gainsborough Pictures.<br>
<br>In 1924 Cutts went to UFA's Babelsberg studios in Berlin to direct Jane Novak in Gainsborough's <span class="italic">The Blackguard</span> (1925). Alfred Hitchcock accompanied him as art director and assistant director. Hitchcock had first worked with Cutts on <span class="italic">Flames of Passion</span> but their initially amicable relationship became strained as the younger man's ambitions and ability became increasingly evident. After <span class="italic">The Prude's Fall</span> (1925) they continued to work at Gainsborough but on separate projects. However, while biographers of Hitchcock (Taylor, McGilligan) have reported that Cutts's extra-marital affairs increasingly led him to leave the film-making to his assistant, Cutts's subsequent work confirmed that he was an important film-maker in his own right. His new enthusiasm for the mobile camera enlivened <span class="italic">The Rat</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">The Triumph of the Rat</span> (1926) and helped establish Ivor Novello as a film star. Cutts had further critical and commercial successes with the Betty Balfour comedy <span class="italic">The Sea Urchin</span> (1926).<br>
<br>After returning to Berlin to film Lili Damita in <span class="italic">The Queen was in the Parlour</span> (1927) Cutts left Gainsborough for First National Pictures, though the move to Hollywood reported in the American press never happened. Instead he made <span class="italic">Chance the Idol</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Confetti</span> (1928) in Germany and the Riviera, then returned to Britain to work with Anny Ondra. An attempt to establish a new company, Allied British Film Producers Ltd, came to nothing. Cutts returned to Gainsborough to direct <span class="italic">The Return of the Rat</span> (1929), then with the coming of sound he abandoned cinema for the hotel business. After the failure of that venture he returned to the film industry, initially working with Basil Dean on, among other films, the Gracie Fields musical <span class="italic">Looking on the Bright Side</span> (1932). He went on to direct, co-direct, or work as production manager on a series of pleasing but less substantial works, from <span class="italic">Three Men in a Boat</span> (1934) to <span class="italic">Just William</span> (1940). His final films were short documentaries, made for World Wide during and at the end of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Cutts had a daughter, Patricia Cutts (1925&#150;1974), with the actress Robin Coles, formerly Gladys Rose Allen (1903/4&#150;1954), with whom he was living in Paddington Street, London, before the Second World War. Patricia Cutts went on to have a career in film and television. Latterly Cutts's home was at 50 Pepys Road, Wimbledon. He died of bronchopneumonia and lung cancer at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, on 7 September 1958, and was cremated.<br>
<br>In 1926 Iris Barry described Cutts as &#145;far and away the best known of our English directors&#146;, noting that his achievements included directing <span class="italic">Woman to Woman</span>, &#145;The first English post-war film to earn universal acclaim&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Rat</span>, &#145;the first English film to use the new photographic methods of the Germans&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 18 Aug 1926). It was not a minority view at the time. Since then Cutts has been overshadowed by Hitchcock. While clearly less successful than his one-time assistant in making the transition to sound, in the 1920s Cutts was the major figure. He was important not only as a showman, helping to raise the profile of British cinema at a particularly low point, but also for the visual style of his films. He was fond of scenes of night-life and masked balls; they resurface even in minor works such as <span class="italic">Car of Dreams</span> (1935) and were most vividly realized in the films featuring Novello as &#145;The Rat&#146;. Even the 1930s films include striking moments, from the climax of <span class="italic">The Sign of Four</span> (1932) to the 360 degree pan used in the &#145;Side-by-Side&#146; number in <span class="italic">Over She Goes</span> (1938). The disappearance of major films such as <span class="italic">Woman to Woman</span> makes it difficult to give a full assessment of his work, but the silent films that do survive confirm him as a key British film-maker.<br>
