<span class="headword">Strachan, Sir  John</span>, third baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Sir Patrick Strachan, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1765), physician at Greenwich Hospital, Kent, and his wife, the daughter of a naval captain named Gregory. His father was descended from the younger branch of the Strachan family of Thornton, Kincardineshire. Patrick's elder brother, Thomas Strachan, had been created a baronet by James II in May 1685 after a distinguished military career in the army of Emperor Leopold I. On his death the baronetcy passed to John's father and then in 1765 to John.<br>
<br>Having entered the navy over two decades earlier, Strachan was promoted lieutenant in January 1747. In 1755 he was appointed second lieutenant of the <i>St George</i>, then Lord Hawke's flagship, and a year later he went out to Gibraltar in the <i>Antelope</i> with Hawke and his fellow officers to relieve John Byng. There he was appointed to command the sloop <i>Fortune</i> and on 9 September 1756 was posted into the <i>Experiment</i> (20 guns, 160 men). In her, off Alicante on 8 July 1757, he captured the French privateer <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i> (20 guns, 460 men) with the loss of 235 French and forty-eight British sailors. During the encounter Strachan was ably assisted by William Locker who successfully entered the <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i> and secured its surrender. Strachan took the prize to Gibraltar before being moved, with Locker, to the <i>Sapphire</i> (32 guns). In her he was sent to England and in 1759 was attached to the Grand Fleet under Sir Edward Hawke and was with Commodore Robert Duff in the light squadron in Quiberon Bay.<br>
<br>Strachan remained in the <i>Sapphire</i> until 1762 and eight years later was appointed to the <i>Orford</i>, one of the squadron which went with Rear-Admiral Robert Harland to the East Indies. Ill health forced his return to England two years later and thereafter he had no active service. His marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Lovelace of Battersea, produced no children and, following his death at Bath on 26 December 1777, the baronetcy passed to his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26620/', "Richard John Strachan (1760&#150;1828)")</script>, who also achieved celebrity as a naval officer.<br>
