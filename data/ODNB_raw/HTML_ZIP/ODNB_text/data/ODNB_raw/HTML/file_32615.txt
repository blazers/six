<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craik, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1846&#150;1927), <span class="occ">civil servant and author</span>, was born in Glasgow on 18 October 1846. He was the fifth son and the ninth of the ten children of the Revd James Craik DD, minister of St George's Church, Glasgow, and at one time moderator of the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Walter Grieve, merchant, of Leith. From Glasgow high school he went, aged fourteen, to Glasgow University. In 1865 a Snell exhibition took him to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a first class in classical moderations (1867) and two years later a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and a first class in law and modern history. In 1870 he was appointed a junior examiner in the education department, and became a senior examiner in 1878. He had married, on 17 December 1873, Fanny Esther (<i>d</i>. 13 Dec 1923), daughter of Charles Duffield of Manchester; they had three sons.<br>
<br>Craik's real opportunity came in 1885 when the Scotch education department (SED), a distinct entity since the <span class="roman">Education (Scotland) Act</span> of 1872, was transferred to the political control of the new Scottish Office. Craik was chosen as secretary of the autonomous department, and continued to occupy the post with great distinction until 1904. He was created a CB (1887) and then a KCB (1897). In 1906 he became Conservative member of parliament for the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. After the four Scottish universities were combined into a single constituency in 1918, he retained his seat as one of their three representatives until his death.<br>
<br>Perhaps inspired by his uncle George Lillie Craik, Craik combined a literary with an official career. He edited a series, the <span class="roman">English Citizen</span>, for Macmillan, which included his own <span class="italic">The State in its Relation to Education</span> (1884). He was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and other periodicals; he published a <span class="italic">Life of Swift</span> (1882), <span class="italic">Selections from Swift</span> (1892), <span class="italic">English Prose Selections</span> (1893&#150;6), and <span class="italic">A Century of Scottish History</span> (1901). Later publications included <span class="italic">Impressions of India</span> (1908) and a <span class="italic">Life of Edward, Earl of Clarendon</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Craik's conspicuous success as a civil servant was not surprising, for he had a real aptitude for business and much practical sagacity, while his golden rule of &#145;look ahead&#146; made him a master in the art of correspondence. Temperamentally irascible, he did not always find it easy to appreciate an opposite point of view. In his relations with his official chiefs he was a model of discretion and loyalty, and consequently his advice came to carry more and more weight with successive governments, whatever their political complexion; he was in especially close sympathy with Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Conservative secretary for Scotland from 1895 to 1903. By the end of Craik's period of office, many Scottish politicians and educationists were complaining of the &#145;despotic&#146; methods of the SED, though his firm defence of Scottish interests was also widely appreciated.<br>
<br>As head of a small department, under a minister with many other interests, Craik was able to play a remarkably creative role. Although Treasury constraints meant that Scottish and English educational policy could not diverge very far, Craik used detailed amendments to the annual school code to bring about many significant changes. While a senior examiner, he had written a widely noted report on highland education, and as secretary he improved the financial condition of highland education and gave some recognition to the teaching of Gaelic. In elementary education, he gained much personal credit for ending the discredited system of &#145;payment by results&#146;, and for the abolition of fees, from 1890 onwards.<br>
<br>Perhaps Craik's most conspicuous achievement was the development of secondary education under the aegis of the state. The 1872 act had done little for secondary schools, but he successfully raised standards by bringing them under public inspection, by the creation of a leaving certificate linked to university entrance (1888), and by the department's control of state grants, which were extended to Scottish secondary education in 1892. Towards the end of his period of office, he also did much to encourage scientific, commercial, and technical education, though his personal preference was for the classics (he sent his own sons to Eton). He was a strong proponent of physical education and of military training for young men, and was a member of the royal commission on physical training in Scotland (1902). After leaving office, he abstained from direct criticism of his successors, but he opposed the public provision of school meals, which he thought undermined family responsibility, and remained attached to a rather narrow version of the Scottish tradition of the &#145;lad of parts&#146;, seeing educational opportunity as suited only to particularly able scholars. During the First World War, he chaired a committee on Scottish teachers' salaries which led to the introduction of a national scale in 1918.<br>
<br>As a politician, despite his well-stocked mind and his ripe experience, widened in later years by visits to South Africa (1903), Egypt and the Sudan (1907), India (1907&#150;8), and Canada (1912), Craik never overcame the disability attaching to one who begins parliamentary life at sixty with no previous practice in public speaking. Moreover, his relatively independent position as a university member induced a hardening of his innate conservatism. He sturdily refused to move with the times or to abate his dislike of new fangled devices from typewriters to cabinet secretariats. Nevertheless, he was popular in all quarters of the House of Commons, of which he ultimately became in years the oldest member. He was a man of exceptionally strong physique. His favourite recreation was hunting, and almost to the last he kept up the custom of taking morning exercise in the Row. On the outbreak of war in 1914, although then verging on seventy, he was one of the first to volunteer as a special constable.<br>
<br>Craik was sworn of the privy council in 1918 and created a baronet in January 1926. He died at his house, 5A Dean's Yard, Westminster, London, on 16 March 1927, and was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. He was succeeded as baronet by his elder son, George Lillie Craik (1874&#150;1929), chief constable, Metropolitan Police (1910&#150;14).<br>
