<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lucas, Sir  Charles</span>  (1612/13&#150;1648), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the youngest of three sons of Thomas Lucas (<i>d</i>. 1625), a barrister of St John's, Colchester, and his wife, Elizabeth Leighton (<i>d</i>. 1647), a London heiress. His eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17143/', "Sir Thomas Lucas")</script>, like Charles a professional soldier, was to serve the king in Ireland, while the royalism of the middle brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51215/', "Sir John Lucas")</script>, was to make him the prime target of Colchester rioters in the uneasy weeks which preceded the outbreak of war in 1642. Charles Lucas's youngest sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4940/', "Margaret Cavendish, duchess of Newcastle upon Tyne")</script>. The Lucas family had been prominent in Colchester and Essex affairs since the fourteenth century, and these strong local connections played a part in Lucas's later career. Sir Charles Lucas was a brave and capable cavalry commander, but he owes his measure of fame to the manner of his death. He was executed after the surrender of Colchester in 1648 and became, after Charles I, the pre-eminent royalist martyr of the civil wars. The justice of his fate was hotly debated at the time and continued to divide latterday &#145;royalists&#146; and &#145;parliamentarians&#146;.<br>
<br>Lucas was educated by a private tutor in Colchester before entering Christ's College, Cambridge, on 7 June 1628 as a fellow commoner, aged fifteen. In May 1637 he went as a cornet in his brother Sir Thomas's troop of horse to serve in the Netherlands, but though he gained useful experience his stay was brief. With the advent of the Scottish wars the Lucas brothers were high on the list of officers with experience abroad who were now &#145;elected&#146; to serve the king  (NL Wales, MS Chirk F 7042). Charles was knighted by the king at Berwick on 27 July 1639. In July 1640 he commanded a troop of horse in Sir Thomas's regiment in Yorkshire, and by September he was in command of the garrison at Richmond. By 1641 he had established himself as an able and responsible officer.<h2>
<a name="Thefirstcivilwar"></a>The first civil war</h2>Lucas was active in the king's service from the beginning of the civil wars. Between September 1642 and 1644 his actions at Powick Bridge, Edgehill, Cirencester, Nottingham, Doncaster, and elsewhere earned him a reputation for acting &#145;<i>resolutely and bravely</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 1642 [1644], 342). On Prince Rupert's recommendation he became the earl of Newcastle's lieutenant-general of horse. At Marston Moor on 2 July 1644 his brigade, on the royalist left wing, routed Sir Thomas Fairfax's horse, but in a later charge Lucas's horse was killed and he was taken prisoner. After the battle he was taken around the field to identify the eminent royalist dead so that they might be reserved for honourable burial. He is said to have wept at their numbers.<br>
<br>Lucas was finally freed by exchange in the winter of 1644&#150;1645 and soon afterwards was appointed governor of Berkeley Castle. Consequently he was not present at Naseby in June 1645. At Berkeley, Lucas's position was weakened by disaffected troops, local hostility, and unreliable officers. His subsequent surrender, after parliamentarian troops under Colonel Rainsborough stormed the outer works and undertook a heavy bombardment, did not tarnish his character as &#145;a souldier of reputation and valour&#146;  (I. Sprigge, <span class="italic">Anglia rediviva: Englands Recovery</span>, 1647, 125), for Berkeley had been &#145;well defended&#146;  (E. Walker, <span class="italic">Historical Discourses</span>, 1705, 142).<br>
<br>Lucas next joined Prince Maurice and Prince Rupert but he cannot have accompanied them into exile, for late in 1645 he was appointed lieutenant-general of horse to Sir Jacob Astley's force. On 21 March 1646 they were defeated at Stow on the Wold in the last major engagement of the first civil war and Lucas was captured. This appears to have been the occasion on which Fairfax released him on parole.<br>
<br>Lucas's property had been sequestered, but by April 1646 he was petitioning for relief. On 28 February 1648 he compounded for his delinquency in arms and took the requisite oaths, and on 16 March his fine was set at &pound;508 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. He paid half, but on 28 July the suspension of penalties against him was revoked on the ground of failure to pay the remainder. By this time, however, non-payment was the least of his sins.<h2>
<a name="ThesiegeofColchester"></a>The siege of Colchester</h2>Lucas claimed that he was forced to fly from London when the Derby House committee put a price on his head (probably in fact a reward for information against royalists illegally remaining in London). Commissioned by the prince of Wales to command in Essex, he joined the earl of Norwich and his royalist forces at Chelmsford after they crossed the Thames from Kent early in June 1648. Closely pursued by Fairfax, they marched to Colchester, reaching it on 10 June. In both towns Lucas's exploitation of his local connections was crucial in winning support. On 13 June he was one of a small band of gentlemen who, by a heroic stand at one of the town gates, thwarted Fairfax's attempt to take Colchester by storm. In the long siege of attrition that followed, Lucas, Lord Capel, and Lord Loughborough managed royalist military organization and logistics, and Lucas led several daring raids outside the walls. In negotiations between besiegers and besieged Fairfax refused to deal directly with him:<blockquote>for that he, &hellip; being his prisoner upon his Parole of Honour, and having appear'd in Arms contrary to the Rules of War, had forfeited his Honour and faith, and was not capable of command or trust in Martial affairs.</blockquote>Lucas, stung by this attack on his honour and his professionalism, sent back what even a royalist reporter significantly described as &#145;his excuse for his breech of his Parole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 284).<br>
<br>The bitter siege was marked by hunger, fire, and sickness. Lucas shared the blame for conducting a defence that had no care for civilian suffering, and he was accused of individual acts that breached the rules of war and humanity. At last on 17 August, hunger, mutiny, desertion, civilian protests, and the impossibility of relief drove the royalist leaders to seek a treaty, but their demands were unrealistic and Fairfax was in no mood to be generous. Finally on 27 August they agreed to his terms. On 28 August, at about two in the afternoon, Fairfax entered Colchester.<h2>
<a name="Execution"></a>Execution</h2>The provisions were harsh. Junior officers and lower ranks were granted quarter, but senior officers were forced to accept a surrender to mercy. Both terms had specific and well-known military meanings. Quarter preserved the prisoner's life; mercy left it at the discretion of the victorious commander. Surrender to mercy came, in Fairfax's words, &#145;without certain Assurance of Quarter; so as the Lord General may be free to put some immediately to the Sword, if he see cause&#146;  (Rushworth, 7.1247).<br>
<br>Those selected for &#145;cause&#146; were the most active royalist leaders in Colchester, with the addition of a turncoat, Colonel Farr, who eluded capture. Capel and Norwich were reserved for the judgment of parliament. The immediate victims were Lucas, Sir George Lisle, and Sir Bernard Gascoigne, speedily condemned in absentia by a council of war. They were taken to the castle, and Colonel Henry Ireton, the commissary-general, told them to prepare to die. An extraordinary debate between Lucas and Ireton followed, which ranged over questions of the authority by which they were condemned; the proper jurisdiction, whether civil or military, that covered their case; and ultimately the site of sovereignty and whether it lay in king or parliament  (Firth, <span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 2.35&#150;8). Ireton insisted that the army acted by authority of parliament; Lucas argued that their case should fall under civilian law while denying the charge of treason that this would entail, for service to the king could not be treason. At the same time, however, he appealed to military precedent. At last he desisted. He prayed again with his two friends, asked God to forgive his executioners, and to be laid down decently when he fell and buried with his ancestors. He was shot by six dragoons. Lisle kissed him, and was shot in his turn. Gascoigne, an Italian, was reprieved.<br>
<br>Lucas and Lisle became instant royalist martyrs. A flood of extravagant panegyrics followed. They were noble, heroic, and loyal, and Fairfax and his colleagues were excoriated as unsoldierly murderers and barbarians who had killed in cold blood. Fairfax felt himself on the defensive, though he had acted with perfect legality according to the laws of war that, though unwritten, governed the conduct of the armies of both sides. He was correct in arguing that &#145;by delivering upon mercy is to be understood, that some are to suffer, and the rest to go free&#146;  (Fairfax, Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax, 36, fol. 6). Furthermore military law in practice was both discretionary and exemplary; though rules were clear, the rigour with which they were enforced varied according to circumstances. At Colchester, Lucas and Lisle were the &#145;Persons pitched upon for this Example&#146;  (Rushworth, 7.1243). Yet if Fairfax was legally correct he had none the less moved into new territory. Soldiers had surrendered to mercy before in the civil war but their lives had not been forfeited. If he had not breached the laws of war he had breached conventions of practice. The executions were &#145;new, and without Example&#146;, said Clarendon  (Clarendon, 3.138).<br>
<br>The reasons offered for the new severity were varied. Royalists attributed it to Fairfax's spleen and pique and his desire for revenge for Lucas's routing of his horse at Marston Moor, and to Ireton's &#145;unmerciful and bloody Nature&#146;  (Clarendon, 3.138). Fairfax's own justification for the selection of Lucas and Lisle was patently disingenuous: they were &#145;mere soldiers of fortune&#146; and, unlike Capel and Norwich, not &#145;considerable for estates and family&#146;  (Fairfax, Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax, 36, fol. 6). Lucas's breach of parole and of the oaths at his composition not to take arms against parliament, both potentially capital charges, and accusations of himself killing in cold blood, were also adduced. In fact Lucas and Lisle, as leading officers, were selected as exemplary victims and by the rules of surrender to mercy no specific charges were needed. More broadly, the need to engage in draconian justice can be explained by the shock and fear the second civil war produced among the victors of the first, by anger at extensive breach of royalist oaths not to take arms again, and by the frustration of a long, bitter, and increasingly pointless siege.<h2>
<a name="Soldierandmartyr"></a>Soldier and martyr</h2>Lucas's character remains elusive. Clarendon found him rough, proud, uncultivated, &#145;morose&#146;, and, off the battlefield, intolerable  (Clarendon, 3.138). Yet though Lucas professed himself no &#145;rhetorician&#146; and others granted that &#145;persuasion was not his talent&#146; (Firth, <span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 2.32; <span class="italic">Beaufort MSS</span>, 21), he successfully swayed the unruly crowds at Chelmsford in 1648, and in debate with Ireton he was agile and resourceful. His lost &#145;Treatise of the arts in war&#146;, largely in cipher, suggests an intellectual as well as a practical approach to war, while a letter to Prince Rupert in 1644 reveals a talent for the conventional arts of clientage and flattery  (Warburton, 2.370&#150;71). At Colchester he took some steps to mitigate the sufferings of the inhabitants of his home town, but he allowed them no weight in military calculations. The evidence suggests a tough soldier in the mould of the professionals of his age, whose severities were thrown into harsher relief by the &#145;softness&#146; and &#145;kindness&#146; of his fellow victim Lisle. Even Clarendon granted that his ability and courage inspired men to follow him  (Clarendon, 3.138).<br>
<br>Ultimately the victims triumphed. After their execution Lucas and Lisle were privately buried in St Giles's Church with Lucas's family, but on 7 June 1661, the anniversary of their entry into the king's service, a great funeral was magnificently solemnized in Colchester after a procession through the town of soldiers, gentlemen, and civic dignitaries. The black marble stone placed over their vault recorded that they were &#145;by the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax, the General of the Parliament army, in cold blood barbarously murdered&#146;  (Morant, 1.68). Tradition held that grass would not grow on the spot where they fell.<br>
