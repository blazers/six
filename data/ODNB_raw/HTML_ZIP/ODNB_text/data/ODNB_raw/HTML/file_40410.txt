<span class="headword">Wilson,  Alexander</span>  (1776&#150;1866), <span class="occ">engineer in Russia</span>, was born on 27 February 1776 in Edinburgh, the eldest son of James Wilson, a smith. He attended grammar school and the high school in Canongate. The family emigrated to St Petersburg in 1784 when his father answered an advertisement for artisans placed by Charles Cameron, architect to Catherine II, in the Edinburgh newspapers. Wilson's education continued at a Russian public school and as a pupil of Sir Robert Graham, ceasing at the age of fourteen when he and his father were employed at the government small-arms manufactory at Sisterbeck (Wilson as a draughtsman). In 1795 both father and son became officers in the mining corps. In 1800 Wilson became interpreter and secretary to General Charles Gascoigne, former director of the Carron Works and by then head of many imperial mechanical works. In 1803 the family moved to Kolpino, James Wilson as assistant to Gascoigne; in 1806, on Gascoigne's death, Alexander Wilson succeeded him as director of the works there and at Aleksandrovsk, but without his large salary.<br>
<br>At Kolpino in the 1760s new workshops for the production of naval ironwork had been established. There Wilson rebuilt the old, and built new, sluices and water-wheels, adding steam to water power. He built steamers fitted with novel marine engines, schools, and houses. At Aleksandrovsk the works were built up to a great manufactory which turned out men who took their skills across Russia. Mills built there, such as a large flax mill and cotton mills, included the latest technology. Assisting Wilson was his brother Lewis, until his death in 1847. In addition Wilson was involved in casting guns, minting coinage, improving anchors and chain cables, building churches and hospitals, and reporting on Russian ports and engineering and mechanical works. In 1816 he was transferred from the corps of mines to the engineering and building department of the admiralty, in 1818 being promoted to major-general. In 1829 he became lieutenant-general, and engineer-general in 1853. He received four stars of different Russian orders between 1820 and 1856; in that year Alexander II ordered a gold medal to be struck to mark Wilson's fifty years as director at Kolpino and Aleksandrovsk.<br>
<br>Between 1814, when he attended Alexander I during his inspection of public establishments, and 1862, when the tsar visited the international exhibition, Wilson returned to England ten times. He took back to Russia each time the latest technological innovations and methods. During these visits he also met notable engineers of the day with whom he maintained a busy correspondence from Russia. He would also visit the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he had been a corresponding member since 1824.<br>
<br>Wilson served Russia under five tsars, all of whom he knew personally. He retired in 1860 after nearly sixty-seven years of service. He received a full pension from the crown and the use of the official residence at Aleksandrovsk which he had used since 1821 and where he died on 25 February 1866. After a service in the chapel of the British factory at St Petersburg he was buried in the family grave at Kolpino. At an early age he had begun collecting rare and useful works on architecture, engineering, and other subjects. His life was marked by honesty, integrity, public-spiritedness, and consideration for his workers. He never married.<br>
