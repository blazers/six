</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shee, Sir  Martin Archer</span>  (1769&#150;1850), <span class="occ">portrait painter and writer</span>, was born in Dublin on 20 December 1769, the younger surviving son of Martin Shee (1719/20&#150;1783), merchant, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1771), elder daughter of John Archer of Dublin. His grandfather, George Shee of Castlebar, co. Mayo, belonged to an Irish Roman Catholic family claiming kinship with the old family of O'Shea. True or not, genealogical vanity was a trait both of Martin Shee and of the future Sir Martin Archer Shee, as was a taste for turning more or less whimsical verses, which resulted, in the case of the painter, in several tedious volumes on art in rhyming couplets.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Shortly after the death of Shee's mother in 1771 his father left Dublin for Cookstown, co. Wicklow, where the boy and his brother George were looked after by their mother's widowed sister, Mrs McEvoy, who was already living with the family. Shee's father, who had gone blind some time before his marriage, provided his son with his early classical education. When Mrs McEvoy remarried (to a Mr Dillon) and moved to Dublin in 1781, Shee's father also moved back there. After his father's death in 1783 Shee was brought up in the Dillon household. He had by now received a year's classical education in Dublin with the Dominicans and had begun to study under Francis Robert West at the drawing academy of the Royal Dublin Society, where he won most of the premiums available and was awarded a silver palette. His dependent position persuaded him to leave home abruptly at fifteen and set up successfully as a portrait painter in crayon (pastel). By 1786 he was painting life-size portraits in oil and enjoying fashionable patronage. At this time he also developed a taste for the theatre, which he retained. In 1788, encouraged by Gilbert Stuart, Shee went to London, arriving on 29 June, and lodged in Southampton Street, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Shee was armed with recommendations to the likes of James Barry, Edmund Burke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West, George Romney, and John Opie, but they proved optimistic. After his death some of these introductions, his son tells us, were found undelivered among his papers, but he had made use of some, and wrote accounts of several fruitless meetings. They include a revealing description of Barry, who was discovered in considerable &#145;d&eacute;shabille&#146; amid the chaos of his dining-room, where he was working upon an etching after one of his own designs:<blockquote>The walls were perfectly concealed by &hellip; little statues, busts, and old pictures, besides casts of legs, arms, skulls, bones, hands, feet, sketches, prints, drawings, palettes, pencils, colours, canvases, frames &hellip; disposed in all the confusion and disorder of the most negligent carelessness. (Shee, 1.83&#150;4)</blockquote>Nothing came of this, nor of a meeting with Reynolds, who, Shee suspected, had no knowledge of the provider of his introduction.<br>
<br>Shee was not in difficulties, however. He expressed his determination not to return to working in crayon, and evidently gained sufficient work as a portraitist. Indeed, he moved to larger lodgings in Craven Street, the Strand, in the autumn of 1788, and in the following spring had two portraits accepted for the Royal Academy exhibition. By this date he had already become friends with the young Thomas Lawrence, and expressed his admiration for him in letters to his brother. During this period he was befriended by the actor Alexander Pope, and also gained employment creating copies in oils which the publisher Thomas Macklin needed to engrave for his <span class="italic">Gallery of the British Poets</span>. He was able to earn as much as 12 guineas for each of these copies at a time when Lawrence was charging 10 guineas for a portrait head. His own portraits were admired by the publisher John Boydell.<br>
<br>After two years Shee's career took a decisive step forward when he got to know his cousin, Sir George Shee, an Indian nabob, who showed some of his pictures to a distinguished company at dinner in February 1790. As a result Shee obtained a second and more successful introduction to Burke and thus to Reynolds. He suffered a temporary setback when four pictures were accepted for the Royal Academy exhibition in 1790 but were not hung. In November that year, however, he entered the Royal Academy Schools and, to quote his son, &#145;the course of Mr. Shee's life, during the next four or five years, offers but few events of interest to the pen of the biographer&#146;  (Shee, 1.142). Shortly after he entered the schools Shee moved into an apartment in Jermyn Street previously occupied by Lawrence, whom he was eventually to succeed as president of the Royal Academy. Shee not only tended generally to follow in Lawrence's footsteps, but has also been overshadowed by his more brilliant gifts.<h2>
<a name="Establishedcareer"></a>Established career</h2>Shee had no fewer than seven portraits at the Royal Academy in 1792, including <span class="italic">Anthony Pasquin</span> and two actors, <span class="italic">Alexander Pope</span> and <span class="italic">W. T. [&#145;Gentleman&#146;] Lewis</span>, who is seen in Vandyke costume as the marquess in Mrs Inchbald's <span class="italic">The Midnight Hour</span> (National Gallery, London). He continued to exhibit thereafter at the academy, almost exclusively showing portraits, until 1845, missing only one or two years, with only an occasional foray into fancy or history pictures. It was upon portrait painting that his rapidly growing reputation rested and his exhibits in 1795 made a particularly strong impression, including his <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> (NPG), a work which suggests the influence of Hoppner. Indeed, Hoppner expressed his admiration of Shee at this time and the likelihood of Shee's soon becoming an associate of the Royal Academy. That election took place in November 1798. In autumn 1796 Shee had moved to a large house on the south side of Golden Square at the corner of Sherard Street, and on 19 December that year he married (in Paddington church) a Roman Catholic, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1846), eldest daughter of James Power of Youghall, co. Cork. Her ancestry, like Shee's, could be made to sound suitably grand but was similarly impoverished, and so the marriage was opposed on both sides (including, briefly, by Mrs Dillon), but was evidently happy.<br>
<br>In January 1799 Shee moved again, to the house in Cavendish Square previously occupied by Romney. He initially took the nineteen-year remainder of Romney's lease, but kept the house until the end of his life. Partly because a vacancy occurred among the academicians at Barry's expulsion, Shee was swiftly elected Royal Academician in February 1800 and submitted as his diploma picture <span class="italic">Belisarius</span> (RA). He was then commissioned to paint the duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV) for the Liverpool chamber of commerce (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and from this date there was a marked increase in the number of his aristocratic and grander professional sitters.<br>
<br>In September 1802, after the peace of Amiens, Shee, like so many artists, visited Paris to see the works of art looted by Napoleon then gathered in the Louvre. Having met the father of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, he was given the opportunity of studying Napoleon close to and at length, and was impressed; the extracts of his daily journal and his letters home are of interest, not least because Shee had fluent French. In the next couple of years, however, the threat of French invasion from his admired Napoleon led Shee to the surprising attempt to raise from among the ranks of the Royal Academy a volunteer force to oppose him. There were few takers.<h2>
<a name="Authorship"></a>Authorship</h2>It was shortly after this that Shee emerged as a poet, and <span class="italic">Rhymes on Art, or, The Remonstrance of a Painter</span> was published to favourable notices in 1805. It ran to three editions, and influenced the founding of the British Institution in 1807. Shee was much involved in the British Institution and exhibited there for many years after 1807, showing exclusively fancy and history pictures, in contrast with the Royal Academy, where he tended to show portraits. Shee next published <span class="italic">Elements of Art</span>, a poem in six cantos (1809), which did not do so well. It includes the following in its introductory lines:<blockquote>
<div>Yet, may the Muse, tho' still her course she trace<br>
</div>
<div>In technic trammels, and didactic pace,<br>
</div>
<div>Collect some flow'rets as she plods along,<br>
</div>
<div>Should Taste propitious smile upon the song.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The laboured rhetorical modesty which these lines typify soon leads the author to identify his lines as &#145;rough sententious rhyme&#146;, a characterization with which it is hard to disagree. Shee went on, however, to publish <span class="italic">Commemoration of Reynolds, and other Poems</span> in 1814, followed by two novels: <span class="italic">Oldcourt</span> (1829), in which scenes of his childhood are described, and <span class="italic">Cecil Hyde</span> (1834); and a tragedy, <span class="italic">Alasco</span>, based on the unpromising topic of the partition of Poland. Charles Kemble put the play into rehearsal in 1823 but it was withdrawn when the licenser of plays, George Colman the younger, demanded alterations, although it was published in 1824.<h2>
<a name="RoyalAcademyadministration"></a>Royal Academy administration</h2>In 1805 Shee first publicly appeared in the role in which he was to be more influential than as painter, poet, novelist, or dramatist: as a tireless politician within the Royal Academy especially and in the art world at large. His first target was Joseph Farington's conduct of the hanging committee of the academy. The matter is neatly summarized by W. T. Whitley  (Whitley, 1.90&#150;91, 95&#150;7), who also provides insight into the many dissensions within the academy during this time. Shee's long-standing friendship with Hoppner had continued until this date, and was to endure, despite their professional rivalry: Shee's pursuit of Farington was founded upon the unfair exclusion from exhibition of a picture by Hoppner on the grounds of late submission to the academy. Hoppner had clearly been too ill to submit within the deadline, but at the same time Farington's committee had allowed a late picture by Northcote, although there was no such excuse in his case.<br>
<br>The long-standing result of these machinations was that Shee gained, and retained until the end of his life, the trust of his fellow academicians. Upon Lawrence's death in 1830 Shee was elected president, by eighteen votes to six for Beechey, and he was knighted in the same year. &#145;We expect much from Shee's self-devotion and chivalrous sense of honour&#146;, wrote Constable in a letter to a friend  (Whitley, 2.185). In this curious phrase Constable seems to identify that mixture of egotism and desire &#145;to serve&#146; that characterizes so many volunteer bureaucrats in British public life. It is certainly not hypocrisy; but nor is it quite selflessness. Shee was perfectly suited to running the Royal Academy. When he offered his resignation in 1845 his fellow academicians re-elected him, awarding him &pound;300 p.a. from their funds. An annual pension in the civil list of &pound;200 in recognition of Shee's &#145;merits and services&#146; was also awarded to Lady Archer Shee, and was re-granted to their three daughters on her death on 4 May 1846. She died in Brighton, where in June 1845 Shee had effectively retired for the sake of his health, living in Pavilion Colonnade.<br>
<br>After his election as president Shee defended the Royal Academy in the face of many public attacks upon it. Among them were those of Benjamin Robert Haydon, who described Shee with some exaggeration as &#145;the most impotent painter in the solar system&#146; and characterized him as &#145;the great founder of the tip-toe school&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Pope, 2.477). These culminated in a parliamentary inquiry into the arts and principles of design, and especially into academies, by which was meant above all the Royal Academy. The evidence of Haydon and Shee, together with an extract from the select committee's report, is reprinted in Shee's <span class="italic">Life</span> (vol. 2, pp. 413 ff.). When it became necessary for the Royal Academy to move out of Somerset House in 1837, Shee directed its removal to the National Gallery, where in 1845 he escorted the young Queen Victoria on a visit. In 1826 he had become an honorary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy, having lobbied for its charter and foundation a few years earlier.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Shee painted a portrait of Queen Victoria in 1842 (RA) although she preferred Hayter, and it is a rather unsatisfactory picture. Shee had performed much better in his portraits <span class="italic">William IV</span> and <span class="italic">Queen Adelaide</span> in 1834 (both Royal Collection). These full lengths of two royal sitters show that Shee could work on a grand scale in a manner suitable for state portraiture, indeed more so than any contemporary British artist other than Lawrence. He was excellent at portraying bishops, for example, a subject which has foiled countless British painters. A fine example is one of his portraits of a friend, <span class="italic">Edward Coplestone, Bishop of Llandaff</span> (priv. coll.), with its image of the west front of Llandaff Cathedral in the distance; Coplestone was Shee's professor of ancient literature at the Royal Academy. Shee could even do lawyers with grandeur and something approaching panache (see, for example, <span class="italic">Lord Campbell</span>; priv. coll.). Another example of his formal portraiture is <span class="italic">John B. Sawrey Morritt with the Toledo of Archmaster</span> (Society of Dilettanti, London). Such excellence chiefly in unsympathetic official portraiture means that it remains hard to think of Shee's professional achievement as anything other than one of passionless accomplishment. His male heads, however, are usually acutely defined, and he could sometimes strike an especially happy note. One such example is his <span class="italic">Annesley Children</span> (exh. RA, 1793), which has rare charm, and another, from his mature years, is the outstanding <span class="italic">Self-Portrait with Andrew Ellis Ellis</span> (ex Sothebys, London, 10 July 1991, lot 44), which may be considered his masterpiece.<br>
<br>Shee died in Brighton on 19 August 1850, after a prolonged illness characterized by sudden giddiness and vomiting, often brought on by reading or writing. The offer of the Royal Academy council to organize a funeral in St Paul's Cathedral was rejected by the family in favour of a private interment in Brighton cemetery (27 August 1850), after the Roman rites had been read over his coffin and those of the Anglican church in the church near the cemetery. He was survived by three sons and three daughters. Many details of his life are recorded in a remarkably pompous biography by his middle son (Martin Archer Shee, <span class="italic">The Life of Sir Martin Archer Shee</span>, 2 vols., London, 1860).<br>
