<span class="headword">Constantine,  George</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1500, <em>d.</em> in or before 1561), <span class="occ">evangelical reformer</span>, was born near the Cheshire&#150;Shropshire border and educated at a local school before going on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1517&#150;18. He became BCL in 1523&#150;4. He took minor orders in 1521, and was subsequently ordained to the priesthood. He became vicar of Sedgley, Staffordshire, about 1526. It was almost certainly at Cambridge that Constantine became an enthusiast for the Reformation. In early 1527 he was in London, where he associated with the lawyer and pamphleteer Simon Fish and recruited Robert Necton to act as an agent for Tyndale's English <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<br>
<br>In 1528 Constantine was engaged in spreading reformation ideas back in Shropshire, and later that year he was in Antwerp, having abandoned clerical dress. He was now actively being sought by the English authorities for his heterodoxy. At about this time he married, being one of the first English priests of the Reformation period to do so. As a protection against extradition he took out Antwerp citizenship, giving his profession as physician. He probably assisted William Tyndale in the publication and distribution of &#145;The examination of William Thorpe&#146; early in 1530. Later in the year he returned to England. He was arrested in 1531 and personally examined and imprisoned by Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas More in More's own house in Chelsea. Under heavy pressure Constantine co-operated with More, providing the chancellor with evidence which led to the interception of one consignment of books and the arrest of Necton for a second time. However, when the book agent Richard Bayfield, whom More had also been interrogating, was executed, Constantine decided that he would be safer out of More's reach. He escaped and fled back to rejoin his wife in Antwerp on 6 December 1531.<br>
<br>Constantine probably returned to England some time after More's resignation in 1532. He had custody of some of Thomas Poyntz's children when Poyntz was arrested in the Low Countries while attempting to secure the release of William Tyndale. Constantine was closely touched by the arrest and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn and those accused of adulterous relations with her: he admired Anne for her religious convictions and had links with some of those executed with her, having been in the service of Henry Norris and at school with William Brereton. He later expressed as much scepticism as was politic while Henry was still on the throne about the charges under which they died.<br>
<br>Constantine had some minor role as a go-between for Cromwell and the printers in the publication of the first approved English bibles in the later 1530s. He was arrested for treason in 1539 on the evidence of John Barlow after a long journey in Barlow's company full of conversational indiscretions. Constantine wrote what he claimed was a full account of these for Cromwell. It provides his views on a range of topics including the true authorship of Henry's book on the seven sacraments, Anne Boleyn and her lovers, the two current candidates for Henry's hand from Milan and Cleves, clerical marriage, the young earl of Surrey, and the proper treatment for Henry's ulcerous leg. He was imprisoned in the Tower, but released at an unknown date.<br>
<br>In the late 1540s Constantine's interests shifted to south Wales, where Bishop William Barlow of St David's made him vicar of Llawhaden and then, in 1546, appointed him his registrar. When a general visitation in six circuits was organized to implement religious reform in the following year, Constantine was a member of the circuit embracing Wales and the Welsh marches. In 1549 he became archdeacon of Carmarthen. He played a vigorous part in the enforcement of the Edwardian reformation in the diocese, for instance pulling down the high altar of St Peter's Church in Carmarthen, but became embroiled in the unedifying and highly personal conflicts which erupted between Robert Ferrar, Barlow's successor as bishop, and the cathedral chapter. Ferrar tried to deprive him of his registrarship, and eventually Constantine emerged as one of the bishop's leading opponents. His daughter had married Thomas Young, another of Ferrar's adversaries. Under Mary he adapted sufficiently at first to be able to retain his position as registrar, and in 1555 he took part in Ferrar's trial and condemnation for heresy. According to an unconfirmed report which reached John Foxe, Constantine and Young sought and obtained Ferrar's forgiveness before his execution.<br>
<br>Constantine subsequently took refuge on the continent, being enrolled as a citizen of Emden on 6 May 1556. Having returned to England after the accession of Elizabeth, he became archdeacon of Brecon in 1559, and was also appointed to that year's royal visitation, on a circuit identical to that of 1547. But he seems to have played little part in its proceedings and was dead by 3 February 1561, when a successor was instituted in his archdeaconry. His son-in-law Thomas Young became Elizabeth's first archbishop of York.<br>
