<span class="headword">Laverty <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kelly]</span>,  Maura</span>  (1907&#150;1966), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born on 15 May 1907 in Rathangan, co. Kildare, Ireland, the second eldest of thirteen children of Michael Kelly, variously a farmer, draper, and merchant, and his wife, Maryanne Tracey, a dressmaker. The family lived on an estate of 200 acres but her father's gambling ruined the family financially. On his death Kelly's mother turned to dressmaking to support herself and nine surviving children. Kelly's grandmother, who is idealized in one of her novels, also had a dressmaking business in Kildare. Kelly boarded at the Brigidine convent in Tullow, co. Carlow, with the intention of being a teacher, but she appears to have been an unwilling pupil.<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen Kelly went to Bilbao in Spain as a governess. She was treated badly and had a couple of unhappy love affairs, including a short engagement to a Hungarian called Peter, which was soon broken off. She later acted as secretary to the writer Princess Bibesco and also earned a living as a &#145;foreign correspondent&#146;, at the Banco Calamarte and as a freelance journalist in Madrid working on the daily <span class="italic">El debate</span>. In 1928 she returned to Dublin and worked as a journalist and broadcaster with the newly established national broadcasting station Radio &Eacute;ireann. In Dublin, on 3 November 1928, she married the journalist Seamus (James) Laverty, with whom she had corresponded while in Spain; they had a son and two daughters. The family's finances were precarious (her husband lost money through a business venture with the Irish sweepstake), and Maura Laverty began to write in the 1940s to support her family. The marriage ended in separation. Laverty remained with Radio &Eacute;ireann; she was in charge of women and children's programmes and hosted the electricity supply board's radio programme for eleven years, discussing books, poetry, and matters of interest to women.<br>
<br>Laverty's first book, <span class="italic">Flour Economy</span> (1941), was a popular self-help book on how to overcome wartime shortages. Her first novel <span class="italic">Never No More</span> (1942) was based on her own life growing up in Kildare and inspired by her grandmother's cooking. It was enormously successful and well received by such critics as Sean O'Faol&aacute;in. The <span class="italic">New York Times</span> noted that it was a &#145;book written as only one of Irish blood could write it, breathing a civilisation that has never succumbed to industrial strain or to overexigencies of modernity&#146;  (Binchy, xvii). Two of her novels were banned in Ireland for their sexual and political content: <span class="italic">Alone we Embark</span> (1943; published as <span class="italic">Touched by the Thorn</span> in the USA), with a central character who undertakes two unhappy marriages, which received the Irish women writers' award in 1944, and <span class="italic">No More than Human</span> (1944), a sequel to <span class="italic">Never No More</span>, the story of a Kildare girl working as a governess in Spain. In 1945 she published a children's story, <span class="italic">The Cottage in the Bog</span> (<span class="italic">Gold of Glanaree</span> in the USA), and in 1946 she brought out <span class="italic">Lift up your Gates</span> (1946), a study of slum life in Dublin which was later republished as <span class="italic">Liffey Lane</span> in 1947. In the same year she published another cookery book <span class="italic">Kind Cooking</span> illustrated by Louis le Brocquy which was the Irish non-fiction book of the month in America. In 1948 she scripted an election campaign film for Clann na Poblachta entitled <span class="italic">Our Country</span> and directed by Liam O'Leary. This highlighted the problems of Ireland in the 1940s. The narration is interspersed with footage of dole queues and dirty tenements contrasted with shop windows stocked with imported luxury goods. In 1949 she produced another children's book, <span class="italic">Green Orchard</span>.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Laverty adapted <span class="italic">Liffey Lane</span> as a series of plays including <span class="italic">Tolka Row</span>, subtitled <span class="italic">A Play of Dublin Life</span>, which was an exploration of the day-to-day life of the Nolan family set on the fringes of Dublin city. Her cookbook <span class="italic">Full and Plenty</span> (1960) made her a much loved national figure. In 1964 Laverty adapted <span class="italic">Tolka Row</span> for television with the script editor Carolyn Swift. It became a long-running, popular weekly serial for Radio Telefis &Eacute;ireann and was its first soap opera. In the 1960s Laverty also presented her own radio programme featuring &#145;agony aunt&#146; advice, listeners' letters, and recipes.<br>
<br>Laverty had suffered some ill health early in 1966 and had been hospitalized with a broken hip in March of that year. She died of a heart attack at 30 Butterfield Drive, Rathfarnham, Dublin, in July 1966, having left hospital in June. In 1995 her fairy tales were collected in <span class="italic">The Queen of Aran's Daughter</span> with illustrations by her daughter Barry Castle. She is fondly remembered for her cookbooks, and <span class="italic">Never No More</span> and <span class="italic">No More than Human</span> appeared as <span class="roman">Virago Classics</span> in the 1980s.<br>
