<span class="headword">Rayner,  Samuel</span>  (1806&#150;1879), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and lithographer</span>, was born on 15 April 1806 in Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire, the third of the five children of Samuel (<i>d</i>. 1817) and Margaret Rayner. In 1812 Rayner's parents moved to London, where they established an ironmonger's business at 7 Blandford Street, Portman Square, Marylebone. His grandfather Thomas Rayner was probably himself an artist and may have helped to teach the young Sam, as he was known, to draw. In 1821, at the age of fifteen, Rayner had a picture of Malmesbury Abbey accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy. By this time he was studying architectural draughtsmanship in the studio of John Britton, where he became a close friend of a fellow student, George Cattermole.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1823, after an elopement, Rayner married Ann Manser (1802&#150;1890), the daughter of William Manser, a London publisher, who was herself an artist and engraver in black marble. They settled at 11 Blandford Street, and in 1827 they exhibited together two drawings of Westminster Abbey at the Royal Academy (a catalogue entry&#151;&#145;S. A. Rayner&#146;&#151;has resulted in mistaken references to Samuel A. Rayner). After receiving an inheritance from his grandfather and &#145;a VERY handsome order&#146; from the sixth duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth, Rayner moved to Museum Parade, Matlock Bath, where he started business as publisher and printer. <span class="italic">Rayner's Sketches of Derbyshire Scenery Part 1</span>, lithographed by J. D. Harding, was published in 1830, and his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Haddon Hall</span> six years later, after Rayner had moved his business to 17 Friar Gate, Derby. He also opened the Cornmarket Gallery, which dealt in the family's pictures until the 1920s. Works by Rayner from this period include <span class="italic">The Derby Mechanics' Institute Exhibition, 1839</span> (Derby Museum and Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">Drawing Room in a Town House</span> (V&amp;A).<br>
<br>Rayner's family were Baptists, but in 1835 he, his wife, and children joined the Irvingite Catholic Apostolic church. The failure of an illustrated publication entitled <span class="italic">The History, Antiquities and Topography of the Town of Derby</span> (only three out of twenty-four projected parts appeared) may have induced Rayner to return to London in 1842. In 1844 he and his family moved to 15 Berners Street which was to be the family home for sixteen years.<br>
<br>In February 1845 Rayner was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, exhibiting twenty-nine drawings with the society between 1845 and 1850. Most of his drawings were architectural studies of abbeys and scenic buildings&#151;including six of Haddon Hall&#151;and were sold at between 10 and 35 guineas. His monogram was &#145;SR&#146; usually with a date. J. L. Roget commented of Rayner, perhaps unfairly, that &#145;his studies were cleverly handled and agreeable in colour, but obviously based upon the manner of George Cattermole, whose work they sometimes resemble so closely they may easily be taken for his&#146;  (Roget, 2.299). As well as making sketching trips around Britain, Rayner also travelled to France and Italy; some of his pictures were exhibited in Rome in 1839.<br>
<br>In 1851 Rayner became involved in an action in the court of queen's bench which related to a promissory note, which he had endorsed, drawn by William Manser for &pound;2000, in favour of his daughter <a href="#cosubject_69045">Ann (Nancy) Rayner [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Manser pleaded that his signature was a forgery but the jury decided against him (which presumably obliged him to honour the bill). The case brought severe strain upon the family and seems to have resulted in the temporary separation of Rayner from his wife, who had appeared as witness for her father. Rayner was also expelled by unanimous vote from the Society of Painters in Water Colours. The Rayner family were eventually reunited, and lived in Brighton from 1859 until 1864 when they returned to London.<br>
<br>By nature, Rayner was a kindly but impulsive man: on one occasion, according to family tradition, he was offered less for a picture by a client than he was asking, and responded that if that was all the picture was worth to him, he was not to have it, promptly putting his foot through it. A drawing by Nancy Rayner of about 1840 shows her father with strong features, an open, fresh face, and thick black hair which, in subsequent photographs, turned white. Rayner died in Windsor on 19 August 1879.<br>
<br>Between 1821 and 1872 Rayner had exhibited twenty drawings at the Royal Academy, four at the British Institution, and nineteen at Suffolk Street. The British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Sheffield, Derby, and Stoke-on-Trent art galleries have collections of his work. Rayner's son, Richard Manser (1834&#150;1908), and five daughters&#151;Nancy, Rhoda, known as Rose (1828&#150;1921), Frances (1834&#150;<i>c</i>.1890), <a href="#cosubject_69044">Louise [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Margaret (1837&#150;1920)&#151;all became professional artists. The eldest daughter, <a name="cosubject_69045"></a><span class="headword">Ann Ingram <span class="st"> [Nancy]</span> Rayner</span>  (1825/6&#150;1855), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born at 11 Blandford Street, London. Her drawing was influenced by Octavius Oakley who worked at the Cornmarket Gallery in Derby. In 1850 she was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours; she exhibited thirteen pictures there, and showed three times at the Royal Academy. Her drawings were mostly interiors, including two of Knole in 1852, and rustic figures, and were sold for between 15 and 20 guineas. Nancy Rayner died from consumption at 15 Berners Street, London, on 14 August 1855, at the age of twenty-nine. The society voted &pound;20 for the relief of her surviving sisters.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69044"></a><span class="headword">Louise Ingram Rayner</span>  (1832&#150;1924), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Museum Parade, Matlock Bath, on 21 June 1832. From 1852 to 1860 she exhibited oils at the Royal Academy, the first of which was entitled <span class="italic">The Interior of Haddon Chapel, Derbyshire</span>. In 1860, however, she began to exhibit with the Society of Women Artists and her subsequent work was in watercolour. Most of her drawings are street scenes which, although invariably populated, show considerable truth to nature. From 1870 she lived at Chester; she moved to Tunbridge Wells around 1910 and finally to 60 Southwater Road, St Leonards, where she died on 8 October 1924. She was a prolific artist; the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery, Bournemouth, and the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, hold examples of her work.<br>
