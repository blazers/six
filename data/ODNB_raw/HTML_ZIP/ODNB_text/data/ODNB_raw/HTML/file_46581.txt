<span class="headword">Baillieu,  Clive Latham</span>, first Baron Baillieu  (1889&#150;1967), <span class="occ">businessman and mining financier</span>, was born at Melbourne, Australia, on 24 September 1889, the eldest son of William Lawrence Baillieu (1859&#150;1936) and his wife, Bertha Martha Latham (1865&#150;1925). He was educated at Melbourne Church of England grammar school, Trinity College, Melbourne, and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a third in modern history (1913) and rowed for the Oxford crew which won the boat race in 1913. The following year he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple before returning to Australia in time to serve in the First World War with the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Flying Corps from 1915 to 1918. He retired with the rank of major, having been mentioned in dispatches and having been appointed OBE in 1918. On 24 February 1915 he married Ruby Florence Evelyn (<i>d</i>. 1962), the daughter of his father's business associate William Clark.<br>
<br>Baillieu was born into the third generation of one of the most powerful business families in Australia, part of an interlocking &eacute;lite that was in turn closely linked to imperial Britain. His father had made his name as an auctioneer during the Victorian land boom and successfully weathered the crash that followed, subsequently becoming involved in the Australian mining industry. This sector of the economy relied on the London money markets for capital, and members of the family spent much of their time shuttling between Australia and Britain.<br>
<br>Baillieu was quickly drawn into this dynamic world of imperial business. In 1923, after an interlude at the Melbourne bar, he returned to London to look after his father's mining interests and began working with William Sydney Robinson, the British representative of Broken Hill Smelters. He became closely involved with a number of lead and zinc mining and smelting enterprises, and in 1924 he joined the board of the Zinc Corporation, founded in 1911 to treat the tailing dumps from the Broken Hill mines in New South Wales. In 1936 he established (with Robinson) the New Broken Hill Consolidated mine. Although founded as a separate concern for financial reasons, the new enterprise was closely linked to the Zinc Corporation. From 1945 Baillieu was also chairman of the Central Mining and Investment Corporation. Between 1962 and 1965 he acted as deputy chairman of Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation, which had expanded to incorporate many of the mining companies with which he was involved.<br>
<br>Baillieu developed interests in a range of other businesses, including insurance and banking. He was on the board of the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank from 1929 and of the Midland Bank from 1944, and was linked to the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency from 1923 (he later became joint president of its successor, the Dalgety and New Zealand Loan). His most significant business connection was with the Dunlop Rubber Company: he sat on the board from 1929, became deputy chairman in 1945, and acted as chairman from 1949 to 1957 and president thereafter. In addition he played a role in several mining, gas, and rubber industry organizations.<br>
<br>Although he did not have a parliamentary career, Baillieu played a long-running role in the public affairs of Britain and the empire. From 1929 to 1939 he sat on the imperial communications advisory committee, and between 1930 and 1947 he acted as Australian representative on the Imperial Economic Committee. Between the wars he became a friend of Churchill, and during the Second World War, like many other prominent businessmen, he was pressed into public service to help mobilize resources. He became a member of the Export Council and in 1941 travelled to Washington as director of the British purchasing commission in the USA. He also became a member of the British supply council in North America and from 1942 to 1943 headed the British raw materials mission in Washington and acted as British representative on the combined raw materials board. After returning to Britain, from 1943 to 1945 he acted as temporary chairman of the troubled Fairey Aviation Company at the request of the British government.<br>
<br>Baillieu's role in public affairs continued after the war. From 1945 to 1953 he sat on the National Production Advisory Council on Industry and from 1946 to 1948 on the National Investment Council. He was a member of the General Advisory Council of the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1947 to 1952 and in 1948 led a British trade mission to Argentina. He also helped to establish the British Institute of Management and subsequently sat on its council for five years, acted as its first president in 1959, and was made an honorary fellow in 1960. After 1958 Baillieu was a governor of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.<br>
<br>Perhaps Baillieu's most significant public role in these years was as deputy president of the Federation of British Industries (FBI, a predecessor of the Confederation of British Industry) from 1944 to 1945 and president from 1945 to 1947. He was active in the FBI at a critical time, when British industry was wrestling not only with the need for post-war reconstruction or &#145;reconversion&#146; but also with the Labour government's plans for the nationalization of key industries. Like other members of the federation, he was convinced of the need to dismantle wartime controls and engineer a full return to free enterprise, although he was also prepared to see some degree of co-operation between government and the private sector. It was said that the Labour government's obvious solution to its problems with nationalization would have been to nationalize Baillieu, a course of action precluded only by its potential cost and the difficulty of finding enough new chairmen to replace Baillieu on so many boards.<br>
<br>Baillieu's plans for reconstruction reflected his broader view of the post-war world order. He believed that a British industrial renaissance would bring domestic prosperity and allow the Commonwealth to be strengthened as a force for international co-operation, complemented by a closer relationship with the USA. An alliance of the English-speaking peoples, an idea also promoted by Churchill and Sir Robert Menzies, would ensure the effective operation of the United Nations and provide a continuing role for Britain as a world power. This was a perspective that, in the years before the Suez crisis, was shared by many politicians and civil servants. After 1951 Baillieu also pursued his vision through the position of chairman of the English Speaking Union. He was particularly proud of his role in raising funds for the American memorial chapel in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1965 he was the principal Commonwealth organizer of the various Winston Churchill memorial trusts.<br>
<br>Baillieu owed his business success to the combination of a congenial personality and a privileged upbringing. While his affable manner helped him through a number of difficult negotiating situations, his Oxford training meant that he fitted easily into the clubbable world of City finance&#151;&#145;a most delightful personality with a fine background&#146;  (Stanley Christopherson, chairman, Midland Bank, to Keith Mason, 25 May 1944, HSBC Group Archives, London, File 9/161).<br>
<br>Baillieu had an interest in aviation and a love of flying that presumably dated from his wartime service. A habitual traveller, his frequent trips to the USA and to various parts of the British empire often meant that he was absent from board meetings. Nevertheless, such visits made Baillieu one of the leading public figures for whom the British empire and Commonwealth was more than a symbol. He in turn helped to make real the idea of the Commonwealth as a global political, economic, and cultural entity. Although partly of French extraction, Baillieu was proud of his Britishness. At the annual dinner of the Melbourne Scots in 1956 he stressed:<blockquote>the underlying moral unity of the British race. Their natural tolerance, the spirit of give and take, the willingness to live and let live: the innate respect for law, and the determination to defend its processes. It is the abiding faith in those great charters of liberty, broadbased upon the people's will, which has moulded the political and judicial systems under which we live and move. All of which explains the continuing cohesion of the British section of the Commonwealth and our real message of hope to the world. (FBI records, MSS.200/F/3/D3/4/18, proposal of &#145;The toast of Scotland&#146;, 1 Dec 1956)</blockquote>Baillieu's wider imperial identity sat easily with a sense of Australian patriotism. He was equally at home &#145;shooting on a northern moor or salmon fishing in Scottish rivers [or] walking in the hills round Mount Macedon, Victoria&#146;  (&#145;Profile&#146;, <span class="italic">Concord: The News Bulletin of the English-Speaking Union of the Commonwealth</span>, 20, 1966). One contemporary described him as &#145;a great Anglo-Australian&#146;  (<span class="italic">3rd Annual Report and Accounts, 1964, Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation Ltd</span>). He could equally be seen as an inhabitant of a British world, one that remained a significant supra-national entity well into the post-war years.<br>
<br>Baillieu was appointed CMG in 1929 and KBE in 1938. In February 1953 he was created Baron Baillieu of Sefton (Australia) and Parkwood (Surrey), the first Australian hereditary peer with successors. He had one daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom, William Latham Baillieu, succeeded to the title. Predeceased by his wife in 1962, Baillieu died in Melbourne on 18 June 1967. At his funeral Sir Robert Menzies, the former Australian prime minister, gave an oration. A memorial service was also held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 11 July 1967.<br>
