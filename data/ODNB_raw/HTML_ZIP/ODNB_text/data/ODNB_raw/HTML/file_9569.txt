<span class="headword">FitzGerald,  John David</span>, Baron FitzGerald of Kilmarnock  (1816&#150;1889), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Dublin on 1 May 1816, the second son of David FitzGerald, a Dublin tradesman, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leahy, the daughter of David Leahy, merchant, of Dublin and London, and sister of the portrait painter Edward Daniel Leahy. He was educated at a private school run by Mr Mundy at Williamstown, near Dublin, and was admitted a student of the King's Inns, Dublin, in Hilary term 1834. He was also admitted to Gray's Inn, London, on 1 May of the same year.<br>
<br>FitzGerald was called to the Irish bar in the Easter term, 1838, and shortly afterwards he joined the Munster circuit, then the leading circuit in Ireland. His progress at the bar was exceptionally fast. He specialized first in the chancery courts and later in the common-law courts, gaining a reputation as one of the best pleaders at the Irish bar. He himself attributed his rapid success largely to the fact that he worked every available moment. In 1846 FitzGerald married Rose, the youngest daughter of John Donohoe of Dublin, a distiller. Before her death in 1850 they had three sons, who later became barristers and attained the rank of KC&#151;two in Ireland and one in England.<br>
<br>In 1847, after only five years on circuit, FitzGerald was made a queen's counsel, and almost immediately he became the leader of the Munster circuit, with one of the largest practices in the Dublin courts. As early as 1847 the Irish politician Richard Lalor Sheil advised him to stand for parliament, since he seemed likely to be made a law officer; at the general election of 1852 FitzGerald was indeed returned as Liberal MP for Ennis, defeating O'Gorman Mahon by thirteen votes. In 1855 he was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland by Palmerston's first ministry, and in the same year he was elected a bencher of the King's Inns. In April 1856 he became attorney-general and was sworn of the Irish privy council.<br>
<br>FitzGerald's seemingly unclouded career received a set-back when he was accused of a serious act of misconduct by the then Irish master of the rolls, Thomas Berry Cusack-Smith. FitzGerald had presided over the winding up of the Tipperary Bank by its directors, John Sadleir and his brother James Sadleir, MP for Tipperary. While the proceedings were still pending, James Sadleir absconded; the master of the rolls charged FitzGerald with having connived at Sadleir's escape from justice &#145;for reasons which the public well knew&#146;. The charge led to heated discussion in parliament and in the press, but FitzGerald was able to clear his name by convincing the house (on 15 July 1856) that he had acted promptly to investigate the matter as soon as he heard of Sadleir's crime, and that the real fault had lain with the master of the rolls rather than with himself  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 143, 15 July 1856, 866; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 July 1856). Apart from his involvement in this <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, FitzGerald's first tenure as attorney-general was notable for his passing of a bill to establish a court of chancery appeal in Ireland (1856).<br>
<br>FitzGerald went out with the Liberal government in 1858, and on their return to power in 1859 he again became attorney-general for Ireland. In February 1860 he was appointed a justice of the court of queen's bench in Ireland; a few months later, on 3 May 1860, he married the Hon. Jane Matilda Mary Southwell, second daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Arthur Southwell, and sister of the fourth Viscount Southwell. They had ten children: four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>While attorney-general FitzGerald had been informally offered the chief secretaryship of Ireland but had expressed his desire to continue in his professional career as a lawyer. Among the cases in which he was involved as law officer were <i>R. v. Petcherine</i> (1855), the murder trial <i>R. v. Spollen</i> (1857), and <i>R. v. Conway</i>  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 and 22 Feb 1858). While he was on the Irish bench some of the most politically sensitive cases of the day were tried before him, including those of the Fenians Luby, O'Donovan Rossa, and others (1865 and 1866), Alexander Martin Sullivan and Richard Pigott for seditious libel (1868), and Charles Stewart Parnell and others (December 1880 and January 1881). His statement of the law of criminal conspiracy in the Parnell case, and regarding undue clerical influence in the Longford election case, was generally accepted and followed in subsequent cases.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1882 FitzGerald was appointed a lord of appeal with a life peerage. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 27 June 1882 and was sworn of the English privy council. He was the first Irish judge to be appointed a lord of appeal, and his appointment was received with general approval in Ireland. From then on he sat regularly in the House of Lords and on the judicial committee of the privy council. He also took part from time to time in the debates in the House of Lords, especially on subjects relating to Ireland, where his knowledge of the country and the perceived balance of his views gave weight to his opinion. He sat in the House of Lords as a Liberal: but when Gladstone supported home rule he became a Unionist. In 1883 he was elected an honorary bencher of Gray's Inn. On the death of Sir Edward Sullivan in 1885 he was offered the lord chancellorship of Ireland with a hereditary peerage, which he at first accepted, but, on further consideration, he later declined. He died on 16 October 1889 at his brother's house, 22 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin; his second wife survived him.<br>
<br>As a liberal-minded judge, FitzGerald won the reputation of being both able and fair. He was praised for his legal knowledge and for his sensitivity to legal distinctions, and was thought calm and judicial in manner. He took a strong interest in Irish educational matters and acted as a commissioner of national education (from 1863 to 1889), a visitor of the queen's colleges, and a governor of the Royal Hibernian Military School. In 1870 the University of Dublin granted him the honorary degree of LLD.<br>
