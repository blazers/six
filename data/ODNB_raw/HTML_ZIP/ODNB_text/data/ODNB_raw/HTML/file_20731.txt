<span class="headword">Oliver,  Robert Dudley</span>  (1766&#150;1850), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 31 October 1766. He entered the navy in May 1779, on the <i>Prince George</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Digby, and in her, during the early months of 1780, was shipmate of Prince William, later William IV. Remaining in the <i>Prince George</i>, Oliver went to North America in 1781, and later to the West Indies, where he was present in the operations before St Kitts in January 1782 and at the defeat of the French fleet off Dominica on 12 April. After further service in North America and in the channel, Oliver was promoted lieutenant on 21 September 1790, and in 1793 was lieutenant of the <i>Active</i> in the North Sea; in 1794 he was in the <i>Artois</i> with Captain Edmund Nagle, and after the capture of the <i>R&eacute;volutionnaire</i> on 21 October he was promoted commander, taking seniority from the date of the action. In 1795 he commanded the sloop <i>Hazard</i> on the coast of Ireland, and on 30 April 1796 was posted to the <i>Nonsuch</i>, guardship in the Humber, which he commanded until February 1798, when he was appointed to the <i>Nemesis</i> (28 guns), going out to Quebec with a large convoy. In March 1799 he joined the <i>Mermaid</i> (32 guns), in which he went to the Mediterranean, and after a successful commission brought home Lord Hutchinson from Egypt in July 1802. On the renewal of the war he was appointed in March 1803 to the <i>Melpomene</i> (38 guns), which, during the next two years, was on the coast of France.<br>
<br>Oliver married, on 19 June 1805, Mary, daughter of Sir Charles Saxton bt, for many years resident commissioner of the navy at Portsmouth. They had five sons and one daughter. The <i>Melpomene</i> joined the fleet off Trafalgar the day after the battle, and helped to tow off the prizes. Oliver was then appointed to the <i>Mars</i> (74 guns), made vacant by the death of Captain Duff; he commanded the ship on the coast of France until September 1806. In May 1810 he commissioned the <i>Valiant</i> (74 guns), in which, in 1813&#150;14, he took part in the operations on the coast of the United States. He resigned the command in July 1814, and had no further service, though promoted rear-admiral on 12 August 1819, vice-admiral on 22 July 1830, and admiral on 23 November 1841. He was an active member of the Bible Society and other religious societies in Dublin. He died at his residence, Barnhill, Dalkey, near Dublin, on 1 September 1850.<br>
