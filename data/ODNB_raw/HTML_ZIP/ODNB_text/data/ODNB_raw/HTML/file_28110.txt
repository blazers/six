<span class="headword">Straubenzee, Sir  Charles Thomas  Van</span>  (1812&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of Major Thomas Van Straubenzee (1782&#150;1843), Royal Artillery, of Spennithorne Hall, Yorkshire, and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. January 1871), youngest daughter of Major Henry Bowen of the 2nd Royal Veteran battalion, was born in Malta on 17 February 1812. His great-grandfather, Philip William Casimir Van Straubenzee (<i>d</i>. 1765), captain in the Dutch guards, came to England about 1745, was naturalized by act of parliament (28 March 1759), and married Jane, only daughter of Cholmely Turner of Kirkleatham, Yorkshire, and Jane, granddaughter and sole heir of Sir Henry Marwood, baronet, of Buskby Hall, Yorkshire. He had a younger brother, General A. Van Straubenzee, who was governor of Zutphen in 1798. His third son, Charles Spencer, married a granddaughter of Sir George Vane of Raby, and had seven sons in the British army and navy; of these, the eldest, Henry, succeeded a great-uncle as head of the family and in the property of Spennithorne, North Riding of Yorkshire; and the seventh was the father of Charles Thomas Van Straubenzee.<br>
<br>Van Straubenzee was commissioned ensign in the Ceylon Rifles on 28 August 1828, and arrived in Ceylon in June 1829. He was promoted lieutenant in the 39th foot on 22 February 1833. He joined it at Bangalore in India (Mysore), and on 17 March 1834 marched with it in the expedition under Brigadier-General Patrick Lindesay against Coorg. Mercara, the capital, was found undefended, and occupied on 6 April, the raja surrendering on 10 April, when Van Straubenzee returned with the 39th to Bangalore.<br>
<br>Van Straubenzee was promoted to a company in the 39th foot on 10 March 1837, and in November he went to England on furlough. He married, on 18 November 1841, Charlotte Louisa (<i>d</i>. 28 Nov 1900), youngest daughter of General John Luther Richardson of the East India Company, who was of the family of Lord Cramond; they had no children, and she survived her husband. In June 1842 he joined the 39th at Agra. In October 1842 he joined the army of reserve assembled at Ferozepore on the return of the troops from Afghanistan. On 27 August 1843 he was promoted regimental major, and in the autumn the 39th joined the army of exercise assembled at Agra because of the situation at Gwalior. Early in December he marched with it under Sir Hugh Gough against Sindhia. He distinguished himself at the battle of Maharajpur on 29 December, when the 39th, supported by the 56th native infantry, drove the enemy from their guns into the village, the scene of a bloody conflict; later the 39th with a charge captured the entrenched main position at Chouda, when the commanding officer of the regiment was desperately wounded, and Van Straubenzee, succeeding to the temporary command, brought it out of action after capturing two enemy standards. Van Straubenzee was mentioned in dispatches, and promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 30 April 1844.<br>
<br>On 30 August 1844 Van Straubenzee exchanged into the 13th Prince Albert's light infantry, and, returning to England with it in July 1845, was quartered at Walmer. He took part in the ceremony of presentation of new colours by Prince Albert on 13 August 1846 at Portsmouth. On 28 August he exchanged into the 3rd Buffs and accompanied them to Ireland in October. In April 1851 he embarked with the battalion for Malta, and on 11 November was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel to command it. On 20 June 1854 he was promoted brevet colonel.<br>
<br>On 12 November Van Straubenzee took the 3rd to Piraeus in connection with the war with Russia. He was made a colonel on the staff on 15 November to command the British contingent in Greece. He remained at Piraeus until 23 March 1855, when the 3rd were relieved by the 91st, and he returned with them to Malta. The British minister at Athens wrote to Lord Clarendon on 4 April 1855, praising the conduct of the Buffs at Piraeus.<br>
<br>On 14 April Van Straubenzee sailed with his battalion for the Crimea, and joined the division of Sir Colin Campbell. On 11 May he was made brigadier-general. His brigade, consisting of the Buffs, the 31st, and the 72nd, was posted to the right attack, and he commanded it in the fight at the Quarries on 7 June. On 30 July he was appointed to command the 1st brigade of the light division, and took part in both assaults on the Redan, was wounded in that of 8 September, and was mentioned in dispatches. He returned home in July 1856. He was made a CB, military division, and an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur; he also received the Mejidiye (third class), and he was promoted temporary major-general on 24 July 1856. On 29 July he was appointed to command the infantry brigade at Dublin.<br>
<br>On 20 September 1857 Van Straubenzee was gazetted to the command of a brigade in the expedition to China under Lieutenant-General Thomas Ashburnham, having already sailed in June for Hong Kong. Many of the troops intended for China were diverted to India because of the Indian mutiny, and in November Ashburnham and his staff also left Hong Kong for India, leaving Van Straubenzee in command of the British land forces in China. In December the available troops from the garrison of Hong Kong were conveyed by the fleet to the Canton River, and the island of Hainan was occupied. Van Straubenzee arrived on 22 December, and the attack on Canton by the allied British and French naval and military forces began with a bombardment on 28 December; on 5 January 1858 the city was taken. On 19 June Van Straubenzee was made a KCB (military division). He was promoted major-general on the establishment on 11 August 1859. On 15 April 1860 he was compelled by ill health to resign his command, and returned to England.<br>
<br>On 7 April 1862 Van Straubenzee took up the command of a division of the Bombay army at Ahmadabad. He was appointed colonel of the 47th foot on 31 May 1865. In this year he was temporarily in command of the Bombay army, pending the arrival of Sir Robert Cornelis Napier. He returned to England on 16 February 1866, was transferred to the colonelcy of the 39th foot on 8 December 1867, and was promoted to be lieutenant-general on 27 March 1868.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1872 Van Straubenzee was appointed governor and commander-in-chief at Malta, and was promoted general on 29 April 1875. He was governor of Malta for six years, and was made a GCB (military division) on 29 May 1875. He returned to England in June 1878, retired from the army on 1 July 1881, and settled at Bath. He died at his home, 100 Sydney Place, Bath, on 10 August 1892, and was buried in the Bathwick cemetery, Bath.<br>
