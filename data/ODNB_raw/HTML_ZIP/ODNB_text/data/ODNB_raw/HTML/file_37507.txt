<span class="headword">Hammond,  William</span>  (1727&#150;1793), <span class="occ">master mariner and merchant</span>, of Kirk Ella, East Riding of Yorkshire, was the son of Anthony Hammond (1696&#150;1759) and his wife, Mary Hayes. He was accepted as a younger brother of the Hull Trinity House in 1749, eventually becoming an elder brother and three times warden, in 1779, 1785, and 1792. As a representative of the house he regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons during the passage of the <span class="roman">Spurn Lights Act</span> of 1766. In November 1771 he sold to the Admiralty two vessels constructed at Whitby which, renamed <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i>, were fitted out for the second great voyage of discovery (1772&#150;5) of Commander (later Captain) James Cook. The two men were reputedly friends and these sturdy cat-built vessels were of a type familiar to Cook from his earliest days at sea, apprenticed to a Whitby shipmaster.<br>
<br>Hammond represented Trinity House, in close co-operation with David Hartley, MP for Hull, during the course of the <span class="roman">Hull Dock Act</span> of 1774. As chairman of the Hull Dock Company, Hammond superintended the creation of the town's first enclosed dock, which opened for shipping in 1778. While sheriff of Hull in 1785 he headed a committee set up by the Hull Trinity House to found a navigation school, an establishment which celebrated its bicentenary in 1987.<br>
<br>Hammond married Ann Bean, of York (<i>d</i>. 1785). They had twelve children. Hammond died on 26 June 1793 in Kirk Ella and was buried at Welton, near Hull. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12156/', "George Hammond")</script> was secretary to David Hartley MP and at twenty-eight became the first British resident minister in Washington, USA (1791&#150;5); he was later under-secretary for foreign affairs. William's grandson Edmund Hammond became Baron Hammond and was appointed an honorary brother of Hull Trinity House, thus renewing the family link with this institution.<br>
