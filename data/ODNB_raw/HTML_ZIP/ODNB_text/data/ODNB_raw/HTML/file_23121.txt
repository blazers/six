<span class="headword">Randolph,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> 1332), <span class="occ">soldier and guardian of Scotland</span>, was the son of Sir Thomas Randolph of Stichill, Roxburghshire, and of a daughter of Marjory, countess of Carrick, and her first husband, Adam of Kilconquhar. Thomas's mother was half-sister to Robert I, and he was &#145;our dearest nephew&#146;, but had no claim to the throne. His father (who probably died soon after 1296) and grandfather had held public office, including the chamberlainship; neither Thomas nor his father appears in the first phase of the wars of independence (1296&#150;1304).<h2>
<a name="FightingforScottishindependence"></a>Fighting for Scottish independence</h2>When Robert Bruce seized the throne on 25 March 1306, Randolph was probably with him, and he was certainly there when incompetence lost the battle of Methven on 19 June to Aymer de Valence. He was taken prisoner, and only the fact that he switched allegiance and was promised his heritage before the arrival of Edward I's orders that the prisoners were to be sent for trial and execution saved his life. He was, however, imprisoned for a year or so, first at Inverkip and then in the custody of the earl of Lincoln, but in September 1307 he is found in the party which pursued Sir James Douglas near Paisley. Late in the following year he was captured in Peeblesshire, surprised in a house by a force under Douglas, and was sent to his uncle the king, whom he is said to have reproached for fighting a war of hit and run. They quarrelled, but in March 1309 Randolph was at parliament with the style of lord of Nithsdale&#151;an obvious invitation to drive the English from their strongholds there. This he seems not to have attempted, but on 19 February 1310 he is described in the same way and as &#145;then lieutenant of the illustrious prince of Scotland from Forth to Orkney&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber sancte Marie de Lundoris</span>, no. 10), which was more than the king then controlled. Clearly he was now in the innermost counsels of Robert I.<br>
<br>Randolph's value was recognized when the king conferred upon him a huge earldom, the first new one for almost a century and one which revived a title extinct since 1130. Between 12 April and 29 October 1312 he was made earl of Moray, with territory stretching from the western sea to the Moray Firth and south to the border of Perthshire; his judicial privileges of &#145;regality&#146; were all-encompassing, and the king's tenants and vassals now owed homage to him&#151;and this before the king conferred a much smaller earldom on his own brother and heir, Edward. The limitation to heirs male was probably a bonus in the earl's eyes, not a disadvantage. In 1328 he paid &pound;275 as the tenth of rents of himself and his tenants within the regality for one term, representing annual rents totalling &pound;5500; his share of that is not discoverable.<br>
<br>Moray is not mentioned in connection with the taking of Dundee or Perth, but early in 1314, in anticipation of Edward II's promised invasion to recover Scotland, he set siege to Edinburgh Castle. Eventually, as Barbour tells it, a former member of the garrison showed a way up the castle rock; Moray and a small party climbed it at night with ladders which took them to the top of the wall, and the castle fell. Another source adds that his army had launched a major diversionary assault, which must be correct, for the few on the wall cannot have overcome the garrison by themselves. The date was 14 March 1314; when Edward II came there in June 1314 and in August 1322, the castle on Edinburgh Rock was a heap of rubble.<br>
<br>In the preparations for Edward's attempt to relieve Stirling Castle, Robert I made Moray and Edward Bruce commanders of the two forward divisions, or &#145;battles&#146;, of his army, while he commanded the rear. On 23 June 1314 a group broke away from the English army as it went through the Torwood, and made for the castle. The king is said (by Barbour) to have reproached Moray that a rose had fallen from his chaplet, but the remark may have been borrowed from the chivalrous court of Edward III in France (1340s); it is not in doubt that Moray with a force of infantry stopped the English knights, killed many, and put great heart into the main Scottish army. On the following day, according to Barbour, after the English van rode at Edward Bruce's division, Moray and his division attacked the main English force. The progress of the battle is obscure, but the English defeat was complete save for the escape of Edward II.<h2>
<a name="WarinIrelandandEngland"></a>War in Ireland and England</h2>The disaster did not put the English in a peace-making frame of mind, and the Scots had to turn the screw by direct attacks on England and by seeking to drive them from Ireland. Moray crossed to Ulster with Edward Bruce in May 1315, and campaigned with him to Louth in the summer. He returned for reinforcements to Scotland, rejoining Edward at Dundalk to ravage as far south as Castledermot in the winter of 1315&#150;16, then went back to Scotland, where he appears on 16 July 1316 for the first time as lord of Man. He was then at the unsuccessful siege of Berwick, but at an assembly at Cupar, Fife, on 30 September 1316 the king confirmed Moray and Man to him in a wholly exceptional act carrying not only the great seal, but also the seals of Edward (Bruce), king of Ireland, and of the prelates and magnates. What lies behind this is uncertain, but most probably it records Edward's reluctant agreement to Moray's title to Man, which the Scots had regained and lost once more; it was recovered by Moray, apparently late in 1317.<br>
<br>In the first half of 1317 Moray was with King Robert in Ireland, ravaging as far as Tipperary, before returning in May. In the following years he was active in northern England, offering the alternative of paying blackmail or suffering destruction. He secured the surrender of a number of Northumberland castles in 1318, and in 1319 commanded the force which defeated the men of Yorkshire at Myton and drew Edward II from the siege of Berwick. After the truce of 1320&#150;21 he commanded under the king in the invasion of October 1322, when Edward was humiliated at Byland; Moray led the uphill assault which drove the English to flight. The military abilities he showed in these years have to be read between the lines of Barbour's poem, which is much concerned to advance the repute of Douglas, often at the expense of Moray.<br>
<br>When Edward Bruce went to Ireland, it was as King Robert's designated heir presumptive; none the less if Robert had an under-age son, Moray, not Edward, was to be guardian. In December 1318, when Edward had been killed, the succession of a child became more likely and Moray was confirmed as designated guardian (failing him, now, Douglas), and was given the valuable lordship of Annandale, formerly of the Bruce family. His position as second in the kingdom after an ailing king was as apparent as his unswerving loyalty, and in marked contrast to the royal home life south of the border. It was he who swore on the king's behalf to the truce of 1319 and to the extraordinary agreement with Andrew Harclay on 3 January 1323; he had negotiated with the earl of Lancaster in January 1322 as &#145;lieutenant&#146; on behalf of a king in declining health who would not allow him to act as ambassador in England in 1323 without receiving very important English hostages in return. Once they had been received, he made the thirteen-year truce of Bishopthorpe, which effectively recognized the stalemate of the war, on 30 May 1323.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticservices"></a>Diplomatic services</h2>Moray now entered the international stage, for that truce permitted the Scots to seek the lifting of ecclesiastical sanctions imposed on them as warmongers, and he wrote to John XXII (doubtless the wording came from the royal chancery) seeking his recognition of Robert as king. By mid-January 1324 he was at Avignon, where he so far prevailed that John XXII agreed to write to Robert as king, if only to tell him that this did not mean that he was recognized as king; the pope also fell silent about the censures of 1317&#150;20. On his return in 1324 Moray was supposed to go to York for peace negotiations, but there was no serious English will for them; he had to make do with a renewal of royal charters of his three lordships. None the less his time abroad was clearly not wasted, for he was given letters of credence to Charles IV of France in April 1325 and was at the French court with an embassy by June. From there he went to the papal court, where he is recorded on 1 October, and where he may have stayed for some months. In February 1326 the pope wrote to him urging him to return from France to Scotland, but the Anglo-French war of St Sardos in 1324&#150;5 had produced a much more favourable climate at the French court. There in April 1326 he made the treaty of Corbeil, a Franco-Scottish alliance which, after twenty-three years of French indifference or hostility, became the cornerstone of Scottish foreign policy for the remainder of the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>Moray returned with this remarkable achievement to obtain his king's confirmation in the parliament of July 1326. Six months later the Scots broke the truce, and in the summer of 1327 launched a highly successful attack on northern England. Moray was in command, but Douglas brought tactical skill and is depicted by Barbour as saving Moray from the folly of fighting their way out of a tight corner; that is as may be. What is clear is that first they drew Edward III himself into responding, and then humiliated the king and his divided Anglo-Hainaultese force, before escaping unnoticed at night from Stanhope Park. They were home by 9 August 1327. A month later King Robert was in Northumberland, besieging castles and distributing lands there to his followers; the bankrupt English government had no option but peace, which was concluded at Edinburgh in March 1328. In July Moray took the child David Bruce to Berwick for his marriage to Joan of the Tower, and negotiated again with Queen Isabella, agreeing that four English magnates, Thomas Wake, Henry de Beaumont, Henry Percy, and William Zouche, should have restitution of the lands they claimed in Scotland. This departure from the determined policy of Robert I is difficult to explain, and the failure to carry it out certainly gave Edward III his excuse to interfere again in Scotland.<h2>
<a name="GuardianofScotland"></a>Guardian of Scotland</h2>The death of King Robert on 7 June 1329 made Moray guardian or regent for David II, an office he fulfilled with determination and distinction for a miserable 100 merks per annum. The government lost the annual tenth of rents granted to Robert for life, but persisted with the three-year tenth granted in 1328 to pay off the English for the peace. The last instalment of the &pound;20,000 was paid in November 1331, the penalty documents destroyed, and the new king, knighted by Moray, crowned and anointed, received the homage of his magnates; the peace and above all the recognition of independence now seemed secure. Credit for the extraordinary achievements of the years 1327&#150;31 belongs to Robert I and Moray, though the greater share must go to the earl. The guardianship was not untroubled, however, for Douglas had been killed in Spain, and the disinherited were nagging for their rights. The chronicler Bower depicts Moray active throughout the kingdom as justiciar, enforcing a stern justice, and then falling ill, poisoned by a friar, but struggling to appear fit as, swollen and flushed, with his army he received an English herald, whom he convinced that the Scots could still win a war, so that hostile plans were dropped. Moray died at Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, on 20 July 1332; presumably he had been nauseous for some time, suggesting liver cancer rather than food poisoning. On 6 August the disinherited invaded.<br>
<br>According to Barbour, Moray was of middling height and build, with a broad pleasant face; courteous and debonair, he loved loyalty, generosity, and honour. The few royal accounts show him close to King Robert in his final illness, and he was buried near him in Dunfermline Abbey. He married Isabel, daughter of Sir John Stewart of Bunkle, and they had two sons and two daughters. The elder son, <a name="cosubject_54305"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Randolph</span>, second earl of Moray  (<em>d.</em> 1332)<span class="occ"></span>, was killed within weeks of succeeding to his father's title, fighting the disinherited at Dupplin Moor, Perthshire, on 12 August 1332, and was succeeded by the third earl, his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23119/', "John Randolph")</script>, who was killed at Nevilles Cross. Both brothers were childless, and the earldom passed, despite the entail of 1312, to the earl of Dunbar, husband of their elder sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8200/', "Agnes Dunbar")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8206/', "Dunbar, Patrick (1285&#150;1369)")</script>]. The extinction of the Randolph name and male lineage explains, at least in part, Barbour's subordination, in repute, of the first earl to Sir James Douglas.<br>
