<span class="headword">Colt <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Poultrain or Poutrain]</span>,  Maximilian</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1595&#150;1645), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Arras. After a stay in Utrecht he went to England, probably as a protestant refugee. He was in London by 1595 and Anglicized his surname (his former name, Poultrain or Poutrain, is taken from English sources and is possibly corrupt). In January 1607 he became an English citizen.<br>
<br>On 31 January 1604 Colt had married Susanna Gheeraerts (<i>d</i>. 1645), a niece of the king's deputy serjeant painter John De Critz the elder. The royal connection was to be of enormous value and must have helped him secure the most prestigious commission available to any sculptor in England at the time, that of the tomb of Elizabeth I in Westminster Abbey (1605&#150;6). Traditional in form but up-to-date in style, it was very competently executed and seems to have given satisfaction. In the year it was completed Colt was asked to make another royal memorial, this time commemorating Princess Sophia, the infant daughter of James I, who had died the previous June. This is a work of remarkable, indeed unprecedented naturalism and shows the child asleep in a cradle, lying at Queen Elizabeth's feet. It was complete by December 1607. In the same month Sophia's elder sister Mary died and Colt found himself making a third royal memorial (1608). The two girls are represented side by side, but Mary, who was only two years old at the time of her death, is portrayed as a miniature adult, dressed in her best clothes and reclining on a tomb chest in a stiff, awkward posture which was then becoming fashionable.<br>
<br>In July 1608 Colt was appointed to the specially created post of master sculptor or master carver to the king. In this capacity he was called upon to do a wide range of work; much of it was quite humble and routine, and it included carving in wood as well as marble and stone. Most notably, he supplied and installed three chimney-pieces at Denmark House (old Somerset House) in 1610&#150;11 and carved a &#145;greate newe wyndowe&#146; (probably a pierced wooden screen) for the chapel at Greenwich Palace in 1623&#150;4. He also did decorative carving on the royal barges and supplied effigies for the funerals of Anne of Denmark (1619) and James I (1625). The effigies survive in part only at Westminster Abbey and the rest of the work has entirely perished.<br>
<br>Colt's greatest patron was not James himself but his lord treasurer, Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury. A man of culture and artistic discernment, Cecil advanced Colt's career in the royal service and employed him privately. For the earl's country seat, Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, Colt executed at least three chimney-pieces, including, almost certainly, that in the King James drawing-room, which has a life-size statue of the king on the upper tier. This work was begun <i>c</i>.1609 and in the same year Colt submitted a model of Salisbury's own tomb which was eventually erected after his death in Hatfield parish church (<i>c</i>.1614&#150;<i>c</i>.1618). The tomb must rank as Colt's masterpiece, though it probably owes much to Salisbury's own ideas and initiative. The earl is shown recumbent on a slab of black marble supported by kneeling figures of the cardinal virtues while below the slab is a symbolic skeleton on a rolled straw mat. The work was revolutionary for the England of its day in that it was not painted in bright colours or embellished with features borrowed from architecture; instead, it depends for its effect on the character and disposition of the figures and on a simple contrast of black and white marbles. The white marble was Carrara, supplied at great expense from Italy by Salisbury himself.<br>
<br>After the funeral of James I in 1625, Colt gained no further royal patronage. His career, which seems to have been already in decline by this time, apparently petered out by the end of the 1630s. Either he or his son of the same name (<i>bap</i>. 1609) was released from the Fleet debtors' gaol by 1641. He appears to have been still alive in 1644&#150;5 and no replacement had been found for him in the royal service before the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, strongly suggesting that he had held office at least until the outbreak of the English civil war in 1642.<br>
<br>Colt's brother <a name="cosubject_73264"></a><span class="headword">John Colt <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Poutrain]</span> the elder</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1637)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Arras and arrived in England before him but did not achieve the same success and seems to have been dogged by poverty for much of his career. His only certain work is the effigy of Elizabeth I which he made for her funeral in Westminster Abbey. By 1602 he had married Ieudique (Judith) Breule; their son <a name="cosubject_5997"></a><span class="headword">John Colt the younger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1606, <em>d.</em> 1665)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized on 13 April 1606 at the French church, Threadneedle Street, in the City of London. John Colt the elder was buried on 9 August 1637 at St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield, in the City of London. The younger John was an assistant to Hubert Le Sueur, court sculptor to Charles I. One of the two Johns, probably the younger, made sculpture for the chapel of the London Charterhouse in the late 1630s. It consisted mainly of a commandment table flanked by statues of Moses and Aaron which probably served as an altar reredos; a wall tablet with figures of the twelve apostles, also supplied by the same sculptor, may have formed part of the same structure. The tablet is lost but parts of the commandment table have been rediscovered. The younger John married Elizabeth Woodham at St Bartholomew's Church on 21 May 1635 and died of plague thirty years later, being buried at St Bartholomew's on 20 August 1665.<br>
