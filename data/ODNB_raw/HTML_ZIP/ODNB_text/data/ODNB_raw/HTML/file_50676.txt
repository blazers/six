<span class="headword">La Chapelle,  Vincent</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1733&#150;1736), <span class="occ">cook and writer on cookery</span>, was one of the most influential cooks in the early eighteenth century, but almost nothing is known about his personal life. When he published <span class="italic">The Modern Cook</span> at his own expense in 1733, he was described as having lately been the principal cook of the fourth earl of Chesterfield. A year later an advertisement for his book described him as cook to the count of Montijo; in 1736, the title page announced that he was now chief cook to his highness the prince of Orange. Before entering the service of Lord Chesterfield, La Chapelle claimed, he travelled widely and visited, among other places, India. His book reflects a curiosity about cookery throughout the world and includes recipes for such dishes as &#145;Calf's head Hanover style&#146;, &#145;Tripe the Polish way&#146;, &#145;Hare the Swiss way&#146;, and &#145;Chicken the Jamaican way&#146;. Not only are there numerous recipes &#145;&agrave; l'Anglaise&#146;, but the work manifestly indicates La Chapelle's respect for English food and cooking. His culinary philosophy is revealed in his very first pages, where he wrote that: &#145;A cook of genius will invent new delicasies to please the palates of those for whom he is to labour, his art, like all others, being subject to change&#146;  (Hyman and Hyman, &#145;La Chapelle and Massialot&#146;, 45).<br>
<br>When his book was published in French, again at the author's expense, in 1735 under the title <span class="italic">Le cuisinier moderne</span>, La Chapelle warned his French readers that he was not writing solely for them. Nevertheless, his cookery fitted into the French mould&#151;partly because many of his recipes were reproduced (without proper acknowledgement) from Fran&ccedil;ois Massialot's <span class="italic">Cuisinier royal et bourgeois</span> (1691)&#151;one of the most popular French cookery books of the time. Despite its heavy borrowings from this older treatise, La Chapelle's book was original in many respects. It is a monumental work (from three large volumes in 1733, it grew to five in the second French edition of 1742), illustrated with sixteen engravings of imposing dimensions. Virtually every branch of cookery is treated, and it was the first eighteenth-century French cookery text to announce a rupture with the past and vaunt the merits of <i>cuisine moderne</i>, claiming it to be simpler, healthier, and more elegantly served than former styles of cooking.<br>
<br>La Chapelle not only introduced the French to such English dishes as &#145;Rosbif&#146;, &#145;Beef steks&#146;, and &#145;Potin&#146; (pudding), but also incited French chefs to be more adventurous and to draw upon other culinary traditions for inspiration. <span class="italic">Le cuisinier moderne</span> is no doubt one of the most influential of all the cookbooks published in the eighteenth century. Antonin Car&ecirc;me (1833) judged it &#145;digne de mon attention&#146; (&#145;worthy of attention&#146;; Hyman and Hyman, &#145;Vincent La Chapelle&#146;, 35) and a century later Auguste Escoffier included a &#145;Sauce Vincent&#146; in his classic, <span class="italic">Le guide culinaire</span> (1921 edn), adding that &#145;this sauce was created by Vincent La Chapelle, one of the great master chefs of the 18th century&#146;  (p. 36).<br>
