<span class="headword">Anstey,  Richard  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1137&#150;1194/5), <span class="occ">litigant</span>, was the son of Hubert The squire (<i>armiger</i>), the chamberlain of Matilda, countess of Boulogne (King Stephen's queen), and of his wife, Agnes, daughter of Richard de Sackville. Hubert held lands of the honour of Boulogne at Bendish (in Radwinter) and at Tey in Essex, and at Berkesden (in Aspenden) in Hertfordshire. He acquired the Essex manors of Ridgwell and Little Yeldham, which belonged to the same honour, from William son of Ingram de Mustroil, and may also have acquired the manors of Great Anstey in Hertfordshire and Nutfield in Surrey, which were later in his son's possession, and which also belonged to the honour of Boulogne. Richard and his younger brother John are both mentioned as consenting with their mother to a grant made by their father, Hubert, of part of the land at Braughing in Hertfordshire that had been given to Hubert in exchange for land at Bendish. That grant cannot be later than 1147, and establishes that by then both were alive. Richard was probably of age when he began the celebrated <i>Anstey case</i> late in 1158. That suggests that he was probably then aged over twenty-one. If so, he must have been born no later than 1137, and possibly a little earlier than that. But he is not mentioned in a grant made by Hubert as the queen's chamberlain (and thus after 1135) that is witnessed by Agnes, but by none of their children. This indicates that he may not yet have been born when it was made. Richard also had a sister Maud, who is mentioned as consenting with her brothers and Agnes to a grant of tithes and other property to Aldgate Priory by Hubert.<br>
<br>Richard of Anstey has become well known to historians from being the claimant in the <i>Anstey case</i>, perhaps the best documented piece of English litigation for any period before 1200. Richard was claiming the whole of the inheritance of his maternal uncle, William de Sackville, against William's daughter Mabel, who by the time the case was brought had become the wife of Richard de Francheville. William had died about 1149, and Richard was later to allege that before his death William had &#145;instituted&#146; Richard as his heir. This may mean that he had formally acknowledged him as his lawful heir. William evidently possessed lands in France as well as in England, and initially Mabel succeeded in asserting her right to her father's French lands in the court of Thibaud, count of Blois (<i>d</i>. 1152). She may then also have taken possession of his lands in England. These included seven Essex demesne manors, the Hertfordshire manor of Little Anstey, the Suffolk manor of Wenham, and the overlordship over ten and a half knights' fees, mainly in Essex but also in Hertfordshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. Richard initiated his litigation against his cousin claiming the Sackville inheritance in England in late November 1158. The basis of his claim was that Mabel was illegitimate since she was the daughter of a marriage that had been annulled by the papal legate Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester, on the grounds of William's pre-contract with Albreda de Tregoze (<i>c</i>.1139), and that in the absence of legitimate issue he was William's closest heir. The case started in the court of Richard de Lucy (of whom part of the land was held, but probably here acting as royal justiciar), and when the question of Mabel's legitimacy was raised it was removed into the court of the archbishop of Canterbury. From there in 1161 it went on appeal to Pope Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1159&#150;81), who appointed judges delegate to determine the matter in England. However, an appeal was made from them back to the pope, and the question of Mabel's legitimacy was eventually determined in Richard's favour in Rome. With this question settled, the suit resumed in the secular courts, and judgment was eventually given at Westminster in the presence of Henry II in the summer of 1163, awarding the inheritance to Richard.<br>
<br>Our knowledge of what happened in the case and just how much Richard had paid out over the course of the five years to secure his uncle's legacy comes from a detailed account (now TNA: PRO, E 101/505/1) drawn up some four years later. It records a total outlay of &pound;344 7<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., a substantial figure inflated both by the costs of numerous journeys, abroad as well as in England&#151;Anstey himself went to south-west France in pursuit of King Henry, while his agents travelled to Normandy, Tours, and Rome&#151;and by the interest, amounting to over &pound;53, that he was obliged to pay on necessary loans. Modern understanding of the case is also aided by a helpful summary of what had been alleged by the parties in the litigation in the archbishop's court in a letter drawn up by John of Salisbury in the name of Archbishop Theobald for transmission to the pope. It survives in the collection of John's letters. But our knowledge of what was at stake in the litigation comes only from a case brought almost a century later (in 1244&#150;6), which cites a final concord made during the reign of Richard I between Richard's son Hubert and Ralph Gernun and which settled Ralph's claim to a rightful share in the Sackville inheritance. This reveals what nothing in the earlier documentation even hints at: that Richard's mother, Agnes, was not the only daughter of Richard de Sackville, but the elder of two daughters. Ralph's mother, Hodierna, was the younger daughter. It was only in Richard's reign, and after the death of Richard of Anstey, that her descendant succeeded in asserting a claim to a half share in that inheritance.<br>
<br>Richard of Anstey probably lived in the castle at Great Anstey, which is thought to have been erected before his time and continued in the thirteenth century to form the centre of the family's landholdings. He was still alive in the autumn of 1194, but had been dead for at least half a year by the following autumn. His eldest son, William, had died before him, childless. He was therefore succeeded by his second son, Hubert, who himself lived only to 1210. Hubert's long-lived granddaughter Denise was the wife of Warin de Munchensi. Richard also had one unnamed daughter, whom Henry II gave in marriage to Adam of Sanford in 1174&#150;5.<br>
