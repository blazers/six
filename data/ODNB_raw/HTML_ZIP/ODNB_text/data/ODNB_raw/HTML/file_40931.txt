<span class="headword">Browne,  Thomas Alexander</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Rolf Boldrewood]</span>  (1826&#150;1915), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in London on 6 August 1826, the eldest child of Sylvester John Brown, merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Elizabeth Angell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alexander. He lived in Australia from the age of five, when his father settled in Sydney after delivering a cargo of convicts to Hobart Town in his own barque, the <i>Proteus</i>. The family moved to the new settlement at Port Phillip (Melbourne) in 1839, but Thomas stayed in Sydney as a boarder at Sydney College until 1841. After joining his family in Melbourne he was tutored by the Revd David Boyd, his former classics master at Sydney College. In 1844 he took up a cattle run called The Swamp near Port Fairy in Victoria, in partnership with his brother-in-law William Walker. He named it Squattlesea Mere, after the seat of Sir Roger Wildrake in Sir Walter Scott's novel <span class="italic">Woodstock</span>; in his own novel <span class="italic">The Squatter's Dream</span> (1890) it is called Marshmead. It remained his home until 1858, when he bought a larger run, Murrabit, on the Murray River, but began to spend most of his time in Melbourne, where his family returned to Hartlands, the house his father had built at Heidelberg in 1839&#150;40.<br>
<br>Brown visited England and Ireland in 1860 and the following year, on 1 August, married Margaret Maria Riley at St Thomas's Church in Mulgoa, near Sydney, officially changing the spelling of his surname to Browne soon after. His wife belonged to the colonial aristocracy, her father and grandfather having been among the first importers of Saxon merino sheep into Australia. Browne and his wife had four sons and five daughters. Immediately after his marriage he suffered a financial collapse that brought his career as a landed proprietor to an end. From 1864 to 1869 he subsequently managed another sheep station, Bundidgeree, near Narrandera, New South Wales, owned by two of his wife's brothers. In April 1871, thanks to family influence, he began a new career as a public servant, being appointed police magistrate and, soon after, gold commissioner at Gulgong, then the centre of the richest goldfield in New South Wales. After ten years there he served successively as magistrate and mining warden at Dubbo, Armidale, and Albury, before retiring to Melbourne in 1895. He died at his home, Iona, Kensington Road, South Yarra, Victoria, on 11 March 1915 and was buried in Brighton cemetery, Melbourne.<br>
<br>Browne wrote sixteen novels, all under the pseudonym Rolf Boldrewood, borrowed from Scott's <span class="italic">Marmion</span>. Eleven of them were serialized in Australian magazines in the 1870s and early 1880s, but it was not until <span class="italic">Robbery under Arms</span>, his classic tale of bushranging, cattle stealing, and goldmining, was published in London in 1888 that he became well known. Like his other novels, of which the best is <span class="italic">The Miner's Right</span> (1890), it exactly suited the prevailing British taste for exotic adventure stories. In Australia, Browne's exaggerated respect for rank and his predilection for gentlemanly English heroes were mocked by his younger, more nationalistic contemporaries, but for all their romantic absurdities his best novels were deservedly praised for the authenticity of their scenes of life in the bush, their convincing rendition of Australian speech and character, and their lively evocation of recent historical events.<br>
