<span class="headword">Pitts family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1737&#150;1870), <span class="occ">silversmiths</span>, can be traced back to <a name="cosubject_76418"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [ii] Pitts</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1794/5?)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Thomas [i] Pitts of St Mary, Whitechapel, London. He was apprenticed to Charles Hatfield in 1737 and turned over to David Willaume in 1742, taking his freedom in 1744. From 1767 to 1793 he lived at the sign of the Golden Cup, Air Street, St James, Westminster. The mark TP in a square box, presumably entered in a register of the Goldsmiths' Company, now lost, is assumed to be his. His trade card announced him as a working silversmith, making and selling all sorts of large and small plate. He produced dessert baskets and stands, and specialized in epergnes&#151;an elaborate type of centrepiece for table decoration&#151;some of these being in fashionable chinoiserie style. These wares were retailed through Parker and Wakelin and other suppliers to the luxury domestic plate market. It is not known when he died but, according to the rate books, Thomas's Air Street premises were taken over in 1794/5 by the silversmith Paul Storr.<br>
<br>Thomas's sons, Thomas [iii], <a name="cosubject_76420"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Pitts</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1755, <em>d.</em> after 1806)<span class="occ"></span>, and Joseph [i], were apprenticed to him in 1767, 1769, and 1772 respectively. The younger Thomas's registered mark was TP in an oval. Joseph Pitts was turned over immediately to Philip Day, plate case maker and leather-seller, and when made free in 1781 described himself as a plate case maker, a practitioner of an important ancillary craft to that of the silversmith; he was at Frith Street in the same year, when he took an apprentice. William [i] Pitts took his freedom in 1784, having registered his first mark, WP in an oval, as a platemaker at 17 St Martin's Street, Leicester Fields. He married Mary Armitage on 30 December 1782. A second registration in 1786 gave his address as 26 Litchfield Street, which remained good for the third, in partnership with Joseph Preedy, registered as W.P over I.P in an oval. Pitts and Preedy produced the same wares as Pitts's father. In the Regency period they took up the manufacture of ornate candelabra in a neo-rococo style. His fourth registration, in 1799, shows him trading alone at 15 Little Wild Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields; for the fifth, in 1806, he was at 14 James Street, Lambeth Marsh, and in the same year his own son William [ii] Pitts was apprenticed to him. Insurance taken out on the James Street premises covered two timber workshops, one behind and one adjoining the house, with &pound;600 cover for stock and tools.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22346"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Pitts</span>  (1789&#150;1840)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 9 November 1789 and baptized on 13 January 1790 at St Anne's, Soho, Westminster. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1811, before completing his apprenticeship. In 1812 he won the Isis gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts for modelling. At least five children were born of his early marriage, about 1809, his wife being named Mary. The eldest, Thomas [iv] (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1810), became an artist, and William [iii] (<i>b</i>. 1811), a sculptor; a daughter, Mary, of whom nothing is known, was followed by <a href="#cosubject_76418">Joseph [ii] [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who also became a sculptor, and Frederick (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1832). Between about 1815 and 1830 William [ii] led a peripatetic existence, moving from one address in Westminster to another and being described as a silver chaser, but in 1818, when he was at 24 York Row, Kennington, his insurance policy described him as a modeller and chaser, and also a dealer in china, glass, and earthenware, for which his cover was &pound;200 for stock and goods. In 1830 he moved to 5 Watkin's Terrace, Ebury Street, Pimlico.<br>
<br>A most versatile artist, William modelled numerous figures, busts and bas-reliefs for public monuments, private houses, and churches. He exhibited at the Royal Academy (1823&#150;40) and at the British Institution (1824&#150;34). He painted pictures and designed china, including a Davenport service ordered by William IV. He was ambidextrous, using either hand, or both together, for drawing and modelling. The sculptors Flaxman, Westmacott, and Chantrey were among his friends. William undertook a range of commissions as a jobbing chaser of metalwork, working for Rundells, the royal goldsmiths, for other firms, and on his own behalf. He worked at Rundells' Dean Street premises chasing panels on the &#145;shield of Achilles&#146; designed by Flaxman for Rundells; made in silver gilt, one example was purchased by George IV for 2000 guineas and displayed prominently at his coronation banquet in July 1821. Pitts subsequently prepared a copper version of the Achilles shield but died before it was finished; this was displayed at the London exhibitions of 1851 and 1862 and much admired. The <span class="italic">Journal of Art and Design</span> (1850) described it as &#145;the finest piece of modelling for metal-work which has ever been produced in England&#146;  (p. 109). Pitts also chased the greater portion of the silver-gilt shield designed by Thomas Stothard, retailed by Green, Ward, and Green, and presented by the City merchants and bankers to the duke of Wellington in 1822. He made a silver model for Lord Arlen of Hubert Le Sueur's equestrian statue of Charles I. Between 1830 and 1840 he variously designed and modelled many of the candelabra, epergnes, and plate made for presentation, including the vast masonic tribute presented to the duke of Sussex. From 1829 to 1831 he carved reliefs for several rooms at Buckingham Palace, but in September of the latter year he was obliged to plead with the Treasury for payment of &pound;550 outstanding from the agreed sum of &pound;700.<br>
<br>Despite his many commissions, William [ii] Pitts became overwhelmed by a series of financial and professional set-backs, and on the morning of 6 April 1840 he died at his home, 5 Watkin's Terrace, from an overdose of laudanum. The inquest disclosed that although negotiations were in hand for him to model for Mortimer and Hunt, jewellers, which would have brought him a goodly income, his design for the Nelson monument had been rejected, and he was concerned that a large commission for a gentleman in the country, which should have been completed, was still unfinished. William left a widow, his daughter Mary, and the infant Frederick totally unprovided for, his older sons Thomas [iv] and William [iii] having been employed as his assistants. Chantrey and other friends opened a fund to assist the family, and in 1842 Mrs Pitts received a charitable donation of &pound;30 from the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>The third son of William [ii] Pitts, <a name="cosubject_76419"></a><span class="headword">Joseph [ii] Pitts</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1821, <em>d.</em> 1880)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London, won the Society of Artists' silver Isis medal in 1831 for a bust and the silver medal for a group of figures in bas-relief five years later. He and his brother William remained briefly at Watkin's Terrace with their mother after their father's death. After 1845 Joseph is known to have moved around Westminster; between 1842 and 1846 he showed various busts, including those of Wellington, two of the prince consort, and one of Miss Symes, at the Royal Academy. His bust of George Stephenson, shown in 1846, is now in the National Portrait Gallery. He married in 1854 Augusta Mary Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knapp (1837/8&#150;1908), with whom he had a daughter. They settled at Barnes, where he died at their home, Westfield Cottage, on 31 August 1880, having suffered from diabetes.<br>
