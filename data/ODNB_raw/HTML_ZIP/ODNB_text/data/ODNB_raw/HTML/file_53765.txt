<span class="headword">Muhammad &#145;Abdallah Hasan</span> <span class="st"> [Muhammad &#145;Abd All&#257;h Hasan]</span>  (1856&#150;1920/21), <span class="occ">religious leader</span>, was born north of Buuhoodle, Somaliland, the eldest son of an Ogaden father, Sheikh &#145;Abdallah Hasan, and a Dhulbahanta mother, Timiro Seed Magan. Contemporary Britons called him the &#145;Mad Mullah&#146;, but most Somalis referred to him by the Islamic religious titles of <i>sayyid</i> or <i>wadaad</i>. From 1899 to 1920 Sayyid Muhammad led Somalis in a holy war against Christian foreign rule, and in particular against the British administration of the Somaliland protectorate and its local Somali supporters.<br>
<br>After memorizing the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, the young Muhammad had set out on a career of peripatetic Islamic learning which, in the early 1890s, brought him to Mecca. There he joined the Salihiyyah, the reformist Sufi brotherhood founded by the Sudanese Muhammad Salih. On his return to Berbera, by then under British colonial protection (1884&#150;1960), he alienated both the Qadiriyyah brotherhood and the British administration through his reformist theological stances. He puritanically objected to any form of indulgence of the senses during devotional practice and insisted that any Muslim who supported or even tolerated Christian rule in his country deserved to be harassed and killed.<br>
<br>About 1897 Sayyid Muhammad moved inland and founded his own religious settlement in Qoryaweyn. There he began to attract adherents, known as dervishes, who, in joining, submitted to his authority and renounced their clan identity for a religious (Muslim, Salihi) one. Armed hostilities began in 1900. Between 1900 and 1904 the British launched four major expeditions, led by men such as Lieutenant-Colonel E. J. E. Swayne, Brigadier-General W. H. Manning, and Major-General C. Egerton. However, the elusiveness of the enemy and the harsh, dry terrain made supply problems insuperable and doomed any formal, large-scale war effort. The peace agreement of March 1904 gave Sayyid Muhammad an autonomous area near Illig and a sea port. He immediately set out to use these to realize some of his state-building ambitions and to extend his influence. He had surrounded himself with a council of special advisers (<i>qusuusi</i>) and a personal bodyguard of low-caste people (<i>gaarhaye</i>). He had organized the army into four commands and had created seven administrative divisions, each formally associated with the name of one of his many wives (who included Barni Hirsi, the mother of his eldest son, Mahdi). He sent out and received caravans, and his dhows (flying the dervish flag showing a white turban) plied the seas, exporting hides, skins, and gum in return for firearms, food supplies, and clothing. He conducted an active diplomacy. Apart from writing letters in Arabic, occasionally containing elaborate Islamic theological and jurisprudential arguments about the duty of holy war, he composed a wide range of oral poetry in Somali, from peaceful overture to withering attack.<br>
<br>In 1909, Sayyid Muhammad's Somali opponents, with Italian and British aid, persuaded the leader of the Salihiyyah in Mecca to excommunicate him by letter. Although some Somalis believed that the letter was falsified, it sowed discord in the ranks of his followers. In the following years he moved his headquarters to Talah and institutionalized his power by building more than forty fortresses (where possible surrounded by cultivated fields) in different parts of the country. As war approached in 1914, he intensified his international diplomacy and participated in the international pan-Islamic movement which supported the Ottoman empire against its Christian enemies. It was not until early 1920 that the British were able to move against the sayyid, with aerial bombardments of Talah and other forts. Thus his movement was broken, though he himself escaped. In December 1920 or January 1921, while settled in Imey, the man who had dominated the history of Somaliland for twenty-one years fell sick, probably with influenza, and died near Imey.<br>
<br>Somalis remember Sayyid Muhammad in many ways: as the instigator of ruinous inter-clan warfare as well as the untiring defender of their religion, and as a ruthless local potentate as well as the first fighter for their national independence. Perhaps he was all of this and more. One of his poems contains his own reflections on his career:<blockquote>Although I failed to have a flag flown from here to Nairobi, did I not gain religious honour and paradise in victory and defeat? Although I failed to obtain the luscious pastures of the &#145;Iid and the Nugaal as grazing, did I not successfully ride my steed out to war? Although I failed to get people to show me sympathy and acknowledge their kinship with me, did I not gain God's mercy and [the reward of seeing] the Prophet's countenance? (Jaamac Cumar Ciise, 293)</blockquote>
