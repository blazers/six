<span class="headword">Hooke <span class="st"> [Hook]</span>,  William</span>  (1600/01&#150;1678), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was the second son of William Hooke of Hook, Hampshire. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 19 May 1620, aged nineteen, graduated BA that year, and proceeded MA in 1623. He became rector of Upper Clatford, Hampshire, on 4 May 1627. In May 1630 he married Jane (<i>fl</i>. 1622&#150;1681), daughter of Richard Whalley of Kirketon and Screveton, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Frances Cromwell. She was sister to Edward Whalley the future regicide, niece to Joan, Lady Barrington, and cousin of Oliver Cromwell; the Barrington family papers include letters from William and Jane Hooke. In 1631 they moved to Axmouth, Devon, where Hooke became vicar on 26 July 1632. He took his family to New England some time after October 1637.<br>
<br>Hooke settled at Taunton (Cohannet), Massachusetts, within the Plymouth patent. He gathered a church and, according to Thomas Lechford, was reordained by a schoolmaster and a husbandman. On 23 July 1640 he preached on the first official fast day for England observed in New England. The sermon was printed as <span class="italic">New Englands Tears for Old Englands Feares</span> (1641), one of the first tracts to reach the London press from the puritan colonies. Its publication was part of a strategy to reassure the godly in England that colonists, though absent, had not deserted their homeland. Hooke's sequel, <span class="italic">New Englands Sence of Old-England and Irelands Sorrows</span>, appeared in 1645.<br>
<br>In 1644 Hooke moved to be teacher to the New Haven church, alongside its pastor, John Davenport. By 1653 New Haven faced threats from the Dutch and from Indians, and was in serious economic difficulties. Hooke wrote to Oliver Cromwell about the colony's straits, and its consequent loss of settlers: many, he reported, liked Cromwell's plans to move colonists to Ireland; others were &#145;more willing &hellip; once more (if God will) to salute their native soyle&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 1.564&#150;5). Hooke's son <a href="#cosubject_13685">John Hooke [<i>see below</i>]</a> had already left, and Hooke and Davenport were on the brink of returning to England. In July 1654 Davenport wrote that Hooke would stay another year until new ministers could be found, &#145;though he thinkes to send his family before, for the good of his posterity, whereunto he hath strong encouragements&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Davenport</span>, 93). Davenport in the end remained in New England. Jane Hooke returned to England in 1654 with her remaining children: William, Walter, Caleb, Eliazar, Ebenezer, Jane, Elizabeth, and Mary. Her husband followed in October 1656.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1657 Hooke wrote to John Winthrop the younger &#145;I am not, as yet, settled, the protector having engaged me to Him, not long after my landing.&#146; He told of Cromwell's &#145;desire &hellip; that a church may be gathered in his family&#146;, but predicted difficulties  (<span class="italic">Massachusetts Historical Society Collections</span>, 3rd ser., 1, 1846, 182). He acted as one of Cromwell's chaplains. On 24 October 1657 he was appointed an assistant to the Middlesex commission. Early in 1658 he became master of the Savoy, London, which Cromwell was using to accommodate members of his court. Later that year representatives from congregationalist churches met there, for the Savoy conference. In 1659 Hooke printed the catechism he and Davenport had used in New Haven.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, the <span class="roman">Act for Confirmation of Leases</span> of 18 December 1660 prevented Hooke from continuing as master of the Savoy. He remained in London and in 1661 published with Joseph Caryl Davenport's <span class="italic">The Saints Anchor-Hold</span>. He and Jane Hooke maintained contact with New England by letter, and probably influenced Edward Whalley's decision to emigrate there with William Goffe. Hooke went into hiding in March 1663 when a letter to Davenport, reporting English news, was intercepted: John Winthrop the younger, visiting London to resolve a dispute between New Haven and Connecticut, met the parties at Hooke's secret lodgings. Jane Hooke collected money and clothing for colonists. On 20 April 1672 Hooke was licensed as a congregationalist minister at Richard Loton's house, Spital Yard, Bishopsgate. The following year he published <span class="italic">The Priviledge of the Saints on Earth</span>, a discourse on <span class="roman">Hezekiah</span> and the building of the new Jerusalem on earth. He died on 21 March 1678 and was buried at Bunhill Fields. His final work, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Witnesses</span>, appeared in 1681.<br>

<a name="cosubject_13685"></a><span class="headword">John Hooke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1634, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, second son of William, was baptized at Axmouth, Devon, on 9 February 1634 and grew up in New England. He left Harvard without taking a degree, matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1652, and graduated BA in 1654. He was rector of Kingsworthy, Hampshire, from 3 November 1658 until some time before 29 January 1661, when his successor was instituted. Thereafter, he never took a parish living, although he conformed; he subscribed on 21 August 1662 as of the Savoy Chapel, London (surprisingly, but no doubt because of his father's connections). He was admitted as a chaplain there on 30 July 1663, and held office until 1702 when the Savoy Hospital foundation was dissolved. He had lived for a time in Berkshire, but after 1702 lived in Basingstoke, Hampshire, preaching &#145;to a separate congregation from the Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>). He died in 1710 and was buried there on 26 April. He was survived by his wife, Elianor (<i>d</i>. 1714), and three daughters.<br>
