<span class="headword">Pengelly,  William</span>  (1812&#150;1894), <span class="occ">geologist and archaeologist</span>, was born on 12 January 1812 at East Looe, Cornwall, the first of ten children of Richard Pengelly (1787&#150;1861), mariner, and his wife, Sarah (1787&#150;1881), daughter of Abraham and Mary Prout of Millbrook, Cornwall. Pengelly attended two schools in East Looe before beginning work on his father's coasting vessel at the age of twelve. He left the ship's crew four years later, on the death of his younger brother, Richard, and devoted much time to reading and self-instruction in mathematics. About 1836, influenced by an aunt and uncle who lived there, he moved to Torquay and opened a school based on the Pestalozzian method, teaching mathematics. In 1846 he gave up the school to become a private tutor in mathematics and the natural sciences, and began a long career of lecturing around the country in subjects including astronomy, geology, palaeontology, and archaeology. Pengelly's desire to make education and learning more accessible led him to found the Torquay Young Men's Society in 1837 (in 1846 renamed the Torquay Mechanics' Institute); the Torquay Natural History Society in 1844; and the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Literature, Science, and Art in 1862.<br>
<br>Pengelly married his cousin Mary Ann Mudge on 18 June 1838. The couple had six children, but all except their son Alfred died in infancy or childhood. Mary died in 1851, and on 28 June 1853 Pengelly married Lydia Spriggs, of a Quaker family of Worcester, with whom he had two daughters; the younger, Hester, became his biographer.<br>
<br>Pengelly's interests centred on the geology and palaeontology of Devon and Cornwall, and human prehistory, on which he published more than a hundred papers. He made significant contributions to the literature on the geology of Devon and Cornwall, and his collecting activities provided important primary material for other workers and students. In 1860 Miss Angela (later Baroness) Burdett-Coutts, a former pupil, provided Pengelly with funds to collect fossil plant material from the Tertiary lignite deposits of Bovey Tracey. Pengelly reviewed the geology of these deposits in an important paper read to the Royal Society in 1862, and in 1863 was elected a fellow of the society.<br>
<br>Pengelly's most lasting and original contributions to the sciences remain his work on Devon caves and their associated human prehistory. On his arrival in Torquay he took an interest in Kent's Cavern, which had been excavated between 1825 and 1829 by the Revd John MacEnery, who claimed to have recovered flint artefacts together with bones from extinct animals. Pengelly's first excavations began in 1846 with the express purpose of attempting to demonstrate whether or not artefacts were contemporaneous with an extinct fauna, but his excavation controls were in their infancy and there was some disagreement with colleagues in interpreting the results. In 1858, however, an opportunity arose to investigate a newly discovered cave at Brixham, Devon, untouched by previous excavation. The Geological Society of London formed a committee for its investigation, with Pengelly in charge of supervising the excavations using an improved three-dimensional process of excavation and recording. Preliminary findings from Brixham were published in outline in Sir Charles Lyell's <span class="italic">Geological Evidence on the Antiquity of Man</span> (1863), and were central in the paradigm shift in accepting that humans had an ancient &#145;prehistory&#146;. Pengelly returned to excavating Kent's Cavern with the support of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and between 1865 and 1880 he refined his methods of excavation still further, providing geologists and archaeologists with vast collections of faunal and cultural remains with associated contextual data.<br>
<br>While Pengelly's motivation and application contributed greatly to his success, he was, in moving to Torquay, also in the right place at the right time. From the mid-nineteenth century Torquay became a highly fashionable resort for the middle and upper classes and thus Pengelly was able to meet influential people, and maintain important personal contacts over and above maintaining a voluminous correspondence. In addition, the geological and archaeological sites in the locality contained deposits in fields which were of central interest in the international scientific community of his time. Pengelly also found, in attending the British Association for the Advancement of Science meetings, an invaluable vehicle for communicating and maintaining contacts. He attended every meeting between 1856 and 1889, except for that in Montreal in 1884. He was president of the association's geological section in 1877, and the anthropological section in 1883. The Geological Society, of which he had been a fellow since 1850, presented him with the Lyell medal in 1886 for his contributions to geological science.<br>
<br>Pengelly had great energy and mental ability, and was an excellent communicator, especially as a lecturer, and meticulous in all he did. A benevolent man, he was noted by all that knew him for his charm and genial manner, and had a great sense of humour and ready wit&#151;his habit of punning earned him the nickname of &#145;Pun-gelly&#146; from friends at British Association meetings. Although baptized and brought up in the Church of England, Pengelly, who was teetotal, had become by the 1840s a convert to the tenets of the Society of Friends, whom he joined by the time of his second marriage. His firmly held nonconformist beliefs effectively disqualified him from applying for certain salaried appointments in which he was interested. Pengelly died at his home, Lamorna, Furze Hill Road, Torquay, on 16 March 1894, and was buried at the Torquay cemetery on 22 March.<br>
