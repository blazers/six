<span class="headword">Weaver,  John</span>  (1673&#150;1760), <span class="occ">dancer and choreographer</span>, the son of John Weaver (<i>d</i>. 1701) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1721), was baptized at the abbey church of Holy Cross, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 21 July 1673. His father, who taught dancing to pupils at Shrewsbury School, took his family to Oxford after his son's birth and ran a dancing school and boarding-house in Holywell, under the jurisdiction of the vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford. Weaver spent his early years at Oxford but was educated at Shrewsbury School, presumably as a boarder. He trained as a dancing-master either under his father in Oxford or under Edward Dyer in Shrewsbury. He is recorded as a dancing-master in Milk Street, Shrewsbury, in 1695&#150;6 but appears to have left for London by 1697. From then, until his return to Shrewsbury in 1708, he established a reputation both as a theatrical dancer and as an authority on dance notation. His translations from Feuillet&#151;<span class="italic">Orchesography</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">A Small Treatise of Time and Cadence in Dancing</span> (1706)&#151;and his notation of Isaac's dances&#151;<span class="italic">A Collection of Ball-Dances Performed at Court</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">The Union</span> (1707)&#151;had a significant influence on the development and status of dance in England. During this first period in London he also began his experiments as a choreographer, which have led many dance historians in the twentieth century to see Weaver as &#145;one of the most far-sighted and important early exponents of <i>ballet d'action</i>&#146;  (Ralph, 84).<br>
<br>By 1702 Weaver had married his first wife, Catherine. They had seven children. The first three were baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London. John, who died in infancy, was baptized on 27 December 1702; Elizabeth on 12 August 1704; and Katherine on 19 August 1705 (buried 4 May 1706). The last four were baptized in Shrewsbury, where Weaver had returned to set up a dancing school and to write his influential <span class="italic">An Essay towards an History of Dancing</span> (1712). Anne Elizabeth was baptized on 12 March 1708 at St Julian's Church. John, on 11 July 1709; Richard, on 3 November 1710; and Catherine, on 13 September 1712, all at St Chad's Church. Weaver's wife died giving birth and was buried on the same day as their last child was baptized and in the same month as Weaver's <span class="italic">Essay</span> was published. The stir caused by its publication, particularly in the pages of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and <span class="italic">The Lover</span>, obscures what little is known about Weaver's personal life during these critical years. In 1716 his second wife, Susanna, who was twenty-eight years younger than he, gave birth to the first of their five children. Prisilla was baptized on 31 May 1716 at St Chad's; Dorothy on 20 January 1721 at St Mary's; Anne on 3 May 1722 at St Alkmund's; Susannah on 10 September 1723 at St Alkmund's; and William on 21 June 1728 at St Alkmund's.<br>
<br>The years that followed Prisilla's birth saw Weaver's second and most creative period as a dancer and choreographer in London. Between March 1717 and April 1721 he composed and directed at Drury Lane three serious dance pantomimes (records of one of these no longer survive) and two grotesque dance pantomimes &#145;after the manner of the Modern Italians, such as Harlequin, Scaramouch, etc&#146;  (J. Weaver, <span class="italic">The History of the Mimes and Pantomimes</span>, 1728, 45). He danced one of the major roles in all these entertainments, as well as a variety of ordinary stage dances throughout this period. He also gave a series of anatomical lectures to an audience of distinguished dancing-masters, who subscribed to a printed version of them which was published in 1721. These lectures &#145;are the first attempt to base dancing and dance instruction on the knowledge of the body&#146;  (Sachs, 395). Between 27 April 1721 and 16 March 1728 Weaver turned his back on the London stage and re-established his dancing school in Shrewsbury. He lived and taught in Shrewsbury for the rest of his life, and returned to Drury Lane only on three brief occasions. In 1728 and in 1729 he both danced in and directed pantomimes in collaboration with Monsieur Roger, a French Pierrot dancer, while in 1733 he choreographed his last serious entertainment, <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>. This was the only experiment of his in which he did not perform.<br>
<br>It was Weaver, rather than John Rich, who introduced into England entertainments called pantomimes. In 1703 he staged at Drury Lane, probably in late February or early March, <span class="italic">The Tavern Bilkers</span>, which he describes as &#145;the first entertainment that appeared on the English Stage, where the Representation and Story was carried on by Dancing Action and Motion only&#146;. The text does not survive, but it is clear that this was a pantomime that involved &#145;commedia&#146; characters such as Harlequin and what Weaver terms &#145;grotesque dancing&#146;. <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span> (1717), <span class="italic">Harlequin Turned Judge</span> (1717), and the two comic interludes Weaver composed for <span class="italic">Perseus and Andromeda</span> (1728) were also this type of pantomime. Apart from their emphasis on dancing, all of them must have been similar to the rival burlesques that Rich produced at Lincoln's Inn Fields from 1717 to 1726, and that were based on themes and plots associated with Weaver's work. Weaver's serious compositions, however, were of a different type. They were &#145;attempted in imitation of the pantomimes of the Ancient Greeks and Romans&#146;. <span class="italic">The Loves of Mars and Venus</span> (1717) was the most successful with contemporary audiences of these experiments. The published text of its danced action, together with the text of <span class="italic">Orpheus and Eurydice</span> (1718) and his publications on dance, establish Weaver as &#145;the major figure in British dance before the present [twentieth] century&#146;  (Ralph, ix). As an innovator he was closer to Fokine than Noverre in his belief that &#145;there is no dividing line between pantomime and dance&#146;  (Cohen, 47).<br>
<br>In Shrewsbury, Weaver was a respected and respectable figure, &#145;a little, dapper, cheerful man&#146;  (Owen and Blakeway, 2.152, n. 1). His activities and longevity as a dancing-master in the town are remembered with warmth and respect by Dr Burney. In London, however, his reputation was more complex:<blockquote>
<div>Happy if not a Tavern cou'd be found,<br>
</div>
<div>Or Bawdy-house in fifty Miles around.<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Tho' always getting, he is always poor.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Dancing-Master</span>, 16&#150;17)</blockquote>How far such satires reflected his character or revealed antipathy to the stage and, in particular, to dance, it is difficult to discern. As a dancer Weaver &#145;shewed the Passions to great Advantage&#146;  (Essex, preface, p. ix). For Richard Steele, he was:<blockquote>
<div>&hellip; corruptor of this present age,<br>
</div>
<div>Who first taught silent sins upon the stage.<br>
</div> (BL, Add. MS 25391, fol. 3<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Weaver died at his home, at the Market Place, Shrewsbury, on 24 September 1760, and was buried in the south aisle of Old St Chad's Church on 28 September. The inscription on his grave, now destroyed, is preserved in BL, Add. MS 21236, fol. 65<i>b</i>., and gave his age as ninety. He was in fact eighty-seven.<br>
