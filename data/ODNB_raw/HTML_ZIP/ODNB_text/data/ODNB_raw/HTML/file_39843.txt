<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sitwell, Sir  Sacheverell</span>, sixth baronet  (1897&#150;1988), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 15 November 1897 in his parents' house, Belvoir Terrace, in The Crescent, Scarborough, the third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36115/', "Sir George Reresby Sitwell, fourth baronet (1860&#150;1943)")</script>, genealogist and antiquary, and his wife, Lady Ida Emily Augusta Denison (<i>d</i>. 1937), fourth child and third daughter of the first earl of Londesborough.<br>
<br>Sacheverell Sitwell, like his elder sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36113/', "Dame Edith Sitwell")</script>, and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36114/', "Sir (Francis) Osbert Sacheverell Sitwell")</script>, lived for the arts. One of the most prolific of literary families, their reputations varied from decade to decade. Always the centre of spirited controversy, during the period of the Second World War, Edith found her widest audience, Osbert achieved wide acclaim for his autobiographical volumes, and Sacheverell's cultural studies became standard fare for devotees of art, architecture, and music.<br>
<br>Sacheverell's childhood, more indulged than Osbert's and more at a remove from Edith's, was idyllic, according to what he wrote years later in <span class="italic">Splendours and Miseries</span> (1943). While still in his teens, he carried on extensive correspondence with some of the foremost artists, musicians, and avant-garde figures of the day. When he left Eton College in 1916, he declared himself a bibliophile and dedicated intellectual. &#145;He set himself&#146;, Osbert wrote, &#145;with an energy and intensity that were remarkable to amass knowledge <i>he</i> wanted to amass&#146;  (O. Sitwell, <span class="italic">The Scarlet Tree</span>, 1946, 273). For dubious reasons he found formal education at Balliol College, Oxford, disappointing and did not pursue a degree. Instead, he joined Osbert in London to mount exhibitions of contemporary French art and hold salons to which they invited luminaries from the literary world.<br>
<br>Sacheverell Sitwell's first publication, <span class="italic">The People's Palace</span> (1918)&#151;a slight work of fourteen poems&#151;received a cool reception; nor did his second collection of verse, <span class="italic">The Hundred and One Harlequins</span> (1922), impress the critics. Two years later he published <span class="italic">Southern Baroque Art</span>, his first work of prose; and this study of the painting, architecture, and music of Italy and Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries drew laudations. <span class="italic">German Baroque Art</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Gothick North</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">British Architecture and Craftsmen</span> (1945) followed in profusion. Other books, such as <span class="italic">Roumanian Journey</span> (1938), <span class="italic">The Netherlands</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">Bridge of the Brocard Sash</span> (1959), took their origins from his travels.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1925 Sitwell took time from his research and writing to marry Georgia Doble (<i>d</i>. 1980), an attractive Canadian from a prominent banking family, in Paris at the Anglican church of St George. They made a handsome pair: he, tall and slim (6 feet 4 inches), with a distinguished look and distinguished carriage; she, stately, slender, dark-haired with light olive skin and widely spaced hazel-green eyes. All things considered, their marriage was a good one, and her death in 1980 was a trying occasion for Sitwell and their two sons, Francis and Reresby. The award in 1981 of the Royal Society of Literature's Benson medal alleviated some of his pain, as did his being made a Companion of Honour in 1984. Succession to the baronetcy in 1969 upon Osbert's death had followed as a matter of course.<br>
<br>Sitwell's sixteenth volume of poetry, <span class="italic">An Indian Summer</span> (1982), was his last book. Although this collection of 100 poems is an interesting brew of wisdom and melancholy, beauty and rapture, it is as a prose writer that he will be remembered. His <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1948) are worthy of attention, but his strength is to be found in his studies of art and literature. Among his books on music and composers, <span class="italic">Mozart</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Liszt</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Scarlatti</span> (1935) have the most staying power.<br>
<br>Prominent among Sacheverell Sitwell's more than sixty books are his autobiographical volumes, <span class="italic">All Summer in a Day</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Dance of the Quick and the Dead</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">For Want of a Golden City</span> (1973), in which he wrote of his family and friends, his responses to what he found most appealing. With something of an existential touch, he dilated upon oral and visual memories, focused upon all he preferred to recollect, and glossed over most troublesome aspects of his days and years. He lived latterly at Weston Hall, Towcester, Northamptonshire. Sacheverell Sitwell died on 1 October 1988.<br>
