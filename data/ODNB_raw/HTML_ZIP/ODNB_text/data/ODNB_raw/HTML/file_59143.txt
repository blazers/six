<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Townsend,  Peter Woolridge</span>  (1914&#150;1995), <span class="occ">air force officer and official in the royal household</span>, was born in Burma on 22 November 1914, into the large family of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Copleston Townsend (<i>b</i>. 1864), an officer in the Indian army and district commissioner in Burma. He was educated at Haileybury College (which he loathed, and where he was remembered as shy and studious) before entering the Royal Air Force College at Cranwell in 1933. By the age of twenty-seven he held the rank of wing commander, and following the outbreak of the Second World War he proceeded to display gallantry of the highest order. Flying initially in a Hurricane, later in a Spitfire, he brought down the first German bomber to crash in England since the First World War, and in the space of three years he was mentioned in dispatches and received the DSO and the DFC and bar. He was ultimately promoted group captain.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1941 Townsend married (Cecil) Rosemary Pawle (1921&#150;2004), the daughter of Colonel Hanbury Pawle, of Widford, Hertfordshire. The marriage resulted in the birth of two sons, but it was soon under strain. Meanwhile, Townsend was seconded in 1944 on what was initially to have been a three-month appointment as an equerry to George VI. In 1947, his secondment having been extended (he eventually served at court for nine years), Townsend accompanied the king and queen and the two princesses on their strenuous tour of South Africa. There was at this time no question of any romance between Townsend and Princess Margaret [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76713/', "Margaret Rose, Princess")</script>]. After only three years with the king he was appointed CVO in recognition of his contribution to the success of the tour, and in 1950 he became deputy master of his majesty's household. Meanwhile, Townsend's marriage had ended in divorce, although he had been the &#145;innocent party&#146;.<br>
<br>On the death of George VI in 1952 Townsend moved to Clarence House as comptroller to Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, and was appointed an equerry to the new queen, Elizabeth II. Now in even closer proximity than before to Princess Margaret, who was also living at Clarence House, Townsend and the princess fell in love; the intimate nature of their relationship was provocatively broadcast to the world on coronation day 1953, when the princess brushed some fluff from Townsend's uniform. The man in whom Townsend chose to confide was Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to the king and someone who had played a prominent part only seventeen years before in the abdication crisis. &#145;Either you're mad or bad&#146;, Lascelles told him  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 June 1995). He was neither, and in later years, when Lascelles lived in retirement at Kensington Palace, Princess Margaret declined to speak to him on the grounds that she considered him to have been the man who had ruined her life.<br>
<br>With memories of the abdication still raw, the establishment moved swiftly to separate the 38-year-old group captain and the 23-year-old princess, only third in line of succession to the throne. On the eve of a visit to Rhodesia by the queen mother and Princess Margaret, Townsend, instead of accompanying them, was whisked away to Brussels as air attach&eacute;. Under the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Act</span> of 1772 Princess Margaret required the consent of the monarch to marry, and to her grandmother Queen Mary and to her mother the situation which had resulted in the abdication had been anathema. Such were the social rules at the time that as a divorcee Townsend would not even have been granted entrance to the royal enclosure at Ascot. A cooling-off period was the best the royal family could hope for at this stage, but Townsend and the princess remained in constant touch, with the princess turning for advice not to the impetuous archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, but to a young Cambridge chaplain, Simon Phipps, later bishop of Lincoln and godfather to her son.<br>
<br>Although on attaining the age of twenty-five Princess Margaret could have sought the consent of parliament to her marriage had permission been withheld by the queen, there was never any question of such a constitutional hiatus; there was, indeed, no serious possibility of the marriage ever taking place without the princess renouncing her rights to the throne, which Townsend would never have allowed her to do. In 1955, with Townsend's support and in the face of intense press speculation, the princess issued a dignified announcement that &#145;mindful of the Church's teaching that marriage is indissoluble&#146; she had decided not to marry Group Captain Townsend. The irony of her later failed marriage to Lord Snowdon only added poignancy to the memories of a genuine but sadly unrealistic love affair.<br>
<br>Group Captain Peter Townsend left England shortly after the princess's announcement, and travelled round the world, working on a book, <span class="italic">Earth my Friend</span>, which was published in 1959. In the same year he made a second, very happy, marriage, to Marie-Luce Jamagne, the daughter of Franz Jamagne of Brussels, with whom he had a son and two daughters. He travelled extensively in Africa, India, South America, Canada, and the United States, and eventually settled down with his wife in France, where he commenced a successful career as a writer, producing a number of books about the battle of Britain and about the impact of war on the individual, and, in 1978, a balanced and charitable autobiography, <span class="italic">Time and Chance</span>. Possessed of natural diffidence, generosity, charm, and the modesty that became a hero, he made no secret in old age of his relief that things had turned out the way they did. He died at his home, La Mare aux Oiseaux, Route des Grands Coins, St L&eacute;ger-en-Yvelines, France, on 19 June 1995. He was survived by his wife, his two sons from his first marriage, and his three children from his second.<br>
