<span class="headword">Dakyns <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pattinson]</span>,  Winifred</span>  (1875&#150;1960), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 16 September 1875 at Bensham Lodge, Gateshead, co. Durham, the youngest daughter of John Pattinson, analytical chemist, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Swan. She was educated at Gateshead high school and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she met, and married on 21 June 1902, Henry Graham Dakyns (1873/4&#150;1937), a mechanical engineer.<br>
<br>During the First World War Winifred Dakyns (and to a lesser extent her husband) was involved with the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), run jointly by the British Red Cross and the order of St John. She worked closely with the director, Katharine Furse, and when Furse left in 1917 following a disagreement over the organization and employment of VAD nurses, Dakyns was one of a number of senior members who also left.<br>
<br>Shortly thereafter, in November 1917, Furse was appointed as the first director of the newly re-created Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) and looked to her former VAD colleagues to form the nucleus of the officer corps. In December Dakyns was appointed one of two assistant directors, working closely with Furse and with her deputy, Edith Crowdy, to draw up the terms and conditions of service for the WRNS. As the service grew, two more assistant directors were appointed and Dakyns assumed the title of assistant director (administration) with particular responsibility for the smooth running of the rapidly expanding service. She held this post until 1919, when the WRNS demobilized. Along with the other officers she was appointed CBE (military) &#145;for valuable services in connection with the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 9 May 1919), and, in respect of her service with the VAD, made an honorary serving sister of the order of St John of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>After the war Dakyns became honorary secretary of the University Women's Club and was actively concerned in its running for thirty years. Known as a woman whose firmness of character was overlain by a kind and gentle manner, she was living at Wickham Farmhouse, College Lane, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, at the time of her death at Cuckfield Hospital, Cuckfield, Sussex, on 22 January 1960.<br>
