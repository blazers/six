<span class="headword">Adami,  John George</span>  (1862&#150;1926), <span class="occ">pathologist</span>, was born on 12 January 1862 in the Albion Hotel, Piccadilly, Manchester. He was the second son of five sons and four daughters of John George Adami, hotel proprietor, and his wife, Sarah Ann Ellis, daughter of Thomas Leech of Urmston, Lancashire. His mother was the sister of Daniel John Leech (1840&#150;1900), professor of materia medica and therapeutics in the Victoria University and physician to the Manchester Royal Infirmary. The Adami name came from an Italian ancestor who migrated to Bavaria and became protestant in the sixteenth century. Both Adami's parents had many doctors in their families.<br>
<br>Adami was baptized in Manchester Cathedral, and at the age of ten he went to Old Trafford School. After matriculating, he moved to Owens College, Manchester, and passed the first part of the London BSc. In 1880 he entered Christ's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he was greatly influenced by, and later became a friend of, Sir Michael Foster. Even as a student Adami showed a broad interest in the place of science in the community, and delivered a paper to the exclusive Natural Science Club: &#145;The medical degree with special reference to the new Medical Act&#146;. He gained a first class in both parts of the natural science tripos (1882, 1884), and then worked for eight months at Breslau under Rudolf Heidenhain. From 1885 to 1887 he was house physician at the Royal Infirmary, Manchester. In 1888 he returned to Cambridge as university demonstrator in pathology. In 1889 Adami was exposed to rabies, and received anti-rabies immunization from the Pasteur Institute in Paris. He returned to the Pasteur Institute the following year and worked under the key French immunologists and bacteriologists Pierre Roux, Ilya Mechnikov, and Louis Pasteur. In March 1891 Adami was elected to a fellowship at Jesus College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>An old friend from Owens College drew Adami's attention to the new chair in pathology and bacteriology at McGill University, Montreal, and Adami was appointed in 1892. He found a young university and a department badly hampered by lack of funds, buildings, and equipment. These material needs were met by the generosity of J. H. R. Molson and Lord Strathcona, who endowed the chair of pathology and financed the pathology wing in the university and the Royal Victoria Hospital. Under Adami the hospital had an autopsy rate of 80 per cent. Adami was a good teacher with an original mind in research. He considered that the department of pathology should be of value to the community at large, and in 1894 he became bacteriologist to the department of agriculture. Montreal had great poverty, and was divided into French and British parts. Adami became involved in the campaign against pulmonary tuberculosis, and was the English president of the City Improvement League, which was concerned with city planning, water supplies, clean streets and rented accommodation. He was also the English president of the Child Welfare Exhibition of 1912, which made the public aware of increasing infant mortality, and chairman of a representative committee on venereal disease. Adami married Mary Stuart, daughter of James Alexander Cantlie, of Montreal, in 1894; they had a son and a daughter. His wife was intimately connected through her mother with Lord Strathcona and Lord Mountstephen, two great benefactors of McGill University. She died in 1916.<br>
<br>Adami contributed an important chapter on inflammation to Sir Clifford Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (1896), which attracted particular attention. In 1899 he was invited to apply for the chair of pathology at Cambridge; although tempted, he eventually declined the offer. He was elected FRS in 1905. Adami finished <span class="italic">The Principles of Pathology</span> during a sabbatical in 1906, while collaborating with Ludwig Aschoff in Marburg. It was an important teaching text, but somewhat too long for students. The book emphasized the role of functional as well as structural changes in disease. In 1911 Adami was elected president of the Canadian Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, and in 1912 he became president of the Association of American Physicians and the Royal Society of Canada. However, he realized that the idea that intestinal derangements (stasis and absorption of toxins) caused many diseases made its adherents appear obsessed, and in 1914 he wrote that &#145;[for the last fourteen years] I have largely permitted this particular field to lie fallow&#146;  (Adami, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 24 Jan 1914). In the same year Adami wrote to Sir William Osler, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, and formerly of McGill, indicating the desire of doctors for a medical history of the war. In due course Adami became assistant director of medical services (in charge of records) to the Canadian expeditionary force, and wrote <span class="italic">The War Story of the Canadian Army Medical Corps</span> (1918).<br>
<br>In 1919, with the support of William Osler and Sir Clifford Allbutt, Adami was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool. He was made CBE in the same year. The university was then in the throes of post-war expansion, its numbers having grown from under 900 in August 1914 to 2600 by 1919. Adami's chief service was to raise by appeal the large sum of &pound;360,000 for new buildings and equipment, and the endowment of new chairs and additional lectureships. Adami placed a high value on the contribution that the university could make to the then great commercial city of Liverpool. He strengthened the links between business and academic life and maintained the interest of the districts around the city. This made fund-raising easier. In particular, he raised money for a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research. He was an untiring and witty public speaker, accessible, genial, and energetic; he had a lively and well-stocked mind and a broad range of interests. His scientific judgement was good and his reputation in the university and city was high.<br>
<br>Adami developed a lymphoma about 1918 and suffered from great tiredness for two years. However, he remained active. He married, on 4 April 1922, Marie, elder daughter of the Revd Thomas Wilkinson, of Litherland, near Liverpool. They had no children. Adami received treatment for his lymphoma from Dr W. B. Coley in America, who was treating tumours with bacterial toxins. He died in Ruthin Castle, a private hospital in Ruthin, Denbighshire, on 29 August 1926. His funeral was four days later at Liverpool Cathedral and he was buried at Allerton cemetery. A memorial service for the University of Liverpool was held in the cathedral in October. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Adami's chief service to pathology was to link it more closely with clinical medicine, stressing always the importance of preventive medicine. Before the First World War he fought a campaign in Canada for public health and in particular child welfare and measures against tuberculosis. As chairman of the Medical Research Committee in 1917 on standardization of routine pathological methods, he was influential in the standardization of the Wassermann test for syphilis in British laboratories, and spoke out fearlessly on venereal disease in an address to the Royal Institute of Public Health, under the title &#145;The policy of the ostrich&#146; which was published in the <span class="italic">Canadian Medical Association Journal</span> in 1919. Adami also championed the use of immunization with BCG (attenuated bovine tubercle bacillus) for the prophylaxis of tuberculosis at a time when this approach was neglected in Great Britain.<br>
