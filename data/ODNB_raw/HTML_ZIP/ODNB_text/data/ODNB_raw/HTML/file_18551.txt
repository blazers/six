<span class="headword">Melville,  Robert</span>  (1723&#150;1809), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Monimail, Fife, on 5 October 1723, the son of the Revd Andrew Melvil (<i>d</i>. 1736), the minister of Monimail, and his wife, Helen, daughter of Robert Whytt or White, an advocate. His younger brother was the natural philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18542/', "Thomas Melvill (1726&#150;1753)")</script>. Through both maternal and paternal lines Melville was descended from a cadet branch of the family headed by the earls of Leven and Melville. Owing to the early death of both parents, his education was entrusted to a maternal uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29345/', "Dr Robert Whytt (1714&#150;1766)")</script>, a professor of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Educated at Leven grammar school, Melville matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1737, continued his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh, but left university without graduating to follow a military career.<br>
<br>Commissioned an ensign in the 25th regiment of foot in March 1744, Melville served in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession, from 1744 to 1748. Present at Fontenoy (April 1745) he returned with the regiment to Scotland during the Jacobite rising. Part of the garrison of Blair Castle, Perthshire, he may have been present at Culloden (April 1746). Having returned to Flanders, he was present at Rocoux (September 1746) and at Laffeldt (June 1747). At the latter battle his conduct won him promotion to lieutenant. Following the war he served in Ireland from 1749 to 1755 and was promoted to captain in August 1751. He then returned to Scotland to recruit for the regiment. Appointed an aide-de-camp to William Maule, earl of Panmure, he was promoted to major of the 38th regiment of foot, then stationed in Antigua, in January 1756.<br>
<br>During the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63) Melville's service was limited to the West Indies. Between January and May 1759 he commanded the light infantry during the reduction of Guadeloupe. Appointed the lieutenant-governor of the island, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in June 1759; following the death of Brigadier Bryan Crump in February 1761 he was appointed temporary governor of Guadeloupe. He took part in the capture of Dominica by Andrew, fifth Lord Rollo, and having been promoted to brigadier in September 1761, he commanded a division in General Robert Monckton's reduction of Martinique in February 1762.<br>
<br>During these amphibious campaigns Melville continued the studies in ordnance and shell delivery that he had begun while at Blair Castle. By 1759, at the earliest, he had developed a naval gun carriage without trunnions that could mount a new type of naval gun which he had invented. A short seven-calibre weapon, the gun delivered a slow-moving, heavy shot which upon impact with timber caused a large irregular hole and massive splintering. Initially nicknamed &#145;the smasher&#146;, the weapon was finally put into production at the Carron Iron Works, Falkirk, in 1779, and was renamed the carronade. Although the larger version, the melvillade, was rarely used, the carronade became one of the most important innovations in naval warfare in the second part of the eighteenth century. The gun, whose elevation and angle of fire were governed by a screw on its gun carriage, suited the British style of close-in fighting and by 1781 over 600 guns had been mounted by the Royal Navy. The carronade proved decisive in Admiral Rodney's victory over the French at the battle of the Saints on 12 April 1782.<br>
<br>Melville returned to Britain in September 1762, and following the treaty of Paris (1763) his appointment as the new governor of the Ceded Islands (Grenada, the Grenadines, Tobago, Dominica and St Vincent) was announced in July that year. He arrived at his administrative capital, Port Royal, Grenada, in December 1764, and his seven-year governorship was largely successful. Regional economic growth was generated largely by the concentration of land into bigger plantations and the increased importance of African slaves to work them: over 10,000 between 1746 and 1764 alone. He was promoted to major-general in August 1766. Regional prosperity was reflected in Melville's own rising wealth: in 1770 his island properties were estimated to value &pound;45,000&#151;including a large plantation, Melville Hall, on Grenada and another, Carnbee, on Tobago. Like most colonial governors in America, however, Melville experienced problems with his regional assemblies. Transplanted British planters especially opposed Melville's policy of allowing the French Catholic landowning subjects the vote and a share in administration. Recalled in 1768 to defend his actions, Melville's presence in London generated a pamphlet exchange and hostile comments in the opposition press, especially the <span class="italic">Political Register</span>. Melville's policies were supported by the imperial government and were later implemented on Grenada by his lieutenant-governor, Ulysses Fitzmaurice, in 1769.<br>
<br>Melville resigned his commission as governor in July 1771 and between 1774 and 1776 he travelled extensively in Europe, pursuing his interest in Roman history. He visited many important sites of antiquity and suggested an alternative route for Hannibal's crossing of the Alps to that favoured by historians of the day. With the outbreak of the American War of Independence he returned to Britain and was promoted to lieutenant-general in August 1777, but took no active part in the war itself. When Tobago was ceded to France at the end of the conflict, Melville undertook a successful diplomatic mission to Paris in 1783 to protect the property rights of the British subjects remaining on the island.<br>
<br>A prominent freemason and an energetic supporter of the Scots Corporation in London as well as other Scottish charities, Melville was a member of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries of London, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Edinburgh, he was, despite being totally blind in later life, advanced to full general in October 1793. At the time of his death at his house in George Street, New Town, Edinburgh, on 29 August 1809, he was the second oldest general in the British army. A bachelor, Melville left his property, including an estate at Strathkinness, Fife, to his cousin John Whyte, son of Robert Whytt, his mother's brother, who had taken the name Melville in 1797.<br>
