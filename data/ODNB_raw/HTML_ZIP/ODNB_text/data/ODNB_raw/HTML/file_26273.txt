<span class="headword">Stanley,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1465&#150;1515), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, was the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26279/', "Thomas Stanley, first earl of Derby (d. 1504)")</script>, and his first wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. in or before 1471), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19954/', "Richard Neville, fifth earl of Salisbury")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26261/', "Edward Stanley, first Baron Monteagle (d. 1523)")</script>, was his brother. Although it has been claimed that James Stanley was educated at both Oxford and Cambridge, there is no evidence that he was ever at Cambridge. He was MA of Oxford by 1481, however, when he was acting as tutor to Edward de la Pole, son of the duke of Suffolk, and the same university granted him the degree of DCnL on 18 June 1506. He has sometimes been confused with his uncle, another James Stanley, who preceded him at Oxford, and also as the warden of the collegiate church of Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1471 Stanley received a papal dispensation to hold a major cathedral or collegiate dignity as soon as he was fourteen years of age. He was canon of Southwell, with the prebend of Dunham, 1479&#150;85, rector of Eccleston, Lancashire, 1482&#150;5, and precentor of Salisbury, 1485&#150;1506. On 20 September 1485 he was also made dean of St Martin's-le-Grand, London, for life by royal grant, probably through the influence of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1863/', "Lady Margaret Beaufort")</script>, his father's second wife and mother of Henry VII. In the same year he succeeded his uncle as warden of Manchester collegiate church, a position he held until 1509. During his wardenship, the buildings were considerably extended. He held numerous benefices and offices during the 1480s and 1490s. He was rector of Hawarden, Flintshire, 1486&#150;1505; canon of Salisbury, with the prebends successively of Yetminster Prima, 1492&#150;3, and Beaminster Prima, 1493&#150;1506; canon of Ripon and prebendary of Givendale and Shelton, 1493&#150;8; rector of Winwick, Lancashire, 1494&#150;1515; and rector of Rotharne, Cheshire, 1498&#150;1515. The last two benefices were united by papal dispensation on condition of cure of souls being provided, and Stanley was subsequently granted leave to retain these parishes after becoming a bishop. In June 1492 Stanley was granted a dispensation to study at Oxford, although he held a benefice with the cure of souls. He is said to have been at Paris in 1496, but the story that he was rejected as a student by Erasmus is incorrect, being based entirely on a dubious supposition by Erasmus's eighteenth-century biographer, Samuel Knight. On 19 November 1500 Stanley was made archdeacon of Richmond, a position he held without distinction. Finally, on 18 July 1506, he was appointed bishop of Ely by papal provision, the temporalities being restored on 5 November.<br>
<br>There can be no doubt that Stanley owed his advancement in the church to the influence of his father, and above all to that of his stepmother. As soon as he was appointed to Ely he consulted with Lady Margaret over the choice of a successor to Manchester; and once established as bishop he was closely involved in her patronage of Cambridge University. Like her he was generous in his support of Jesus College, endowing a fellowship in 1506, and later (in 1514&#150;15) issuing statutes. He also participated in Lady Margaret's foundation of colleges. In the case of Christ's College, founded in 1506, Stanley's principal contribution lay in his exemption of the new foundation from episcopal visitation. In the case of St John's College, however, although in 1508&#150;9 he gave his formal consent to the conversion of St John's Hospital into a college, and transferred to his stepmother his own position as patron of the hospital, he was also careful to safeguard the rights both of his see and of the hospital's remaining brethren. Furthermore, he improved the episcopal residence at Somersham, Huntingdonshire, where he spent his summers, while wintering with his brother in Derbyshire. Stanley died at Manchester on 22 March 1515, having probably been suddenly taken ill, since he made his will just two days earlier. He was buried in the Ely chapel in the collegiate church, for the building of which he left &pound;100 in his will, and where he is commemorated by a brass showing him in episcopal robes.<br>
<br>Stanley's life and reputation epitomized all that later reformers despised in the pre-Reformation clergy, though in fact he was hardly typical of the early Tudor bench. He was a pluralist, incontinent, and generally absent, and Godwin's sour appraisal of him as &#145;so drowned in pleasures he passed his time without doing any one thing worthy commendation or remembrance&#146;  (Godwin, 223&#150;4) is only reinforced by the lines found in the family poem that although a priest, &#145;yet little priest's mettle was in him, by Christ&#146;  (Hibbert-Ware, 51). He was apparently fond of cock-fighting; and a liaison with his housekeeper at Somersham produced at least two sons, John and Thomas, and a daughter, Margaret, who married Sir Henry Halsall of Halsall. The elder son, John, fought at Flodden Field on 9 September 1513, was knighted, and founded the family of Stanleys of Hanford, Cheshire.<br>
