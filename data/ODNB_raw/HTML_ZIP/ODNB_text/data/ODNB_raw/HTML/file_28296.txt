<span class="headword">Villiers,  Sarah Sophia  Child-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Sarah Sophia Fane]</span>, countess of Jersey  (1785&#150;1867), <span class="occ">political hostess</span>, was born on 4 March 1785, the second child and eldest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9136/', "John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland (1759&#150;1841)")</script>, and his first wife, Sarah Anne (1764&#150;1793), daughter and sole heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53661/', "Robert Child")</script> of Osterley Park, Middlesex. Under the terms of her grandfather's will Lady Sarah was the heir to the great Child's Bank fortune, which brought her an income estimated at some &pound;60,000 a year, and Osterley Park, Middlesex. The immensity of her fortune influenced her character: one less well-endowed young woman found her frightening: &#145;she is so completely a <i>maitresse femme</i> (very naturally, from her immense fortune which always made her superior to everybody she ever lived among) that I feel overpowered by her somehow&#146;  (Wyndham, 34&#150;5). Lady Sarah was inevitably much sought after as a bride: Lady Harriet Cavendish observed three suitors (Lord Villiers, Tom Sheridan, and Lord Granville Leveson-Gower) at one house party alone. &#145;Perhaps&#146;, opined Lady Harriet, &#145;they would not object to sharing her affections, but I doubt whether the division of the rest of their acquisition would be borne as quietly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hary-O</span>, 66). It was George Villiers, Lord Villiers [<a name="cosubject_28296"></a><span class="headword">George  Child-Villiers</span>, fifth earl of Jersey  (1773&#150;1859)<span class="occ"></span>], who caught the heiress; she married him in London on 23 May 1804.<br>
<br>Villiers, who was born on 19 August 1773, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28295/', "George Bussy Villiers, fourth earl of Jersey (1735&#150;1805)")</script>, and his notorious wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63969/', "Frances Villiers (1753&#150;1821)")</script>, daughter of Philip Twysden, bishop of Raphoe, and mistress of the prince of Wales. Educated at Harrow School and St John's College, Cambridge, he succeeded as fifth earl of Jersey the year after his marriage, and took the additional surname Child in 1812. Jersey had nothing of the flamboyance of his wife, and he accepted her activities with complacency. He was a keen foxhunter: Nimrod, in his <span class="italic">Crack Riders of England</span>, referred to him as &#145;not only one of the hardest, boldest, and most judicious, but perhaps the most elegant rider to hounds the world ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was also a dedicated supporter of horse racing, breeding and training his own horses at Middleton Park, Oxfordshire: among his successes were Cobweb, who won the Oaks in 1824, and three Derby winners: Middleton (1825), Mameluke (1827), and Bay Middleton (1836). He played no active part in politics, but served as lord chamberlain to William IV in the Wellington and Peel ministries of 1830 and 1834&#150;5, and as master of the horse to Queen Victoria, under Peel in 1841&#150;6 and Derby in 1852.<br>
<br>After some anxiety about her failure to become pregnant early in her marriage, Lady Jersey bore eight children, one of whom died in infancy. But childbearing interfered little with her career as one of the most prominent hostesses and social figures of her generation. She entertained in London at 38 Berkeley Square, at Osterley, and at Middleton, and her houses became centres for the whig party. With her friends, enemies, rivals, and almost exact contemporaries Emily, Lady Cowper and the Russian ambassadress, Princess Lieven, she was one of the lady patronesses of the exclusive Almack's club at Willis's Rooms, and as such exerted huge social influence. Dark-haired and attractive, her volubility was such that she earned the nickname &#145;Silence&#146; and the ridicule of her detractors, and exhausted even her friends: Lady Granville found her &#145;remarkably amiable from being more silent than usual&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hary-O</span>, 127). Creevey compared her to a mechanical musical bird:<blockquote>She begins to sing at eleven o'clock, and, with the interval of the hour she retires to her cage to rest, she sings till 12 at night without a moment's interruption. &hellip; Of the <i>merits</i> of her songs I say nothing until we meet. (Maxwell, 296)</blockquote>More disturbing to the comfort of her friends, however, was her habit of self-dramatization, of excesses of romantic feeling and sensibility, and her perpetual enjoyment of the role of tragedy queen. This romanticism prompted Lady Jersey to become a supporter of Byron during his troubles in 1814&#150;15, and she offered him a refuge at Middleton.<br>
<br>Like many women of her class and generation Lady Jersey had pronounced political views and did not hesitate to express them, and for some years she was an important whig. Brougham commented in 1816 that &#145;Lady Jersey's absence is very bad for the party. &hellip; Her great influence in society was always honestly and heartily exerted with her usual excellence of disposition&#146;  (Maxwell, 259&#150;60). Her love of being at the centre of attention, perhaps, as much as conviction led her to take up the unfashionable cause of Queen Caroline when George IV was seeking to divorce her: she championed the queen with such frenzied fervour that her friends began to doubt her reason. By the end of the 1820s, however, Sarah Jersey had aligned herself with the tories: Wellington and Peel became her great heroes, and in the 1830s and 1840s her parties were held on behalf of the opponents of reform. She fancied herself the confidante of the duke&#151;who mistrusted her discretion, and was once heard to mutter &#145;What damned nonsense Lady Jersey talks!&#146;  (ibid., 574)&#151;and her family was linked to Peel's by the marriage of her eldest son to Peel's daughter. Her influence waned considerably in the 1840s, when new faces, such as the duchess of Sutherland, supplanted the older woman, and the marriage of her rival Lady Cowper to Lord Palmerston in 1839 cast her into the shade as a political hostess.<br>
<br>There was more to Sarah Jersey than the society hostess. Somewhat incongruously, she was the owner and senior partner of Child's Bank, and kept a desk in the office. She was an active partner, and did not delegate her responsibilities to her husband or other men. She also took great interest in the people who lived on the Jersey estates, especially in Oxfordshire, and set up and financed a number of schools for the benefit of the tenants and labourers. As her own children grew up, they were a source of mixed anxiety and pride. The eldest surviving son was in poor health, and his wife was notoriously unfaithful; the second son died in 1837, and the fourth, Francis, was a wastrel whose early death in 1862 was perhaps a mercy. Lady Jersey arranged an ambitious match for her eldest daughter, Lady Sarah Villiers, with the Austrian Prince Nicholas Esterh&aacute;zy. Although the engagement was announced in 1836, the wedding did not happen until 1842, as the Esterh&aacute;zys sought to extricate themselves from a match that (to the status-conscious Austrians) was tainted by associations with trade. The princess died in 1853. The second daughter, Lady Clementina, who was a constant companion to her mother and well known in society, died unmarried in 1858, and the third daughter, Lady Adela, died in 1860, having scandalized her family by eloping with a Captain Ibbetson.<br>
<br>Lord Jersey died at 38 Berkeley Square, London, on 3 October 1859 and was buried at Middleton Stoney. Three weeks later he was followed to the grave by his eldest son, whose own son succeeded as seventh earl of Jersey. Sarah Jersey disdained the excesses of Victorian mourning and continued to entertain, receiving visitors every evening into the 1860s. Her sister-in-law, Lady Westmorland, described her in 1863 as &#145;still brilliant, talkative, gay, and beautiful, always dressed in the latest fashion in sky blue or rose colour, with flowers in her (own) hair, which is not grey. &hellip; She has kept her sight, hearing, and memory, without any change&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Priscilla, Countess of Westmorland</span>, 445). After a decline of a few weeks Sarah, Lady Jersey died on 26 January 1867 at 38 Berkeley Square, and was buried at Middleton Stoney. Her will aroused some curiosity, but it was uncontroversial. Most of the property went to the seventh earl, with generous provision made for her other grandchildren. Henry Greville considered that<blockquote>It was her great zest and gaiety, rather than her cleverness, which constituted her power of attracting remarkable men, many of whom I have seen listen with the greatest complacency to what they would have considered to be egregious nonsense had it emanated from less charming lips. (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Greville</span>, 4.309&#150;10, 4 Feb 1867)</blockquote>Lady Jersey's foibles lent themselves to caricature, and she featured in Disraeli's novels as Zenobia and Lady St Julians, and as Lady Augusta in Lady Caroline Lamb's <span class="italic">Glenarvon</span>. In her youth she was a beauty and much painted. Mrs Mee included her among her series of miniatures of court beauties for the prince regent in 1814, but he rejected it; Byron wrote her a &#145;condolatory address&#146; on the occasion.<br>
