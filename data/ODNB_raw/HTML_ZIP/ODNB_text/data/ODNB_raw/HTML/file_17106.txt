<span class="headword">Lowth,  William</span>  (1661&#150;1732), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born in the parish of St Martin Ludgate, London, at 4 p.m. on 11 September 1661 and baptized there at 5 p.m. on 1 October, the son of William Lowth, apothecary, and his wife, Mary Short. His father, who was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17105/', "Simon Lowth (bap. 1636, d. 1720)")</script>, was &#145;burnt out with great loss at the fire of London&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 57/2, 1787, 1028). At the time of the great fire, Lowth was receiving a preparatory education under his grandfather Simon Lowth (1600&#150;1679), rector of Tilehurst, Berkshire. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School on 11 September 1672 and was elected scholar of St John's College, Oxford, on 11 June 1675. He became a fellow and graduated BA in 1679, proceeding MA (1683) and BD (1688). On 25 May 1684 he was ordained deacon at Christ Church, Oxford; he was made a priest on 20 September 1685, subsequently becoming vicar of St Nicholas, Rochester, and rector of Overton, Hampshire.<br>
<br>In 1692 Lowth published <span class="italic">A vindication of the divine authority and inspiration of the writings of the Old and New Testament</span>, in which he attacked Hobbes, Spinoza, and other critics of the integrity and inspiration of scripture and answered many of the points raised by Jean Le Clerc's <span class="italic">Five Letters</span> (1690). Lowth defended the Oratorian Richard Simon from some of Le Clerc's remarks and from the misrepresentation of his ideas given in the poem <span class="italic">Religio laici</span> by John Dryden. This work found favour with Peter Mew, bishop of Winchester, who made him his chaplain, gave him a prebendal stall at Winchester on 8 October 1696, and presented him to the benefice of Buriton with Petersfield, Hampshire, in May 1699, which he held until his death. In 1697 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidency of St John's College, Oxford. A second edition of the <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, with a new preface in which Lowth defended the authority of the Pauline epistles against some remarks of John Locke, appeared in 1699. On 15 November 1700 he married, at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, Margaret, daughter of Robert Pitt of Blandford Forum, Dorset.<br>
<br>In 1708 Lowth printed <span class="italic">Directions for the Profitable Reading of the Holy Scriptures</span>; six editions of this book had been published by 1799. It aimed to serve as a practical guide for lay readers to safe and profitable texts in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His skill as an expositor, whose work appealed to lay people as well as divines, was confirmed by the success of a series of commentaries on the prophetic books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> that he published between 1714 and 1726. These were frequently reprinted later in the century as a companion to the commentaries of Simon Patrick on the historical books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. Lowth effectively summarized the most advanced orthodox ideas of post-Restoration churchmen in his commentaries, which treated Israelite prophecy as foreshadowing the teaching of Christ and the history of the church. A dedicated advocate of the established church, Lowth preached against separation in June 1722 following the opening of a dissenting meeting-house at Petersfield. In his sermon, and in the ensuing pamphlet controversy with John Norman, Lowth defended the apostolical institution of episcopacy and the record of the Church of England in promoting knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was, however, a somewhat reluctant controversialist and he withdrew from lengthy engagement with Norman, sending his adversary manuscript responses that he refused to allow to be printed. He was highly regarded as a critic by his contemporaries and assisted John Potter in an edition of Clement of Alexandria and John Hudson with his work on Josephus. He also contributed to William Reading's edition of early ecclesiastical historians and advised Edward Chandler in his controversy with Anthony Collins. Lowth died at Buriton on 17 May 1732 and was buried in the churchyard there. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and three daughters.<br>
