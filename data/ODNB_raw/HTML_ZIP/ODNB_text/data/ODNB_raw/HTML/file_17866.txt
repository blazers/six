<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Malcolm,  Sarah</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1733), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born in Durham but the family moved to Dublin. On the death of her mother, Malcolm migrated to London, becoming a domestic servant at the Temple. One of her employers was an elderly widow, Lydia Duncomb, who lived with another old woman and their maid. On 5 February 1733 the papers reported a grisly murder of the three women, found in their beds with their throats cut from ear to ear. Four servants were arrested and Sarah Malcolm was later named as the prime suspect. Examined by the magistrate, Sir Richard Brocas, she confessed that &#145;she, Mary Tracy, together with James and Thomas Alexander, both Brothers, had for some time contrived to rob the Chambers of Mrs Duncomb&#146;, saying that they had sneaked into the apartment, accidentally waking the servant and having to murder the women. The evidence produced was &#145;A Silver Tankard, a bloody Apron and Shift found in a Close-Stool, and Bundles of Cloaths, in her Master's Chambers, where she hid them, and 45 Guineas, concealed in her Hair&#146;  (Paulson, <span class="italic">Hogarth</span>, 2.7).<br>
<br>She was remanded to Newgate and the inquest subsequently brought in a verdict of wilful murder against Malcolm only, refusing to accept her story about the accomplices. She probably expected either to turn king's evidence and get herself off or at worst admit theft while denying murder. Both were capital offences, but the former frequently resulted in transportation rather than the death sentence. At her trial on 23 February she pleaded not guilty and put up a spirited defence, arguing that the blood found on her garments was her own menstrual blood and not that of the murdered women. After her sentence she continued to deny the murder, simultaneously declaring that she was a Roman Catholic and behaving &#145;very penitent and devout&#146;. Her case was unusual given the scandal of her defence, her alleged Catholicism, and above all her refusal to confess, since confession and penance in the face of death were usual at the time.<br>
<br>As Ronald Paulson suggests, it may well have been the mix of Malcolm's bloody crime and youth, gender, and cool behaviour after the murders that attracted William Hogarth to paint her portrait. Accompanied by his father-in-law, Sir James Thornhill, Hogarth visited her cell and &#145;took down a very exact Likeness&#146; of Malcolm, which was subsequently published as an engraving. Hogarth is said to have remarked, &#145;I see by this woman's features that she is capable of any wickedness&#146;, but on what grounds he based this conclusion is open to speculation. Her execution two days later on 7 March was almost as melodramatic as her performance in court and prison. She went to the gibbet dressed in a black gown and black gloves, appearing &#145;very serious and devout, crying and wringing her Hands in an extraordinary manner&#146;  (Paulson, <span class="italic">Hogarth</span>, 2.9&#150;10). Several platforms constructed for the crowds collapsed and a number of spectators were injured. Malcolm's trial and execution reveal the continuing fascination with the idea of women and evil, though it is unlikely that she would have been remembered if Hogarth had not used her as a subject for one of his &#145;low life&#146; works.<br>
