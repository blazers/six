<span class="headword">Ramsay,  George</span>, twelfth earl of Dalhousie  (1806&#150;1880), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of John (1775&#150;1842), the fourth son of George Ramsay, eighth earl of Dalhousie, was born on 26 April 1806. His mother was Mary (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of Philip Delisle of Calcutta. He entered the navy in December 1820 and served in the frigates <i>Cambrian</i> and <i>Euryalus</i> in the Mediterranean, and on the South American station in the <i>Doris</i>, from which, on 30 April 1827, he was promoted to be lieutenant of the <i>Heron</i>. He afterwards served in the <i>Ganges</i>, the flagship of Sir Robert Otway, at Rio de Janeiro, and in the <i>Orestes</i> on the coast of Ireland; his three years as first lieutenant of the <i>Nimrod</i> on the Lisbon station was followed by a period in the <i>Rodney</i> in the Mediterranean from November 1835 until his promotion to the rank of commander on 10 January 1837. From August 1838 to August 1842 he commanded the <i>Pilot</i> in the West Indies and on 20 March 1843 he was advanced to post rank. He married Sarah Frances (<i>d</i>. 1904), only daughter of William Robertson of Logan House, Midlothian, on 12 August 1845.<br>
<br>From August 1849 to the end of 1852 Ramsay commanded the <i>Alarm</i> (26 guns) on the North American and West Indian stations. In December 1853 he commissioned the <i>Euryalus</i>, a new screw frigate, then considered one of the finest ships in the navy, and during the two following years he commanded her in the Baltic. On 4 February 1856 he was nominated a CB, and on the conclusion of peace with Russia was sent, still in the <i>Euryalus</i>, to the West Indies, whence he returned in the spring of 1857. He was then appointed superintendent of Pembroke dockyard, where he continued until September 1862. On 22 November 1862 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and from 1866 to 1869, with the <i>Narcissus</i> as his flagship, he was commander-in-chief on the east coast of South America. He became vice-admiral on 17 March 1869 and admiral, on the retired list, on 20 July 1875. On 6 July 1874, on the death without issue of his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18365/', "Fox Maule, eleventh earl of Dalhousie")</script>, he succeeded to the title. On 12 June 1875 he was also created Baron Ramsay in the peerage of the United Kingdom as a reward for his naval service and his tory principles. He died suddenly at his home, Dalhousie Castle, Midlothian, on 20 July 1880.<br>
<br>Dalhousie's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_23093"></a><span class="headword">John William Maule Ramsay</span>, thirteenth earl of Dalhousie  (1847&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span>, followed his father into the navy in January 1861 and, having passed his examination with unusual brilliance, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 12 April 1867. He was then appointed flag-lieutenant to his father in the <i>Narcissus</i>, but it is doubtful if he ever joined her, being lent to the <i>Galatea</i>, then commanded by Alfred, duke of Edinburgh, with whom he remained until the ship was paid off in the summer of 1871. In September 1872 he joined the <i>Lord Warden</i> as flag-lieutenant of Sir Hastings Yelverton, the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, and, on Yelverton's striking his flag, he was promoted commander on 4 March 1874. For the next three years he was equerry to the duke of Edinburgh, and in October 1875 he matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, where he spent some months as an undergraduate. From April 1877 to August 1879 he was commander of the <i>Britannia</i> training ship of naval cadets. After this he virtually retired from the navy, and devoted himself to study and politics. He married Lady Ida Louisa Bennet (1857&#150;1887), daughter of the sixth earl of Tankerville and his wife, Olivia, in December 1877; she was also active in political society.<br>
<br>In February 1880 Ramsay was a candidate for Liverpool in a by-election, as an advanced Liberal and a follower of Gladstone; he was defeated mainly, it was said, by the influence of his father, who was a staunch Conservative. In the general election of 1880 he was returned as the minority member for Liverpool unopposed with two Conservatives, but on his father's death on 20 July that year was called to the House of Lords. In September he was appointed one of Queen Victoria's lords-in-waiting and he was nominated a knight of the Thistle in November 1881. In January 1883 he spent some weeks in Ireland as one of a royal commission to inquire into the state of the country, and came back, in his own words, &#145;even more impressed than I was before I went with the serious state of discontent, quite apart from outrages, which seems to pervade all Ireland out of Ulster&#146;. This impression led him&#151;in contrast to the timidity of many of his colleagues in the Lords&#151;to support Gladstone's home-rule policy in 1886, and in March he joined the Liberal ministry as secretary for Scotland in succession to G. O. Trevelyan; he resigned with his colleagues in July. He was sworn of the privy council in April 1886.<br>
<br>In 1887 Dalhousie and his wife made an extensive tour of the United States. They arrived at Le Havre in poor health on their return voyage in November. On the 24th the countess's illness proved fatal, and Dalhousie, unable to bear the shock, died in Le Havre the next morning. The bodies were buried in the family vault in Cockpen parish church, Midlothian. They left two sons, the elder of whom, Arthur George Maule Ramsay, succeeded to the title.<br>
