<span class="headword">Hays,  Mary</span>  (1759&#150;1843), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 4 May 1759 in Southwark, London, the daughter of John and Elizabeth Hays, rational dissenters living at 5 Gainsford Street, Southwark, and worshipping at Blacksfields Particular Baptist Chapel on the corner of the street. Her father was a mariner in the merchant fleet and died in or before 1774 when his daughter Sarah married. Mary's siblings included Sarah, Joanna, Elizabeth, John, and &#145;little Tommy&#146;. The death of her father was the first in a series of &#145;blows&#146; which encouraged a deep belief in determinism which was to influence Mary's mature life. As a very young woman she cherished &#145;exquisite sensibility&#146;  (Hays to Godwin, 7 Dec 1794) and exhibited a habitual melancholy. In 1778, while living with her widowed mother and two unmarried sisters at Gainsford Street, Southwark, she began a correspondence with John Eccles, and after much opposition from both families, it was agreed that the two could marry. Eccles died weeks before the ceremony, however, and she never fully recovered from the shock.<br>
<br>Despite an &#145;irascible&#146; temper and a persistent belief that &#145;much of misery has been my portion&#146;  (Hays to Godwin, undated), Hays gained some solace in her religion under the tutelage of Robert Robinson and may have attended the newly established dissenting academy at Hackney. The attack by Gilbert Wakefield there on public worship roused her to produce a pamphlet in its defence, <span class="italic">Cursory Remarks on an Enquiry into the Expediency and Propriety of Public Worship</span> (1792), under the pseudonym Eusebia. The pamphlet was widely acclaimed and a second edition produced. Its success precipitated her acceptance into the radical circle surrounding the publisher Joseph Johnson, which included William Blake, Thomas Paine, and William Godwin. The following year she published <span class="italic">Letters and Essays, Moral and Miscellaneous</span>.<br>
<br>Hays wrote articles for the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> during 1796 and 1797, joining in debates about the female intellect and, under the influence of Claude-Adrien Helv&eacute;tius, insisting on the recognition of environmental and educational influences. She felt that this sensationalism legitimated the passions within rational philosophy which she claimed was &#145;impotent &hellip; against reiterated feeling&#146;  (Hays to Godwin, 13 Oct 1795). In 1794&#150;1800 she engaged in a correspondence with the radical William Godwin, who had taken over the educative role vacated by Eccles. Her initial encouragement led to his marriage to her friend Mary Wollstonecraft. The lengthy correspondence between Hays and Godwin displays initial acquiescence and reverence on Hays's part developing into antagonism and later attack on his uncompromisingly rational philosophy. Hays argued instead for an alternative, intuitive logic based on experience which she felt was more appropriate to daily life. As she said, &#145;how much further &hellip; does a little nature go than mere philosophy&#146;  (Hays to Godwin, 29 April 1796). The correspondence ended abruptly with the death of Wollstonecraft after Godwin refused Hays admittance to the deathbed and she refused to attend the Anglican funeral service.<br>
<br>Hays had also met and won approval from leading dissenters such as George Dyer, Joseph Priestley, John Disney, and William Frend. She was a worshipper at Salters' Hall and Essex Street Chapel, and was invited to Priestley's farewell gathering before his exile to America in 1794. Through dissent Hays found a &#145;voice&#146; to articulate her concerns and so contribute to its platform of discussion and controversy. At William Frend's instigation, she formed a close but unresolved relationship with him. According to Henry Crabb Robinson her feelings were reciprocated but Frend claimed to lack the means to support a wife. Their relationship formed the substance of her scandalous first novel <span class="italic">Memoirs of Emma Courtney</span> (1796). It is unapologetically autobiographical and her frankness about her fictionalized feelings for Frend won her notoriety, despite the preface's insistence that it was &#145;calculated to operate as a <i>warning</i>, rather than as an example&#146;. Her second novel, <span class="italic">The Victim of Prejudice</span>, was published in 1799 and, according to the &#145;Advertisement&#146;, delineates &#145;the mischiefs that have ensued from the too great stress laid on the reputation for chastity in women&#146;. She continued to write, producing among other works books for children and an acclaimed <span class="italic">Female Biography, or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women of All Ages and Countries</span> (6 vols., 1802). Her most radical work was the <span class="italic">Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in behalf of Women</span> (1798), in which she argued that there were no scriptural or rational arguments to justify the continued subjection of women. It was written at the same time as Wollstonecraft's much more celebrated <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span>, though not published until six years later, and echoes many of Wollstonecraft's views on the position of women in society. In particular, Hays joins Wollstonecraft in advising women to throw off their shackles by educating themselves rationally so that they realize their potential as the intellectual equals of men. Hays argued consistently against the disadvantages built into female education and especially against the damaging effects of &#145;sexual distinctions&#146;  (Hays to Godwin, 21 Nov 1795). Her forthright depictions of female passion made her a target for satire, most notably as Bridgetina Botherim in <span class="italic">Memoirs of Modern Philosophers</span> (1800&#150;01) by Elizabeth Hamilton, and as Lady Gertrude Sinclair in <span class="italic">Edmund Oliver</span> (1798) by Charles Lloyd.<br>
<br>Hays never married, but had a varied circle of male and female friends. She had a long friendship with the novelist Eliza Fenwick and was considered &#145;Mamma&#146; to Fenwick's son Orlando. Fenwick invited her to help run a school in Barbados in 1813 and in America in 1821. Despite her wish to become accepted within rational circles she insisted on the acceptance of &#145;the affections&#146; and may have been instrumental in Godwin's revisions of his writings. Towards the end of her life she confessed to Henry Crabb Robinson that &#145;I have done with systems. I am a complete and an indifferent skeptic&#146;  (Hays to Henry Crabb Robinson, 27 Feb 1802, DWL). Her &#145;exquisite misery&#146; and longevity were ironic comments on her search for happiness and frequent wishes to be dead  (Hays to Godwin, 6 Feb 1796). She died in Lower Clapton on 20 February 1843 and was buried in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, on 25 February. Although she would not have approved of the Anglican service she would have been pleased at Henry Crabb Robinson's observation that the rest of the afternoon was spent in controversial conversation.<br>
