<span class="headword">King,  James</span>, Lord Eythin  (1589&#150;1652), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the son of David King of Warbester in Orkney and his wife, Mary, daughter of Adam Stewart, Carthusian prior of Perth and illegitimate son of James V.<h2>
<a name="Swedishservice"></a>Swedish service</h2>King entered Swedish service at the age of twenty, and was eventually joined by his brothers David (who rose to the rank of major) and John King of Warbester and his cousin James King of the Barra family, who became a colonel. Little is known of the first ten years of his service; by 1619 he was serving in the Sm&aring;land regiment commanded by his fellow Scot Alexander Leslie. King was eventually promoted and in 1622 served as a captain in the Scottish regiment of Patrick Ruthven, the future earl of Forth and of Brentford and lord general of Charles I's armies during the early years of the civil war. About 1623 King had his portrait painted directly onto the wall of Skokloster Castle, where it survives.<br>
<br>In 1624 King became a major in Otto von Scheiding's regiment. From 1626 to 1630 he was back with the Scottish regiments, where he served as lieutenant-colonel to David Drummond and Patrick Ruthven, but he did not stay with his countrymen for long. The Scottish military diarist Robert Monro listed King as general-major and colonel of the Dutch cavalry and infantry in service by 1632. Following the death of Gustavus Adolphus in November, King departed from purely military affairs when he was appointed governor of Vlotho, a garrison town on the banks of the Weser. The following year, while stationed as a colonel in the city of Thuw in the bishopric of Bremen, he joined the German political and literary society <i>Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft</i> (the Fruitful Society) under the name of <i>Der Verbleibende</i> (the one who remains). King had married a Pomeranian woman, Dilliana Van der Borchens. She probably died in 1634; her will was proved on 10 November of that year.<br>
<br>King continued as a prominent field commander. In 1636 he was lieutenant-general in Leslie's army in Westphalia. The following year he joined forces with the landgrave of Hesse in his attempts to push the imperial forces out of his territories; initial success turned into a forced retreat into Westphalia, and when the landgrave broke up his army King was forced to withdraw his small command into garrisons. In 1638 he was ordered by Marshal Johan Ban&eacute;r to join his army, then at M&uuml;nster, with that of Charles Lewis, the elector palatine, and his brother Prince Rupert, the nephews of Charles I. The combined forces were decisively defeated at the battle of Lemgo (also known as the battle of Vlotho), near Minden in October; Rupert was captured. King was credited with orchestrating the orderly withdrawal of the only part of the army not to be routed. He managed to evade both capture and serious injury, and received a Swedish knighthood for his services. Recriminations over Lemgo were to poison relations between King and Prince Rupert at a crucial juncture for the royalist cause six years later.<h2>
<a name="CharlesIsagent"></a>Charles I's agent</h2>News of the troubled situation in Scotland led King to retire from Swedish service. He explained to the Swedish Riksr&aring;d that he did not wish to serve in the Swedish army without his former field commander, Alexander Leslie, who had returned to Scotland to uphold the covenant. King sought, as did many Scottish officers, compensation for the wage arrears due to him. The Riksr&aring;d agreed that in view of his twenty-six years' service to the Swedish crown he should receive the outstanding money and a pension of 1200 riksdaler. They also argued that this gesture would ensure the continued support of the Scots for Sweden and its designs against Denmark&#150;Norway and the Habsburg empire&#151;suggesting that they saw King as sympathetic to his native country at this time of conflict between Scotland and its king. After all, the Scottish covenanters were pressing a protestant ideal far closer to King's heart than the ecclesiastical reforms pressed by Charles I.<br>
<br>On leaving Sweden King took up residence in Hamburg, choosing to sit out the war there rather than return to Britain to fight against his old commander Leslie. He certainly helped the king's cause there, even if the degree to which he wished for a Scottish defeat is uncertain. On 28 June 1639 he signed a testimonial with his kinsman Colonel James King confirming that arms bought by Sir Thomas Roe were serviceable and fit for the king's service: in fact they were found to be in such poor condition that they had to be returned to Hamburg.<br>
<br>King returned briefly to Britain and was awarded a pension of &pound;1000 per annum by Charles I. He was soon dispatched back to Hamburg with orders to build up an army of trained officers and soldiers that he was expected to lead home against the covenanters. Rumours circulated that the English lord treasurer had been instructed to issue King with &pound;50,000 to purchase arms from Christian IV of Denmark&#150;Norway, but apparently no merchant could be found to make up this money. Undaunted by his lack of funds, King pressured Christian to provide 3000 Danish cavalry for use against the covenanters: his attempts were ultimately unavailing, though Christian did order that horses intended for Spanish service be diverted to England.<br>
<br>Christian declared his willingness to help Charles but asked for a written proposal for the transfer of the Orkney and Shetland islands to the Danish crown as the price of his assistance to the Stuart crown. King demurred: putting the business in writing would threaten its secrecy. In truth it is difficult to see King, as the son of an Orkneyman and a member of the Swedish nobility, being happy about seeing his family's home islands given away to the enemy of the country he had served most of his life. King's father had been sheriff depute for his wife's cousin, Patrick Stewart, earl of Orkney, who had conducted what amounted to a private war against Christian IV over Danish attacks on Orcadian shipping. The plan fell through when Christian rejected Charles's offer to pawn the islands for 50,000 gold guilders, a sum which in his opinion overvalued them. Meanwhile King successfully wooed Sir John Cochrane, the Scottish emissary to Denmark and Hamburg, and played an important part in detaching him for the covenanting cause.<br>
<br>On his return to Scotland in 1641 King faced charges concerning his alleged unpatriotic behaviour in Denmark during the bishops' wars. However, in November the Scottish parliament dismissed the charges as groundless and declared that King had been a good patriot. While in Scotland, King maintained his Scandinavian connections, writing to the Swedish chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, expressing his hope of continued good relations between the Swedish and British monarchies. He also published a declaration about Danish negotiations with the empire which were suspected by both the Swedish and Scottish governments.<h2>
<a name="Thenorthernarmy"></a>The northern army</h2>After his short spell at home King returned to Hamburg to raise money for Charles I in preparation for the approaching war in England. On 28 March 1642 he was created by the king at York Lord Eythin, the title taken from the River Ythan in Aberdeenshire, where King had property at Birness and Dudwick. When he attended Henrietta Maria at The Hague in mid-November, there were those who doubted whether King would accept the command in England that she was urging him to take on; he had already responded to a previous request by demanding from Secretary Vane a recognized position and the regular payment of his pension. It was only on 18 December (<span class="smallcap">NS</span>) that the queen could write to her husband that King was willing to accept a command, though she did emphasize that it was advisable &#145;not to employ him under any one whom he might command&#146;. However, he had made clear that he would have no problems serving under the king's commander in the north: &#145;he has testified to me that whoever submits to serve under my lord Newcastle has simply to obey, and also that he has a particular esteem for my lord Newcastle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Henrietta Maria</span>, 150).<br>
<br>Eythin landed in Yorkshire in January or February 1643, and <i>en route</i> to the king's northern army mauled a force of Sir Hugh Cholmley's. He joined the marquess of Newcastle at York, where he was appointed lieutenant-general and commander of the infantry in the king's northern army and became Newcastle's principal military adviser in the campaigns of 1643 in Yorkshire and the east midlands and in the north the following year. According to Clarendon, Eythin, &#145;notwithstanding the unavoidable prejudice of being a Scotchman, ordered his foot with great wisdom and dexterity&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.466). The alliance between Scotland and the English parliament in September 1643 inevitably put Eythin in an invidious position: he faced an invasion by his fellow countrymen commanded by his old chief Alexander Leslie, now earl of Leven. In February 1644 King held Newcastle upon Tyne against Leven's forces; the Scottish soldier of fortune James Turner, who had served under King in Germany, later recorded that:<blockquote>I admired then nor could I wonder enough since, that he never endeavourd to give his countrymen a visite. He was a person of great honor; bot what he had savd of it at Vlotho in Germanie, where he made shipwracke of much of it, he losd in England. (Turner, 31)</blockquote>Turner may also have been reflecting on the fact that Newcastle's experienced army let Leven's raw troops outmanoeuvre them and march south. Suspicions about Eythin's reliability were evident in the English camp. Late in 1643 a packet of letters washed up at Scarborough included a letter from King to his agent at Hamburg, asking him to send him his horses with all speed, &#145;and in caise hee could not gett saife passage to England, hee should send them to Scottland, where Generall Leshley would give them a saife conduct&#146;. Newcastle had dismissed the suspicions of (the now royalist) Cholmley: &#145;hee had soe great assurance of Generall Kings fidelity that hee interpreted the great acquaintance and friendshipp formerly between Leshley and King might give him confidence to write such a letter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Memorials</span>, 147). Nevertheless such suspicions continued and led King to threaten to throw up his command and return to Germany. On 5 April the queen wrote to Newcastle urging him to appeal to his lieutenant's loyalty and silence those who spoke against him.<br>
<br>From 22 April Newcastle's army was besieged in York by the combined forces of Leven's Scots and the northern army led by the Fairfaxes, later reinforced by the army of the eastern association. Even Sir Philip Warwick, who in his memoirs regarded Eythin as no better than a traitor who had deliberately misadvised Newcastle to leave the north exposed to the Scottish invasion at the beginning of the year, grudgingly conceded that at York &#145;in this compact place Lieutenant-General King so demeaned himself, that as he shewed eminency in soldiery and personal stoutness, so there appeared no want of loyalty, for now he fought not singly against his own nation&#146;  (Warwick, 308).<h2>
<a name="MarstonMoor"></a>Marston Moor</h2>On 30 June the Scottish and parliamentarian army withdrew at the approach of the royalist relieving force under Prince Rupert, who, believing in Charles's positive command to attack the larger enemy army ordered Newcastle to draw his army out of York on 2 July. Eythin was opposed to the move and advised against Newcastle committing all his forces in such a risky business, but he was left to bring up the infantry. The foot, which had orders to march out of York at 4 a.m., did not reach Marston Moor until between two and four in the afternoon. Various reasons were given for this delay: that part of the infantry was too busy looting the abandoned enemy trenches, that it was pay day and the men would not march until they had been paid and&#151;according to the hostile Cholmley&#151;that Eythin had given an order for them to stand down. Modern historians of the battle, while acquitting Eythin of disloyalty, have concluded that he did indeed drag his feet in bringing the northern infantry to the battlefield and then only brought 3000 out of the 4000 foot in the city, perhaps in hope of preventing a risky battle that day. When he reached the field he was relentlessly negative when he spoke with the prince. According to Cholmley:<blockquote>The Prince demanded of King how hee liked the marshelling of his army, whoe replide hee did not approve of itt being drawne too neare the enemy, and in a place of disadvantage. Then said the Prince, &#145;They may be drawne a further disstance.&#146; &#145;Noe sir,&#146; said King, &#145;it is too laite.&#146; It is s[ai]d King dissuaded the Prince from fighting, saying, &#145;Sir, your forwardness lost us the day in Germany, where yourself was taken prisoner&#146;. Upon the disswasions of the Marquess and King, and that it was so neare night, The Prince was resolved not to ioyne battle that day. (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Memorials</span>, 136)</blockquote>The delay in King's infantry coming onto the field, with men still filing into position and the army relaxing from the preparedness of the day, gave the advantage and initiative to the enemy. In the ensuing battle Eythin commanded the second line of the royalist infantry, with about 1500 of the York foot in their allotted position and the rest strung out across the moor. The battle shattered the northern army. The following day Eythin's advice, that Newcastle should go into exile, &#145;conceiving the Kings affairs absolutely destroyed by loss of this battle&#146;, overbore that of the marquess's other advisers to head north to raise more troops  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Memorials</span>, 139). Newcastle, Eythin, and their party went to Scarborough and from there sailed to Hamburg where they arrived on 8 July. Eythin later learnt that a furious Rupert had considered recalling him and charging him with treason; in January 1645 he wrote to the prince protesting his innocence. In July 1644 the Scottish parliament forfaulted King for his service at Marston Moor.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In 1645 Eythin returned to Sweden where he was created Baron Sandshult in Kalmar, with a pension of 1800 riksdaler per annum. When the moderate engager party gained control of the Scottish government in 1647 his forfaulture was rescinded, and the Scottish parliament sent letters in his favour to both Queen Christina and the city of Hamburg.<br>
<br>In 1649 the new king, Charles II, sent orders to Eythin and Patrick Ruthven, to petition Queen Christina for military aid in support of the campaign being prepared by the marquess of Montrose. Eythin was commissioned lieutenant-general under Montrose in 1650 and was expected to command the major force destined for Scotland from Scandinavia; it was hoped that the two men would use their family connections in the Orkneys to raise support there. Only a small advance party ever sailed, and Eythin never left Sweden, as the king struck a deal with the new hardline regime in Scotland which left Montrose as the sacrificial lamb to be slaughtered as the price of Charles II's kingdom. Although alienated from the king by the betrayal of Montrose, Eythin did undertake negotiations to bring Charles to Sweden, but in the event the king did not come. In 1651 the Scottish parliament passed an act in favour of Eythin. He died a few months later in Stockholm on 9 June 1652 and was publicly buried on 18 June in Stockholm's Riddarholm Church, burial place of the Swedish kings. With his first wife Eythin had no children; with his second, whose name is unknown, he had a daughter who predeceased him.<br>
<br>Eythin's nephews, the sons of John King, both remained in Swedish service. James served as a page to King Charles X and he and his brother became naturalized Swedish noblemen in 1672. In his will, made in 1646, Eythin had earmarked his estates for his brother John and his family. However, his heavy investment in Montrose's campaign left him penniless. Over the years he had paid for royalist weapons out of his own pocket and lent the crown &pound;40,000. Neither this money nor his &pound;1000 pension was ever paid him. In Scotland a creditor took over the administration of his estate. In Sweden his property had to be sold to the Scottish commander Field Marshal Robert Douglas to pay some of his debts; the family never recovered from this burden. In 1684 Henry King and his mother received money from Charles XI to relieve their destitution: a Swedish king was left compensating for debts that should have been repaid by an ungrateful house of Stuart.<br>
