<span class="headword">Borthwick, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1835&#150;1912), <span class="occ">meat importer</span>, was born at Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, on 11 January 1835, the son of Thomas Borthwick of Edinburgh. He worked his way up from apprentice butcher in the family business at nearby Ratho, and at an early age it was clear that his real talent lay in assessing livestock. He was soon an acknowledged expert: it was said that he could walk into a pen holding 500 or more sheep and tell the weight and value of any of them at a glance; he was later to become a judge at the Royal Agricultural Show. He was only twenty-two when he established himself as a livestock agent, initially in Midlothian, but since he also handled Irish cattle landed at Liverpool he was attracted by the prospects there and in 1863 moved to Liverpool. In 1870 he rented a farm near Llanrwst in north Wales, and it was from there that he established a flourishing trade with Liverpool butchers. An indication of his drive is that, occasionally dissatisfied with prices, he slaughtered animals and sold direct to the consumer.<br>
<br>The 1860s and 1870s were years of experimentation in long-distance transport of meat from overseas suppliers. When refrigeration finally made it possible to bring meat across the equator from Australasia and Argentina (the first consignments of frozen meat were arriving by the late 1870s, the first from New Zealand in 1882), Borthwick was quick to recognize the possibilities in international trade in the product. In 1883 he became the selling agent for the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co. Ltd. He opened meat depots in Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, and Birmingham, and in 1892 transferred the firm's headquarters to London, at the same time securing a stall in Smithfield. This was the real beginning of the large wholesale and distribution business that covered the major livestock products of meat, wool, and tallow. But the main business was meat, and Borthwick was a leading figure in promoting the trade, especially in experimenting with chilling (as opposed to freezing) techniques, which indirectly made him responsible for improving the quality of Australian beef.<br>
<br>Borthwick married Letitia Banks of Liverpool in 1872, and had four sons and three daughters. All the sons went into the business; the eldest son, Thomas Borthwick (<i>b</i>. 1875), later Baron Whitburgh, went to Australia and New Zealand in 1904; he purchased meat-processing works and established branch offices at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Christchurch. That same year the firm became a limited liability company under the name of Thomas Borthwick &amp; Sons Ltd, registered with a capital of &pound;300,000. More meat works were added later, and the company continued to prosper until the early 1980s, and, together with the Vestey brothers, dominated the Australasian meat trade. At the time of his death in 1912 Borthwick was still chairman of Thomas Borthwick &amp; Sons Ltd and a director of Lancashire Cold Storage Co. Ltd, Thames Cold Storage Co. Ltd, and Thomas Borthwick &amp; Sons (Australasia) Ltd.<br>
<br>Borthwick was a staunch Presbyterian throughout his life, and contributed to church activities both in Midlothian and at Regent Square Presbyterian Church, London. He was in his late sixties before he took an active part in local Midlothian politics. In 1902 he was appointed chairman of the Midlothian Liberal Association, a post he held until his death, and in 1908 he was knighted for his services to the Liberals. He was known for being a plain and blunt man, and while he probably lacked any serious political ambition he was certainly not without friends in high places, being a close friend of Gladstone and later of Lloyd George and Asquith. Weeks before he died he was named as baron in the birthday honours, and so the title of Baron Whitburgh passed to his eldest son. Sir Thomas Borthwick died at his home, Whitburgh Ford, Midlothian, on 31 July 1912.<br>
