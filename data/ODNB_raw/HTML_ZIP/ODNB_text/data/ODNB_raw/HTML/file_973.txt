</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Babington,  Gervase</span>  (1549/50&#150;1610), <span class="occ">theologian and bishop of Worcester</span>, was born in Nottinghamshire, as Sir John Harington noted, &#145;by birth &hellip; a gentleman of a verie good house&#146;  (Harington, 129). Claims that he was a native of Devon, made by John Prince in 1701 and repeated by Browne Willis, are incorrect. No record of his mother's family has been found, but his father, Bernard Babington of Puxley, was closely linked to the main branch of the family at Dethick in Derbyshire which was to gain notoriety in 1586 with the conspiracy of Anthony Babington. For his university education Gervase Babington was sent to Cambridge where he matriculated from Trinity College in Michaelmas term 1567. The master at Trinity was the recently appointed John Whitgift who was to become his mentor. He graduated BA in 1571, was admitted junior fellow of the college on 28 September 1573, and then two years later proceeded MA. Babington was also incorporated at Oxford on 15 July 1578 (and again in 1589). At this stage he was becoming known as a &#145;hard student&#146; of theology, versed in Hebrew and Greek, recognized especially for a persuasive style of preaching, so that after his return to Cambridge he was selected preacher for the university in 1580.<h2>
<a name="ChaplaintotheHerberts"></a>Chaplain to the Herberts</h2>Of equal consequence for the advancement of Babington's career was his selection&#151;after recommendation &#145;by the ancients and heads of the said university&#146;&#151;as domestic chaplain to Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke. He served as chaplain at Wilton House in 1581 and possibly during part of 1582, and maintained a close relationship with the Herberts for the rest of his life. Mary, countess of Pembroke and sister of Sir Philip Sidney, was notable for her learning and scholarship, a true bluestocking in the best sense of the word; it was she who made Wilton &#145;like a little Universitie &hellip; a more excellent nurcerie for learning and pietie&#146;  (Hannay, 132). Mary Herbert completed the metrical version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> that she and her brother had started, although opinion is mixed as to whether Harington was correct that she needed Babington's help because &#145;it was more then a womans skill, to expresse the sence so right as she hath done in her vearse&#146;  (Harington, 129). This supposition has been questioned, on the grounds that the finished translation can be explained by reliance on the Genevan <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and commentaries.<br>
<br>Babington benefited greatly from the court position and extensive patronage of Pembroke whose massive landholdings were concentrated in Wiltshire and Wales, and from the earl's concern to forward the protestant cause. In 1581 Babington was made warden of St Giles's Hospital, Wilton, which was followed by appointments to a set of livings, all in Wiltshire: vicar of Bulbridge (1585), and rector of both Ditchampton and Wilton St Mary (1585). Part of this accumulation is explained by the law (21 Hen. VIII c. 13), which permitted domestic chaplains to peers to purchase a dispensation to hold two benefices in plurality. During this period Babington began to publish the first of his theological and pastoral works, partly derived from his instruction to the Wilton household. In 1583 he dedicated to Pembroke <span class="italic">A Very Fruitfull Exposition of the Commaundements by Way of Questions and Answeres</span> which went through three further editions (1586, 1590, 1596). The following year he published and dedicated to the countess <span class="italic">A brief conference betwixt Mans frailtie and faith wherein is declared the true use and comfort of those blessings &hellip; in the fifth of Matthew &hellip; laide down in the plain order of dialogue</span> (1584; 5th edn, 1602). This commentary on the sermon on the mount clearly shows his advanced Calvinism especially in the prayers for the family. In morning prayer God is to be praised because he has &#145;chosen and elected us for thy children, when others as good as we by nature shall burn in hell eternally&#146;  (Hannay, 133). Babington's writings proved to be very popular, usually represented in a number of editions, often enlarged and revised. <span class="italic">A Profitable Exposition of the Lords Prayer, by Way of Questions and Answers for most Playnnes</span> was dated at Wilton &#145;the ii of May 1588&#146;, this time dedicated to both Herberts. His teachings were practical &#145;aswell for the terror of the dull and dead, as for the sweet comfort of the tender harted&#146;. In the dedication he thanked his patrons for their great favours to &#145;me and mine&#146;. Babington must have married in the early 1580s; only his wife's given name, Joan, is known from the later probate of his will. Their son, John Babington, who was to matriculate at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 23 July 1603 (aged eighteen), was also a student at the Inner Temple in 1606.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalpreferments"></a>Ecclesiastical preferments</h2>Babington continued to add to his preferments. In 1588 he was installed in the prebend of Llandegla in the collegiate church of Brecon and also the prebend of Wellington in Hereford Cathedral. One of the requirements at Cambridge for the degree of DTh that he was granted in 1589 was the promise to preach at Paul's Cross within a year of his inception. He fulfilled this prescription with a sermon delivered on 11 October 1590 and printed the following year under the imprimatur of Archbishop Whitgift. The sermon unswervingly followed the Genevan line on predestination:<blockquote>All men [were] at the first before the Lord in his eternall counsell, to receive an end or use according to his will, to life or death &hellip; to heaven or hell. In which good pleasure of his &hellip; he hath disposed of some one way, of some another.</blockquote>Indeed Babington's sermon, one commentator asserts, &#145;must rank among the harshest of Elizabethan statements on predestination&#146;  (Tyacke, 253). He was appointed treasurer of Llandaff, being collated on 28 January 1590, and under this title he preached before the court at Greenwich on 24 May 1591. Babington was a committed Calvinist, not a puritan in the sense of a nonconformist. His court sermon was a vigorous defence of the ecclesiastical <i>status quo</i>, of uniformity, and church discipline against those who would prefer &#145;open assemblies in this land, and &hellip; erect a forme according to [their] wils, in woods, in fields, in holes and corners&#146;  (McCullough, calendar). Thereafter he was appointed with some regularity as a court preacher, usually on the Lenten roster.<br>
<br>An important advancement came with his elevation to the see of Llandaff, probably through Pembroke's influence and the archbishop's backing. He was elected bishop on 7 August 1591, confirmed on the 27th, and then consecrated on 29 August in the parish church at Croydon by Whitgift. He held on to his lesser preferments as commendams because the diocese was impoverished, the stipend valued at the meagre annual sum of &pound;154. His punning comment on Llandaff was that &#145;his true title should have bene Affe, for the land was gone&#146;  (Harington, 129). His cathedral was described in 1594 as in &#145;ruins and decayed state&#146;&#151;&#145;more like a desolate and profane place than a house of Prayer&#146;  (Williams, 326). Babington fits Fincham's model of an &#145;evangelical&#146; bishop whose primary role was always an active preacher and teacher. His activity as diocesan visitor and pastor is less distinct since there is no extant register or act book. However he was always a stickler for conformity, particularly against popish recusants. He was automatically a member of the council in the marches of Wales of which Pembroke was president and which had broad judicial and administrative powers especially against the suppression of recusancy.<br>
<br>Babington continued to write lengthy treatises even after he became bishop, and in 1592 published the first of his volumes on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, <span class="italic">Certaine Plaine, Briefe, and Comfortable Notes upon Everie Chapter of Genesis</span>. Its popularity is shown by the second &#145;enlarged&#146; edition of 1596 which had, in fact, doubled in length. The sequel on <span class="roman">Exodus</span> and <span class="roman">Leviticus</span> did not appear until 1604, and by then he had been moved twice. He was elected to the see of Exeter on 4 February 1595 and enthroned on 22 March. There is a rare description of a confirmation at Barnstaple in August 1595 when on his first visitation he laid his hands on &#145;divers children&#146; at the Castle Green. But on the following day such a crowd came in from the country that he withdrew to his lodgings and quietly left town, whereupon &#145;the people lamented that they had lost a fine harvest day&#146;  (Collinson, 52). The diocese was reckoned one of the poorest in England. Whether the low income or his ambition to push ahead explains his short tenure is open to question. The claim by Prince that Babington alienated the valuable manor of Crediton, one of the few remaining temporalities of the see which &#145;made Way for his translation&#146;, is a canard  (Willis, 1.649). In truth the manor was procured during the vacancy of the see by William, Lord Burghley, and his son Robert Cecil for a relative under the terms of the <span class="roman">Act of Exchange</span> of 1559. Babington was nominated by the queen to Worcester on 30 August 1597, elected on 15 September, and confirmed on 4 October. In contrast the new diocese was one of the more affluent English sees. On his translation he relinquished his prebend at Hereford but added at the same time the rectorate of Stokeinteignhead, Devon.<h2>
<a name="BishopofWorcester"></a>Bishop of Worcester</h2>A clearer picture emerges of Babington as an energetic and influential administrator at Worcester. He was commended for his constant preaching by Miles Smith, bishop of Gloucester after 1612, who edited the literary works of his former patron in 1615, and this claim was seconded by an anonymous clergyman, not of his diocese, in a work of 1601 which praised Babington's &#145;painfull preaching&#146; and scriptural commentaries  (Fincham, 88). Robert Abbot, brother of the archbishop and of the same cut of theological cloth as Babington, also noted his forceful preaching. Babington continued to serve on the council in the marches of Wales, and played a very active role sitting as magistrate at the quarter sessions, while working with determination to obtain convictions of popish dissenters at assize hearings. He likewise employed both preaching and personal argument to persuade papists to recant, methods approved by one who heard his &#145;publike exhortations or private conferences&#146;  (Questier, 172, n. 20). Like many bishops Babington inherited a dispute between the cathedral close and the Worcester civic authorities. When the latter attempted to secure a new charter from the crown, extending their jurisdiction over the cathedral precinct, he appealed to the earl of Salisbury to block the request, protesting that they were &#145;very injuriously encroaching&#146; upon his territory and the dean and chapters  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 18.460). The altercation, which dragged on from 1604 to 1607, was not settled until after the bishop's death.<br>
<br>Babington was regularly in his diocese, dividing his residence between the Worcester palace and Hartlebury Castle, with periodic appearances in London and at court to preach. His one foray into court politics ended almost disastrously. On 2 March 1600 Babington preached before the ageing queen at Whitehall in the Preaching Place, an outdoor pulpit open not just to courtiers but also to Londoners of lesser rank. The ill-fated second earl of Essex, even though under house arrest and in disgrace, still retained an enormous popularity with the masses. Chamberlain reported that the bishop &#145;made many profers and glaunces in his [Essex's] behalfe, as he was understoode by the whole auditorie, and by the Quene herself&#146;. When Babington was carpeted for his impertinence, &#145;he flatly forswore that he had any such meaninge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.92&#150;3). Despite his protestations Babington's name disappeared from the court sermon roster until the new reign.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandlegacy"></a>Last years and legacy</h2>Within a year of James I's accession Babington was one of nine bishops summoned to the Hampton Court conference to consider puritan demands for reform. Even though Stephen Egerton, one of the presenters of the <span class="roman">Millenary Petition</span>, in a letter before the conference identified him as one of three bishops who &#145;are turned Puritans&#146;, this characterization is highly doubtful  (Tyacke, 17). Babington would probably have endorsed Whitgift's Lambeth articles but there is no evidence that he ever abetted nonconformity. In his Paul's Cross sermon of 1590 he pleaded for moderation between puritans and the establishment, reproving such sins as bitterness in church controversy. A better characterization would be as a Calvinist episcopalian. Even so Babington was not in agreement with Bishop Bancroft, the chief spokesman for the establishment at the conference, who upheld the legality of lay baptism in case of necessity, a point Babington strongly contested. Not long after the conference Whitgift was buried at Croydon; his old pupil Babington preached the funeral sermon on 27 March, using as his text <span class="roman">2 Chronicles</span> 24: 15&#150;16 and comparing the late archbishop to Jehoida who &#145;had done good in Israel in the service of God and of his house&#146;  (Fuller, 10.26&#150;7). In April 1606 another confrontation between Babington and Bancroft took place in the House of Lords when Bancroft as primate tested opinion whether &#145;the papists might have a toleration for four years&#146;, and Babington retorted &#145;that it was pity they should be tolerated for seven days&#146;  (Questier, 141n.).<br>
<br>Babington died at Worcester on 17 May 1610, aged sixty, and was buried in his cathedral without a memorial. No will has been found but his public legacy was a large folio of five major works published in 1615. Included for the first time were his notes on <span class="roman">Numbers</span> and <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span>, thereby completing his collection on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>. Four editions, the last in 1637, show the influence of his writings. In 1624 Joseph Hall, a future bishop, opened the southern convocation with a sermon to his fellow clergy. &#145;I must say it,&#146; he informed them, &#145;<i>Stupor mundi clerus Britannicus</i>&#146; (&#145;The wonder of the world is the clergy of Britain&#146;). Making his point Hall listed some twenty learned theologians and &#145;eloquent&#146; preachers: named among his &#145;great lights&#146; of the English church was Babington  (Collinson, 92).<br>
