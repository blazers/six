<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Russell,  George William Erskine</span>  (1853&#150;1919), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born in London on 3 February 1853, the youngest of six children (two sons and four daughters) of Lord Charles James Fox Russell (son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24322/', "John Russell, sixth duke of Bedford")</script>), and his wife, Isabella Clarissa, daughter of William Davies of Pen-y-lan, Carmarthenshire. Lord Charles was an MP from 1832 until 1848, and was then appointed serjeant-at-arms attending the House of Commons, and Russell's childhood was spent in the official lodgings in Speaker's Court. It was there, he said, that he acquired the three enthusiasms of his life&#151;politics, religion, and books. He was a lame and sickly child; at Harrow School, where he was sent as a home-boarder, he could play no games. He went as a scholar to University College, Oxford, in 1872; there he combined studiousness with acquiring a reputation as a &#145;riding man&#146;, and was elected to Vincent's Club. In 1874 his physical ailments were compounded by myelitis; he described himself as &#145;maimed for life, with all hope of academic distinction at an end&#146;. He took a pass degree at Oxford.<br>
<br>Russell was elected to parliament as member for Aylesbury in 1880. Although born in the very purple of whiggery, he displayed independence of judgement, and, in spite of his personal admiration for W. E. Gladstone (tempered by a certain irreverence), he attached himself to the radical section of the Liberal Party. This caused him many difficulties with the duke of Bedford, and his constituents. He wrote articles for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, favoured the disestablishment of the Church of England, and was sympathetic to the &#145;unauthorized programme&#146; of Joseph Chamberlain. In June 1883 he was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the Local Government Board; his investigations of the London slums were partly responsible for the appointment of a royal commission on the housing of the poor in 1884.<br>
<br>Russell lost his seat in 1885. In 1889 he was chosen as an alderman of the newly established London county council, in the Progressive interest. He served until 1895, being particularly active in the movement to raise the tone of the London music-halls by prohibiting sales of alcohol on the premises. He was re-elected to parliament in 1892, as member for North Bedfordshire, and was appointed under-secretary for India, and then, in 1894, under-secretary in the Home department. He retired from politics in 1895, and devoted himself to his other two enthusiasms, religion and books.<br>
<br>From early life Russell was deeply interested in evangelical Christianity (he published, anonymously, a religious tract at the age of fourteen), and he had an abiding belief in personal social service. While at Oxford he taught at a Sunday school in Cowley and a night school at St Frideswide's Church. After Oxford he was influenced by the Christian socialists, especially Charles Kingsley and F. D. Maurice. He was a regular workhouse and hospital visitor, conducted <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, and was active in Christian missions. A prominent figure in purity movements, he was chairman of the National Vigilance Association in 1885, and one of the founders of the White Cross Society. After he retired from parliament, he was invited by Edward Talbot, bishop of Rochester, to do practical work in south London. In 1898 he became a diocesan lay reader. He maintained excellent relations with the dissenting movements, and spoke frequently at PSA (Pleasant Sunday Afternoon) meetings. He was strongly in favour of Church of England services for men only, as a means of introducing working men to church.<br>
<br>Russell wrote throughout his adult life (he first appeared in print at the age of thirteen, with some verses on a volunteer encampment). He was a regular contributor to many of the leading newspapers and periodicals; his weekly articles for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> were republished in two series of <span class="italic">Collections and Recollections</span> (1898). His religious opinions were set out in <span class="italic">A Short History of the Evangelical Movement</span> (1915), and his personal interpretation of whig philosophy in <span class="italic">Politics and Personalities</span> (1917). He edited the letters of Matthew Arnold, and wrote a number of biographies and memoirs, including those of Gladstone, Sydney Smith, E. B. Pusey, Bishop King of Lincoln, and H. P. Liddon.<br>
<br>Russell was one of the founders of the National Liberal Club. He was awarded an LLD by the University of St Andrews in 1899, and became a privy councillor in 1907. He died, unmarried, on 17 March 1919 at his house, 18 Wilton Street, London.<br>
