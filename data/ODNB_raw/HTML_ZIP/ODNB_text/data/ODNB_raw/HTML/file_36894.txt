<span class="headword">Wild,  (John Robert) Francis</span>  (1873&#150;1939), <span class="occ">Antarctic explorer</span>, was born at Skelton in Cleveland, Yorkshire, on 18 April 1873, the son of Benjamin Wild, schoolmaster, of Newcastle upon Tyne, who later kept a school at Eversholt in Bedfordshire. His mother was Mary (Pollie), daughter of Robert Cook, of Sheriff Hutton, Yorkshire. Robert Cook may have been a grandson of Captain James Cook, the circumnavigator, through the latter's son James who, according to the unconfirmed family tradition, was not drowned, as officially reported, but deserted from the Royal Navy and had therefore every inducement to conceal his identity. James abandoned his wife, and a man representing himself to Robert Cook as his father was in later years turned away from his putative son's door. At the age of sixteen Francis or Frank Wild (as he was known) went to sea in the merchant service, which he left as a second officer, transferring to the navy as a rating in 1900.<br>
<br>In 1901 Wild was accepted as an able seaman volunteer for the 1901&#150;4 National Antarctic Expedition of Robert Falcon Scott in the <i>Discovery</i>. He was a member of Albert Borlase Armitage's sledge party to the high plateau reaching an altitude of 8900 feet, the first high-level journey on the Antarctic plateau, and when a member of the party was lost over an ice-cliff in a blizzard, Wild demonstrated the resilience in the face of adversity that was to be his hallmark, keeping his head and leading the party back to safety. Wild became an experienced sledger on this expedition, gaining the skills that made him so valuable to future explorations. In 1907, on Ernest Shackleton returning to the Antarctic in the <i>Nimrod</i>, Wild was invited to join him and was one of the party of four that made the long southern sledge journey across the Ross Barrier, up the Beardmore Glacier, and over the high plateau to the record latitude of 88&deg;23' S, one of the greatest sledge journeys ever made. He showed himself to be an incomparable sledger, wiry, energetic, and buoyant, with great lasting powers and unusual muscular strength. It was this alone that saved him when, on the Beardmore Glacier, he narrowly avoided being dragged into a crevasse by a pony falling to its death. In 1911 Douglas Mawson, a member of Shackleton's 1907&#150;9 expedition, chose Wild as one of the few non-Australasians for his Australian Antarctic Expedition (1911&#150;14) in the <i>Aurora</i>. Wild was placed in charge of a party of eight which occupied the Western Base on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, from which useful sledge journeys were made into Queen Mary Land and to Kaiser Wilhelm Land. This was one of the most daring winterings in Antarctic history, since the base camp was 17 miles from the land, on floating ice.<br>
<br>Wild's next Antarctic expedition was as Shackleton's second in command on the British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which aimed to cross the continent from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea passing the pole <i>en route</i>. Obeying direct orders from the Admiralty, the expedition departed from Plymouth in the <i>Endurance</i> on 8 August 1914, after the outbreak of war in Europe. But after the wreck of the ship by ice pressure in November 1915 the explorers sought a desperate refuge on Elephant Island, whence Shackleton and five others made a boat journey to South Georgia for help. Wild had wanted to share the dangers of this voyage with Shackleton, but the latter relied upon him to lead the party of twenty-two men left on Elephant Island. There they inhabited little more than a sand-spit, &#145;a precarious foothold between the grim ice-fields and the treacherous, ice-strewn sea&#146;  (Shackleton, <span class="italic">South</span>, 173). Faced with meagre resources Wild kept up morale by constantly watching for the ice to clear and, when it did, confidently proclaiming: &#145;Roll up your sleeping-bags, boys; the boss may come to-day&#146;  (ibid., 191). On 30 August, four months after he had left, and at his fourth attempt, Shackleton returned. To Wild's &#145;energy, initiative, and resource&#146; Shackleton attributed the survival of all twenty-two of the Elephant Island party: &#145;He showed wonderful capabilities of leadership and more than justified the absolute confidence I placed in him&#146;  (ibid., 190).<br>
<br>On his return to England Wild was commissioned as temporary lieutenant RNVR early in 1917, and served as a transport officer on the North Russian front. In 1918&#150;19 he wintered in Spitsbergen with a small party in charge of an English coalmining property. He was appointed CBE in the 1920 new year's honours, in recognition of his war service and his role in the 1914&#150;16 Antarctic expedition. An attempt at tobacco planting in Nyasaland was cheerfully abandoned when in 1921 Shackleton prepared a new expedition to the Weddell Sea in the <i>Quest</i>. On the way south Shackleton died suddenly at South Georgia on 5 January 1922 and Wild took over command. A crack in the furnace of the <i>Quest</i> had already threatened the expedition, which was in any case &#145;a hybrid affair; a strange medley of the quest of lost islands and of the exploration of once-glimpsed ice-infested coasts such as no other polar leader than Shackleton &hellip; would have conceived&#146;  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 239). Under Wild it became an unexciting but worthy exercise in mapping and surveying, although without knowing it he moved within 60 miles of the Antarctic continent. This was Wild's fifth and last expedition. On 24 October 1922 he married Vera Alexandra (<i>b</i>. 1881/2), daughter of Theodore Bogosoff, tobacco broker. He had rescued her from Russia where she had been left stranded after the death of her husband, Granville Altman, a Borneo tea planter; there were no children. Wild reluctantly settled in South Africa and resumed for a time his farming, eventually moving to Klerksdorp, Transvaal, where, after a period of ill health, he died of pneumonia, on 20 August 1939. The award of a civil-list pension of &pound;170 in May had come too late to alleviate the penury of his last years. In 1924 Wild was awarded the patron's medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his outstanding services to Antarctic exploration; he had been awarded the society's Back grant in 1916.<br>
