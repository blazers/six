<span class="headword">Vizetelly,  Henry Richard</span>  (1820&#150;1894), <span class="occ">journalist and publisher</span>, was born in London on 30 July 1820 and baptized at St Botolph without Bishopsgate. He was the son and grandson of printers who were members of the Stationers' Company. According to family tradition they were descended from a Venetian named Vizzetelli who settled in England towards the end of the seventeenth century. His father was James Henry Vizetelly (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1838), a printer and engraver, and his mother was Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vaughan, of Cheshire. From 1831 to 1835 he was taught by a Mr Wyburn at a &#145;classical and commercial academy&#146; at Chislehurst. He was then apprenticed to the wood-engraver George William Bonnar. After Bonnar's death the following year he became a pupil of John Orrin Smith, another wood-engraver, and was formally apprenticed to his father at Stationers' Hall. He engraved several of John Leech's first successful drawings, <span class="italic">Paris Originals</span>, for <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> and sold sketches of the coronation of Queen Victoria to <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> and <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. In 1841, after coming of age, he became a partner in the printing and engraving business established by his elder brother James Thomas (1817&#150;1897) in Peterborough Court, London. The next year, inspired by the potential benefits to the business of a weekly newspaper &#145;more or less filled with engravings&#146;, he assisted Herbert Ingram in founding the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, for which he wrote the prospectus. Less than twelve months later, in partnership with Andrew Spottiswoode, the queen's printer, the two Vizetelly brothers set up their own weekly paper, the <span class="italic">Pictorial Times</span>. The literary staff included the <span class="italic">Punch</span> luminaries Douglas Jerrold, Mark Lemon, and Thackeray. Vizetelly sold his share to Spottiswoode at the end of 1844, ostensibly in order to devote himself to the expanding business of Vizetelly Brothers as printers, engravers, and publishers. The firm's most notable successes were achieved in the early 1850s, with engravings for David Bogue's editions of a number of Longfellow's poems and for the fifty or so volumes of the <span class="roman">National Illustrated Library</span>, published by Ingram, and with the publication of the first British edition of Harriet Beecher Stowe's <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> in partnership with Salisbury and Clarke. In 1848 Vizetelly established a short-lived illustrated weekly magazine, the <span class="italic">Puppet Show</span>, and in 1849 he scored a critical and commercial coup as an author with a fictitious diary, <span class="italic">Four Months among the Goldfinders of Alta California</span>, published by Bogue, that was almost universally assumed to be authentic.<br>
<br>When the newspaper stamp was abolished in 1855 Vizetelly, again in partnership with Bogue, launched by far the most successful of his journals, the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>, a twopenny weekly. Attracting the services of Frederick Greenwood, Robert Brough, Edmund Yates, George Augustus Sala, James Hannay, and many other up-and-coming journalists, it for a while boasted a circulation of over 200,000, double that of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>; Vizetelly claimed to have made a clear profit of &pound;1200 from the engravings for a single issue devoted to the marriage of the princess royal in January 1858. Herbert Ingram, still the proprietor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, reacted to the competition from the new paper by purchasing a one-third share in 1857 and buying Vizetelly out two years later for more than &pound;4000, but retaining him as editor for a further five years on an annual salary of &pound;800. In May 1858 Vizetelly had started a penny weekly, the <span class="italic">Welcome Guest</span>, edited by Sala and Brough, but after losing &pound;2000 or &pound;3000 on this he sold it to John Maxwell, also in 1859. Despite the undoubted profitability of many of his undertakings, Vizetelly's stock of capital may have been depleted by gambling and bohemian pleasures, in which he associated for some years with Sala, the acknowledged &#145;king&#146; of literary Bohemia. Sala's <span class="italic">Make your Game</span> (1860) presented a fictionalized account of their costly excursion to the roulette tables of Homburg in the autumn of 1858.<br>
<br>From 1865, when the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span> ceased publication, until the end of 1877 Vizetelly lived in Paris. For the first five years he was Paris correspondent and general representative on the continent of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, with a salary of &pound;800 per year, and he remained on the paper's staff for some time afterwards. He also contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, and <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>. He published <span class="italic">The Story of the Diamond Necklace</span>, based on Carlyle's well-known historical essay &#145;The Diamond Necklace&#146;, in two volumes in 1867, and a free translation of <span class="italic">The Man in the Iron Mask</span> in 1870. During the siege of Paris in 1870 both he and his seventeen-year-old son Ernest Alfred (1853&#150;1922) were transformed into war correspondents, dispatching their sketches of the beleaguered city to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> by &#145;balloon-post&#146;; to ensure that at least one would reach its destination, several photographs of each were sent by successive posts. Vizetelly subsequently retreated to England for a time, but his son, who remained in France throughout the war, was created a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur for the gallantry he displayed. He later collaborated with his father on a two-volume account of the siege, <span class="italic">Paris in Peril</span> (1882), and accompanied him on many of his assignments as the special correspondent of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> in various parts of Europe after the war. One of these, to Berlin in 1872, bore fruit in the book <span class="italic">Berlin under the New Empire</span> (2 vols., 1879). Both father and son made themselves authorities on wine during their long residence in France, Henry Vizetelly producing four monographs on the subject between 1875 and 1880 and serving as a wine juror at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873 and the Paris Exhibition of 1878.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1878 Vizetelly resumed his old business of publishing after a break of nearly a quarter of a century. Apart from relatively innocuous books by old friends such as Sala, the output of his new firm, Vizetelly &amp; Co., consisted chiefly of translations of French and Russian novelists, including Flaubert, Daudet, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy. Many of them affronted Victorian notions of propriety, which Vizetelly also challenged explicitly by publishing George Moore's <span class="italic">Literature at Nurse, or, Circulating Morals: a Polemic on Victorian Censorship</span> (1885), and by issuing cheap unexpurgated editions of <span class="roman">The Best Plays of the Old Dramatists</span> (the <span class="roman">Mermaid Series</span>). But it was above all his publication, between 1884 and 1888, of translations of seventeen novels by Emile Zola that brought him notoriety for the first time in his life and turned him into a reluctant martyr, one of the early heroes of the fight against oppressive literary censorship which culminated in the lifting of the ban on <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> in 1960. On 31 October 1888 he was fined &pound;100 for publishing <span class="italic">The Soil</span>, a translation of <span class="italic">La terre</span>, which the solicitor-general Sir Edward Clarke branded a work of &#145;bestial obscenity&#146;. To avoid a heavier penalty Vizetelly, on his counsel's advice, had pleaded guilty and promised to withdraw all his Zola translations from sale, although only a few weeks earlier he had issued a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Extracts Principally from English Classics</span>, to demonstrate that suppressing Zola's works would logically entail &#145;bowdlerising &hellip; the greatest Works in English Literature&#146;  (BL, private case 29<i>a</i>.45). By 30 May 1889 he had released the offending translations, minimally expurgated by his son Ernest, and was back in court. This time, again pleading guilty on counsel's advice, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and forfeited bail of &pound;200. <span class="italic">The Times</span> interpreted his plea of guilty as an admission that profit had been his only motive. By now he was sixty-nine and neither his health nor his finances recovered in the few years of life remaining to him after he had served his sentence. He died at Heatherlands, Farnham, on 1 January 1894. Just before his death he had the satisfaction of reading that Sir Edward Clarke's successor as solicitor-general, Sir Charles Russell, had led the applause for Zola when he read a paper at a meeting of the Institute of Journalists in September 1893.<br>
<br>Vizetelly had married Ellen Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pollard, the daughter of John Pollard MD, on 30 March 1844; she died about 1857. On 6 February 1861 he had married Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ansell, of Brompton, who died in 1874. The well-known author and lexicographer Frank Horace Vizetelly (1864&#150;1938) was a child of his second marriage. Two of the sons of his first marriage, not only Ernest Alfred but also Edward Henry (1847&#150;1903), won some fame as war correspondents, as did one of the sons of his elder brother James, Montague Vizetelly (1846&#150;1897). But in this sphere the best-known member of the family was Henry's youngest brother, <a name="cosubject_28343"></a><span class="headword">Frank Vizetelly</span>  (1830&#150;1883?), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, who was born at 76 Fleet Street, London, on 26 September 1830, educated at Boulogne, along with Gustave Dor&eacute; and Blanchard Jerrold, and first employed by Henry on the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>, of which he became Paris correspondent until his appointment as editor of <span class="italic">Le Monde Illustr&eacute;</span> in 1857. Having returned to England in 1859 he served as war correspondent first for the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>, then for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and later for other papers. He reported on the battle of Solferino (1859), Garibaldi's Sicilian and Neapolitan campaigns (1860), the American Civil War, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and the Carlist uprising in Spain in the 1870s. Finally, on 4 November 1883, he disappeared in the Sudan, near Kashgil, while covering the fighting between an Egyptian army under the command of William Hicks (Hicks Pasha) and the forces of the Mahdi. His name appears on a memorial to war correspondents in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
