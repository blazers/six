<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wells]</span>,  Joyce Shore</span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 354 Moseley Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham, on 13 December 1910, the only child of Arthur Edward Wells, photographer, and his wife, Florence Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jeary. She was educated at King Edward's High School, Birmingham, and worked briefly at the Society of Friends' Woodbrooke College. In 1934 she received a certificate in elocution from the London Guildhall School of Music and later taught drama. She married Abraham Victor (Vic) Butler (1911&#150;1992), with whom she had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Joyce and Vic Butler both belonged to the Labour Party and the Co-operative Society. Through the Co-operative Women's Guild she gained experience in organizing, educating, and agitating, and became known as a consumer champion. She ran unsuccessfully for local office in Birmingham before her husband's appointment as a Co-operative political organizer took them in 1946 to London where, in 1947, she was elected to Wood Green borough council. She eventually became deputy mayor (1961&#150;2) and, as chairman of the council's housing and planning and development committees for almost ten years, she oversaw the council's major house-building efforts of the 1950s.<br>
<br>In 1954 Butler became leader of Wood Green council, and was therefore well placed to win the Labour Party's nomination as candidate for the parliamentary seat when the sitting Labour MP stood down. Sponsored by the London Co-operative Society, she was elected MP for Wood Green in 1955 and held the seat until 1979. Her interest in local government remained strong, and she was vice-chairman of the Labour parliamentary housing and local government group from 1959 to 1964. Following the reorganization of the London boroughs, she served one term (1964&#150;8) on the new Haringey council, and was the unanimous choice to be its first chairman in 1964. She was succeeded by her husband when he was elected mayor on the first of two occasions.<br>
<br>Butler's concise, highly articulate, and well-informed speeches earned widespread respect. She was elected vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (1965&#150;70) and chairman of the Co-operative MPs, and had a place on the speaker's panel; in this latter capacity she chaired the House of Commons when it sat in committee. In 1965 she was made parliamentary private secretary to the minister of land and natural resources, Frederick Willey, but in May 1967 she resigned in sympathy with seven parliamentary private secretaries who had been dismissed for refusing to support the government over its application to join the EEC. One of her concerns was that prices would rise after Britain entered the Common Market. This episode ended her chances of a ministerial appointment, although her potential was recognized by Harold Wilson, among others.<br>
<br>Butler was one of the most active back-benchers, and was a persistent sponsor of private members' bills. A pacifist, who took part in the Aldermaston marches, she often spoke on nuclear issues. She raised frequent questions about consumer and environmental issues and, after repeated efforts, succeeded in passing the <span class="roman">Farm and Garden Chemicals Act</span> (1967) requiring detailed labelling of the contents of pesticides. Other bills which she introduced, particularly those seeking to protect consumers through improved labelling of food and hygiene products, were unsuccessful but increased awareness of that issue. She devoted much of her attention to health matters, asking the first parliamentary questions about the thalidomide drug. In 1964 she founded the Women's Cervical Cancer Control Campaign (later the Women's National Cancer Control Campaign), which united over forty interested organizations. A believer in alternative remedies such as naturopathy and osteopathy, she introduced a bill in 1976 to create a statutory register of all osteopaths who followed a recognized course of study. Other unsuccessful bills sought to safeguard patients' privacy from medical students and ban the advertising of sweets during children's television programmes.<br>
<br>Butler's other major concern was women's rights, and her most important achievement was the first bill outlawing discrimination against women in education, employment, and social and public life, and establishing a board to address complaints. Prompted partly by the case of a woman constituent barred from becoming a bus conductor, she introduced the bill four times, starting in 1967. Although she failed to obtain a second reading, the derision which greeted the issue steadily decreased. Like all her causes, the bill benefited from her manner of making points rather than scoring them. Subsequently sponsored by Willie Hamilton, who won a place in the private members' ballot, the bill formed the basis of Labour's landmark <span class="roman">Sex Discrimination Act</span> (1975), though Butler regretted that the legislation was weaker than her original bill. During her last term in parliament she maintained a watching brief for women's interests: with five others she left the House of Commons select committee set up to investigate the abortion laws over concerns that it intended to restore restrictions on abortions, and she chaired a committee investigating violence against children.<br>
<br>In 1979 Butler retired from the House of Commons to make way for someone younger and was disappointed that no woman was found to succeed her. She remained in demand as a speaker, and continued to be active in numerous organizations, serving as president of the London Passenger Action Confederation, vice-president of the Fawcett Society, chair of the Hornsey Housing Trust, and president of the Tottenham Hotspur ladies' football team. The preservation of England's landscape was one of her enduring concerns, reflected in her support for the Woodland Trust and the National Trust. Her years of community service in and out of parliament ensured an enduring popularity in Wood Green. After suffering a stroke on Christmas day 1991 she died of a heart attack in Highlands Hospital, Enfield, London, on 2 January 1992.<br>
