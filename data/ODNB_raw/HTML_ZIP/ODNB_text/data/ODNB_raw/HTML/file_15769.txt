<span class="headword">Knowles,  James</span>  (1759&#150;1840), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and lexicographer</span>, was probably born in Dublin, the youngest of three sons and one daughter of John Knowles of Dublin, and Frances, daughter of the Revd Dr Dennis Sheridan of Quilca; he also had a sister. His father, who worked as treasurer in Sheridan's theatre in Smock Alley, died at an early age, and his mother provided for her young family by opening a girls' school in Dublin which proved a financial success. His mother's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25371/', "Thomas Sheridan")</script>, elocutionist and author of a renowned <span class="italic">Pronouncing Dictionary</span>, directed his education and intended him for the church. This plan was thwarted when Knowles fell in love on holiday in Cork with a singer, Jane Daunt (<i>d</i>. 1800), daughter of Andrew Peace, physician. A great beauty, she was recently widowed and had an infant daughter. They married in 1780 and established a school in Cork in 1780, which soon prospered. Their first two children died in infancy but the birth of a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15770/', "James Sheridan Knowles (1784&#150;1862)")</script>, was followed by the birth of two daughters. The family's fortunes suffered when Knowles signed a petition for Catholic emancipation, and then went bail for a friend, the editor of a liberal paper, who had been prosecuted for libel by the government. His pupils, who were the sons of the local protestant gentry, deserted him, and in 1783 he and his family left Cork for London. He was helped by his first cousin Richard Brinsley Sheridan to continue his career as a schoolmaster, by setting up a private school in Sidcup.<br>
<br>Following his wife's death in 1800 Knowles married Miss Maxwell, but this remarriage did not please his son, who abruptly left home one day. Relations seemed to improve when James Sheridan Knowles relinquished his appointment as headmaster of the English department in the newly founded Belfast Academical Institution in favour of his father. Knowles gave up his school in Sidcup, which then had forty boarders, and began teaching in the Institution in April 1814, with his son as his assistant. This arrangement proved disastrous, not least because father and son differed fundamentally on the correct method and style of reading and elocution. These differences were exacerbated by Knowles's attitude; according to one historian of the school &#145;he displayed a mixture of truculence, petulance, tactlessness, bravado and down-right viciousness which made it a general relief when he finally went&#146;  (Jamieson, 13). After two and a half years in the post he was asked in 1817 to resign for the sake of the school, which had suffered a decline in pupil numbers, but he refused to go quietly. He published a pamphlet that claimed he was the aggrieved party and obtained a testimonial from some of the leading citizens in Belfast, but after barricading himself in the schoolmaster's house for several days, he was forced to leave. He returned to London, where he appears to have carried on his profession as &#145;teacher of reading, elocution, grammar, and composition&#146;  (J. Knowles, <span class="italic">Ortho&euml;py and Elocution</span>, 1829, title-page) for several years. In 1829 he seems to have joined his son in Glasgow, where he brought out a little book entitled <span class="italic">Ortho&euml;py and Elocution</span>. About this time, although he was now seventy and suffering from the stone, he began to compile a dictionary. His grandson recalled how he would rise at four in the morning and plod &#145;through his dismal labours with all the zest and enthusiasm of youth in the pursuit of some bright fancy&#146;  (Knowles, 122). It was published in London in 1835 as <span class="italic">A Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language</span> and was dedicated to William IV. A dispute with the printer over the number of copies embroiled him in a protracted lawsuit, which incurred costs of some &pound;3000 that were borne by his long-suffering son.<br>
<br>Knowles died at his son's house, Alfred Place, Bedford Square, London, on 6 February 1840, and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
