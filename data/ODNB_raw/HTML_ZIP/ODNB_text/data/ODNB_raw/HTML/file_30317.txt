<span class="headword">Abbott,  Evelyn</span>  (1843&#150;1901), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Epperstone, Nottinghamshire, on 10 March 1843, the third of the five sons of Evelyn Abbott, a farmer and landowner, and his wife, Mary Lambe. Educated first at Lincoln grammar school and afterwards at the Somersetshire College, Bath, Abbott was elected in 1862 to an open exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford. He gained a high academic reputation and was also a good athlete. In 1864 he won the Gaisford prize for Greek verse and a first class in classical moderations. In the Easter vacation of 1866, just before he entered for his final examination, he fell in a hurdle race and injured his spine. Unfortunately, unused to illness as he was, he did not recognize the serious nature of the accident, and continued his exertions, both at his books and at cricket, as if nothing had happened. In the summer he obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. In the following autumn, when the damage became obvious, it was too late for a cure; he became hopelessly paralysed in the legs, and never walked again. For thirty-five years, thanks to a very strong natural constitution and great courage and patience, he managed to overcome this handicap. He soon began to take private pupils, sometimes near his birthplace in Sherwood Forest, sometimes at Filey. In 1870 he was appointed sixth-form master at Clifton College by John Percival. In 1873 Benjamin Jowett, master of Balliol, invited him to return to Oxford, and until 1875 he took work at Corpus as well as at Balliol. In 1873 he graduated BA and MA. In 1874 he was elected a fellow and tutor of Balliol. From that time until his resignation, only a few days before his death, he was a mainstay of the administration and teaching of his college. At first he taught mainly Latin and Greek literature; in his later years Greek history was his principal subject. He became Jowett lecturer in Greek in 1895, was librarian of the college from 1881 to 1897, and in 1882 served as junior bursar.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Abbott was constantly engaged in writing in addition to his college work. He was well versed in German, and besides Curtius's <span class="italic">Elucidations of the Students' Greek Grammar</span> (1870) he published <span class="italic">History of Antiquity</span> (6 vols., 1877&#150;81), a translation of the work by Max Duncker. He also assisted Sarah Frances Alleyne (1836&#150;1884) in English versions of Duncker's history of Greece (2 vols., 1883&#150;6) and <span class="italic">Outlines of Greek Philosophy</span> (1885), a translation of the work by Zeller. He was editor of <span class="italic">Hellenica</span> (1880; 2nd edn, 1898), a collection of essays on Greek themes, and was general editor of the &#145;Heroes of the Nations&#146; series, to which he contributed a life of Pericles (1891). Other works were <span class="italic">Elements of Greek Accidence</span> (1874) and an index to Jowett's translation of Plato (1875). With Lewis Campbell he wrote a biography of Benjamin Jowett, master of Balliol and his lifelong friend (1897). His most important literary work was his <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> in three volumes (1888&#150;1900), admirable alike for its learning, sound judgement, and simple and lucid style. The sceptical view of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>, which regards them as purely works of poetical imagination, had not previously been so ably presented, and it demonstrated Abbott's independent method in treating historical problems.<br>
<br>Abbott, who was made LLD of St Andrews in 1879, maintained his activities until a few weeks before his death at Knotsford Lodge, Great Malvern, on 3 September 1901. He was buried at Redlands cemetery, near Cardiff.<br>
