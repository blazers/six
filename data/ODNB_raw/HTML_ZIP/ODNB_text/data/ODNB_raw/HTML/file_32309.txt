<span class="headword">Carruthers,  (Alexander) Douglas Mitchell</span>  (1882&#150;1962), <span class="occ">explorer and naturalist</span>, was born in London on 4 October 1882, the eldest son of William Mitchell-Carruthers (1853&#150;1931), who took orders in 1886, and his wife, Antonia, daughter of Atkinson Alexander Holden, who had been rector of Hawton, Newark-on-Trent. Educated at Haileybury College and Trinity College, Cambridge, he started in quite a humble way as secretary to various people who were working at the Royal Geographical Society, and underwent training in land survey work. He also learned how to skin animals and became an expert taxidermist. This enabled him to take part in expeditions which advanced his career. On the British Museum expedition to Ruwenzori and the Congo (1905&#150;6) he sent home remarkable specimens of birds and mammals. In 1907&#150;8 a German businessman and natural historian enabled Carruthers to travel in Russian Turkestan and the borders of Afghanistan. There he did research work on the various kinds of wild sheep in the Tien Shan (Tianshan) range of mountains. He established the territories inhabited by the <i>Ovis ammon</i> and <i>Ovis poli</i> and found another specimen of sheep, new to natural history, and later named <i>Ovis karolini</i>. He supplied many museums in Europe and America with specimens of these sheep at a time when very little was known about them. He then explored by himself the countries south-east of Syria and shot certain rare deer, among them the Arabian oryx, one species of which was hitherto unknown. He also made a collection of marmots, one of which was new.<br>
<br>Carruthers's next most important work was undertaken in collaboration with the big-game hunter John H. Miller and Morgan Philips Price. In 1910 they decided to explore the stony desert of Outer Mongolia, then part of the old Chinese empire, during the last years of the Manchu dynasty. The expedition took eleven months, crossed Siberia, and went up the Yenesei River to the source. The explorers had some difficulty in crossing the Sayansk Mountains on the Russo-Chinese frontier as they entered Outer Mongolia, but Carruthers was expert in dealing with obstructive officials. The country of the upper Yenesei basin was largely unknown. Only two Russian explorers had been there before and virtually no mapping had been done. Carruthers did some surveying and made some maps of the country watered by the Japsa River, which flows into the upper Yenesei north of the Tannu-ola Mountains. This was difficult forested and mountainous country which had never been worked at before. Carruthers and his colleagues were real pioneers, and the expedition owed much to his capacity for organization and leadership and his knowledge of human nature. His two volumes on <span class="italic">Unknown Mongolia</span> were published in 1913 and in the meantime he had been awarded the Gill memorial (1910) and the patron's gold medal (1912) of the Royal Geographical Society, which he was to serve as honorary secretary in 1916&#150;21.<br>
<br>During the First World War Carruthers was employed mainly at the War Office compiling maps of the Middle East. He ceased active exploration following his marriage, on 9 October 1915, to Mary (1878&#150;1962), the divorced wife of Major James Archibald Morrison MP and the daughter of Arthur Edwin Hill-Trevor, the first Lord Trevor. He settled in the countryside of East Anglia and his later career consisted largely in working at map making and with explorers and travellers. He published some articles and memoranda on various aspects of geography. His later books included <span class="italic">Arabian Adventure</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">Beyond the Caspian: a Naturalist in Central Asia</span> (1949). His work showed alertness to the impact of climatic and physical variations on all forms of life: a thought which ran through most of his lecturing and writing. He did some work on climatic conditions in central Asia, and continued some of the work started by Ellsworth Huntington and other geographers and explorers. He was interested in the idea that in the course of centuries a process of desiccation had been going on in the centre of the continent. This induced him to work in getting information about the old civilizations which had arisen and disappeared in central Asia, thereby adding to what had been done by Sven Hedin, Aurel Stein, and others. He was awarded the Sykes medal of the Royal Central Asian Society in 1956.<br>
<br>Carruthers's first marriage was dissolved in 1948 and in that year he married Rosemary Arden, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Charles Clay. He died in the Royal Free Hospital, Islington, on 23 May 1962.<br>
