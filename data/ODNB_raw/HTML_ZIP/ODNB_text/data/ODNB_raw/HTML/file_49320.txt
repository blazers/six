<span class="headword">Lewis <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Levy]</span>,  David</span>  (1823&#150;1885), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born in London, the son of Wolfe Levy, a Jewish merchant. He had at least one brother, who emigrated to Australia in the 1840s. In 1839 Lewis went to Liverpool to work for Benjamin Hyam &amp; Co., a firm of tailors and outfitters, and within eighteen months he was appointed manager of the Liverpool branch. In 1842 he was put in charge of opening new branches in Scotland and Ireland, and of supervising existing branches. On 6 September 1856 he married Bertha, daughter of Isaac Cohen, the rabbi in Dover.<br>
<br>Lewis started his own business at 44 Ranelagh Street, Liverpool, in 1846, selling men's and boy's clothing. Most of the clothes were made in his own workshop, as was usual at the time, and he also designed new clothes&#151;his speciality was knickerbocker suits. His customers were mainly working-class, and had not been able to afford tailoring before. From the beginning he established principles which were to guide his business throughout his life: he refused to haggle, setting a low price and sticking to it; he did not give credit; and he was always willing to exchange unsatisfactory goods. He never borrowed money, and he always ploughed his profits back into the business. In 1859 he opened premises in Bold Street, in a more fashionable area, and in 1864 began to sell London and Paris women's fashions. At the same time he was extending the Ranelagh Street shop, eventually buying five adjacent properties, and he built a clock tower, which became a Liverpool landmark. He continued to add departments, including women's shoes in 1874, and tobacco in 1879, and as the business expanded, he began to buy goods in from outside, making bulk purchases directly from the factories.<br>
<br>In 1877 Lewis opened a new shop, next door to George Henry Lee in Basnett Street, and called it Bon March&eacute;, after the Paris store. As in Paris, all kinds of goods were displayed, with the emphasis on women's fashions and Paris &#145;nouveaut&eacute;s&#146;. Lewis kept it completely separate from his main store, and its clientele was quite different. Its lavish attractions included a model of the Strasbourg Cathedral clock, and &#145;Christmas Fairyland&#146;.<br>
<br>A large new store opened in Market Street, Manchester, in 1880, built in the French Renaissance style, with six departments. Other departments were soon added, including a grocery department with deliveries twice a day to the suburbs. In the early 1880s Lewis began to sell tea, in response to the rapid expansion of tea drinking in working-class families, and Lewis's two-shilling tea became famous nationally. Another well-known line was velveteen: the velveteen department was the largest in the Manchester store, and a large mail-order section was developed. Lewis built extensions on to the store, and by 1885 there were seven floors.<br>
<br>Two more branches were opened in the 1880s. In 1884 a small shop opened at 15 Waingate in Sheffield, selling tea, and soon expanded to sell such familiar Lewis lines as velveteen and cigars, but, with a depression in the cutlery trade, Sheffield was not prospering at this point and the shop closed down at the beginning of 1888. The huge Birmingham store, however, opened as a department store in 1885 in the newly built Corporation Street, on 850 square yards of land leased from the Birmingham corporation, and focusing on women customers, attracted 40,000 on the opening day.<br>
<br>Lewis was always aware of the importance of advertising. In 1869 he began publication of halfpenny memorandum books, with advertising on the cover and in eight special pages in the centre, and sold 20 million in the 1870s. In 1882 he launched a series of <span class="roman">Penny Readings</span>, and sold a quarter of a million in the first eleven weeks. In 1880 and 1881 he spent 10 per cent of the gross sales of the Manchester store on advertising. When rival Manchester shopkeepers took him to court in 1881 for blocking the market square, Lewis printed 100,000 copies of his story of the trial and offered one to every householder in Manchester. Shortly before he died he chartered the famous steamship the <i>Great Eastern</i> for a year, arranging for it to be anchored in the Mersey estuary as part of the Liverpool International Exhibition of 1886, to be used as a social centre. 20,000 went on board in the first four days, and over half a million visited it.<br>
<br>Lewis died on 4 December 1885 at his home in Liverpool, after a long illness, and was buried three days later in the Hebrew cemetery, Fairfield. Out of a small men's tailoring business he had created a large department store, the largest in Liverpool, catering for the working classes of the north of England, with branches in other cities. He had no children, but he had encouraged members of his family to join what he always regarded as a family business. Louis Cohen, Bertha Cohen's nephew, who was born in Australia, and who married Lewis's niece, Mary Levy, succeeded him as head of the business.<br>
<br>Lewis set up the David Lewis Trust, to be used for charitable purposes in Liverpool and Manchester. His executors developed the David Lewis Northern Hospital, and in 1906 the David Lewis Hotel and Club Association was founded, as a neighbourhood centre, in the Liverpool docklands.<br>
