<span class="headword">Watts,  William Whitehead</span>  (1860&#150;1947), <span class="occ">geologist and educationist</span>, was born on 7 June 1860 at Broseley, Shropshire, the eldest son of Isaac Watts, music teacher, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitehead. After early education at a dame-school he attended Bitterley grammar school (1869&#150;70), where he developed an interest in chemistry and ventured into firework making, Shifnal grammar school (1871&#150;3), and Denstone College, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire (1873&#150;8). In 1878 he won an exhibition (converted to a scholarship) to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He gained first-class honours in the natural science tripos in 1881, and graduated BA in 1882. His MA was awarded in 1885 and his ScD in 1909.<br>
<br>From 1882 to 1891 Watts was a university extension lecturer for Cambridge; in 1888 he was deputy professor of geology at Oxford. In 1891 he became petrographer to the British Geological Survey, working in Ireland and in London, characteristically undertaking much more fieldwork than was necessary in order to ascertain geological facts to his own satisfaction and high standards. He also had responsibility for the survey's geological specimen collections in Dublin Museum and with A. McHenry wrote <span class="italic">Guide to the Collection of Rocks &hellip; Belonging to the Geological Survey of Ireland</span> (1895).<br>
<br>Watts returned to teaching in 1897 and was appointed deputy professor under Charles Lapworth at Mason College, Birmingham. The following year, Watts published his very successful <span class="italic">Geology for Beginners</span>, which ran to six editions, the last in 1937. In 1906 he became professor and head of the geology department of the Royal School of Mines (RSM) in London. Watts enlivened the department and developed a new postgraduate and research programme, encouraging both staff and students to attend Geological Society meetings and to read the latest literature. He built up the departmental library (later named the Watts Library) and developed the specimen collections. He always insisted on teaching the part one students, believing that it was both his job and his right to make and mould young geologists. Students and staff revered him for his intellectual abilities, his warmth, humour, and witty remarks, dubbed &#145;Watticisms&#146; (Williams, 16; Boswell, &#145;Presentation&#146;, 6). Indeed, Watts believed teaching was paramount, saying in response to a critic of his relatively small research output: &#145;I felt it was more profitable to produce tools than goods, and thus by producing researchers, one was putting one's talent out at compound interest&#146;  (Williams, 48).<br>
<br>Watts introduced courses in engineering geology in 1910 and qualifications in oil technology (1913) and mining geology (1918), to the RSM, by then a constituent college of Imperial College. These subjects were innovative, timely, and important additions to geological training in Britain. Watts was a far-sighted man with an interest in geology as a fieldworker and as a teacher. Though most of his career was spent as a lecturer, his fieldwork&#151;particularly on Charnwood Forest, Leicestershire&#151;is recognized as an outstanding contribution to the geological understanding of Britain. His <span class="italic">Studies of the Ancient Forests of Charnwood</span> was published in 1947. Watts retired from the RSM in 1930 and in appreciation of his work the geology department founded the Watts medal, for the best postgraduate student annually, and arranged for his portrait to be painted by Sir William Rothenstein. He was made emeritus professor of Imperial College and then of London University.<br>
<br>Married twice, coincidentally into the same old family, Watts had two daughters. First he married Louisa Adelaide Atchison (<i>d</i>. 1891) in 1889. She was descended by the female line through the Turnour (Winterton) and Richardson families from Robert the Bruce. There was one daughter from this marriage, Beatrix Mary Adelaide, who married the geologist William George Fearnsides. Second, in 1894 Watts married Rachel Atchison, widow of Arthur Turnour Atchison (secretary of the British Association and a civil engineer), daughter of Ebenezer Rogers, a mining engineer and geologist in Monmouthshire. The couple later had one daughter.<br>
<br>Watts was a gregarious man, enjoying learned society meetings and dinners; this and his interest in progress led him to be an active member of various organizations and committees related to geology and to university teaching, working tirelessly as a committee member, secretary, or president. Among these was the chairmanship of Sutton Coldfield higher education sub-committee (1904&#150;6) during which he succeeded in building and opening a technical school. Elected FRS in 1904, he held a record for periods as a councillor (1913&#150;14, 1917&#150;19, 1929&#150;31). He was president of the Geological Society of London between 1910 and 1912, and was awarded their Wollaston fund in 1895, the Murchison medal in 1915, and the Wollaston medal in 1927. Watts was twice president of section C of the British Association, in 1903 and 1924, and president of the British Academy in 1935. His 1924 address summed up his attitude to the science of geology; it was entitled &#145;Geology in the service of man&#146;. He received many awards throughout his distinguished career in public service as a civil servant and lecturer, including honorary LLDs from St Andrews and Edinburgh universities; fellowship of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1888 and honorary fellowship in 1910; and fellowship of Imperial College, London, in 1945. Watts died on 30 July 1947 at the Kingslea Nursing Home, Mulgrave Road, Sutton, Surrey. After cremation at Church Stretton, Shropshire, his ashes were buried in Cambridge. It was said of him that &#145;No man &hellip; has exercised more influence on the development of British Geology during his lifetime than Professor W. W. Watts&#146;  (Williams, 8).<br>
