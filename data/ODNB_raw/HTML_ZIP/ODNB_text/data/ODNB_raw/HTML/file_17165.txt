<span class="headword">Lugaid <span class="st"> [Lughaidh]</span> mac L&oacute;egairi</span>  (<em>d.</em> 507), <span class="occ">high-king of Ireland</span>, was one of twelve sons attributed to L&oacute;egaire mac N&eacute;ill; his mother was said to have been Angas ingen Ailella Tassaig. He became high-king of Ireland at some point after 482, when Ailill Molt, his predecessor, was killed. Some chronicle accounts say that Lugaid was part of an alliance which defeated Ailill Molt, but the main hand of the annals of Ulster&#151;in general the most reliable of the chronicles&#151;ignores him utterly, save in a brief notice of his death (in 507, repeated in 508). During his reign battles were regularly undertaken by other descendants of Niall No&iacute;giallach, such as Coirpre and Muirchertach Mac Erccae, but Lugaid himself appears wholly inactive, which is somewhat unusual for a high-king of Ireland. It has even been suggested that he was never high-king at all, but was inserted into the regnal scheme in order to fill a gap caused by a backdating of the mission of St Patrick. However, his reign is attested in the earliest king-list, <span class="italic">Baile Chuinn</span>, and indeed in all subsequent lists.<br>
<br>Lugaid had at least two sons, one called Guaire, and is said to have been married to Niam, daughter of the king of the Ulstermen. His progeny, Clann Lugdach, was a lowly U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasty and no high-kings of Ireland came from it. The tripartite life of Patrick, with the benefit of hindsight, tells how Lugaid's father, L&oacute;egaire, was converted by the saint while Lugaid was in his mother's womb. Patrick cursed L&oacute;egaire on account of earlier disobedience, saying that only one king, Lugaid, would come of his offspring (that concession was granted on account of the mother's petition). Patrick said of the unborn child, &#145;Till he opposes me, I will not curse him&#146;  (Stokes, 1.61). However, after Lugaid became king he uttered a mocking remark about the curse on his father's descendants and in consequence was struck dead by a thunderbolt in 507, at &#145;Achad Forcha&#146;. He was one of at least three fifth-century high-kings of Ireland to die by the elements and so it is possible that the story of Patrick's malediction has overlain an earlier legend of Lugaid's death by lightning.<br>
