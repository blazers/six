<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  (James William) Francis</span>  (1899&#150;1980), <span class="occ">lawyer and historian</span>, was born at 34 Tentercroft Street, Lincoln, on 15 September 1899, the elder of the two sons of James Hill, an immigrant to Lincolnshire from his native Scotland, and his English wife, Millicent Blinkhorn. James Hill worked in Lincolnshire as a travelling tailor.<br>
<br>Hill was educated at the Lincoln Technical School. In 1918 he was commissioned into the King's Royal Rifles (60th Rifles) and served in France until 1919. After demobilization he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1921. He was then articled to a Lincoln solicitor, Russell Race, and was admitted to the roll of solicitors in January 1926. He was immediately taken into partnership, and remained a partner in the firm until his death. The minutiae of provincial legal practice, however, did not satisfy him and he soon became involved in the public life of the city.<br>
<br>Hill was elected a city councillor in 1932, and served as councillor and later alderman until 1974, leading the independent group which controlled the council for a period after the Second World War. He was mayor in 1945&#150;6 and was elected a freeman of the city in 1961. For many years he chaired the Lincoln education committee, and a primary school in the city is named after him. He was twice an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate: first as a Liberal, at Peterborough in 1929, and then as a Conservative and Liberal National, at Lincoln.<br>
<br>Over time Hill fought many local battles in Lincoln. In 1928, a threat to the twelfth-century Jews' House from a local slum clearance scheme was successfully resisted. Years later, when Lincoln corporation, backed by the Central Electricity Generating Board, planned to erect at the Lincoln power station a group of cooling towers 220 feet high which would have cut off the historic view of Lincoln from the south-west, he managed, if not to prevent their being built at all, to get their height reduced to 60 feet. His campaign in 1955 to prevent the diversion of the Roman Ermine Street north of the city to make room for a runway extension at Royal Air Force, Scampton, was finally unsuccessful, but his vigorous resistance did ensure that the decision was taken right up to cabinet level.<br>
<br>Frank Hill (as he was generally called) became a leading figure in local government. He was chairman of the association of municipal corporations from 1957 to 1966, and a member of the royal commission on local government (the Maud commission) from 1966 to 1969. He was chairman of the Standing Advisory Committee on Grants to Students from 1958 to 1966 and a governor of the Administrative Staff College, Henley, from 1960 to 1969. His chairmanship of the association of municipal corporations led in due course to his election as president of the European conference of local authorities, whose headquarters were at Strasbourg, a post he occupied from 1966 to 1968. He was subsequently president for three years of the International Union of Local Authorities at The Hague, an appointment that involved frequent extensive travel. From 1972 to 1978 he was chairman of Municipal Mutual Insurance plc and was regarded with affection by both senior and junior staff. In his honour the company in 1972 endowed the Francis Hill chair of local government at Nottingham University. He was made a CBE in 1954 and in 1958 received a knighthood for services to local government. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Lincolnshire in 1974.<br>
<br>Hill's service in local government and his professional work as a solicitor informed his distinguished work as a local historian of Lincoln. His four volumes of civic history, published by Cambridge University Press, <span class="italic">Medieval Lincoln</span> (1948, repr. 1965), <span class="italic">Tudor and Stuart Lincoln</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Georgian Lincoln</span> (1966), and <span class="italic">Victorian Lincoln</span> (1974) were highly regarded. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and an honorary vice-president of the Royal Historical Society.<br>
<br>Hill's work for education included serving as chairman of the governors of Lincoln School and Lincoln Girls' High School from 1935 to 1966. In 1938 he became a member of Nottingham University College council and then served as its president from 1948 and pro-chancellor in 1959. For twenty eventful years during the building of the university's splendid campus and its wide academic organization he gave the creative leadership the period required and, in recognition of this, was elected chancellor in 1972, remaining so until he retired in 1978. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge (1950), Nottingham (1961), Birmingham (1961), and Leicester (1974).<br>
<br>Hill leased from the dean and chapter of Lincoln a house in Minster Yard known as The Priory; he restored it substantially and in his will devised it back to the chapter. He died there, after suffering a heart attack, on 6 January 1980, and was buried at Newport cemetery, Lincoln. He was unmarried. By his will the pictures which he collected at The Priory were given to the city of Lincoln and his considerable library was bequeathed to Nottingham University. His collection of some 1400 Anglo-Saxon and Norman coins, of which nearly a thousand were minted in Lincoln or Stamford, was presented by him to the city in 1974.<br>
