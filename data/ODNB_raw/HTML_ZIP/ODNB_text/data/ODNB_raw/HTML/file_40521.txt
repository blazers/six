<span class="headword">Wheler,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1732, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">chairman of the East India Company and administrator in India</span>, was baptized on 27 April 1732 at Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire, the fourth of the five sons of Sir William Wheler, baronet (<i>d</i>. 1763), and his wife, Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1740), daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, baronet, of Bicester, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Sophia. Although boys of the family usually attended Rugby School, Edward Wheler did not, and particulars of his education appear to have gone unrecorded. He started business as a linen draper in Cornhill, although his firm, Wheler, Higginson &amp; Co., later handled government contracts and further diversified into providing financial services to East India Company servants and others in India. He was first elected a director of the East India Company in 1765. For the elections held in April 1773 two rival lists of candidates were presented: a house list expected to continue the policy of the incumbent administration in opposing government interference in company affairs, and a proprietors' list backed by government. Included in the victorious proprietors' list, Wheler was chosen as deputy chairman. Three months later the chairman died, and Wheler was propelled into his place. After the financial crisis of 1772 the company was in dire need of purposeful leadership. This Wheler was temperamentally ill-equipped to provide, and his thoughts turned towards securing a seat in the Bengal supreme council, which was predominantly a legislative body with authority over the East India Company's other presidencies.<br>
<br>In October 1776, when Hastings's resignation by proxy was accepted by the directors, Wheler waited on John Robinson, Lord North's right-hand man, to bid for the consequent vacancy in the Bengal council. The choice lay between Wheler and Justice Chambers of the Calcutta supreme court. The king signalled his support for Wheler as &#145;most likely to be acceptable to the Court of Directors and as a person who has steadily supported Government&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 37833, fol. 87). Wheler was duly appointed. However, when Hastings annulled his resignation Wheler's commission had to be hurriedly altered to allow him to fill the vacancy arising from the death of Colonel George Monson.<br>
<br>Wheler arrived in Calcutta in October 1777. Affable, kindly, and impressionable, he had no very strong views of his own and readily bent to those of stronger-willed individuals around him. His advent critically affected the balance between the two parties in council. Would he follow Hastings or would he join with Philip Francis? No sooner had the <i>Duke of Portland</i> entered the Hooghly than Wheler was assiduously courted by emissaries from both factions. A decision had to be made. A genuine enough fever aided and abetted his vacillation but in the end, unsurprisingly given his past record, he sided with Francis. For the ensuing three years Wheler did his best to satisfy his demanding ally.<br>
<br>Wheler's wife, Harriet Chicheley (1740&#150;1778), the fourth of the twelve children of the Revd James Chicheley Plowden, whom he had married in 1772, accompanied him to Calcutta, but died after only seven months. In 1780 Wheler married Charlotte (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1738), the daughter of George Durnford, a Winchester attorney. There were two daughters.<br>
<br>In failing to win over Wheler, Hastings wrote him off as &#145;a mere cypher and the echo of Francis&#146;  (Gleig, 2.186), yet after Francis had returned to England in 1780, and John Macpherson and John Stables had joined the council, Hastings came to count on Wheler's reluctant acquiescence in his policies. In 1784 he wrote:<blockquote>Mr Wheler is really a man of business. Yet I cannot convince him of it, nor persuade him to trust to his own superiority. He &hellip; will always be [guided] by those who command him, and possess, at the same time, a majority of voices. (ibid., 3.145&#150;6)</blockquote>G. G. Ducarel stated the case rather more bluntly when he observed that Wheler &#145;abhors Hastings's measures but has not the strength of mind to resist him&#146;  (Ducarel to Francis, 27 July 1782, BL OIOC, MS Eur. E21, item 16). In fact, Wheler claimed that Francis had previously agreed that active opposition to Hastings's measures would &#145;not only be <i>useless</i>, but <i>dangerous</i>&#146;  (Wheler to Francis, 5 Dec 1782, BL, Add. MS 40763, fols. 136&#150;8), although that did not deter Francis from trying to direct Wheler from a distance by correspondence.<br>
<br>Wheler died of a burst blood vessel at Suksaghur, 35 miles north-east of Calcutta, on 10 October 1784, and was interred in South Park Street burial-ground, Calcutta, next day. He left &pound;40,000 and the residue of his estate to his wife, and &pound;5000 to each of his daughters. Wheler was a thoroughly decent man who rose above his capabilities.<br>
