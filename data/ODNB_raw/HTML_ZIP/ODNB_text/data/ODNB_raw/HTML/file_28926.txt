<span class="headword">Webb,  Jonas</span>  (1796&#150;1862), <span class="occ">stock breeder</span>, was born on 10 November 1796 at Great Thurlow in Suffolk, the second son in the family of nine children of Samuel Webb, who later moved to Streetly Hall, West Wickham, in Cambridgeshire. Webb began farming on a 1000 acre farm at Babraham, near Cambridge, in 1822. Following experiments he carried out with his father, he decided against the native Norfolk breed of sheep and devoted himself to the breeding of Southdowns, which were then relatively rare in the area. He bought sheep from John Ellman of Glynde, in Sussex, and worked to produce his own improved strain, with a better fleece quality and earlier maturity. This had a permanent influence on the breed, which was sometimes called the Cambridge Down. After the death of Ellman in 1832, Webb became the leading Southdown breeder. At full strength, his flock numbered 2400. The Babraham Southdown was exported to Spain, France, and Germany, and also to Australia and America.<br>
<br>Webb first exhibited at the second country meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, held at Cambridge in 1840, where he won two prizes for his Southdown ewes. This success was followed up at nearly every subsequent annual meeting at which he exhibited, until at Canterbury in 1860 he took all of the six prizes offered by the society for rams, and he sold the first prize ram, &#145;Canterbury&#146;, for 250 guineas. He had great success with the Shearling rams that he exhibited at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1855, for which he received a gold medal of the first class. Webb presented a ram to Emperor Napoleon III after the latter had admired his exhibits, and he received a present of a large silver candelabra in return.<br>
<br>During the last two years of Webb's life the Babraham flocks were sold, with 1406 sheep fetching &pound;16,646 at auction in 1861, but Webb continued to breed cattle successfully. His herd of shorthorns, begun in 1838 when he bought animals from Lord Spencer and Lord Ducie, was mentioned by M. Tr&eacute;honnais in 1859 as the most important shorthorn herd then existing, and one which few other breeders had surpassed in beauty and perfection. At the Royal Agricultural Society's show held at Battersea in 1862, after the dispersion of his flock of Southdowns, Webb's shorthorn bull calf &#145;First Fruit&#146; gained the gold medal as the best male animal in the shorthorn class.<br>
<br>Webb died at 7 Peas Hill, Cambridge on 10 November 1862, five days after the death of his wife. He was buried at Babraham on the 14th. He left four sons and five daughters. A statue of Webb was put up in the corn exchange in Cambridge.<br>
