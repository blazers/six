</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Currie, Sir  Donald</span>  (1825&#150;1909), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born on 17 September 1825 at Greenock, the third son of James Currie (1797&#150;1851), a barber, and Elizabeth (1798&#150;1839), daughter of Donald Martin. The family moved from Greenock to Belfast in 1826, where they belonged to the conservative Presbyterian congregation in Fisherwick Place.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlycareer"></a>Education, marriage and early career</h2>Currie was educated at the Belfast Academy and the Royal Belfast Academical Institution from 1832 to 1839. In 1840 he returned to Greenock, working in the shipping office of his uncle John Martin of Hoyle Martin &amp; Co., and four years later, like so many Scots, went south to Liverpool, joining Charles MacIver, family friend and manager of Samuel Cunard's British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. It was not long before he settled into Liverpool life. As a member of the Presbyterian congregation at the new Free Church in Canning Street, he played his part in setting up the Young Men's Evangelical Association, and in 1851 married Margaret, daughter of another Scot, John Miller, senior partner in the general merchants Miller, Houghton &amp; Co. Currie and his wife had three daughters. Appointed head of the cargo department, he travelled on the continent between 1849 and 1854 to establish new agencies at Le Havre, Paris, Antwerp, and Bremen, and took much of the responsibility for MacIver's Mediterranean interests as far afield as the Levant and the Black Sea. By 1859 he was a well-regarded figure in local shipping circles, becoming treasurer of the powerful Liverpool Steam Ship Owners' Association.<h2>
<a name="OpeningtheCastleLine"></a>Opening the Castle Line</h2>Currie left Cunard in 1862 to run his own sailing ships as the Castle Line from Liverpool and London in the India trade. At first he concentrated on Calcutta, exploiting the novelty of a regularly timetabled service, but soon began to diversify his activities, chartering vessels to other Asian ports and exploring the possibilities of the Calcutta&#150;New York connection. From 1863 he also moved into the regular Baltic trade. An elder brother, James, was manager of the Leith, Hull, and Hamburg Steam Packet Company; Donald became one of its principal shareholders, and in 1866 with other partners also set up his own Liverpool and Hamburg Steam Ship Company.<br>
<br>The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, rapid growth in the size of ships, and the introduction of steam shipping on the routes to the East, created a new and very difficult set of conditions. While other important competitors moved quickly, Currie's already extended operations and relatively limited resources made him hesitant, both in building new steamers and in committing them to India. His loss of a new ship on its maiden voyage in 1872, and a developing connection with the London shipbroker G. H. Payne who chartered some of Currie's boats for a new service to the Cape of Good Hope, were decisive. Currie switched to the much smaller and less lucrative Cape trade in competition with the existing holder of the imperial government's mail contract, the Union Steam Ship Company. Using his position in the Leith, Hull and Hamburg to buy or charter several of their vessels, in addition to his new purchases, he wooed the Cape merchants and in 1874 won a colonial government subsidy to help his newly formed Castle Packets Company survive the next two years. Officials and merchants, dissatisfied with the Union Company's service and hoping for miracles from a breath of competition, were happy to see the mail contract divided with Currie when it was renegotiated in 1876.<br>
<br>Currie seized the opportunity of an upturn in trade and a measure of security to expand his company rapidly, more than doubling the Castle Company's tonnage to 48,000 by 1881. The company itself was also reorganized, first in 1877 with an expanded capital, Currie himself as the largest shareholder, and his family enterprise of Donald Currie &amp; Co. as its managers. Then, in 1881, the new Castle Mail Packets Company Limited was floated publicly, with a subscribed capital of &pound;720,000 and further resources of nearly &pound;0.5 million; Currie was made manager in perpetuity, in return for which he enjoyed the highly favourable remuneration of 5 per cent per annum of the company's gross earnings.<br>
<br>Public relations were quite as essential as financial preoccupations to Currie's style of management in the 1870s and to the initial establishment of Castle Mail. Joining the Royal Colonial Institute in 1874, he carefully cultivated prominent public figures both in Britain and in South Africa, including Sir John Molteno, the Cape's prime minister, whose son Percy later married Currie's daughter Elizabeth, and Sir Robert Herbert, permanent under-secretary at the Colonial Office. He was very active among shipowners in shaping the mercantile marine safety legislation of 1876, and received the Royal Society of Arts Fothergill gold medal for his contributions to safety in shipbuilding. He mediated between President Brand of the Orange Free State and British officials in their dispute over the diamondiferous territory of Griqualand West, and supported the Boer delegation to London in 1877 protesting against the Transvaal's annexation; he scored a lucky coup by both bringing to Britain news of the devastating defeat at Isandlwana and speedily taking back the military instructions which averted further disasters; and he subsequently gave evidence to the Carnarvon commission on Britain's naval defences.<h2>
<a name="PoliticsandthedevelopmentofCastleMail"></a>Politics and the development of Castle Mail</h2>Frequenting corridors of power, he also entered national politics, unsuccessfully contesting the Greenock election of 1876 and becoming Liberal MP for Perthshire in 1880. Currie, however, never had strong political ambitions. His political involvement, like his contacts with influential officials and public figures, remained limited to areas likely to serve his business interests, by providing him with contacts or information and building up his reputation for respectability. It was a successful strategy, symbolized first by his appointment as a CMG in 1877; and then by a knighthood in 1881. On his ships, as later on the neighbouring Perthshire estates of Garth and Glen Lyon which he purchased in 1880 and 1885, he enjoyed entertaining the influential and the journalists who might record the events. In 1880 and 1881 Gladstone was prominent among those entertained in a style which prompted <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>'s Spy to caricature Currie on the occasion of his elevation to a KCMG, as &#145;Knight of the Cruise of Mr. Gladstone&#146;  (21 June 1884). Currie's orchestration of personal publicity and public flotation in the summer of 1881 was brilliant, with <span class="italic">The Times</span> noticing Castle Mail's prospectus and Currie's new title on the same day (20 July 1881). Not a week later, on 25 July, Currie entertained a large gathering of British and colonial MPs, shipping representatives, and minor British and Prussian royalty on board his new and largest steamship at the opening of Leith's new docks.<br>
<br>Amid the accumulated pomp and circumstance which impressed most onlookers as intended, Currie's shaping of the new Castle Mail company represented a most striking business coup. With competition on the Cape route stiffening, with a serious downturn in commercial conditions upon him as the diamond share boom broke and imperial military spending in southern Africa sharply declined, Currie not only obtained an astonishingly high price for his old company, but transferred to the new shareholders a significant proportion of the costs of its recent expansion. Moreover, the structure of Castle Mail left Currie virtually free to indulge his enjoyment of display and personal prominence at the company's expense, and unhampered by any effective control by shareholders over his management. The &#145;council&#146; which oversaw the company's affairs sounded impressive but lacked power, for it was composed almost entirely of Currie's friends and nominees; useful for their social standing or government connections in colonial affairs, at the Admiralty, and in telegraph construction, they did not possess the working knowledge of company matters which might have benefited shareholders.<br>
<br>In Castle Mail, Currie had created perhaps the grandest example of a phenomenon common at the time, that of the shipping company in which shareholders' losses financed managerial self-indulgence and extravagance, and where, despite mounting criticism from newspapers and a few investors, no effective opposition emerged. Throughout its life Castle Mail's declared and distributed profits frequently compared unfavourably with other major companies'. Returns were kept within the firm, details of earnings and managers' commissions remained confidential; to finance its further operations and expansion, Currie very cleverly deployed the significant reserves created at flotation together with generous annual allowances for depreciation and successive bank loans, rather than risk his authority by trying to raise further ordinary share capital against the company's persistently discounted shares. This position he was able to sustain for almost twenty years.<h2>
<a name="TheSouthAfricanshippingconference1883"></a>The South African shipping conference, 1883</h2>Currie's further distinction as a shipowner in the 1880s lay in his role as architect of the South African shipping conference. Against the background of severe economic depression, he brought the several southern African lines together in 1883 to defend their common interest in avoiding a rate-cutting war and possible bankruptcy. Agreed rates, pooled cargo, controlled voyage schedules, and a system of deferred rebates to compel merchants' loyalty to particular lines, became the order of the day. Not surprisingly the conference provoked vociferous criticism, but the inability of the several governments in South Africa to organize a common response left Currie in charge of the field. His combination of energy, administrative skill, and negotiating talent was such as to win over the German lines and other new challengers in the 1890s and beyond, with the result that the conference repulsed all attackers during his lifetime.<h2>
<a name="DiversificationbeyondshippingdiamondsandsouthernAfrica"></a>Diversification beyond shipping: diamonds and southern Africa</h2>The pursuit of happiness for Donald Currie lay in business competition and diversification. Not only the cut-throat world of steam shipping but the speculative condition of southern Africa's mineral discoveries and urban expansion offered him almost limitless opportunity. One natural extension of his interests lay in linking ship to shore; difficult anchorages and limited port facilities for larger ships led him to set up local landing and boating companies at Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Beira. African Lands and Hotels, established in 1897, was responsible for Cape Town's famous Mount Nelson Hotel. His first venture beyond shipping occurred in 1881, when he acquired some 75 per cent or &pound;19,000 worth of shares in the newly formed Namaqua Copper Company. This gave him a lasting interest in the future of South-West Africa, but his major concerns, like those of so many after 1880, lay in the gold, diamonds and real estate of the Transvaal and northern Cape. Investments in these crucial sectors not only held out the possibility of personal gain; at least as important were the contacts and commercial information they generated, providing Currie with current business and insights into the future development of the passenger and freight trades so vital to his shipping line.<br>
<br>Currie's route into diamonds opened up early in 1886 when, having set up the African Mining Corporation, he used it to make strategic investments in the Kimberley mine, while also investing independently on his own account there, and in the nearby Bultfontein mines. This was a time when the future of diamond mining was seen to lie in the amalgamation of the numerous existing companies, so that production and marketing could be controlled in pursuit of stable, high prices. Currie naturally recognized the principle involved, so akin to that of his shipping conference. He tried but was unable to outmanoeuvre larger or more unscrupulous players, such as Cecil Rhodes and Barney Barnato; however, by a mixture of shrewdness and luck, his shareholdings were such that he emerged in November 1888 as chairman of the London board of the new De Beers Consolidated Mines. He held that position for three years, and remained for many years a director, while also enjoying the huge dividends which De Beers regularly paid in the 1890s.<br>
<br>The attraction of diamonds was rivalled only by the lure of gold. Early in 1887, and working this time through contacts in Natal which handled so much of the Transvaal trade rather than his Cape Town agents, Currie followed a similar approach. He established the African Investment Corporation, again under the control of family and very close friends, and bought up claims. Some were of little worth, but by the mid-1890s his Durban-Roodepoort Gold Mining Company was one of the most productive of all, regularly offering its shareholders dividends between 40 and 80 per cent.<br>
<br>Currie also made investments of a more speculative kind, for instance in exploration companies and Rhodes's British British South Africa Company. They seem to have reflected less material conviction than his need to keep in touch with local developments and to nurture political connections. Rhodes in particular, much as Currie disliked him and refused to join the British South Africa Company's board, was too powerful to be ignored. In a similar way, Currie was drawn into activities associated with the wider partition of Africa. The prospect of rival shipping firms, French, German, Portuguese, or British, invading his sphere from the north on both coasts, as well as foreign annexations, was ever-present after 1880. To prevent this on the west, Currie devoted much energy to supporting both the territorial claims of the Cape government to South-West Africa, and those of the trader Robert Lewis to copper-mining concessions at Otavi. On the east he dabbled with William Mackinnon in schemes to develop the Portuguese territory of Mozambique. On both sides of the continent, he negotiated constantly for mail contracts and government subventions which would help Castle Mail steamers nose northwards, towards Zanzibar, Mauritius, or Luanda. He displayed boundless persistence and ingenuity in devising arguments&#151;about the need for defence, the necessity of stimulating legitimate trade and thwarting foreign ambitions&#151;capable of winning Admiralty or Foreign Office support, and of mortifying the Treasury.<h2>
<a name="Anambivalentreputation"></a>An ambivalent reputation</h2>Currie's reputation was consequently a mixed one. Respected for his business acumen and held up as a contemporary model for emulation, he was simultaneously distrusted by many who had dealings with him; warmly appreciated for his genial hospitality, he was also found unctuous and self-centred. He was described by a director of De Beers as &#145;the Scotch Fox&#146;  (Rothschild archives, B17 Rh), and such epithets, as well as cynical comment about his vanity and social climbing, sat uneasily alongside his always dignified, bearded and increasingly patriarchal appearance. The unscrupulousness which in the 1890s led to a series of libellous but uncontested pamphlets by one former employee stands in marked contrast to the finer feelings of a considerate landlord, consistent churchgoer, and discerning collector of J. M. W. Turner's paintings.<br>
<br>In the 1890s, Currie's relations with public figures in London and South Africa steadily cooled. Personally secure, he had less need to cultivate them, and his cruises carrying the great and the good ceased after Gladstone's last outing to Kiel in 1895. His claims to have the public interest at heart were more than ever regarded as exaggerated and insincere; increasingly, not only merchants but politicians and industrialists found his management of the shipping conference intolerable and his readiness to make terms with German lines a betrayal of British interests. The Cape government's serious attempt to deprive the Castle and Union companies of the mail contract in 1899 was as worrying for Currie as its failure to find an alternative contractor was comforting. He was reaching the limits of his ability to sustain Castle Mail under its existing organization, given the need for extensive rebuilding to meet renewed challenges from his main competitors.<h2>
<a name="CreationofUnionCastleCompany"></a>Creation of Union Castle Company</h2>His response late in 1899 was to go for a merger of Castle Mail and the Union Company. In an agreement marked by his characteristic blend of ingenuity and effrontery, Currie in effect paid the shareholders of the Union Company to allow him to take them over. Early in 1900, on a tide of heady expectations as to its prospects in a prosperous post-war and perhaps federated South Africa, Currie attended the birth of the new Union Castle Company, to be managed like its predecessor by Donald Currie &amp; Co. It was a masterly if flawed achievement, reflecting no particular talent for innovation but demonstrating most tellingly the potential for survival of the small family firm in the face of all the pressures for enlargement of scale in the form of public limited companies.<br>
<br>Its operations Currie now left increasingly to his three sons-in-law whom he had brought into the management agreement in 1896. In the 1890s he had established the London shipping exchange, taken an active interest in the London chamber of commerce, and supported the inclusion of seamen within the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span> of 1897; but in 1900 he retired from parliament and withdrew from any major part in London's shipping world. The one exception to this was his appearance in 1908 before the royal commission investigating shipping rings, where to the last he maintained his uncompromising rejection of all the criticisms levelled at them. It was Currie's last and this time essentially fruitless stand, for the report issued shortly after his death rejected his arguments. Only months later in 1910, the government of the new Union of South Africa, which embodied the federation Donald Currie had always favoured as the region's natural political system, took steps to bring the shipping ring to heel and precipitated the sale of Castle Mail by his heirs.<h2>
<a name="Honoursanddeath"></a>Honours and death</h2>After 1900, Currie spent much more time aboard his steam yacht, cruising with his family among the Scottish isles and in the Mediterranean. He realized some investments, and made several substantial donations, notably to University College Hospital, London, the universities of Edinburgh and Queen's, Belfast, and his old schools. Edinburgh reciprocated with its LLD, the City of Belfast with conferment of its freedom. Strangely, and notwithstanding his visits there in 1887&#150;8 and 1893, there was nothing for South Africa, the source of much of his wealth, either at this time or later in his will. One of the richest men of his day, he died from chronic cystitis and cardiac failure in a nursing home, the Manor House, at Sidmouth, in Devon, on 13 April 1909, survived by his wife and all three daughters. His widow received the king's condolences, his family shared his estate of almost &pound;2.5 million, and he was buried in the churchyard of Fortingal between Garth and Glen Lyon, Perthshire.<br>
