<span class="headword">Palmer,  William Waldegrave</span>, second earl of Selborne  (1859&#150;1942), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 30 Portland Place, London, on 17 October 1859, the only son and the youngest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21210/', "Roundell Palmer (1812&#150;1895)")</script>, politician, who was created earl of Selborne in 1882, and his wife, Lady Laura Waldegrave (<i>d</i>. 1885), second daughter of the eighth Earl Waldegrave. He was educated at Temple Grove, East Sheen, and at Winchester College and he entered University College, Oxford, in 1878, graduating with a first in modern history in 1881. When he was only ten his mother urged him not to forget the family motto &#145;to do my duty in that state of life into which it shall please God to call me&#146;, but although he performed ably enough at school and university, he himself recollected that, while at Oxford, &#145;I hunted and played cards and cricket and tennis and ragged&#151;I took no part in politics&#146;. He was a JP in Hampshire and joined the county militia. He considered a career in the army, but was persuaded by his father to enter politics, gaining administrative experience as private secretary to his father in the Lord Chancellor's Office, and then to H. C. E. Childers, first at the War Office and then at the exchequer, between 1882 and 1884. On 27 October 1883 he married Lady (Beatrix) Maud Cecil [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50054/', "Palmer, (Beatrix) Maud (1858&#150;1950)")</script>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32339/', "Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, the third marquess of Salisbury")</script>; at the wedding, Salisbury gave the bride away, and Gladstone proposed the toast to the bride and groom.<h2>
<a name="Enteringpolitics"></a>Entering politics</h2>When his father was made an earl in 1882 Palmer gained the courtesy title of Viscount Wolmer. He began his political career as a Liberal, standing for the second seat at Coventry and then, in December 1885, winning the Eastern or Petersfield division of Hampshire. Gladstone's conversion to Irish home rule was made public in January 1886, and Wolmer followed his father in opposing it, though not without some misgivings. He decided to vote for the motion by Jesse Collings which turned out Lord Salisbury's administration on 27 January 1886, because in his election speeches he had called on the Liberals to take steps to &#145;multiply the owners of the land&#146;. When he stood as a Liberal Unionist in June 1886 he was supported by Gladstonian Liberals and opposed by Conservatives.<br>
<br>Wolmer joined the newly organized Liberal Unionist Party which sought to play an independent political role. The union was the main issue; but Wolmer warned that it would &#145;rest with the Government [the Salisbury administration] whether we should continue to support them. We cannot entirely abandon our Liberal principles, and support them in reactionary legislation.&#146; From 1886 until his father's death in 1895, Wolmer sat in the Commons. He served as chief whip for the Liberal Unionists, predicting exactly the home-rule majority of forty in 1892. He contested that election in the Edinburgh constituency, mainly because he did not like to compete for his Hampshire seat against Gladstonian Liberals who had been loyal to him in 1885 and 1886. His father's death in 1895 provoked a constitutional issue of whether or not the succession to the peerage necessarily involved forfeiting a seat in the Commons. Selborne and his close friend Lord Midleton had agreed that whoever lost his father first would fight a test case&#151;a select committee found against him. On 3 June 1895 Lord Rosebery's Liberal government fell and the Liberal Unionists ended their independence, taking office in Lord Salisbury's administration. Selborne was offered the post of under-secretary of state for the colonies under Joseph Chamberlain.<h2>
<a name="Colonialandnavalaffairs"></a>Colonial and naval affairs</h2>For the next fifteen years Selborne's career centred on imperial and international affairs: five years in the Colonial Office were followed by a decade divided equally between the Admiralty and the post of governor of the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, and high commissioner for South Africa. He held these key positions at a time when the British empire confronted some of its most dangerous crises: the South African War, the naval race with Germany and other great powers, the making of the South African Union. This was a period whose mood was fairly caught by Rudyard Kipling's poem, &#145;Recessional&#146;; and no one was more aware of the vulnerability of the empire than Selborne. His years at the Colonial Office witnessed a series of vexatious disputes, with the United States of America over Venezuela, Portugal over her African possessions, France over Siam and the upper Nile, and the war with the Boer republics in 1899. This assisted Selborne's rise, for the Colonial Office, formerly a backwater, became central to the assertion of British power. He played a difficult role in the Colonial Office, acting as an intermediary between Lord Milner (who became high commissioner in 1897) and the cabinet, supporting Milner in his defence of British interests, but moderating his impatient desire to bring matters to a head. When war broke out, Selborne was appalled at the catalogue of British military disasters, but he took comfort in the reflection that &#145;we were getting a bit too self-exalted and self-reliant, and therefore &hellip; in this temporary anxiety and humiliation is a merciful discipline&#146;. He prepared a memorandum in November 1899, elaborating his views on the future of South Africa; but his attention was soon focused on another, even more important aspect of Britain's international role. On 27 October 1900 he was offered the post of first lord of the Admiralty, which he described as &#145;the most delectable &hellip; for a British subject after that of prime minister&#146;.<br>
<br>The choice of Selborne as first lord aroused suspicions of nepotism, since he was Lord Salisbury's son-in-law; but he had the administrative and personal gifts essential for the post [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42039', "Hotel Cecil")</script>]. He was methodical, and possessed great powers of concentration&#151;indispensable qualities for the large administrative burden. He had the capacity to get the best out of those responsible to him. He overcame the caution of his first sea lord, Lord Walter Kerr, controlled the exuberance of his House of Commons spokesman, H. O. Arnold-Forster, and released, yet disciplined, the ferocious reforming zeal of Sir John Fisher, who became his second sea lord in 1902 and first sea lord in 1904, reflecting that it was &#145;wholesome for services like the Navy and Army to have occasionally Radicals among their senior officers&#146;.<br>
<br>Selborne first met Fisher in April 1901, when on a trip to the Mediterranean. He was impressed by Fisher's intelligence and quickness of mind, and believed that with careful management he would &#145;run straight&#146;. Under Selborne's supervision, Fisher pushed through the great naval reforms: the planning of the &#145;dreadnought&#146; battleship, the scrapping of obsolete warships, the redistribution of the fleet. Selborne also recognized the need to improve the quality of officer training, and to reduce the social distinction between executive and engineer officers (though this was a less successful reform). He set up a committee on naval reserves, and modernized the navy's technological equipment. The burden of defending the empire was great; and it was increasing at a time, Selborne noted, when Britain's &#145;two-power standard&#146;&#151;committing her to maintain a navy the equal to beating the combined strength of the next two strongest naval powers&#151;was under strain. After 1900 the naval race was joined by Japan and Germany, and this placed an intolerable pressure on British resources. Selborne was among those who believed that the United Kingdom must seek an ally, and, after considering Germany, he supported an agreement with Japan.<br>
<br>Selborne's initial consideration of Germany appears at odds with one of his major policy decisions&#151;the redistribution of the fleet, and its concentration against a potential threat in the North Sea. But as early as 1902 he admitted to A. J. Balfour that he had not realized &#145;the intensity of the hatred of the German nation to this country&#146;. If Britain was to retain her naval pre-eminence, then she must deploy her resources according to the German threat. Moreover, she must not remain a great power, but become a greater one: this meant placing the empire at the centre of her foreign policy, seeking to strengthen its bonds, perhaps even moving towards imperial federation.<h2>
<a name="SouthAfrica"></a>South Africa</h2>In February 1905 Selborne was finally persuaded to leave the Admiralty and replace Lord Milner in South Africa. He went out of a sense of duty, for the Unionist government was moving towards its inglorious close, and defeat in the next general election was anticipated. Balfour resigned in December 1905, and Selborne found himself serving under Lord Elgin and then Lord Crewe, Liberal colonial secretaries who were not always in sympathy with his aims. He was obliged to defend Lord Milner's policy of employing Chinese labour in the Transvaal, and he opposed the government's decision to grant full responsible government to the former Boer republics, seeking to mitigate the impact of this (as he saw it) rash policy by influencing the West Ridgeway committee's decision on the distribution of seats. This earned him the cabinet's censure, and he considered resigning; but Selborne's greatest quality was his resilience. No sooner did the Transvaal and Orange River Colony gain responsible government than he was planning his next move, which was to lend his carefully concealed support to a group of young imperialists, led by Lionel Curtis, who were planning to federate all the South African states. This, they believed, would attract enough British immigration to secure South Africa for the British empire. Selborne presided over the production of &#145;the egg&#146;: the &#145;Selborne memorandum&#146;, which was published in July 1907 ostensibly as a result of an initiative from South African politicians. In October 1908 a National Convention assembled to settle the economic and political future of South Africa.<br>
<br>Selborne intervened on several key issues: the future of the protectorates of Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland; the native franchise; and the voting formula for the new state. His overriding concern was to reconcile the first two of these interests with the need for South African unity; and to ensure that a united South Africa would be dominated by the British. He hoped to place the protectorates under the new state, but with trusted administrators appointed to run them, thus eliminating the British House of Commons from interference. He struggled to keep an &#145;open door&#146; for a native franchise; but neither he, nor the Liberal government, was prepared to jeopardize union on this question. Selborne <i>was</i> prepared to jeopardize union on the question of the white franchise, defending a voting system based on each MP representing roughly the same number of voters (which gave the British the advantage) rather than the same number of people (which worked to the advantage of the Afrikaners). Eventually a compromise was reached, by which proportional representation (which Selborne favoured) was abandoned, but the voters' basis retained, and the constitution amended to require that all bills intended to change the electoral system should be submitted to the crown for approval.<br>
<br>Selborne left South Africa in April 1910, convinced that he had saved it for the empire. But he and his young federalists, and indeed the Liberal government, hardly realized the deeper levels of the politics of that country. The union was agreed because each side thought they would gain the upper hand. The Afrikaners saw it as the chance to work for a position of domination, albeit most of them accepted that this domination could be reconciled with membership of the British empire.<h2>
<a name="Britishpoliticsagain"></a>British politics again</h2>When Selborne returned to England in 1910 he did so convinced that the House of Commons was no fit body to run a great empire. He saw all domestic questions from an imperialist perspective. This explains his apparently contradictory behaviour between 1910 and 1914, when he fought bitterly to defend the House of Lords against the Liberal government's determination to remove its veto, while advocating the use of the referendum on constitutional matters, and a federal Ireland to reconcile the competing claims of Ulster Unionists, Irish nationalists, and the British empire. Overall, an imperial government was needed &#145;responsible to all the electors of the Empire and with power to act directly on individual citizens&#146;. This would help maintain Britain as an imperial nation for it would, combined with Joseph Chamberlain's policy of imperial preference, pay for social reform, which Selborne acknowledged was naturally a priority for the working man.<br>
<br>Selborne's cordial relations with certain Liberals were strained to breaking point before 1914. He greeted the declaration of war in August 1914 with grim resignation; but his mood soon turned to further disillusionment with Asquith's government over its conduct of the war. In May 1915 the Liberals offered a coalition which the Unionists, whatever their misgivings, could hardly refuse. Selborne became president of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. He displayed his usual vigour and organizational skills, and within a few months of his appointment he had persuaded Lord Milner to chair a subcommittee to examine the possibility of stimulating an increase of foodstuffs. By July 1915 an interim report (recommending a guaranteed minimum price for wheat) was ready, but was shelved. Selborne's concern over the failure to establish an effective co-ordinating body to wage war increased his frustration; in October 1915 he nearly resigned. In June 1916 he finally left the cabinet over Lloyd George's conduct of negotiations between Sir Edward Carson and John Redmond following the Easter rising in Dublin in April 1916. But, again, Selborne's position was more complex than it first appeared. He was concerned that any Irish settlement should only be made in the context of the future constitution of the United Kingdom and the empire. To this end he co-operated with F. S. Oliver in advocating a federal solution, seeking to achieve for Ireland what he believed he had given to South Africa, and using similar methods of persuasion. Selborne and Oliver worked hard to influence the Irish Convention of 1917&#150;18, but this came to nothing because of poor chairmanship by Sir Horace Plunkett, the stern opposition of the Ulster Unionists, and the indifference of the British government, especially of Lloyd George.<br>
<br>Selborne's administrative gifts were given further scope, however, on his appointment as chairman of the agricultural policy subcommittee of the reconstruction committee which in 1917 supported his advocacy of state interventionist policies, including a minimum wage for farm labourers, guaranteed wheat prices, and powers to enforce good cultivation&#151;measures embodied in the <span class="roman">Corn Production Act</span> of 1917. In 1919 he was elected chairman of the joint committee of both houses of parliament on the bill to carry out the recommendations of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford report on the government of India, but he entertained grave doubts about the efficacy of seeking to impose Western style government on an Asian nation. His deep interest in ecclesiastical matters was given scope in a report by the archbishops' committee on church&#150;state relations which Selborne chaired from 1913, and which in 1917 recommended the introduction of what became the church assembly. The <span class="roman">Enabling Act</span> of 1919, based on this report, still left final power in the hands of the crown and parliament. But Selborne's dislike of a political world dominated by Lloyd George was increasing. He refused the offer of the viceroyalty of India, and of Ireland, and the offer of a marquessate. He watched with growing concern the rise of trade union power, and he was appalled at the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921. In 1924 he caused a sensation when he broke his silence on the question of what had been promised to the Ulster Unionists when the Lloyd George cabinet was drawing up the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span> of 1920, revealing that Walter Long had pledged that the boundaries of Northern Ireland would remain inviolate, except for very slight adjustments which might prove desirable. Selborne wrote frequently to the press on public issues. He advocated women's suffrage, which he had supported since 1910, and reform of the House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>In these years also Selborne filled a number of congenial posts, including the office of lord high steward of Winchester from 1929 until his death, and warden of Winchester College from 1920 to 1925. He was chairman of the house of laity in the church assembly from 1924. In 1905 he was made a GCMG, and he was given the Order of the Garter in July 1909 in recognition of his South African work. He was an elder brother of Trinity House from 1904. He received the honorary degree of LLD from Cambridge in 1910 and DCL from Oxford in 1911.<br>
<br>Selborne's home life was a particularly happy one. He relied heavily on the support of his wife, corresponding freely with her on important issues in South African politics between 1905 and 1910. They had three sons and one daughter; their second son, Robert, was killed in action in Mesopotamia in 1916. Selborne died at his home, 14 Buckingham Palace Gardens, London, on 26 February 1942, and was buried in the family grave at Blackmoor churchyard, near Liss, in Hampshire. He was succeeded by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31525/', "Roundell Cecil Palmer (1887&#150;1971)")</script>, who had just been appointed minister of economic warfare in Winston Churchill's government.<br>
