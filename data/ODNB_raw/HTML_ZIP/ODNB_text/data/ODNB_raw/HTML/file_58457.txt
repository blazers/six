<span class="headword">Wyatt,  James</span>  (1690/91&#150;1767), <span class="occ">merchant and shipbuilder</span>, was born in the Hythe area of Southampton and probably in that part of Hythe then in the parish of Dibden. Details of his parents are obscure; however, Wyatt is known to have had one elder brother, Joseph (<i>c</i>.1689&#150;1757). Throughout his life James was to work closely with his brother, the two often involved in joint business enterprises. An early reference to Joseph appears in 1719 when he supplied boards for the gates of Beaulieu church, while in 1726 he supplied timber for a quay being built on Beaulieu River. This latter was part of the failed Montagu Town scheme in which John, second duke of Montagu, hoped to establish a major port to receive produce from plantations in the West Indies.<br>
<br>During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740&#150;8) the quay was put to use by the Wyatt brothers, who jointly exported timber out of the New Forest, supplying both compass oak and treenails to the naval dockyard at Portsmouth. While Joseph continued to concentrate upon the supply of timber, acquiring rights on a number of properties throughout the New Forest, James directed his attention towards the building of ships. As the war placed considerable pressures upon existing government dockyard facilities, the Admiralty increasingly turned to private shipbuilders for the construction and repair of smaller warships. Although having no direct experience of such work, Wyatt was closely connected with the most important commodity of the shipbuilding process, that of timber. In possession, also, of certain entrepreneurial skills, he used both his knowledge of the Beaulieu area and recent experience of supplying the Admiralty to secure a shipbuilding contract and a site upon which the vessel could be built. The site chosen was Buckler's Hard, this being part of the failed Montagu Town site and secured from the duke of Montagu at a rent of &pound;5 per annum. James Wyatt was thus the first shipbuilder to make use of this historic site which remains the property of the Montagu family and is little changed since the days of Wyatt's enterprise.<br>
<br>The contract secured from the Admiralty was for a 24-gun ship that was to be launched in 1745 as the <i>Surprise</i>. Overseeing construction of this vessel, the Admiralty appointed a senior naval dockyard shipwright, Henry Adams, with Wyatt having to recruit the necessary workforce. In 1746 Wyatt acquired a second Admiralty contract, the <i>Scorpion</i> (18 guns), also built at Buckler's Hard. Despite the success of the shipbuilding venture no further contracts were obtained, the Admiralty preferring to direct all new work to its own facilities now that exigencies of war had declined. In March 1748 the yard was taken over by Henry Adams. James Wyatt returned to the supply of timber, the will of Joseph Wyatt, read in 1757, noting that he possessed at least one messuage (in Fawley). Wyatt, who died in September 1767, left four children born to his first wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1729), and a further two children of his second wife, Hannah King (<i>d</i>. 1786), whom he had married in Fawley parish church on 4 February 1732. James Wyatt was buried (5 September) with his brother at Dibden; the site of the grave is marked by a magnificent tomb that depicts a ship, and declares James to have been seventy-six years of age at his death.<br>
