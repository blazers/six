<span class="headword">Smith,  Norman  Kemp</span>  (1872&#150;1958), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born Norman Duncan Smith in Dundee on 5 May 1872. He did not use his middle name (his mother's maiden name) but after his marriage in 1910 to Amy Kemp (<i>d</i>. 1936), a schoolteacher, daughter of Francis Kemp, banker, of Manchester, he adopted her maiden name, and thereafter was always known as Norman Kemp Smith. He was the youngest of six children of Andrew Watson Smith, cabinet-maker, and the only one in his family to have a university education. He was educated at Dundee high school and Harris Academy, Dundee, and entered the University of St Andrews in 1888, where he studied classics and philosophy under such teachers as Lewis Campbell, John Burnet, Andrew Seth, William Knight, and Henry Jones. After graduating MA with first-class honours in mental philosophy and winning the Ramsey and later Ferguson scholarships, he spent a year in Jena before becoming assistant to Sir Henry Jones in moral philosophy in Glasgow. After further study in Germany, he returned to Glasgow as assistant to Professor Robert Adamson in logic and rhetoric. Adamson, a Kantian scholar and critical philosopher, was to have a great influence on him. In 1902 Smith published <span class="italic">Studies in the Cartesian Philosophy</span>, which gained him the DPhil degree from St Andrews. In 1906 he went as professor of psychology to Princeton, and in 1914 was elected McCosh professor of philosophy there. In 1916 he returned, on leave, to Britain, where, until the end of the war, he served in the Ministry of Information. His <span class="italic">Commentary to Kant's &#145;Critique of Pure Reason&#146;</span> appeared in 1918, and in the following year he was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh, a post he held until his retirement in 1945.<br>
<br>In 1924 Kemp Smith published his <span class="italic">Prolegomena to an Idealist Theory of Knowledge</span>. In 1934 his translation of Kant's first <span class="italic">Critique</span> appeared, and some said that even German scholars found it easier to read Kant in Kemp Smith's translation than in the original German. In 1935 he edited, with a lengthy introduction, Hume's <span class="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</span> (2nd edn, 1947), followed, in 1941, by his great work, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of David Hume</span>. This seemed to have completed his major published work, whose power and consistency establish him as one of the greatest Scottish philosophers of the twentieth century. However, he returned to the subject of his doctoral thesis and, at the age of eighty produced a new volume, <span class="italic">New Studies in the Cartesian Philosophy</span> (1952). Only in one of his published works is he presenting his own thought. In all of the others he is developing it in critical appreciation of earlier philosophers. Yet of his book on Hume it could be said: &#145;The resulting critical account of Hume's philosophy is no less modern a contribution to thought than any other book of our age&#146;  (J. Keay and J. Keay, eds., <span class="italic">Collins's Encyclopaedia of Scotland</span>, 1994, 774). In 1967 three of his former students (A. J. D. Porteous, R. D. Maclennan, and G. E. Davie) edited and contributed to a memorial volume of his collected papers, <span class="italic">The Credibility of Divine Existence</span>.<br>
<br>In 1917 Kemp Smith attended in London a lecture by Baron Friedrich von H&uuml;gel entitled &#145;Religion and illusion&#146;, which became the starting point for a remarkable friendship and correspondence between the Scottish philosopher, whose religious background was Presbyterian and Calvinist, and the Roman Catholic layman, twenty years his senior. The correspondence continued until von H&uuml;gel's death in 1925, and has been edited by Lawrence F. Barmann as <span class="italic">The Letters of Baron Friedrich von H&uuml;gel and Professor Norman Kemp Smith</span> (1981). The spiritual character of his quest for truth is evident in these letters, as is his respect for Calvin and his view of sin. Yet he remained outside the church. In part this was due to his understanding that a professor of philosophy has a responsibility not to seem to commend a particular religious viewpoint.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Prolegomena to an Idealist Theory of Knowledge</span> (1924) attempted, as Kemp Smith put it, &#145;the formulation of an idealist theory of knowledge on realist lines&#146;  (preface, ix). &#145;Idealist&#146; in the title is used in a particular sense, as opposed to &#145;naturalist&#146; that is, it holds that &#145;spiritual values have a determining voice in the ordering of the Universe&#146; and do not simply emerge with evolution  (p. 1). Kemp Smith's epistemology was not idealist in the more normal sense. He developed it, as he himself said, &#145;on realist lines&#146;. He rejected the doctrine of representative perception and the subjectivism of both Descartes and Berkeley. He has been described as &#145;critico-realist&#146;. Knowledge is not accumulated by adding fact to fact. It develops and changes as we learn to criticize our illusions, our assumptions, in the light of new evidence or experience. In the same way, the history of ideas is not an inevitable progression. As his pupil and friend Professor G. E. Davie has suggested, the depth of his thought came from the Calvinist doctrine of original sin in contrast to the shallow optimism of the idea of progress  (Davie, 46&#150;61). He saw that to understand and interpret other philosophers one must see them in their historical context. His own interpretations of Descartes, Kant, and especially Hume showed that his critical method could bring them to contemporary life, and throw fresh light on old difficulties. He had little patience with those who reduced philosophy to &#145;language games&#146;.<br>
<br>Kemp Smith was a powerful force in the struggle of the Scottish universities in the 1920s to maintain a general, philosophical base to university education against pressure towards early specialization on the English model. Following the Scottish tradition he taught his own general class and each year hundreds of students learned the excitement of philosophical thinking from his rapid-fire lectures and dictated notes. He fired them with his own enthusiasm, and with many it lasted through life. With his honours classes, on the other hand, he preferred the seminar, where he was the listener to their weekly papers, gently disciplining their thought and encouraging them to follow where their ideas led. When A. E. Taylor was ill, and for a term he took the moral philosophy honours class as well as his own, he produced Reinhold Niebuhr's <span class="italic">An Interpretation of Christian Ethics</span> and had the class study and criticize that.<br>
<br>Although a large presence, Kemp Smith was a shy man with little small talk (&#145;Kemp Smith does not converse, he discourses&#146;, said one student after having tea with him). Yet he became close to his honours students, who all revered him, as did his assistants and lecturers. He kept finding new things in literature as well as in philosophy and shared his enthusiasm for a new book with students and friends. &#145;Sell your bed and buy it!&#146;, he would say. He learned to drive a car at the age of sixty-six, and one of his students remembers the engine almost stalling on a steep hill while the distinguished philosopher encouraged it by rocking back and forward behind the steering wheel instead of engaging a lower gear. The sudden death of his wife on 16 December 1936 was a great grief. Although she did not share all his intellectual interests, theirs was a deeply affectionate partnership. Their only daughter, Janet, was very close to her father, and it was a joy to him when, in 1938, she married Dr Martin Ludlam, a member of a Quaker family. From 1940 to 1946 they were in India, but after their return, to Carlisle, he was able to take pleasure also in his grandchildren.<br>
<br>In 1920 Kemp Smith received the honorary degree of LLD from St Andrews, and in 1930 he was made honorary DLitt of Durham. Glasgow conferred its honorary degree of LLD on him in 1951. In 1921 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1924 became a fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>In 1957 Kemp Smith experienced a black-out and spent some time in hospital. The problem later recurred, and his last months were spent at 41 Drummond Place, an Edinburgh nursing home, where he died on 3 September 1958. He was cremated at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 6 September.<br>
