<span class="headword">Cargill,  David Sime</span>  (1826&#150;1904), <span class="occ">merchant and oil industrialist</span>, was born at Maryton, near Montrose, on 9 April 1826, the fourth and youngest son of the nine children of James Cargill, farmer, and his wife, Helen Thomson. After a brief exposure to office life in Glasgow, he spent the years 1844 to 1861 in Ceylon, building up the trade of a Scottish firm of East India merchants and establishing a Colombo department store that became known as the &#145;Harrods of the East&#146;. When he returned to Glasgow, Cargill was wealthy enough to buy out his employers, and in 1861 to marry advantageously. His wife was Margaret (1840&#150;1872), daughter of Dr John Traill of Arbroath. Three sons and two daughters were born to them before she died in 1872.<br>
<br>By the 1870s Cargill had immersed himself in a venture that was to become his life's work: the commercial exploitation of Burmese oil. In 1876, after visiting Burma, he purchased the Glasgow-based Rangoon Oil Company Ltd, which had failed because the king of Upper Burma used his monopoly power to overcharge for the crude oil that was to be found in his dominions. Over the next ten years Cargill supported the loss-making downstream activities from his own pocket, to the extent of &pound;100,000. Then, in 1886, after the Third Burmese War, the British authorities annexed Upper Burma, and granted him prospecting licences in the oilfields there. Cargill introduced machine drilling and had the Rangoon refinery modernized to cope with the increased production. When in July 1886 he founded a new company, the Burmah Oil Company, his Glasgow associates were highly sceptical about its prospects. Yet in the final year of his life, 1904, it made &pound;264,000 net profit and sold more than 2 million barrels of oil products, two-thirds of which comprised the cheap kerosene which kept Burmese and Indian lamps burning.<br>
<br>People who knew Cargill attributed his achievements to his combining certain conflicting qualities rarely to be found together: great courage with great caution, and broad vision with an unquenchable passion for detail. A sufferer from chronic insomnia, he often worked far into the night. Cargill had an impressive and well-tailored presence, enhanced by a Roman nose, broad forehead, and large beard. He was an active figure in Glasgow's inner commercial and public counsels, from the chamber of commerce, the Merchants' House, and the Clyde Trust to the council of the Royal Institute of Fine Arts and the Glasgow Maternity Hospital. However, Cargill's single-mindedness and lack of consideration exacted a high price from others. His managing director, Kirkman Finlay (1847&#150;1903), doggedly worked for seventeen years in London with no effective support, before suffering a breakdown and killing himself. Although in 1878 Cargill was married again&#151;to Connel Elizabeth Auld, with whom he had a son and a daughter&#151;his innate reserve and general busyness clearly stunted his family's emotional lives. Two of the sons never married, one died an alcoholic, and his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46808/', "Sir John Cargill")</script>, never lost the diffidence he had acquired as a child.<br>
<br>David Cargill died of paralysis at Carruth, Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, near Glasgow, on 25 May 1904. He was survived by his second wife and left a movable estate worth &pound;943,000, two-thirds of which represented his stake in the Burmah Oil Company.<br>
