<span class="headword">Peacocke,  Joseph Ferguson</span>  (1835&#150;1916), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born at Abbeyleix, Queen's county, on 5 November 1835. He was the youngest son of George Peacocke MD of Longford and his wife, Catherine Ferguson. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated as senior moderator in history and English literature in 1857, also gaining a first-class divinity <i>testimonium</i> and winning the political economy prize for his year. Ordained deacon in 1858 and priest in 1859, he held his first curacy at St Mary's, Kilkenny, where he served from 1858 until 1861. He then became secretary of the Hibernian Church Missionary Society, a position which he held for two years. A strong evangelical, he was a firm supporter of foreign missions and of the Church Missionary Society in particular. In 1863 he went to Monkstown, co. Dublin, as curate of the parish church. In 1865 he married Caroline Sophia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Irvine); they had one daughter and four sons, the eldest of whom was bishop of Derry from 1916 until 1945. Peacocke stayed in Monkstown until 1873, when he was appointed rector of St George's, Dublin, an important city parish. In 1878 he was recalled to Monkstown, where he had made himself popular with the parishioners, and remained as rector there until he was raised to a bishopric. Along with his benefice he held for a few months in 1894 the professorship of pastoral theology in Trinity College, Dublin, a post to which he was well suited.<br>
<br>In 1894 Peacocke, who had proceeded DD in 1883, was elected to the diocese of Meath, succeeding Charles Parsons Reichel as bishop. In 1897 he was translated to the archbishopric of Dublin, a post which he took over from William Conyngham, fourth Baron Plunket. No archbishop of Dublin for 200 years had previously held a cure of souls in the diocese; and Peacocke's reputation among the clergy for tolerance, holiness, and varied pastoral experience had preceded him. He presided with dignity over the dioceses of Dublin, Glendalough, and Kildare, publishing some charges and occasional sermons, and serving as a select preacher at Dublin and Cambridge, until 1915, when he resigned his see owing to ill health. He died at Hastings, Blackrock, co. Dublin, on 26 May 1916; his memorial tablet in Kildare Cathedral declared him to have served faithfully, humbly and with holiness (&#145;Pastor fidelis, humilis, et sanctus corde&#146;). Peacocke was said to have been a man of fine presence, who commanded respectful attention in synod and at the pulpit. A portrait by P. A. de L&aacute;szlo, presented by the diocese, was later housed in the palace at Dublin.<br>
