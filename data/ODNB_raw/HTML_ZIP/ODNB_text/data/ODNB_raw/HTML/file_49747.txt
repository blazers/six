<span class="headword">Buchanan,  James</span>  (1696&#150;1758), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born and baptized on 31 May 1696, the second of four sons of Archibald Buchanan of Drumhead in the parish of Cardross, Dunbartonshire, a minor Scottish laird, and his wife, Jannet Anderson. It was common for the younger sons of lairds thereabouts to be put into trade, and, like his eldest and youngest brothers, Buchanan's initial career was as a merchant in Glasgow. He may have spent some time in America at the beginning but, if so, he soon returned to Glasgow. In 1725, when he was twenty-nine, he was one of the original members of the Buchanan Society of Glasgow, which was founded to provide for poor members of the clan Buchanan, and is described in their records as a merchant of Glasgow. Scottish firms in Virginia needed London correspondents for commercial and banking services and by 1727 Buchanan had settled in the capital, where he acted at first for the Glasgow firm of John Luke &amp; Co., major tobacco importers. He was soon a respected figure in the London Virginia trade, if never himself a tobacco importer of the first rank. In his later years he was the London financial agent of Lieutenant-Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia and a member of the policy committee of the London association of merchants trading to the Chesapeake. In the latter capacity he participated in negotiations with the secretary of state, William Pitt, and other ministers on matters relating to their trade and navigation.<br>
<br>While his Glasgow kin engaged in a direct trade to the Chesapeake through stores maintained there, Buchanan in London was a merchant factor, acting on commission for principals in Virginia who consigned him tobacco for sale, and drew bills of exchange on him for the proceeds or authorized him to make purchases for them of return goods. Only half his correspondents were planters, the remainder being mostly country merchants. His planter correspondents were a select group, including many with names prominent in Virginia, while at least three-fifths were justices of the peace or higher officials. However, his dealings with country traders were more substantial. After his death, more than 70 per cent of the sums owing to his firm in Virginia was from merchants. Buchanan's activity in this cargo trade with American merchants placed his among the more progressive houses in the London Chesapeake trade. In addition to his Virginia business, Buchanan developed some West Indies trade in his last years. In 1756 he was also one of the bondsmen or guarantors for the army forage contract of Richard Oswald, a fellow Glaswegian migrant to London. Such sureties usually had a financial interest in the contract guaranteed.<br>
<br>Buchanan at various times had places of business in Mincing Lane, Mark Lane, and Crutched Friars in the south-east corner of the City. In addition he possessed a country residence in Highgate. He married Jane Crichton on 17 October 1733 in Dunstable; they raised a son, Archibald, and two daughters, Jane and Rebecca. Finding himself in ill health and his only son still a minor, in December 1757 Buchanan reorganized his business as James Buchanan &amp; Co., a partnership involving himself (with a half share), John Hyndman (a third), and Richard Lancaster (a sixth). Lancaster had been his chief clerk, while Hyndman, a Scot, had been in business at Smithfield in southern Virginia, corresponding with Buchanan and some of the Glasgow Buchanans. Less than a year after this reorganization, Buchanan died at his country residence at Highgate on 24 August 1758. By his will, a third of his estate went to his widow, a third to his son, and a sixth to each of his two daughters. Since his daughter Jane's portion was &pound;10,000 when she married in 1762, it seems likely that Buchanan's total estate was in the vicinity of &pound;60,000, of which only a tenth was invested in the capital of his new firm. Hyndman capably managed the affairs of that concern (in which Buchanan's estate retained its half interest) and expanded both its general turnover and its activity in the West Indies. The old partnership was wound up after 1768, though Hyndman and Lancaster continued a similar business in partnership with Thomas Main (Hyndman's nephew) and Robert Bunn. The firm lasted under Main until about 1810.<br>
