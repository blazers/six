</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Palairet, Sir  (Charles) Michael</span>  (1882&#150;1956), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 29 September 1882 at Berkeley, Gloucestershire, the second of three sons of Charles Harvey Palairet, army officer, of Westhill, Ledbury, Herefordshire, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henry. He was descended from a French family called Palayret who had fled initially to the Netherlands when Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes in 1689. Subsequently the family lived in England. In Palairet's lifetime the family name was best known for the cricketing ability of his older cousins, L. C. H. and R. C. N. Palairet. On his mother's side he was a great-grandson of Thomas Allan, the mineralogist.<br>
<br>Palairet was educated at Eton College, and then went to Touraine to improve his French and to Weimar to improve his German. He joined the diplomatic service in 1905, and after serving the usual probationary period in the Foreign Office was posted to Rome in 1906. In 1907 he was promoted from attach&eacute; to third secretary, and in 1908 he was transferred to Vienna, a posting which provided useful experience for his later time there. On 29 June 1915 he married Mary de Vere, daughter of Brigadier-General Herbert William Studd, commanding officer of the Coldstream Guards. They had one son and one daughter. In 1916, while posted to Paris, Palairet and his wife were received into the Roman Catholic church. They were to remain staunch Catholics for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>Soon after arriving in Paris in 1913 Palairet had been promoted to second secretary, and in 1917 he was sent to Athens (where he was later to be ambassador). A second period in Paris followed during the peace conference (1918&#150;19), and later in the embassy, after which Palairet was briefly transferred to the Foreign Office, which in those days was quite distinct from the diplomatic service. Palairet's progression through the ranks of the diplomatic service resumed with his posting to Paris as first secretary, as a replacement for Nevile Henderson. He then served variously in Tokyo, during the catastrophic earthquake of 1923 which destroyed the embassy, and in Peking (Beijing) and Rome. As an experienced middle-rank diplomatist, Palairet then became minister to Romania in December 1929. Here their charm and hospitality and keen interest in Romanian culture won the Palairets a wide circle of friends. Prince Carol, who returned from exile and became king in 1930, showed no grudge at having been requested to leave England in 1928 because of his alleged involvement in a plot to place him on the Romanian throne. Good Anglo-Romanian relations, both political and commercial, were established, but German economic and political penetration had become menacing before Palairet left for Stockholm in 1935.<br>
<br>All this was preparation for the most important posting of Palairet's career, which was to Vienna in December 1937. He spent only a few months there, but this period coincided with the overthrow of the independent Austrian republic in March 1938. Palairet's reporting to the Foreign Office was robust. He told of how Hitler had &#145;raved like a madman&#146; at the unfortunate Chancellor Schuschnigg in their notorious interview in February 1938  (<span class="italic">Documents on British Foreign Policy</span>, 2/19, no. 50), and admired the chancellor's courage in calling a plebiscite over the issue of Austrian independence. He advised the foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, that it was pointless to send a message to Schuschnigg disclaiming any British responsibility for encouraging a plebiscite. In Palairet's opinion it would &#145;not have done any good&#146;, even though he was sympathetic to the plight of the Austrian government, because Austria was doomed  (Palairet to Halifax, 11 March 1938, TNA: PRO, R2478/137/3&#150;22315). Palairet reported that Austrians constantly told him that Britain was their last hope, but there was never any possibility of British intervention to prevent the <i>Anschluss</i>. Subsequently, however, he believed that Schuschnigg's decision to hold the plebiscite was mistaken. Following the <i>Anschluss</i> the British legation in Vienna was closed, and Palairet was recalled to London. In June 1938 Palairet's work in Vienna was recognized by his appointment as KCMG and in September&#150;December he took charge of the British legation in Bucharest during the illness of Sir Reginald Hoare.<br>
<br>In June 1939 Palairet went as minister to Athens, a welcome appointment. Yet again his period of service was to coincide with a Nazi invasion, in April 1941, following the unsuccessful Italian attack in October 1940. But his diplomacy did not impress his American colleague MacVeagh, who found him intellectually limited, lackadaisical, and in comparison with his predecessor Sir Sydney Waterlow &#145;as a .22 calibre target pistol to a bell-mouthed blunderbuss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambassador MacVeagh Reports</span>, 163). The Foreign Office did not share this perception of Palairet, and he retained his accreditation to the Greek government in exile, being promoted ambassador in 1942. He retired in April 1943, but returned to the Foreign Office as a temporary assistant under-secretary, dealing with matters concerning prisoners of war. He remained in this post until July 1948.<br>
<br>Palairet never secured an embassy in the diplomatic &#145;magic circle&#146; of Paris, Berlin, Washington, and Moscow. In his retirement he indulged an interest in the translation of German religious books. He died at his home, Lynch Mead, Allerford, Minehead, Somerset, on 5 August 1956.<br>
<br>Palairet's only daughter, <a name="cosubject_70986"></a><span class="headword">Anne Mary Celestine Asquith</span>, countess of Oxford and Asquith  (1916&#150;1998)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 14 November 1916 in Paris and educated in Bucharest, Paris, and elsewhere, and at St Anne's College, Oxford (1936&#150;9), though she did not take her final examinations. During the Second World War she worked at Bletchley Park, then joined the WAAF and tracked German air raids. In 1945 she was posted to Palestine and narrowly escaped death when the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was blown up. She married on 28 August 1947 Julian Edward George Asquith, second earl of Oxford and Asquith (<i>b</i>. 1916), colonial official, the eldest son of Raymond Asquith (1878&#150;1916); they had two sons and three daughters. She accompanied her husband on postings to Libya, Zanzibar, St Lucia, and finally the Seychelles, where Asquith was governor (1962&#150;7), before they retired to the Manor House, Mells, Frome, Somerset. Lady Oxford was described by contemporaries as beautiful, intelligent, enthusiastic, and interested in the arts. She died on 19 August 1998 at Frome, Somerset, survived by her husband and their five children.<br>
