<span class="headword">Higgons, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1623/4&#150;1691), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born in Shropshire, the son of Thomas Higgons (<i>b</i>. 1563/4, <i>d</i>. in or before 1640), rector of Westbury, Shropshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1656), daughter of Richard Barker of Haughmond Abbey. He matriculated from St Alban Hall, Oxford, on 27 April 1638, aged fourteen, and later resided at Merton College with his tutor, fellow Edward Corbet. On 4 February 1640 he was admitted to the Middle Temple. Subsequently he returned to Shropshire, though it is unknown whether he fought for either side during the civil war. Between about 1643 and 1646 he made a voyage to Italy; after his return to England, in 1647 or 1648 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Paulet, and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7566/', "Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex (1591&#150;1646)")</script>, the parliamentarian general. They lived at Greywell, and during the marriage two daughters, Elizabeth and Frances, were born. After his wife's death in 1656, Higgons delivered and later published <span class="italic">A Funerall Oration Spoken over the Grave</span> (1656) defending her against charges of adultery and other censures. In 1658 he published, as <span class="italic">A Prospective of the Naval Triumph of the Venetians over the Turk</span>, a translation of an Italian work by G. F. Busenello.<br>
<br>In 1659 Higgons represented Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in parliament, where he spoke in favour of recognizing Richard Cromwell as lord protector, allowing the Scottish MPs to remain in the house, and maintaining the <i>status quo</i> in general. Though he participated in this and other debates, his role was not prominent. At the Restoration he published <span class="italic">A Panegyrick to the King</span> (1660), in which he exhorted Charles II to save England's &#145;sinking State&#146; and to rule like Augustus and Trajan. This work won him the praise of Edmund Waller. In the Cavalier Parliament, as MP for New Windsor, Berkshire, Higgons soon distinguished himself as a firm supporter of the king by arguing in favour of his exclusive control of the militia. He argued that the power of the king was fully compatible with the liberty of the people, and he added that the civil wars would never have happened if the king's power over the military had not been contested. In total he served on 178 committees, chairing seven, acted as teller in fifteen divisions, and made twenty-two recorded speeches, one of which, on the militia, was published (1661). For his services the crown awarded him in 1663 an annual pension of &pound;500 and a knighthood. In November 1661 he married Bridget Leach (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11487/', "Sir Bevil Grenville")</script>, sister of the recently created earl of Bath, who had been instrumental in the Restoration, and widow of Simon Leach of Cadleigh, Devon. Over the years they had three sons, George, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65474/', "Thomas Higgons (1668/9&#150;1733)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13240/', "Bevil Higgons (1670&#150;1736)")</script>, and three daughters, Grace, Jane, and Bridget. Sir Thomas also maintained his literary interests, publishing <span class="italic">Ode upon the Death of Mr Cowley</span> (1667) in celebration of the recently deceased poet, Abraham Cowley.<br>
<br>In 1665 Sir Thomas was involved in a diplomatic mission to Paris and in 1668&#150;9 he travelled to Dresden to deliver the Order of the Garter to the elector of Saxony. From 1674 to 1677 he served as the English envoy in Venice, where he probably wrote much of his most substantial literary work, finally published in 1684 as <span class="italic">The History of Isuf Bassa, Captain General of the Ottoman Army at the Invasion of Candia</span>, which concerned a Turkish tragic hero in the war against the Venetians in the 1640s. When he returned to England during the onset of the Popish Plot, he was identified in <span class="italic">A Seasonable Argument</span>, published at Amsterdam in 1677, as the recipient of &pound;4000 in gifts from the crown and as one of those &#145;who have betrayed their country to the conspirators, and bargain'd with them to maintain a standing army in England, under the command of the bigotted popish D[uke] who &hellip; hopes to bring all back to Rome&#146;. Though he defended the duke of York in the exclusion crisis, he also sat on parliamentary committees to protect the protestant religion. He chose not to participate in the Exclusion Parliaments but was elected MP for St Germans, Cornwall, in 1685 and served on three committees in James II's parliament. After the king's flight he maintained his loyalty, though unlike his sons Thomas and Bevil he did not become a Jacobite and follow the monarch into exile.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1691 Sir Thomas died from apoplexy in the court of king's bench while acting as a witness for the earl of Bath's claim to the duke of Albemarle's estate. He was laid to rest in Winchester Cathedral on 3 December, near the remains of his first wife. According to his will he had outstanding debts of &pound;4650 but also claims to &pound;1640 in reimbursement for his expenses on his mission to Venice.<br>
