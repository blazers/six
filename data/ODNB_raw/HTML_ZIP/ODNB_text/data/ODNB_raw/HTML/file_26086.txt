<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sparrow,  Anthony</span>  (1612&#150;1685), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was born in 1612 at Depden, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the son of Samuel Sparrow, and baptized on 7 May at nearby Wickhambrook. He matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1625, graduated BA in 1629 and proceeded MA in 1632. He was a junior fellow by 13 February 1633, and was ordained priest at Ely on 22 February 1635. On 24 June 1637 Sparrow preached <span class="italic">A Sermon Concerning Confession of Sins and the Power of Absolution</span> (1637), in which he made the typically Laudian claim that priests might hear confession and pronounce absolution, with the proviso that God would actually absolve only the truly penitent. Insisting that the individual must accept responsibility for sin, without blaming God, nature, or the devil, Sparrow's sermon effectively advanced the idea of free will, and was too far distant from Calvinist predestinarian doctrine to be regarded as simply Arminian. It has been persuasively argued that it should be regarded instead as one in a rapidly growing number of frankly papist theological and sacramental pronouncements made from various quarters within the university at this time. Within two weeks of preaching the sermon was in print. Contemporaries were outraged, but Sparrow remained untouched, evidently enjoying at least the tacit protection of Archbishop William Laud's press censors, and perhaps the bishop of London himself, William Juxon.<br>
<br>Sparrow was Hebrew praelector from 1638 to 1639, with a stipend of &pound;5 per annum, and proceeded BD in 1639. In 1640&#150;41, however, Sparrow and a number of his contemporaries at Cambridge came under the scrutiny of a parliamentary committee set up to investigate religious innovations at the universities. Despite his close association with the scandalous disclosures of popish doctrine and adornments corrupting a number of colleges and their chapels Sparrow remained at Queens'. He was Greek praelector, 1640&#150;41; Hebrew praelector again in 1642&#150;3; bursar, 1640&#150;42; censor theologicus and examinator, 1641&#150;2; and censor philosophicus, 1642&#150;3. But on 8 April 1644 he fell victim to the parliamentarian purge of the university. He was ejected from his fellowship by the orders of Edward Montagu, second earl of Manchester, for non-residence and failure to comply with a summons to return to his college.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1645 Sparrow married Susanna Orrell (<i>d</i>. in or after 1693) at Withersfield, Suffolk. On 30 September 1647 he was instituted to the rectory of Hawkedon, near Depden, but he was ejected within five weeks for using the proscribed <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. In 1655, shortly after a protectoral proclamation was issued upholding the prohibition of the prayer book, Sparrow published, anonymously, his <span class="italic">Rationale upon the Book of Common Prayer</span> which described and justified the liturgy in every detail. Undoubtedly a courageous publication Sparrow's book formed a direct answer to the denigration that had been heaped upon the prayer book and renewed the confidence of the adherents of orthodox usage. Sparrow also formulated a cogent theology of morning prayer in terms of access to the presence of God which gave the daily service a clear purpose and articulated its basic theological structure. The <span class="italic">Rationale</span> subsequently went through perhaps as many as eight editions before Sparrow's death, and enjoyed a minor revival in the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1660 Sparrow was reinstated as rector of Hawkedon, and was also elected to a preachership at Bury St Edmunds. On 7 August he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Sudbury. On 31 August Sparrow, with Thomas Fuller and other eminent loyalists, graduated DD from Cambridge at the express command of the king. On 15 April 1661 he was appointed to the second prebendal stall at Ely. That year he also published <span class="italic">A Collection of Articles, Injunctions, Canons of the Church of England</span>, constructed broadly to evince that the reform of the church had been, and rightly ought to be &#145;orderly and synodical&#146; and because Sparrow felt that &#145;without a definitive and authoritative sentence, controversies will be endless, and the churches peace unavoidably disturbed&#146;  (1671 edition, preface). But for Sparrow it seems that there would be little escaping the disturbance of the peace, whether that of the church or of the college to which he had now returned.<br>
<br>In 1662 Charles II and Clarendon bore down heavily on the majority of fellows at Queens', who had elected Simon Patrick to be their president, preferring Sparrow for the position instead. Patrick took the matter before the court of king's bench. He eventually withdrew from the contest to take up the benefice of St Paul's, Covent Garden, offered him by William Russell, earl of Bedford, but not before the king and his ministers had shown &#145;the lengths to which [they] were prepared to go to defend the interests of the high churchmen within the university&#146;  (Gascoigne, 35). As vice-chancellor of the university in 1664&#150;5 Sparrow himself sought to intervene on behalf of the king's chosen candidate for a fellowship at Trinity Hall. He was also ever vigilant for the spread of religious heterodoxy within the university, showing no interest whatever in the case for latitude or moderation.<br>
<br>Sparrow's reward for his services at Cambridge came in 1667 with his promotion to the see of Exeter, where he was consecrated on 3 November. From 1668 to 1676 he also held the archdeaconry of Exeter and the sinecure deanery of St Buryan. Sparrow's episcopacy was characterized by deep concern at the growth of dissent. His primary visitation charge, preached in a sermon at Truro, was published in 1669 as <span class="italic">The Bishop of Exons Caution to his Diocese Against False Doctrines</span>. The indulgence of 1672 seems to have come as something of a betrayal, Sparrow complaining to Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon: &#145;I see daily to my heart's grief the poor sheep committed to my trust snatched out of the fold by cunning wolves and I know not how to bring them back&#146;  (Spurr, 63).<br>
<br>In 1676 Sparrow was transferred to the no less difficult, but considerably more valuable, see of Norwich. The city was descending at that time into a period of factional conflict which one contemporary compared with pardonable exaggeration to that between Guelphs and Ghibellines in medieval Italy. Sparrow's appointment probably contributed to the polarization of opinion between the church and crown loyalists who had welcomed the appointment of Lord Yarmouth as lord lieutenant in 1675, and the sizeable nonconformist minority fearful of the rising tide of aggressive Anglicanism. However, before long Sparrow appears to have found himself caught in the crossfire between the extremists of the tory and whig parties. He found &#145;some clamouring loud against me for prosecuting schismatics, and some who profess great loyalty and zeal for the church, as loud complaining because we do not proceed violently beyond the rule of law&#146;  (Spurr, 82). Sparrow died at the episcopal palace at Norwich on 19 May 1685; a monument and inscription mark the spot where he lies buried in the nearby chapel. In his will he left &pound;100 to the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral, &pound;100 to Queens' College, and smaller sums to Norwich Cathedral and the widows and orphans of diocesan clergy. His widow and sole executor was still alive in 1693. They had numerous children, three daughters marrying dignitaries of Exeter Cathedral.<br>
