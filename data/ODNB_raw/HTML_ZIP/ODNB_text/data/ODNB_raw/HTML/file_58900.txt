<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petre,  (Edward Oswald) Gabriel  Turville-</span>  (1908&#150;1978), <span class="occ">Icelandic scholar</span>, was born on 25 March 1908 at Bosworth Hall, Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire, younger son of Lieutenant-Colonel Oswald Henry Philip Turville-Petre (1862&#150;1941), high sheriff of Leicestershire, and his wife, Margaret Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cave (<i>d</i>. 1954). He was educated at Ampleforth College and in 1926 entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he read English, taking a third in 1930, before working for a research degree (BLitt, 1936). After some years spent teaching and studying in Iceland, Germany, and Scandinavia, he returned to Oxford as Vigf&uacute;sson reader in ancient Icelandic literature and antiquities in 1941. He held this post, having been given the title of professor in 1953, and elected to a studentship of Christ Church in 1964, until his retirement in 1975. He also held honorary appointments at the universities of Leeds, London, and Melbourne. In 1943, he married Joan Elizabeth Blomfield (<i>b</i>. 1911), herself a distinguished scholar in the field of Old Norse&#150;Icelandic studies, and they had three sons.<br>
<br>Gabriel Turville-Petre became interested in Iceland and its medieval literary culture when still a child, and his links with Iceland, both professional and personal, remained strong throughout his life. He formed close friendships with Icelandic scholars, among them Einar &Oacute;lafur Sveinsson, who wrote an affectionate memoir in the Festschrift for Turville-Petre's seventieth birthday, praising his command of modern Icelandic, his devotion to Icelandic culture, and the contribution he made to the growth of Icelandic studies in Britain. He was lektor in English in the University of Iceland, 1936&#150;8, and served also as British pro-consul in Reykjav&iacute;k during this time. In 1956 he was awarded the title of officer of the order of the Falcon, and commander in 1963, prestigious honours conferred by the president of Iceland, and received honorary degrees from the universities of Iceland (1961) and Uppsala (1977). He was elected FBA in 1973.<br>
<br>Turville-Petre's achievement and influence as a scholar of Old Norse&#150;Icelandic studies can hardly be overestimated. One of the earliest of a large number of articles in scholarly journals, his &#145;Notes on the intellectual history of Icelanders&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 27, 1942) was a decisive intervention setting straight the vague misconceptions then current among English-speaking scholars about Icelandic literacy and scholarship after Iceland's conversion to Christianity in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1000. Turville-Petre definitively dispelled romantic assumptions about late Germanic pre-literacy in Iceland, and his piece remains an authoritative summary of early Icelandic literary history. His edition of <span class="italic">V&iacute;ga-Gl&uacute;ms saga</span> (1940), based on his BLitt thesis, drew on what was already a remarkable range of learning, especially with regard to textual criticism (demonstrating the complex literary prehistory of a saga which had been both shortened and lengthened before being written down in its extant form), pagan religion, and Icelandic topography, which he had explored first-hand during his many visits to Iceland.<br>
<br>Turville-Petre's later works reflect these strengths. His <span class="italic">Myth and Religion of the North</span> (1964) is the best account of Old Norse&#150;Icelandic mythology in English, especially valuable because it presents a comprehensive survey of mythological references in Icelandic and related literatures without attempting to impose narrative pattern or religious cohesion on the material. <span class="italic">The Heroic Age of Scandinavia</span> (1951) is a similarly compendious and judicious account of a period whose sources mostly date from much later times, and derive from fictionalized texts. But his major contribution to Old Norse&#150;Icelandic studies is his <span class="italic">Origins of Icelandic Literature</span> (1953; 2nd edn, 1967), in many ways an expansion of his 1942 article on Icelandic intellectual history, which seeks to show the roots of Icelandic saga writing&#151;one of the most remarkable literary phenomena of the middle ages&#151;in the earliest Christian literary productions of medieval Iceland. In its epilogue, his measured assessments of what constitutes excellence in the Icelandic canon have formed the taste of generations of later readers.<br>
<br>Knowledge of Irish and Welsh, in addition to medieval and modern Icelandic, other Scandinavian languages, and German, enabled Turville-Petre to draw illuminating parallels between early Celtic verse, especially the poetry of the Irish <i>filid</i>, and Old Norse&#150;Icelandic <i>dr&oacute;ttkv&aelig;tt</i>, the intricate and cryptic court poetry which flourished in Iceland and Norway from about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 800 to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1200. Articles published throughout his career, some bringing together these two difficult kinds of early poetry, and others formulating his conviction that the literary qualities of skaldic verse might have particular appeal for late twentieth-century readers, culminated in his anthology of skaldic verse, <span class="italic">Scaldic Poetry</span> (1976). This volume too is an impressive blend of his scholarly gifts&#151;the careful editing of often corrupt strophes, with translations and explanatory notes&#151;and, in his choice of poets and poems, his opinion-forming authority, born of a lifetime's study of and delight in this literature.<br>
<br>A selection of Turville-Petre's papers was published as <span class="italic">Nine Norse Studies</span> (1972) and presented to him by the Viking Society for Northern Research, of which he was an honorary life member, and whose scholarly journal, the <span class="italic">Saga Book</span>, he had jointly edited for many years. The papers in <span class="italic">Nine Norse Studies</span> give a good indication of the range and quality of his scholarship. Notable among them are pieces on the poetry of the Icelandic skald G&iacute;sli S&uacute;rsson, on the cult of &Oacute;&eth;inn, and his still celebrated &#145;On the poetry of the scalds and of the filid&#146;, translated from an Icelandic version first published in 1954.<br>
<br>During his career at Oxford, Gabriel Turville-Petre was the influential teacher of many generations of Old Norse&#150;Icelandic scholars. His command of the subject was such that his students only had to listen to learn, but although his authority was extraordinary, he was always courteous and kindly, and never derided the shortcomings of either his students or other scholars in the field. None the less, his standards were deeply rigorous and he expected from his students the absolute commitment to scholarship he had himself. He died on 17 February 1978, of cancer, at The Court, The Croft, Old Headington, Oxford, his home since 1948. At Oxford, an annual prize for distinguished work in Old Norse&#150;Icelandic studies by a graduate or undergraduate is given in his name, and the room which houses the university's collection of books in the subject is named after him.<br>
