<span class="headword">Simson,  Harold  Fraser-</span>  (1872&#150;1944), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at 3 Dawson Place, Kensington, London, on 15 August 1872, the son of a flourishing merchant, Arthur Theodore Simson (1840&#150;1924), and his Scottish wife, Jane Anne Catherine Fraser (1850/51&#150;1913), of Reelig. Educated mostly in France, but also at Charterhouse School and King's College, London, he operated as a commercial shipowner from an office in Mincing Lane, while at the same time turning his hand to composing light music in a dilettante way. He married, in 1897, May Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bucknall, with whom he had a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1911 Fraser-Simson wrote the musical score, to a colourful if conventional text by the striving stage writer Walter Wadham Peacock, for a comic opera called <span class="italic">Bonita</span>, and organized a syndicate to produce it in the West End. Several well-known artists were hired to take part, but Simson's coup was the securing of the avant-garde director H. Granville Barker to stage the piece. <span class="italic">Bonita</span> was not a success, but its music was well received, and thus, five years later, when Howard Talbot and Paul Rubens proved unavailable to set the new libretto by an unknown author being prepared by Bobbie Evett for Daly's Theatre, Simson (some said, at the price of an investment) was offered the job. His score to Freddie Lonsdale's text for <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span> (1916, including &#145;Farewell&#146;, &#145;Love will Find a Way&#146;, and &#145;Husbands and Wives&#146;) made him famous.<br>
<br>His reputation secure, as the composer of one of the biggest musical-theatre successes of the era, Simson subsequently supplied Evett with the scores for two other vehicles for the star of <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span>, Jos&eacute; Collins&#151;the splendidly successful <span class="italic">A Southern Maid</span> (1917) and a Peg Woffington musical, <span class="italic">Our Peg</span> (1919). The latter was initially frozen out of the West End because of the success of its long-running predecessors, but it later played at the Gaiety in a revised form as <span class="italic">Our Nell</span> (1924) with the star as Nell Gwynne.<br>
<br>The composer had less joy with a touring musical called <span class="italic">Missy Jo</span> (1921) and a vehicle for the comedian W. H. Berry, <span class="italic">Head over Heels</span> (1923), but he scored another fine success when he returned once again to themes costume and romantic and teamed once more with Lonsdale on a musical about artists in Montmartre, <span class="italic">The Street Singer</span> (1924). Phyllis Dare purchased the show and had it mounted as a vehicle for her talents, and it ran for nearly a year at London's Lyric Theatre before going round the country. Thereafter Simson wrote only one further musical play for the West End stage, a charming light romantic piece based on Hastings Turner's <span class="italic">The Lilies of the Field</span>, which was produced in 1925 under the title <span class="italic">Betty in Mayfair</span>, with Evelyn Laye featured. However, four years later he supplied the music to A. A. Milne's adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's classic <span class="italic">The Wind in the Willows</span>, which was produced at Liverpool as <span class="italic">Toad of Toad Hall</span>. The little show established itself as a perennial favourite, and more than half a century later it was still regularly produced in Britain as a children's Christmas entertainment. The composer achieved one more, posthumous, stage credit when, in 1970, Julian Slade adapted Milne's <span class="italic">Winnie the Pooh</span> to the stage with his song cycle <span class="italic">The Hums of Pooh</span> as its musical part.<br>
<br>Simson married secondly, in 1919, (Anna) Cicely <i>n&eacute;e</i> Devenish. Latterly he lived in London and the family seat at Dalcross Castle, Croy, Inverness-shire, where he died on 19 January 1944.<br>
