<span class="headword">Pierce <span class="st"> [Pearse]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1630/31&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Wales; the names of his parents are as yet unknown. He joined the predominantly Welsh membership of Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 December 1650, graduating BA on 10 March 1655 and proceeding MA on 25 June 1657. He received Anglican ordination when he was ordained priest by Thomas Morton, bishop of Durham, in August 1659. He may have become rector of St Michael, Crooked Lane, London, in the late 1650s (as Anthony Wood's fitfully accurate account claimed), but if so his career soon moved to Northamptonshire under the patronage of the wealthy City merchant and Northamptonshire landowner, Sir John Langham of Crosby Place, Bishopsgate and Cottesbrooke, Northamptonshire. Pierce acted (but was never formally instituted) as vicar of St Sepulchre's, Northampton, between 1660 and 1663 and in December 1662 was instituted to the vicarage of Duston. He resigned the latter the following year when he became rector of Aldwincle All Saints and rector of Cottesbrooke. His first wife, Lucy, was buried at Cottesbrooke on 21 June 1665; within the year, on 17 May 1666, Pierce married Elizabeth Langham (1632/3&#150;1705), niece of his patron, Sir John. Pierce and his second wife had two sons and five daughters, of whom one daughter died in infancy.<br>
<br>Pierce's writings began with an account of the fire of 1675 at Northampton and ended with another work spurred by local circumstances, <span class="italic">Christ Alone our Life</span> (1691), a sermon preached to the prisoners condemned at Northampton assizes in September 1690. His most significant engagement with contemporary debates came in the early 1680s with a series of anonymous works written against the persecution of dissent. His <span class="italic">The Conformists Plea for the Nonconformists</span> was first published in 1681 and went through two more editions over the next two years; Pierce expanded on its theme in three further pleas, the second and third published in 1682, the fourth in 1683. Pierce urged that nonconformists should be accorded toleration and insisted that they were not responsible for the execution of Charles I in 1649. Richard Baxter's <span class="italic">Apology for the Nonconformists' Ministry</span> appeared in 1681, and Pierce's corresponding assertions earned him the reputation, especially among ecclesiastics, of a dangerous, treacherous controversialist. Most notably, the court preacher Robert South was referring to Pierce when he denounced in a sermon &#145;all the Pleas and Apologies for the Nonconformists (tho' made by some Conformists themselves)&#146; as &#145;senceless and irrational&#146;  (South, 6.33, 63).<br>
<br>Anthony Wood in <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> partly confused Pierce with the ejected minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21703/', "Edward Pearse (d. 1673)")</script> and ascribed works to the former written by the latter. The men were not only effectively namesakes, given the interchangeability of spellings in the seventeenth century (though both the one work that he published under his own name and his will make clear that Pierce was how the Anglican clergyman spelt his own name) but shared a publisher, Jonathan Robinson.<br>
<br>Pierce's position in <span class="italic">The Conformists Plea</span> and its sequels mirrored his own practice as pastor. In December 1687 Pierce explained to Richard Baxter how, despite his personal opposition to separation, he &#145;never discouraged any of my people from hearing any NonConformist minister&#146;. Ever since he had come to Cottesbrooke he had &#145;ventured upon known hazzards, in point of tendernes&#146; towards those of his parishioners uneasy at some of the rites of the Church of England: in all those years he had never worn the surplice when administering communion and he had often omitted the sign of the cross during baptism. &#145;I allwayes &hellip; preached the great things of Christianity, &amp; never medled with dissents&#146;, he wrote and described his care in regulating admission to communion: the unworthy he turned away, while new communicants were admitted after due instruction and &#145;upon declared Confession to walk according to their Baptismal Covenant&#146;. By late 1687 Pierce had become concerned with the spread of separatism among nonconformists; in his parish &#145;the late yeares of Tory-prosecutions&#146; had weakened his attempts to keep his nonconformist parishioners in communion with the Church of England and strengthened the appeal of local separatist preachers  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.293). In his fervently devout will Pierce chose to identify himself in terms which emphasized what he shared in common with other protestant pastors rather than what separated him from some, and described himself not as a clergyman of the Church of England but rather as &#145;the most unworthy minister of the Gospell of God my Saviour&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/423, fol. 234<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Pierce died on 2 September 1694 at Cottesbrooke rectory, aged sixty-three, and was buried in the chancel of the church two days later. His widow, Elizabeth, who died on 4 August 1705, aged seventy-two, was buried in the same grave. Pierce was succeeded as rector of Cottesbrooke by his eldest son, John.<br>
