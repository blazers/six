<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  Charles, of Carr</span>, first baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1789), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was descended from a younger son of William Douglas of Lochleven, sixth earl of Morton. The record only begins with his passing his examination for lieutenant in the British navy in February 1747, having attracted the attention of Admiral Francis Holburne who in 1757 described him as a &#145;good clever sensible man&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/481, fol. 467). From 1749 to 1752 he served as a lieutenant in the Dutch navy (admiralty of Amsterdam). He was promoted to that rank in the Royal Navy on 4 December 1753 and on 24 February 1759 he was made commander. He served through that summer in command of the armed ship <i>Boscawen</i> attached to the fleet under Sir Charles Saunders during the capture of Quebec.<br>
<br>In 1761 Douglas had command of the <i>Unicorn</i> (28 guns) attached to the squadron employed in blockading Brest, and in 1762 he was in charge of the <i>Syren</i> (20 guns) on the coast of Newfoundland, where he commanded the naval force which covered Lieutenant-Colonel William Amherst's landing at Torbay on 13 September. He was still in the <i>Syren</i> at the peace, and when transferred to the <i>Tweed</i> (32 guns) was able to ensure that James Cook could complete his survey of St Pierre and Miquelon before those islands passed to the French. In 1764 and 1765 he served as a flag officer in the Russian navy. From 1767 to 1770 he commanded the <i>Emerald</i> (32 guns), and from 1770 to 1773 the <i>St Albans</i> (64 guns), both on the home station. In 1775 he was appointed to the <i>Isis</i> (50 guns), and was sent with reinforcements and stores for Quebec, then threatened by American rebel forces commanded by Benedict Arnold. He did not reach the coast of America until too late in the season; the St Lawrence was closed by ice, and he was obliged to return without having effected the object of his voyage. He was again sent out early in the next year, and, pushing through the ice with great difficulty, arrived off Quebec on 6 May. The town, which had been closely blockaded during the winter, was relieved, and the governor, assuming the offensive, drove the enemy from their entrenchments in headlong flight. Douglas then proceeded to construct a squadron of small vessels on Lake Champlain, with which he defeated Arnold's flotilla in the battle of Valcour Island (11&#150;13 October 1776). On his return to England, Douglas was rewarded with a baronetcy on 23 January 1777. A few months later he was appointed to the <i>Stirling Castle</i> (64 guns); in her he took part in the action off Ushant on 27 July 1778. In the subsequent courts martial his testimony was distinctly to the advantage of Admiral Augustus Keppel.<br>
<br>Douglas was afterwards appointed to the <i>Duke</i> (98 guns), and commanded her in the Channel Fleet for the next three years; during this time he experimented with moving standards from the gun decks, in order to open greater arcs of fire, thereby enabling several ships to engage a single target at a quarter mile range, or a single ship to engage several. He also introduced improvements in gun tackles and equipment which significantly increased rates of fire.<br>
<br>Douglas was selected by Sir George Rodney towards the end of 1781 as his first captain or captain of the fleet, accompanied him to the West Indies on board the <i>Formidable</i>, and was with him in the battle of the Saints on 12 April 1782. The claim, recounted years later by Admiral Sir Charles Dashwood, who had been a midshipman on the <i>Formidable</i>, that Douglas persuaded Rodney to make the decisive tactical movement to cut the enemy battle line, is doubtful, and Brian Tunstall largely accepts Samuel Hood's criticism of Douglas's failure as Rodney's staff officer to ensure that the older man's weakness of memory was overcome. In particular Hood criticized Douglas's failure to support Hood's efforts to persuade Rodney, who was exhausted after four sleepless nights, to order &#145;general chase&#146; in the pursuit of De Grasse following the battle  (Tunstall, 113&#150;20). Captain Thomas White, who dismissed the claim for Douglas, also reported that when the <i>Formidable</i> was passing the <i>Glorieux</i>, and pouring in her a tremendous broadside at very close range, Douglas exclaimed: &#145;Behold, Sir George, the Greeks and Trojans contending for the body of Patroclus&#146;; to which Rodney replied, &#145;Damn the Greeks, and damn the Trojans; I have other things to think of&#146;. Later, the story goes, he returned to Douglas and said, smiling, &#145;Now, my dear friend, I am at the service of the Greeks and Trojans, and the whole of Homer's &#145;Iliad&#146;; for the enemy is in confusion and our victory is secure&#146;. White said that the remark attributed to Douglas was &#145;in perfect accordance with his usual style of expression&#146;, and &#145;the answer to it is agreeable to that of Sir George Rodney&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Researches</span>, 112). To set against the tittle-tattle is Douglas's real and very important contribution to the victory provided by his gunnery innovations, which had been approved by the Admiralty in the early months of 1781, and at Rodney's instructions had been introduced into some at least of the ships under his command.<br>
<br>When Rodney was recalled Douglas remained with Admiral Hugh Pigot as captain of the fleet, before returning to England at the peace in 1783. In October he was appointed commodore and commander-in-chief on the Halifax station, but in 1786 he asked for his recall when the Admiralty would not support him in a dispute with the dockyard commissioner, Henry Duncan. On 24 September 1787 he was promoted rear-admiral, and in January 1789 he was again appointed to the command in North America.<br>
<br>Douglas was married three times. His first wife was Lydia Schimmelpinck; the couple produced two sons and a daughter, the eldest son, William Henry, inheriting as second baronet. His second marriage was to Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1779), daughter of James Wood, who gave birth to a daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7888/', "Howard Douglas")</script>, who subsequently inherited the title as third baronet, and became inspector of artillery. Major-General Sir Howard Douglas was the chief advocate for his father's claims at the battle of the Saints, and served a term as governor of New Brunswick. His third marriage was to Jane Baillie. Douglas died suddenly of apoplexy in early February 1789 as he was about to take up his command in North America.<br>
