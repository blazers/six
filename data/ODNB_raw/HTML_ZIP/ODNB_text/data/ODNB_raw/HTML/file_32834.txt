<span class="headword">Dines,  William Henry</span>  (1855&#150;1927), <span class="occ">meteorologist</span>, was born on 5 August 1855 at 74 Charlwood Street, Pimlico, London, the only surviving son (two daughters also reached adulthood) of George Dines (1812&#150;1887), builder and meteorologist, and his wife, Louisa Sara Coke of Norfolk. George Dines's father, Charles, gamekeeper to the Whitbread family, had been murdered by a poacher and the Whitbreads retained an interest in the welfare of the Dines family. George Dines was apprenticed to the building firm of Thomas Cubitt, rising to become foreman of works at Osborne. His meteorological interests probably arose out of his building work, and may have encouraged similar interest in his son.<br>
<br>Dines was educated at Woodcote House School, Windlesham, Surrey, then articled as an engineering pupil at the Nine Elms Works of the London and South Western Railway. After completing his articles in 1877 he went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he passed the mathematical tripos in 1881 as twentieth wrangler. He remained in residence as a mathematical coach for a year after graduation, but his retiring nature and spare constitution did not fit him for a teaching career, though he continued to offer mathematical tuition by correspondence. He married, on 3 January 1882, Catharine Emma (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), daughter of Frederick Tugwell, a clergyman. Two of their sons later became notable meteorologists. As he had private means Dines was able to devote himself to the study of dynamical and physical meteorology. He became the leading exponent of experimental meteorology in England at the turn of the century, and his work in anemometry, the upper air, solar and terrestrial radiation, and the structure of the atmosphere was particularly notable.<br>
<br>The collapse of the Tay Bridge in 1879 led engineers and builders to raise questions about the maximum wind pressure tolerance of structures, and meteorologists to face the problem of how to relate wind velocity and force to the corresponding pressures. The Royal Meteorological Society commissioned a wind force committee in June 1885 to examine the matter. Dines was one of the most active members, his colleagues being William Marcet, the society's president, the instrument makers William Ford Stanley and R. W. Munro, and, from the Meteorological Office, R. H. Scott, secretary, and Captain Toynbee, superintendent.<br>
<br>Dines used his engineering skills to devise an anemometer that would be independent of friction, and to compare alongside each other various types of anemometer. On this latter task he collaborated with G. M. Whipple, superintendent of Kew observatory. Having failed to persuade any railway company to allow instruments to be fixed to a speeding locomotive, they set up their experiments on a steam powered whirligig in the Dines's family garden. Their results were jointly published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> and in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society in 1888. After several years of development with Munro's instrument engineering firm, Dines produced the pressure tube anemometer. This robust instrument achieved widespread and international popularity, the type having more than eighty years of active life after its original conception.<br>
<br>Although of independent means Dines was far from isolated. Interest in his work was sustained through his reports to the annual meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, his membership of meteorological committees, and his circle of friends from university days. For a study of the effect of exposure on the readings of wind pressure recorders Dines collaborated with Captain D. Wilson-Barker, who took the observations over a two-year period on HMS <span class="italic">Worcester</span> for their 1899 paper. Six years later he devised a micro-barograph in association with William Napier Shaw. Another longtime friend was Lewis Fry Richardson, the father of analytical forecasting.<br>
<br>Elected president of the Royal Meteorological Society for 1901 and 1902, Dines encouraged the society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science to support upper air investigations. He himself began to develop lightweight instruments that could be suspended from large box kites. These required a considerable expanse of open countryside for safe operation, as they were attached to steel wire that could be several miles long. Firstly at Pyrton Hill, then from Benson Observatory in Oxfordshire, he took copious measurements of the upper air and coupled them with the results from balloon experiments to investigate the newly discovered stratosphere. His ideas formed the basis for theories concerning variations in atmospheric pressure on account of processes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The effects of this linkage are known to this day as the Dines compensation.<br>
<br>Dines applied the same mix of experimental skill and theoretical grasp to the problem of the heat balance of the earth and the atmosphere. During the early years of the First World War he had attempted to establish a balance sheet for solar radiation; the outcome was the development of an instrument for measuring night-time radiation.<br>
<br>His home at Benson became one of five weather stations to submit daily weather reports to the Meteorological Office in London. It also remained a focus for family life, one of his two meteorologist sons being married there in 1915, and one of his grandchildren in 1937. In his later years he succumbed to Parkinson's disease, leaving the running of the observatory to his son Lewen. He died at Benson on 24 December 1927. He was survived by his wife.<br>
