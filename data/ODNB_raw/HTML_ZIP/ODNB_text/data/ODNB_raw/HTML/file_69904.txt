<span class="headword">Guthrie,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1582), <span class="occ">civic administrator and religious activist</span>, is first recorded on 10 January 1549, when he was admitted burgess and guild brother of Edinburgh. Nothing is known of his parentage or education. He became a lawyer who also engaged in trade, and was appointed common clerk of Edinburgh, probably in 1553. Although his own activities among Edinburgh's growing circle of protestants in the 1550s are not recorded, his wife, Janet Henryson (or Henderson), was one of the group of wives of influential burgesses with whom John Knox corresponded while in exile in Geneva. She was addressed as his &#145;beloved sister&#146; in a letter of March 1558  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 4.247).<br>
<br>In April 1559 Guthrie's career became embroiled in controversy, when he was arrested by the Catholic provost George, fifth Lord Seton. Later Guthrie was sent, along with the protestant minority group on the town council, to negotiate with the lords of congregation when they reached the capital in June 1559. Along with Adam Fullarton and Alexander Clark he became one of the most consistent of the &#145;better sort&#146; who relied on the &#145;amity&#146; with England. He was a regular informant for the English ambassador, Thomas Randolph, from at least October 1560 onwards. To his Roman Catholic enemies he was known as King Guthrie  (Lynch, 24). As such he took a leading role alongside Knox in the consolidation of Edinburgh's reformation by the new regime, brought to power by a coup in 1559&#150;60.<br>
<br>Guthrie's role in the government of the town increased through his continuous presence on the burgh council between 1561 and 1565. From 1562 he was also dean of guild, with responsibility for oversight of the burgh church of St Giles, for which Knox was first minister, and he was a member of the kirk session in 1561&#150;2, the only year before the 1570s for which session records exist. Holding both burgh and political office simultaneously was unusual. It gave Guthrie a central place in the affairs of the capital in these years. He did not scruple to become involved in conspiracy and violence. He was one of the four &#145;captains&#146; of protestant armed bands arrested for drilling in the royal park near the palace of Holyroodhouse in July 1565, shortly before the abortive coup led by James Stewart, earl of Moray. His connections with Edinburgh's legal establishment and with key protestant dissidents within the royal administration were demonstrated by the appearance in court as one of his sureties of Patrick Bellenden of Stenness, brother of the justice clerk John Bellenden of Auchnoull. In 1556 Guthrie had acted as godfather to one of the children of another influential legal family, the Bannatynes, which was in turn closely connected to the Bellendens.<br>
<br>In 1566 Guthrie was implicated in the murder of the queen's servant David Riccio. After fleeing with two prominent conspirators who both held high office, Bellenden of Auchnoull and James McGill, clerk register, Guthrie was outlawed and replaced as town clerk by a royal nominee, David Chalmers, despite a formal protest by the town council. The fact that he was among the last of the Riccio conspirators to be granted a remission, in December 1566, when he was also restored to office, confirms his prominence in the affair. His subsequent career was less colourful. He continued as town clerk until his death on 23 August 1582, though he had briefly been charged with treason for failing to leave the burgh for some six months after its occupation by the queen's party in April 1571; but he successfully denied presiding over meetings of the burgh court during that time. Although Guthrie again served on the council in 1576&#150;8, his final years seem to have been spent largely in the burgh archives in his care; the earliest records of the burgh, dating from 1403, exist only as a partial transcript devised under his supervision in 1579&#150;80. Guthrie was succeeded in office by his son, Alexander. His wife, who survived him, did not lose her radical opinions in her old age. She was exiled from the capital along with the wives of the burgh's exiled dissident ministers, in the autumn of 1584. She lived until 1600.<br>
