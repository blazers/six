<span class="headword">Gee,  Thomas</span>  (1815&#150;1898), <span class="occ">newspaper publisher and politician</span>, was born at Denbigh on 24 January 1815, the second son of Thomas Gee (1780&#150;1845), printer, and Mary Foulkes of Hendre'r-&#373;ydd, Denbighshire. He was educated at Grove Park School, Wrexham, and Denbigh grammar school; at fourteen he was apprenticed to his father, though he continued to attend the grammar school to read Greek and Latin with the masters there. In 1836, having finished his apprenticeship, he spent two years in London working at the offices of the publishers Eyre and Spottiswoode, before returning to his father's business in Denbigh in 1838.<br>
<br>At this time Gee seriously contemplated a career as a preacher. In 1837 he wrote to his parents &#145;it is my wish to employ my talent (which I know is but very small) to the glory of God&#146;  (Gwynn Jones, 54) and began to preach with the Calvinistic Methodists. In 1838 he became a member of this connection's Denbighshire monthly meeting, of which he was to remain a member for the rest of his life, taking an especial interest in education and Sunday schools. Any thoughts Gee might have had of a career in the ministry, however, were terminated in 1845 when his father died, leaving him in sole charge of the family business. On 11 October 1842 he had married Susannah (<i>b</i>. 1817), daughter of John Hughes, Plas Coch, Llangynhafal, Denbighshire. They had six daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55199/', "Sarah Magdalene Matthews")</script>, and three sons.<br>
<br>Gee's success as a publisher was the basis for the great influence he enjoyed in nineteenth-century Wales. His success was based on expansion of the business&#151;he was described as a &#145;publisher&#150;wholesaler, printer, binder, newspaper proprietor, stationer and retail book-seller&#146;  (P. H. Jones, 30)&#151;and stemmed from a number of factors. In part, he was able to exploit his denominational connections: for example, he published the official hymnbook used by all Calvinistic Methodists before 1876. However, he was also alert to developments in the market for Welsh-language texts, and put himself in a position to supply it with a wide range of general religious books, collections of sermons by famous preachers, and poetry. Although his methods did not make him popular with everyone&#151;he fell out badly with some of his authors&#151;his motivation was by no means the simple pursuit of profit. From early publishing ventures such as the innovative quarterly <span class="italic">Y Traethodydd</span> (which he published from 1845 to 1854), to the massive Welsh-language encyclopaedia <span class="italic">Y Gwyddionadur</span> (1858&#150;78), the total cost of which exceeded &pound;20,000&#151;Gee aimed deliberately to educate his compatriots through the medium of their native tongue.<br>
<br>Perhaps Gee's most successful publishing venture, however, came in 1857, when he saw an opening in the market for a weekly Welsh-language newspaper. He told a friend that he planned a family paper &#145;of a superior class &hellip; of a distinctly religious character &hellip; and as liberal in its politics as you please&#146;  (P. H. Jones, 110). On 4 March 1857 <span class="italic">Baner Cymru</span> (known as <span class="italic">Baner ac Amserau Cymru</span> after its merger with the Liverpool-based title <span class="italic">Yr Amserau</span> in October 1859) was launched. <span class="italic">Baner</span>, with its highly talented staff, among whom were such luminaries of mid-Victorian Welsh politics as John Griffith (Y Gohebydd), became the most authoritative newspaper in the Welsh language&#151;what one contemporary called &#145;the mightiest regenerating engine in our country&#146;  (J. Davies to T. Gee, 24 July 1865, NL Wales, Gee MSS, 3305 D/41). Gee's influence pervaded its pages, and it was said that he checked all copy before it went to press, as well as writing many of the leading articles. Under his editorship <span class="italic">Baner</span> defined the agenda of Liberal politics in Wales for a generation: vote by ballot, the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales, the abolition of tithes (especially during the so-called &#145;tithe war&#146; of 1886&#150;9, in which Gee played a leading part), Welsh home rule, and even, in the 1890s, land nationalization were all key issues backed by the paper.<br>
<br>If, on occasion, <span class="italic">Baner</span> overstepped the mark in its enthusiasm, as in 1868, when Gee was successfully sued for having libelled a Conservative candidate at the general election, the paper helped make Gee &#145;the ruling power of all the great Liberal Party of North Wales&#146;  (reminiscence of Lady Watkin Williams [1913], NL Wales, Gee MSS 8319E). Yet he remained personally unambitious, and asked few favours from either the party or from the individuals whose popularity his newspaper did so much to promote. Though offered several chances to stand as a candidate for parliament himself, notably at Cardiganshire in 1867 and South Caernarvonshire in 1885, he preferred to remain in his native town, where he could keep a close eye on his business interests. His political activism was confined to the affairs of the region. He was a familiar figure on the platform at Liberal political meetings across north Wales, and he also took a leading role in the municipal affairs of Denbigh. And alongside his political activities, he always remained an active member of the Calvinistic Methodists.<br>
<br>Gee died in Fronallt, Denbigh, on 28 June 1898, and was buried in the new graveyard at Denbigh. As a businessman, he played a part in nearly all the important developments in the Denbighshire economy after 1850, having, in addition to his publishing business, interests in mining and slate quarrying, the Ruthin Soda Water Company (of which he was a director), and both the Vale of Clwyd Railway and the North Denbighshire Building Society (of which he was the first president in 1866). Yet his fame and posthumous reputation ultimately rested on his political role. To Welsh politicians of the generation before the First World War Gee was &#145;one of the Pioneers of Welsh liberty&#146;  (O. Williams to T. Gee [1892], NL Wales, Gee MSS 3809D); to his first biographer and former employee, T. Gwynn Jones, writing in 1913, Gee &#145;was the one man who practically made modern Wales what it is politically&#146;  (T. Gwynn Jones to Miss Gee, 12 Sept 1911, NL Wales, Gee MSS 3811D).<br>
