<span class="headword">Petiver,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1665&#150;1718), <span class="occ">botanist and entomologist</span>, was one of at least three sons and a daughter of James Petiver, of Hillmorton, near Rugby, Warwickshire (where James was born), and Mary, daughter of Richard Elborow. His father, a freeman of the Haberdashers' Company in London, died during Petiver's childhood and he and his younger brothers were sent to the grammar school at Rugby at the expense of their mother's wealthy father. Already on the threshold of adolescence, he had the benefit of just one year there before entering an eight-year apprenticeship in 1677 to a prominent London apothecary. This select training he no doubt owed again to his grandfather's benevolence, but he was later to express regret at not having been allowed any further &#145;academical learning&#146;.<br>
<br>After completing his apprenticeship Petiver set up in practice on his own account at White Cross Street, Aldersgate, which was also to be his home for the rest of his life. By then he had already formed a small collection of London plants, doubtless the result of attending the &#145;herbarizings&#146; traditionally laid on by the Society of Apothecaries for apprentices. This seems soon to have developed into a broader passion for natural history, in which entomology enduringly competed with botany as his dominant concern. By as early as 1690 Petiver's reputation was such that he was in frequent correspondence with the country's leading naturalists and a member of a circle of fellow enthusiasts who met informally in and around London. Sir Hans Sloane later drew on this group in his attempt to reinvigorate the Royal Society by recruiting active investigators who were not necessarily highly educated. Petiver and his friend Samuel Doody were invited to one of the society's meetings in June 1693 and allowed to take part in the discussions, an experiment sufficiently well received to gain them election as fellows some two years later. Petiver fully justified Sloane's belief in him by taking an active part in the society's affairs in subsequent years, presenting it with numerous specimens, reading before it several papers, and communicating many letters from his correspondents. Later he was also elected to its council several times.<br>
<br>It seems that this attainment of learned eminence brought occupational advancement in its train, for in 1700, significantly with Sloane again as one of his sponsors, Petiver secured the prestigious appointment of apothecary to the Charterhouse. His ordinary practice also flourished, his meticulously kept prescription books revealing numerous London merchants among his patients. By 1706 he was affluent enough to have lent nearly &pound;800 to a friend. A lifelong bachelor, without a family to support, he also had the good fortune at that point to be left a large sum by a wealthy uncle. The legacy, however, was never paid and the friend, too, went bankrupt, but severe though those reverses were they did not curtail his spending on his collections.<br>
<br>By 1697 Petiver's herbarium alone amounted, on his own reckoning, to between 5000 and 6000 specimens, and he was ready to start reaping some scientific acclaim for the huge investment of time and effort by describing in print some of the contents of the by then famous Museum Petiverianum. The first and most notable of what was to prove a stream of publications to that end appeared in parts in 1695&#150;1703, each part comprising plates and descriptions of either 100 or 200 different animals, plants, shells, or fossils, accompanied by copious notes on contributors of the specimens (as well as cutting remarks on his rival, Leonard Plukenet). This was followed by his <span class="italic">Gazophylacium naturae et artis</span> (1702&#150;9), again in several parts, illustrating with folio plates a further large number of natural history items, in no order and in many cases based on very imperfect material. There were many shorter lists, catalogues, and directions for collecting, all privately printed, most apparently in short runs and many undated, evidently rushed out by Petiver as a means of keeping his correspondents busy on his behalf and assured that what they sent him was duly studied and of value. In 1707 this extraordinary industry even led to the production of a periodical, the <span class="italic">Monthly Miscellany</span>, which survived for several years. Throughout, Petiver was also writing to a great assortment of people in many parts of the world, often at considerable length. The copies he kept of these, now among the Sloane MSS, fill nine volumes and together with his catalogues are a precious source of information on the provenance of specimens and the identity of collectors.<br>
<br>For Petiver, acquisition was virtually all: he had scant inclination to document or arrange his collections with the care that they deserved. A large proportion of his plant specimens have lost such labels as they may have possessed and the labels that survive are often illegible and vague about localities. Many of the specimens, too, are so fragmentary as to be indeterminable. As Sloane was to remark, despairingly, Petiver &#145;put them into heaps &hellip; where they were many of them injured by dust, insects, rain, etc&#146;  (Sloane, vol. 2, introduction). One visiting savant from Germany, Zacharias von Uffenbach, found everything &#145;in prodigious confusion in one wretched cabinet and in boxes&#146;, with no proper attempt at display. To make matters worse, Petiver offered samples of his collections to wealthy connoisseurs at exorbitant prices and advertised for sale sets of named specimens (the first person known to have followed this later widespread practice). Allegedly, too, he abused his appointment (by 1709) as demonstrator to the Society of Apothecaries by exploiting its Chelsea garden remorselessly to enrich his personal herbarium.<br>
<br>Though the first to record many English plants and author of a work, in 1713&#150;15, which usefully remedied the lack of plates in Ray's great <span class="italic">Historia plantarum</span>, it was in English entomology that Petiver made his most significant contribution to learning, a greater one indeed than anyone before except for Ray. His manuscripts are a primary source for the methods of collecting insects at that period and also provide a datum-line for the distribution of many species. By the time he and Ray were in correspondence, to great mutual benefit, in the mid-1690s, he had reared a large number of Lepidoptera, and his <span class="italic">Papilionum Britanniae icones</span> (1717), the first publication devoted exclusively to English butterflies, was to feature more than eighty of these.<br>
<br>Petiver's own travels were not extensive. In England he seems to have ventured no further than the midlands (in 1692, to visit his married sister), Bristol (in 1712), and Cambridge (in 1715, with his kinsman James Sherard). A projected trip to France probably came to nothing, but in 1711 the auction of Paul Hermann's collections took him on Sloane's behalf to the Netherlands, where he met Boerhaave and many other leading Dutch naturalists and had the degree of doctor of medicine conferred on him by the University of Leiden. On 15 October 1716 the younger James Bobart wrote to congratulate Petiver on his marriage, but no supporting evidence has come to light and it is possible that Bobart was misinformed. Early in 1717 serious illness rendered him incapable of any exertion and that August he made his will, bequeathing most of his possessions to his sister. He died at his home in White Cross Street in April 1718 and was buried in St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, on 10 April. On his death Sloane, who had already offered a reputed &pound;4000 for the collections and manuscripts (his books were but few, according to William Sherard), achieved their purchase; the plants alone, filling over 100 volumes, constituted far and away the single largest acquisition of that hardly less acquisitive man. Sloane was also one of six physicians who paid Petiver the final, signal honour of acting as pallbearers at his funeral. Petiver is commemorated in a genus of plants named after him by Plumier.<br>
