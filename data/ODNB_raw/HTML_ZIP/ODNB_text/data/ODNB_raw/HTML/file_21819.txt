<span class="headword">Pemberton,  Charles Reece</span>  (1790&#150;1840), <span class="occ">actor and public lecturer</span>, was born at Pontypool, Monmouthshire, Wales, on 23 January 1790, and registered as Thomas Reece Pemberton. His father was from Warwickshire, his mother was Welsh, and he was the second of three children. When he was about four years old his parents moved to Birmingham, and he was sent to a Unitarian charity school under Daniel Wright. He was then apprenticed to his uncle, a brass-founder in Birmingham, but ran away in 1807 to Liverpool, where he was seized by a press-gang and sent to sea. He served for seven years, and saw some active service off Cadiz, Gibraltar, and Madeira. After the war he became an actor, and led a wandering life; he is said to have managed several theatres in the West Indies with some success. He made an unhappy marriage with a lady named Fanny Pritchard, and they soon separated.<br>
<br>By 1827 Pemberton was in England again, acting, lecturing, and reciting. On 19 February 1828 he played Macbeth at Bath. Genest reported: &#145;he acted tolerably, but nothing farther; he had an indifferent figure, and a bad face, with no expression in it; he had studied the part with great attention, and understood it thoroughly&#146;. On 21 February he appeared as Shylock. During the same year he was acting at Hereford at the assizes; Serjeant (afterwards Sir Thomas) Talfourd was greatly impressed with his performances, and praised him highly in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span> for September 1828, especially his rendering of Shylock and Virginius. Pemberton also played Hotspur, Sir Peter Teazle, and other characters, but was not successful in comic parts. On Talfourd's recommendation he was engaged at Covent Garden by Charles Kemble. He made his first appearance there in March 1829 as Virginius, and later played Shylock. There was much divergence among critics as to his merits, but Talfourd still eulogized him as a tragedian. Pemberton did not, however, reappear at Covent Garden, and, following an engagement at the Royal Theatre, Birmingham, he devoted himself to lecturing and reciting, principally at mechanics' institutes. His favourite subjects were the tragic characters of Shakespeare.<br>
<br>In 1833 Pemberton began writing for the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, then edited by William Johnson Fox, &#145;The Autobiography of Pel. Verjuice&#146;, in which he gave an account of his own experiences. He also wrote some songs and a few plays, notably two tragedies, <span class="italic">The Podesta</span> and <span class="italic">The Banner</span>, and the comedy <span class="italic">Two Catherines</span>, together with some pieces in prose and verse. In 1836 he played Macbeth and Shylock at Birmingham, and at the end of the year he visited the Mediterranean on account of his health. He recommenced lecturing in the summer of 1838 at the Sheffield Mechanics' Institute, but his powers were failing, and a subscription was taken up to enable him to spend the winter in Egypt. This visit brought about no improvement, and he died, not long after his return, on 3 March 1840, at the house of his younger brother, William Dobson Pemberton, on Ludgate Hill, Birmingham. He was buried in the Key Hill cemetery, and the Birmingham Mechanics' Institute, of which G. J. Holyoake was secretary, placed a memorial, with an epitaph by Fox, over his grave. Ebenezer Elliott, the corn-law rhymer, wrote some verses on him entitled &#145;Poor Charles&#146;.<br>
