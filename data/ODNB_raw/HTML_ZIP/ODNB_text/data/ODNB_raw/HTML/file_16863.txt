<span class="headword">Lluelyn,  Martin</span>  (1616&#150;1682), <span class="occ">poet and physician</span>, was born on 12 December 1616 in London, the ninth child (and eighth son) of Martin Lluelyn, whose wife's name is unrecorded. Perhaps the father was the Marten Lewellen, steward of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who in 1609 owed &pound;52 10<i>s</i>. to John Harvey. Harvey's famous brother Dr William Harvey facilitated the repayment of the loan, although the steward continued to struggle with debt  (Keynes, 60&#150;61).<br>
<br>Martin Lluelyn was baptized on 22 December 1616 in St Bartholomew-the-Less, West Smithfield, the church associated with the hospital. Like so many poets of the age, he attended Westminster School. On 25 July 1636 he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford. There he belonged to a circle of &#145;the choicest wits in the University, as Mr. <i>Cartwright</i>, Dr. <i>Lluelin</i>, Mr. <i>Gregory</i>, Mr. <i>Waring</i>, &amp;c.&#146;  (Lloyd, 598&#150;9). The patron of those scholars and poets was Brian Duppa, dean of the college and chaplain to Archbishop Laud; they all retained powerful royalist and high-church sympathies. From 1637 until 1643 Lluelyn contributed verses to several of the Oxford miscellanies commemorating royal occasions and extolling important personages. He graduated BA in 1640 and MA in 1643.<br>
<br>During the civil war Lluelyn joined the royalist army, attaining the rank of captain by 1646, the year his <span class="italic">Men-miracles, with other Poemes</span> was published. Prefacing the collection were seven commendatory poems, including ones by his fellow Oxonians John Fell and John Birkenhead. Four of the poems compliment Lluelyn by comparing him with his friend the poet William Cartwright, who had died in 1643.<br>
<br>The burlesque poem &#145;Men-miracles&#146;, a contemporary recalled, &#145;came forth into the World with great applause&#146;  (W. Winstanley, <span class="italic">Lives of the &hellip; Poets</span>, 1687, 201). Laced with mock pedantry and satire directed at presbyterians and parliamentarians, its 395 hudibrastic couplets present 22 kinds of monsters such as fantastic travellers' tales describe. &#145;Men-miracles&#146; was said to have been &#145;written on purpose to please the Duke [James, Duke of York] into learning&#146;  (Lloyd, 598).<br>
<br>The collection of 1646 also contains fifty-six shorter poems&#151;lyric, satiric, occasional. Lluelyn's five carols &#145;sung to His Majesty&#146; have received particular scrutiny and praise (Wallerstein, 102&#150;10; Loxley, 178&#150;80). Other poems survive, in seventeenth-century manuscripts, with musical settings by John Wilson and others. A song beginning &#145;I felt my heart and found a Chillnesse coole&#146; has appeared, without attribution, in collections of John Wesley's hymns  (Wesley, 2.10). Lluelyn's short poems have been reprinted sporadically in anthologies, beginning with the 1650 edition of <span class="italic">Wit's Recreations</span>.<br>
<br>Also in 1646 a play, <span class="italic">The Witney Wake</span>, was presented at Oxford, the last such cavalier entertainment before the city's surrender to parliamentary troops in June. A description of the play with texts of the songs, published that year, gives the author as &#145;Mr. Loyd, Student of Christ Church in Oxford, and a Captaine of that Garison&#146;; Lluelyn's authorship was established only in 1968  (Cutts, &#145;<i>Wickham wakened</i>&#146;, 448&#150;56). Perhaps it was the same play that the war-depleted university hoped to present before the new king in July 1661, &#145;made by Dr. Llewellyn, but they are so in want of actors, that they fear being obliged to make use of the Red Bull players, now at Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 32).<br>
<br>Ejected from the university by the parliamentary visitors in 1648, Lluelyn practised medicine in London, applying &#145;his genius as much to physic, as before he had to poetry&#146;, his acquaintance Anthony Wood remarked  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.42). The political situation notwithstanding, Lluelyn was granted the DM degree from Oxford on 15 July 1653. On 24 September he was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians; he was made a fellow on 27 May 1659. By the 1650s he had married, though his wife's name is unknown. They had a son Martin (1652&#150;1729), who became an army officer, and a daughter Lettice.<br>
<br>During the interregnum Lluelyn continued to write poetry, including commendatory poems for the posthumous Latin works of his old Oxford friend John Gregory (1650), for the posthumous plays and poems of Cartwright (1651), for William Harvey's <span class="italic">Anatomical Exercitations</span> (1653), and for Richard Whitlock's <span class="italic">Zo&ouml;tomia</span> (1654). At the Restoration, an event on which he published a 130-line panegyric, Lluelyn was appointed physician to the king, as well as principal of St Mary's Hall and a visitor of the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>Lluelyn married Martha, daughter of George Long of Penn, Buckinghamshire, on 5 August 1662. In 1664 the family moved from Oxford to Buckinghamshire&#151;first, apparently, to Amersham, where a son, George (1668&#150;1739), was born; he became a musician and clergyman. Then the family lived in High Wycombe, where a son, Richard, was born (about 1672), later referred to as &#145;Dr Richard Lluellyn&#146;  (Greaves, 276). Other children of that marriage were named Maurice, Martha, and Mary. In Wycombe, Lluelyn continued to practise medicine. On 9 September 1671 he was sworn burgess and alderman, and on 28 September he was elected mayor, a position that he occupied for only a year. According to Wood he &#145;behaved himself severe against the fanatics&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.43). Lluelyn published a satire, <span class="italic">Wickham Wakened</span> (1672), &#145;in Rime Dogrell&#146;, in response to his controversy with a Quaker faction. He was chosen to deliver an address to the king on behalf of Wycombe on 24 August 1681.<br>
<br>A memoir of his Wycombe friend Isaac Milles, probably written by Milles's son John, characterized Lluelyn as &#145;an eminent and very learned Physitian &hellip; universally esteem'd by all that knew him &hellip; A Man of singular Integrity of Life and Manners, and of the most comely and decent Gravity and Deportment&#146;  (Milles, 43&#150;4). Lluelyn died in Wycombe on 17 March 1682 and was buried there in the north aisle of the church; his long epitaph in Latin was written by Isaac Milles.<br>
