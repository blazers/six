<span class="headword">Bourn,  Samuel</span>  (1714&#150;1796), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Crook, near Kendal, the second son of the Presbyterian minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3000/', "Samuel Bourn (1689&#150;1754)")</script> and his wife, Hannah Harrison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1768), of Kendal. He was educated at Stand grammar school, Lancashire, and Glasgow University, where he studied under Francis Hutcheson and John Simson. His ministry began in 1742 at Rivington, Lancashire, though he was not ordained until some years after his settlement. In his ordination declaration he specified the duties of the ministry, and elevated the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> as the sole authority in matters of doctrine and ethics. While he enjoyed the friendship of Hugh Willoughby, fifteenth Lord Willoughby of Parham, who lived at Shaw Place, Rivington, and was a representative of the last of the Presbyterian noble families, Bourn felt constricted, and was impatient for advancement.<br>
<br>On 12 May 1752 Bourn delivered a sermon on <span class="roman">Mark</span> 4: 30 before the Lancashire provincial assembly of ministers at Manchester. In the same year the sermon was published under the title <span class="italic">The Rise, Progress, Corruption and Declension of the Christian Religion</span>. This led to his being invited to Norwich, where in 1754 he succeeded Peter Finch as the colleague of John Taylor. Bourn was thus present when the Norwich Presbyterians left the building in Little St Mary's (owned by the trustees of the Walloon or French protestants), in which they had been worshipping, for their new Octagon Chapel, which was opened on 12 May 1756. In the following year Taylor left Norwich for the dissenting academy at Warrington, and John Hoyle and Robert Alderson (father of Sir E. H. Alderson) came in succession as Bourn's colleagues. Among those raised under his ministry was Sir James Edward Smith, founder of the Linnean Society.<br>
<br>After losing &pound;1000 speculating on his brother Daniel's cotton mill business, Bourn travelled from place to place in 1758 seeking subscriptions to finance the publication of two volumes of his sermons. He entrusted his manuscript to the rationalist and controversialist Samuel Chandler of the Old Jewry, and in 1759 heard Chandler preach a denunciation of the doctrine of the annihilation of the wicked as utterly inconsistent with Christian teaching. Since Bourn had espoused that doctrine in one of his sermons he took this as a personal attack, and published a letter against Chandler in 1759. John Mason (1706&#150;1763) entered the controversy with his <span class="italic">Christian Morals</span> (1761), and Bourn appended a rejoinder to his <span class="italic">Discourses on the Parables of our Saviour</span> (1764).<br>
<br>Bourn was highly respected by those clergy of the Church of England who knew him, and when, about 1775, he became too ill to work and retired on &pound;60 p.a. to Thorpe, Norwich, Dr Mann, bishop of Cork, offered him a sinecure living of &pound;300 p.a. if only he would conform to the established church. Bourn declined&#151;a display of nonconformist integrity which earned the admiration and the practical support of Samuel Parr, later headmaster of Norwich grammar school.<br>
<br>Like his father, Bourn was an Arian in the line of Samuel Clarke. At a time when the preaching of morality was widespread, he was unusually pessimistic in expecting no great improvement in the moral state of humanity. His sermons are forceful, carefully argued, and sometimes solemn. He also published <span class="italic">A series of discourses on the principles and evidences of natural religion and the Christian revelation</span> (1760), and his last publication comprised <span class="italic">Fifty Sermons on Various Subjects, Critical, Philosophical and Moral</span> (1777). His projected &#145;History of the Hebrews&#146; was left unfinished at his death. Bourn married late in life; he and his wife left no children. He died at Norwich on 24 September 1796, and was buried three days later in the graveyard of Octagon Chapel.<br>
