<span class="headword">Bentley,  John James</span>  (1860&#150;1918), <span class="occ">journalist and football administrator</span>, was born at Chapel Town, Turton, Lancashire, on 14 June 1860, the third of four sons of John Bentley, a grocer, and his wife, Ann Beavan. Turton was only a small village but what may have been the first football club in Lancashire was formed there in 1872 when John Charles Kay, son of the local squire, returned from Harrow School and put together a team which played on a pitch behind the row of terraced houses where Bentley lived. By the time he was fourteen John was playing alongside his elder brothers, Tom and William; at twenty he was the club's captain, and shortly afterwards he became secretary and treasurer. His strength as a wing-half also won him selection for Bolton Association and for Lancashire. He stopped playing at the relatively early age of twenty-five but was involved with the sport at the highest level for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>The early part of Bentley's professional career was as a clerk for the London and North Western Railway Company in Bolton and then as a clerk to the Bolton school board. In 1882 he set up in business on his own in the emerging profession of accountancy and on 21 September that year married Betsy (1862/3&#150;1917), daughter of Richard Entwistle, a builder from Blackpool. Their relationship was not broken until her death thirty-five years later. They had three daughters and a son, Harry, who died at the age of two in December 1892. Bentley had begun sending in reports of Turton's matches to local newspapers while still playing, adopting as his <i>nom de plume</i> Free Critic. In 1884 he began writing regularly for the <span class="italic">Bolton Cricket and Football Field</span>, and two years later he became assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Athletic News</span>. Sports writing was a growing branch of journalism and Bentley learned the job as he went along. He helped to transform the <span class="italic">Athletic News</span> from a twopenny weekly with a circulation of about 10,000 in 1886 to a penny paper with a circulation of nearly 200,000 by 1900 and a readership of many more. He was editor from 1895 to 1900.<br>
<br>In 1885 Bentley became secretary of Bolton Wanderers and in 1888 he was one of those to whom William McGregor wrote proposing what became the Football League. He served on the league's management committee for the next thirty years. By the middle of the 1890s he was combining the roles of referee, journalist, editor, Football Association (FA) councillor, and president of the Football League. In 1905 he became the first league official to become a vice-president of the FA. By this time he held a wide variety of other positions within the game and must have been one of the most powerful figures in English football. It caused no surprise when he became chairman of Manchester United in 1908 after the restructuring of the club following financial mismanagement; he later filled the position of club secretary between 1912 and 1916.<br>
<br>Bentley was a staunch defender of the professional player, although he supported the setting of a maximum permissible wage. He believed that professional football had to be run on business principles but thought that there should be no direct profit to individuals. His short hair and clipped moustache gave him an autocratic air, and although he was no orator (his many journalistic words were eminently unquotable) he was an influential leader of the sport during its most formative phase. He died at Fairhaven, near Blackpool, on 2 September 1918 and was buried in Turton cemetery, next to his wife and son.<br>
