<span class="headword">Strachan,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1592&#150;1634), <span class="occ">traveller and orientalist</span>, was born the younger son of a noble family in the Mearns (he later used the toponymic <i>Merniensis</i>), perhaps of Thornton, Kincardineshire; nothing else is known of his early life. He was a student in Paris by 1592, at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson in Lorraine in 1593, and next at the University of B&eacute;arn, in Navarre. The autograph book (<span class="italic">Album amicorum</span>) he began there discloses his travels between 1599 and 1609, first via several universities, Catholic and protestant, to Carpentras (1600&#150;01) and then briefly to the new Scots College in Rome. Scots Catholics in exile are prominent among the album's contributors.<br>
<br>Strachan returned to Scotland in 1602, recalled by his family, who had turned protestant and hoped to win him too. But he was fulfilling a mission as a courier between the Jesuit leadership in Rome and Scotland. Although accused as a traitor before James VI he remained steadfast and made his escape. He reached Rome by early 1604, having perhaps reported <i>en route</i>, in Paris and elsewhere, on Catholic fortunes in Scotland. He soon departed, via the Schottenkloster at Regensburg, to Paris, where he taught classics at the Coll&egrave;ge du Mans from 1604 for some years. The translations of Greek writers attributed to him by Thomas Dempster were perhaps produced for his teaching. Apart from epigrams, tributes, and a noble elegy for Patrick Seton, Strachan published only a congratulation on the election of Pope Paul V (1605) and a translation of Lucian of Samosata on calumny (1607). During these Paris years he also served the duke of Guise, did private tutoring, and continued to advocate the Catholic mission to Scotland. In letters of 1609 and 1610 to Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, protector of the Scots at Rome (later Urban VIII), Strachan unsuccessfully sought appointment as a papal agent in Paris on behalf of Scottish Catholicism.<br>
<br>Strachan left Paris, probably in 1613, for Constantinople, from where, by 1615, he had moved on through Syria, Lebanon, and the Holy Land to Aleppo. Wanderlust combined with the lure of oriental languages, perhaps intended for the service of Eastern missions. His travels over a decade are documented chiefly by the <span class="italic">Viaggi</span> of the like-minded Italian Pietro della Valle, who first met him in Esfahan in 1619. Strachan mastered Persian and Arabic, in which he was as fluent as any Western scholar of his age, and perhaps also Turkish and Hebrew. He collected valuable manuscripts, some forty of which survive, mostly in the Vatican and Naples libraries. His mobility limited the accomplishments that his learning promised, but his genial humanity was recognized on all sides.<br>
<br>From Aleppo, Strachan got employment between 1616 and 1618 as physician to Emir Feyyad, ruler of the Arabs between Syria and the Euphrates. Favours from Feyyad included marriage to his widowed sister-in-law, which supports evidence that Strachan became known as a Muslim. The conversion, if such it was, can have been only temporary: the threat of enforced circumcision provoked flight to Baghdad, which presumably also involved repudiation of the marriage. After setting out across Persia towards India he was persuaded in Esfahan to enter service, in 1619, with the East India Company. His language skills and contacts with Aleppo and Baghdad made him invaluable. After two years personal animosities forced him out in 1621. He then lived with the Carmelites in Esfahan and taught Arabic. His will of 26 September 1621, witnessed by Pietro della Valle, bequeathed his books to the Discalced Carmelites of Rome. His own return to Europe as he intended lacks evidence: he seems instead to have rejoined the East India Company for a year. His Persian manuscripts place him in Esfahan in 1624 and still in the East in 1634, although in 1630 della Valle reported his death some time earlier while returning from India to Persia. A case has been made that Strachan was active as late as 1655, but the date of his death is unknown.<br>
