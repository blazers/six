<span class="headword">Oldfield,  Josiah</span>  (1863&#150;1953), <span class="occ">lawyer, physician, and writer on health</span>, was born at Ryton, Shropshire, on 28 February 1863, the son of a provision dealer, David Oldfield, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bates. He attended Newport grammar school, and then went to Oxford to read theology, matriculating with a non-collegiate affiliation on 15 April 1882. He graduated BA in 1885. He then trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn (BCL 1888) and practised on the Oxford circuit. He was married with at least one daughter, Josie.<br>
<br>Some time during his stay at Oxford, Oldfield became a vegetarian and turned towards medicine, which became a second career. He took his medical diploma at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and subsequently founded the Humanitarian Hospital of St Francis, of which he was for some years chairman and senior physician. He was also warden and senior physician to the Lady Margaret Fruitarian Hospital at Sittingbourne. The Fruitarians were members of an Order of the Golden Age, with headquarters at Barcombe Hall, Paignton, in Devon. They were dietary reformers who abstained from all foods obtained by the cruel infliction of pain, and who lived mainly on gathered, preferably uncooked, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. Oldfield became a prolific popular health author for the vegetarian and humanitarian cause, publishing on average a book every two years between 1892 and 1953. His first two books, <span class="italic">The Cost of Living</span> (1892) and <span class="italic">The Ideal Diet in Relation to Real Life</span> (1892), were both published by the Vegetarian Society, as were <span class="italic">The Influenza</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Tuberculosis, or, Flesh-Eating a Cause of Consumption</span> (1897, 2nd edn), and other dietary tracts on indigestion, rheumatism, and appendicitis. The Ideal Publishing Union issued Oldfield's <span class="italic">The Evils of Butchery</span> (1895), <span class="italic">A Groaning Creation</span> (1895), <span class="italic">The Voice of Nature, or, What Man should Eat</span> (1898), and also <span class="italic">The Claims of Common Life, or, The Scientific Relations of Humans and non-Humans</span> (1898), a book which discussed the ethics of killing animals, and the social responsibility of science&#151;&#145;science increases the rights of animals by deepening the rights of man&#146;  (p. 71).<br>
<br>Oldfield addressed the rights of man when he founded the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment in 1901, with an accompanying book; he also took a study tour of India that year, looking at political grievances. He remained active in legal reform circles, publishing <span class="italic">Hanging for Murder</span> (1908), and becoming chairman of the Romilly Society in 1910. He was admitted to the Jamaican bar in 1920, and became a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1920. During the First World War Oldfield raised and commanded a casualty clearing station and was mentioned in dispatches; he was invalided out with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Between 1905 and 1935 he published a steady stream of successful commercial books on natural diet cookery and aspects of what was then becoming known as naturopathy&#151;such as <span class="italic">The Best Sixpenny Cookery</span> (1916), <span class="italic">The Raisin Cure</span> (1923), <span class="italic">The Dry Diet Cure</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Fasting for Health and Life</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Deep Breathing and Breathing Exercises</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Eat and be Happy</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">The Beauty Aspect of Health and Living</span> (1935). He was still writing prolifically in his eighties, with his series comprising <span class="italic">Mystery of Marriage</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Mystery of Birth</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">Mystery of Death</span> (1951), and a Fruitarian longevity tract, <span class="italic">The Crown of Grapes: Eat Right and Live Long</span> (1952). By this time he was living in Fruitarian retreat at Margaret Manor, Doddington, near Faversham, Kent, listing his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as tree planting and Fruitarian lecturing. The Fruitarians published his final volumes of letters and a valedictory <span class="italic">Popular Guide to Fruitarian Diet and Cookery</span> in 1952. Oldfield died at Doddington on 2 February 1953.<br>
