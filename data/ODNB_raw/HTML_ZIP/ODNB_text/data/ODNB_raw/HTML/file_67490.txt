<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Liddell,  Guy Maynard</span>  (1892&#150;1958), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 8 November 1892 at 64 Victoria Street, London, one of three sons of Augustus Frederick Liddell, a retired captain in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Emily Shinner (<i>d</i>. 1901). At the time of his birth, Liddell's father worked in the royal household and was comptroller and treasurer to Prince and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. He studied in Germany, but then served in the Royal Field Artillery during the First World War and was awarded an MC. Having abandoned a promising career as a cellist, Liddell joined Scotland Yard's special branch in 1919 as a subordinate to Sir Basil Thompson in the directorate of intelligence. He was responsible for co-ordinating the police raid on the Arcos building in Moorgate in May 1927 (which also housed the Soviet trade delegation), in pursuit of a missing classified RAF document. Although the document was not recovered, more than enough evidence was found of Soviet espionage, which was enhanced by the unexpected defection of a terrified code clerk, Anton Miller, who had been detained while attempting to burn incriminating files.<br>
<br>In October 1931, following an amalgamation in Whitehall, Liddell moved with his small team of civilian analysts to the Security Service, MI5, and was appointed deputy director of counter-espionage under Brigadier Jasper Harker. His first great success came late in 1936 when he went to Washington, DC, to inform the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that a Dundee hairdresser, Mrs Jessie Jordan, was acting as a post-box for German intelligence and relaying letters to and from an address in New York. An immediate FBI investigation identified an immigrant, Gunther Rumrich, as a German spy, and allowed J. Edgar Hoover to take the credit for arresting an extensive transatlantic espionage network.<br>
<br>Following the success of this first example of co-operation with the FBI, Liddell supervised a brilliant coup in which a long-term MI5 agent, Olga Gray, penetrated the Communist Party of Great Britain and gained the confidence of its national organizer, Percy Glading. She accumulated proof that Glading had been recruiting sources inside the Woolwich arsenal, and when the spy ring was arrested in January 1938, three of its members pleaded guilty to stealing secret blueprints and were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The case demonstrated the value of cultivating deep-cover agents, and highlighted the threat of Soviet espionage, although it failed to link the spies with any Soviet officials.<br>
<br>Liddell was promoted to director of B division in June 1940 and played a key role in the appointment of his subordinates, including Dick White and Anthony Blunt, who were both to become close friends. His reliance on personal contacts led him to choose some impressive intellectual talent, and B division effectively took control of the enemy's entire espionage organization in Britain. This extraordinary achievement, documented by Sir John Masterman in <span class="italic">The Double Cross System</span> (1972), resulted in numerous future High Court judges and university dons running a large stable of double agents, thereby providing the deception planners with a reliable conduit into the German high command. Thus Liddell was closely associated with two of MI5's most spectacular accomplishments, the interception and decryption of German intelligence signals by the Radio Security Service, and the famous &#145;double cross system&#146;. The Radio Security Service had grown, under Liddell's supervision, from an inter-service liaison committee known as the Wireless Board into a sophisticated cryptographic organization that operated in tandem with Bletchley Park, concentrating on <i>Abwehr</i> communications, and enabling MI5 case officers to monitor the progress made by their double agents through the reports submitted by their enemy controllers to Berlin.<br>
<br>Liddell had many Irish connections, having married Lord Revelstoke's daughter, the Hon. Calypso Baring, in 1926, and he selected his brother Cecil to head MI5's highly successful Irish section. His marriage, however, was to cause him great unhappiness and it was dissolved in 1943 after Calypso had deserted him for her American half-brother, leaving Liddell to fight a long battle for custody of their son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In December 2002 Liddell's wartime diaries, typewritten in twelve volumes, were released at the Public Record Office. They provide &#145;an unrivalled account of the internal workings of MI5 from August 1939 to June 1945&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>). The day-to-day workings of the Security Service are richly documented, including the unmasking of traitors such as John King, a Foreign Office clerk, who passed information to the Soviet Union. The diaries also record more lurid planning: a year before the war in Europe ended, Liddell was discussing a scheme to threaten Germany &#145;with the uranium bomb&#146;  (ibid.) if it fired V2 rockets.<br>
<br>After the war Liddell was appointed deputy director-general under the new Labour administration's choice of Sir Percy Sillitoe, and he remained in that post until 1953 when, embarrassed by the defection of his friend Guy Burgess, he took early retirement to become security adviser to the Atomic Energy Authority. After a remarkable career in counter-espionage, it was ironic that several of his closest friends were to be exposed as spies, among them the Welsh academic Goronwy Rees, for whose son he was godfather. Before Rees died in 1979 he denounced Liddell as a spy, and the disclosure that Liddell had failed to act against Anthony Blunt when Rees had first named him in 1951 created a furore that, together with his unwise friendships and his preference for homosexual company, posthumously wrecked his reputation as a shrewd intelligence professional. His principal legacy to the Security Service is a collection of diaries recording his daily activities during his career. Highly classified, and codenamed Wallflowers, the document remains the most comprehensive historical account of MI5's clandestine operations.<br>
<br>Guy Liddell was appointed CBE in 1944 in recognition of his contribution to allied counter-intelligence and made a CB in 1953. He died on 2 December 1958 at his home, 18 Richmond Court, Sloane Street, London.<br>
