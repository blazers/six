<span class="headword">Shewen,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1631&#150;1695), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was of unknown parentage, and nothing is known of him before 1654. By this date Shewen had joined the Southwark Quaker Meeting, which was then gathering in private homes, including Shewen's house at the sign of Two Brewers in Bermondsey Street, Bermondsey. Describing himself in his will as a gentleman, Shewen appears to have been involved in business of some description, for an acquaintance of the Welsh Quaker Richard Davies was apprenticed to him. In 1679 he married Ann Raper (<i>d</i>. 1706), with whom he had three children.<br>
<br>Shewen was appointed an elder of the meeting in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, Southwark, and from the 1650s onwards was active in the Quaker movement as both preacher and controversialist. In 1659 he was among a number of Quaker preachers subjected to &#145;manifold Abuses&#146; by hecklers at meetings in Mitcham, Surrey  (Besse, 1.680). In April 1674 he engaged in a public dispute with the Baptist leader Jeremiah Ives in Croydon, Surrey. This doctrinal quarrel continued as a pamphlet controversy throughout that year and launched Shewen's career as a printed author. Over the next two decades Shewen published a number of doctrinal and devotional works. His works pleaded constantly for liberty of conscience and for toleration at the most parochial level, his writing arising from ongoing experience of persecution. In 1683 he was among a number of Quakers who, barred from their meeting-house in Horselydown, were arrested for meeting instead in the street. In March 1686 a royal warrant calling for the halt of legal proceedings against Shewen and his wife, among others, identified the former as a &#145;recusant&#146; of St Mary Magdalen, Southwark  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1686&#150;7</i>, 72).<br>
<br>Later that year Shewen and his wife moved to Enfield, Middlesex. It is presumably here that he died on 28 May 1695, aged about sixty-four; he was buried at Bunhill Fields. By the time of his death he was of substantial means, leaving a well-appointed property in Enfield and over &pound;2000 in disposable money. The instructions detailed in his will indicate, moreover, that Shewen had considerable financial acumen.<br>
<br>Despite his regular subjection, as an early Quaker, to prejudice and harassment, Shewen's ministry nevertheless seems to have been combined with a successful business career. Author of &#145;several seasonable experimental treatises&#146;  (Whiting, 508), Shewen is most aptly characterized in his own words: applauding William III's declaration for liberty of conscience, the title-page to his last work, <span class="italic">A Brief Testimony for Religion</span> (1688), announces that it is written by &#145;a Hater of no man because of his opinion&#146;.<br>
