<span class="headword">Veley,  Margaret</span>  (1843&#150;1887), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 12 May 1843 at Braintree, Essex, the second daughter of Augustus Charles Veley, a solicitor of Swiss extraction, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of Thomas Ludbey, rector of Cranham. Her father's practice was mainly occupied with the ecclesiastical business of the district. Veley was educated at home, with the exception of one term spent at Queen's College, Tufnell Park, London. She was proficient in French and well read in French literature. In contrast to the conservatism of her family, she developed quite liberal political and religious views, leaving a post as a Sunday school teacher when a new clergyman, to whose views she was opposed, was hired.<br>
<br>Veley began writing both prose and verse early, though she published nothing until 1870. Her first poem, &#145;Michaelmas Daisies&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in April of that year, and in September she published a short story, &#145;Milly's First Love&#146;, in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. In 1872 she began her first and best-known novel, <span class="italic">For Percival</span>, a story of &#145;womanly self-sacrifice&#146;  (Blain, Clements &amp; Grundy, <span class="italic">Feminist comp.</span>, 1111) which appeared as a serial in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> (September&#150;December 1878), then under the editorship of Leslie Stephen. It was immediately published in book form and was well received. Written in a clear and pointed style, it shows a strong sense of humour and keen perception of character.<br>
<br>The deaths of two of Veley's married sisters in 1877 and 1885 and of her father in 1879 strongly affected her later writings. In 1880 she moved to London. The stories &#145;Mrs. Austin&#146; and &#145;Damocles&#146; appeared serially in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> in 1880 and 1882 respectively. <span class="italic">Mitchelhurst Place</span> appeared serially in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> in 1884. A two-volume edition was printed that year, and an edition in one volume in 1885. <span class="italic">A Garden of Memories</span> ran through the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> from July to September 1886 and was published in two volumes in 1887.<br>
<br>Veley died, unmarried, at her home at 45 Matheson Road, West Kensington, London, on 7 December 1887 after a short illness. She was buried on 10 December in Braintree cemetery. A posthumous volume of her poems, <span class="italic">A Marriage of Shadows and other Poems</span>, published in 1888, contained a biographical preface by Leslie Stephen.<br>
