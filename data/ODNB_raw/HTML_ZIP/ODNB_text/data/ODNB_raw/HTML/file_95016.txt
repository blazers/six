<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ryder,  (John) Gordon</span>  (1919&#150;2000), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 5 December 1919 at 37 Lanehouse Road, Thornaby-on-Tees, Yorkshire, near Middlesbrough, the eldest of the two children of John (Jack) Ryder, brass moulder and foundry manager, and his wife, Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sheard. He studied at the local grammar school and in 1936 entered articles to a Middlesbrough firm of architects, William Edwin Haslock. In 1930 Ryder had suffered a serious accident while rock climbing; subsequently excluded from war service, he enrolled in 1940 at King's College school of architecture, Newcastle upon Tyne, then part of Durham University, as an RIBA probationer. After qualifying in 1944, he undertook study at Newcastle in town planning under Thomas Wilfred Sharp, and in the following year was appointed a studio demonstrator at the school of architecture. Ryder left his teaching post in 1948 to join Berthold Lubetkin, chief architect for the new town of Peterlee in co. Durham.<br>
<br>It was here that Ryder met <a name="cosubject_101266"></a><span class="headword">Peter Yates</span>  (1920&#150;1982), <span class="occ">architect and artist</span>, who was born on 19 July 1920 at 118 Wallwood Road, Leytonstone, Essex, the son of Frank Yates, builders' merchants manager, and his wife, Frances Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. Yates attended Wanstead School until 1936 and then worked as a commercial artist in London before studying architecture at Regent Street Polytechnic (1938&#150;41). On 19 July 1941 he enlisted in the RAF and&#151;after postings in Wales and Ireland&#151;in 1944 served with Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces at Versailles. In February 1945 Yates met Le Corbusier and began an association that lasted until the French architect's death; others whom he met in this period included Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas. Discharged from the RAF in December 1945, Yates worked in the offices of Ove Arup before joining Lubetkin&#151;and his future business partner, Gordon Ryder&#151;at Peterlee.<br>
<br>The three years Ryder and Yates spent with Lubetkin proved to be their most formative period. Though nothing was built at Peterlee before Lubetkin's resignation in 1950, the experience reinforced the young architects' commitment to modernist values. In the Peterlee office they worked together on master planning and on social housing projects, particularly that at Thorntree Gill, for which the intended design of linked cubic blocks forming terraces would appear in their own housing development at North Kenton, Newcastle (1963). The legacy of Peterlee may also be seen in their competition entry for Carlisle civic centre (1956) and from 1965 in their various projects for Northern Gas at Killingworth, near Newcastle. After Lubetkin's resignation Yates returned to Paris as chief designer for a commercial art firm, Unit&eacute; d'Informations Visuelles, while Ryder opened an office in Newcastle.<br>
<br>The buildings from Ryder's first years in practice were sporadic, unpredictable, and limited&#151;until late 1954&#151;by the licensing of all building materials. Consequently more time was spent on competition work, including that held by the City of London for the new Golden Lane estate (1952, won by Geoffrey Powell), which saw Ryder again draw on his experience of Peterlee. Ryder's first executed project was a new clubhouse for the Tynemouth Sailing Club (1952&#150;3), of which he was an enthusiastic member. Here he met two of his most important early clients, James Liddell and Derek Damerell, who shared his love of sailing. Liddell, as commodore of the sailing club, had financed the building of several Firefly sailing dinghies for an Olympic trials team of which Ryder had been a member. In 1953 Ryder began work at Olympia, London, on an exhibition stand for the Carlisle Plaster Company (of which Damerell was managing director), and during a visit to the capital he had a chance encounter with Peter Yates at an underground station. Having recently suffered a period of ill health, and with no post to return to in Paris, Yates now agreed to join Ryder as an equal partner in his Newcastle practice.<br>
<br>From the outset the office of Ryder and Yates displayed a strong commitment to modernism, which resulted in a number of rejections by shocked planning committees. Some commissions for private houses did arise, but it was a second premium in the Carlisle civic centre competition that helped to raise the practice's profile and give it greater respectability. They came to national attention with a house on Grand Parade, Tynemouth, for James Liddell and his family (Liddell House, 1958), which was featured in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and caught the eye of the northern district manager of Martin's Bank, who identified them as the architects to revitalize the bank's image. The refurbishment of branches in Newcastle and Hexham in 1962, while showing a respect for the classically inspired fa&ccedil;ades, remodelled the interiors in a highly modernist manner.<br>
<br>Liddell House was one of fourteen private houses designed by Ryder and Yates across the north of England, of which twelve were built between 1952 and 1980. The designs demonstrated recurring themes in plan, form, and use of materials that came to characterize much of Ryder and Yates's domestic, commercial, and industry-related work. While specific to client and site, and lacking an obvious generic approach, the partnership's house designs were shaped by the importance attached to their ground plans, with an emphasis on major living spaces to which secondary areas were linked. In their division of open spaces by staircases and columns (used structurally to allow uninterrupted glass fa&ccedil;ades), and in their use of dramatic sculptural effects, Ryder and Yates also drew on Le Corbusier and Lubetkin respectively. Among the twelve completed houses was Trees (1967), at Woolsington, the first of two homes designed by Ryder for his own family. On 5 April 1958 at Tynemouth register office, he had married Mary Irene McLean, a 21-year-old schoolteacher, and daughter of Neil McLean, medical practitioner; they had two sons and two daughters. On 4 October of the same year, at St Andrew's, Greensted, Essex, Peter Yates married Helen Maude Southgate (1933&#150;1973), with whom he lived at Hamsterley Mill, Rowlands Gill, Northumberland, with their three sons and two daughters. After the death of his first wife Yates married, on 30 October 1976, at Brighton register office, Gillian (Gilly) Jessica Eden (<i>b</i>. 1931), daughter of Lincoln Eden, civil engineer.<br>
<br>Ryder and Yates's first major commercial project (1962&#150;4) was for a Newcastle car dealer, for whom they designed a showroom whose entire frontage was carried on three columns, allowing an uninterrupted glass wall. This was a remarkable use of space, structure, materials, and colour arrangements, which demonstrated the architects' characteristic control, the result being a beautiful yet simple building. Ryder and Yates was also notable in this period as one of the country's first multi-disciplinary practices in which architects worked alongside structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers. The success of this approach was further demonstrated in their design for the Northern Gas Board headquarters, Norgas House (1963&#150;5), the first major building in Killingworth New Town, on the outskirts of Newcastle, and the partnership's first large project. The client's requirements for maximum flexibility led to a design that simplified the main accommodation and internal arrangements, allowing them to change layouts according to business requirements. The use of colour, water, reflections in glass, and Minoan imagery was performed with great assurance and deceptive simplicity. Norgas House was followed with a second commission at Killingworth, to build an engineering research station for British Gas (1965&#150;8). The final design comprised two distinct internal sections: a fixed element, which included an entrance, library, and administration area over an underground car park, and a flexible section for offices, laboratories, and workshops. The structure was encased in a regular box of painted concrete panels and ribbon windows, lending a formality to the exterior that was in contrast to the variable uses of the interior. The building's fixed element, with its symbolic entrance bridge and decorative pylon, proclaimed itself with six striking roof-top concrete trumpets. Together the Killingworth commissions represent the high point of Ryder and Yates's work, gaining them national recognition, two RIBA awards (1966 and 1969), and for the research station the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> award for industrial architecture (1969). Owing much to Le Corbusier, the engineering research station is arguably Ryder and Yates's best-known building; described as &#145;pure architecture&#146; by the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>, it received grade 2 star listed status in 1997. Further Killingworth projects included high-rise offices (1967, dem.), a training centre for Northern Gas (1970), and a school of engineering for the British Gas Council in 1974. Later industrial commissions were for factories for Vickers Armaments in Newcastle (1981) and Leeds (1982).<br>
<br>Alongside a move into commercial and industrial designs, the partnership maintained their interest in social housing. A small-scale project at Fenham (1963), followed by the North Kenton estate (1962&#150;6) for Newcastle city council, provided Ryder and Yates with an opportunity to develop their ideas on multi-occupancy living, first explored with Lubetkin at Peterlee. With the Fenham pilot deemed a success, 600 dwellings, with 8 different house types, were planned for Kenton. All of the initial themes&#151;such as segregation of vehicles and pedestrians, and house types with terraced, courtyard, and linked pavilions, all with flat roofs, strip windows, and white render&#151;were repeated at North Kenton. Like Le Corbusier and Lubetkin before them, Ryder and Yates also produced a series of buildings for health care and welfare. Two Newcastle clinics (both 1960) established the practice's reputation for buildings of social purpose and were followed by commissions for the Salvation Army, including Hopedene maternity home (1969) and two social services centres in Newcastle (1974) and Sunderland (1982). MEA House (1974) was Ryder and Yates's first substantial building in Newcastle city centre. One of the first buildings designed specifically to house a range of voluntary organizations, it remains one of Newcastle's finest modern designs and one of the city centre's best pieces of townscape.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Peter Yates continued to work as a painter and many of his pieces appeared as murals integrated into the partnership's domestic and commercial designs. He exhibited in mixed shows from 1942, and solo displays of his work were held in the north-east from 1975 and in London in 1982; this was followed by a retrospective exhibition later that year at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle, and by a posthumous exhibition at the RIBA gallery, London, in 1985. Peter Yates died from cancer on 16 November 1982 at his home, 20 Brandling Park, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne; he was survived by his second wife, Gillian, and by four of his children, one son having predeceased him. After Yates's death Ryder remained at what became the Ryder Nicklin Partnership on the appointment as partner of Ted Nicklin (<i>d</i>. 1994) until his retirement in 1989. From 1980 he lived at Triangles, Riding Mill, near Newcastle, the second home he designed for his family. It was here that Ryder, who was appointed OBE for services to architecture, died from pneumonia on 1 December 2000; he was cremated in Gateshead and survived by his wife and his four children.<br>
