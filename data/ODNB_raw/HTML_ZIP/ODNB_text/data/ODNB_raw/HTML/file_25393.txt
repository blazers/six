<span class="headword">Sherwin,  Ralph</span> <span class="st"> [St Ralph Sherwin]</span>  (1549/50&#150;1581), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was born at Rodsley, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire. His parents were probably John and Constance Sherwin. In 1568 he became a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and &#145;progressed with great industry the several classes of logic and philosophy&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 478). He took his BA on 22 November 1571, and, on 2 July 1574, &#145;being then accounted an acute philosopher and excellent graecian and hebrician&#146;, he took his MA as senior of the act, impressing an audience that included the earl of Leicester, the queen's favourite.<br>
<br>In 1575 Sherwin left Oxford University and embraced Catholicism. &#145;Having received leave from Sir John Petre to study medicine abroad&#146;  (Boase, 76) he went to Douai and after two years was ordained priest by the bishop of Cambrai on 23 March 1577. In August he proceeded to Rome. In the disputes that took place concerning the direction of the English College, Sherwin played a leading part and became the spokesman for those who saw the future of the college to be a place for the preparation of missioners to England rather than a refuge for exiles. The college annals (<span class="italic">Liber ruber</span>) begin on 23 April 1579 when the college oath was initially administered. Sherwin, aged twenty-nine, was first on the roll, expressing his resolution to go to England &#145;Today rather than tomorrow&#146;.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1580 Sherwin left Rome in company with other priests, including Edmund Campion and Robert Persons. He arrived in England some time in August, but in the following November he was captured while preaching in the London home of Nicholas Roscarrock, another alumnus of Exeter College. He was taken to the Marshalsea &#145;where he lay night and day in a great pair of shackles for the space of a month&#146;. He was transferred to the Tower, was racked twice and was offered a protestant bishopric if he would renounce his faith. Two of his letters written at this time are printed in William Allen's <span class="italic">Briefe Historie</span>.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1581 Sherwin was indicted with seven others, accused of having entered England for the purpose of raising a rebellion and overthrowing the queen. The trial took place in Westminster Hall. The chief proof on which the prosecution relied was the deposition of false witnesses. On 20 November Sherwin, Edmund Campion, and Alexander Briant were condemned to death by hanging, drawing, and quartering, the penalty for common traitors. Two days before he died Sherwin remarked to Campion, pointing to the sun, &#145;Ah Campion I shall shortly be above yonder fellow&#146;. On 1 December 1581 he was dragged on a hurdle from the Tower to Tyburn where, after the short customary address to the crowd, in which he prayed for the queen, he said he was not guilty of any crime except being a Catholic. Before being hanged he kissed the hands of his executioner which were still wet with the blood of Campion who had just met a similar death.<br>
<br>Sherwin was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970. He is venerated as the proto-martyr of the English College, Rome.<br>
