<span class="headword">Closse,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1571&#150;1621), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is of unknown origins. First recorded in 1571, when he matriculated as sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was incorporated as BA from Oxford and proceeded MA in 1579. In 1581 he attempted to become vicar of Cuckfield, Sussex. This benefice had recently been the subject of much controversy, culminating in the deprivation of its incumbent, who was also Bishop Curteys's brother. Closse tried to take advantage of this by persuading Archbishop Grindal to present him on the grounds of the living's vacancy, even though Curteys had already presented one Alexander Southwick. Grindal's chancellor instituted Closse on 14 June 1581, but he was unable to take effective possession, and by 14 September 1582 he had been deprived, having also been summoned before the privy council. It is probable that Closse's next move was to the relatively wealthy parish of Black Torrington, Devon, in 1582, although his payment of first fruits did not commence until 1586. In the intervening years he appears to have been preacher at St Magnus the Martyr, London. Called upon at short notice to preach at Paul's Cross on 6 March 1586, Closse took the opportunity to reprove the lord mayor, Sir Wolstan Dixie, for partiality in a cause which he had been instrumental in placing before Dixie the previous Friday. Dixie summoned Closse to answer for this at Guildhall, and it was concluded that a complaint should be laid before Archbishop John Whitgift, who ordered Closse to preach again on 27 March to make submission.<br>
<br>Before a large auditory Closse explained that his previous attack on bribery did not apply to the city magistrates, and explained the cause of his earlier outburst. He was seeking to help the wife of a Flemish resident who wanted to retain her servant boy, whom his mother wished to reclaim by sending a city officer to seize him: violent actions and words had ensued and with Closse's help all parties had gone to the magistrate's house, where the mother's case was upheld. It was this seeming injustice which had aroused Closse's earlier wrath, and he made no real apology in this later sermon. Although the six examining clergy agreed there was no further case against Closse, Dixie took the matter to privy council, which after some prompting judged that Closse had indeed insulted him and should be suspended from preaching in London diocese for a year. Closse's own account of the affair, prepared for a new edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, claims that he would have accepted the council's wish for a private reconciliation, but that Dixie insisted on pursuing the matter.<br>
<br>In October 1585 Closse's wife bore him a daughter, who, however, died in June 1586; following this loss and his suspension, the couple retreated to his Devon parish, where eight more children were born, three of them dying in infancy. In 1606 Closse published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Parricide Papist</span>, describing a Catholic son's murder of his protestant father at Padstow. He also became incumbent of the neighbouring parish of Bradford in 1591, and offered employment there to another clergyman, William Rickard, allegedly as a bribe: Closse wished him to deny that while Rickard was a prisoner in Exeter gaol Closse had entered the prison in disguise to consort with Jane Beaton, another prisoner. Many statements were made in Star Chamber over this and related matters between 1608 and 1621. There were accusations by Closse at an assize sermon of venality among the judges and false charges against him aided by falsified letters, charges that Jane Beaton had a child by Closse, who had bought drugs to kill it. The result was Closse's deprivation and degradation in 1615 while in the Fleet prison under a two-year sentence. No more is known of Closse after his final answers in Star Chamber in 1621. While there are no proven links between the Cambridge graduate, the intruder at Cuckfield, the Paul's Cross preacher, and the minister of Black Torrington, the name and provocative behaviour would seem to be a common factor.<br>
