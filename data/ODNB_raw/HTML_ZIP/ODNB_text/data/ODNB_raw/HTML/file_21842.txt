<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Penington, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584?, <em>d.</em> 1646), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Robert Penington (<i>d</i>. 1612) of Henham in Essex, described as a tanner. It has been suggested that his mother was Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barfoot, and that he was baptized at Henham on 30 January 1568, but the circumstances of Penington's later career make it likely that he was born to Robert's second wife, Elizabeth, and that he was the John Penington who was baptized at Henham on 9 August 1584.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Penington's early career is shrouded in obscurity. In June 1629 he recalled having captained ships for twenty years, although his naval service did not begin until 1621. He may have been the John Penington of Newhaven, Sussex, &#145;merchant&#146;, who embarked on a voyage to west Africa in 1612, and perhaps also the Captain Penington whose man-of-war was seized by the French off southern Italy in 1616. In 1617&#150;18 he served as vice-admiral in Sir Walter Ralegh's ill-fated expedition to the Orinoco in search of a goldmine. Although Penington took no part in the attack on the Spanish settlement of St Thomas's, his ship, the <i>Star</i> of London (240 tons), was impounded at Kinsale on the way home in 1618 by order of the lord deputy, and in London Penington himself was thrown into prison. He subsequently helped to condemn Ralegh to the scaffold as, with another of the expedition's captains, he revealed that Ralegh had &#145;proposed the taking of the Mexico fleet if the mine failed&#146;  (Harlow, 300).<br>
<br>Penington claimed to have lost his entire fortune, amounting to &pound;2500, in the Orinoco expedition, and on his release, which occurred some time before 6 October 1618, he sought gainful employment. He now enjoyed an enviable reputation for seamanship, Ralegh having described him in March 1618 as &#145;one of the sufficientest gentlemen for the sea England hath&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 290, fol. 4<i>v</i>). During the latter months of 1618 and through 1619 he repeatedly requested command of the next fleet to be set out by the East India Company. His applications were unsuccessful, but he attracted the attention of the new lord high admiral, George Villiers, marquess (subsequently duke) of Buckingham, who supported his applications to the company and then commissioned him as captain of an armed merchantman in the 1620&#150;21 expedition against Algiers under Sir Robert Mansell. He evidently served with distinction, as on his return to England he was made flag captain to the earl of Oxford, who commanded a small squadron in the channel. However, he came out of pay on 18 May 1622 and received no further naval employment for three years. During this time he kept himself in readiness &#145;to do my King and country service when they shall call me unto it&#146;  (Centre for Kentish Studies, U269/1/OE1007). In August 1624 he obtained from the king a thirty-one-year lease of rents arriving from lands scattered though eleven counties, worth &pound;150 per annum, thereby acquiring a regular income.<h2>
<a name="Wartimeservice16251629"></a>Wartime service, 1625&#150;1629</h2>In the spring of 1625 Penington commanded a squadron comprising a king's ship, the <i>Vanguard</i>, and seven armed merchantmen. These ships had been promised as loans to the French king, Louis XIII, to help quell the rebellion of the count of Soubise. However, neither Charles I nor Buckingham actually wanted them to be employed to suppress French protestantism. They hoped that by the time Penington's squadron reached France the Huguenots would have made peace with Louis, thereby allowing Penington's ships to be used in a combined Anglo-French military and naval operation against the Spanish satellite state of Genoa. He was accordingly given strict instructions to avoid involvement in France's civil wars. On his arrival at Dieppe in mid-June, however, he was ordered by the admiral of France to transport 1700 French troops to La Rochelle for service against the Huguenots. Penington was horrified, and returned to England, an action approved of by his superiors. He was nevertheless ordered back to Dieppe in mid-July, whereupon he asked to be relieved of his command. Buckingham feigned anger at this request, which he refused, but was secretly delighted by his subordinate's reluctance to co-operate with the French as there was as yet no confirmation of rumours that the Huguenots had agreed peace terms with Louis. Penington continued to give the duke secret cause for satisfaction, for at the end of July he connived at a mutiny by his crew which resulted in him returning to England for a second time. It was not until 5 August, when Buckingham and Charles were misled into thinking that Louis had made peace with the Huguenots, that Penington's ships (bar one) were transferred to French control.<br>
<br>Soon after he returned to England Penington was ordered to mount a blockade of Dunkirk, but a storm in mid-October scattered his ships and more than twenty Dunkirkers evaded his net. Buckingham did not blame Penington for this failure, and at the beginning of 1626 he ordered him to fit out thirty ships at Plymouth with the aim of assisting Soubise, who had been defeated in a naval engagement in September 1625 and was now regarded as England's ally. Over the next five months Penington strained his own finances to equip this fleet, but he was hampered by acute shortages of men, money, and victuals, and became despondent that he seldom heard from Buckingham, &#145;for I do not only honour my lord but love him as a young man doth his mistress, and am jealous of his favours, or the contrary&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/23/25). Buckingham was not indifferent to Penington's difficulties, however, but was distracted by parliament, where his enemies accused him, among other things, of contributing to the military problems of the Huguenots by lending warships to Louis XIII. On 6 May 1626 Penington, having played a key role in the loan of the ships, was summoned by Buckingham to Westminster to give evidence, during which absence part of his fleet mutinied for want of pay and clothing. By the time he returned to his station the mutiny had fizzled out. Charles and Buckingham now abandoned their planned assistance of Soubise and resolved instead that Penington's fleet should form the nucleus of a fresh expedition to Spain under Lord Willoughby, with Penington as its rear-admiral. Willoughby's fleet was no better prepared than Penington's had been, however, and by the time the expedition sailed from Falmouth on 7 October, Penington was predicting the overthrow of the voyage, &#145;the time of the year being so far spent and we being now victualled but for ten weeks&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/37/49). His pessimism proved well founded, for in the Bay of Biscay the fleet encountered storms which sent it hurrying back to England. The outcry which greeted Willoughby's premature return led to the creation of a commission of inquiry, of which Penington was a member, but he attended only one of its meetings (on 22 December) before he was ordered back to sea, this time as admiral of a fleet of twenty ships provided by the city of London. Relations with France were now at a low ebb and he was instructed to intercept several warships built in the Netherlands for the fledgeling French navy reported to be anchored off Havre de Grace. There he was to provoke a quarrel so as to capture or sink the French ships. However, on his arrival in the Downs he found only fifteen ships rather than the twenty he had been promised, and that none were suitable for use as men-of-war. After an unsuccessful attempt to cross the channel on 29 December, he dutifully scoured the French coast. By the time he learned of the whereabouts of the French, on 14 January 1627, the time allotted to his ships for their naval service had nearly expired and he was therefore unable to mount an attack.<br>
<br>Soon after the city ships were discharged, Penington was appointed (on 19 February) admiral of a squadron with orders to escort several detained French vessels from the western ports to the Thames and to sweep the channel clean of all enemy shipping. He carried out these instructions in spectacular fashion, taking twenty French prizes and bringing home goods and shipping valued at &pound;128,600. Buckingham was delighted with this haul, which enabled him to complete his preparations for an assault on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in support of the Huguenots of La Rochelle. He accordingly ordered Penington to receive &pound;1000 in recognition of his valuable service and bestowed on him the captaincy of Sandown Castle, at an annual salary of &pound;20.<br>
<br>Shortly after the English landed at R&eacute;, Penington, who commanded a squadron in Buckingham's fleet, offered to attempt to free the wine fleet which had been arrested at Bordeaux. However, Buckingham objected that he would first need to secure the nearby island of Oleron, from where it was feared the French king would mount a counter-attack. In the event, Penington was merely detailed to &#145;guard&#146; Oleron, but he proved powerless to prevent the French from building up their forces there, and as a result Buckingham's army was swept off R&eacute; at the end of October. He returned to England ill and short of money, having received neither pay for the past eighteen months nor the promised &pound;1000 reward. He was also thoroughly worn out, having been at sea almost continuously for the past two and a half years. In December he asked Buckingham to appoint him surveyor of the ordnance office, a position sufficiently remunerative to keep him from badgering Buckingham for money while still enabling him to &#145;be near and ready upon all occasions to attend your grace's commands&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/89/59). Buckingham was not yet ready to dispense with Penington's naval services, but he was willing to allow his subordinate a well-earned rest from sea service. Penington accordingly took no part in the earl of Denbigh's unsuccessful attempt to relieve La Rochelle in the spring of 1628, but instead was commissioned with the shipwright Phineas Pett to oversee the construction of ten small ships which were required both to row and sail. He discharged this role with his customary energy, and the new ships were launched later that year as the <i>Lion's Whelps</i>. Buckingham also ensured that he was paid the &pound;1000 reward he was owed, and helped him to a royal grant of the Buckinghamshire manor of Hanslope, which Penington coveted owing to its proximity to one of the duke's residences.<br>
<br>By mid-July 1628 a refreshed Penington was back in harness, having been appointed to command a squadron in the fleet which Buckingham himself was preparing to lead to La Rochelle. In the event, he took no part in this expedition, which went ahead despite Buckingham's murder on 23 August. Penington had lionized Buckingham, and the duke's death must therefore have been a shattering blow to him. Buckingham's successors, the admiralty commissioners, enjoyed no such close relationship with Penington, and when in May 1629 they drew up a list of the captains for employment at sea that year they excluded him from it. His name was nevertheless inserted by the king, who placed him in command of a squadron to blockade the Elbe in support of the Danes. However, when news arrived that Denmark had concluded peace with the emperor his commission was revoked. His subsequent dispatches were ignored by the admiralty commissioners, much to his bemusement, as &#145;I am sure I have given no just cause of distaste to any either by neglecting my employment or otherwise&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/147/2).<h2>
<a name="The1630s"></a>The 1630s</h2>Once again Penington had found himself cast aside by the navy but in May 1631 he was unexpectedly appointed admiral of the narrow seas, the admiralty commissioners being disgruntled with the previous incumbent, Sir Henry Mervyn. Penington settled into his new role with his customary energy, and it was not long before the leading admiralty commissioner, Lord Treasurer Portland, expressed complete satisfaction with his performance. He remained admiral of the channel squadron for the next three years. By April 1632 he was also a gentleman-in-ordinary of the privy chamber, and two years later he was knighted aboard his flagship by the king.<br>
<br>As rear-admiral in 1635 Penington was disappointed by the failure of the first ship money fleet to confront the French. On learning that the king intended to set out another fleet the following year, Penington hoped that it would achieve more than the first, &#145;or the money were as well saved as spent&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1635</i>, 316). He served as admiral of the winter guard in 1635&#150;6 and as vice-admiral of the second ship money fleet in 1636, when he also subscribed a series of criticisms of the navy's ships and provisions drawn up by the fleet's young commander, the earl of Northumberland. He retained the rank of vice-admiral in 1637 and again in 1638, when Northumberland's ill health caused Penington to be the senior officer at sea.<br>
<br>By 1638 Penington was in his mid-fifties and Northumberland, who was appointed lord high admiral in March, expected him to retire soon from sea service to make way for a younger man. When the surveyorship of the navy fell vacant in August, Northumberland therefore offered it to Penington, but the office was unprofitable and Penington apparently turned it down. Thereafter his relationship with the new lord admiral quickly deteriorated. In December, for instance, he was upbraided for taking his orders from one of the secretaries of state rather than from Northumberland, an offence he had committed in the previous year. Penington resented this admonition and privately complained to the former admiralty secretary Edward Nicholas that he could expect no better treatment &#145;so long as some are at the helm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638&#150;9</i>, 188). His fears were justified, as Northumberland's response to the news that he had complained to the marquess of Hamilton about defects in some of his vessels in 1639 indicates. Penington, as admiral of a much reduced ship money fleet, had been ordered to transport Hamilton's army to Scotland to oppose the covenanters. Northumberland advised Hamilton &#145;not to give too much credit to what he tells you of this nature&#146;, being &#145;well acquainted with Sir John Penington's aptness to take up reports upon very slight information (which when they come to be examined never prove true)&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/1/1082).<br>
<br>Although held in low regard by Northumberland, Penington was an able and experienced seaman with a long record of loyal service, even if he was also a born grouser. His abilities were amply demonstrated in the following month when he reported that he had blocked up the Scottish forces in Leith harbour so &#145;that they cannot stir in or out with a boat but we snap them up, which does infinitely perplex and trouble them more than all the King's army&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639</i>, 210). The simmering feud between Penington and Northumberland was exacerbated in the autumn of 1639, however, after a large Spanish fleet was chased into Dover Road by the Dutch navy. For some years England had attempted to exercise sovereignty over its adjoining seas by policing them with large fleets. English claims to sovereignty would be exposed as hollow if the Spanish and Dutch came to blows in sight of the English fleet, yet there was nothing that Penington could do to prevent this as his force was too small. This was appreciated by Northumberland's admiralty secretary, Thomas Smith, who advised Penington to make a pretence of protecting the Spanish while not actually exposing his ships to any hazard.<br>
<br>Early on the morning of 11 October Penington consulted his captains after the Dutch admiral signalled to the rest of his fleet to engage the Spanish. They resolved to get to the windward of the Dutch, who, anticipating this manoeuvre, detached a portion of their fleet to maintain a watchful eye on the English. As the fight developed a Dutch captain remonstrated that the Spanish had fired first, but Penington retorted that the Dutch had provoked the battle by approaching so close with their fireships. In the ensuing confusion the English captured two Dutch vessels, but Penington, perhaps heeding Smith's sound advice, recommended to his captains that they should be released as &#145;they were no considerable satisfaction for his majesty for the affront done unto him&#146;  (P. White, <span class="italic">A Memorable Sea-Fight</span>, 1649, 46) and would merely provoke the Dutch, whose fleet was five times stronger than theirs. His captains took little persuading of the wisdom of this advice, and the two vessels were accordingly released. Penington was widely censured for this decision after the battle, and also for failing to ride close to the Dutch ships to prevent them from attacking the Spanish. Indeed, though roundly defended in public by Northumberland, privately the earl complained that &#145;Penington hath behaved himself basely&#146;  (BL, microfilm M285, fol. 235<i>v</i>), and soon after the battle tensions between the two men resurfaced, this time over the gathering-up of valuable wreckage to which Northumberland laid claim as lord admiral. On 30 October Penington was rebuked for making &#145;so much ado about a business wherein you had such punctual instructions&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 62).<h2>
<a name="Kingandparliament16401646"></a>King and parliament, 1640&#150;1646</h2>Penington was admiral of the last of the ship money fleets in 1640, and reverted to his former title as admiral of the narrow seas in 1641. In May 1641 the exchequer was ordered to allow him &pound;3000 in recognition of his services, but a depleted treasury was unable to find the money. By 1642 Penington, finally tired of sea service, asked his friend Edward Nicholas to persuade the king to appoint him treasurer of the navy alongside the gouty and aged Sir William Russell. Penington was by now wealthy enough to serve in that office: in July 1640 he valued his estate for the purposes of his will at more than &pound;13,732 in cash and loans. Much of this fortune had undoubtedly been derived from convoy money&#151;the payments made by Spain in the later 1630s to the captains of the ship money fleets in return for the safe convoy of their treasure ships into Dunkirk harbour&#151;but Penington had also profited from moneylending, a business carried on for him while he was at sea by his second cousin, the London alderman Isaac Penington. However, Charles resolved to maintain Russell as sole treasurer for the time being because Penington was more useful to him at sea. Indeed, it was Penington who spirited Lord Digby across the channel for him in January 1642, at which time Penington also secretly pledged to refer all his instructions to the king for his approval.<br>
<br>The part played by Penington in Digby's escape infuriated Northumberland, whose authority he had again bypassed. On 18 January the lord admiral sent Penington a curt letter requiring him to report to parliament, &#145;which is all I have to say at present&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/488/70). After consulting the king, Penington gave evidence to the Commons, whose speaker thanked him for an &#145;ingenuous confession&#146;  (Coates, Young, and Snow, 176). However, his explanation that he had been obliged to follow Charles's orders because he was employed by the king under the lord admiral was not well received. On 23 February Charles ordered Penington to accompany the queen to the Netherlands, where he was kept in her service until 23 March. His absence provided further proof that he was taking his orders directly from Charles, and therefore on 10 March the Commons resolved that the king should be asked to employ the earl of Warwick in his stead that summer. Charles refused to countenance their request, however, and later rebuffed a petition to the same effect from both houses.<br>
<br>Penington came out of pay on 5 April and subsequently joined the king at York. By the end of June the fleet was in Warwick's hands, but Charles was still determined to install Penington. However, Penington only hesitantly agreed to help oust Warwick. According to Clarendon, he feared capture and was in considerable &#145;perplexity&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.225), while the royalist writer David Lloyd considered that he had been &#145;deluded by the faction&#146;  (Lloyd, 646), whose ranks included Isaac Penington. Whatever the reasons for his reluctance, Penington, instead of proceeding to the Downs himself, sent instructions to the aged comptroller of the navy, Sir Henry Palmer, a former seagoing officer who lived close by, to take command of the fleet on his behalf. Meanwhile, a royal courier required Warwick's captains to place themselves under Penington's orders. Clarendon relates that the captains received this message &#145;with great duty and submission&#146; and stayed only to receive Penington's instructions. However none were forthcoming because Penington would not venture aboard ship until Palmer had signalled that it was safe to do so, and Palmer had not yet arrived, allegedly because he was unwell. Amid this confusion Warwick, who had been feasting ashore, learned of the king's message. Returning hastily to his flagship, the earl summoned his captains to him, and took prisoner those who refused to obey his commands. By the time Palmer arrived the game was up.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of civil war Penington was appointed an ordnance commissioner by the king. In August 1642 Charles finally agreed to appoint him joint treasurer of the navy, which was now largely in parliament's hands. Following the royalist capture of Bristol in July 1643 he was designated admiral of the fleet, with instructions to keep open the Bristol Channel and communications with south Wales and Ireland. By early August he had readied a force of eighteen ships at Bristol, where he remained until at least April 1645. What became of him after Fairfax stormed the city in September is uncertain. According to Lloyd he died at Bristol in September 1646; he was certainly dead by 28 May 1648, when his will of 1645 was proved. In this he divided up his fortune of more than &pound;13,500 in cash and &pound;1000 in plate among various relatives and friends, having never married.<br>
