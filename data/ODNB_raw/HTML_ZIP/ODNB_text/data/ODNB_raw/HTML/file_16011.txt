<span class="headword">Langdon,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1434), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was a native of Kent and had at least two brothers, Thomas and Richard, both laymen; others of the surname, derived from a local village, were either in his circle, or employees of Canterbury Cathedral and diocese, or both. He was a close friend of Bishop John Cliderow of Bangor, who was a native of Romney. Admitted as a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1398, Langdon was ordained to minor orders in April and May 1401, and as priest on 24 May 1404. He graduated BTh of Oxford by 1400, and DTh by August 1411. Although he served as sub-prior of his house some time before 1411, and as its almoner by 1 December that year, he was often at Oxford; he was a scholar of Canterbury College (which was connected with his house) in 1407&#150;8, warden there from September 1410 to after August 1411, and again a scholar in 1414&#150;15. By then he had become widely known. He gave the opening sermon in the convocation of Canterbury on both 17 February 1410 and 1 December 1411, evidently as a preacher of reputation and perhaps engaged in opposing Wycliffite heresy. He acted as commissary for the chancellor of Oxford in 1410 or 1411, and was one of twelve Oxford scholars appointed by Archbishop Arundel in 1411 to examine the writings of Wyclif  (Wilkins, 3.339&#150;49), and also one of Arundel's five commissaries instructed on 23 June 1411 to take oaths from Oxford scholars to renounce Wyclif's errors.<br>
<br>On 12 March 1414 Langdon announced the election of Henry Chichele as archbishop, having played a prominent part in its process. He attended the Council of Constance, quite possibly throughout its duration and probably on behalf of his house, which on 1 November 1417 appointed him as its proctor in the curia of the new pope, Martin V. In fact he did not go to Rome, being used instead, by his own estimation, for nearly three years in France and Normandy by Henry V and Archbishop Chichele, mainly to report back to the council in England. The king and archbishop tried to have him provided as bishop of Lisieux in 1419, but the pope preferred to favour an Italian cardinal, Branda da Castiglione. Langdon was in England in March 1419, and again in October 1419 and April 1421, when twice more he gave the opening sermon in convocation, while in February 1420, May 1421, and February 1423 he took part as an examiner in the trial of the heretic William Taylor. On 17 November 1421 he was provided to the see of Rochester and consecrated on 7 June 1422 at Canterbury. Modest though the see was, undoubtedly its location was ideal for Langdon, as was its particular connection with Canterbury; Langdon had continued to be used as a proctor by his house whenever and wherever possible.<br>
<br>After Henry V's death Langdon was named to the regency council, on about 5 November 1422, although he rarely attended during the first seven and a half years. He attended the Council of Pavia&#150;Siena from early summer to late 1424, defending the religious orders against reformist critics. He presided over the convocation of Canterbury on 27 April 1426, preached the opening sermon yet again (when heresy was the principal item on the agenda) on 5 July 1428, and presided on 10, 12, and 14 July. On 15 November 1428 he was appointed to a committee of convocation to develop more effective measures against heresy. In these years he worked almost entirely from Trottiscliffe in his diocese, and evidently in good harmony with his archbishop. From April 1430 Langdon attended regularly at the king's council, and accompanied Henry VI to France for his coronation. In February 1432 he was appointed to an embassy to Charles VII of France, and thereafter he hardly saw his diocese. On 17 July following he was appointed to the first English delegation to the Council of Basel, but, instead, was in France on a mission to Charles VII from late December 1432 to February 1433, and then in England for the rest of the year. On 18 February 1434 he was appointed to the second delegation to Basel, but was still in England on 5 June, when he was appointed to speak once more with Charles VII. He left England a week later, inevitably with an extra commission to represent Christ Church, Canterbury, at the council. This time he did reach Basel. He died there on 30 September. He had made his will on 2 March 1434, supposing (like Bishop Polton two years earlier) that he might never return from such a complacently indefinite assembly; both were right. In his will he concentrated on his family and upon the cathedrals of Rochester and Canterbury, his lifelong environment, and asked for burial in the lady chapel of Rochester. He was in fact buried in the choir of the Carthusian monastery at Basel. His will was proved only on 27 June 1437, which may explain why his wish to be brought home was not met. Thomas Rodeburne in the preface to his <span class="italic">Historia minor</span>, says that he used a collection by Langdon of historical material; there is no trace of this or of Langdon's evidently influential sermons.<br>
