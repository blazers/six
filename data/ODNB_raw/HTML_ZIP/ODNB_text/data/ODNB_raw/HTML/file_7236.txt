<span class="headword">Davies,  Griffith</span>  (1788&#150;1855), <span class="occ">actuary</span>, son of Owen Davies (1761&#150;1854), farmer and quarryman, and his wife, Mary William, was born at T&#375; Croes, at the foot of Cilgwyn Mountain, in the parish of Llandwrog, Caernarvonshire, on 28 December 1788. He was taught to read and spell in Welsh at the Sunday school of Brynrodyn Chapel, Llandwrog. At the age of seven he began learning English at an English school at Llanwnda. He subsequently discovered a special aptitude for arithmetic, but his parents' poverty obliged him to work as a farm labourer, horse driver, and quarryman. He was often seen with an iron pen, covering slates with arithmetical calculations, and he attended elementary school, though only for short periods.<br>
<br>Desirous of improving his English, which was still very limited, Davies sailed for London in September 1809. There he attended a school to perfect his writing and grammar, and in January 1810 secured an appointment as a teacher of arithmetic at a salary of &pound;20 p.a. In his spare time he started calculating the times of the eclipses and exhibiting their mode of occurrence by diagrams. He opened a school of his own in the summer of 1811 in James Street, Old Street; in the following year he moved into a better house in Lizard Street, Bartholomew Square, in the parish of St Luke, and joined the Mathematical Society in Crispin Street, Spitalfields. Davies published, in 1814, his <span class="italic">Key to Bonnycastle's Trigonometry</span>, which made his name as a mathematician and brought many pupils to his school; these included the explorer John Franklin, who was keen to increase his knowledge of the mathematics of navigation, and also several employees of insurance offices. This led to actuarial work and contact with William Morgan, the actuary of the Equitable, who furnished him with a certificate of actuarial competency. In 1820 Davies was awarded the large silver medal of the Society of Arts for an ingenious sundial which he had constructed.<br>
<br>In 1821 the projectors of the Guardian Assurance Company applied to Davies for advice and assistance when drawing up their constitution, and he was engaged to construct the necessary life tables. Towards the end of 1823 he was appointed the regular and permanent actuary of the Guardian at an annual salary of &pound;150, an appointment which he held for the rest of his life. He constructed the first of many life tables for the newly established Reversionary Interest Society in 1823. Two years later he published <span class="italic">Tables of Life Contingencies</span>, which provided an extensive scale of premiums for life assurance. He also introduced a pioneering remodelling of the columnar method of constructing mortality tables devised by George Barrett.<br>
<br>In 1812 Davies married Mary Holbut, the sister of one of his pupils. They had four daughters, but only one survived childhood. Mary died in 1836, and in February 1841 Davies married Mrs Mary Glynne (<i>d</i>. 1848), a widow, daughter of Euan Owen; they had a son, also called Griffith, who became an actuary like his father.<br>
<br>Davies's fame spread and on 16 June 1831, on the recommendation of Benjamin Gompertz, the astronomer and actuary, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1843 he was one of the proponents of the publication of mortality tables based on data collected from all the life offices. When the Institute of Actuaries was founded in 1848 Davies declined the honour of being its first president (he was already then becoming something of a recluse), but the institute recognized him as &#145;the father of the present race of actuaries&#146;  (Chambers, 70). The actuarial consultancy work that Davies undertook during the latter part of his career added to his reputation. In 1829 the directors of the East India Company submitted the documents concerning the Bombay military fund for his investigation and report, for which he was paid &pound;3000. From that time until 1851 his actuarial advice was regularly sought on the various Indian funds. He wrote no fewer than twenty reports on them, each containing extensive insurance tables. He was also engaged from time to time for the Bank of England. This private practice was extremely lucrative; Davies also received &pound;850 p.a. from the Guardian company and &pound;150 p.a. from the Reversionary Interest Society.<br>
<br>Griffith Davies was a man of deep religious feelings, and belonged to a chapel of Welsh Calvinistic Methodists in Jewin Street, Cripplegate. In his final years he absented himself from all society save that of the chapel and his office. On 5 December 1854 he was seized with a paralytic stroke, and he died at 25 Duncan Terrace, Islington, London, on 21 March 1855. He was survived by a son and a daughter, and was buried at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington.<br>
