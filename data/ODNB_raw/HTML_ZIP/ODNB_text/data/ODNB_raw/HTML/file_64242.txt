<span class="headword">Sausmarez,  Lionel Maurice  de</span>  (1915&#150;1969), <span class="occ">painter and writer on art</span>, was born on 20 October 1915 in Sydney, Australia, the second son of Clarence Montgomery de Sausmarez (1880&#150;1918), a marine engineer of an old and distinguished naval family from Guernsey, and Jessie Rose Macdonald, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bamford (1878&#150;1963). She was the widow of an explorer, and had become a professional pianist and teacher. The family moved to Grenada in the West Indies when Maurice was one year old, and he was first educated there before attending St Michael's, Highgate, when the family moved to England, and then going to Harvest Road primary school, Willesden. He was awarded a scholarship to Christ's Hospital in 1926. At school he excelled in playing the piano and organ as well as in art.<br>
<br>From 1932 to 1936 de Sausmarez attended Willesden Art School and from there had to choose whether to go to the Royal College of Music or to study art; in the event he became a royal exhibitioner at the Royal College of Art (1936&#150;9). He won a continuation scholarship in 1939 but relinquished it because of the outbreak of war. That year he married Kate Elizabeth Lyons (<i>d</i>. 2000), with whom he had a daughter. During the war he was exempt from military service as he had suffered rheumatic fever as a child, and became a volunteer firefighter in Sheffield when teaching at the Edward VII School.<br>
<br>De Sausmarez's first one-man show of paintings was at the Paul Alexander Gallery in Kensington in 1949. He was commissioned by the Pilgrim Trust to contribute work to <span class="italic">Recording Britain</span>, the four illustrated volumes of which were eventually published between 1946 and 1949. He also began showing in mixed exhibitions, which included those of the Royal Academy (from 1945), the New English Art Club (member, 1950), the Royal Society of British Artists (member, 1953), the Leicester Galleries, and the London Group.<br>
<br>From 1942 de Sausmarez taught part-time at Harrow School, Goldsmiths' College, and the Willesden, City and Guilds, and Camberwell schools of art. He became chairman of the Artists' International Association (1946&#150;8), and helped to establish its permanent home in Lisle Street. In 1947 he became head of the school of drawing and painting at Leeds College of Art, and in 1950 was invited to set up the department of fine art at the University of Leeds, as its first head, a post he held until 1959. Leeds City Art Gallery possesses three of his paintings of this period, including <span class="italic">Winter</span> (oil on canvas, <i>c</i>.1955). His work is also in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull, Bedford Art Gallery, the Whitworth Art Gallery, the City of Wakefield Art Gallery, and the National Gallery of New Zealand, Wellington. He had pictures in Contemporary Art Society exhibitions at the Tate Gallery in 1951 and 1956.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s de Sausmarez had a close relationship with Bridget Riley, who became one of the most distinguished abstract painters of her generation, and about whom he later wrote a book (<span class="italic">Bridget Riley</span>, 1970). He was appointed head of fine art at Hornsey School of Art in 1958, and in 1962 became principal of the Byam Shaw School of Drawing and Painting, a post in which he remained until his death.<br>
<br>As a painter, de Sausmarez's work was characterized by a classical approach to composition, and he was preoccupied with the use of colour to explore light and space. A fine draughtsman, his earlier work included landscapes, still lifes, interiors, and a number of commissioned portraits, including those of Vice-Chancellor Nicholson of the University of Hull and the poet James Kirkup. He later mostly painted landscapes directly from the motif, and he also worked in the studio from colour studies and drawings, on compositions which became essays in fragmented and faceted shapes, analogous to those of Jacques Villon, whose works, after those of C&eacute;zanne and Poussin, he particularly admired. In 1964 he was elected associate of the Royal Academy and in that year also published his widely acclaimed and frequently reprinted book <span class="italic">Basic Design: the Dynamics of Visual Form</span> (1964). He subsequently wrote books on Poussin (<span class="italic">Poussin's Orpheus and Eurydice</span>, 1969) and on his friend Ben Nicholson (1969), as well as giving broadcast talks and writing many articles on the visual arts and on art education. A deep commitment to art teaching led him to become president of the Society for Education through Art, and he was a member of the Council for Diplomas in Art and Design from 1968, among many other official appointments.<br>
<br>De Sausmarez travelled before the war in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, and later in Italy and east Africa. He had a house in the Vaucluse from 1962 and subsequently worked there every year. In 1963 he was divorced from his first wife and in May that year he married, second, Jane Elisabeth Boswell (<i>b</i>. 1938), artist and printmaker, with whom he had two sons. Having bought a house in north London in 1943, he lived there, in Leaside Avenue, for the rest of his life after his years in Yorkshire. He was a handsome, saturnine man, tall and slim, who wore a beard at earlier periods in his life. He died in London of heart trouble on 27 October 1969, and was cremated at Golders Green. A thanksgiving service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 15 December of that year. His second wife survived him. A memorial group of his pictures was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1970.<br>
