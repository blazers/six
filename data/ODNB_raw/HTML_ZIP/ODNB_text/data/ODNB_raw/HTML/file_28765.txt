<span class="headword">Warner,  Richard</span>  (1713?&#150;1775), <span class="occ">botanist and literary scholar</span>, was born in London, the third son of John Warner (1663&#150;1721), goldsmith and banker, in business in the Strand, near Temple Bar. John Warner, sheriff of London in 1640, and lord mayor in 1648, in which year he was knighted, was probably his great-grandfather. His father was a friend of Bishop Burnet and with his brother Robert, a barrister, purchased property in Clerkenwell, comprising what was afterwards Little Warner Street, Cold Bath Square, Great and Little Bath streets, and the surrounding area. In 1722 after his father's death, Richard Warner's mother bought Harts, an estate at Woodford, Essex, which, at her death in 1743, she left to him. On the death of his brother Robert about 1765 he also inherited the Clerkenwell property.<br>
<br>Warner entered Wadham College, Oxford, in July 1730 and graduated BA in 1734. He was<blockquote>bred to the law, and for some time had chambers in Lincoln's Inn; but, being possessed of an ample fortune, resided chiefly at a good old house [built 1617 by Sir Humphrey Handforth, master of the wardrobe to James I; demolished 1815] at Woodford Green, where he maintained a botanical garden, and was very successful in the cultivation of rare exotics. (Nichols, 75)</blockquote>Little, except a few trees and the remains of a mock ruin, survives. He was &#145;also in his youth, as is related of the great Linnaeus &hellip; remarkably fond of dancing; nor, till his passion for that diversion subsided, did he convert the largest room in his house into a library&#146;  (R. Pulteney, <span class="italic">Historical and Biographical Sketches of the Progress of Botany in England</span>, 1790, 2.283).<br>
<br>In 1748 Pehr Kalm, a pupil of Linnaeus, then on his way to collect plants in North America, visited Warner at Harts. Warner took him to London, to Peter Collinson's garden at Peckham, to visit Philip Miller at Chelsea, and to see the aged Sir Hans Sloane. In 1754 Warner received from the Cape of Good Hope the so-called Cape jasmine, actually the gardenia, a double-flowered form of a Chinese species, which flowered for the first time in his hothouse four years later. In a letter to Linnaeus, John Ellis (1710?&#150;1776) proposed that it should be called <i>Warneria</i>. Warner, however, objected because his friend Miller believed it to be a true jasmine, and Ellis named it <i>Gardenia</i>, now correctly <i>G. augusta</i> (Rubiaceae). Miller dedicated a genus based on the North American goldenseal to him in 1760, but that had been given the name <i>Hydrastis</i> by Linnaeus in the previous year, and so is known by that name.<br>
<br>Up until 1766 Warner, who had copies of all four early folio printings, had &#145;been long making collections for a new edition of Shakespeare; but on Mr [George] Steevens's advertisement of his design &hellip; he desisted&#146;  (Nichols, 75). In 1768 he published <span class="italic">A letter to David Garrick, esq., concerning a glossary to the plays of Shakespeare &hellip; to which is annexed a specimen</span>. Although turning aside to other studies, Warner was employed &#145;to the last hour of his life&#146; on this glossary, and bequeathed all papers relating to it to his &#145;friend David Garrick, esq. of Adelphi Buildings&#146;, that they might be published, and the profits, if any, applied to a fund for decayed actors. In a codicil, however, he left the papers absolutely at Garrick's disposal, and gave &pound;40 to the fund. Two manuscripts of this glossary, one in fifty-one quarto volumes, and the other in twenty octavo volumes, with an interleaved copy of Tonson's edition of Shakespeare (1734), with numerous manuscript notes by Warner, the original manuscript of the <span class="italic">Letter to Garrick</span>, and an alphabetical index of words requiring explanation in the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, are now in the British Library (Add. MSS 10464&#150;10543).<br>
<br>Warner also translated several plays of Plautus into prose, and the <span class="italic">Captives</span> into verse, before the announcement of Bonnell Thornton's version. In the preface to the two volumes published in 1766 Thornton writes that Warner,<blockquote>to whom I was then a stranger, was pleased to decline all thoughts which he had before conceived of prosecuting the same intention &hellip; communicating to me whatever he thought might be of service. &hellip; The same gentleman also took upon himself the trouble of translating the life of our author from Petrus Crinitus.</blockquote>On Thornton's death in May 1768 Warner issued a revised edition of the two volumes (1769), and then continued the work, translating fourteen plays and issuing them in three additional volumes, two published in 1772, and the last in 1774, the continuation being dedicated to Garrick.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Warner had, in 1771, printed his best-known work, <span class="italic">Plantae Woodfordienses: Catalogue of &hellip; Plants Growing Spontaneously about Woodford</span>. This little book had its origin in the &#145;herborisations&#146; of the Apothecaries' Company, to the master, wardens, and court of assistants of which it is dedicated. An index of Linnaean names is added. Though by no means free of errors, the <span class="italic">Plantae Woodfordienses</span> served as a model for Edward Jacob's <span class="italic">Plantae Favershamienses</span> (1777), and in 1784 Thomas Furly Forster thought it worthwhile to print some thirteen pages of &#145;Additions&#146;. In one of his own copies of the book, now at Wadham College, Warner had made several additions for an intended reissue.<br>
<br>Warner died, unmarried, on 11 April 1775, at Harts, and was buried on the 20th in the churchyard of St Mary's, Woodford Green, being probably, as stated in the register, &#145;aged 62&#146;, and not, as stated on his tomb, sixty-four. He bequeathed the bulk of his property to Jervoise Clarke-Jervoise, the widower of his niece Katherine (Kitty), second child of his brother Robert. Having been elected a director of the East India Company in 1760, he left &#145;as is customary&#146;, &pound;100 to its hospital at Poplar, &pound;50 to Garrick, and all books and drawings relating to botany and natural history to Wadham College, with &pound;300 to found a botanical exhibition at the college. Warner's books (over 4000 volumes), now at Wadham, comprise, besides several valuable botanical works, including presentation copies of Miller's works and other items from Miller's library, interleaved copies of Shakespeare, the works of Spenser, Milton, and Beaumont and Fletcher, and some small collections of dried plants of little intrinsic value. A collection of mosses and lichens made by him was presented by Sir Jervoise Clarke-Jervoise to the Essex Field Club.<br>
