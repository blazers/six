<span class="headword">Craghead,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1633&#150;1711), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and author</span>, was born in Scotland to unknown parents and graduated MA from the University of St Andrews in 1653. In 1658 he commenced his ministry in Donoughmore, co. Donegal. In 1661 he was one of thirty-six Presbyterian ministers in Ireland ejected from his parish for refusing to conform to the established church. He remained with his people and contrived to exercise an effective ministry among them. The troubles of 1689 drove him and his family into the besieged city of Londonderry, and from it to Glasgow, where for a time he ministered in a congregation.<br>
<br>On 1 July 1690 he was called to be minister of the Presbyterian congregation in Londonderry, and remained there until his death. The bishop of Derry from 1691 to 1702 was William King, afterwards archbishop of Dublin. King had already crossed swords with Joseph Boyse, minister of Wood Street congregation in Dublin, on the subject of Presbyterian worship, hoping to persuade his readers to follow his own pilgrimage from Presbyterianism to Anglicanism. His representations of Presbyterian practice were factually incorrect, and Craghead felt impelled to answer them in two pamphlets, <span class="italic">An Answer to a Late Book Intituled &#145;A Discourse Concerning the Inventions of Men in the Worship of God&#146;</span> (1694) and <span class="italic">An Answer to the Bishop of Derry's Second Admonition to the Dissenting Inhabitants of his Diocese</span> (1697). Neither work reveals Craghead as a particularly effective controversialist. His replies to King are orderly, thorough, and factual. They contain a wealth of information about Presbyterian life and spirituality, and especially about Presbyterian public worship. They confirm the very large numbers attending Presbyterian services in north-west Ulster at this time. While Boyse and Craghead display common purpose in their defence of Presbyterian forms of worship, it is fascinating to discern contrasting views on points of detail. Boyse reflects the broader and more English practice of Dublin Presbyterianism, while the stricter Ulster-Scot ethos of northern congregations is firmly embodied in Craghead's work. Craghead's pamphlets lack the grace of Boyse's writing, and the fire of good polemic, but are none the less an important contribution.<br>
<br>Craghead's other writings were of a devotional and practical kind. His <span class="italic">Advice for the Assurance of Salvation</span> (1702) and the posthumous <span class="italic">Walking with God</span> (1712) have both been lost to posterity. His <span class="italic">Advice to Communicants</span> was first published in Glasgow in 1695, and was reprinted several times. It was an attempt to deal with many of the problems and difficulties felt by the ordinary people with whom Craghead worked as a pastor. It is a rich treasure house of Christian devotion and evidences the scrupulous care given by Craghead and others of his generation to the doubts and questions of his people. Through all his writings runs a firm Calvinist theology. Craghead married Agnes, daughter of the Revd John Hart, minister of Taughboyne, and they had three sons: Thomas, Robert, and Samuel. Craghead died in Londonderry on 22 August 1711. His son <a name="cosubject_73741"></a><span class="headword">Robert Craghead</span>  (1684&#150;1738)<span class="occ"></span> received a classical education at local schools before studying philosophy at Glasgow (1700) and Edinburgh universities and divinity at Leiden, whence he graduated MA in 1702. Following his return to Ireland he was licensed by the Londonderry presbytery and ordained minister at Capel Street, Dublin, on 11 October 1709. He proved to be a popular preacher and served as moderator of the General Synod of Ulster in 1719. While orthodox in doctrine, he wrote in support of the non-subscribers in the controversy over subscription to the Westminster confession and attempted to reconcile the two parties. He remained minister at Capel Street until his death in Dublin on 31 July 1738. His elder brother, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1739), became minister of Donegal and Ballyshannon on 6 July 1698. In 1714 he emigrated to Boston on the ship <i>Thomas and Jane</i> and ministered in New England until his death in Hopewell in April 1739.<br>
