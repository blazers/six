<span class="headword">Sutton,  John Henry Thomas  Manners-</span>, third Viscount Canterbury  (1814&#150;1877), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17965/', "Charles Manners-Sutton, first Viscount Canterbury (1780&#150;1845)")</script>, politician, and his first wife, Lucy Maria Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1815), eldest daughter of John Denison of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, was born in Downing Street, London, on 27 May 1814. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1835. He gained a blue for cricket in 1836. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 18 September 1835, but was never called to the bar, and took his name off the books of the society on 25 November 1853. He was registrar of the court of faculties from 1834 until his death. Standing as a Conservative, in September 1839 he defeated Thomas Milner-Gibson at a by-election for the borough of Cambridge, but was subsequently unseated for bribery  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 45.293&#150;4). At the general election in June 1841 he was again returned for Cambridge, and from September 1841 until June 1846 he was Peel's under-secretary for the Home Office, but took little part in debates. In 1847, he first withdrew as a candidate for Cambridge in the face of protectionist opposition, then stood, and was defeated by the Liberal candidate. He stood for Harwich unsuccessfully in 1848, and with this his career in the Commons&#151;where he did not make the most of his opportunities&#151;ended.<br>
<br>In 1851 Manners-Sutton published the <span class="roman">Lexington Papers</span>, which had been discovered at Kelham, Nottinghamshire, in the library of his cousin, John Henry Manners-Sutton, MP for Newark. On 1 July 1854 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, a post which he retained until October 1861, when he was succeeded by Sir A. H. Gordon. He became governor of Trinidad on 24 June 1864, and on 19 May 1866 was promoted to the post of governor of Victoria, Australia. He was created KCB on 23 June, and assumed the office of governor on 15 August 1866. On the death of his elder brother, Charles John Manners-Sutton, in November 1869, he succeeded as third Viscount Canterbury. He resigned his post of governor of Victoria, where he had been very popular, in March 1873, and returned to England to his seat, Brooke House, Brooke, Norfolk. He played no significant role in the business of the House of Lords except to make occasional speeches on colonial affairs. He was created GCMG on 25 June 1873.<br>
<br>Manners-Sutton married, on 5 July 1838, Georgiana (<i>d</i>. 14 Sept 1899), youngest daughter of Charles Tompson of Witchingham Hall, Norfolk, and his wife, Juliana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kett. They had five sons&#151;the eldest of whom, Henry Charles, succeeded to the title&#151;and two daughters. Manners-Sutton died at his London home, 12 Queensberry Place, on 23 June 1877.<br>
