<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Ioan, John Thomas Rhaeadr Gwy]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1730, <em>d.</em> in or before 1806), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and Independent minister</span>, was born at Col, a cottage in Myddfai, Carmarthenshire, and was baptized on 25 April 1730, St Mark's day, at Myddfai parish church. He was the illegitimate son of Thomas Evan and an unnamed mother, but was brought up by a foster mother, who died in 1738, and subsequently by an aunt. His childhood was dominated by insecurity, ill health, and severe spiritual anxiety; his only education was three months at a local school. His interest in religion was aroused by reading devotional books and participating in the family devotions at Gellifelen, Myddfai, where, from the age of eleven, he served as a farm labourer. He then came into contact with the Methodist society at Cefn Telych, Myddfai, where he heard of Griffith Jones (1684&#150;1761), of Llanddowror, who later acceded to his request to become his servant. Since Griffith Jones sought to dissuade him from his ambition to prepare for the ministry, he turned to Howel Harris (1714&#150;1773) after hearing him preach at the house of Jethro Dafydd Evan at Llanddeusant. Harris enabled him to attend his school at Trefeca from November 1745 until the autumn of 1746. In 1750 Thomas preached for the first time at Cantref, near Brecon, and, at the Methodist Association at Carmarthen in 1752, he was accepted as an authorized preacher. For the next ten years he travelled widely, conducting circulating schools and preaching.<br>
<br>In 1761 Thomas became convinced that the Independent church view of church government best accorded with scripture and consequently became a dissenter. In that year he entered the nonconformist academy at Abergavenny, under the tuition of David Jardine. While there he was supported by grants from the Independent church fund board from April 1762 until January 1766. On 23 April 1767 he was ordained minister of the three Independent churches at Cae-bach, near Llandrindod, Rhaeadr Gwy, and Garn, all in Radnorshire. This brought him under the generous patronage of an admirer of Howel Harris, the wealthy Thomas Jones (<i>d</i>. 1782), of Trefonnen and Pencerrig, Radnorshire, whose uncle, Thomas Jones (1675&#150;1745), had built Cae-bach chapel in 1715. On 6 June 1768, in the parish church of Llanfynydd, Carmarthenshire, Thomas married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Jones (<i>d</i>. 1778) and his wife Diana (<i>d</i>. 1788), of Dyffryn Isa, Llanfynydd. They had three children: Ioan, born in April 1775, Elizabeth, who was born on 26 September 1781 but died of smallpox in November 1782, and Thomas, of whom nothing is known but that he was a wild character who enlisted in the army in 1795 and no more was heard of him.<br>
<br>During Thomas's visits to Trefeca, Selina, countess of Huntingdon, heard him preach and invited him to take services at the churches of her connexion in Brighton and Sussex, which he did during a two-month visit. He suffered much opposition at Cae-bach after a very flourishing period, and resigned his pastorate in 1778; he continued at his two other churches for a short period. Thereafter he lived an unsettled life and moved house no fewer than eight times between 1775 and 1799 before residing finally at Carmarthen. He supported himself by keeping school and received additional support from the proceeds of his wife's little shop, as well as from occasional gifts from well-wishers and grants from the Societas Evangelica.<br>
<br>In all, Thomas published some twenty-seven titles. The most important of them is his autobiography. Its title, <span class="italic">Rhad ras</span> (&#145;Free grace&#146;), published in 1810, echoes John Bunyan's <span class="italic">Grace Abounding</span> upon which it seems to have been modelled, inasmuch as its contents have much to say about his spiritual development. He also published elegies for the countess of Huntingdon and Howel Harris, and collections of hymns in both Welsh and English. He represented the incursion of the methods and spirituality of the evangelical revival into the older dissent, with his untiring itinerant preaching in every county in Wales and the astonishing charismatic manifestations that accompanied his preaching. John Thomas died before March 1806.<br>
