<span class="headword">Whately,  (Mary) Monica</span>  (1889&#150;1960), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights and civil liberties</span>, was born on 30 November 1889 at 16 Trebovir Road, Brompton, London, the eldest daughter of Major Reginald Pepys Whately (<i>b</i>. 1860), officer with the Royal Sussex regiment, and Maude Isabel, a singer, daughter of Thomas John Davis, Church of England clergyman. She was a great-great-niece of Archbishop Whately, and her parents converted to Catholicism in 1899. She was educated at home and at the London School of Economics, where she studied politics and world affairs. Family wealth made her financially independent, with the time and means to travel extensively throughout her life, gathering information and contacts to promote a wide range of political and humanitarian causes. She was an internationalist in the best sense of that term, and a prodigious worker for the issues she believed in, both at home and abroad.<br>
<br>Monica Whately came of age politically within the militant suffragette movement, where she developed a talent for publicity and public speaking. In 1912, with her mother, she became a founder member of the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society, and honorary treasurer and secretary of its post-1918 successor, the St Joan's Social and Political Union. However, her independent views and strong feminism were more suited to the nascent Six Point Group, an organization of mainly younger activists such as Vera Brittain and Dorothy Evans, formed in 1921. Its vigorous promotion of equal rights for women was based on a conception of equality that sought to diminish the social consequences of sexual difference. Monica represented the group on the domestic and international fronts over the next four decades. She was its delegate to the World Conference of Women Against War and Fascism in Paris in 1933, and for many years, with other members of the group, lobbied the League of Nations for an equal-rights treaty, which was finally incorporated into the United Nations charter in 1945. Between the wars she campaigned across a number of organizations and issues, and was an active member of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship until the split of 1926&#150;7, when she sided with those on the executive who unsuccessfully opposed the ascendancy of new feminism. She was particularly concerned with women's employment rights and the economic position of married women, which came under attack in the early 1930s and which underpinned the work of the Open Door Council, for which she was honorary treasurer. She organized a well-publicized picket of Austin Motors in 1933 after its chairman called for male workers to replace female as a remedy for unemployment.<br>
<br>It was chiefly Monica Whately's involvement with the Open Door Council and its outspoken resistance to protective legislation for women workers which brought her into conflict with the Labour Party leadership. Politically ambitious, she stood three times for parliament (1929, 1931, 1936), albeit as an Independent Labour Party (ILP) candidate because the national executive committee refused to endorse her. She made common cause with left-wing, mainly ILP feminists within the women's sections, including Frida Laski, Dorothy Jewson, and Dora Russell, refusing to toe the party line and working with other organizations at a time when this was frowned upon. She had more success as a local councillor, standing against Oswald Mosley and winning the London county council (LCC) ward of Limehouse in 1937. In addition to serving on the management committees of schools and hospitals, she campaigned vigorously against the marriage bar: the LCC ban on married midwives was lifted in 1940, largely through her efforts. During the Second World War she worked for the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Information, and Save the Children. In the 1940s she became involved with the Equal Pay Campaign Committee and Women for Westminster. Her experience of party politics, however, convinced her of the continuing need for autonomous feminist action, and she successfully resisted an attempt to merge the latter with the Six Point Group. She represented the group on both the National Council for Civil Liberties and the National Assembly of Women in the 1950s, and served as its chairwoman until her death.<br>
<br>International work was an important cornerstone of Monica Whately's life. Famine relief effort in the early 1920s in central and eastern Europe led to an involvement with Save the Children. Like many of her generation she was active in peace work, as a member of the Peace Army and the No More War Movement, and as a speaker for the League of Nations Union. This was coupled with a deep concern to uphold civil liberties and democracy as fascism gathered pace. She worked closely with the British Campaign Against War and Fascism, and a visit to Nazi Germany in 1934 to seek legal redress for women imprisoned without trial alerted her to the evils of the Nazi regime. Throughout the 1930s she spoke and wrote on this subject, and with Jewish and other groups organized a boycott of goods made in Germany. She made several visits to Spain during the civil war and under Franco, and also travelled beyond Europe, developing a deep interest in movements for colonial freedom. In 1931 and 1934 she visited India, met Gandhi, and was a signatory to the India League delegation report which investigated the effects of British imperialism and the causes of Indian nationalism. She journeyed to the USA and to South Africa&#151;the latter being a prelude to her involvement with the South African Committee for Colonial Freedom in the 1930s and anti-apartheid work after the war. One of her last trips was to revolutionary China, where she observed the status of women and conditions of life for working people.<br>
<br>A flamboyant figure, remembered years later for her cropped hair, black clothes, and sweeping black cloak with its red lining, Monica Whately had presence and tremendous energy. Hazel Hunkins Hallinan, who knew her in the Six Point Group, once remarked that she &#145;splashed her talents around&#146;  (Harrison interview). The cross-fertilization that came from working across many campaigns made her a lively maverick and a useful conduit of ideas, albeit one who &#145;just missed greatness&#146;  (ibid.). Her career might seem to epitomize the dissipation of energy which fragmented the inter-war women's movement. But it was precisely because she channelled her feminism into many diverse campaigns and issues that she showed its relevance to all the key movements of the twentieth century. She died on 12 September 1960 at 35 Amherst Road, London. There was no funeral, but characteristically she donated her body to the Middlesex Hospital for medical research and her eyes to Moorfield Hospital.<br>
