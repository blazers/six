<span class="headword">Blackwell,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Alun]</span>  (1797&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet and writer</span>, was born at Ponterwyl, Mold, Flintshire, the son of Peter Blackwell, collier, and his wife, Mary. He received no formal education, and at the age of eleven he was apprenticed as a shoemaker with William Kirkham. From an early age, however, he had shown the greatest avidity for books, and he carried off several prizes offered for poems and essays in the Welsh language, including an award at the eisteddfod at Mold in 1823 for an <i>awdl</i> (ode), &#145;Maes Garmon&#146;. Such activity brought him to the attention of several gentlemen and clergymen, who created a fund for his education. In January 1824 he was sent to Thomas Richards to prepare for university entrance, and in December he entered Jesus College, Oxford; he took the degree of BA in 1828. In the autumn of the latter year, at the royal Denbigh eisteddfod, a prize was awarded him for his beautiful Welsh elegy on the death of Bishop Heber. During his time at Oxford he had read everything that he could find on the history and literature of Wales in the Bodleian and the college library.<br>
<br>In 1829 Blackwell was ordained to the curacy of Holywell, Caernarvonshire. During his residence there he was a principal contributor to the columns of the <span class="italic">Gwyliedydd</span>, a periodical conducted on the principles of the established church, and in 1832 he won a prize medal at the Beaumaris eisteddfod. In 1833 he was presented by Lord Chancellor Brougham to the living of Maenordeifi in Pembrokeshire. Soon afterwards, at the request of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, he became editor of an illustrated magazine in the Welsh language, entitled <span class="italic">Y Cylchgrawn</span>, and he conducted it with remarkable ability. On 30 July 1839 he married Matilda, daughter of Jonas Dear, tidewaiter, at Holywell church. Blackwell died on 19 May 1840 at St Mary Street, Cardigan, and was buried at Maenordeifi; a tablet to his memory was placed on the wall of the church there. His poems and essays, with a memoir of his life, were edited by Griffith Edwards of Minera, in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Ceinion Alun</span> (&#145;The beauties of Alun&#146;; 1851), Alun being Blackwell's bardic name.<br>
