<span class="headword">Dowie <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Norman, FitzGerald]</span>,  M&eacute;nie Muriel</span>  (1866&#150;1945), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was born at 7 Dingle Hill, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 15 July 1866, the fourth of the five children of James Muir Dowie, corn merchant, and his wife, Annie, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5079/', "Robert Chambers (1802&#150;1871)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Vestiges of Creation</span> and founder of Chambers's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. Registered as Mary Muir Dowie and baptized Mary Muriel Dowie, she acquired the familiar name M&eacute;nie even before birth and used it all her life. About 1869 the Dowie family moved to Whetstones, West Kirkby, Deeside. Dowie was educated first at home, then&#151;from eight to eleven&#151;at a private school in Liverpool, after which she was sent abroad to complete her education first at Queen Olga's School in Stuttgart, then at the protestant seminary in Bordeaux. On her return to England the family took a house (The Golland) near Loch Leven, before moving for three years to a remote &#145;shooting&#146; in Kinross-shire where, under her father's instruction, Dowie became a proficient fisher and huntswoman. She continued her studies for a time through private tuition and St George's correspondence classes in Edinburgh, but her formal education ended at fourteen. An early ambition to be a surgeon had to be relinquished (the profession was still closed to women) and at eighteen she left home to train as an actress and dramatic reciter in London, where she made the acquaintance of Mrs Kendall. She enjoyed modest success on the stage in Scarborough in the late 1880s.<br>
<br>While still in her teens Dowie began publishing regular articles, short stories and occasional poetry in newspapers and magazines. Most were unsigned, some appeared under her initials or under pseudonyms&#151;among them, Princess Top-Storey, Judith Vermont, and M. Nugent. In spring 1890 she travelled to Austrian Poland to begin a six-month tour of the Carpathian mountains, journeying on horseback with only a peasant guide and eschewing petticoats in favour of a detachable skirt worn over knickerbockers and leggings. She ate the vegetarian diet of the peasant families with whom she stayed, smoked cigarettes, bathed in the streams, and spent her twenty-third birthday sharpening her revolver skills in case she encountered a wild bear. On her return to England she acquired immediate celebrity as a &#145;woman adventurer&#146; and the book of her adventures, <span class="italic">A Girl in the Karpathians</span>, appeared on 7 May 1891. It went through five British and four American editions within the year and for the rest of her writing career she was known to the popular press as the &#145;Girl in the Karpathians&#146;.<br>
<br>In mid-1891 Dowie was appointed London correspondent to a syndicate of newspapers in the north of England. She began to involve herself in labour politics, speaking in support of the shop assistants' <span class="roman">Weekly Half-Holiday Bill</span> and advocating rational dress and exercise for women. On 28 August she married the journalist and travel writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61020/', "Henry Norman (1858&#150;1939)")</script>. Over the next eight years they travelled extensively around Europe, Asia, and north Africa. On their return from Egypt and Sudan in 1892 Dowie toured the north of England, lecturing on their travels. A serious bout of malaria put paid to her new political involvements, but she remained a favourite with the society columnists, who were fascinated by her extravagantly stylish dress sense&#151;most memorably, a leopard- (some reports said tiger-) skin dress in which she appeared at the first-night performance of <span class="italic">Hypathia</span>. Dowie edited a collection of essays entitled <span class="italic">Women Adventurers</span> (1893), reviewed regularly until 1898 for Norman's paper, the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, and wrote its weekly column &#145;A woman's view&#146; during most of 1896.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Gallia</span>, Dowie's first novel, appeared in 1895. The &#145;sheer audacity&#146; (in one early reviewer's phrase) of its treatment of sex caused a sensation, making her one of the most prominent of the New Woman novelists. She contributed short stories to the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> and <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> in the mid-1890s, collected with other work in <span class="italic">Some Whims of Fate</span> (1896), and made the acquaintance of many of the leading figures in the English &#145;decadence&#146; movement. Dowie published two further novels, <span class="italic">The Crook of the Bough</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Love and his Mask</span> (1901).<br>
<br>In November 1896 the Normans purchased Kitcombe Farm, near Winchester. Her only child, Henry Nigel St Valery Norman, was born on 21 May 1897. Early in 1901, however, Norman discovered that his wife had been having an affair with his close friend, the mountain-climber and millionaire <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64675/', "Edward Arthur FitzGerald (1871&#150;1931)")</script>. In February 1902 Norman filed for divorce on the grounds of her adultery. A decree nisi was awarded at the start of 1903, with custody of their child awarded to him, and full details of the case were published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 30 January. Dowie was forbidden access to her son and did not see him again until he was fifteen. Her literary career appears to have ended abruptly at this point. She married FitzGerald on 13 August 1903 and spent most of the next decade abroad with him.<br>
<br>About 1918 the FitzGeralds purchased Marsden Manor, near Cirencester. There Dowie established herself as a highly successful breeder of cattle, polo ponies, and sheep. In 1929 she separated from FitzGerald. A sizeable part his fortune was lost in the Wall Street crash, and at his death in January 1931 much of the remainder was found to have been squandered or, allegedly, embezzled by a secretary. The Marsden estate was sold, and from 1931 to 1941 Dowie lived principally at Shepherd's Crown, near Winchester, though she continued to travel extensively. In 1941 she emigrated to America, partly on health grounds (she suffered badly from asthma) and partly because she believed Britain was going to lose the war. She died at Tucson, Arizona, on 25 March 1945. Her ashes were returned to England and scattered in Clifferdine Wood, near Marsden Manor.<br>
<br>Besides being one of the sources for Mrs Jardine in Rosamond Lehmann's <span class="italic">The Ballad and the Source</span>, Dowie is the model for Lil in Ethel Heddle's novel <span class="italic">Three Girls in a Flat</span> (1896) and is thought by some scholars to have influenced Hardy's portrayal of Sue Bridehead in <span class="italic">Jude the Obscure</span> (1895). Her reputation now seems secure as a leading New Woman writer of the 1890s, but her views on sexual politics were in many respects less radical than they appeared to her contemporaries. &#145;The dangerous experiment&#146; of writing in &#145;an ironic sense&#146;, she said in an interview in 1901, had caused her novels to be misinterpreted as advocating sexual revolution, when they were &#145;studies, as faithful as I could make them, of women who made rather a grotesque mess of trying to rearrange life&#146;.<br>
