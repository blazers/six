<span class="headword">Seaxburh</span> <span class="st"> [St Seaxburh, Sexburga]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 655, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>700), <span class="occ">queen of Kent, consort of King Eorcenberht, and abbess of Ely</span>, is described by Bede in his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span> as the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39123/', "Anna, king of the East Angles (d. 654?)")</script>, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39239/', "King Eorcenberht of Kent")</script>, and mother of Eorcengota (who subsequently became a saintly inmate of the Gaulish abbey of Faremoutiers-en-Brie) and also of King Hlothhere of Kent. The same writer notes that Seaxburh succeeded her sister &AElig;thelthryth as abbess of Ely and that she arranged for the translation and enshrinement of &AElig;thelthryth's undecayed body sixteen years after her death, in a white marble coffin from the ruined Roman site of Grantchester. Given Bede's proximity in time to Seaxburh's life and his knowledge of the history of Ely, his information can be accepted as reliable. More difficult to evaluate is the information provided by a series of related hagiographical texts, concerned with Kentish royal saints and St Mildrith in particular, and ranging in date from possibly as early as the eighth century to the end of the eleventh, with derivative texts from later centuries. Certain of these texts describe Seaxburh as the mother not only of Eorcengota and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39262/', "Hlothhere")</script>, but also of King Ecgberht and of Eormenhild, who is said to have been the wife of King Wulfhere of Mercia. It is not possible to corroborate this information but it is not implausible. The fullest account of Seaxburh is to be found in one of this series of texts, which is preserved in fragmentary form in London, Lambeth Palace, MS 427, fol. 211. According to this, Seaxburh and her daughter Eormenhild became nuns at Milton Regis, Kent, of which the Isle of Sheppey was a dependency. At this latter place Seaxburh built a monastery, presumably Minster in Sheppey, which took her thirty years to construct. She had been acting as regent for her son King Hlothhere, also for thirty years, and at the end of this term she is said to have bought his share of the district from him for the use of Minster in Sheppey (although it is not entirely clear what is meant by this), and to have obtained a blessing from Rome for the inmates of it. This text cannot be earlier than the viking period, since it alludes to viking attacks as prophesied by Seaxburh, and it may be as late as the eleventh century. Its information is therefore not especially trustworthy, and its character is markedly hagiographical. It was taken up by hagiographers at Ely, who seem to have drawn on it in the twelfth century to compose a Latin life of Seaxburh, in which the son on whose behalf she held the kingdom of Kent is named as Egbert (that is, Ecgberht) and not Hlothhere. Eormenhild is said to have become abbess of Ely in her turn; she is also said to have received the veil at Minster in Sheppey from Archbishop Theodore. The only firm dates which can be assigned to Seaxburh's life are 680, or possibly 679, when she succeeded &AElig;thelthryth as abbess and 695 or 696 when she translated the latter's remains. Her husband Eorcenberht was king from 640 to 664 and her marriage to him cannot have been later than <i>c</i>.650 if it is true that Ecgberht, who succeeded him, was her son. The year of her death is unknown, but as she was the eldest daughter of a father who died in 654 a date of <i>c</i>.700 is not implausible. Seaxburh became an important saint at Ely, although of lesser importance than &AElig;thelthryth. According to the twelfth-century <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, which may not be reliable on this point, her remains were translated to a new tomb at Ely by Bishop &AElig;thelwold. It is certain that they were translated into the new abbey church there in 1106. Her feast day was 6 July; the feast of her translation was 17 October.<br>
