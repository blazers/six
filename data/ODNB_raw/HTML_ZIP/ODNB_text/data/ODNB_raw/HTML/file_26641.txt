<span class="headword">Strange,  (Thomas) Lumisden</span>  (1808&#150;1884), <span class="occ">judge and theological writer</span>, was born at Landon's Gardens, Poonamallee Road, Madras, on 4 January 1808, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26640/', "Sir Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange (1756&#150;1841)")</script>, first chief justice of Madras, and his second wife, Louisa (1788&#150;1862), youngest daughter of Sir William Burroughs, bt, judge of the supreme court of Calcutta, of Castle Bagshaw, co. Cavan. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26634/', "Alexander Strange")</script> was his younger brother. Sent to England aged four, Strange (known to his family as Lumisden), was educated at Dr Pearson's school (1814?&#150;18) at East Sheen, Surrey, Westminster School (1818&#150;22), and the Revd G. K. Rusden's school at Leith Hill, near Dorking (1822&#150;4). From 1824 to 1826 he attended the East India Company's college at Haileybury, his father having procured for him a writership in the Madras civil service. He arrived in Madras in June 1827.<br>
<br>Strange's Indian career was to consist entirely of judicial work. His first substantial appointment was as assistant judge of Tellicherry, Malabar, in June 1831. In 1834, worn down by fever, he obtained eighteen months' furlough and spent it travelling in Persia and across the Caspian Sea, often in oriental disguise. Increasingly fluent in Persian, he questioned Muslims and Jews he met about their religious rituals and the seriousness with which they observed them. His account of these travels in his unpublished autobiography, &#145;The Incidents of a Life&#146;, of 1870 suggests that it was this contact with people of other religions that set him thinking about the rituals and proofs of his own faith.<br>
<br>Strange returned to his duties at Tellicherry early in 1836, but his health had not fully mended, and in March 1839 he sailed for England. On board ship he met Mary Rose 
    (Minnie; 1815&#150;1847)
  , widow of Captain William Hodgson of the Bengal artillery, whom he married at Iver, Buckinghamshire, on 1 January 1840. She was the daughter of Captain Samuel Tickell of the 8th Bengal native infantry, and a direct descendant of the poet Thomas Tickell (1685&#150;1740).<br>
<br>In 1845 Strange was appointed civil and sessions judge of Bellary. In the following year Minnie sickened, and on 4 January 1847, Strange's birthday, she died. Despairing at her loss, Strange sent their three children to England and then himself lapsed back into ill health. This time, however, he obtained relief by homoeopathic remedies, and thereafter he ran an unofficial homoeopathic dispensary for anyone who sought his assistance. In 1851 his experience in Malabar was acknowledged when he was sent to investigate the unrest among the Moplahs, Muslim cultivators and fishermen of Arab descent who periodically chafed at the financial and cultural ascendancy assumed by their Hindu landlords.<br>
<br>In 1852 Strange was appointed puisne judge of the <i>sadr diwani</i> and <i>sadr faujdari adalat</i>, whereupon he moved to Madras. There on 4 April 1856 he married Emily Burn (<i>b</i>. 1837), eldest daughter of Major-General Peter James Begbie of the Madras army; they had four children. In 1859 Strange was appointed a commissioner for inquiring into Madras's system of judicature, and in 1862 he became a judge of the new high court of Madras. In 1863 he retired and arrived back in England in May. In the course of his career he had published a short <span class="italic">Manual of Hindoo Law</span> (1856; 2nd edn, 1863), taking his father's work as a basis, and <span class="italic">A Letter to the Governor of Fort St George on Judicial Reform</span> (1860).<br>
<br>Strange's other publications were numerous. India had sparked his interest in religious subjects, and in 1852 he had published <span class="italic">The Light of Prophecy</span> and <span class="italic">Observations on Mr. Elliott's Horae Apocalypticae</span>. Subsequently he was so impressed by observing a supposed convert at the gallows proclaim his faith to be in the Hindu god Rama, and not Christ, that, on his examining Christian evidence, his own faith in Christianity broke down. He remained, however, an ardent theist. He explained his position in <span class="italic">How I Became and Ceased to be a Christian</span> and other pamphlets for the series published between 1872 and 1875 by Thomas Scott (1808&#150;1878); these were afterwards collected and issued as <span class="italic">Contributions to a Series of Controversial Writings</span> (1881). Larger works by Strange were: <span class="italic">The Bible: is it the Word of God?</span> (1871); <span class="italic">The Legends of the Old Testament Traced to their Apparent Primitive Sources</span> (1874); <span class="italic">The Sources and Development of Christianity</span> (1875); and <span class="italic">What is Christianity?</span> (1880). His <span class="italic">Development of Creation on the Earth</span> (1874) shows him to have been a keen researcher in botany and geology. He was a conscientious student and wrote in an eloquent, if not brilliant, style. He continued, after the loss of his Christian faith, to advocate good conduct and practical piety, and at the close of his autobiography&#151;written at the request of his wife Emmy&#151;he thanked a gracious God for having blessed his life.<br>
<br>Strange died at 22 Farquhar Road, Upper Norwood, Surrey, on 3 September 1884. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
