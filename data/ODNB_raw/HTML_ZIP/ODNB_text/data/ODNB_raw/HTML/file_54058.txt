<span class="headword">Groom,  Charles Ottley</span>  (1839&#150;1894), <span class="occ">impostor</span>, was born on 14 May 1839 at Merchiston, Tobago, the posthumous son of Charles Edward Groom (1815&#150;1838), sugar planter, and his wife, Ann (1815&#150;1895), daughter of Archibald Napier. His childhood was mainly spent in Sussex with a highly protective mother, with whom he lived until his death. He was a sickly child with precocious interests in natural history, science, and antiquarianism: &#145;My intellectual activity and vivid imagination was doubtless the cause of my delicacy. My mind was full of gigantic schemes, which were little influenced by my capacity for their execution&#146;  (Napier, <span class="italic">Tommy Try</span>, 57). His earliest works were ornithological. In 1873 his testimony to a House of Commons select committee assisted the enactment of the <span class="roman">Wild Birds Protection Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Among Groom's publications, <span class="italic">Tommy Try, or, What he did in Science</span> (1869) is a charming if arch memoir of his boyhood. In <span class="italic">The Book of Nature and the Book of Man</span> (1870) Groom vividly argued that humankind represented the microcosm of creation which all lower forms of life imitated. Its preface (ascribed to the dead Lord Brougham and Vaux) boasted that &#145;the author has strode the gulf between Physics and Metaphysics, Mind and Matter, Instinct and Reason, God and Man&#146;. Groom in 1875 read a paper before the British Association promoting his vegetarian cure for alcoholism, and issued several vegetarian tracts. His book <span class="italic">Lakes and Rivers</span> (1879) was published under the auspices of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. In his <span class="italic">Prospectus</span> (1886), issued to attract subscribers for a complete edition of his works, Groom published testimonials to the greatness of his <span class="italic">Book of Nature</span> from celebrities who were no longer living and who could not repudiate the grotesqueries foisted on them: he claimed that Victor Hugo attributed his deathbed Christian conversion to Groom's treatise and that he confessed, &#145;I never wished so much to steal a book as this&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prospectus</span>, v).<br>
<br>Groom's chief impostures were genealogical. They began with his change of surname to Napier (1865), although until the late 1870s he was usually known as C. O. Groom Napier (of Merchiston). He then adopted the title of prince of Mantua and Montferrat, and elaborated a pedigree tracing his descent from many great historical figures, most notably King David of Israel. It was on this basis that he described himself as prince of the house of David, in which title he claimed to have been certified by Sir George Jessel. He and his mother assumed the princely surname of Gonzaga. The prince also bore subsidiary titles, including prince of Ferrera, Nevers, Rethel, and Alen&ccedil;on; Baron de Tobago; and master of Lennox, Kilmahew, and Merchiston. On 24 March 1879 he held a banquet for 7000 guests in a specially constructed pavilion at Greenwich, the walls of which were hung with 700 illuminated leaves of vellum illustrating his pedigree. He was too unwell to attend the festivities, which were conducted on strict vegetarian and teetotal principles, with outlandish salads and sucking pigs modelled in piecrust and containing fruit and vegetable jellies. A beverage of his devising, curry champagne, concocted from curry powder and ginger beer, was served. The dipsomaniacs whom he had rescued by his vegetarian cure wore on their backs pieces of yellow silk embroidered with broken bottles.<br>
<br>In 1882 the prince announced the Mantua and Montferrat Medal Fund, founded by a fourteenth-century Gonzaga ancestor to confer recognition upon eminent artists and scientists. His family, so he pretended, had awarded gold medals to Raphael, Michelangelo, Dante, Galileo, Columbus, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Erasmus, Milton, Moli&egrave;re, and Rubens; Shakespeare was so grateful for the award in 1614 that he intended to write a play about the family. Mantua medals were issued widely: if Froude, Gladstone, Huxley, and Shaftesbury were suspicious, Ruskin, Tennyson, Manning, and Leighton seem to have been duped. One recipient was Sir Richard Owen, whose medal is in the British Museum; Groom was later &#145;warned off the BM&#146;  (Sherborn, 61). In 1883 he announced that an eighteenth-century duke of Mantua and Montferrat had left money for educational purposes which, by accumulation, amounted to &pound;750,000. A great meeting was held at Exeter Hall (15 June) to allot this sum for the establishment of a Welsh university. The prince read a long, rambling speech together with much implausible family correspondence, including a letter from Dante (July 1317) to his ancestor: &#145;Your medal cheers me from a melancholy deep as hell itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 June 1883). This fiasco exploded most of his pretensions. He also issued in 1883 a vague but grandiloquent listing of the contents of his private museum, including natural history specimens, ancestral portraits by great masters, antiquities, and relics&#151;almost all probably bogus.<br>
<br>The prince having become a director of the City of Genoa Waterworks Company (registered 1886), some bondholders sued him on grounds of misrepresentations in the prospectus. He settled with them in 1888, but one creditor petitioned for his bankruptcy over a debt of &pound;1016 (December 1889). He obtained his discharge from bankruptcy in March 1890.<br>
<br>The prince's manners were courtly, benevolent, and melancholic. He was characterized as &#145;a notorious rogue and thief&#146;, who &#145;sold false nuggets to Ruskin&#146; and tried to kill the mineralogist Thomas Davies by dropping a boulder on him from a high ladder in the Strand  (Sherborn, 62&#150;3). He died of long-standing cardiac disease on 17 January 1894 at 18 Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale, his death being registered as that of Charles de Bourbon d'Este Paleologues Gonzaga, prince of Mantua and Montferrat. His mother (who was dying of stomach cancer) arranged for the posthumous publication of <span class="italic">Visions of the Interior of the Earth, and of Past, Present and Future Events</span> (1894), an account of his trances under the charge of the Archangel Gabriel, patron saint of the house of Gonzaga.<br>
