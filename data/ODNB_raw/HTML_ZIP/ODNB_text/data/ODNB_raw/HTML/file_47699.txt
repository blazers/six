<span class="headword">Watts,  Charles</span>  (1836&#150;1906), <span class="occ">secularist and journalist</span>, was born in Bristol on 27 February 1836, the son of George Watts, a bootmaker. His parents were strict Wesleyan Methodists, his father being a local preacher. Having made his lecturing d&eacute;but on the temperance platform when he was fourteen, Watts was converted to freethought by the lectures of G. J. Holyoake. At the age of sixteen he left home for London, where he associated with the freethinkers in south London. He was joined by his older brother John (1834&#150;1866), a printer who worked for the Holyoake brothers at 147 Fleet Street and then set up his own business in 1858. When John became editor of Charles Bradlaugh's <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> in 1864, Charles was appointed sub-editor. At the same time he became a full-time lecturer in the secularist movement, and in 1866 was made first secretary of the National Secular Society, a post he held until 1871 and again from 1873 to 1875.<br>
<br>When Austin Holyoake died in 1874, his printing and publishing business at 17 Johnson's Court was purchased by the freethought movement from the widow and presented to Watts. He was at this date second only to Bradlaugh in the secularist movement, but in 1877 the two quarrelled bitterly over Watts's refusal to defend an action brought against him as nominal publisher of Charles Knowlton's birth-control work <span class="italic">The Fruits of Philosophy</span>. He resigned from the National Secular Society and, with other secularists opposed to Bradlaugh, founded the British Secular Union as a short-lived rival to the National Secular Society, and acquired G. J. Holyoake's weekly periodical the <span class="italic">Secular Review</span> as its organ. He edited this until 1882, when he made the first of three visits to North America, leaving his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53999/', "Charles Albert Watts (1858&#150;1946)")</script> in charge of his printing and publishing business, and W. S. Ross as editor of the <span class="italic">Secular Review</span>. On his third visit, in 1884, he settled in Toronto, where in 1887 he published a weekly periodical, <span class="italic">Secular Thought</span>. Having resettled in England after Bradlaugh's death in 1891, he resumed lecturing for the National Secular Society until 1902, when he again resigned following accusations by G. W. Foote that he had diverted donations from the National Secular Society to the Rationalist Press Association, which had been founded by his son Charles Albert in 1899. He devoted the rest of his life to supporting this latter organization.<br>
<br>Charles Watts was an amiable man, and a popular lecturer and debater. Through the misfortune of falling foul of both Charles Bradlaugh and G. W. Foote his contribution to the National Secular Society and radical freethought in over forty years of public life has been underestimated. He published nearly fifty books and pamphlets on controversial political and religious topics, some of which were gathered together in <span class="italic">The Meaning of Rationalism and other Essays</span> (1905), but his writings lacked style and originality and are now seldom read. All his entries in the <span class="italic">British Library Catalogue of Printed Books</span> are mistakenly attributed to his son Charles Albert Watts.<br>
<br>Watts was married twice. His first wife, Mary Ann Tomkins, whom he had married on 12 June 1856, died of consumption in 1870, aged thirty-three. His children by this first marriage were Clara Agnes (1857&#150;1921), Charles Albert, Frank (1862/3&#150;1913), William (1863/4&#150;1872), Annie (1866/7&#150;1913), and Wallace George (1867/8&#150;1870). His second marriage (on 19 November 1870) was to Eunice Kate Nowlan (1847/8&#150;1924), the daughter of William Nowlan, a bootmaker and fellow freethinker; he had met her while staying at her father's house in Nottingham on a provincial lecture tour. She was an active secularist who also acted on the London stage under the name of Kate Carlyon. They had one daughter, Kate Eunice, born on 20 May 1875. Watts died on 16 February 1906 at 13 Carminia Road, Balham, and was cremated at Golders Green on 21 February; his ashes were buried in Highgate cemetery the following day.<br>
