<span class="headword">Johnson,  Tom</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Thomas Jackling]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1797), <span class="occ">prize-fighter</span>, was born Thomas Jackling in Derby. He was known as Tom Johnson throughout his professional life. He was working in London as a corn porter in 1781 when he took on his first professional fight, beating the once great veteran Stephen Oliver, who rejoiced in the nickname of Death. The fight linked two great eras of boxing as Oliver had appeared in the old amphitheatres of Figg, Taylor, and Broughton in its first age and Johnson was to become the first champion of the next, though before then he had several minor bouts, all for stakes of 50 guineas at most.<br>
<br>In 1786 the prince of Wales and his two brothers, the dukes of Kent and Clarence, began to take an active interest and pugilism became the fashion. Johnson was clearly the best boxer of the day and in January 1787 he met Will Ward for a fight for 200 guineas a side before a large crowd at Oakingham, Berkshire. The vogue proved strong enough to survive a disappointing fight which Johnson won easily, but he himself failed to appreciate the change in his sport's fortunes, and took on the ponderous slogger Fry for a mere 50 guineas in the following summer when most of the new gentry enthusiasts were out of town and little interest was aroused. This was the last of his old-style skirmishes. The stake money that he attracted grew impressively, from 300 guineas for the two fights with the Irish challenger Michael Ryan, to 500 for the fights against Isaac Perrins and Ben Bryan. By the time of the Perrins fight Johnson was beginning to show his age and won only after a hard struggle over sixty-two rounds. This contest in particular brought him riches such as he had never known before. His backer, Thomas Bullock, a well-known sportsman, won &pound;20,000 on the fight and made his fighter (who also took two-thirds of the gate money) a present of &pound;1000.<br>
<br>As a boxer Johnson was one of the earliest to make justifiable claims to be &#145;scientific&#146; in that he would cautiously assess the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent and concentrate attacks on his most vulnerable areas, a discretion and care which did not, however, extend to his life outside the ring. He was said to have had property worth &pound;5000 by the late 1780s but money slipped rapidly through his fingers. He found himself forced to defend his championship against Ben Bryan in January 1791 when he was over forty and unfit. He injured his hand on a ring railing, lost his usual composure, and was defeated. Thereafter his decline was both sad and rapid. It was said of him that while working as a porter in his younger days he once took the place of a sick colleague by carrying twice a normal load, covering for the absentee so that his wages would continue to be paid and his wife and children sustained. Unfortunately there was little sign of such generosity of heart in his post-ring life.<br>
<br>Johnson took over The Grapes, Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and soon turned it into what was little short of a gambling den and resort of criminals. He gave reluctant and shifting evidence at Chelmsford assizes at the trial of John Wiltshire, accused of robbing two travellers from Newmarket. Johnson was then reduced to taking his gambling table to fights and making a nuisance of himself at the cockpit, refusing to pay up on losing bets and offering to fight instead. He moved to Ireland, first to Dublin then to Cork, found attempts to profit from his pugilism unrewarding, and again took to his gambling table. His deterioration was rapid. Both his health and his spirit were broken and he died there on 21 January 1797.<br>
