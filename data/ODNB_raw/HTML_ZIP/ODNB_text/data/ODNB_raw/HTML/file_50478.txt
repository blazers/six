<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simon,  Andr&eacute; Louis</span>  (1877&#150;1970), <span class="occ">writer on wine and food</span>, was born on 28 February 1877 in rue Taranne, in the sixth <i>arrondissement</i> of Paris, the second son and second child in the family of six sons and one daughter of Ernest Constant Simon (<i>c</i>.1848&#150;1895), artist and former <i>zouave pontifical</i>, and his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Emile Dardoize, artist. He was educated at Le Petit S&eacute;minaire, Notre Dame des Champs, in Paris, and after failing his <i>baccalaur&eacute;at</i> he worked for a few months in 1894 for <span class="italic">L'Avant Garde, gazette bi-mensuelle des Zouaves Pontificaux</span>, a royalist journal. He then worked in England, improving his English, before three years' military service at the &Eacute;cole Militaire in Paris, on the staff of the <span class="italic">Revue d'Artillerie</span>. On 17 October 1900 he married Edith Winifred (1879&#150;1963), daughter of Henry Bond Symons, a former railway engineer, of Southampton, whom he had met in England. They had two sons and three daughters; one son became a Jesuit priest, and two of their daughters became nuns.<br>
<br>In 1899 Simon began an apprenticeship with the champagne house Pommery and Greno, in Rheims, and was sent to London in 1902 to Pommery's London agent, to work as a champagne shipper. At the outbreak of the First World War, Simon reported to his regiment, the 13th artillery regiment, at Vincennes, Paris, and spent most of the war as an interpreter, including two years with the 50th (Northumbrian) division. He was awarded the British Military Medal in 1916.<br>
<br>In 1905 Simon published the first of more than 100 books and pamphlets, <span class="italic">The History of the Champagne Trade in England</span>, a scholarly work based on records in the Guildhall Library, followed by his <span class="italic">History of the Wine Trade in England</span> (1906&#150;9) in three volumes. He was one of the founders of the Wine Trade Club in 1908, and as chairman of the education committee he gave regular lectures about wine, many of which were later published, and built up a wine library, while at the same time forming his own private collection. <span class="italic">The Art of Good Living</span> (1929), a guide to the wines appropriate to different dishes, his first book about food, was followed by an exhibition at the First Edition Club of early printed books and manuscripts from his collection, including a leaf from the Gutenberg <span class="roman">Bible</span> with Isaiah's prophecy of the vine. He travelled to South Africa, and was active in La Ligue Internationale des Adversaires des Prohibitions, which was wound up in 1933 after the American Congress repealed the <span class="roman">Prohibition Act</span>. In 1931 Simon was one of the founders of the Saintsbury Club, a dining club formed in honour of George Saintsbury (1845&#150;1933), the literary critic and author of <span class="italic">Notes on a Cellar Book</span> (1920).<br>
<br>In 1932 Simon found himself without a job when Pommery appointed a new agent for the sale of the firm's champagne. He became managing director of the Madeira Wine Association Ltd, formed to popularize madeira in England after he had visited Madeira in 1933, but this was short-lived. He was also asked by Constable to edit <span class="italic">Constable's Wine Library</span>, a new series of popular books on wine. He wrote <span class="italic">Madeira: Wine, Cakes, and Sauce</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Port</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Champagne</span> (1934) himself, and commissioned friends to write the others.<br>
<br>It was through Ye Sette of Odd Volumes, a literary dining club, that he met A. J. A. Symons (1900&#150;1941), founder of the First Edition Club, and in October 1933 they started the Wine and Food Society, a private venture. Symons became secretary, and Simon organized the lunches, dinners, and wine tastings, and edited the quarterly journal <span class="italic">Wine and Food</span>. 212 attended the first meal, an Alsatian luncheon at the Caf&eacute; Royal, and by the end of the first year there were more than 1000 members. The society's first birthday was celebrated with a banquet at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, marking the centenary of the death of Antonin Car&ecirc;me, chef to the prince regent. Simon visited the United States for the first time in 1934, founding several branches of the society.<br>
<br>The Second World War put an end to the society's dinners, and after the death of A. J. A. Symons in 1941 Simon carried on alone, continuing to bring out <span class="italic">Wine and Food</span>, with editorials dismissing the idea that wartime food had to be dull. The whole of the winter 1941 issue was devoted to the sausage, and Ernest Oldmeadow, an expert on frugal cookery, contributed a series of recipes. Simon published cookery pamphlets, including <span class="italic">Soups, Salads, Souses: Wartime Fare for the Fastidious</span> (1944), and also completed his <span class="italic">Concise Encyclopedia of Gastronomy</span> (1939&#150;46). After the war the dinners and wine tastings resumed. Simon travelled all over the world, visiting the many branches of the society: in 1954, its twenty-first birthday, there were twenty branches in England, twenty in the United States, and twelve elsewhere. In his late eighties Simon toured Australia and published <span class="italic">The Wines, Vineyards, and Vignerons of Australia</span> (1967). He withdrew from the management of the Wine and Food Society in 1967, when he was ninety.<br>
<br>Andr&eacute; Simon was regarded as the leading authority in the world on wine and gastronomy, although he himself never learned to cook. His philosophy of life is best expressed in <span class="italic">Tables of Content</span> (1933), a record of special occasions over the previous five years: here he says that the greatest joy is good wine in good company, and refers to a birthday dinner in 1914, &#145;What a dinner it was! What anecdotes, reminiscences, jokes and arguments flowed good-humouredly with every one of those perfect wines!&#146;  (xviii). He remained a French citizen, and retained a strong French accent. From 1919 he was president of the French Benevolent Society, founded in 1842 to care for destitute French immigrants in London. He published <span class="italic">Les pauvres de France en Angleterre</span> in 1924, with illustrations by well-known artists. But he also loved England: he had his own cricket field in the grounds of his Sussex house, and he believed that English food was as good as the best anywhere, especially when partnered with French wines. Jovial, enthusiastic, and good-natured, Simon had thick snowy white hair and a portly figure. In 1968 he claimed never to have had a day's illness, and he continued his lifelong habit of opening a bottle of champagne at eleven every morning. He published two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">By Request</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">In the Twilight</span> (1969).<br>
<br>Simon was made an honorary CBE in 1964 and an honorary freeman of the Vintners' Company in 1968. He died on 5 September 1970 in the Middlesex Hospital, London. A memorial requiem mass was held in Westminster Cathedral on 19 October 1970.<br>
