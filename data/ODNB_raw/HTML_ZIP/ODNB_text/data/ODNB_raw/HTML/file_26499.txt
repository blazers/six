<span class="headword">Stewart,  Murdoch <span class="st"> [Murdac]</span></span>, second duke of Albany  (<em>c.</em>1362&#150;1425), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26502/', "Robert Stewart, first duke of Albany (d. 1420)")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II (1316&#150;1390)")</script>, and only son of Albany's first marriage, to Margaret Graham, countess of Menteith (<i>d</i>. in or before 1380). He was made justiciar north of Forth in 1389 in succession to his uncle Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan and lord of Badenoch, as part of his father's attack on that magnate. In 1391 or 1392 Murdoch married Isabella Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1458/9), eldest daughter and coheir of Duncan, eighth earl of Lennox. The terms of their marriage included the entailing of the Lennox on Murdoch and his heirs. As the heir to three earldoms, those of Fife and Menteith, which his father held, as well as that of Lennox, Murdoch had glittering prospects. In 1402, however, his situation altered drastically. Leading a force drawn from Albany's following in central Scotland to support the army led by the fourth earl of Douglas, he was captured at Homildon.<br>
<br>Stewart was handed over to Henry IV by the earl of Northumberland and remained a prisoner for the next thirteen years. He was largely detained in the Tower of London, in company for part of the time with his captive king, James I, and he sealed letters sent to Scotland by James in 1412. However, while James was left in prison until 1424, Stewart's release was negotiated in exchange for the return of the exile Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland, in 1415. The disparity of their treatment may have rankled with James, and certainly suggests that the priority of the duke of Albany, the governor of Scotland in the king's absence, was the release of his heir. From the English point of view, Henry V's motive was probably to ensure the stability of his northern borders, at a time of renewed war with France. The absence of Murdoch had caused Albany to worry about the future of his family's position. The duke was in his sixties, and promoted first his younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26483/', "John Stewart, earl of Buchan")</script>, and then, as they reached adulthood, Murdoch's sons as potential successors. Murdoch's eldest son, Robert, appeared as a regular councillor of the governor from 1407, while his younger brother Walter was associated with their other grandfather, Duncan, earl of Lennox, also an old man. These moves protected the rights of Murdoch and his family in his lands, but also had the effect of creating expectations of regional power in his sons. Robert was referred to as Robert Stewart of Fife and Walter held the title of Lennox. Both must have built up significant influence in Albany's following, which their father, absent since 1402, would be unable to match. Although Robert of Fife died before Albany, in 1419, Walter's personal connections within the Lennox were to be a serious problem for Murdoch's authority when he became governor.<br>
<br>Murdoch succeeded to his father's lands on the first duke's death in September 1420. By late October he had also succeeded to the office of governor of Scotland. His reputation as governor has always been low, contrasting with the praise heaped on his father. The view of both men derives from the contemporary opinion of Walter Bower, who described Murdoch as &#145;too slack in the exercise of this office&#146; and unable to control his &#145;arrogant&#146; sons  (Bower, 8.135). Bower's view ignores Murdoch's success in maintaining Scottish interests abroad and in keeping the support of a number of significant magnates, most importantly Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar, the lieutenant of the governors in the north, with whom Murdoch concluded an indenture in late 1420. Despite these achievements, though, Bower's verdict reflects Murdoch's inability to maintain the Albany regime, a failure due to two factors.<br>
<br>First, Murdoch could not hold together the affinity which the first duke had created in central Scotland. The personal standing of his father, a major figure in Scottish politics since the 1360s, was impossible to recreate, and Murdoch was hampered further by the challenge to his authority mounted by his son Walter. The initial dispute between the two revolved around the succession to Murdoch's estates. Walter seems to have been intended as heir to Duncan, earl of Lennox, but following the death of his elder brother, Robert, he now stood to inherit his father's lands as well. An attempt by Murdoch to make Walter abandon his claims to the Lennox to his younger brother Alexander led to open conflict between the governor and his heir. Walter won the support of Earl Duncan and of numerous other members of the Albany affinity, which severely weakened Murdoch's power and led to later stories about his failure to control his own sons.<br>
<br>The second factor was the dissent that stemmed from the fourth earl of Douglas. Douglas had probably only ever tolerated the Albany governorship in return for a free hand in Scotland south of Forth. In such a scenario Douglas's adoption of grander titles for himself and his search for international status would have symbolized his limited acceptance of Albany Stewart authority. More worrying were Douglas's approaches to England concerning the return of James I. The death of Henry V in 1422 made the English ready to free their captive on the right terms. Although Murdoch may have delayed negotiations on the issue throughout early 1423, support for James's release, even from Murdoch's own councillors, forced the governor to enter talks in August. While this satisfied Douglas, it alienated Walter, whose ambitions of inheriting the governorship were dashed. Walter was clearly on the brink of open rebellion, seeking French military intervention, before a settlement was reached with his father. Murdoch had meanwhile been preparing his own future by consolidating his ties with Mar and with his brother Buchan, the leader of the Scots in French service. Appreciating the problems ahead, the duke was making sensible plans to stave off royal hostility.<br>
<br>In the first months of James I's reign Murdoch appeared to have achieved his goal. James's arrest of Walter was in Murdoch's interest as much as the king's. The favour shown to Murdoch's third and favourite son, Alexander, suggests the duke had survived the transition of power safely. Even his withdrawal from the council from June 1424 may have been part of a deliberate maintenance of a low profile. The death of Buchan and the destruction of his army at Verneuil in 1424 changed this. Murdoch had lost the insurance of a returning Scottish army. The king reacted by taking control of Buchan's lands and arresting Duncan of Lennox and other supporters of Walter. By the end of 1424 James had begun to interfere in Murdoch's lands. Criticism of the king in parliament in March 1425 may have been promoted by Murdoch in response. Perhaps he hoped to win backing from the estates, but James had eroded his support beyond repair. On 21 March Murdoch, his wife, Isabella, and his son Alexander were arrested and his principal castles of Doune and Falkland were seized. The escape of Murdoch's youngest son, James the Fat, to the Lennox to lead a local rebellion merely provided the king with the justification to execute all the male leaders of the Albany family. Murdoch was tried on 25 May by James I and an assize of great magnates, indicating the extent to which royal aggression and promises had isolated him. Even his ally Mar joined in passing the sentence. The following day he was executed, traditionally on the Heading Hill to the north of Stirling Castle. Along with his sons Walter and Alexander, he was buried in the Dominican friary in Stirling.<br>
<br>Without his father's status and challenged by his own family, Murdoch found it impossible to prolong the Albany regime in the face of English readiness to release the adult James I. Sensible attempts to ensure his family's survival suggest he was no fool, but rather a man facing too many pressures on his position to survive.<br>
