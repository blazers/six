<span class="headword">Weld,  Jane Charlotte</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Baroness Weld]</span>  (1806&#150;1871), <span class="occ">convert to Roman Catholicism and benefactor</span>, was born at Purley, near Windsor, Berkshire, and baptized on 10 August 1806 at Sunninghill. She was the eldest of the six children born to Edward Lesmoir Gordon (<i>c</i>.1763&#150;1832) and his wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1873), daughter of Joseph Halliday of Bath. Her father, a scion of the protestant family of Lesmoir of Aberdeen, possessed independent means and was a member of the royal household at Windsor. Between 1815 and 1822 he deserted his wife and six children, fleeing to France to avoid his creditors. The difficulties and deprivations of those years left their mark on his daughter, who was educated by her mother until the age of sixteen when, for reasons which are obscure, she was sent to a Roman Catholic convent in Ghent.<br>
<br>On 25 August 1825, while still a minor, Jane Gordon married Samuel Weld (<i>c</i>.1793&#150;1851), the eldest son of William Weld (1762&#150;1837) of Weld House, Kensington, and Heath House, Twickenham, a descendant of the Welds of Rushton, Flintshire. He was a solicitor with Capron and Weld, the leading Roman Catholic law firm in London. They had a daughter, Caroline Jane, born in 1826, who died in infancy, and a son, Gordon Samuel (1829&#150;1863).<br>
<br>On 14 May 1836, eleven years after her marriage, Jane Weld was received into the Roman Catholic church. Neither at the time of her marriage nor during the next decade does she seem to have been under pressure to embrace the family's faith, though she was said to have had a long-standing interest in Roman Catholicism. During 1835 and 1836 she had attended Nicholas Wiseman's lectures at the Sardinian chapel, and she corresponded with him immediately before her reception. In 1843, while visiting Florence, Samuel Weld was granted a barony by the grand duke of Tuscany &#145;for rendering him some service&#146;. She became known as Baroness Weld, a title she used for the rest of her life. The following year Samuel retired from his legal practice and the family then lived abroad mainly in Paris, where other members of the Weld family were living, and in Rome, where there was a community of wealthy English Catholics. Samuel died in 1851 at 6 place de Sorbonne, Paris. Jane had his body returned to England, where he was buried in St George's Roman Catholic Cathedral, London.<br>
<br>On 10 August 1853 Jane Weld married John Frederic Winterbottom (1800&#150;1868), a barrister of Lincoln's Inn and close friend of her late husband. Resident at Tile Barn, East Woodhay, Hampshire, her second husband was a committed member of the Church of England involved in charitable activities, and the possessor of a fine collection of paintings. Wiseman, the catalyst for her conversion, meanwhile became a personal friend, and after her second marriage he was a frequent visitor at her London home, 75 Victoria Street, Westminster. Endeavouring to meet the religious demands that Wiseman placed upon his followers, she gave money, time, and energy to the enterprises that fulfilled his wishes and expectations. After Wiseman's death it was those of his successor, Henry Edward Manning, she sought to fulfil. In 1865 she was a member of the original group of financial supporters of the Roman Catholic cathedral to be built in Westminster, consecrated to Wiseman's memory, who were later known as &#145;the pioneers of the cathedral&#146;. She gave &pound;11,000, some of which was for a chapel in memory of her son. When the cathedral was built this sum, having greatly increased by investment, paid for the richly ornate and decorated lady chapel.<br>
<br>The determining factors underlying Weld's charitable activities were her first-hand knowledge of the plight of the poor gained from her experiences as a member of the Catholic Women's Association for the Visiting of Hospitals in London and her compliance with Wiseman's belief that the church's most effective mission to the sick and the poor was achieved by the work of members of religious communities. She became a founder member and lifelong supporter of the St Elizabeth and St John Hospital, Great Ormond Street, provided financial assistance to the work of St George's Hospital and Paddington Lying-in Hospital, and provided the funds to establish a convent house for the Sisters of Mercy in Hanwell, later providing the &pound;2000 required for the building of a convalescent home for poor women attached to it. Through donations and legacies she aided the work of the Sisters of St Vincent de Paul, the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Dominican Sisters of Mercy and Charity, the Aged Poor Society, the Westminster Fund for Poor Children, the Providence Row Night Refuge, and the Young Men's Catholic Society.<br>
<br>Church building was another object of Weld's benefactions. A. W. N. Pugin, a fellow convert, was her preferred architect and after his death his son Edward Pugin received her approval. The building of the new church of St Aloysius in Oxford was made possible by her legacy of &pound;7000. She also left &pound;2000 for a church to replace the mission of St Joseph, Newbury, and &pound;5000 for one to be built in Twickenham. She paid for a chapel to be built in St George's Cathedral, Southwark, in memory of her first husband. The mortuary chapel for her second husband was built in the churchyard of St Thomas's Church, Woolton Hill, East Woodhay. The Roman Catholic cemetery at Kensal Green, London, was the chosen site for the chapel built for her son and herself.<br>
<br>In poor health, Weld left England in September 1871 and died at 42 rue &Eacute;glise, Ostend, Belgium, on 24 November 1871. She had inherited substantial property from her first and second husbands (both of whom had approved and supported her charitable activities), and from her son, who predeceased her. She left the bulk of this property (about &pound;48,000) to religious and charitable purposes connected with the Catholic church. Her will, dated 14 May 1866, and ten codicils were challenged by her mother and unmarried sister who, along with her other surviving siblings, were provided only with small annuities. In a case heard in the court of probate in July 1873 they contended that it was the product of the &#145;undue influence&#146; asserted on her by members of the Catholic hierarchy. Their counsel played on the role of her successive Jesuit confessors, Peter Gallwey and Albany Christie. Other evidence, however, indicated that the will was consistent with her long-held religious beliefs and that, as the judge emphasized in his directions to the jury, &#145;she was not only of sound mind, but &hellip; was of unusually business-like habits&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 July 1873). The jury's immediate decision to uphold the validity of the will was applauded in a leading article  (ibid., 12 July 1873) as a vindication of the right of testamentary disposition, thereby protecting the wishes of individuals who sought to use their property to promote public objectives.<br>
<br>An intelligent, sensible woman of great energy, a lively conversationalist and a good companion, Jane Weld numbered among her associates such socially prominent Catholic women as the duchess of Norfolk, Baroness Petre, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, and Lady Herbert of Lea. Her achievements were prompted by a willingness to fulfil the wishes of the clergy who exercised persuasive leadership over the community of wealthy Victorian Catholics to which she belonged.<br>
