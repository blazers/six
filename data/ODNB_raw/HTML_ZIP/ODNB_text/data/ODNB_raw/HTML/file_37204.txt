<span class="headword">Boghurst,  William</span>  (1630/31&#150;1685), <span class="occ">apothecary</span>, of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, was the son of William Boghurst of Ditton, Kent, and served his apprenticeship with a London apothecary, Francis Drury. During the great plague of 1665 his medical practice expanded and he made his name. He stayed in the city throughout the epidemic, treating by his own account &#145;40, 50 or 60 patients a day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Intelligencer</span>, 7 Aug 1665) and advertising his medicines and services in <span class="italic">The Intelligencer</span>. By the end of the year his reputation was sufficient to attract offers from the corporation of Norwich, which tried to employ him when the infection reached there.<br>
<br>Boghurst described the symptoms of the disease, and remedies for it, in &#145;Loimographia, or, An experimentall relation of the plague&#146; (1666, BL, Sloane MS 349). This manuscript, which was clearly intended for publication, reflects his personal observation as well as drawing on the published literature (in Latin as well as English) on the disease. Boghurst was critical of the established practice of quarantining infected households&#151;a policy &#145;oft enough tried and always found ineffectual&#146;&#151;and was in general doubtful about the conclusions drawn from theories of contagion. He also criticized the standard treatments of bleeding and purging and the practice of fumigating houses, though he sensibly warned against using the linen and bedding of sick patients. He described the symptoms of the disease with great accuracy, and correctly predicted its gradual decline in 1666, since &#145;the plague hath a long tail, &hellip; going backwards and forwards in little increases and decreases till it be quite gone&#146;. His work is both a testimony to the critical acumen of a seventeenth-century general practitioner and the most reliable eyewitness account of bubonic plague in 1665.<br>
<br>Boghurst also wrote a poem in praise of London, &#145;Londinologia, sive, Londini encomium&#146; (1666, BL, Sloane MS 904, fols. 53&#150;68), estimating its population at one million (double the actual figure), celebrating the antiquity of St Paul's (on the eve of its destruction in the great fire), and welcoming the growth of the West End over the past forty years:<blockquote>
<div>so large, so beautiful, so fair and strait<br>
</div>
<div>both streets and houses uniform and neat.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Little is known about Boghurst's family or personal circumstances. According to an epitaph, &#145;he was an honest, just man, skilful in his profession, and in the Greek and Latin tongue, delighting in the study of antiquity; and played exceeding well upon the lute, which he took naturally. He left a sorrowful widow and six children, to whom he afforded commendable breeding&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 904, fol. 68<i>r</i>). In later life, however, his fortunes appear to have declined: he could not afford the livery of his company in 1682. He died in London on 2 September 1685 and was buried in Ditton.<br>
