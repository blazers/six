<span class="headword">Tennant,  Smithson</span>  (1761&#150;1815), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 30 November 1761 at Selby, Yorkshire and baptized there in the abbey church on 3 December. He was the only child of the Revd Calvert Tennant, absentee rector of Great Warley in Essex and fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and his wife, Mary, daughter of William Daunt, a Selby surgeon-apothecary. Tennant's father died in 1772 and his mother in 1781, leaving him with sufficient inheritance to live his life as he wished. After passing through grammar schools at Scorton, Tadcaster, and Beverley, Tennant attended the chemistry lectures of Joseph Black at the University of Edinburgh in 1781. In October 1782 he entered Christ's College, Cambridge, to study chemistry and botany, first as pensioner and later as fellow-commoner.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1784 Tennant travelled to Denmark and Sweden, where he met the chemist Karl Scheele, and two years later he toured France and the Low Countries. On 13 January 1785, with the support of his Cambridge colleagues, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and in 1786 he transferred with his friend Busick Harwood to Emmanuel College. During this period Tennant was befriended by William Hyde Wollaston, a medical student at Gonville and Caius College, who was to become his business associate in 1800.<br>
<br>Shortly after receiving his MB degree in 1788, Tennant took up residence at 4 Garden Court, Temple, in London and indulged his interests in natural philosophy. His first scientific paper, on the decomposition of fixed air, which confirmed by analysis the presence of carbon in the gas, was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1791. In 1792&#150;3 he toured the continent again, and on his return to England attended the London hospitals prior to taking his Cambridge MD degree in 1796. With no interest in pursuing a medical practice, Tennant settled instead into a career as a gentleman chemist. He published an important paper in 1797 which demonstrated that diamond has the same chemical composition as charcoal. About this time he purchased 500 acres of newly enclosed land near Shipham in Somerset, where he carried out experiments in agricultural chemistry during the few months each year he resided there.<br>
<br>In 1800 Tennant entered into a business partnership with Wollaston, who had then recently abandoned his London medical practice to establish a chemical business. The two men agreed to share expenses and profits from the purification of alluvial platinum ore and the manufacture of various organic substances important to the textile industry. Owing principally to Wollaston's discovery of a method for the production of malleable platinum, and profitable sales of the pure metal, the business flourished and Tennant's accumulated profit at the time of his death was about &pound;3000. From the residues of the platinum purification process, Tennant isolated and characterized the two new metals osmium and iridium. Publication of these discoveries, which established Tennant's fame as a chemist, earned for him the Royal Society's Copley medal for 1804. Thereafter Tennant's contribution to the business became almost negligible as he became more interested in political economy and discourse with the Whig political figures connected with John Whishaw and Holland House.<br>
<br>In 1812 Tennant gave a short series of informal lectures on mineralogy to his friends in his home; in 1813 he was elected professor of chemistry at Cambridge, and the following year he delivered a course of lectures. In September 1814 he set out on a tour of the southern provinces of France. He was killed in an accident on 22 February 1815 near Boulogne, when a bridge over which he was riding collapsed; he was buried a few days later in the public cemetery at Boulogne.<br>
<br>Tennant never married, and left an estate valued at &pound;5000. He published a total of nine scientific papers (seven of which are listed in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Scientific Papers</span>), mostly on topics in chemical analysis, and was an early member (1799) of London's Askesian Society. His biographer described him as &#145;tall and slender, with a thin face and light complexion, of striking and agreeable appearance, with expressive features and strong marks of intelligence&#146;  (Whishaw, 91).<br>
