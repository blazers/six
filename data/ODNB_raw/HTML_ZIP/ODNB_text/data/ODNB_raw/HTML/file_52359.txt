<span class="headword">Eustace (II)</span> <span class="st"> [Eustace aux Gernons]</span>, count of Boulogne  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1087), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of Eustace (I), count of Boulogne and Lens, and of Matilda, daughter of Lambert, count of Louvain. In 1036, and before his succession to the countship of Boulogne, Eustace (II) married Godgifu 
    (or Goda; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1047)
  , daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8915/', "King &#198;thelred II")</script> and formerly wife of Drogo, count of the Vexin (<i>d</i>. 1035). The marriage fostered an alliance between Eustace and Godgifu's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8516/', "Edward the Confessor")</script>, and the sons of her first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23045/', "Ralph, earl of Hereford (d. 1057)")</script>, and Walter, count of Amiens and the Vexin (<i>d</i>. 1063). Eustace and the counts of Ponthieu and the Vexin used the alliance with Edward to prevent annexation into the Norman or Flemish polities and Edward used the Boulonnais&#150;Picard alliance to counter-balance Flemish aid to his Danish adversaries. Eustace's defence of his alliance with Edward against the newly allied counts of Normandy and Flanders prompted a conflict in 1051&#150;2 with Earl Godwine and his sons, who favoured a pro-Flemish policy. In addition to pursuing ties with the English king to forestall Flemish incorporation, Eustace continued his father's strategy of allying with the nobility of Lower Lorraine. In 1047&#150;9 Eustace joined his maternal kin in the war between Duke Godefroi of Lower Lorraine, and the Holy Roman emperor, Heinrich III.<br>
<br>Shortly after the death of his first wife, Eustace about 1049 married Ida of Lorraine (<i>d</i>. 1113), in order to strengthen his alliance to her father, the duke. The defeat of Eustace and his allies in Lorraine in 1049 and in England in 1052 encouraged the count's support of his Picard and northern Norman kin and allies in the rebellion of Guillaume d'Arques against his nephew the duke of Normandy. The failure of this rebellion led to a period of quiescence and limited co-operation with Count Baudouin (V) of Flanders. In 1066 Eustace changed his family's traditional hostility towards the Norman dukes and joined William of Normandy in the conquest of England. His contributions to the conquest were praised in the <span class="italic">Carmen de Hastingae proelio</span> and portrayed on the Bayeux tapestry. It was here that his moustaches (giving rise to the epithet &#145;aux Gernons&#146;) were immortalized. After a brief estrangement, Eustace and William the Conqueror fought to oust Robert of Flanders, who had usurped the countship from his nephew in 1071. The coalition against Robert included Eustace's brother-in-law Duke Godefroi of Lower Lorraine and, initially, the French king, whose support was encouraged by Eustace's brother Godefroi, bishop of Paris. Despite Robert of Flanders's victory, William and Eustace remained allies and William restored to Eustace the extensive estates he had received shortly after the conquest of England. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> reveals that the count held lands in eleven counties, with the majority of his holdings in Essex. These estates produced an annual income of approximately &pound;770, placing Eustace among the wealthiest lay magnates.<br>
<br>Eustace's marriage to Ida of Lorraine produced three children: Eustace (III), count of Boulogne; Godefroi de Bouillon, duke of Lower Lorraine and later defender of the Holy Sepulchre; and Baudouin I, king of Jerusalem. Eustace also had a bastard son, Geoffroi, who married Beatrice, daughter of Geoffrey de Mandeville. Ida worked to reform monasticism in Boulogne with the encouragement of Anselm of Bec and Hugh, abbot of Cluny, and was considered a saint by her contemporaries. She used her dower lands in Lorraine and well-placed monastic foundations to aid her husband and sons in the maintenance of the family's power. In the early 1080s a genealogy of the comital family of Boulogne was produced which stressed Eustace's Carolingian descent through his mother, Matilda, and his marriage to Ida of Lorraine, and also reflected the prestige the family had gained through Eustace's military prowess. At Eustace's death, <i>c</i>.1087, he was the tenth largest landholder among the Anglo-Norman nobility and a wealthy and independent count in northern France.<br>
