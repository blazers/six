<span class="headword">Wetheringsett <span class="st"> [Wethersett]</span>,  Richard  of</span> <span class="st"> [Richard  of Leicester]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1200&#150;<em>c.</em>1230), <span class="occ">churchman and theologian</span>, is recorded as a student under William de Montibus at Lincoln in the years round 1200. The author of the <span class="italic">summa</span> <span class="italic">Qui bene presunt</span> about 1220, he is the earliest identifiable chancellor of Cambridge University (serving some time between 1215 and 1232); he is not to be confused with the later chancellor Richard Leicester, who served in 1349&#150;50.<br>
<br>Wetheringsett's <span class="italic">summa</span> is a milestone in the history of Christian education in England. It is organized as a guide for preachers, who are first to learn about the most basic elements of &#145;faith and morals&#146;, and then go on to preach about them to the people. He identifies twelve topics for consideration, in a list that, with minor alterations, was to become normative for catechetical preaching during the following centuries. That list begins with the creed and the articles of faith, followed by the Lord's prayer, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the virtues, the vices, the seven sacraments, the two evangelical precepts, the ten commandments, the rewards of heaven and pains of hell, the errors of the people, the things to be avoided, and the things to be done. Although none of these topics was new in the thirteenth century, their being assembled in a programmatic guide for preachers helped to shape the religious literature of England for centuries to come. Its influence can be seen, for instance, in the syllabus of things to be preached regularly by parish priests that Archbishop John Pecham (<i>d</i>. 1292) published in his famous constitution <span class="italic">Ignorantia sacerdotum</span> of 1281. Still unpublished, the <span class="italic">summa</span> survives in some sixty manuscript copies.<br>
<br>Much of what is known about Wetheringsett's life derives from his <span class="italic">summa</span>. It reveals that the author studied under William de Montibus in the cathedral school at Lincoln, some time between 1180 and 1213. However, differences between manuscripts also serve both to obscure his identity and to raise intriguing possibilities about it, referring to him variously as Richard of Leicester, Richard of Wetheringsett, and Richard de Montibus (this last a confusion with Richard's frequently quoted master, William de Montibus). Some manuscripts describe him as rector of the church of Wetheringsett, some as chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and some as chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral (perhaps again a confusion with William de Montibus, also chancellor). One mid-thirteenth-century manuscript neatly reconciles his surnames by identifying him as &#145;Master Richard of Leicester, rector of the church of Wetheringsett&#146;  (Shrewsbury School, MS 7, fol. 109<i>v</i>). There is independent corroboration that the earliest known chancellor of Cambridge was named Richard of Leicester; and the wealthy prebend of Wetheringsett, Suffolk, which was in the gift of the bishop of Ely, who had oversight of Cambridge University, would have provided suitable emolument for the latter's chancellor. Richard is depicted lecturing in the initial &#145;Q&#146; in one copy of <span class="italic">Qui bene presunt</span>, next to a note describing the text as the &#145;summa magistri R. Cancellarii de Kantebrug&#146;  (CUL, MS Additional 3471, fol. 125<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>The evidence that Wetheringsett was also chancellor of Lincoln is less secure, owing to possible confusion with his mentor, William de Montibus. But there is nothing implausible in the notion that, as the author of a highly respected theological <span class="italic">summa</span>, Richard would have been invited to succeed his master as chancellor and head of the Lincoln Cathedral school. This possibility is perhaps strengthened by independent evidence that the chancellor of Lincoln from 1220 to 1228, Richard le Grant, was known by the cognomen de Wethershed, probably a variant of Wetheringsett. This evidence is far from secure, but it raises the possibility that Richard of Wetheringsett, the author of <span class="italic">Qui bene presunt</span>, who was rector of Wetheringsett church and an early chancellor of Cambridge University, is also to be identified with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11283/', "Richard Grant")</script>, chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, and archbishop of Canterbury from 1229 until his premature death in 1231.<br>
