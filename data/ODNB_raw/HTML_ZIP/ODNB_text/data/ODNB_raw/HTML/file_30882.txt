<span class="headword">Bush,  Eric Wheler</span>  (1899&#150;1985), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 12 August 1899 at Simla, the younger son and younger child of the Revd Herbert Wheler Bush, chaplain to the forces, and his wife, Edith Cornelia, daughter of Dr George Cardew, inspector-general of the Indian Medical Service. Mrs Bush returned to England in 1908 with her two sons, leaving her husband as the principal of the Lawrence Memorial School, Murree, until he too returned, to become vicar of Bathford, in 1912. Eric Bush was educated in England at Stoke House, Stoke Poges, and on 10 May 1912 entered the Royal Naval College, Osborne, as a naval cadet.<br>
<br>After two years' general education, &#145;Blake term&#146;, of which he was a member, proceeded to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, but the course was interrupted at the end of the first term by the mobilization of the fleet, on 1 August 1914. Bush was appointed to the armoured cruiser <i>Bacchante</i>, the flagship of the 7th cruiser squadron, and on 28 August 1914 was present at the battle of the Heligoland Bight. After service in the North Sea and English Channel, the cruiser joined the Mediterranean Fleet and was part of the Dardanelles expeditionary force. On 25 April 1915 Midshipman Bush (promoted in the previous October), commanded a picket-boat which towed boats of the first assault wave to land on Anzac beach and for his services on this day and during the month which followed he was awarded the DSC, besides receiving the first of four mentions in dispatches. In August Bush was similarly engaged during the Suvla landings.<br>
<br>In March 1916 he joined the new battleship <i>Revenge</i>, in which he remained until the end of the war, seeing action only at the battle of Jutland. A sub-lieutenant since July 1917, he was one of the 370 naval officers&#151;Kipling's &#145;gentlemen tired of the sea&#146;&#151;whose education had been interrupted and who were sent to Cambridge University in January 1919 for two terms. By his own account, his main achievement appears to have been the hoisting of a large white ensign on the lantern above his college, Trinity.<br>
<br>Bush's inter-war career was typical for the period, with service aboard a destroyer in the Baltic and Home Fleet being followed by commissions in the East Indies, where he qualified as an interpreter in Hindustani in 1924, and on the China station, where, in 1932, he joined his first command, the Yangtze (Yangzi) gunboat <i>Ladybird</i>. Between sea jobs he served as a training officer, his infectious enthusiasm for the service producing an exceptional term (two of whose members were to win VCs), attended the Royal Navy staff course, and, from 1934 to 1936, occupied the naval intelligence division's Japanese desk.<br>
<br>At the end of 1936 Commander Bush was appointed as executive officer of the Mediterranean Fleet cruiser <i>Devonshire</i>. Observation of the fighting during the Spanish Civil War and evacuation of refugees gave the Royal Navy much useful experience, but Bush also found time to get married, on 20 May 1938, during a visit to Cannes, to Mollie No&euml;l, daughter of Colonel Brian Watts DSO, of the Royal Army Medical Corps. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Promoted in June 1939, Bush became captain, auxiliary patrols, on the outbreak of war commanding the variegated collection of minor warships and conscripted fishing vessels which closed the Strait of Dover to German submarines and dealt with the early magnetic mines. His tireless efforts during the Dunkirk evacuation, at which he was responsible for the La Panne beaches, earned him the first of three DSOs. In June 1941 he returned to sea, in command of the anti-aircraft cruiser <i>Euryalus</i>, in which he remained until September 1943, taking part in all the more notable eastern Mediterranean actions during the period and the invasions of Sicily and Salerno.<br>
<br>Acquaintance with amphibious operations was renewed by Bush's appointment in command of the Force Sword assault group, which he trained and led for the Normandy invasion, where he was responsible for landing 8th infantry brigade at Ouistreham, on the exposed eastern flank of the assault area. After brief command of the battleship <i>Malaya</i> in the autumn of 1944, he returned to combined operations as the chief staff officer of Force W, the amphibious component of the south-east Asia command. He commanded the assaults on Akyab and the Arakan coast operations and was largely responsible for the planning and execution of the invasions of Ramree Island and Rangoon and for the unopposed reoccupation of Malaya and Singapore.<br>
<br>From late 1945 until June 1948, Bush commanded HMS <i>Ganges</i>, the boy seamen's training establishment at Shotley, near Harwich. This was to be his last naval appointment, for he was not selected for promotion to flag rank and was retired from the service, shortly before his forty-ninth birthday.<br>
<br>An enthusiast for all matters maritime and dedicated to the encouragement of youth, Bush became the secretary of the sea cadet council (1948&#150;59). Towards the end of this time he wrote and had published (in 1958) his autobiography, <span class="italic">Bless our Ship</span>. His character and personality show through this modest account of a substantial naval career: patriotic without a trace of jingoism or bigotry, his determination and dedication to duty were tempered by kindliness, a keen sense of humour, and love for his wife and two sons, both of whom followed him into the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>Leaving the sea cadet council, Bush next became the general manager of the Red Ensign Club, in Stepney, which he ran until 1964. Even in retirement he continued his association with the sea, being engaged for several years by the British-India Steam Navigation Company as a liaison officer and lecturer accompanying educational cruises. So well received were his lectures on the Gallipoli expedition, he was persuaded to write an excellent account of the campaign (<span class="italic">Gallipoli</span>, 1957) based on meticulous research as well as his own experience. Prior to this, he had compiled two anthologies of poetry and prose, one nautical (<span class="italic">The Flowers of the Sea</span>, 1962) and the other military (<span class="italic">Salute the Soldier</span>, 1966). Bush finally retired from the sea to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where he died on 17 June 1985.<br>
