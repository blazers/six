<span class="headword">Knight,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1719<span class="mult">x</span>24), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and merchant</span>, seems to have been born about 1640 (since he was apparently nearly eighty in 1719), possibly in Bisham, Berkshire, described later as his home in his will; his parents are unknown. A lifelong connection to the Hudson's Bay Company began on 16 May 1676 when he was employed as a carpenter. He appears to have spent the next five years building or rebuilding factories at Rupert, Moose, and Albany rivers in James Bay. Passed over in the appointment of deputy governor in Hudson Bay he returned in 1681 to England, where he reported to the company and advised on preparations for a voyage the following year. A &#145;faithfull and true Serveant&#146; and &#145;able and dexterous in their business&#146;, on 11 May 1682 he was made deputy governor at Hudson Bay and chief factor at Albany on a yearly salary of &pound;100  (Kenney, 25). With his brother, Richard, Knight sailed to Hudson Bay and remained there until 1685 when he returned to England. In December that year he faced, and denied, accusations, made by Governor Henry Sergeant, of private trading. The case concluded in November 1687 with the company unsatisfied with Knight's defence.<br>
<br>Knight does not reappear in company records until five years later when he is described as &#145;of London, merchant&#146;, suggesting his occupation and residence in the intervening period. In March 1692 the company offered him the command of an expedition to protect York Fort and recover the bottom of the bay from the French. Royal letters patent issued on 15 June 1692 made him governor and commander-in-chief of all forts, factories, and territories in Hudson Bay. That month he sailed with the most powerful expedition the company had yet sent, comprising four ships and 213 men. The following summer the forces attacked and took Albany Fort, which became the only fort in English hands from October 1694 until August 1696, when the English retook York Fort. By this time Knight and his wife, Elizabeth, had a son, Gilpin. By the treaty of Ryswick (20 September 1697) Albany was to be returned to the French and York Fort, recently retaken by the French, to the English. In June 1698 the company employed Knight to oversee the exchange; however, it never took place. He travelled to Hudson Bay and for the following two years was governor of Albany on an annual salary of &pound;400, double the amount he had been receiving since April 1693.<br>
<br>By November 1700 Knight had returned to London, where he obtained &pound;400 of company stock; added to the &pound;200 of stock he had acquired in 1692, this made him eligible to sit on the committee of the general court. He was elected the following week, and every subsequent year until November 1713. In 1710 he travelled to the Netherlands &#145;to Soliciter the Company's affaires at the treaty of Peace&#146;  (Kenney, 47). The articles of the treaty of Utrecht (11 April 1713) provided that the French should return Hudson Bay territories to Britain and pay the company for damages. On 11 September 1714 Knight received the formal French surrender at York Fort, and subsequently became governor there.<br>
<br>To further trade Knight set out to improve relations between Crees and Athapascans, and to establish a post on the Churchill River (the latter is recorded in his published journal). He received a number of reports, particularly from a slave woman, Thanadelthur, of a yellow metal, and on his return to England in 1718 he approached the company with plans for an expedition to discover the mines. In June 1719 the expedition departed, instructed to search for a north-west passage. Knight never returned and evidence collected by explorers in the following years suggested that both expedition ships had been wrecked. Almost fifty years later Samuel Hearne confirmed these reports; his interviews with Inuit suggested that some of Knight's party survived two winters on the Marble Island. In the late twentieth century the Marble Island site was excavated and divers investigated the wrecks; although inconclusive, the evidence suggests that perhaps not all of Knight's party died of starvation or scurvy on Marble Island. Knight's will was probated on 23 September 1724. Given that apparently he was almost eighty in 1719 he had probably died soon after arriving on the island  (Robson, appx 1, 37).<br>
