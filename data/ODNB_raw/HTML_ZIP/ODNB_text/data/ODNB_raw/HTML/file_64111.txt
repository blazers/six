<span class="headword">Bathurst,  Charles  Bragge</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1754, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized Charles Bragge on 28 February 1754, elder son among three children of Charles Bragge (<i>d</i>. in or after 1780), landowner, of Cleve Hill, Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire, whose father, from Essex, had married into that estate, and his wife, Anne (1718&#150;1793), daughter of Benjamin Bathurst, politician, of Lydney, Gloucestershire. Educated as founder's kin at Winchester College (from in or before 1770), and at New College, Oxford (from in or before 1772), he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1772, from where he was called to the bar in 1778. He served as bankruptcy commissioner (1778&#150;1800) and secretary to the commissioners of peace (1779&#150;91); his cousin Henry Bathurst was lord chancellor. After practising at Gloucester quarter sessions, he graduated BCL in 1785 and retained his fellowship until he married, on 1 August 1788, Charlotte (1762&#150;1839), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/149/', "Anthony Addington")</script>, physician, and Mary Hiley (<i>d</i>. 1778), of Fringford, Oxfordshire; two sons and two daughters of their nine children survived infancy. This match with the sister of his schoolfellow, Henry Addington, promoted a political career already started under other auspices.<br>
<br>Bragge had been newly appointed recorder of Monmouth through the influence of the duke of Beaufort, whose interest had returned his Bathurst grandfather as MP there, and Bragge too became its member, gratis, on 28 December 1790. He first spoke in parliament against delaying prorogation on 2 June 1791; a contemporary pamphlet upholding impeachments after dissolutions was probably his. Beaufort secured his return in 1796 for Bristol, which he represented until 1812, and he gave strong support to the ministry, championing Pitt against Fox in debate on 14 December 1796. Through the influence of his brother-in-law, Addington, who was speaker, he became counsel to the Board of Control for India in September 1797, and in November chaired the bank committee. Pitt was certain that he would decline his offer of honorary office as queen's solicitor in 1798 as Bragge had opposed Pitt's measure to levy income tax even on taxpayers with large families, such as Bragge's own. He opposed trade unions in 1799, and published a bill to make colliery thefts felonious in 1800. As the first paid chairman of supply, he received &pound;1200 per session from 1799 to 1801.<br>
<br>Addington, who became premier in 1801, wanted Bragge as speaker, but the king apparently objected, despite Bragge's obvious preference for business, electoral, and procedural matters. He was sworn of the privy council on 18 November 1801, and became treasurer of the navy, which brought him an income of &pound;4000 plus a house. Addington, claiming he followed the king's advice, did not consult him on public affairs, and the speakership was again mooted in 1802. Mocked by Pitt's friends, Bragge rebuked Canning for accentuating policy differences between Addington and Pitt on 24 November. In June 1803 he sacrificed his office for a seat on the Board of Trade and, in August, the secretaryship at war, after having declined the India board.<br>
<br>Even though the king praised his business ability, Bragge was often harassed in debate; he refused the Irish chief secretaryship, in January 1804. When Pitt had replaced Addington and Bragge had resigned from office, Bragge questioned his military measures, thereby ignoring Addington's advice to abstain from criticism for reasons of self-interest. He had just acquired his uncle Poole Bathurst's encumbered Lydney estate worth &pound;2500, and taken his surname of Bathurst (on 11 May 1804), and was thus in need of a lucrative office to pay his debts and support his family. He none the less deprecated Addington's action in soliciting for him in negotiations to rejoin Pitt, but he did accept the chairmanship of Gloucestershire quarter sessions. He was plainly embarrassed when Pitt and Addington, now Lord Sidmouth, disagreed over Lord Melville's naval administration, for it was his veto on banking navy funds at Coutts that had triggered the malversation by Melville; Sidmouth was then requesting the duchy of Lancaster on his behalf. Bathurst resumed attendance on the naval committee to investigate Melville's alleged embezzlements and advocated criminal prosecution of Melville. He regretted his divergence from Pitt, and did not, as alleged, pen the pamphlet <span class="italic">A Plain Reply</span>, occasioned by the split between Pitt and Sidmouth.<br>
<br>Bathurst, as Sidmouth discovered after successfully soliciting a cabinet office for him in Grenville's ministry in 1806, would have accepted the War Office, had it been available. Grenville was well disposed towards him, for he backed ministers, particularly over military reorganization, and eventually Bathurst was appointed to the Royal Mint, although he did not take office until the dissolution of parliament, thereby avoiding the costs of a by-election necessitated by his assumption of office. His allegiance to the Grenville administration wavered although he continued to support it: he preferred gradual to immediate slave trade abolition and approved of royal hostility to measures of Catholic relief, as did Sidmouth, who prompted his vocal defence in April 1807 of the king's dismissal of Grenville.<br>
<br>Bathurst was offered the surveyorship of woods and forests in the duke of Portland's ministry, but he declined to take office without Sidmouth. He shone in voicing his opposition to military reformation and to the Copenhagen and Peninsular operations. A ministerial ruse to banish him to India with Vansittart, another staunch supporter of Sidmouth, as commissioners, misfired. His proposed censure of the duke of York for allowing his mistress to dispense military patronage was negatived on 20 March 1809. In May 1809 he supported modest parliamentary reform, but denied the charge of ministerial corruption levelled by William Madocks. When Perceval, as premier, proposed a merger with the Sidmouthites in October 1809, he was tempted with the promise of the War Office and a seat in cabinet, but he advised Sidmouth against parleying without consulting other opposition leaders. Following Sidmouth, he voted for the address in 1810, but supported the Walcheren inquiry, favouring censure. Though guardedly critical of the house's handling of the reformer Sir Francis Burdett, he voted against parliamentary reform on 21 May, and opposed piecemeal abolition of sinecures on 1 June. He discouraged Sidmouth from negotiating office for him, dreading the costs of the ensuing by-election. Yet he stood by Perceval over the regency, and abandoned his motion vetoing the queen's interference. Report then assigned him the exchequer or speakership. Courted on his own by Perceval in January 1812, he preferred to wait for Sidmouth to conclude a deal; he anticipated high office. He eventually attained a cabinet post and the duchy of Lancaster in June 1812, when Lord Liverpool, as premier, included Sidmouthites in his government. To avoid the expenses of a Bristol by-election, Sidmouth procured him Bodmin.<br>
<br>Bathurst subsequently defended ministers on multifarious topics, some beyond his range. He regularly decried Catholic relief and opposed legal and parliamentary reform. A select committeeman on India, he voted for Christian missions in 1813. His championship of the Anglican clergy suggested a wish to represent his university, which created him DCL in 1814. A commissioner for building new churches (1818), he also sat on poor law committees. The chairmanship of secret committees awarded him a new brief denouncing popular radicalism, which he resumed in his last two parliaments, when he represented Harwich. He attributed unrest to abeyant royal authority and foreign example. In 1819 his resignation was rumoured. With additional, unwanted, and unremunerated office as president of the India board from January 1821, he left office and parliament for health reasons in January 1823, having obtained civil-list pensions for himself and his wife that were divisible among their children. Bathurst died at Lydney Park on 13 August 1831 and was buried in Lydney.<br>
