<span class="headword">Kar <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Karamian]</span>,  Ida</span>  (1908&#150;1974), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born in Tambov, Russia, the daughter of Melkon Karamian, a professor of science and mathematics. It is not known from what date she became known as Kar rather than Karamian. Her early childhood was spent in Russia and Persia and the family eventually settled in Alexandria, Egypt, when Kar was thirteen. There she was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Fran&ccedil;ais and then in 1928, aged twenty, she was sent to Paris to study medicine and chemistry. In Paris, Kar abandoned her studies and took courses in singing and the violin. Much of her time was spent working and socializing with avant-garde writers and artists in the Left Bank of the city. She was exposed to the work of international artists and photographers and it was during this time that she became aware of the potential of photography and established an interest in left-wing politics. She returned to Alexandria in 1933.<br>
<br>Kar began to lose her singing voice and so abandoned her musical career and began to work as a receptionist and assistant in a local photographer's studio. In the late 1930s she married Edmond Belali, an Egyptian government official and a very keen amateur photographer. They moved to Cairo and set up their own studio, Idabel. In 1943 and 1944 their work was exhibited in two surrealist exhibitions staged in Cairo. Her photographs attracted the attention of Victor Musgrave (<i>d</i>. 1984), the British artist, art dealer, curator, and critic, and in 1944, when Kar was thirty-six, she divorced Belali and married Musgrave.<br>
<br>In 1945 Kar and Musgrave moved to London and Kar pursued her career as a photographer. The portraits she took of the many artists and writers living and socializing in Soho during the early 1950s were to become the foundation of her subsequent work. Her most famous portraits include those of Jacob Epstein (1953), Bertrand Russell (1952), and Gino Severini (mid-1950s). Throughout her life she craved recognition as an artist and continuously struggled financially. At times she isolated herself by her autocratic and somewhat overbearing personality: &#145;everyone started off loving her and her personality but they ended up saying, &#147;My God, I can't stand any more of this&#148;&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Ida Kar&#151;Photographer</span>, 18).<br>
<br>In 1954 Kar held an exhibition entitled &#145;Forty artists from Paris and London&#146; at Gallery One but it received little critical acclaim. Her portraits were confrontational, simple, but dramatic, showing none of the glamour of earlier portrait photography. Surrealist elements were apparent in some of the work and she often placed her subjects in their studios and homes using only natural lighting. She used a large old plate camera for these portraits but later changed to a rolleiflex for her documentary work. In 1956 Kar embraced a more documentary style and a number of her pictures of London life were published in <span class="italic">Tatler</span> and <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. In 1957 she returned to Armenia on a commission from <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. There she exhibited her photographs of local rural communities and found that she and her work were respected and revered. Optimistic, she returned to London and for the next three years embarked on a period of intense work and travel.<br>
<br>In 1960 Kar exhibited her work at the Whitechapel Art Gallery&#151;it was the first solo photography show held in a major public art gallery in London. The show concentrated on her portraits of artists and writers with a small number of images from Russia and Armenia. It was a great success for Kar and for the future status of photography, generating a huge amount of press. The exhibition was the pinnacle of her achievement and the catalyst for some of her best work. The exhibition design was also innovative, with some of the photographs blown up to a huge scale&#151;in some cases as large as 4 by 5 feet. In 1962 Kar held another successful exhibition at Moscow's House of Friendship but her biographer, Val Williams, recorded that &#145;her major projects were invariably accompanied by storms and upsets &hellip; to many potential clients and gallery curators, she was a difficult woman, and better avoided&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Ida Kar&#151;Photographer</span>, 53). In 1963 Kar became a regular photographer for <span class="italic">Animals</span> magazine&#151;but it was a post that lasted only a year. During this time she exhibited some work in Birmingham and London and opportunities for teaching and lecturing were frequent. However, her rather formal approach to portraiture was becoming increasingly unfashionable and financial worries continued to dominate her life.<br>
<br>After a trip to Cuba in 1964 Kar began to show signs of acute manic depression, paranoia, and obsessive behaviour. She separated from her husband in 1969. After this, and up until her death, Kar suffered several breakdowns and was frequently hospitalized. She died on 24 December 1974 of thrombosis, virtually forgotten, at Inverness Terrace, a Bayswater bedsit. She was cremated at Golders Green. Her work did much to advance the status of photography in Britain and provided an important social record of London in the 1950s. Her archive is now held at the National Portrait Gallery and her work is widely collected by museums around the world.<br>
