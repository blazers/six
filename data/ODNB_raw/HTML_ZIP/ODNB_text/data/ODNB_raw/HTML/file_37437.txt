<span class="headword">Fry,  Thomas</span>  (1718&#150;1772), <span class="occ">classical scholar and college head</span>, was the son of Thomas Fry, of Pipe Lane, Bristol. He was educated at Bristol grammar school until 1732, and was then admitted to St John's College, Oxford, as a Bristol fellow. He took his BA degree in 1736, was MA in 1740, and took priest's orders in 1744, a BD in 1745, and a DD in 1750.<br>
<br>Regularly resident in college during term, Fry held most college offices, beginning as logic reader in 1737&#150;40. He was dean of arts in 1740&#150;44, natural philosophy reader in 1740&#150;41 and 1745&#150;6, the college preacher in 1743&#150;4 and 1746&#150;7, and dean of divinity in 1750&#150;51. He served the college as Waple's preacher (1748&#150;9) and the Wood bursar (1748&#150;9, 1755&#150;6), and became senior bursar (1751&#150;2), junior bursar (1752&#150;3), and rhetoric lecturer (1755). Having been twice vice-president (1754&#150;5 and 1757&#150;8), he was elected president of St John's College on 9 December 1757 on the resignation of William Walker. Fry was curate in three college livings between 1749 and 1757&#151;St Giles', Oxford (1749), Fyfield until 1755, and Kirtlington (1755&#150;7)&#151;and so he was often an absentee incumbent. In 1757, on being elected president, he became rector of Hanborough.<br>
<br>Fry was determined to uphold the authority of the president; in 1766 he was upset by the appointment of a new steward (who oversaw the domestic arrangements of the college) which had been made at a meeting presided over by the vice-president. Fry persuaded eight of the senior fellows to protest at the action and overruled the appointment on the ground that the proceedings were contrary to statute. Later the same day, with a new vice-president and the senior bursar, he elected the same man steward and clerk of accounts. However, he does not seem to have felt so strongly about public affairs, for in May 1768 he refused a seat on the bench: &#145;The Master of Ball. [Balliol] pressed me much to have my name inserted in the new Commissn for the Peace, but I absolutely declined it. Clergymen have no business to concern themselves with Civil affairs&#146;  (St John's College Records).<br>
<br>In the diary covering the last four years of his life there is little mention of books, but he had brought out an edition of Aristophanes' <span class="italic">Plutus</span> and <span class="italic">Clouds</span> in 1767. It is plain that food was one of his permanent interests, and he faithfully records details of dinners, with comments on the madeira in the common-room cellar. This perhaps accounts for the gout from which he suffered in 1771 and for which he collected prescriptions from friends.<br>
<br>As an old friend of John Wilkes, Fry seems to have been, if not an active radical, at least a passive sympathizer. When in 1768 action was taken against young members of the university influenced by Methodism, he commented:<blockquote>The V.C. acknowledg'd that the characters of the men were very unexceptionable in every respect &hellip; but the Statutes of the Univy, he thought, obliged him to proceed in this Manner&#151;thus is Persecution carried on under the masque of Mildness and Moderation. (St John's College muniments, 75, D7)</blockquote>Fry was a tolerant man, who enjoyed solitude; he had protestant sympathies, but gave no sign of any antipathy to Catholicism. He never married and died intestate in Bristol on 22 November 1772. He was buried in the churchyard at Clifton.<br>
