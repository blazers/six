<span class="headword">Dixwell,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>James Davids]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1607&#150;1689), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was the younger son of Edward Dixwell of Coton, Warwickshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hawksworth), although he may have been brought up by an uncle, Sir Basil Dixwell of Brome in Kent. Dixwell was living at Folkestone when he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1631. He was called to the bar on 30 January 1638. His elder brother, Mark Dixwell, was an active parliamentarian during the early part of the civil war, and upon his death in February 1644 Dixwell succeeded to the sizeable estate which Mark had inherited from their uncle and became guardian of his brother's children. Having been active in promoting godly reformation during the early 1640s, and as a captain of the Kentish militia, Dixwell assumed a prominent role in organizing the parliamentarian war effort in the county and received numerous commissions from parliament. He was appointed to the committee for sequestrations in Kent and made a commissioner for the New Model Army. More importantly, he served on both the county committee and the commission of the peace. Such zeal for the parliamentarian cause resulted in his being elected to parliament as MP for Dover in 1646. His appearances at Westminster were probably rare, however, since he remained preoccupied with Kentish business, not least during the royalist rising of 1648. By the summer of 1647 it had become clear that he was aligned with the political independents and the army at Westminster, although it was only after Pride's Purge in December 1648 that he assumed a position of prominence in the House of Commons, where he was appointed to the committee for plundered ministers and the navy committee. Nominated as one of the commissioners for the trial of Charles I, he attended the majority of their meetings, as well as every day of the trial in Westminster Hall, and signed the death warrant on 29 January 1649 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>During the Commonwealth, Dixwell's political allies were committed republicans such as Edmund Ludlow, although he also remained active in the county as a militia officer and, after January 1652, as governor of Dover Castle. In November 1651 he was elected to the council of state, on which he served until November 1652, being particularly active in relation to admiralty business. Although he may have been opposed to the dissolution of the Rump and the establishment of the protectorate, he was not an active opponent of Oliver Cromwell, and remained willing to serve in parliament. He was returned as a knight of the shire for Kent in both 1654 and 1656, and member for Dover during the parliament of Richard Cromwell in 1659. He did not resume an active role in political events, however, until the recall of the Rump in May 1659, when he was elected to the council of state and confirmed as governor of Dover Castle. His allegiance was to civilian rather than military rule, and after the interruption of the Rump by the army in the autumn of 1659 Dixwell's control of Dover was important to the campaign against John Lambert and the Wallingford House party.<br>
<br>Having recognized the drift towards a restoration of the Stuart dynasty in early 1660, Dixwell sold at least part of his estate and fled to the continent to escape arrest and execution for his role in the trial of Charles I. He travelled to Hanau with other regicides, but subsequently sought greater safety in New England, where he was recorded as having arrived by 1665. He eventually settled in New Haven, where he lived until his death under the assumed name of James Davids. Upon settling in New Haven, Dixwell married Joanna, widow of a Mr Ling, in November 1673, although she died almost immediately. In 1677 he married Bathsheba How (<i>d</i>. 1729), with whom he had a son and two daughters. He made a settlement of his estate in 1682, although the deeds were not made public until after his death, in the interest of preserving his anonymity. A portion of his lands in England had successfully been concealed from the crown and had evaded confiscation by the government of Charles II. One of Dixwell's papers contained a comment which displayed his continued support for the policies and ideas which had forced him to flee England. He expressed his confidence that &#145;the Lord will appear for his people, and the good old cause for which I suffer, and that there will be those in power again who will relieve the injured and oppressed&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 5th ser., 9, 1878, 466).<br>
<br>Although Dixwell's friends, including the old republican John Wildman, saw the revolution of 1688 as an opportunity for him to return to England, they were unaware that he had died on 18 March 1689 at New Haven, where he was buried, before the news of William III's arrival reached New England. In New Haven Dixwell and his fellow regicides Edward Whalley and William Goffe (whom he is known to have visited at their refuge in Hadley, Massachusetts, in February 1665) are commemorated in the names of streets which branch off from a common intersection.<br>
