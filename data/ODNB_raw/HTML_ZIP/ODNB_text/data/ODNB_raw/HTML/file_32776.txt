<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deller, Sir  Edwin</span>  (1883&#150;1936), <span class="occ">university administrator</span>, was born at Paignton, Devon, on 16 March 1883, the son of Edwin Deller, carpenter, of Paignton, and his wife, Mary Ann Stone. He was educated at local schools up to the age of fourteen, when he began work as a clerk for an uncle at Paignton. He went to London at the age of about twenty and worked as a clerk in various offices. He was then employed by Kent education committee until 1912, when he became a secretary in the academic department of London University. He was already a member of the university, for he had matriculated in 1908 as an evening student at King's College, graduating LLB in 1911. He obtained the degree of LLD in 1916 with a thesis entitled &#145;The liberty of the subject&#146;, as a student of University College. He also studied at the London School of Economics. In 1914 he married Winifred Lilian (Betty), eldest daughter of Benjamin Willey Betts, embosser and chaser, of Hornsey; they had a son.<br>
<br>Deller's career on the staff of London University was rapid. In 1921 he became academic registrar and in 1929 he was elected principal of the university in succession to the geologist Sir Franklin Sibly, whose period of office had not been entirely successful. He was a born administrator and a man of great culture and knowledge of the world, while his quickness of intuition made him skilful in handling men and situations. He seldom intervened in debate, but when he did, he would settle a point by a few brief words, wise and tactful, and often touched with a quiet and irresistible humour. He had a quick eye for the heart of any problem, and an equability of temper which was of great value in handling the often heated controversies that confronted him during his term of office. Above all, he was a man of striking personality and charm, whose open-hearted friendliness and quiet wisdom spread a much-needed spirit of goodwill and co-operation in the university, upon which the erection of the central buildings in Bloomsbury set the crown. In the organization of these buildings, the commissioning of an architect (Charles Holden), and the general policy of the development of the site Deller made a great contribution, often working closely with William Beveridge. He was not destined to see the buildings' completion, however. He died in University College Hospital, London, on 30 November 1936 from the effects of an accident which had occurred three days earlier when he was visiting the great tower, then in the course of construction. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Outside the university, Deller played a great part in founding the British Institute in Paris. In 1926 he visited the United States of America, and on his return wrote an excellent book, <span class="italic">Universities in the United States</span> (1927). He was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1932 and was knighted in 1935. Among other distinctions he was elected an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple in 1933.<br>
