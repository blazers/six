<span class="headword">Bevan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Shuttleworth]</span>,  (Emma) Frances</span>  (1827&#150;1909), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, was born in Oxford on 25 September 1827, the eldest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25492/', "Philip Nicholas Shuttleworth (1782&#150;1842)")</script>, warden of New College, Oxford (1822&#150;40), and bishop of Chichester (1840&#150;42), and Emma Martha Welch. Her father was anti-Tractarian and her mother pious: according to Henry Fox (later fourth Lord Holland), &#145;prim, precise and very dull&#146;  (Webster, 23). Intellectual from childhood, when her father enquired if she wished to take a story-book with her on a journey, she replied, &#145;No thank you Papa, I have my book on pneumatics to take with me&#146;  (ibid., 25). A gifted artist&#151;apparently as a child her drawing won the praise of John Ruskin&#151;she painted the reredos at Fosbury church, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Frances developed high-church views. But when living with her widowed mother at Wykenham Rise, Totteridge, Middlesex, she met the evangelical Anglican <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47420/', "Robert Cooper Lee Bevan (1809&#150;1890)")</script>, a banker and eventually chairman of Barclay, Bevan, Tritton &amp; Co. She became his second wife on 30 April 1856, and they resided at Trent Park, East Barnet, Hertfordshire, and later at 25 Prince's Gate, London. Bevan had four sons and two daughters from his first marriage, and he and Frances had eight children who survived into adulthood: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31868/', "Anthony Ashley Bevan (1859&#150;1933)")</script>, who became professor of Semitic languages at Trinity College, Cambridge; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31869/', "Edwyn Robert Bevan (1870&#150;1943)")</script>, later a religious scholar; and Hubert, Millicent, Gladys, Gwendolen, Enid, and Nesta. Shortly after her marriage Frances joined the Plymouth Brethren in Barnet. Her husband, however, remained Church of England.<br>
<br>Frances withdrew from society. She was distant from family life, not giving her children toys but only &#145;useful&#146; presents and not permitting them fiction&#151;although she did take pleasure in the writings of Lewis Carroll. She dressed in black with no ornamentation (but paradoxically allowing cosmetics), and her &#145;tall, majestic figure&#146;  (ibid., 38) had an &#145;air of command&#146;  (ibid., 71). She spoke French and German well, and published her first book of verse translations from German in 1858. Two similar works followed in 1859 and 1884. <span class="italic">Hymns of Ter Steegen, Suso and Others</span> (2 vols., 1894&#150;7) became her most widely known collection and works from it passed into various church hymnaries. &#145;Sinners Jesus will Receive&#146;, a translation of a hymn by the Lutheran Erdmann Neumeister, enjoyed considerable popularity. As a translator she was not exact, and compared with, for example, John Wesley, passion is restrained. Among her own compositions, &#145;Midst the darkness, storm and sorrow&#146;, a Brethren standard, gave quintessential expression to her individualistic, other-worldly mysticism, and &#145;Christ, the Son of God, hath sent me&#146; was a missionary favourite. In addition she produced religious tracts and seven books, mainly sketches of individuals such as the medieval mystic Mechtild von Magdeburg, the pietist Gerhardt Tersteegen, and John Wesley. Writing with a strong animus against Roman Catholicism, she attempted to trace an evangelical succession&#151;often represented by capable women&#151;which stressed divine grace and assurance of salvation. Tersteegen's piety she found particularly congenial.<br>
<br>Due to Robert Bevan's gout, in later years the family spent the winter in Cannes, where Frances engaged in philanthropic activities. Even at the age of seventy she rose to read Hebrew at 8.30 a.m. She died on 15 March 1909 at Ch&acirc;let Passiflora, Cannes.<br>
