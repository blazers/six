<span class="headword">Weldon,  Ralph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1606, <em>d.</em> 1676), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was baptized at Swanscombe, Kent, on 12 January 1606, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28988/', "Sir Anthony Weldon (bap. 1583, d. 1648)")</script> of Swanscombe, and his wife, Elinor (1588&#150;1622), daughter of George Wilmer. His father held the office of clerk of the green cloth under James I and became the leading parliamentarian committeeman in Kent during the civil war. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28989/', "Anthony Weldon")</script>, another parliamentarian army officer of note, was one of Ralph's seven younger brothers. Ralph Weldon was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, on 24 November 1620 and matriculated in 1621. Some time before 1639 he subsequently married the widow of Thomas Francklyn, probably the Mary who later appears as his wife; when Weldon was called upon to pay Francklyn's debts the accounts committee of Essex did &#145;much marvel he took no notice&#146;  (Everitt, 183).<br>
<br>Ralph Weldon was serving as a parliamentarian captain by September 1643, but quarrelled with his superior officer, Sir Michael Livesey. He was offered a commission under the earl of Essex, but according to his father, in a statement which may perhaps reflect his own attitudes more than those of his son, Ralph refused it on the ground that Kent should maintain control over its own forces. He served as colonel under Sir William Waller in 1644 in command of a regiment of foot raised in Kent, and his regiment was selected for the New Model Army the following year. On 10 March 1645 the House of Lords approved his officers' commissions, and Fairfax subsequently appointed Weldon &#145;as eldest Colonel&#146;  (Sprigge, 17), to command the brigade of 2000 horse and 4000&#150;5000 foot sent to relieve Taunton, a task they accomplished on 11 May. Consequently Weldon was absent from Naseby, but he was active in engagements at Bridgwater and Bristol. On 10 September Weldon's brigade, storming the well-fortified south side of Bristol, lost 100 men &#145;by reason of the height of the Works &hellip; and the shortness of the Ladders&#146;  (Sprigge, 116). On 16 October Weldon's forces overran Tiverton and on 25 October parliament commissioned him governor of Plymouth. His regiment saw further action in 1646 at the siege of Exeter and captured Charles Fort and Inchmere House for parliament.<br>
<br>In April 1647 Weldon's regiment mustered 124 officers and 1060 men. When his soldiers' arrears of pay grew extreme Weldon raised money for them on his personal bond. He wrote to Speaker Lenthall on 30 July: &#145;I have now no way left, but in most humble manner to lay down the command of this garrison of Plymouth to the honourable houses of parliament, who were pleased to bestow it on me without my knowledge&#146;  (Cary, 1.324&#150;5). On 2 August, with his soldiers enduring famine, and in fear for his life, he requisitioned &pound;500 out of the customs house to buy them bread. On 27 August he wrote to Lenthall complaining that he was reduced to forced billeting and that parliament had ignored his letter of resignation. He spent a staggering &pound;6000 on settling his soldiers' debts to Plymouth's inhabitants, a sum apparently never fully repaid. Robert Lilburne succeeded to command his regiment upon his retirement.<br>
<br>On 12 February 1653 Weldon's wife, Mary, was buried. In or before 1656 he married Ellen or Eleanor; their son George was buried on 17 April 1662, aged five; their daughter Elinor (<i>bap</i>. 1660) was buried on 15 February 1662; and their daughter Elizabeth was baptized on 22 August 1662. Weldon was MP for Kent in the protectorate parliaments of 1654 and 1656. On 23 December 1656 the &pound;3300 still owed to Weldon was ordered to be paid out of the arrear assessments of the City of London, but on 6 June 1657 the House of Commons had to reiterate orders for him to receive &pound;4000. In 1663 the Restoration government received information against Weldon that:<blockquote>He was a hater of monarchy, a seeker for popularity, rather an Anabaptist than a presbyterian, as he pretends to be. Before the Restoration he declared himself a Commonwealth man; he has called the punishment of the horrid regicides martyrdom; he is suspected of being implicated in the last two attempts against the King, and makes his house a resort for discontented persons. (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 406)</blockquote>On 12 May 1676 &#145;not likely to continue long in this world&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/373, fol. 107<i>v</i>) Weldon made his will. His wife had died in 1669, and he made his son Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1698) his executor, who proved the will on 4 May 1683.<br>
