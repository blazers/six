<span class="headword">Palmer,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>George Giros  de Gentilly]</span>  (1745/6&#150;1826), <span class="occ">chemist and colour scientist</span>, was, according to his obituary  (<span class="italic">Dagen</span>, March 1826), of English birth and the child of Roman Catholic parents. He may have been related to Thomas Palmer, whose prosperous family firm, established at 118 St Martin's Lane, Westminster, was prominent in the supply and fitting of window glass. Its speciality was coloured glass, and Thomas Palmer supplied stained glass to Horace Walpole, fourth earl of Orford, for Strawberry Hill.<br>
<br>In an autobiographical , published in Leipzig in 1803, George Palmer claimed that, aged twenty-six, he witnessed the fire at the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, Paris, in 1772. Soon after this Palmer appears to have taken on, and retained, the alternative name George Giros de Gentilly. In December 1776 a Mr Gentilly is recorded as presenting samples of cloth &#145;in shades from Flesh colour to Maroon&#146; to the chemistry committee of the Royal Society of Arts  (RSA, PR.GE/112/12/18). In the following year he published in London, as George Palmer, his <span class="italic">Theory of Colours and Vision</span>, which appeared in a French edition (translated by the textile manufacturer Denis-Bernard Quatrem&egrave;re d'Isjonval) later that year. In this study&#151;the first to put forward the modern theory of colour vision and colour blindness. In his <span class="italic">Theory of Light and Colour</span> (1777) he suggested that the retina of the eye contains three different kinds of particle (elsewhere he speaks of &#145;molecules&#146; or &#145;fibres&#146;), each of which is excited by a different kind of light. &#145;The complete and uniform motion of these particles produces the sensation of white.&#146; Colour blindness, he correctly supposed, arose when either one or two of the three types of molecules were non-functional. He also introduced the idea that different sensory fibres within the normal retina could be selectively fatigued, so as to yield coloured after-images. He suggested that a residual motion of the fibres was present in the dark, so that true blacks could be seen only in daylight, by comparison with surrounding objects. Although Palmer's theory of the physics of colour was mistaken (he held there were three discrete forms of light), it is remarkable that this tradesman, or &#145;chemist&#146; as he identified himself in his <span class="italic">Theory</span>, came so close to a modern account of the physiology of colour vision. It remained for an establishment scientist, Thomas Young, to suggest in 1802 that the physical variable underlying colour is a continuous one, whereas Palmer's idea of three discrete receptors is correct at the retinal level.<br>
<br>Although largely unrecognized by the scientific establishment in England, Palmer enjoyed some contemporary recognition on the continent: his explanation of colour blindness first appeared in a secondary account by J. H. Voigt in <span class="italic">Magazin f&uuml;r das Neuste aus der Physik</span> (1781) in which Voigt named him as Giros de Gentilly and identified him as &#145;Georg Palmer&#146;. Palmer's work was also cited in such texts as J. S. T. Gehler's <span class="italic">Physikalisches W&ouml;rterbuch</span>, while the <span class="italic">Theory</span> was extravagantly reviewed in the <span class="italic">Journal Encyclop&eacute;dique</span>. About this time Gentilly worked for a textile manufacturer in Louviers, where he invented a mordant for dyeing fabrics with wood extract dyes  (Berthollet and Berthollet, 2.327&#150;8). Between 1785 and 1787 he lived at 18 rue Mesl&eacute;e, Paris; Watin's <span class="italic">Directory</span> gives his business there as the supply of &#145;verres color&eacute;s adapt&eacute;s aux verres ordinaires&#146;. In Paris he arranged for the publication of his monograph on artificial daylight, <span class="italic">Lettre sur les moyens de produire, la nuit, une lumi&egrave;re pareille &agrave; celle du jour</span> (1785), and a second essay on light and vision, <span class="italic">Th&eacute;orie de la lumi&egrave;re, applicable aux arts, et principalement &agrave; la peinture</span> (1786). Palmer's texts on artificial daylight coincided with his involvement with Antoine-Arnoult Quinquet and Ambroise Bonaventure Lange, who were responsible for illegally manufacturing a double air-current oil lamp, from an original design by the Swiss inventor Fran&ccedil;ois-Pierre-Ami Argand. Palmer's precise role remains unclear and may have been limited to designing the blue-tinted glass shade that enabled lamp light to resemble natural light.<br>
<br>In the 1790s Palmer returned to the development of dyes. Two letters to the Royal Society of Arts  (June 1793, RSA, PR.MC/105/10/452) describe his recent invention of a yellow dye as well as confirming his English origin and his authorship of the <span class="italic">Theory of Colours and Vision</span>. Palmer's letters were sent to the society from Florence and he may later have resided in Goslar, Germany, according to four pamphlets published in 1803; later reviews of these works suggest he also lived in Braunschweig and Wolfenb&uuml;ttel in Lower Saxony. About 1811 Palmer moved to Copenhagen, where he died in poverty on 3 March 1826.<br>
