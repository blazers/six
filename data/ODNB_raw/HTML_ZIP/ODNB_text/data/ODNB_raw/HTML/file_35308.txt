<span class="headword">Oliver, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1853&#150;1942), <span class="occ">physician and authority on industrial hygiene</span>, was born at St Quivox, Ayrshire, on 2 March 1853, the second of the nine children of James Oliver (1824?&#150;1904), grocer, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas McMurtrie. He was educated at Ayr Academy and at Glasgow University, where he graduated MB, CM, with commendation (1874), and MD with honours (1880). He visited Paris for postgraduate study and worked under Jean Martin Charcot, whose lectures on disseminated sclerosis he edited and translated for publication in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical Journal</span> in 1876. He acted for a short period as assistant pathologist at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, but in 1875 he set up in practice at Preston, Lancashire. Here he remained until 1879 when he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. He was elected physician to the Royal Victoria Infirmary and to the Princess Mary Maternity Hospital. In 1880 he was appointed lecturer in physiology in the medical school at Newcastle, which was attached to the University of Durham. He was promoted to a chair in 1889, which he held until 1911 when he became professor of medicine. Oliver married first, in November 1881, Edith Rosina (1852&#150;1888), daughter of William Jenkins, of Consett Hall, co. Durham; and second, in 1893, Emily Octavia (1853/4&#150;1912), daughter of John Anthony Woods, of Benton Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne. There were three daughters and a son from the first marriage and a daughter and a son from the second marriage.<br>
<br>At Newcastle, Oliver came into practical contact with industrial disease and developed an abiding interest in this area of medicine. He was elected FRCP in 1890 and his Goulstonian lectures in the following year were devoted to the subject of lead poisoning. He soon became closely involved in the investigation, exposure, and regulation not only of occupational lead poisoning, but also of a variety of health hazards in the so-called dangerous trades. Oliver served on a number of official inquiries, the first of which was the departmental committee on white lead in 1893, which successfully recommended restrictions on female employment. In 1898 he was appointed with T. E. Thorpe to inquire into the extensive poisoning from the glazes used in various industries in the Potteries, an inquiry which necessitated visits to similar industrial bases in France and Germany. In spite of much opposition from pottery manufacturers, their recommendations helped to bring about reforms which materially reduced the danger to operatives. Also in 1898 Oliver represented the Home Office at the Madrid International Congress on Hygiene. He was the medical expert during the Home Office inquiry on the use of phosphorus in the manufacture of lucifer matches in 1898&#150;9, and a member of the important dangerous trades committee from 1896 to 1899. The extent of Oliver's participation in official inquiries was such that he deserves to be seen as a pioneer figure in the creation of a healthier workplace.<br>
<br>Oliver's most important publications were <span class="italic">Lead Poisoning in its Acute and Chronic Forms</span> (Goulstonian lectures, 1891); a translation of work by Charles Jacques Bouchard, <span class="italic">Lectures on Auto-Intoxication in Disease</span> (1894); <span class="italic">Dangerous Trades</span>, a valuable survey which he edited in 1902; <span class="italic">Diseases of Occupation from the Legislative, Social, and Medical Points of View</span> (1908); <span class="italic">Occupations from the Social, Hygienic and Medical Points of View</span> (1916); <span class="italic">The Health of the Workers</span> (1925); and <span class="italic">The Health of the Child of School Age</span>, which he edited in 1927. He also published extensively in the medical press.<br>
<br>Oliver's work for the improvement of industrial conditions took him to the United States, where he received the freedom of the city of Boston (1923); to France, where he was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1929) and was given the gold medal of the Assistance Publique (1924); and to Belgium, where he was given a medal of honour by the University of Brussels (1920). In 1921 he was a delegate of the Australian commonwealth to the International Labour Conference at Geneva. In 1931 at Geneva he was honorary president of the International Congress of Accidents and Industrial Diseases. He was president of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene from 1937 to 1942. Oliver, who was knighted in 1908, was a JP for Newcastle upon Tyne and a deputy lieutenant for Northumberland. He was awarded the honorary degrees of LLD, Glasgow (1903), DSc, Sheffield (1908), and DCL, Durham (1921). During the First World War he helped to raise the Tyneside Scottish brigade of which he became honorary colonel.<br>
<br>Oliver retired from the chair of medicine in 1927, but he continued as president of the Durham College of Medicine (1926&#150;34). He was vice-chancellor of the University of Durham from 1928 to 1930. At the age of eighty-six he had a leg amputated. Although he made a good recovery, with the help of an artificial limb, he spent much of his final years in a wheelchair. Oliver was a serious and dignified man who cut an imposing figure. His main leisure activities were fishing and shooting. He was chairman of the Tyneside Geographical Society for over thirty years and for many years he was also president of the Tyneside Sunday Lecture Society. He died at his home at 7 Ellison Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 15 May 1942, and was buried on 19 May at Jesmond old cemetery.<br>
