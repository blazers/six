<span class="headword">Halland,  Gordon Herbert Ramsay</span>  (1888&#150;1981), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at the vicarage, Witham on the Hill, Lincolnshire, on 13 April 1888, the elder son (there were also two older daughters) of John Thomas Halland (1857&#150;1941), vicar of Witham on the Hill and later rector of Blyborough, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ramsay (1857&#150;1939). He was educated privately, and then at the Royal Latin School, Buckingham, after which in 1906 he became science master at Kirton grammar school, Lincolnshire. In 1908, &#145;on the spur of the moment&#146;  (&#145;Punjab patrol&#146;), he joined the Indian police and chose to serve in the Punjab. After a period of training and probation he was second in command of the policing operation for the 1911 Delhi durbar, and after some successful special operations against bandits he had by 1914 attained the rank of district superintendent.<br>
<br>In 1915, because of his experience in working among Sikhs, Halland was seconded to the Indian army's general staff as an intelligence officer with the task of countering subversion in the Sikh regiments of the Indian army. He married in 1916 Helen Claudine Blanche (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of Major-General John McNeill Walter, adjutant-general in India; they had two daughters. Promoted major, he was appointed OBE in 1918, and in 1919 he was sent by the commander-in-chief's officer to investigate the situation in the Punjab following the shootings in Amritsar. Halland protested against General Dyer's infamous &#145;crawling order&#146;, which forced Indians to crawl past the site of an attack on a British woman. He opposed such collective punishment as contrary to British justice and likely to alienate otherwise loyal Indians. The order was rescinded soon afterwards. He did not condemn Dyer's actions in initially opening fire on the crowd in the Jallianwalla Bagh, but many years later he distanced himself from the massacre, condemning the indiscriminate shooting as disproportionate.<br>
<br>Home on leave in 1920 Halland was &#145;lent&#146; by the India Office to help the fight against the IRA during the Anglo-Irish war, although his exact role is unclear. On returning to India at the start of 1921 he became commandant of the Punjab police school at Phillaur, responsible for training the Indian middle ranks, and the largely British senior officers. Later he argued (unsuccessfully) against British clubs excluding senior Indian policemen, and was a supporter of the progressive &#145;Indianization&#146; of the upper ranks of the Indian police and civil service as a necessary part of the imperial doctrine of trusteeship.<br>
<br>After his leave in 1926, when he attended a training course at Scotland Yard and organized a squad of Indian empire officers as special constables during the general strike, Halland returned as the superintendent in charge of Amritsar district, but his routine service in the Punjab was again cut short. In 1927 several regiments of the Indian army were sent to Shanghai to protect the international settlement there as part of the international (but British-led) Shanghai defence force. Halland returned to the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, as an intelligence officer on the defence force's staff, monitoring potential subversion, before returning to India as senior superintendent in charge of Delhi. In October 1931 he retired from the Indian police (collecting a CIE and the honorary rank of colonel) to take up the post, at the age of forty-three, of chief constable for the police of Lincolnshire, his home county; this shift from colonial to county police forces was not unusual at the time.<br>
<br>After a short and uneventful time in Lincolnshire, Halland began a second career in the mainstream of British policing. He made his mark when the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Lord Trenchard, selected him in 1933 to be the first commandant of the new police college at Hendon, which was designed to train high-flyers for top positions in the police service. It had that task in common with the RAF College at Cranwell in Lincolnshire, and Halland drew on this model and on that of Sandhurst in setting up Hendon's staffing, organization, and routine: matters in which Trenchard gave him wide discretion. As commandant at Hendon, although he mandated education in law, science, and police methods, he set great store by competitive games both within the college and outside it. He was as keen for the instructing staff at Hendon to be young, athletic, and &#145;gentlemen&#146; as for them to possess up-to-date theoretical and technical expertise. Leading the college from its inception in 1934 until 1938, just a few months before it was closed by the outbreak of war, he had great influence on the cadre of senior policemen whose dominance of the service in the 1950s and 1960s inaugurated a new era of professionalism, even as it created strong opposition among both junior and senior police.<br>
<br>The next ten years of Halland's career were dominated by war. In August 1938 he was appointed inspector of constabulary for southern England and almost immediately was preoccupied with the preparations for wartime police duties, which accelerated with the Munich crisis the next month. The wartime measures for emergency policing led to increasing Home Office intervention in the affairs of provincial forces, in which the inspectorate played a key role. He presided over a period of mechanization of the service, which he did not oppose, but his concerns were with men rather than <i>materiel</i>: in 1939 he was one of the first to express an anxiety, which became far more widespread in later decades, that the use of telephones, radio, and cars was making the job of policing more akin to that of the fire brigade, and taking them away from their traditional preventive role in which they enjoyed everyday contact with the public.<br>
<br>In October 1942 Halland was sent to Ceylon to reorganize the police there. This was a tricky task since, unlike the police in India, the police in Ceylon reported to the locally elected government as well as to the governor. Everything went wrong in Ceylon: he was forced to resign in the spring of 1944 when his deteriorating relations with the home affairs minister, Arunachalam Mahadeva, broke down completely. This might have been expected, given tensions between colonizers and colonized, but he had also alienated all ranks of the police, the British settler establishment, and the governor-general himself. Perhaps his only supporters were the four Metropolitan Police officers (including Peter Brodie and John Waldron, both later to attain high rank) whom he brought over to help implement his plans. Despite his personal failure, however, his restructuring plan was successfully implemented.<br>
<br>The Colonial Office had no further use for Halland's services, but in September 1944 the Home Office recommended him for one of the most important jobs in their gift, &#145;loaning&#146; him to the Foreign Office to be director of public safety for the Allied Control Commission for Germany, setting up the structure (and, crucially, selecting the officers) for ensuring order in occupied Germany and remodelling its police along democratic lines. He then served in Germany as inspector-general of the public safety branch itself, competently and faithfully, despite the tragedy of the sudden death of his wife. The branch came in for criticism at the time because, following the priorities set out by Halland in 1944, it gave greater importance to establishing a German police service in the democratic style than to directly fighting crime and corruption in the British sector. In 1947 he was replaced as head by his deputy, Michael Sylvester O'Rorke, and reverted to his peacetime role as inspector of constabulary.<br>
<br>Halland retired as inspector of constabulary in 1954, after which he served as a county councillor and deputy lieutenant for Lincolnshire until 1957. He was remarried in 1947 to Baroness Sigrid von der Recke, <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Lutzau (1909&#150;1996), of Windau, Latvia. They settled in Gloucestershire, where he died at Broadlands, The Park, Cirencester Road, Minchinhampton, on 28 March 1981.<br>
<br>Halland's personal style was autocratic, and his devotion to the empire was absolute, but the kind of policing whose virtues he extolled (often in the face of opposition) was civilian, law-based, and human-centred. In the 1930s the vicar's son described himself as &#145;not a very religious man&#146;  (Halland to Trenchard, 3 Oct 1933, TNA: PRO, MEPO 2/5846/16), although by 1978 his deep Christian faith&#151;along with his commitment to the police service, to order, and to anti-communism&#151;was apparent in a volume of poems, <span class="italic">Clarion Call</span>, which he published himself. His memoir of his time in India, &#145;Punjab patrol&#146;, was written in the 1950s, but never published.<br>
