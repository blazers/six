<span class="headword">Ramsay, Sir  Andrew, of Abbotshall and Waughton</span>, first baronet, Lord Abbotshall  (1620?&#150;1688), <span class="occ">provost of Edinburgh</span>, was the third and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23074/', "Andrew Ramsay (1574&#150;1659)")</script>, professor of divinity in the University of Edinburgh and minister of Greyfriars Church, and his wife, Marie Fraser. Bred a merchant, he was admitted a burgess of Edinburgh on 10 August 1642 and a baillie in 1652. He bought the estate of Abbotshall, Fife, from the Scotts of Balwearie, and acquired the estate of Waughton, Haddingtonshire, by marriage to the heir of the Hepburns, whose name is unknown. He assented to the tender of union from the English parliament at Dalkeith in 1652. During Oliver Cromwell's government he was lord provost of Edinburgh from 1654 to 1657 and in 1655 was knighted by Cromwell. He was a member of the second protectorate parliament in 1656, and in 1658 went to London in an attempt to obtain from the protector some relief for the town's burdens.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Ramsay gained the friendship of John Maitland, second earl of Lauderdale, newly appointed secretary of state for Scotland, by prevailing on the city to give &pound;5000 sterling to the government for the superiority of Leith, and another &pound;5000 sterling for the new imposition granted to the town by the king on wine and ale. By ingratiating himself with Lauderdale he secured the favour of the new administration and was again knighted, by Charles II on 17 July 1660. Under Lauderdale's auspices he was again elected lord provost of Edinburgh in 1662 and he kept the chair for twelve successive years, defeating by complicated artifice or open violence any attempt of the council to remove him. He was elected to represent Edinburgh in the convention of estates in 1665 and 1667 and in the parliament from 1669 to 1674. In 1669 he was selected as one of the lords of the articles, and in 1670 he was appointed to the committee for considering union with England. In 1669 he was created a baronet. He was sworn of the privy council in 1671, and was admitted an ordinary lord of session on 23 November 1671, despite having no legal experience. According to Sir George Mackenzie his promotion, with that of three others who like him &#145;had not been bred lawyers&#146;, rendered the court of session &#145;the object of all men's contempt&#146;  (Mackenzie, 240). In recognition of Ramsay's services to the government, Lauderdale prevailed on the king to settle on the provost of Edinburgh &pound;200 a year. In 1667 Ramsay procured from the king a letter ordaining that he as provost should have the same place and precedence as was due to the mayors of London and Dublin, and that no other provost could be called lord provost but he. Following a dispute with the university, at Ramsay's insistence, on 10 November 1667 the town council resolved that the lord provost should also hold the office of rector and governor of the college. By his corrupt and often tyrannical conduct as lord provost, Ramsay lost the support of many of the citizens of the city.<br>
<br>Through his influence in the town council, his presidency of the conventions of royal burghs, and the leading vote among the burghs in parliament, Ramsay was extremely useful to Lauderdale, so much so that the party opposed to Lauderdale resolved to remove him from his office. A motion to supersede him in March 1672 was lost by only two votes. In 1673 articles of impeachment were given in against him by the earl of Eglinton, which alleged that Ramsay had obtained a letter from the king to &#145;thrust Mr Rochead out of his employment as town clerk of Edinburgh without a formal and legal sentence&#146;  (Mackenzie, 262). Lauderdale, fearing recriminations due to his involvement in the ousting of Rochead, prevailed on Ramsay to resign the offices both of provost and of lord of session. In 1685 he was named a commissioner of trade. He died at his house at Abbotshall, Fife, on 17 January 1688. His son Andrew succeeded him in the baronetcy and estates.<br>
