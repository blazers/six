<span class="headword">Oxinden <span class="st"> [Oxenden]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1609&#150;1670), <span class="occ">gentleman and letter-writer</span>, was born on 18 January 1609 at the house of Sir Adam Sprakeling in the parish of St Paul, Canterbury, the eldest son of Richard Oxinden (<i>bap</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. 1629), gentleman, of Great Maydekin in the village of Barham in Kent, and his wife, Katherine Sprakeling (1587&#150;1642) and grandson of Sir Henry Oxinden, knight, of Deane, near Wingham, Kent. He had three younger brothers and two younger sisters. Most of the information about Oxinden's life comes from his surviving correspondence, held in the British Library, the Centre for Kentish Studies in Maidstone, Canterbury Cathedral Archives, and the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, DC. In addition over 200 titles from Oxinden's library survive as the core of the Elham parish library, now housed in Canterbury Cathedral Library. This material provides a rich source for the life of a country squire in seventeenth-century Kent, in particular during the civil war.<br>
<br>Henry Oxinden attended Wye grammar school in Kent. He went to Oxford in 1624, aged fifteen, matriculated at Corpus Christi College on 10 November 1626, and was awarded the BA on 1 February 1627. His studies at Oxford were cut short by the death of his father in 1629, and he returned to Barham to administer the family estates. In June 1632 he was admitted to Gray's Inn. On 28 December of that year he married Anne Peyton (1613&#150;1640), daughter of Sir Samuel Peyton (1590&#150;1623) of Knowlton in Kent; they had a son, Thomas (1633&#150;1668), and two daughters, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1635) and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1636). After Oxinden returned from Oxford he had to settle his brothers and sisters in life. For James (1612&#150;1660), the second eldest, he obtained the living of Goodnestone, near Faversham in Kent. Both Richard (<i>b</i>. 1613) and Adam (1622&#150;1643) were apprenticed to London merchants but neither was happy in trade. In 1641 Richard joined the army, in which he prospered. Both Oxinden sisters were successfully married: Katherine to Thomas Barrow, a London merchant, in 1636, and Elizabeth to James Love of Faversham in 1645.<br>
<br>Oxinden took no part in the stirring events of the 1640s except to serve on the parliamentary side in the siege of Arundel in 1643. The ties of kinship and friendship can clearly be seen to override political differences in his correspondence. He helped both Sir Thomas Peyton and Sir Anthony Percivall, imprisoned as royalists. His uncle Sir James Oxinden and his cousin Henry were prominent in the parliamentary committees running Kent, and with these he kept in close touch throughout the 1640s and 1650s; he also counted as friends Captain John Dixwell, the regicide, and Robert Hales of Howletts. However, his correspondence shows a desire to be left out of the political and military conflict of the time. In June 1642 Oxinden's friend Vincent Denne of Wenderton, near Wingham in Kent, died, leaving his nephew Thomas Denne the younger his main heir, and Oxinden his executor. This was the start of a troublesome and ultimately ruinous relationship between Oxinden and the Denne family. Thomas Denne the elder, father of the heir and recorder of Canterbury, angered by his late brother's dispositions, disowned his son and began a series of legal suits against Oxinden, which were to drain Oxinden's financial resources.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife in 1640, Oxinden married, on 15 September 1642, his young ward, Katherine Culling (1624&#150;1698); they had two daughters, Katherine (1644&#150;1716) and Mary (1648&#150;1674). Two of Oxinden's older children caused him grief in the 1650s. The marriage of his daughter Margaret to John Hobart, in August 1649, involved him in yet more lawsuits, on his new son-in-law's behalf. Thomas, Oxinden's only son, caused him anxiety all through his life, from his poor performance as a scholar to his shameful death. Thomas married Elizabeth Edwards, heir of Nowds in Lynsted, in 1652, when he was nineteen years old and she was fourteen. Elizabeth was sent to live with Oxinden's wife, Katherine, at Barham, and here she formed close relationships with her mother-in-law and with Thomas's two half-sisters, Katherine and Mary. By the time that she reached her majority, in November 1660, the marriage was in difficulties, despite the birth of a son, Richard, in 1655. Thomas seems to have lived a life of dissipation on the fringes of the Restoration court after bouts of soldiering in the 1650s. He fell in with some notorious criminals by the late 1660s, was arrested in June 1668, and was incarcerated in king's bench prison, where he died in December 1668.<br>
<br>In 1647 Oxinden had published the first of his four volumes of verse, all of which were produced at his own expense. <span class="italic">Religionis funus et hypocritae finis</span> included an engraved portrait by Glover and was in two parts: a criticism of contemporary attitudes towards what Oxinden called true religion, and an attack on puritan ministers. It ended with support for Charles I, surprising from one who claimed to be neutral in his views. His <span class="italic">Jobus triumphans</span> (1651) applied Job's story and stoicism to the current troubles, and in 1660 he published both <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, a celebration of Sir Basil Dixwell's marriage, and <span class="italic">Charls Triumphant</span>, in praise of the Restoration. From 1647 Oxinden kept a list in his commonplace book of all the plays in his library. There were 123 in total and they included a remarkable number of early plays, probably not collected by Oxinden himself.<br>
<br>The sale of Great Maydekin in December 1662, for &pound;800 to Edward Ady of Greenwich, and Oxinden's attempts to obtain a living in the church shows the increasingly desperate state of his finances. He was ordained, probably in 1661, by the bishop of Winchester, and in 1663 he was presented to the living of Radnage, near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. He preached there twice in 1664 but never took up residence, citing ill health as the reason. He died of an unknown cause, at the age of sixty-one, and was buried in Denton church on 17 June 1670. Oxinden having died intestate, his library and papers, reflecting his literary and antiquarian interests, were handed down through his daughter Katherine's family. She married the Revd John Warly (1640&#150;1673); their son, John (1673&#150;1732), a physician in Canterbury, and their grandson, Lee Warly (1714&#150;1807), attorney of Canterbury, inherited her estate. Warly died, unmarried, and left the library, which he had greatly augmented, to the parish of Elham in Kent.<br>
