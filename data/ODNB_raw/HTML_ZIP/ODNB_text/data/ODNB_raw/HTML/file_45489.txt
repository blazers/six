<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murrell,  Hilda</span>  (1906&#150;1984), <span class="occ">environmentalist and peace campaigner</span>, was born on 3 February 1906 at Shrewsbury, the elder daughter of Owen Charles Murrell, nurseryman, and his wife, Lily Maria Lowe. She was educated at Shrewsbury High School for Girls (1918&#150;23), winning a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read English and French (1924&#150;7), gaining a 2:1 in both the English tripos and French. She joined the firm of rose growers founded by her father and uncle, and there developed her knowledge of business and of horticulture. In 1943 she became an associate of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. From 1930 to 1970 she was a director, and later the proprietor and sole manager, of the family firm, Portland Nurseries, Shrewsbury, until she sold the business to Percy Thrower. She was an internationally acknowledged authority on rose species, old varieties, and miniature roses, regularly winning gold awards at Chelsea, and her rose catalogues were masterpieces of evocative yet scientifically accurate description. A new (David Austin) rose was named after her, following her death. During and after the Second World War, Hilda Murrell was actively concerned with the care and resettlement of wartime refugees, working with the Jewish Refugee Children's Society. She raised money for the cause by organizing concerts by such artists as Jelly d'Aranyi and Myra Hess and also took immense trouble herself to help desperate individuals.<br>
<br>Hilda Murrell was a devoted hillwalker and fell climber with a special love of both sides of the Welsh marches&#151;&#145;sheer bliss [to] be greeted by perfection&#151;to be able to look <i>over</i> some hill-tops&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hilda Murrell's Nature Diaries</span>, 198), she recorded in her posthumously published <span class="italic">Nature Diaries</span> (1987). In 1962 she became a founder member of the Shropshire Conservation Trust and she also worked vigorously for the Shropshire branch of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. She took a naturalist's interest in the varied habitats in Anglesey and the marches, as attested in her <span class="italic">Nature Diaries</span>, illustrated by her own meticulous botanical line drawings and colour photography. After her retirement in 1970 she built her retreat, The Shack, Maes Uchaf, on a plot of land at Fron Goch, near Llanymynech Hill, Oswestry. The Shack was mysteriously damaged in an arson attack on 26 January 1985.<br>
<br>Increasingly, Hilda Murrell became deeply concerned by the threat of mass extermination posed by the uncontrolled nuclear weapons race and by the irreversible damage to the environment risked by the nuclear power industry. She was a member of the European Nuclear Disarmament Movement founded by E. P. Thompson in 1981, a member of the Shropshire Peace Alliance, a supporter of the women demonstrators against cruise missiles at the American airbase at Greenham Common, a founder member of the nuclear freeze movement in Britain, and, finally, a private researcher seeking to understand and argue against the implications of building another nuclear reactor at Sizewell B in Suffolk. At the age of seventy-eight she completed her paper criticizing the government white paper (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1981&#150;2, Cmnd 8607) on radioactive waste management. The paper was accepted and eventually read to the public inquiry on Sizewell in September 1984.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1984 Hilda Murrell returned home from shopping and was surprised by one or more intruders who had systematically searched her house and papers and disconnected her telephone (in such a way that she could not ring out but anyone ringing in would believe the line was still working). There was a struggle; she was apparently abducted in her own car and driven out 6 miles into the countryside, where she was taken from the car, attacked with a breadknife, and left to die of her wounds and exposure. Three days later her body was discovered. At the end of the century West Mercia police reported that the murder file on Hilda Murrell was still open.<br>
<br>In May 2005, however, a 37-year-old labourer was convicted of murdering Hilda Murell; a resident of a children's home at the time of the murder, he had killed her during the course of a burglary. Until then there had been composite and conflicting theories, including both conspiracy and incompetence, for her terrible end. The most anodyne explanation, that a little old lady had been surprised by a burglar who panicked, though it turned out to be largely correct, was questioned because Hilda Murrell was no ordinary little old lady. She had told several people before her death that she had fears for her personal safety. Two possible motives emerged for the systematic search of her house&#151;a wish to check out her case against Sizewell B and/or a wish to find any possibly &#145;sensitive&#146; documents concerning the Falklands War that might have been left in her safe keeping by her nephew Commander Rob Green (though Green, who had resigned from the navy after the Falklands War, categorically denied having left naval documents of any kind with his aunt).<br>
<br>Hilda Murrell's murder roused intense speculation in the press, as well as many attempts to pay her adequate tribute. A fictional variation on her character, her beliefs, and her fate is detectable in Maggie Gee's eponymous <span class="italic">Grace</span> (1988). Also in 1988 a &#145;Summer forum to celebrate the countryside interests of Hilda Murrell&#146; was inaugurated in Shropshire, and was held there every June until the tenth anniversary of her death.<br>
<br>Shy, tough-minded, humorous, kind, and possessing an exceptional responsiveness to nature, Hilda Murrell was enjoyed and admired by her friends for her many gifts, for her intellectual and moral courage, and for her refusal to be handicapped either by her arthritis or by the fact that she had lost the use of her right eye in infancy. Her life as a rose grower, plantswoman, writer, and environmental activist was a constructive and creative one; she deserves to be remembered for that life quite apart from the longstanding mystery of its brutal end. Her ashes were scattered on 25 August 1984 near the standing stone in Bwlch Maengwynedd&#151;the open roof of Wales.<br>
