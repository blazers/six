<span class="headword">Fitzgerald <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grey]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, countess of Kildare  (<em>fl. </em>1514&#150;1548), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was a younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11560/', "Thomas Grey, first marquess of Dorset (c.1455&#150;1501)")</script>, and his second wife, Cicely Bonville, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Harington and Bonville (<i>d</i>. 1530). Little is known about her early life. She attended Mary, Henry VIII's sister and wife of Louis XII, in France in 1514. Thereafter, as Henry VIII's second cousin, she acquired considerable experience of the Tudor court. At a banquet for Mary, now the dowager queen of France and married to Charles Brandon, at Greenwich in July 1517 she had a place of honour, and ten days later she acted as deputy for the Princess Mary at the baptism of the Brandons' daughter. She also participated, as one of Queen Catherine's retinue, in the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520.<br>
<br>About 1522 Elizabeth married as his second wife <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534)")</script>. The marriage was a means whereby the earl rebuilt his credit at court after a period out of favour, and Lady Elizabeth's mother and four brothers had all put up bonds for Kildare's appearance before the king in 1521. Subsequently, through the mediation of Cardinal Wolsey, the dowager marchioness had reached agreement with her son Thomas, second marquess, for a marriage portion of &pound;1000 for the Lady Elizabeth and her three sisters. The countess returned to Ireland with her husband early in 1523 and immediately exerted her influence at court to support Kildare's position in Ireland. Writing from Maynooth in May, she sent Wolsey a partial but shrewd analysis of recent developments in her husband's feud with the earl of Ormond, while urging Wolsey to favour Kildare's suits at her instance and thanking him for reminding her mother concerning her marriage money: &#145;for as yet my sayd lord and husband hat not had enny gret proffyt by me, yet I find hym as good and kynd unto me alwes, as eny man may be to hys wyf&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.101). On another occasion she asked the earl of Shrewsbury to ignore false reports that Kildare was oppressing his tenants and usurping his privileges in Shrewsbury's liberty of Wexford. Kildare also began to use his wife's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11551/', "Lord Leonard Grey")</script>, as an intermediary with the king and Wolsey. In 1531 Kildare secured a private act of parliament assuring his countess an annual income of Ir&pound;200 for life from his estates, with a clause allowing her possession of the manor of Portlester after his death if she chose to live in Ireland.<br>
<br>By 1533, with her husband now seriously ill from a bullet wound, the countess was increasingly concerned to ensure provision for her young sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald (1525&#150;1585)")</script> and Edward. Pointing out that Kildare had already provided for his heir and other children by his first wife, she petitioned the king for a 61-year lease for herself and Gerald of five royal manors in Meath, and she also approached Cromwell, asking Lord Leonard to have Cromwell &#145;labor this as secretely as ye can&#146; because the earl &#145;wold be mor gladder to get these manors unto his eldest son&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 60/2, fol. 3). None the less, when the king sent for Kildare, the earl entrusted his wife with the delicate mission of conveying his excuses on grounds of illness. She reached court in early October 1533, but the king insisted on Kildare's personal appearance. Following his arrival and subsequent imprisonment in July 1534, Lady Kildare was initially prevented from visiting him, but as he lay dying she was allowed to visit freely. Her absence in England cleared her of any suspicion of involvement in the Kildare rebellion, but when Lord Leonard was sent to Ireland as marshal of the army (July 1535) and, later, governor (January 1536) she was thought to have great influence with her brother. Rumours in late 1535 that she intended to return to Ireland drew a warning to Cromwell from an old adversary of the earl that this could do no good.<br>
<br>After her husband's death the countess lived quietly at Beaumanor, Leicestershire. She was associated with Princess Mary's household and with the conservative faction plotting against Anne Boleyn. The king eventually honoured her dower, despite the earl's posthumous attainder in 1536, and she received quarterly payments of 50 marks sterling even though the Irish revenues were sometimes overassigned. Her sons evaded Lord Leonard's arrest of Kildare's brothers in February 1536, probably with his collusion, and in July, as she notified Cromwell, Edward, then aged eight, was mysteriously deposited at Beaumanor during her absence. She was allowed to raise him. The elder son, Gerald, initially took refuge in the Irishry, later fleeing to the continent; but Irish officials believed she could have assisted in his capture. Following Henry VIII's death, the regime of Protector Somerset was more favourable to the restoration of fallen magnates and, with the privy council's encouragement, the countess wrote to her son, then in Italy, in January 1548. Observing that she had &#145;taken such care of you as never mother tooke greater for her childe&#146;, she undertook to get him his pardon if he would repent and submit, which would be &#145;to me an ende of muche care and sorowe&#146;, and suggested that the king might grant him an honourable living,  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1547&#150;50</i>, 540&#150;42). He returned to England during the spring, conducted home by Lady Kildare's chaplain. In 1554, he was at last created eleventh earl of Kildare, but whether his mother lived to witness this is unclear.<br>
