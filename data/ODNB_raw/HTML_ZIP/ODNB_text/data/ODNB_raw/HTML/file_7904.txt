<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  James Dawes</span>  (1785&#150;1862), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 14 January 1785, the elder son of Major James Sholto Douglas of Grange in Jamaica (first cousin of the fifth and sixth marquesses of Queensberry) and Sarah, daughter of James Dawes. He was commissioned ensign in the 42nd regiment (Black Watch) and was at once taken on the staff of Major-General Sir James Duff, commanding at Limerick, where he became a close friend of his fellow aide-de-camp, William Napier, the military historian. In 1801 he was promoted lieutenant and joined the Royal Military College at Great Marlow. He was promoted captain in 1804, and, being pronounced fit for staff duty, was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general with the force sent to South America in 1806. He was praised in dispatches, and in 1807 was nominated in the same capacity to the corps proceeding to Portugal under Sir Arthur Wellesley, and was present at the battles of Roli&ccedil;a and Vimeiro. He advanced into Spain with Sir John Moore, and served with the 2nd division through the disastrous retreat from Salamanca and at the battle of Corunna.<br>
<br>When Beresford was sent to Portugal in 1809 to organize the Portuguese army, Douglas accompanied him; he was in February 1809 promoted major in the English army and appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 8th Portuguese regiment. He soon got his regiment fit for service, and was present at the brilliant passage of the Douro in May 1809; at the end of the year his regiment was attached to Picton's, the 3rd division, and brigaded with the 88th and 45th regiments. At the battle of Busaco this brigade had to bear the brunt of the French attack, and Douglas's Portuguese were praised for their conduct, which was specially mentioned in Lord Wellington's dispatch.<br>
<br>Douglas commanded this regiment all through the campaign of 1811, and in 1812, when the Portuguese were considered sufficiently disciplined to be brigaded alone, it formed part of Pack's Portuguese brigade. This was the brigade which distinguished itself at the battle of Salamanca by its gallant though vain attempt to carry the hill of the Arapiles, and Douglas was again mentioned in dispatches. At the beginning of 1813 Major-General Pack was removed to the command of a British brigade, and Douglas, who had been promoted lieutenant-colonel in May 1811, succeeded him in the 7th Portuguese brigade, part of Sir John Hamilton's Portuguese division. At the head of this brigade he distinguished himself at the battles of the Pyrenees, where he was wounded, of the Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez and Toulouse, where he was twice severely wounded and lost a leg (for which he received a pension of &pound;350 per annum). At the conclusion of the war he received a gold cross and three clasps for the battles in which he had been engaged with a regiment or brigade, and was made knight of the Tower and Sword (Portugal) and KCB (January 1815). In 1815 Douglas married Marianne, daughter of William Bullock of Jamaica, and they had eleven children; she predeceased him.<br>
<br>Douglas was deputy quartermaster-general in Scotland (1815&#150;22) and in Ireland (1825&#150;30). He was promoted colonel in 1819 and major-general in 1830, when he received the command of the south-western district of Ireland. From 1837 to 1842 he was lieutenant-governor of Guernsey. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1838, and was made a GCB in May 1860. He had been made colonel of the 93rd foot in 1840 and of the 42nd highlanders in 1850, and was promoted general in 1854. After leaving Guernsey he retired to Clifton, Bristol, where he died at his residence, 25 Royal York Crescent, on 6 March 1862.<br>
