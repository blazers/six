<span class="headword">Blagge,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1522), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born on an undetermined date, at Northwich, Cheshire (as stated in his will), the son of Stephen Blagge and his wife, Alice. His early life and career are obscure. He received his training in the law at the Inner Temple, where he was a governor in 1511, and served as clerk to John Fitzherbert, who was king's remembrancer of the exchequer from 1480 to 1502. Following Fitzherbert's death Blagge was, on 16 December 1502, granted for life the office of king's remembrancer; he was admitted on 26 January 1503. The king's remembrancer, invariably a prominent lawyer, supervised a department of the exchequer of audit responsible for auditing royal accounts and collecting crown debts. Blagge became the first remembrancer since 1447 to be raised to the exchequer bench, as third baron, on 27 June 1511. Unlike his predecessors, Blagge was permitted to retain the remembrancer's office, to be exercised by deputy, in a confirmation by letters patent. Subsequently, on 19 November 1515, Blagge secured a new life grant of the remembrancership in reversion for his son Barnabe. However, on Blagge's death in 1522 the office passed to a keeper, John Copewood, and in 1524 the patent of 1515 was declared void on the grounds that Blagge possessed no legal estate in the remembrancership from the date of his elevation to the bench. His successor, Thomas Walsh, surrendered the office upon being appointed fourth baron in 1534.<br>
<br>In 1515 Blagge moved to the centre of royal financial administration with his appointment as surveyor of crown lands alongside Sir Edward Belknap and Bartholomew Westby. He remained active in this office until the year of his death. As a surveyor and a general purveyor of the king's revenue, Blagge proved to be a resourceful and hard-headed administrator. Shortly before his death he was involved in collecting the fines for distraint of knighthood. He also held numerous appointments in local government, being on successive commissions of the peace for Kent and Middlesex, and commissions of sewers for Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Essex, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Blagge acquired a landed estate in Somerset, Wiltshire, Middlesex, and Kent, which was to be divided upon his death between Barnabe, of the Inner Temple, his only living child with his first wife, Katherine, the daughter and heir of Thomas Brown (or Brune) of Kent; and George (1512/13&#150;1551), his only living child from his marriage of 1506 to his second wife, Mary, daughter of John Brooke, seventh Lord Cobham (<i>d</i>. 1512), and Margaret, daughter of Edward Neville, Lord Bergavenny. George would receive the larger portion, including estates that came to his father from his second marriage. At the age of twenty-one George was to inherit property in Holloway, Middlesex, and Bristol, and the manors of Severswoke and Grubbswyk, Somerset; at the death of his mother he was to have the manors of Lucton, Barrers, and Broke Montacute, Somerset, and several tenements in Dartford, Kent. George Blagge esquire, of Westminster and Dartford, later became a courtier to Henry VIII and Edward VI, a comptroller of London customs, MP for Bedford and Westminster, and a prominent protestant associate of Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder. He was knighted during the Scottish campaign of 1547. In his will of 8 September 1522 Robert Blagge required that George marry his ward, Mary Coke, if his son consented upon coming of age, but in the event George married Dorothy, daughter of William Badby of Essex; they had three children, including the Elizabethan MP Henry Blagge (<i>d</i>. 1596). Barnabe Blagge received a life interest from his father of lands in Dartford, Wilmington, Sutton, and Darenth, Kent, which had in part been his mother's dowry; an inheritance of his father's property in Westminster; and &pound;106 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in money and plate. He died without heirs; the date of his death is not known. An elder son from Robert Blagge's first marriage, Robert, of the Inner Temple, predeceased his father.<br>
<br>Robert Blagge died on 13 September 1522 in London and was buried shortly afterwards in the priory of St Bartholomew beside his first wife. Mary Blagge was executor to his estate; the overseers were his close friends Sir Richard Broke (<i>d</i>. 1529), serjeant-at-law, recorder of the city of London, and MP for London, and Nicholas Mynne of London, royal auditor. He left a bequest to his brother-in-law, Thomas Pymme, of Middlesex, foreign apposer of the exchequer (1515&#150;49). His last will and testament revealed a devout character, intent upon deeds of late medieval piety and charity. Blagge was a not untypical lawyer of the opening decades of the sixteenth century who through advantageous marriages and government service rose to a position of influence and socio-economic success.<br>
