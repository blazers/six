<span class="headword">Whitney,  Isabella</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1566&#150;1573), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is assumed to be the daughter of Geoffrey Whitney of Coole Pilate, Cheshire, and the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29320/', "Geoffrey Whitney (1548?&#150;1600/01)")</script>, author of a minor emblem book, <span class="italic">A Choice of Emblemes</span> (1586), on the basis of correspondences between persons named in the younger Geoffrey's will and in his volume of emblems, with persons named in <span class="italic">A Sweet Nosgay</span>, Isabella's second volume of verses. It is possible that references in <span class="italic">Nosgay</span> to Geoffrey Whitney refer to two other, more distantly connected, contemporary Geoffrey Whitneys; Isabella's own statement was that she was &#145;bred&#146; in London. If she was the sister of the author Geoffrey Whitney, she was either estranged from Geoffrey, or married (the &#145;Sister Eldershae&#146; he names), or dead by September 1600, when Geoffrey omitted mention of an Isabella in his will. Her mother's surname may have been Cartwright. Whatever her origins, Isabella Whitney enjoys the distinction of being the first woman under whose name, or initials, a complete, printed volume of original, secular poetry appeared in English.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Copy of a Letter</span> (1566&#150;7), the first of Whitney's two known miscellanies, survives in only one known exemplar housed at the Bodleian Library. In addition to a prefatory poem by Richard Jones, the printer, the volume contains four jaunty love complaints, two in female and two in male voice. Although some critics have argued that Whitney was author of only two of the poems, &#145;I.W. To her Unconstant Lover&#146; and &#145;The Admonition by the Auctor&#146;, others&#151;Marquis and Krontiris, most notably&#151;claim that the juxtaposed poems privilege a female complaint about the misuse of women over a male complaint about rebellious women. There have been unreliable editions of <span class="italic">Copy</span> by J. P. Collier (<span class="italic">Illustrations of Early English Popular Literature</span>, 1863) and E. Arber (<span class="italic">An English Garner</span>, 1896); a portion was reproduced by Travitsky in 1980, and a facsimile of the whole was published (with an introduction by Panofsky) in 1982.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Sweet Nosgay</span> (1573), Whitney's second, more complex miscellany, is extant in an imperfect exemplar held at the British Library. The title poem reworks some of the adages of Hugh Plat's <span class="italic">Floures of Philosophie</span> (1572), particularly those on love and friendship, flavouring some of the verses with added point of a type that might be called proto-feminist. Like <span class="italic">Copy</span>, <span class="italic">Nosgay</span> can be read as focusing on a single motif, in this case the suffering and illness (mitigated somewhat by the love and friendship of family and friends) which eventually caused the author to leave &#145;good London&#146;. Poetic epistles and other verses to family and friends describe both the addressees and Whitney's situation, thereby relaying to us seemingly autobiographical titbits that state or suggest that she is from a large family; that two of her younger sisters, to whom she proffers advice, are in service; that she is single and therefore free to write verses; that she is of gentle&#151;though not exalted&#151;rank; and that although she has been in service to a woman she admires, she is luckless: she has been ill, has lost her position, and is financially hard-pressed. In the final, most original, and most important poem in the volume, the mock &#145;Wyll and Testament&#146; Whitney addresses to London before her departure (and her anticipated, mock-serious demise), Whitney describes the city in vivid detail reminiscent of the character sketches of &#145;Cock Lorell's Boat&#146;, of the rogue tracts and cony-catching pamphlets, and of the later city comedies. &#145;Wyll&#146;, though similar to earlier mock testaments, is unusual in being fitted into a narrative frame; Gascoigne may have written his &#145;Last Will and Testament of Dan Bartholomew of Bath&#146; in imitation. In addition to Panofsky's facsimile of the entire <span class="italic">Nosgay</span> (1982), parts of the volume were published in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Both volumes mark Whitney as a very unconventional woman. Earlier Englishwomen who put works in print were noble or associated with court circles, and their pious productions (usually translated) were both inherently blameless and a plausible excuse for their breach of convention. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that Whitney was well connected, and her poems give what Beilin has termed &#145;public&#146; voice to breezily expressed secular concerns. Her jocose tone, in fact, lends credence to the suggestion that she is writing imaginary, rather than heartfelt, laments (as her publisher suggests in his prefatory poem to <span class="italic">Copy</span>). Whitney was certainly <i>au courant</i> with London literary trends; in fact, she can be viewed as a trend-setter for her composition both of rhymed epistles and of a mock testament. The ballad measure which she used frequently was very popular; her use of familiar allusions (including many of her titles) and of exaggerated complaints are consonant with &#145;the native plain style of poetry&#146; of her time; she is indeed similar&#151;in all but gender&#151;to contemporaries like Gascoigne, Googe, and Turberville. As a woman writer of such verses, however, she is absolutely unique in the mid-sixteenth century: the &#145;Judith Shakespeare&#146; whom Virginia Woolf posited as an impossibility.<br>
<br>Both of Whitney's complete volumes were printed by Richard Jones, who specialized in popular ephemera. Fehrenbach speculates that &#145;The Complaint of a Woman Lover&#146;, printed by Jones in <span class="italic">A Handefull of Pleasant Delites</span> (1566?), may have been Whitney's and that Jones may have printed two other poems by Whitney, &#145;The Lady Beloved Exclaymeth of the Great Untruth of her Lover&#146; and &#145;The Lamentacion of a Gentilwoman upon the Death of her Late Deceased Frend William Gruffith Gent.&#146; in <span class="italic">A Gorgious Gallery, of Gallant Inventions</span> (1578). Green suggested that Whitney might also have been author of &#145;Another by I.W.&#146;, a prefatory poem in Thomas Morley's <span class="italic">A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke</span> (1597), although this work was not printed by Jones. There is, however, nothing concrete to tie any of these poems to Whitney.<br>
