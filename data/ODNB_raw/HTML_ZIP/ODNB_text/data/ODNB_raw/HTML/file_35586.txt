<span class="headword">Poulton, Sir  Edward Bagnall</span>  (1856&#150;1943), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born at Reading on 27 January 1856, the second child and only son of William Ford Poulton, architect, and his wife, Georgina Selina Bagnall. From a young age he showed a keen interest in natural history, and especially in entomology. However, such interests were not encouraged at Oakley House, Reading, and school was &#145;a long dreary interval in a happy life&#146;  (Carpenter, 665). In addition, his father wished him to become an architect, and only reluctantly allowed him to study science. In 1873 Poulton won a scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, where he was placed in the first class in natural science in 1876 and where he was president of the union in 1879.<br>
<br>In 1876 Poulton became a demonstrator in comparative anatomy under George Rolleston, whose brilliant lectures had greatly inspired him. However, the inadequacy of his salary led to him to accept the Burdett-Coutts scholarship in geology in 1878&#151;as a result of which he worked for a time under Joseph Prestwich. Thus it came about that his first published researches, in 1880, were on Tertiary remains in a Yorkshire cave. However, geology was not a passion, and he returned to zoology later in 1880 with an appointment as lecturer at Jesus and Keble colleges. The following year he married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1939), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21184/', "George Palmer")</script>, biscuit manufacturer and Liberal member of parliament for Reading; they had two sons and three daughters. Poulton quickly attracted attention at Oxford by morphological studies on the tongues of marsupials and by discovering in the embryos of the duck-billed platypus (<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>) the rudiments of teeth. His last work on vertebrate zoology, in 1894, was a paper on the bill and hairs of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, with a discussion of the homologies and origin of mammalian hair.<br>
<br>Poulton's first entomological paper appeared in 1884&#151;on his favourite subject, the colours, markings, and protective attitudes of caterpillars. His interest in this was stimulated by finding that some observations he had made as a boy were in accord with the studies of August Weismann. Throughout his life he emphasized the need for observation of the living insect, especially its behaviour. He wrote a series of papers on insects that alter their coloration to camouflage themselves. Essays by A. R. Wallace turned his attention to the importance of protective colouring in all its forms, concealing, warning, and mimetic, and this is the subject of which he became the foremost exponent.<br>
<br>As a student Poulton had been warned off Darwinism by John Obadiah Westwood, leading entomologist and first Hope professor of zoology at Oxford, because it was too speculative. But under the inspiration of Wallace and Weismann, Poulton made the study of evolution more rigorous by using both careful fieldwork and experiments to analyse adaptation. These methods advanced a newer ecological approach to the study of evolution. Poulton argued for the importance of natural selection as the main mechanism of evolution and, like Weismann, attacked the neo-Lamarckian theory that acquired characteristics could be inherited. He publicized Weismann's work, helping to arrange the publication of <span class="italic">Essays upon Heredity and Kindred Biological Subjects</span> (1889), translated from Weismann's original text. In 1890 Poulton produced <span class="italic">The Colours of Animals</span>, which concisely and simply explained the many forms of coloration in terms of natural selection; these forms he ingeniously summarized in a comparative table introducing terms which became the standard nomenclature.<br>
<br>The Royal Society elected Poulton a fellow in 1889, and in 1893 he was appointed Hope professor of zoology at Oxford. Over the next forty years he corresponded with many naturalists who, stimulated by his enthusiasm, sent to Oxford the large collections which greatly aided him in the study of warning colours and mimicry, especially in tropical Africa.<br>
<br>While Poulton always emphasized the need for observation and experiment in the field, he often found it possible to make important deductions from museum specimens. His explanation of the extraordinary differences, found in African <i>Precis</i> butterflies, between the forms occurring in wet or dry seasons was a good example of his careful work. He showed that the form appearing in the dry season, the period of greatest danger to the individual insect, while better concealed than the wet season form, could be seen to be derived from it if the minute details of pattern were carefully traced. Such seasonal forms had hitherto been classed as distinct species, until Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall, in 1898, bred one from the other. Poulton's self-revealing comment on this was:<blockquote>Under the shock of Mr. Marshall's discovery &hellip; the systematist may well feel doubts about the foundations upon which his science has been erected. In these distracting circumstances a firm belief in natural selection will be found to exercise a wonderfully calming and steadying influence. (Cited in Carpenter, 668)</blockquote>Poulton also became deeply interested in the study of the wide variations of African mimetic butterflies collected in localities where the species mimicked were much less common than the mimickers. He put forward the suggestion that natural selection was here in abeyance. Mimicry is not maintained in the absence of the models because there is no greater selective pressure upon one variant than upon another. It was a bionomic discovery that gave Poulton great pleasure. As a Darwinian he was greatly interested in sexual selection, and under his influence much knowledge was gained of the courtship of insects and of the special structures used for that purpose.<br>
<br>After 1900 two new theories, the mutation theory of Hugo de Vries and Mendelian theory, appeared to challenge the Darwinian idea of origin of species by selection of small variations. Poulton disagreed vehemently with the way the proponents of these new theories disparaged traditional lines of research in natural history. He argued that Mendelism merely extended ideas advanced by Weismann, and hence was not an abrupt departure from Darwinism. His critique of the limitations of the new science was published as an introduction to his collection of papers, <span class="italic">Essays on Evolution, 1889&#150;1907</span> (1908). Starting in 1913 Poulton began a debate with Reginald C. Punnett, who used Mendelian theory to explain mimicry. Poulton emphasized the compatibility between Darwinism and Mendelism. His work on mimicry influenced Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a founder of theoretical population genetics. Fisher developed the ecological genetics of mimicry in collaboration with Edmund B. Ford, who had been Poulton's student in the 1920s.<br>
<br>Wide recognition came to Poulton as a leader. He was a vice-president of the Royal Society for 1909&#150;10 and its Darwin medallist in 1914. He presided over the Linnean Society of London from 1912 to 1916 and was awarded the Linnean medal in 1922. He was three times president of the Entomological Society of London, which elected him honorary life president in 1933 when the title &#145;Royal&#146; was conferred upon it. The second International Congress of Entomology met under his guidance in 1912, as did the Association of Economic (later Applied) Biologists in 1922&#150;3. He was for many years a member of the British Association, and he presided over it in 1937, having been president of the zoology section in 1931. He was a commander of the Swedish order of the Pole Star, and an honorary member of many foreign learned societies. The universities of Reading, Durham, Dublin, and Princeton conferred honorary degrees upon him; he was knighted in 1935. He died at his home, Wykeham House, 56 Banbury Road, Oxford, on 20 November 1943. The only child to survive him was his second daughter. The elder son, Edward Palmer Poulton, a distinguished physician, was on the staff of Guy's Hospital. The younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64580/', "Ronald William Poulton")</script>, who took the name Poulton-Palmer, was a famous rugby football blue and international; he was killed in action in the First World War.<br>
