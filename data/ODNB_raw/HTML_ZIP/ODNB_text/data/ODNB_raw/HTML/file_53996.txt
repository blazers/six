<span class="headword">Fairbank family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1725&#150;1848), <span class="occ">surveyors</span>, were of a family settled in Sheffield since the second half of the sixteenth century. The family surveying tradition began with <a name="cosubject_53994"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Fairbank</span>  (<em>c.</em>1688&#150;1759), <span class="occ">surveyor and schoolmaster</span>, born in Sheffield about 1688. It was quite common to practise these two professions as both demanded similar skills, although once a surveyor became well established and busy it could prove difficult to remain in the field, surveying for days at a stretch, without jeopardizing the running of a school. The family were Quakers from about the end of the seventeenth century. William married Emma (<i>d</i>. 1756), widow of William Broadhead of Sheffield and daughter of John Clark of Swinton, near Rotherham, on 9 December 1725 at the Friends' meeting-house in Sheffield; they had three sons and two daughters. He was a committed Quaker, being appointed representative at a meeting of Friends in 1733 and that year having his goods distrained for non-payment of tithes. He left maps and plans dated 1737 to 1750, but the surviving maps are a tiny proportion of the many plans his daybooks show him to have drawn. He also kept a school in Sheffield, possibly at White House, Bramall Lane, at least from 1753 until his death, which occurred at a roadside inn outside Sheffield on 5 December 1759 as a result of a riding accident the previous day; he was buried in the Quaker burial-ground in Sheffield. His youngest son, <a name="cosubject_45592"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Fairbank</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1801), followed him as both <span class="occ">surveyor and schoolmaster</span>. He married Mary, daughter of Josiah Forster, surveyor and schoolmaster, of Tottenham High Cross, Middlesex, at the Tottenham Friends' meeting-house on 11 May 1758. He combined his two professions until demand for his services as a surveyor led him to give up the school in 1774. He did much surveying for the town trustees and for private landowners, as well as laying out and constructing many turnpike roads in and around Sheffield. He also did engineering works on the River Don and other waterways, and laid out and built many public and private buildings. The family surveys of Sheffield were so numerous that he was able to publish a street map of the town in 1771 and revise and extend it in 1801. He died on 9 August 1801 at his home at West Hill, Lee's Croft, Sheffield; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>William [ii] Fairbank had three sons and two daughters, and his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_57746"></a><span class="headword">William [iii] Fairbank</span>  (<em>c.</em>1771&#150;1846), and his second son, <a name="cosubject_53996"></a><span class="headword">Josiah Fairbank</span>  (1777&#150;1844), both of whom had been helping their father in the business, formed a partnership after his death. In 1808 they published a revised map of Sheffield, then growing rapidly. William [iii] was never very active in the family firm and long before he died, unmarried, at Sheffield on 15 July 1846 his brother Josiah took sole control and moved the business to East Parade, Sheffield, from where he valued the whole of Sheffield and Halifax for rating purposes, built roads, and constructed reservoirs, as well as continuing with private estate mapping. He married Sarah Carbutt (1783&#150;1853) of Leeds and they had seven sons and four daughters. Josiah left the Society of Friends shortly before his death on 23 April 1844 in Sheffield. He was buried in Sheffield general cemetery. Three of his sons became surveyors in the business and of these <a name="cosubject_53997"></a><span class="headword">William Fairbank Fairbank</span>  (1805&#150;1848) became his father's partner. He married Frances Royston Fisher. He inherited much parliamentary work from his father&#151;some road projects, but mainly railway schemes. The pressure of work in the railway mania and its subsequent collapse in 1844&#150;5 led to his suffering a stroke in 1846 after which he worked only from his office, not in the field, and on 29 May 1848 he had a second, fatal, stroke while in his garden at South Street, Sheffield. He was buried at Ecclesall; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>The death of William Fairbank Fairbank brought the Sheffield surveying family to a close, although his brothers Josiah Forster Fairbank (<i>d</i>. 1899)&#151;who had been in the family firm until the railway collapse of the 1840s&#151;and John Tertius Fairbank, and other descendants, continued surveying outside Sheffield. The several thousand maps, plans, drawings, and elevations in the Fairbank collection are particularly valuable for those involved in legal disputes over rights of way and boundaries, and for students of the geography and history of Sheffield and the surrounding area, since the large-scale plans and their careful annotations provide evidence of local landownership and landholding over a very considerable period. The collection includes the first known maps of many localities and the field and account books also shed light on the daily routine and livelihood of the family as surveyors, schoolmasters, and building contractors.<br>
