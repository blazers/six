<span class="headword">Dodwell,  William</span>  (1709&#150;1785), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born at Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, on 17 June 1709, the second son and fifth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7763/', "Henry Dodwell (1641&#150;1711)")</script>, Jacobite and nonjuror, and his wife, Anne Elliot (<i>d</i>. 1750). His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7764/', "Henry Dodwell (1706&#150;1784)")</script>, religious controversialist. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 23 March 1726 and proceeded BA in 1729 and MA in 1732. On 27 November 1740, at Bray church, he married Elizabeth Brown (<i>b</i>. 1712), who was probably the daughter of the Revd Thomas Brown, vicar of Bray, and Elizabeth, his wife. Dodwell took holy orders and, thanks to the patronage of the resident squire, Arthur Vansittart, became rector of Shottesbrooke, vicar of White Waltham in 1742, and vicar of Bucklesbury in 1749. Other preferment followed, due in the first instance to Dodwell's polemical skills rather than the pastoral gifts that he also possessed, perhaps in smaller measure. Thomas Sherlock, while bishop of Salisbury, awarded him the prebendal stall of Grantham Australis in Salisbury Cathedral in 1748 (collated 5 October) and he was subsequently given a residentiary canonry there (collated 2 November 1754). In 1763 (collated 25 October) Sherlock's successor, John Thomas, made Dodwell archdeacon of Berkshire&#151;an inspired choice, since he took seriously the need for the clergy to pursue lives of practical holiness, a concern reflected in his <span class="italic">Practical Discourses on Moral Subjects</span> (2 vols., 1748&#150;9).<br>
<br>Dodwell was one of the staunchest defenders of orthodoxy produced by the Church of England in the eighteenth century. Unsurprisingly, given his background, his position was high-church in essentials but moderate withal; he took care to distance himself from both the Jacobitism and the deism that had characterized his father and brother Henry respectively. Dodwell had no doubt that faith was the highest good and comfort available to mankind. His own position was well articulated in <span class="italic">Two sermons on 1 Peter iii. 15 on the nature, procedure, and effects of a rational faith, preached before the University of Oxford, 11 March and 24 June 1744</span> (1745); in reply to his brother's <span class="italic">Christianity not Founded on Argument</span> he emphasized that &#145;The Fundamentals of Christianity are on all sides acknowledged to be few, plain and easy&#146;  (p. 69). But this was by no means a non-dogmatic version of Anglicanism. <span class="italic">The Practical Influence of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity Represented</span> (1745), preached at St Mary's, Oxford, before the university, criticized those believers who had &#145;given up all the distinguishing Articles of Revealed [religion], in compliance with the professed advocates of natural religion&#146;  (p. 28). This could not be justified when trinitarianism was &#145;the very essence of the Christian Religion, the foundation of the whole Revelation, and connected with every part of it&#146;  (p. 19). Dodwell expounded his position in <span class="italic">Three Charges on the Athanasian Creed</span>, originally delivered to the Berkshire clergy but not published until 1802.<br>
<br>Dodwell was punctilious in defending the apostolic deposit of faith against all those who would modify, abridge, or deny it. In <span class="italic">The desirableness of the Christian faith illustrated and applied: a sermon preached at the triennial visitation of the Rt Rev Father in God Thomas, lord bishop of Sarum, held at Reading, 30 August 1744</span> (1744) he deplored the growth in number of &#145;speculative infidels&#146;  (p. 2) and insisted that &#145;an infidel in calamity is the most miserable creature, that imagination can paint&#146;  (p. 18). Bolingbroke was a particular target in <span class="italic">The Doctrine of a Particular Providence Stated, Confirmed, Defended and Applied in Two Sermons</span> (1760), a topic of central importance for contemporary defenders of Christianity. Dodwell directed most of his polemical energies against those whom he saw as distorting the faith, among them Conyers Middleton, William Romaine, and William Whiston. In <span class="italic">A free answer to Dr Middleton's free inquiry into the miraculous powers of the primitive church</span> (1749), he defended the church fathers and contested each of Middleton's four main criticisms of the primitive church and its use of miracles; there were occasions, he insisted, when they could be convincingly vindicated &#145;to the satisfaction of men of sense&#146;  (p. 21). He queried Romaine's grasp of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in <span class="italic">Dissertation on Jephthah's Vow, Occasioned by Rev. William Romaine's Sermon on the Subject</span> (1745), and in <span class="italic">The eternity of future punishment asserted and vindicated: two sermons preached before the University of Oxford on Sunday, 21 Mar 1741</span> (1743) he attacked what he believed was Whiston's blatantly heretical theology, suggesting that:<blockquote>these Attempts to distinguish away the Sense of the most vital parts of our religion, by Those, who in profession are friends to the authority of it, are rather more prejudicial than the open attacks of those, who more consistently reject the whole. (preface)</blockquote>If Dodwell was never the most feared spokesman for theological correctness, neither was his reputation tainted by a tendency to acerbity or an insistence on having the last word on any matter. His linguistic skills and his familiarity with the primary documents of the Church of England (including patristic authorities and the Caroline divines) made him also something of a liturgist. His <span class="italic">The sick man's companion, or, The clergyman's assistant in visiting the sick, with a dissertation on prayer</span> (1767) is a remarkable series of prayers, inspired by the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, for all sorts of afflicted men and women, such as &#145;for one that is recovered/under a relapse&#146;, &#145;one that wants sleep&#146;, &#145;prisoners before or after trial&#146;. This work, like the rest of Dodwell's output, reflected his satisfaction with his confession's primitive character. In <span class="italic">A charge delivered to the clergy of the archdeaconry of Berks. at the late visitation, in May 1764</span> (1764) he returned to his favourite theme of the early church, insisting that the protestant religion was as old as the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>: &#145;All the primitive Churches in the world were of our religion&#146;  (p. 27). It was wholly appropriate that the degree of DD, by diploma, was conferred on him by the University of Oxford, on 23 February 1750.<br>
<br>Dodwell wrote copiously and published a large number of sermons in addition to those already discussed. He also published <span class="italic">Letter to the Author of Considerations on the Act to Prevent Clandestine Marriages</span>, with a postscript prompted by Stebbing's <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Annulling Clauses in London</span> (1755). He died on 23 October 1785, leaving a large family, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral, where there is a monumental inscription composed by his old friend Bishop Charles Moss.<br>
