<span class="headword">Perry,  Percival Lee Dewhurst</span>, Baron Perry  (1878&#150;1956), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 18 March 1878, at Bristol, the third son of Alfred Thomas Perry, clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Revd Henry Wheeler. He won a scholarship to King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham, which he attended from 1889 to 1894. His earliest jobs were in a bicycle shop and a solicitor's office, but his hope of studying law was frustrated by lack of funds. At the age of seventeen he sold his stamp collection to pay for a rail ticket to London, where he was employed by the motoring pioneer Harry Lawson. He married in 1902 Catherine, daughter of John Meals, postmaster, of Hull. They were childless.<br>
<br>In 1903 Perry was commissioned to write a technical report on the earliest Ford Model A cars imported to Britain. He was afterwards involved in an agency importing Ford cars, and during 1906 visited Detroit to meet Henry Ford. It was Perry who envisioned Ford's manufacturing motor vehicles outside the USA for sale across the British empire and Europe. He raced the company's cars, and in 1907, on the occasion of the motoring exhibition at Olympia, published <span class="italic">The O.K. Verses</span>, a pastiche on &#145;Umar Khayyam, giving a boisterous account of contemporary motoring and its cars, racing drivers, chauffeurs, makers, and touts. After being appointed in 1909 to run Ford's new showroom in London he organized a national network of exclusive dealers and superintended an assembly plant at Trafford Park which began production in 1911. The Ford Motor Company (England) Ltd was established in that year as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Detroit business, and proved indispensable after the imposition of McKenna import duties in 1915 enforced the need for the company to manufacture in Britain. Perry broke trade unionism at his factory and imposed job mobility, time wages, and direct managerial control over production, while paying his workers more than was usual in his sector. Ford's mechanized chassis assembly system, which was inaugurated in 1914, was the first in Britain.<br>
<br>Perry worked without remuneration as deputy controller of the food production department of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1916, and then as director of the agricultural machinery department of the Ministry of Munitions in 1917&#150;18. He was deputy controller of the mechanical warfare department and director of traction at the same ministry in 1918&#150;19. His wartime experiences gave him a rooted objection to state controls over manufacturing. He was appointed CBE in 1917 and knighted in 1918.<br>
<br>After the war Henry Ford wanted to run British operations from Detroit despite Perry's determination to direct all European business himself. Their differences could not be reconciled, and in May 1919 Perry resigned. He led a group which in April 1920 bought the Slough motor car repair depot (comprising 600 acres and 15,000 vehicles) from the Ministry of Munitions for &pound;3.35 million. This property was converted into a model manufacturing estate based on Trafford Park. In 1922 Perry resigned as chairman and managing director of Slough Estates (although remaining on its board) having acquired the lease of the 300 acre Isle of Herm, in the Channel Islands, from the writer Compton Mackenzie. Perry lived for several years on Herm, where with his wife he wrote <span class="italic">The Island of Enchantment</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Ford's American managers having failed in Britain, he offered Perry the chairmanship of the newly formed Ford Motor Company Limited in 1928. Perry accepted, taking responsibility for Ford's new Dagenham factory, which was the largest automobile factory in the world outside the USA and by 1936 produced over 94,000 vehicles annually. The Dagenham plant in 1932 launched an 8 hp model costing &pound;120 which was the first Ford car specifically made for European markets; it sustained the business through the depression. There was much less interference from Detroit under this new regime, and the policy of using British rather than American managers was soon vindicated. Perry in 1928 devised a new European strategy, which was, however, frustrated by deteriorating political and fiscal conditions. He superintended factories and assembly plants in &Eacute;ire, Denmark, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, and maintained an English suzerainty over Ford's European operations.<br>
<br>Perry, who was interested in agriculture, instituted an experiment in co-operative farming, the Fordson farms, at Boreham in Essex during the 1930s. He was business adviser to the minister of food in 1939&#150;40, and held outside directorships with the Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company and the National Provincial Bank. He enjoyed literary dabbling, and wrote <span class="italic">New Songs</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">The International Balance of Trade</span> (1932), as well as pamphlets advocating &#145;free enterprise&#146; published by the Individualist Bookshop in the early 1940s. In 1943 he led the formation of the propagandist body Aims of Industry, of which he was first president.<br>
<br>Perry was stocky and genial-looking; heavy spectacles masked granite grey eyes of a rather designing hardness. He was keen, energetic, independent-minded, and personable, with an aptitude for selecting and motivating his staff. In the motor industry he was considered urbane and even intellectual; by contrast, the memoirs of his literary neighbour Sir Compton Mackenzie depict him as vulgar, pawky, penny-pinching, and complacent. He received an honorary LLD from Birmingham University in 1937 and was awarded several foreign decorations. He was raised to the peerage in 1938. Having retired from Ford in 1948, Perry died on 17 June 1956, at New Providence Island in the Bahamas, when his peerage became extinct. His wife died in the Bahamas in December 1956.<br>
