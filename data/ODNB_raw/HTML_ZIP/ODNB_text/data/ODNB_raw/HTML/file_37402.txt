<span class="headword">Evesham,  Epiphanius</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1570&#150;<em>c.</em>1623), <span class="occ">sculptor, painter, and metal-engraver</span>, was born in or before 1570, perhaps on the feast day of the Epiphany (6 January), the fourteenth and youngest son of William Evesham (1518/19&#150;1584) and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1570), daughter of Alexander Howarth (or Howorth) of Burghill. His childhood is obscure and there is no reliable evidence as to his training. His first recorded work is a sundial (Hereford City Museum and Art Gallery) which he made in 1589 for John Evesham, probably one of his brothers of that name. The family was in London when William died, on 12 June 1584, and during the 1590s Epiphanius appears to have had his workshop in the capital. Two signed memorial tablets at Mersham and Hythe in Kent bear dates of death in this decade.<br>
<br>By 1600 Evesham had moved to Paris where he lived until at least 1615. He worked for a while with the sculptor Mathieu Jacquet before attempting to strike out on his own, but was called to account by the city's guild of painters and sculptors for claiming to practise their art while being in reality no more than a &#145;sawer and polisher of marble&#146;. He finally became a master in the guild in 1604. His stay abroad is well documented&#151;far better than his life in England&#151;but his major works of that period all appear to be lost. They included a group of Neptune on three sea horses, perhaps intended for a fountain, which Evesham caused to be cast in metal under a subcontract of 1601, a tomb slab commemorating the archbishop of Sens in the cathedral of Notre Dame (1606&#150;7), and a more elaborate memorial with a kneeling effigy, erected to Jacques de Poyanne in the church of the convent of the Grands Augustins (1611). In documents dating from between 1608 and 1614 Evesham is referred to both as a sculptor and as a painter, and he may well have begun three pictures that included votive portraits of himself and members of his family and which, in 1611, he commissioned another artist to complete.<br>
<br>Evesham returned to England about 1617 and, so far as is known, confined himself to tomb sculpture thereafter. The signed monument to Sir Thomas Hawkins and his wife at Boughton under Blean, Kent, must date from about 1618: it shows a skill in pictorial relief carving which is rare in early seventeenth-century English sculpture. His mature manner is also exemplified by the tomb chest of Edmund West (<i>d</i>. 1618) at Marsworth, Buckinghamshire, with its signed effigial brass and series of carved panels, some incised, others in relief. The subject matter of the panels is not entirely clear, but part of it is on the theme of death and resurrection, and he defied protestant convention by including a figure of Christ who is shown as the redeemer, risen from the grave. Another brass was destroyed in the great fire of London: it was the memorial in Old St Paul's to the poet John Owen (<i>d</i>. 1622) and gave rise to John Penkethman's encomium on Evesham as &#145;that most exquisite artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Epigrams of P. Virgilius Maro</span>, sig. D3v).<br>
<br>By the mid-1620s Evesham may have been in financial straits. His kinsman Richard, earl of Cork, noted in October 1628 that the sculptor had begun a monument to Cork's eldest son, the Hon. Roger Boyle, but had pawned the work. It had to be finished by another artist, James White of Long Acre, and was eventually erected in St Nicholas's, Deptford, London. The final phase of his career is best represented by the monument to Christopher Roper, Lord Teynham (<i>d</i>. 1622), at Lynsted, Kent. The deceased is shown recumbent, mourned by his wife who kneels over him, and by his sons and daughters who are shown in relief on a pair of panels fixed to the tomb chest. The highly expressive panel of the grief-stricken daughters is a minor masterpiece and sufficient in itself to explain Penkethman's enthusiasm for the work of its creator.<br>
<br>This small group of authenticated church monuments has formed the basis of some fifty attributions. Few of them, however, stand up to close scrutiny and they have had the effect of artificially extending Evesham's career into the 1630s. Figured panels of alabaster which closely resemble those on the Hawkins and Teynham monuments have been cited in support of two attributions which remain convincing. The memorial to Sir Adrian Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1623) at South Cockerington, Lincolnshire, shows the subject's offspring kneeling against the tomb chest like the Teynham and Hawkins children, while the monument to Richard, Lord Rich (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;21), at Felsted, Essex, is grandly embellished with scenes from the life of the deceased. There are also substantial reasons for attributing to Evesham the monuments to Cicile and Ellenor, the wives of Sir John Denham (<i>c</i>.1619), at Egham, Surrey, and to Sir Justinian Lewin (<i>d</i>. 1620) at Otterden, Kent.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that Evesham was a Catholic recusant. His connection with Paris, at that time a Catholic stronghold, combined with the fact that he had recusant patrons in England, and the exceptional range of religious images which occur in his work all seem to support this theory but his name has yet to be traced in the contemporary annals of the Catholic faith. He is known to have married; however, no further details of his family, nor the date and place of his death are known.<br>
