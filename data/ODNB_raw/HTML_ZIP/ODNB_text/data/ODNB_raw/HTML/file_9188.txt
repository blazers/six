<span class="headword">Farre,  Arthur</span>  (1811&#150;1887), <span class="occ">obstetrician</span>, younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9190/', "John Richard Farre (1775&#150;1862)")</script>, physician, of Charterhouse Square, London, was born in London on 6 March 1811. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9189/', "Frederic John Farre")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. After studying medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, he graduated MB at Cambridge in 1833 and MD in 1841, and he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1843. In 1836&#150;7 he lectured on comparative anatomy at St Bartholomew's, and from 1838 to 1840 on forensic medicine. In 1841 he succeeded Robert Ferguson as professor of obstetric medicine at King's College, and as physician-accoucheur to King's College Hospital, offices he held until 1862. At the Royal College of Physicians he was in succession censor, examiner, and councillor, and was Harveian orator in 1872. For twenty-four years (1852&#150;75) he was examiner in midwifery to the Royal College of Surgeons, but resigned with his colleagues William Priestley and Robert Barnes when the college resolved to admit Sophia Jex-Blake and other women to the examination in midwifery. Farre and the other examiners resigned on the grounds that as the women did not possess qualifications in medicine or surgery they were automatically excluded from holding the midwifery licence. Although the plan was successful in the short term (no suitable successors could be found to fill the post of examiner) the action by Farre and his colleagues hastened parliamentary action that led to the <span class="roman">Russell Gurney Act</span> (1876), which empowered all licensing bodies to examine women for medical qualifications.<br>
<br>Farre's personal qualities enabled him to be a successful and fashionable obstetrician; he attended the princess of Wales and other members of the royal family, and was made physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria. His principal contribution to medical literature was an article on &#145;The uterus and its appendages&#146;, constituting parts 49 and 50 of Todd's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology</span> (1858). He contributed numerous papers on microscopy to the <span class="italic">Royal Microscopical Society's Journal and Transactions</span>, and was president of the society in 1851&#150;2. An early microscopical paper of his, &#145;On the minute structure of some of the higher forms of polypi&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1837), secured his election into the Royal Society in 1839. On the death of Sir Charles Locock in 1875, Farre was elected honorary president of the Obstetrical Society of London, to which he gave a valuable collection of pelves and gynaecological casts. Farre enjoyed music and was a keen photographer. In manner he was precise and formal. He died at his home, 18 Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster, London, on 17 December 1887, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 22 December. His wife predeceased him and there were no children. Shortly after her death he fell out of his bedroom window, and broke his ankle. He was never the same again.<br>
