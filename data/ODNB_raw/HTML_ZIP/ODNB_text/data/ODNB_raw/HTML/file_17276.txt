<span class="headword">Lyon, Sir  James Frederick</span>  (1775&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, a descendant of the Lyons, lords Glamis, was son of Captain James Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1775), 35th foot, and his wife Mary (later Mrs George Coke), daughter of James Hamilton of Ballencrieff, East Lothian, and great-great-grandson of Sir Patrick Lyon of Carse (1637&#150;1694). He was born on board a transport ship homeward bound from America after the battle of Bunker Hill, where his father had been killed. On 4 August 1791 he was appointed ensign, 25th foot (later King's Own Scottish Borderers). He became lieutenant on 26 April 1793, captain on 5 April 1795, major on 21 February 1799, brevet-colonel in 1811, major-general in 1814, and lieutenant-general in 1830.<br>
<br>Lyon served with detachments of the 25th as marines on board the <i>Gibraltar</i> (80 guns, Captain Mackenzie) and the <i>Marlborough</i> (74 guns, Captain Hon. George Berkeley) in the Channel Fleet under Earl Howe. He was present at the actions of 27 and 29 May, and the great victory of 1 June 1794. He afterwards served with his regiment in the island of Grenada during the reign of terror there, when Governor Home and all the principal white inhabitants were massacred by the slaves. He was on Lord George Lennox's staff at Plymouth in 1797&#150;8, and was subsequently aide-de-camp to the Hon. Sir Charles Steuart at Minorca. In 1799 he was appointed to a foreign corps, originally known as &#145;Stuart's&#146;, or the Minorca regiment, raised in that island by Sir John Stuart (afterwards count of Maida), with Lyon and Nicholas Trant as majors. The corps was successively known as the Queen's German regiment and the 97th (Queen's), and was disbanded as the 96th (Queen's) in 1818. Lyon was with it in 1801 in Egypt, where it was engaged with Bonaparte's &#145;invincibles&#146; at the battle of 21 March 1801, and was highly distinguished. Lyon subsequently commanded the regiment in the Peninsula from 1808 to 1811 at Vimeiro, Talavera, Busaco, and the first siege of Badajoz. In June 1813 he was sent to Germany to assist in organizing the new Hanoverian levies (distinct from the King's German Legion), and he was present at the operations in the north of Germany in 1813&#150;14, under the prince royal of Sweden. He led a division of Hanoverians at the battle of G&ouml;hrde in Hanover, on 13 September 1813, and afterwards was in charge of a mixed force of Russians, Hanoverians, and Hanseatics, under Count von Benningsen, which blockaded Hamburg. He commanded the 6th Hanoverian brigade during the Waterloo campaign and the advance to Paris. The brigade was with the reserve near Hal on 18 June, and did not engage. Lyon commanded the inland district in 1817, and he led the troops in the Windward and Leeward islands, with headquarters at Barbados, in 1828&#150;33. He was promised the governorship of Gibraltar, but was disappointed. Lyon was a KCB and KCH (1815), GCH (1817), and had the orders of the Sword in Sweden and Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria, with gold medals for Egypt, Vimeiro and Talavera, and the Hanoverian and Waterloo medals. He was colonel of the 24th foot, and equerry to the duke of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Lyon married Anne, daughter of Edward Coxe of Hampstead, and niece of the Revd George Coxe (his stepfather), Peter Coxe (1753?&#150;1844), and Archdeacon William Coxe (1748&#150;1828), the historian. Lyon lived latterly at Grosvenor Lodge, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and died at Brighton on 16 October 1842.<br>
