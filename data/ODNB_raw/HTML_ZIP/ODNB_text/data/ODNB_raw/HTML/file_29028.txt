<span class="headword">Welsh,  Thomas</span>  (1781&#150;1848), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at Wells, Somerset, the son of John Welsh and his wife, who was a daughter of the elder <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16737/', "Thomas Linley (1733&#150;1795)")</script>. At the age of six he became a chorister at Wells Cathedral, where his singing soon attracted an eager audience. Sheridan heard of him, and persuaded Linley to engage him for the 1792 Bath concerts. His first opera appearance was in 1792 in Thomas Attwood's <span class="italic">The Prisoner</span>, written especially for him, and he performed at Drury Lane Theatre in 1795 in Attwood's <span class="italic">The Adopted Child</span> and Storace's version of <span class="italic">Lodoiska</span>. John Kemble promoted him as an actor, and coached him in the part of Prince Arthur in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">King John</span>. Meanwhile Welsh was continuing his musical education under Karl Friedrich Horn, Johann Baptist Cramer, and Karl Friedrich Baumgarten. In 1802 he was admitted as a gentleman of the Chapel Royal.<br>
<br>Welsh, who was a bass, was most renowned as a singing teacher. His pupils included John Sinclair, Charles Edward Horn, and Catherine Stephens. <a name="cosubject_29678"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ann Wilson</span>  (1802&#150;1867)<span class="occ"></span>, who was also his pupil, became his second wife on 9 June 1827. They had one daughter, who married the cellist Alfredo Piatti. Mary Ann Wilson had made her d&eacute;but as Mandane in Arne's <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span> at Drury Lane in January 1821, and had created a great sensation. Her career was lucrative but short, as her exertions led to a breakdown in her health and the ruin of her voice. Welsh produced two farces at the Lyceum Theatre, an opera, <span class="italic">Kamskatka</span>, at Covent Garden, and music for several plays. He also wrote several songs, glees, partsongs, and duets. His song &#145;Harry Bluff&#146; was popular, and his glee &#145;Hark! 'tis the whistling wind&#146; won a prize in 1813. He published a <span class="italic">Vocal Instructor</span> in 1825. He died in Brighton on 31 January 1848.<br>
