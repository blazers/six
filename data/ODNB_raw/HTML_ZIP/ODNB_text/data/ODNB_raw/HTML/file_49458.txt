<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hopps,  John Page</span>  (1834&#150;1911), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born in London on 6 November 1834; nothing is known about his origins and upbringing other than that his father was Cordt Hopps, a stall merchant. After studying at Leicester Baptist college, in 1856 he became minister of a Baptist meeting at Hugglescote, Leicestershire. Doubts having set in, the next year he became an assistant to the Revd George Dawson (1821&#150;1876), the great Birmingham preacher whose migration from the Baptist faith to liberal non-denominationalism was reflected in a succession of assistants making similar pilgrimages. On 13 June 1859 Hopps married Mary Jackson (1838&#150;1902), daughter of Edward Jackson, a farmer; four children were born to the couple. Following his first wife's death, he married Alice Elizabeth Hallawell (<i>b</i>. 1876), the daughter of a London merchant, on 13 July 1903.<br>
<br>In 1860 Hopps became minister at Upperthorpe Chapel, a new Unitarian congregation in Sheffield, moving from there to Old Chapel, Dukinfield, in 1863 and in 1869 to the splendidly idiosyncratic classical chapel in St Vincent's Street, Glasgow, erected in 1856 and demolished in 1982. Known as a compelling preacher and social activist&#151;in 1874 he was elected to the Glasgow school board, where he was an advocate of secular education&#151;he was called in 1876 to one of the most prominent Unitarian congregations, Great Meeting, Leicester, at the large stipend of &pound;400. There for a time he was even more successful than in Glasgow, but by 1892 tensions had set in, and he left for the Free Christian church, Croydon, where he remained until 1905, successfully building up a relatively new foundation, though he found metropolitan piety inferior to that in the midlands and the north. He then became minister at Little Portland Street, the chapel identified with the London career of James Martineau (1805&#150;1900). On its closure in 1909 the congregation moved to University Hall in Gordon Square, where Hopps preached his last sermon on the Sunday before his death.<br>
<br>A slight man with a massive head and rugged face, gifted with a fine voice and a quick sense of humour, Hopps saw the preacher's art as the key to filling churches, repeatedly citing the spell-binding Baptist Charles Haddon Spurgeon (1834&#150;1892) as proof. His buoyant personality is caught in his habit of signing letters &#145;Heartily yours&#146;, even when, during his Leicester troubles, he was reflecting gloomily on the future of Unitarianism.<br>
<br>An inveterate publisher of sermons, hymns, and manuals for family worship, Hopps also edited two periodicals, <span class="italic">The Truthseeker</span> from 1863 to 1887 and the <span class="italic">Coming Day</span> from 1891 until his death. But he also advocated less conventional means for spreading the Christian message. Floral Hall, opened in Leicester in 1880 to appeal to unchurched working people through flowers, music, and popular preaching, drew an estimated attendance of 40,000 in the last year of its existence; its sale in 1886, without his consent, began the series of disappointments that led to his leaving Leicester. His later campaign for &#145;Our Father's Church&#146; sought to transform and transcend his own congregation to unite people from all denominations in spiritual development and social sympathy.<br>
<br>While honouring the Unitarian contribution to free inquiry and religious liberty, Hopps thought that Unitarian doctrine had outlived its usefulness and welcomed the Free Christian movement promoted by Martineau and his friends in the 1860s. But he moved on to new enthusiasms characteristic of a generation to whom traditional theological questions seemed increasingly irrelevant. Of these, the most remarkable was spiritualism, for which he was prepared by an early exposure to Swedenborgianism and by his mother's spiritualist experiences and to which he turned during a mental crisis in the mid-1860s. His spiritualism was consistent with his all-embracing humanitarianism and an expansive view of God as a spirit, not a person. Rejecting belief in the resurrection of the body, he was an early advocate of cremation.<br>
<br>Politically, Hopps was an advanced Liberal. In 1886, determined to defend W. E. Gladstone against what he saw as tory abuse, he undertook a hopeless candidacy against Lord Randolph Churchill in Paddington, losing by 2576 votes to 769. He was a strong supporter of Irish home rule&#151;a position that weakened his standing in his Leicester congregation&#151;land reform, anti-vivisection, and the peace movement. He frequently wrote for newspapers, among them <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, and his stern criticism of British South African policy early in the new century appeared in the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, edited from 1902 to 1907 by a Unitarian minister, Harold Rylett (1851&#150;1936).<br>
<br>Hopps died of heart failure on 6 April 1911 at The Roserie, his house in Broadlands Avenue, Shepperton-on-Thames. The funeral service was held on 11 April at the Woking crematorium.<br>
