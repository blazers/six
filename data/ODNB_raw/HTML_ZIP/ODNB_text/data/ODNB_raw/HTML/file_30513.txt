<span class="headword">Backhouse, Sir  Edmund Trelawny</span>, second baronet  (1873&#150;1944), <span class="occ">Sinologist and fraudster</span>, eldest of the four surviving sons of Jonathan Edmund Backhouse, first baronet (1849&#150;1918), a banker, and Florence (1845&#150;1902), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56067/', "Sir John Salusbury Salusbury-Trelawny")</script>, was born on 20 October 1873 at The Rookery, Middleton Tyas, Yorkshire. The naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30514/', "Roger Roland Charles Backhouse")</script> and the political activist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51972/', "Harriet Jane Findlay")</script> were among his siblings. Educated at St George's School, Ascot (1882&#150;6), and then at Winchester College, he entered Merton College, Oxford, as a &#145;postmaster&#146; (foundation scholar) in 1892. At Oxford, Backhouse rebelled against his provincial, middle-class, Quaker origins, spending some &pound;23,000 in three years on a cult of Ellen Terry, on jewellery, and on buying his way into a set of homosexual aesthetes. His studies&#151;first classics, then English literature&#151;were interrupted by a nervous breakdown in mid-1894. Although he had returned to Merton by the end of the year, he left Oxford in 1895 without taking a degree. His debts caught up with him shortly thereafter, and he seems to have fled abroad at the end of the year, at which point his affairs were wound up and bankruptcy proceedings initiated. Backhouse probably visited Greece, Russia, and the United States in this period, but next surfaced for certain in Cambridge, in July 1898, studying Chinese for three months with H. A. Giles. To China Backhouse went at the end of the same year, probably under family diktat: he was never to live in Britain again, but received an allowance from his father, and then, after the latter's death in 1918, from the estate, until his own death.<br>
<br>Failing to find a career in the Chinese customs service Backhouse worked unpaid from 1899 for G. E. Morrison, providing translations of Chinese documents for this influential correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who acted as his patron and who also attempted, unsuccessfully, to repair Backhouse's relations with his father. Through Morrison he came to know J. O. P. Bland, secretary of the Shanghai municipal council and Shanghai correspondent for the paper. In 1909 Bland and Backhouse began their own collaboration on what was to become the most successful, and most disputed, contribution to modern Chinese history then published in Britain. <span class="italic">China under the Empress Dowager</span> (1910) consisted largely of documents translated by Backhouse, and polished by Bland, who constructed around them a vivid narrative of the latter days of the Qing dynasty and the Boxer uprising of 1900. The centrepiece of the volume was the purported diary of Jingshan, the Manchu official in whose house Backhouse was billeted in the aftermath of the rising. Backhouse claimed to have found the diary on entering the house, but is now known to have been, if not its forger, then certainly a close party to the forgery. He deposited the published sections in the British Museum in 1910, but his ineffective responses to challenges against the authenticity of the diary in the 1930s indicate that he knew full well that it was a fraud. Morrison, who knew Backhouse better than anyone at this point, always believed it to be so.<br>
<br>Backhouse's reputation as a Sinologist, however, was cemented by this work, and by a further volume with Bland, <span class="italic">Annals and Memoirs of the Court of Peking</span> (1914), and his collaboration with Sir Sydney Barton on a revision of Hillier's <span class="italic">Pocket Dictionary of Colloquial Chinese</span> (1918). On this basis he began fishing for an academic position in Britain. He was elected to the chair of Chinese at King's College, London, in December 1913 but never took it up, preferring to wait instead for the Oxford professorship, for which he appeared to be heir apparent. Backhouse had been smoothing his way back into Oxford with substantial donations of valuable Chinese books to the Bodleian Library in 1912 and 1914&#150;15, but was to be disappointed in 1920 when W. E. Soothill was elected to the post. Thereafter his dealings with the Bodleian became more and more puzzling; he was advanced money to purchase books which never arrived in Oxford, or scrolls which turned out to be crude forgeries. The consequently strained relations between the Bodleian and Backhouse terminated in 1924&#151;but not before his name was added to its benefactors' roll of honour, inscribed in stone.<br>
<br>Such strange activities had, in fact, become the singular feature of Backhouse's life. In Peking (Beijing) he had found employment in a variety of fields, using his language skills and contacts. He was a fixer and then an agent (1908&#150;10) for the railway concession hunter Charles, sixth Lord ffrench, and an agent for the sale of battleships (1910&#150;17) and of banknotes (1915&#150;17). He was also trusted by Sir John Jordan at the British legation with a fantastic scheme to buy up surplus rifles in China for the British army in 1915. Backhouse's earliest activities on behalf of ffrench and the American Willard Straight appear to have been legitimate, and successful, but later he began to concoct contracts and contacts. Backhouse &#145;sold&#146; six phantom battleships in 1916 for John Brown &amp; Co. and 650 million imaginary banknotes that same year for the American Banknote Company of New York. In 1915 he assembled an imaginary flotilla of cargo ships, laden with rifles and machine-guns, whose progress down the Chinese coast from Shanghai to Canton (Guangzhou) is minutely recorded in the Foreign Office archives, but which never in fact existed. The complications created by these various plots, which unravelled at much the same time, caused him to flee China for Vancouver for a year in late 1917. He succeeded his father as baronet in 1918, but inherited nothing in the will, although his family footed much of the bill for his frauds on condition that he did not leave China.<br>
<br>In China, Backhouse's affairs became rather less ambitious in the 1920s and 1930s. He retreated further into the eccentric seclusion in Peking for which he was already well known&#151;avoiding even accidental contact with Westerners, and dressing always in Chinese clothes. He seems to have been involved in various schemes, mostly shadowy or speculative, involving Chinese antiques and other articles, and to have been somewhat in thrall to his Chinese secretary. Backhouse was intermittently consulted as a scholar by the British legation but, while occasionally threatening writs against those who denied the authenticity of the Jingshan diary, he published nothing. His much vaunted projects, notably a new dictionary to trump Giles's standard work, were probably imaginary. His inactivity, and his reclusive behaviour, drew to him an air of scholar-gentlemanliness which impressed the small British colony in the 1930s, notably his first <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> biographer, the painter Hope Danby.<br>
<br>The Sino-Japanese War after 1937 made life somewhat difficult for foreigners in Peking. Backhouse was forced to seek temporary refuge in the British legation in 1937, and in 1938 almost returned to Britain at the expense of his wearily loyal and worried family. He took final refuge in part of the unoccupied former Austrian legation in Peking's legation quarter in 1939, after the destruction of his house. There he drew to himself the admiring attention of the Swiss consul, Dr Richard Hoeppli, whom he regaled with tales of his lifelong, mostly homosexual, sexual adventures. Backhouse's notorious unpublished two volumes of memoirs, minutely detailing his intimacy with, among many others, Lord Rosebery and the Dowager Empress Cixi, were written at Hoeppli's request, and are largely constructed around imaginary interactions between himself and the blue-blooded and infamous. While vivid and pungent, the two books, &#145;D&eacute;cadence Mandchoue&#146; and &#145;The Dead Past&#146;, are drearily pornographic, enlivened only by splenetic outbursts against all those who had somehow conspired to suppress their author. These memoirs, fittingly, formed his last and posthumous contribution to the Bodleian.<br>
<br>Refusing (he claimed) repatriation in 1942, the by now sclerotically anti-British baronet stayed on in Japanese-occupied Peking. He converted to Catholicism in 1942, hoping that the church in Peking would provide him with money and shelter, as he was an enemy alien in distressed circumstances. This hope does not appear to have been realized. He died on 8 January 1944 in the Catholic H&ocirc;pital St Michel, Wangfujing, Peking, and was buried at the Chala Catholic cemetery at Pingzemen.<br>
<br>Backhouse developed a considerable reputation as a Sinologist, but hardly deserved it. He was certainly linguistically gifted, but his intellectual arrogance was considerable, and unfounded, while even his mastery of Chinese has not stood up to thorough examination. He was throughout his life hermitic, eccentric, evasive, litigious, profligate, and a gross snob; but he was also charmingly gentlemanly and persuasive. His fraudulent successes often owed as much to the ignorance and snobbery of those he duped as they did to his own skills. His Sinological successes owed much to the poor state of Chinese studies in Britain.<br>
<br>Backhouse's entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> was the sole biographical note published about him until 1976, and much of the information recounted here was not at all widely known before then. His singular and lasting reputation is not as a Sinologist but as a fraud, fantasist, and forger, and to this fact he is indebted to his elegant biographer, Hugh Trevor-Roper. Backhouse may indeed in his memoirs have been the chronicler of, for example, male brothel life in late-imperial Peking, and there may be many small truths in those manuscripts that fill out the picture of his life, but we know now that not a word he ever said or wrote can be trusted.<br>
