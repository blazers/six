<span class="headword">Newbery,  Elizabeth</span>  (1745/6&#150;1821), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, is of obscure origins. Family correspondence describes her father as &#145;Bryant the trunk merchant&#146;&#151;probably the James Bryant at the corner of St Paul's &#145;facing Cheapside&#146;&#151;but nothing else is known of her background or early life. She was later married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73298/', "Francis Newbery (d. 1780)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19977/', "Newbery, Francis")</script>], the nephew of John Newbery. Francis had worked for his uncle and inherited the publishing business with John's son Francis and his stepson Thomas Carnan, but they quarrelled, and Francis set up his own premises at 20 Ludgate Street. On her husband's death, Elizabeth inherited his business in January 1780; his will appointed her sole executor. In 1786 fire destroyed a large part of the stock, and for part of 1787 Elizabeth lived at 37 Ludgate Street.<br>
<br>Beginning with Charles Welsh, the first biographer of John Newbery, scholars have tended to assume Elizabeth had a merely caretaking role in the history of the prestigious Newbery firm. Evidence to support this position is tenuous, derived largely from the surviving account books of Richard Johnson, a hack writer and compiler who provided the Newberys with a substantial number of manuscripts between 1770 and 1792. These records show payments and records of orders from Elizabeth in 1780 and 1785; after that date they refer only to Abraham Badcock, her manager. Contemporary accounts of Badcock make clear his talents, but this is as much an argument for Elizabeth's business acumen as for her secondary role. During her twenty-two-year tenure Elizabeth published over 300 juvenile titles, three out of four under her sole imprint. The moral and didactic writing which dominated her list in comparison with that of John Newbery reflected the contemporary market rather than any inherent lack of his light-hearted touch. As John Newbery and then her husband had done, Elizabeth used internal publisher's &#145;puffs&#146; to sell her wares, and she expanded the bookselling business, maintaining stock from other publishers for sale in her catalogues and shop. Her control spanned the decades in which children's books became an established branch of the publishing industry, and her list included abridgements of Richardson and Fielding, English writers such as Sarah Trimmer and Priscilla Wakefield, and versions of traditional tales including the &#145;Cries of London&#146; and the &#145;Arabian Nights&#146;. She employed the engraver Thomas Bewick, most notably to illustrate Arnaud Berquin's <span class="italic">Looking-Glass for the Mind</span> (1792) and J. H. Wynne's <span class="italic">Tales for Youth</span> (1794). She published the geographical games of the Abb&eacute; Gaultier and commissioned a historical game which she published jointly with John Wallis. She collaborated with other publishers including Vernor and Hood, and Francis's cousin Thomas Carnan, and after Carnan's death she reprinted titles from the Carnan&#150;Newbery list as well as her own. She also published over 200 adult titles, but these were often joint ventures and her participation may have been merely financial. The only appearance of Elizabeth's imprint before 1780 was the <span class="italic">Middlesex Journal</span> for 1772&#150;3 but her name appeared on the January issue of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> immediately following Francis's death. A few books with her imprint appeared after the sale to Harris, suggesting she retained an interest in publishing, and her obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> describes her as adding &#145;many an useful and engaging work to the stock of juvenile literature&#146; built up by John and Francis Newbery.<br>
<br>In 1802 Elizabeth sold the business to John Harris (who had succeeded Abraham Badcock as her manager after Badcock's death in 1797). She died in Clapham on 21 October 1821, aged seventy-five, &#145;after an illness of 16 years, endured with uncommon fortitude and resignation&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 377). According to an 1830 letter by a Newbery descendant, Elizabeth had remarried, but throughout her career had &#145;continued the business and retained on the shop and title pages, the name that had been to her so prosperous&#146;. However, her will, drawn up in 1820, was also in the name of Newbery, and her obituary makes no reference to a second marriage. Elizabeth also continued to receive dividends from an inherited share in the Stationers' Company English stock which she would have lost had she remarried. Given the value of her estate&#151;some &pound;20,000 in specific bequests&#151;dividends of approximately &pound;5 a year would not seem worth the hiding of a second marriage. Her will is interesting for the careful provision of money for female relatives and dependants. The money designated for her surviving sister, Susanna, who received the bulk of the estate, and that for Susanna's daughter, was to be held in trust in such a fashion that it could not be used by their husbands. Among the smaller bequests are those to young Newbery and Bryant relations, to the daughters of John Harris the younger, and to her servants. The executors, John Harris the elder, George Royde, William Bryant, and John Harris the younger were given &pound;50 each for their trouble but Royde also received a separate legacy of &pound;3000. John Harris or, failing him, his son, was granted the right to purchase the one-twelfth share in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> that Elizabeth had inherited from Francis.<br>
