<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thurlow,  Edward</span>, first Baron Thurlow  (1731&#150;1806), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born at Bracon Ash, Norfolk, on 9 December 1731, the eldest son of Thomas Thurlow (<i>bap</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. 1762), a Church of England clergyman who held a series of small livings in Suffolk and Norfolk, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1736), the daughter of Robert Smith of Ashfield, Suffolk. The roots of his father's family at Burnham Overy, Norfolk, went back at least to the sixteenth century. It was characteristic of Thurlow's inverted snobbery that, in later life, he claimed descent not from Oliver Cromwell's secretary John Thurloe, but from a (possibly invented) humbler ancestor, &#145;Thurloe the carrier&#146;. He had two sisters and three brothers, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27408/', "Thomas Thurlow (1737&#150;1791)")</script> became successively bishop of Lincoln and of Durham and John Thurlow (<i>d</i>. 1782) became an alderman of Norwich.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Thurlow was for his first few years educated at home, but at the age of nine he was sent to Tacolneston, Norfolk, for two years under the tutorship of one Mr Browne. Then he studied under a Mr Brett at a small school at Seckars, Scarning, from approximately 1742 until 1747. He quickly acquired, and never lost, a reputation for recalcitrance and rudeness which was probably as well deserved as the recognition of his intellectual abilities. Later in his life, when attorney-general, Thurlow is said to have rebuffed a greeting from his former schoolmaster Brett with the words &#145;Am I bound to recollect every scoundrel who recollects me?&#146;  (Gore-Browne, 4). Thurlow's last school was King's, Canterbury, where he spent a year under the tuition of the formidable headmaster Robert Talbot. Here he showed more amenability, and he subsequently spoke of Talbot with appreciation. On 5 October 1748 he was admitted as a pensioner to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a Perse scholar from 1748 to 1751. His conduct at university was, by all accounts, ill-mannered and rebellious in the extreme, and his idleness and sardonic wit brought him into constant conflict with authority. Only John Smith, his tutor, earned his approval. In 1751 Thurlow withdrew from Cambridge without a degree; according to the tactful obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> &#145;the vivacity of his conduct obliged him to leave&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 76, 1806, 882). Thurlow had determined to study for the legal profession, and on 9 January 1752 he was admitted a member of the Inner Temple. He worked as a pupil in the offices of Chapman, a solicitor in Holborn, where he formed a lifelong friendship with a fellow pupil, the poet William Cowper. Although Cowper recorded that he and Thurlow spent their time &#145;giggling and making giggle instead of studying the law&#146;  (Gore-Browne, 7), it is clear that Thurlow worked diligently, albeit irregularly, at his studies; he also spent much of his time in witty conversation at Nando's Coffee House in Fleet Street, which was to play an important part in his private as well as his professional life.<br>
<br>Thurlow was called to the bar on 22 November 1754, took chambers in Fig-Tree Court, and began to practise on the western circuit. Although he established firm professional friendships with Lloyd Kenyon and John Dunning, his early years at the bar were not marked by success. His earnings were meagre, he was severely chastised by Lord Mansfield when defeated in a suit over a marriage settlement, and in 1762 he appears to have contemplated quitting the legal profession. But there were achievements as well. In 1758 he made a powerful impression when he resisted, and repaid with interest, the aggressive tactics of Sir Fletcher Norton in the case of Luke Robinson versus the earl of Winchilsea. He also received favourable attention when appearing for the defence of the publisher Jacob Tonson in a copyright suit in 1761. His forensic techniques depended on massive if rather unsystematic knowledge, the ability to master a brief very quickly, and a courtroom manner which could switch rapidly from the ferocious to the sardonic. He cultivated an image of rough, undeferential integrity. His success, though delayed, was substantial. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1762 and took silk later in the same year.<br>
<br>By this time Thurlow's oratorical abilities had come to the attention of politicians, and he became friendly with Lord Weymouth, a leading figure among the followers in parliament of the duke of Bedford. In June 1765 Weymouth was briefly appointed to the lord lieutenancy of Ireland and proposed to make Thurlow his chief secretary. Although in August Weymouth had to yield the lord lieutenancy to a Rockinghamite successor, he admired Thurlow sufficiently to bring him into parliament as member for the Staffordshire borough of Tamworth in December 1765. In the House of Commons Thurlow quickly established himself as the legal authority, and prominent speaker, of the Bedford group. He associated himself fully with that group's strong advocacy of British authority over the North American colonies and with its opposition to the domestic radicals, whose current champion was John Wilkes. Further honours now came Thurlow's way; in 1769 he became reader at the Inner Temple, and in the same year was elected recorder of Tamworth.<h2>
<a name="Privatelife"></a>Private life</h2>It seems that Thurlow never married, but in 1759 or 1760 he became acquainted with Catherine (Kitty) Lynch (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1760), the daughter of John Lynch, the dean of Canterbury, and his wife, Mary Wake. A romantic affair quickly developed, but it is not clear whether they were married, or, if they were, when and where the ceremony took place. There is evidence, however, that Kitty Lynch gave birth to a son in 1760, that she died in childbirth in so doing, and that the paternity of Thurlow was widely acknowledged. In 1769 the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> referred to Kitty Lynch's brother William Lynch (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1785), MP for Canterbury, as Thurlow's brother-in-law, while the entry of Charles Thurlow at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1785 is recorded by Venn. In 1788 the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> noted the death at Canterbury of &#145;Mr Thurlow of Bennett College, Cambridge, son of the Lord Chancellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 13, 1788, 463), and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of that year made a similar comment. The claim that &#145;Kitty Lynch and Edward Thurlow, however impetuous their courting, were married before her untimely death&#146;  (Gore-Browne, 22) is plausible but cannot be confirmed. Later Thurlow formed a public but non-marital relationship with Polly Humphries, the daughter of the keeper of Nando's Coffee House. He purchased a comfortable, although not ostentatious, residence at Knight's Hill, near Dulwich, and lived with Polly Humphries in domestic tranquillity for the rest of his life. Their first child was stillborn in 1771; later they had three daughters.<h2>
<a name="Legalandpoliticaladvancement"></a>Legal and political advancement</h2>Thurlow's legal career was considerably advanced by his role in the celebrated Douglas case. There is no reason to reject the tradition that he became involved in the lawsuit concerning the disputed succession to the duke of Douglas's estates through a chance meeting in Nando's Coffee House with lawyers representing the Douglas claimant, Archibald James Edward Douglas. The court of session in Edinburgh had in 1767 decided by a narrow majority in favour of the rival Hamilton claimant. Thurlow, in animated conversation with a friend, is reported to have denounced the verdict and, in vehement terms, to have upheld the Douglas claim. He was promptly engaged by the Douglas party to represent them in the appeal before the House of Lords. On 16 January 1769, immediately before the case was heard, Thurlow was involved in a duel at Kensington Gravel Pits with the leading agent on the Hamilton side, Andrew Stuart. According to one account, &#145;One ball went through Mr T.'s wig, and T's ball went through S.'s coat, whereupon the seconds interfering, both parties were reconciled&#146;  (<span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span>, 1, 1769, 53). It was characteristic of Thurlow that his sardonic attacks upon Stuart, which had provoked the duel, were followed by a warm friendship between them. The Douglas case was heard before the House of Lords in February 1769, and, although speaking on the opposite side from his fellow Bedfordites, Thurlow helped to persuade the Lords to reverse the judgment of the court of session and to uphold the claim of the Douglas candidate. The case did not make Thurlow famous overnight&#151;he had already attained a reputation for competence in court and in parliament&#151;but it greatly enhanced his prestige. Lord John Campbell's verdict, that &#145;by his admirable pleading he showed what excellence he might have reached, and what solid fame he might have acquired, if his industry had been equal to his talent&#146;  (Campbell, 5.494), was somewhat ungenerous.<br>
<br>At the time of Thurlow's entry to the House of Commons the principal issue was the Rockingham administration's move to repeal the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> that had been passed by the Grenville ministry in 1765. Some of Thurlow's earliest interventions in debate and parliamentary votes were directed against the repeal. Later he attributed the rebellion of the colonies to &#145;a want of connection and dependance in the form of their government upon the mother country&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;Lord Thurlow&#146;, 66) and to a lack of ministerial firmness in 1766. With the entry of the Bedford group into the Chatham ministry in 1767&#150;8, Thurlow's career advanced further. He assisted in the prosecution cases against John Wilkes and, in June 1770, against John Almon, the publisher of Junius's &#145;Letter to the king&#146; of 19 December 1769. When the Bedfordites extended their support into the administration of Lord North, Thurlow achieved major office for the first time. He became solicitor-general in March 1770 and attorney-general in January 1771. As a leading law officer he was frequently called upon to pronounce in the Commons on the legality of the government's position, and in that capacity he became one of the most powerful spokesmen in favour of coercing the colonies. He reacted strongly to the colonial seizure of the revenue ship the <i>Gaspee</i> in 1772; according to John Pownall, under-secretary to the Board of Trade, Thurlow considered the incident to be of &#145;five times the magnitude of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 2.91). He warmly advocated the punitive legislation of 1774. His direct and bluff manner won him the respect, if not the affection, of the Commons, a large majority of whom supported North's American policy, while Thurlow's impatient disdain for dry pedantry distinguished him from many MPs who were lawyers. Grafton acknowledged Thurlow's status as &#145;a speaker of the first rate, as well in Parliament as at the Bar&#146;, but complained that &#145;his principles leaned to high Prerogative&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Autobiographical and Political Correspondence of the Duke of Grafton</span>, ed. W. R. Anson, 1898, 229). Thurlow himself argued that he was the advocate of a ministerial policy which sought to uphold the authority of parliament and thus to defend, not to subvert, the letter and spirit of the settlement of 1688&#150;9.<br>
<br>By the later 1770s Thurlow's opinions and political effectiveness commended him to George III. It is noteworthy that what the king might have been expected to perceive as moral failings did not prevent the growth of a personal friendship between them. After the surrender at Saratoga in 1777 and the French entry into the war the following year, the ministry of Lord North required a measure of stiffening, both internally and to fend off its increasingly numerous parliamentary critics. The need for intellectual reinforcement in the House of Lords led George III personally to arrange for Thurlow's promotion: &#145;I want an able Chancellor and therefore have pitched on Mr Thurlow&#146;, he wrote on 3 April 1778; five days later he added, &#145;I cannot begin to form any plan untill Mr Thurlow is in possession of the Great Seal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 4, nos. 2272 and 2284). On 3 June Thurlow was created Baron Thurlow of Ashfield, Suffolk, and became lord chancellor. At the same time he was sworn of the privy council. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 14 July 1778, in time to preside over its prorogation at the end of the session.<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>As lord chancellor Thurlow was meticulous in attending the House of Lords. In his first full session (1778&#150;9) he was present on each of the 121 days of its duration; for the rest of his two terms in that office his level of attendance rarely fell below 90 per cent. His aggressive domination of debate caused the opposition peer Lord Pembroke to write in 1781: &#145;Mon Chancelier is a clever fellow, but his wings must be clipped, or La Chambre Haute had better be shut up&#146;  (G. M. Ditchfield, &#145;The House of Lords in the age of the American revolution&#146;, in <span class="italic">A Pillar of the Constitution: the House of Lords in British Politics, 1640&#150;1784</span>, ed. C. Jones, 1989, 216&#150;17). An early manifestation of his ascendancy was his contemptuous dismissal in March 1779 of the duke of Grafton's sneer at his undistinguished social origins; asserting that &#145;the peerage solicited me, not I the peerage&#146;, he retorted by describing the duke as &#145;the accident of an accident&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;Lord Thurlow&#146;, 66). Thurlow's nicknames in the court of chancery&#151;Tiger, or sometimes Lion&#151;indicate a similar fierceness, although he was recognized to be above any hint of corruption. For all his skill in equity cases, Lord John Campbell, an admittedly hostile whiggish commentator, was exaggerating only slightly when he ascribed delays in chancery to Thurlow's &#145;want of industry and exertion&#146; and observed &#145;he was not patient or pains-taking &hellip; he did little in settling controverted questions or establishing general principles&#146;  (Campbell, 5.521&#150;2, 528). What Campbell called his &#145;awe-inspiring manners&#146; contributed more to his authority than any depth of learning.<br>
<br>Thurlow saw himself primarily as the king's servant rather than as a party man. He remained in office when the remainder of the Bedfordite group, including Gower and Weymouth, resigned from North's ministry in 1779, and he took part in the confidential negotiations to reconstruct the ministry that autumn. He grew increasingly impatient with the indecisiveness of North's ministry in its latter years and irritated some of his colleagues by his reluctance to conceal his impatience. For his part, North complained of Thurlow's indecision: &#145;in the Cabinet he opposed everything&#151;proposed nothing&#151;and decided nothing&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.175). It is true that Thurlow at times spoke out in the Lords against measures which had government approval. Lord Sandwich in 1781 lamented that &#145;The Chancellor has made a Point of opposing most Bills that have lately been brought up to the House of Lords, and has usually been backed by the whole Opposition&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;Lord Thurlow&#146;, 70). On the other hand, allegations that he was secretly planning a coup whereby a Bedfordite would gain control of the ministry were wide of the mark, and on key items, such as the attacks on Sandwich's conduct of the naval war (1779) and Shelburne's attempt to censure the ministry over Ireland and over public expenditure (1780), he was prominent in his loyalty. While he was no pro-Catholic, he accepted the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> introduced by Sir George Savile, with ministerial support, in 1778, and strongly resisted the efforts of the Gordon rioters to secure its repeal two years later. His brother Thomas, by then bishop of Lincoln, narrowly escaped death at the hands of the rioters.<br>
<br>After the defeat at Yorktown, North's ministry lost its majority in the House of Commons (although not in the House of Lords) and Thurlow was one of the king's most trusted advisers as he tried desperately, and unsuccessfully, to avoid the Rockinghamite alternative. When Rockingham formed his second ministry, in coalition with Shelburne, in March 1782, he was reluctantly obliged to retain Thurlow as lord chancellor. It was an uneasy arrangement. Thurlow opposed the ministry's economical reform proposals, notably the <span class="roman">Contractors' Bill</span>, and after Rockingham's death, on 1 July 1782, Thurlow grew rather more at ease in the new ministry headed by Lord Shelburne and purged of most of its Rockinghamites. Although not on close personal terms with Shelburne, and without any illusions that the ministry would last, he gave it loyal support. When in February 1783 Shelburne's ministry was defeated in the House of Commons over the peace preliminaries with America, Thurlow's speeches helped to ensure that Shelburne was not defeated in the Lords. Shelburne none the less resigned, and the king again turned to Thurlow as confidential adviser. On the accession to office six weeks later of the Fox&#150;North coalition, George III contemplated abdication and Thurlow was deprived of the great seal, which was placed in commission. His chagrin was increased by the appointment of his great rival, Alexander Wedderburn, Lord Loughborough, as one of the commissioners.<h2>
<a name="Returntooffice"></a>Return to office</h2>Thurlow stiffened George III's resolve to resist, and, if possible, to overthrow the Fox&#150;North coalition. He alone of the king's leading servants&#151;unlike Grafton, North, and Shelburne&#151;had not deserted him in his hour of need. He was involved in the arrangement whereby the king, via Lord Temple, encouraged members of the House of Lords to vote against the coalition's <span class="roman">India Bill</span> in December 1783 and whereby the younger Pitt would form a ministry following its consequent dismissal. In the debates Thurlow spoke powerfully against the <span class="roman">India Bill</span>, denouncing in particular the proposed transfer of the East India Company's patronage to commissioners nominated by the coalition government. Should the king give the royal assent to the bill, Thurlow declared, he would &#145;take the diadem from his own head, and place it on the head of Mr Fox&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 24.125). On 23 December 1783, four days after Pitt's appointment as prime minister, Thurlow became lord chancellor for the second time. His return to the woolsack gave the insecure new ministry essential leadership in the House of Lords&#151;especially important after Temple's enforced resignation on 22 December. Pitt's ministry, surviving early setbacks in the House of Commons, was secure in the Lords, and in March 1784 Pitt felt sufficiently confident to dissolve parliament. At that moment the great seal was mysteriously stolen from Thurlow's house in Great Ormond Street, an event which, though the subject of much amusement to caricaturists and satirists, had no political consequences. At the ensuing general election Pitt secured a Commons majority of well over one hundred, and Thurlow embarked upon his most harmonious period of high office.<br>
<br>Before Pitt fully established his ministry and became less dependent on the king, Thurlow provided vital ballast. He used all his eloquence to promote ministerial proposals, including those which were unpopular. Of his support for Pitt's Irish trade proposals in 1785 Charles Jenkinson wrote: &#145;In carrying the business through the House of Lords, the chancellor is the most firm and able person that government has, and I can assure you he is very zealous and steady&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 187). In 1788 the archbishop of Canterbury, John Moore, believed that all Thurlow's ill humour must be tolerated, since &#145;without him the House of Lords would be a wretched, insupportable place&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;Lord Thurlow&#146;, 72). The elevation of Thomas Thurlow to the see of Durham in 1787 cemented Thurlow's relationship with his cabinet colleagues. Even his opposition to mild measures of parliamentary reform in the House of Lords and his private criticism of the possibility of military intervention in the Netherlands in 1787 caused no serious friction. Bearing in mind that the ministry was divided over the abolition of the slave trade and never sponsored abolition officially, Thurlow's vehement denunciations of abolition were not inconsistent with cabinet membership.<h2>
<a name="Decliningfortunes"></a>Declining fortunes</h2>The causes of Thurlow's political decline lie in the Regency crisis of 1788&#150;9 and in the impeachment of Warren Hastings. In the former, there is little doubt but that Thurlow was willing to compromise with the opposition, in the event of the king's permanent incapacity or death, in order to retain the great seal (and to deny it to Loughborough). He had a genuine sympathy with the prince of Wales's claim to an immediate regency; later on in his life he became a trusted confidant and adviser to the prince over the latter's debts and unhappy marriage to Princess Caroline. But in 1788&#150;9 the verdict of Sir Gilbert Elliot that &#145;The Chancellor has been the whole of this time playing a shabby trimming game, keeping himself open to both parties till one should be completely victorious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 1.249&#150;50) was uncomfortably accurate. By nominating Lord Grenville to the House of Lords in 1790 Pitt showed that he no longer had confidence in the lord chancellor's reliability. Although Grenville took care to consult Thurlow over important matters of policy, it was not long before the latter began to complain vigorously of neglect by the prime minister. His choleric outbursts and open criticisms of ministerial policy caused his relations with Pitt and Grenville to become increasingly strained. When he strongly (and abusively) attacked the <span class="roman">Sinking Fund Bill</span> in May 1792, Pitt and Grenville presented George III with an ultimatum: either Thurlow was to be dismissed, or Pitt would resign. If this was bluff, George III could not afford to call it, and, after vainly seeking a compromise through the mediation of Henry Dundas, he reluctantly consented to Thurlow's dismissal. This took place at the end of the session, in June 1792, and was sweetened by the grant of the barony of Thurlow of Thurlow, Suffolk, with a special remainder to his nephews; his pension was increased and he retained the tellership of the exchequer, which he had held since 1786. The news was greeted with disbelief, and at least one London newspaper, <span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, predicted his rapid return to office. He remained on friendly, if more distant, terms with George III, who commended his advice to the royal princes.<br>
<br>As lord chancellor Thurlow had presided over the opening years of Warren Hastings's impeachment in Westminster Hall, which began in February 1788. He formed a close personal friendship with Hastings, asserted his innocence, sought to nominate him for a peerage, and worked diligently on his behalf. Following his dismissal from office Thurlow continued to attend the Lords regularly, and he was among the majority of peers who voted for the acquittal of Hastings on 23 April 1795. Although he told his friend Lord Kenyon that he did not wish to waste his breath in a &#145;vain opposition&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;Lord Thurlow&#146;, 76), Thurlow did not hesitate to criticize the policies of his former cabinet colleagues, notably over the restrictive measures of 1794&#150;5. As late as the session of 1801&#150;2 he was present on more than half of the days when the Lords were in session, and he attacked the peace of Amiens. Though his latter years were soured by the elopement of his daughter Caroline, he lacked neither means nor convivial company, encouraging younger lawyers he admired, including the future lord chancellor John Scott, Lord Eldon. He spent much time in spas and seaside resorts. He died at Brighton on 12 September 1806, one day before Charles James Fox, and was buried on 25 September in the Temple Church, London.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Thurlow's physical appearance was impressive. His features were dark and stern, and the ferocity of his demeanour could inspire respect, and sometimes fear. It occasionally gave rise to allegations that he was acting: Fox observed, &#145;It proved him dishonest, since no man could <i>be</i> so wise as Thurlow <i>looked</i>&#146;  (Campbell, 5.661). Many anecdotes surround his profanity of language and his unconcealed neglect of religious observance. As lord chancellor, however, he controlled considerable ecclesiastical patronage; according to <span class="italic">Drewry's Derby Mercury</span> of 2&#150;9 December 1784 he disposed of church livings worth a total of &pound;80,000 per annum. His preference was consistently exercised in favour of clergymen whose theological orthodoxy was not in doubt, and one of his ecclesiastical prot&eacute;g&eacute;s was the ultra-orthodox Samuel Horsley, who became bishop of St David's in 1788. He could be a very loyal friend, personally kind (as to the ageing Samuel Johnson in 1784) and ready to forgive old enmities; one of his close friends in later life was the radical John Horne Tooke, with whom he shared classical and literary interests. Although he was caricatured as an inveterate reactionary in the age of the French Revolution, his opinions were far from predictable. He regarded military intervention in Europe with caution, and his public support for Pitt's bellicose stance towards Russia over Ochakov in 1791 was accompanied by private warnings.<br>
<br>Thurlow exploited his role as an outsider and preferred to stress aggressively, rather than to conceal, his relatively humble origins. Many observers emphasized the intimidatory power, as opposed to the intellectual depth, of his forensic and parliamentary skills. Charles Butler described him as &#145;a kind of guarda costa vessel, which cannot meet every turning and winding of a frigate that assails her, but, when the opportunity offers, pours a broad-side which seldom fails of sinking the assailant&#146;  (Butler, 201). He left no written legacy of legal wisdom; &#145;his way was to decide, not to reason&#146;, opined Lord Brougham  (Brougham, 88). Holdsworth noted his &#145;imperfect mastery of principle&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 12.323) but allowed that he made some contributions to the administration of equity law, notably in the protection of married women from undue pressure from husbands and other interested parties to use their powers of disposition unwisely. Campbell, who heard him speak on a divorce bill in the House of Lords on 20 May 1801, described him as &#145;this great imitator of GARAGANTUA&#146;  (Campbell, 5.476). He was one of the most eminent legal practitioners, if not theorists, of his age, and was the last of the great eighteenth-century lord chancellors.<br>
