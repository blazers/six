<span class="headword">Collins,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1618, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">anatomist and physician</span>, was the only son of John Collins, rector of Rotherfield, Sussex, who was descended from a family long established in Somerset and Devon. He received his education at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected to a scholarship, and afterwards to a fellowship. Collins graduated BA in 1639 and MA in 1642. Then he travelled on the continent and visited many universities in France, Italy, and the Low Countries, but found none to compare with those of his native land. He was created MD at Padua on 25 August 1654, and incorporated in that degree at Oxford on 24 June 1659, and at Cambridge in 1673. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians of London in 1656, and a fellow in 1668. About the latter date Collins was appointed physician-in-ordinary to Charles II. Between 1671 and 1707 he was frequently elected to the office of censor in the College of Physicians; he was anatomy reader in 1684, and on 10 September 1694 was appointed Lumleian lecturer, an office which he retained to his death. He was constituted an elect in 1689, was several times appointed consiliarius, and in 1695 was elected president of the college.<br>
<br>Munk says that Collins, who is mentioned in Samuel Garth's <span class="italic">Dispensary</span>, was an accomplished anatomist, and stood foremost among his contemporaries, whether at home or abroad, in his knowledge of comparative anatomy. His most important work, which contains a full account of his investigations, is his <span class="italic">A systeme of anatomy, treating of the body of man, beasts, birds, fish, insects, and plants. Illustrated with many schemes</span> (2 vols., 1685). It is often referred to by Boerhaave and Haller.<br>
<br>Collins married, first, Ann, eldest daughter of John Bodenham, of Wiltshire, and second, Katherine, dowager countess of Carnwath in Scotland, daughter of John Abington, of Dowdeswell, Gloucestershire. Collins died on 11 April 1710 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. To his memory is inscribed the view of the interior of the nave of St Paul's in Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">History</span> of that church. (The date of 1658 refers to the plate, and not to Collins's death.)<br>
