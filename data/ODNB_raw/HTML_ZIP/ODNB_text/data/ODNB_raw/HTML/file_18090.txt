<span class="headword">Marriott,  Charles</span>  (1811&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college teacher</span>, was born at the rectory, Church Lawford, near Rugby, on 24 August 1811, the third of the five children of the rector of the parish, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18093/', "John Marriott (1780&#150;1825)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1821), the daughter of Thomas and Ann Harris. His father also held the curacy of Broadclyst in Devon, and, on account of his mother's poor health, the family mainly lived there during Marriott's youth. Charles received his elementary education at the village school. Both his parents died while Marriott was still a boy, and he was privately educated at Rugby by his aunts and a private tutor in Shropshire. He was a day pupil at Rugby School in 1825, but his delicate health led to his rapid removal. In March 1829 Marriott entered at Exeter College, Oxford, and in the autumn won an open scholarship at Balliol. George Moberly, afterwards bishop of Salisbury, was his college tutor, and exercised great influence over him. In his undergraduate years Marriott showed great ability and application, and when in Michaelmas term 1832 he took a first class in classics and a second in mathematics, there was some surprise that he had missed a double first. At Easter 1833 he was elected a fellow of Oriel, was ordained deacon, and was at once appointed mathematical lecturer, and afterwards tutor of the college. He took his MA in 1835.<br>
<br>At Oriel Marriott fell under the influence of John Henry Newman, and became his devoted disciple. In February 1839, after spending the winter in southern Europe, he became principal of the Diocesan Theological College at Chichester, at the invitation of Bishop William Otter, and was ordained priest on 19 May, Whitsunday. Although the numbers of students were small, the college was one of the first residential exercises in priestly formation in the Church of England. After two years' conscientious work ill health obliged Marriott to resign: he returned to Oriel and was appointed subdean and later dean of the college, taking his BD in 1848. On Newman's advice he declined Bishop George Augustus Selwyn's invitation to accompany him to New Zealand (1841), though they were to maintain a warm correspondence; his poor health similarly prevented him from joining Newman's community at Littlemore.<br>
<br>Marriott remained a close friend of Newman during the latter's years of increasing alienation from the Church of England, though his confidence in his own position does not appear to have wavered. On Newman's secession in 1845 Marriott to a great extent took Newman's place in Oxford, and increasingly became one of E. B. Pusey's most valuable allies. He had been prominent in the organization of Pusey's defence when the latter was suspended from preaching in 1843; later Pusey sought Marriott's advice on the controversial developments of the late 1840s, including the building of St Saviour's, Leeds, and Priscilla Lydia Sellon's early attempt to establish an Anglican sisterhood. Marriott also provided Pusey with some of the historical information that formed part of his controversial writings. There was, moreover, no doubt about Marriott's unshaken loyalty to the university. He became the correspondent, confessor, and spiritual adviser of many within it, especially young men, and was influential in keeping a large number of Newman's followers in the Church of England in the late 1840s and early 1850s. In 1850 Marriott was appointed vicar of the university church of St Mary the Virgin, which was in the gift of his college. A convinced celibate, he threw himself with his usual thoroughness into his parochial work. When cholera and smallpox broke out in 1854, he fearlessly visited sufferers and caught the latter disease himself. His sermons were always effective, though he was no orator, and it was in personal contact that he made his most profound mark. Edward King, later bishop of Lincoln, wrote: &#145;If I have any good in me, I owe it to Charles Marriott&#146;  (Burgon, 372).<br>
<br>Marriott had an abiding interest in education. He supported Henry Stevens, rector of Bradfield, Berkshire, and his newly founded Bradfield College, and made unsuccessful efforts to establish a hall for poor students in Oxford. He acquired possession of Newman's buildings at Littlemore &#145;partly because I did not wish that he should be embarrassed with them, and that any of his new friends should be led to urge him to put a Roman colony there, which would be no good to them and a great annoyance to us&#146;  (Charles Marriott to Fitzherbert Marriott, [12 April] 1846, Marriott MSS). The buildings were used to house a printing press for religious works, a scheme that caused Marriott endless worry and expenditure, though he grew into the administrative and commercial side of publishing. He also threw himself into a commercial scheme at Oxford, named the Universal Purveyor, an attempt to regulate the quality and price of daily essentials. It was started for the most benevolent purposes, but was quite out of his experience, and became a fruitful source of anxiety. Marriott was at the same time a member of the hebdomadal council, and &#145;took a considerable part in working the new constitution of the university&#146;  (Church, 91). The variety and pressure of his work damaged his health: on 29 June 1855 he suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralysed and hampered his speech. On 23 August he was moved to Bradfield, where he lived with the curate, his devoted brother John, for three years. He died there on 15 September 1858, and was buried in a vault under the south transept of Bradfield parish church on 20 September.<br>
<br>Marriott's reputation was out of all proportion to the number of works published under his name; but much of his most valuable work appeared without acknowledgement of his authorship. In 1843 he published <span class="italic">Sermons Preached before the University and in other Places</span>, in 1849 <span class="italic">Reflections in a Lent Reading of the Epistle to the Romans</span>, and in 1850 <span class="italic">Sermons Preached in Bradfield Church, Oriel College Chapel, and other Places</span>. Besides numerous single sermons, lectures, and pamphlets, he also published <span class="italic">Hints to Devotion</span> (1848). After his death his brother John edited his <span class="italic">Lectures on the Epistle to the Romans</span> (1859), which had been delivered at St Mary's during the last two years of his incumbency; they were the only results of what was intended to be the great work of his life, a commentary on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, which was to be his contribution to a commentary on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> projected by Pusey but never completed. From 1841 to the time of his stroke, Marriott edited the <span class="roman">Library of the Fathers</span> in conjunction with Pusey and Keble. It was Marriott who undertook most of the work: Pusey, in the advertisement to the thirty-ninth volume, while paying a graceful tribute to his departed friend, frankly admitted that &#145;upon Charles Marriott's editorial labours &#145;The Library of the Fathers&#146; had, for some years, wholly depended&#146;  (p. iii). In 1852 Marriott also edited, as part of a series of the original texts of the fathers, Theodoret's <span class="italic">Interpretatio in omnes B. Pauli epistolas</span>, and in May 1855 he became the first editor of the <span class="italic">Literary Churchman</span>, in the first seven numbers of which he wrote at least sixteen articles. He edited, for the use of Chichester students, <span class="italic">Canons of the Apostles</span> (1841) in Greek, with the English version and notes of John Johnson of Cranbrook; <span class="italic">Analecta Christiana</span> (1844&#150;8), patristic readings intended for the use of Bishop Selwyn's ministerial candidates; and four of St Augustine's shorter treatises (1848).<br>
