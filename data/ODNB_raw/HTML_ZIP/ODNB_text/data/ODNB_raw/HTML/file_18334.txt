<span class="headword">Mathias,  Thomas James</span>  (1753/4&#150;1835), <span class="occ">satirist and Italian scholar</span>, was the eldest son of Vincent Mathias (<i>c</i>.1711&#150;1782), sub-treasurer in the queen's household, and his wife, Marianne (1724&#150;1799), daughter of Alured Popple, secretary to the Board of Trade and governor of Bermuda. Mathias's uncle Gabriel was an artist, and held a post in the office of the keeper of the privy purse. Another uncle, James, was a Hamburg merchant, well-known amateur singer, and minor enemy of Mrs Thrale. Mathias's brother George, queen's messenger from 1792, was a long-standing friend of Charlotte Burney, who found him &#145;excessive comical&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Diary</span>, 2.302&#150;12). Andrew, the other brother, became surgeon-extraordinary to the queen. His sister Albinia was (as Mrs Skerrett) the addressee of a poem written in 1805 by Anna Seward. The family lived in Middle Scotland Yard. Mathias once owned a picture of the family by Hogarth.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlywork"></a>Education and early work</h2>Mathias is said to have been educated at Eton College, and he had a strong personal interest in the college; but on his admission as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 2 July 1770, aged sixteen, he was recorded as having come from the Revd Richard Woodeson's school at Kingston upon Thames. He was admitted as a scholar of the college on 26 April 1771 and took an <i>aegrotat</i> degree in 1774. In August 1775, as a middle bachelor, he gained one of the members' prizes (15 guineas) for the best dissertation in Latin prose; in 1776, as a senior bachelor, he took a similar prize. These dissertations were printed and survive in signed copies. In 1776 he was elected as a minor fellow of the college (his Latin letter to Dr Lort about the election is in Nichols, <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span>, 2.676&#150;8); he subsequently became a major fellow. In 1777 he graduated MA and served as third, second, and first sub-lector over the period 1777&#150;80. He became intimate with Spencer Perceval, apparently acting as a kind of private tutor to him. In 1780 he published, anonymously, <span class="italic">An Heroic Epistle to the Rev. R. Watson</span>, ridiculing Watson's hopes of surveying the deserts of Arabia and Tartary; <span class="italic">An Answer to the Heroic Epistle</span> provoked from Mathias a further <span class="italic">Heroic Address in Prose</span> of the same year. In 1781 Mathias published <span class="italic">Runic Odes Imitated from the Norse Tongue</span>, which addressed Icelandic, Ossianic, and Welsh themes &#145;in the manner of Mr. Gray&#146;.<br>
<br>Mathias's father died on 15 June 1782 aged seventy-one, and Mathias left Cambridge to become successively sub-treasurer to the queen, vice-treasurer, and treasurer of the accounts of the queen's household. In 1783, aided by Dr Glynn, who had access to some of Chatterton's manuscripts, Mathias produced a somewhat indeterminate <span class="italic">Essay on the Evidence Relating to the Poems Attributed to Thomas Rowley</span>. The anonymous <span class="italic">Rowley and Chatterton in the Shades</span> (1782), sometimes attributed to Mathias, is probably by George Hardinge. The wide range of Mathias's interests and connections is indicated by his election as fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in January 1795, and fellow of the Royal Society in March 1795. He was &#145;particularly agreeable &amp; pleasant as well as cultivated and sensible&#146; in social circles, according to Fanny Burney, who mentioned that he &#145;can't determine upon matrimony&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney</span>, 3.101, 4.31). (He never did marry.)<h2>
<a name="PursuitsofLiteratureandothersatires"></a>Pursuits of Literature and other satires</h2>Mathias's <span class="italic">Pursuits of Literature, or, What you will</span>, a wide-ranging satire with extensive notes on the conceit and licence of contemporary authors, appeared anonymously in four dialogues, the first on 7 June 1794, the second and third on 14 July 1796, and the fourth on 19 July 1797. The poem was issued as a whole in a &#145;fifth edition revised&#146; in 1798, alongside several editions of a translation of the classical passages quoted in the poem. The attacks on Payne Knight's <span class="italic">Worship of Priapus</span> and Lewis's <span class="italic">The Monk</span> are concerned with obscenity, and Mathias ridicules the &#145;Black-Letter Kennell&#146; of antiquarians (especially George Steevens), W. H. Ireland, Parr, Darwin, and Gilpin, on literary grounds. There is praise for Gray, Mason, Beattie, Burns, Cowper, Ann Radcliffe, Capell, Johnson, Isaac Reed, and Jacob Bryant, as well as for several of Mathias's own works. But the poem is confessedly of its political moment, declaring openly that literature is an important tool of government. Held up for censure are Sheridan, Fox, Priestley, Paine, Horne Tooke, and Godwin. The vehement distrust of Catholics in the poem was also expressed separately in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Lord Marquis of Buckingham</span> (1796).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">British Critic</span> approved of the poem as a &#145;strenuous enemy and assailant of democratical principles, and of that monster, French, or Frenchified philosophy&#146;  (8.353&#150;6). When the fourth part came out, the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> accused Mathias of scaremongering: &#145;our literary Mesmer very successfully magnetizes his readers into a perpetual hysteric, and convulses them with the titillatory spasms of ever-varying fears&#146;  (new ser., 24.219). William Cobbett wrote to the anonymous author that &#145;Your matchless poem &hellip; is become very fashionable in the libraries of the Americans&#146;  (Smith, 1.244&#150;5). Mathias's comments on the French Revolution and on women radicals were enthusiastically endorsed by Richard Polwhele in <span class="italic">The Unsex'd Females</span>, addressed to Mathias in 1798, though this did not prevent Mathias from disparaging Polwhele in a later edition. Steevens's perceptive point that the poem was &#145;merely a peg to hang the notes on&#146; brought a rebuttal in the poem itself  (iv.15). Southey commented &#145;they tell me I am civilly wiped in that stupid poem&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Letters</span>, 1.139). The most successful public response was that by William Boscawen, whose translation of Horace had been censured by Mathias in <span class="italic">Pursuits</span>. His <span class="italic">Progress of Satire: an Essay in Verse</span> (1798) argued that local and topical satire was inferior to general satire and attacked Mathias's arrogance and spite. It was reissued with a supplement in 1799. Reviewers tended to agree with Boscawen. Other responses of 1798 included the anonymous <span class="italic">Impartial Strictures on the Poem called The Pursuits of Literature</span>, which contained a vindication of <span class="italic">The Monk</span>; <span class="italic">The Egotist</span>, which depicted the overweening author quarrelling with his interlocutor; John Mainwaring, <span class="italic">Remarks on &#145;The Pursuits of Literature&#146;</span>, to which Mathias replied in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Author of a Pamphlet, Entitled, Remarks</span>; and Thomas Dutton, <span class="italic">The Literary Census. A Letter to the Executor of the Deceased Author of &#145;The Pursuits of Literature&#146;</span> appeared the following year, and William Burdon's <span class="italic">An Examination of the Merits and Tendency of &#145;The Pursuits of Literature&#146;</span> came out in two parts between 1799 and 1800.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, reviewing Dutton, said that there seemed to be &#145;a train in preparation&#146; for discovering the authorship of the <span class="italic">Pursuits</span>  (7.505&#150;6). Fanny Burney thought it was by Mason, but Farington recorded in November 1797 that the poem was ascribed to Mathias, with help from Dr Rennell and Mansell, the master of Trinity  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.219). Mathias's anonymity was partly removed by &#145;Andrew Oedipus, an injured author&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Sphinx's Head Broken, or, A Poetical Epistle &hellip; to Thomas James M*th**s, Cl*rk to the Q***n's Tr**s*r*r</span> (1798), though the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> was not convinced by the &#145;very angry and scurrilous&#146; pamphlet  (new ser., 25.473) and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> asked for more proofs against the &#145;ingenious and amiable&#146; Mathias  (11.677). Samuel Denne, happy with his mention in the poem, guessed Mathias to be the author  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 6.770). Peter Pindar, another victim, referred to Mathias as &#145;one of the smaller rats of the Queen's Closet&#146; and claimed that he &#145;giveth the little Animal a good Drubbing&#146;  (Pindar, &#145;Argument&#146;). He abused Mathias as &#145;human <i>toad</i>&#146; and descanted on the poem's &#145;enormity of falsehood and impudence&#146;  (note to line 108). Mrs Thrale forgave Mathias her mention in the poem because of his &#145;being a Scholar, and a Christian, and &hellip; a firm Aristocrate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Piozzi Letters</span>, 2.399&#150;401).<br>
<br>Alongside the <span class="italic">Pursuits</span>, Mathias produced a series of conservative topical satires in Popean couplets. <span class="italic">The Political Dramatist</span>, an attack on Sheridan, complete with adulation for Pitt, appeared in 1795 and was reissued with a postscript attacking the declaration of the Whig Club in 1796. <span class="italic">The Imperial Epistle from Kien Long, Emperor of China, to George the Third</span> (1795), using an idea of Peter Pindar, offered a mock invitation to Pitt in a general satire on the state of Europe. In 1796 Mathias also published <span class="italic">An Epistle in Verse to the Rev. Dr Randolph</span> and <span class="italic">An Equestrian Epistle in Verse, to the Right Honourable the Earl of Jersey</span>, both concerned with the embarrassing loss of some private letters of the princess of Wales. <span class="italic">The Grove</span>, a Popean vision of literature and society, was published in 1798, containing &#145;abundant abuse of about some ten dozen of his cotemporary wits&#146; and others  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, new ser., 25.472); the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> said it displayed &#145;the pedantry of a schoolmaster, the vulgarity of a poissard, and the malevolence of a&#151;&#146;  (5.507). <span class="italic">The Shade of Alexander Pope. On the Banks of the Thames</span>, an attack on Henry Grattan, followed in 1799, occasioning a further attack by William Burdon (<span class="italic">A vindication of Pope</span>, 1799), and an anonymous riposte, <span class="italic">An Interview between the Spirit of Pope and the Shade that assumed his Name</span> (1799); Grattan's own lines on the matter appear in Wrangham's <span class="italic">English Library</span> (409&#150;10). <span class="italic">Pandolfo attonito!</span>, a light stanzaic poem about the removal of armchairs from the Opera House, completed Mathias's satiric efforts in 1800.<h2>
<a name="Italianscholarshipandlaterlife"></a>Italian scholarship and later life</h2>Mathias's mother died on 6 January 1799, occasioning a warm tribute, probably by Mathias  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 69, 1799, 82). She left him &pound;3000. Mathias brought out a quarto edition of his <span class="italic">Works</span>, and in 1801 published a selection of items from newspapers, <span class="italic">Prose on Various Occasions, Literary and Political</span>. Thereafter Mathias, who had apparently studied Italian at Cambridge under Agostino Isola, embarked on a series of editions of Italian texts, and translations into Italian. These included <span class="italic">Sonetti de piu illustri poeti d'Italia</span> (1802), critical works by Tiraboschi, Crescimbeni, Menzini, Redi, Monti, and Gravina, an Italian version of Mason's <span class="italic">Saffo</span> (1809), and one of Milton's &#145;Lycidas&#146; (1812). Byron, responding to a letter of praise from Mathias, chided him for being &#145;too much devoted to a foreign Muse&#146; and hoped that &#145;some national <i>Pursuit</i> will enable us once again to claim your muse entirely our own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 2.176).<br>
<br>Mathias became librarian at the queen's house about 1813. He continued to revise <span class="italic">Pursuits</span>, and made many textual changes between the fourteenth edition (1808) and the sixteenth (1812), but the poem still received a mixed reception. Byron called the poetry &#145;the worst written of it's kind&#146; and thought &#145;it's sole merit lies in the Notes, which are indisputably excellent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 2.86&#150;7). De Quincey saw it as marked by &#145;much licence of tongue, much mean and impotent spite, and by a systematic pedantry without parallel in literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">De Quincey's Works</span>, 142). Ireland contrasted its &#145;sea of gall&#146; with the &#145;rivulet narrow of poor praise&#146; in <span class="italic">Scribbleomania</span>  (p. 96). Mathias made peace with Samuel Parr by sending him several of his later works, and Parr kept seventeen of his letters in a bundle marked &#145;MOST PRECIOUS&#146;. Among his numerous other correspondents of this period were Sir Walter Scott, Spencer Perceval, and William Roscoe. Mathias derived considerable knowledge of Thomas Gray from the Revd Norton Nicholls, on whose death in 1807 Mathias composed a letter of eulogy. Mathias was a beneficiary of Nicholls's will. In 1814 he published an edition of <span class="italic">The Works of Thomas Gray</span> in two quarto volumes, with substantial prose extracts from Gray's manuscripts, under the sponsorship of Pembroke College. At 7 guineas it could not compete with the cheap editions by John Mitford and others and it &#145;sank with the weight of lead upon the market&#146;  (Dibdin, 732), causing Mathias some personal loss.<br>
<br>In his official capacity Mathias was responsible for the quarterly payments of Fanny Burney's pension from 1794 until 1816. Burney reported that Mathias suffered an &#145;alarming stroke &amp; attack&#146; in spring 1817 and decamped to Italy for his health  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney</span>, 10.773). Southey met him on the way in Paris in May 1817. He fitted effortlessly into expatriate circles in Rome and Florence before settling in an old palace on the Pizzofalcone in Naples. He received a pension from the Royal Society of Literature, of which he was a royal associate. Some of his books and manuscripts were sold by R. H. Evans in 1820. He produced an edition of <span class="italic">Lyrica sacra, excerpta ex hymnis ecclesiae antiquis</span> (1818), and translated into Italian poems by Akenside (1821), Mason (1823), Armstrong (1824), Beattie (1824), Spenser (1826), and Thomson (1826). He also produced several editions of <span class="italic">Poesie liriche toscane</span> between 1818 and 1825, and revised versions of his lyric poetry. Mathias visited Scott at Naples during his last illness, contributing to his &#145;comfort and amusement&#146; by helping him collect local ballads  (Lockhart, 10.147&#150;8).<br>
<br>Mathias's death at Naples on 20 July 1835 was noted in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (22 August 1835, 650), which printed some recollections, almost certainly by Lady Blessington. According to her, the litterati of Naples bestowed &#145;the warmest eulogiums on the purity and precision&#146; of Mathias's written Italian. He &#145;maintained an independent and respectable station, and was a welcome guest in all the houses occupied by the English residents&#146;. He was &#145;below the middle size, being scarcely taller than Mr. Godwin. In face he bore a striking resemblance to Sir Francis Burdett. He was particularly neat in his attire, and scrupulously clean in his person.&#146; Among other &#145;nervous peculiarities&#146; he had a bizarre dread of getting run over in the street; his attempts to cross the highway were a source of amusement to his acquaintances. He was &#145;a gastronome in the full extent of the word, took a lively interest in the first appearance of green peas, and was a connoisseur of wild boar&#146;. He enjoyed the &#145;cheapness of the luxuries he liked&#146;, and shuddered if anyone mentioned returning to England. &#145;Any allusion to the <span class="italic">Pursuits of Literature</span> was extremely offensive to him&#146;, and he persisted in denying his authorship to the end. Dawson Turner, a friend to whom Mathias wrote over ninety letters and who once owned a volume of letters written to the anonymous author, with some replies by Mathias (now BL, Add. MS 22976), wrote that the authorship &#145;was scarcely made a secret by his family after he went to Italy&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 1st ser., 3.276); but even in 1824 Dibdin was not sure that Mathias was the author. Further anecdotes, from Lady Blessington's <span class="italic">Idler in Italy</span>, were reprinted in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (23 March 1839).<br>
