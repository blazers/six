<span class="headword">Bent, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1838&#150;1909), <span class="occ">premier of Victoria, Australia</span>, born at Penrith in New South Wales on 7 December 1838, was the eldest child of five sons and three daughters of James and Maria (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Toomey) Bent. His father had been transported for housebreaking; his mother was a free immigrant from co. Clare, Ireland. In 1849 the family moved to Fitzroy in the Port Phillip district (later Victoria) where James Bent worked as a contractor and Thomas attended St Mark's Anglican school. Two years later the family moved to Moorabbin where James set up a market garden and Thomas's formal education ended when he left school at the age of thirteen to work with his father. He exhibited his enterprising spirit early on, starting a small market garden in 1859 and taking his produce to market in a rough cart. In 1861 he became rate collector for the district of Brighton.<br>
<br>Bent entered public life in 1863 when he was elected to the Moorabbin Road board district (after 1874 known as the shire of Moorabbin). He entered the Victorian parliament in 1871 when, to general surprise, he defeated the highly respected retiring member, George Higinbotham, for the legislative assembly seat of Brighton. It was subsequently revealed that Bent had used the position of rate collector to stack the electoral rolls. He represented the constituency with one short interval throughout his career. In 1874 he resigned his position as rate collector on being elected to the Brighton borough council. He was thus on both the Brighton and Moorabbin councils and was the district's legislative assembly member (MLA).<br>
<br>From the outset Bent demonstrated that he was a force to be reckoned with, and early in 1880 he was responsible for bringing down the government of Graham Berry. He held the public works portfolio in the short-lived government of James Service (March&#150;August 1880) and in mid-1881 joined the government of Sir Bryan O'Loghlen as minister for railways. His term was characterized by his uninformed interference in the day-to-day running of the railways and by his introduction of a <span class="roman">Railway Construction Bill</span> which the press dubbed the &#145;bribery bill&#146;. It provided for a railway in every electorate and gave Bent considerable power in the house as each member sought to secure the line for his district. O'Loghlen's government lasted until March 1883, when for a time Bent led the opposition; but his temperament was little suited to such a task. In October 1887 he was defeated by one vote as candidate for the office of speaker of the assembly. Almost immediately afterwards he was elected chairman of the first railways' standing committee, and in that capacity for two years did much solid work. In 1892 he was elected speaker, and held the office (for which he had few qualifications) for nearly two years.<br>
<br>Bent was obsessed with real estate and in 1873 began speculating in land. Never one to do things on a small scale, he seriously stretched his resources and by the early 1880s was in severe financial difficulty. No sooner had he recovered than he began again and between 1887 and 1893 was engaged in the &#145;land boom&#146;. At first this brought him a huge fortune, on paper at least; but by 1893 he was all but ruined. His land-booming activities became public, he was thrown out by the electors of Brighton, and from 1894 to 1900 he eked out a living milking cows at Port Fairy. He made two unsuccessful attempts to come back, at South Melbourne in 1896 and at Port Fairy in 1897, before being again elected for Brighton in 1900. This time he used voters' certificates to stack the rolls.<br>
<br>On 10 June 1902 Bent joined William Irvine's ministry as minister for railways and works, and was heavily involved in the great railway strike of May 1903. On Irvine's retirement Bent became premier (February 1904). His ministry lasted over four years, and in that period passed much valuable legislation, but in December 1908, six months after being made KCMG, he failed to survive a vote of no confidence. John Murray became premier and immediately announced a royal commission into the land transactions of Bent's cabinet. He emerged with general credit.<br>
<br>Bent married twice: first, in 1860, Elizabeth Hannah Hall (<i>b</i>. 1839), who died within a year leaving no children. In 1864 he married Elizabeth Huntley (<i>d</i>. 1903). Their first daughter, Elizabeth Hannah (<i>b</i>. 1866), as Elizabeth Bleazby became a Brighton councillor and was one of Victoria's first female councillors. A second daughter, Gertrude Huntley (<i>b</i>. 1868) died in infancy. Bent died on 17 September 1909 at his home, Huntley, Bay Street, Brighton. He was still a councillor for both Moorabbin and Brighton and the MLA for Brighton. After a state funeral on 19 September he was buried at Brighton cemetery.<br>
<br>Rough and uncultivated, shrewd and strong, Bent was certainly an interesting and remarkable figure. His methods were unorthodox, often unprincipled, and, towards the end, quite eccentric; but he had an uncanny ability to sum up others and to turn a situation to advantage.<br>
