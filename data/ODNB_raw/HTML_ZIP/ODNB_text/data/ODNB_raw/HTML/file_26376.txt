<span class="headword">Stephen, Sir  James Fitzjames</span>, first baronet  (1829&#150;1894), <span class="occ">judge and writer</span>, was born on 3 March 1829 at Kensington Gore, London, the second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26374/', "Sir James Stephen (1789&#150;1859)")</script>, colonial under-secretary, and his wife, Jane Catherine Venn (1793&#150;1875). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Leslie Stephen")</script> was his younger brother and biographer.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlycareer"></a>Education, marriage, and early career</h2>Stephen's formal education began at the age of seven at the Revd Benjamin Guest's school, Brighton, followed from April 1842 by three years at Eton College. His parents' discovery of his deep dislike of Eton led to his completing his pre-university education at King's College, London. Here, among the more purposeful offspring of the professional and business middle classes, life was again &#145;most happy&#146;, bringing with it a good measure of academic success. Stephen went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1847, where being one of the &#145;most unteachable of human beings&#146;  (&#145;Autobiographic fragment&#146;, 37&#150;8) ensured an undistinguished BA in classics (1851). Nevertheless, Stephen's powerful, if unscholastic, intellect enjoyed peer recognition through long-remembered appearances at the Cambridge Union, where he became &#145;a terror to the shallow and wordy&#146; and a &#145;merciless exposer of platitudes and shams&#146;: performances which won him the appellation &#145;British Lion&#146;  (Stephen, 98). Intellectual independence and originality coupled with an energetic contempt for all varieties of humbug and wind-baggery gained him election to the exclusive Apostles society. His proposer was the young Henry Maine, recently appointed regius professor of civil law, and thereafter a lifelong close friend of Stephen. Gatherings of the Apostles not only tested intellect but also a young man's nerve and self-confidence. Competitive and combative discussions were fought out to almost legendary levels between Stephen and, particularly, William Harcourt, a future Liberal Party grandee; they were &#145;a pair born for mutual conflict, each equipped with a powerful understanding, vigorous expression and a boldness bordering on arrogance&#146;  (Gardiner, 41).<br>
<br>As a member of the Inner Temple, Stephen was called to the bar in January 1854. Around this period Maine's chambers became a frequent, casual meeting-place for a clutch of fledgeling barristers including Stephen, Harcourt, M. E. Grant Duff, and Frederic Harrison. Unusually for the day, Stephen read for a law degree at London University and for the first time seriously encountered the works of Jeremy Bentham. Despite already being thoroughly familiar with John Stuart Mill's <span class="italic">Logic</span>, Stephen had hitherto lacked an appreciation of utilitarianism's immediate relevance to legal structure and substance as expounded in Bentham's elaborate legislative schemes.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1855 Stephen married Mary Richenda (1829&#150;1912), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6927/', "John William Cunningham")</script>, vicar of Harrow, editor of the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, and a friend of Stephen's father. The marriage produced three sons and at least four daughters surviving to adulthood, but only one grandchild, James Alexander Stephen (1908&#150;1987). The eldest daughter was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48465/', "Katharine Stephen")</script>, later principal of Newnham College, Cambridge. Marriage and the lean pickings of a young barrister combined to boost Stephen's strong attraction towards journalism, which in turn led to his recruitment to the recently established <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. With a coterie of regular contributors, including Maine, Harcourt, Grant-Duff, Goldwin Smith, G. S. Venables, and occasionally G. H. Lewes and Walter Bagehot, the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> rapidly gained a reputation for a unique blend of abrasiveness with a stinging irreverence towards popular heroes and institutions. Its self-assigned mission was to stir up controversy, to focus debate, and broadly to generate the right intellectual and moral climate&#151;goals demanding writers with a rock-solid confidence in their own infallibility. During the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>'s first decade, Stephen contributed more than 300 articles on literature, religion, law, ethics, and history. According to the contemporary critic and editor T. H. S. Escott, &#145;Stephen did not only help make the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. He <i>was</i> the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>&#146;  (Escott, 222).<h2>
<a name="Journalismandlegalwritings"></a>Journalism and legal writings</h2>Stephen's legal career developed at a more moderate pace than his reputation as a journalist and controversialist, partly as a consequence of journalistic diversions but also because of a distaste for the &#145;hardened vulgarity&#146; and &#145;buffoonery&#146; of circuit life. In July 1858 he was appointed secretary to the royal commission on popular education, a post he held until 1861. His reputation, gained through the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, as one well versed in ecclesiastical controversy was, no doubt, a factor in his being sought out to defend the Revd Rowland Williams at his trial in the court of arches (December 1861 and January 1862) for heretical contributions to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860). Not only did Stephen's legal career benefit from the exposure given by the case's public prominence, but the work also spawned his rapidly executed <span class="italic">Defence of the Reverend Rowland Williams</span> (1862). During this period Stephen's determined rationalism made him increasingly ill at ease with established religion and, latterly, particularly with Newmanism. In trenchantly unravelling the nature of John Henry Newman's system of reasoning set out in the latter's <span class="italic">Apologia</span> (1864) and <span class="italic">Grammar of Assent</span> (1870), Stephen also peeled away the dead or dying layers of his own religious convictions. Along with Frederic Harrison, Herbert Spencer, John Morley, Thomas Huxley, and his own brother Leslie, he penned a steady flow of articles in which religious scepticism led into agnosticism, initially in the columns of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> and <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and later in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>. The substance of his participation in the debates of the illustrious <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45584', "Metaphysical Society")</script> during the 1870s placed Stephen firmly on the agnostic benches alongside the likes of T. H. Huxley, W. K. Clifford, and other &#145;scientifics&#146;.<br>
<br>Stephen's publication of his <span class="italic">General View of the Criminal Law</span> in 1863 established him as a legal commentator of considerable originality. Earlier articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, along with a <span class="italic">Cambridge Essay</span>, had already shown Stephen's particular interest in criminal law theory. The <span class="italic">General View</span> was a pioneering attempt to analyse not merely the nature and relationship of the principal theoretical elements of criminal law but also to emphasize the wider social scientific setting in which law might be advantageously studied. It was an approach in which the influences of Bentham, Austin, and Mill were evident rather than dominant. In the manner of Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, the <span class="italic">General View</span> was written not only for lawyers but for any interested observer of society. Yet although he was enjoying a rising reputation as an advocate, the more prominent features of Stephen's professional life were of an irregular nature. Much in the quirky vein of his earlier representation of Rowland Williams, Stephen's most visible professional role of the mid- and late 1860s came through his brief from Mill's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42293', "&#145;Jamaica committee&#146;")</script> in its attempted prosecution of Governor Eyre for murder in the course of his brutal quelling of a Jamaican riot, which had culminated in mass executions.<br>
<br>Throughout this period journalism continued to run in parallel with Stephen's legal career. His opportune good fortune in being in at the founding of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> was repeated with the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, first published in 1865. The <span class="italic">Gazette</span>'s initial team of regular writers was as formidable as that of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. In addition to Stephen (the most frequent contributor over the first five years), the &#145;heavy guns&#146; were Maine, R. H. Hutton, Harrison, G. H. Lewes, and Matthew Higgins, while occasional contributors included George Eliot, Charles Kingsley, Anthony Trollope, Leslie Stephen, Matthew Arnold, and J. A. Froude, by then a close friend of Stephen. During the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>'s first four years, Stephen maintained a phenomenally high journalistic output. In addition to cultivating his bar practice and publishing legal and other occasional magazine contributions, he produced over 800 leading articles and nearly 200 notes for the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>. Echoing Escott's verdict on the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, in its early years Stephen &#145;<i>was</i> the <span class="roman">Pall Mall Gazette</span>&#146;, according to Sir Courtenay Ilbert.<h2>
<a name="StepheninIndia"></a>Stephen in India</h2>Stephen's devotion to journalism was not only a consequence of its intrinsic appeal and financial rewards, it was also a necessary intellectual diversion from the path of a conventional legal career. Though the normal signposts of professional advancement soon appeared, with the recordership of Newark in 1859 and the taking of silk in 1868, Stephen became increasingly occupied by a strong desire for something of greater substance and more enduring significance than circuit life. Early in 1869 he failed to secure election to the Whewell chair of international law at Cambridge, victory going to his old rival, William Harcourt. However, in the summer of that year he was appointed legal member of the Indian viceroy's council on the recommendation of Maine, the retiring holder of that post. The prospect of succeeding men of the standing of Macaulay and Maine, coupled with the opportunity of shaping the legislative future of the subcontinent, proved irresistible. Stephen was in India from December 1869 until April 1872. He piloted through three legislative provisions of considerable importance&#151;the <span class="roman">Evidence Act</span>, the <span class="roman">Contract Act</span>, and a revised code of criminal procedure&#151;along with a very substantial cluster of other enactments, each unselfconsciously embodying European juristic and moral notions, and organized in a fashion manifesting Benthamite influence. According to a later occupant of the post, Stephen &#145;left the Legislative Council breathless and staggering, conscious that they had accomplished unprecedented labours&#146;  (Ilbert, 222, 224). Although Stephen attracted a degree of justified criticism for an &#145;impatience with technicalities&#146; and sometimes failing to round off &#145;raw edges&#146;, the legislation proved workable and durable. Stephen retained an interest and involvement in India which endured throughout the remainder of his life, sustained by his intimacy with high-ranking Anglo-Indian officials, and particularly through a close friendship with Lord Lytton, viceroy from 1876 to 1880. To the end, Stephen remained among the staunchest supporters of a high-minded, visionary form of colonial domination which was later vigorously espoused by Lord Curzon. Many years earlier, at Eton, Curzon had been mesmerized by the literary society's guest speaker on India: &#145;a vivid recollection [of] the vast head, the heavy pendulous jaw, the long and curling locks of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen as he stood at the desk&#146;  (Coleridge, 225).<h2>
<a name="PartingfromJSMill"></a>Parting from J. S. Mill</h2>Stephen's passage home from India was largely taken up with rereading and rethinking Mill's essays <span class="italic">On Liberty</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">Utilitarianism</span> (1863) in preparation for a series of articles initially appearing in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and soon after published as <span class="italic">Liberty, Equality, Fraternity</span> (1873), a work regarded by John Morley, Mill's intellectual lieutenant, as the &#145;first effective attack on Mill's pontifical authority&#146;  (Morley, 55). Yet Stephen's critique manifests a strong adherence to much Millite social philosophy and to utilitarianism, though of a cruder Benthamite hue. The fundamental parting of company from Mill occurred in the area of practical deductions for the mechanisms of social and political government. Essentially, Stephen viewed the democratization of the political process as dangerously misguided because it rested on inappropriate social sentiments and was set against the compelling utility of recognizing the patently plain differences and abilities of society's social strata. In August 1873 he came last in the polls as one of three Liberal candidates contesting the parliamentary seat of Dundee.<h2>
<a name="Legalreform"></a>Legal reform</h2>Stephen's Indian codification experiences heightened a long-standing inclination, partly fuelled by the works of Bentham and Austin, to recast English criminal law in a codified form. Indeed, Stephen maintained that &#145;to compare [Macaulay's] Indian penal code with English criminal law is like comparing cosmos with chaos&#146;  (address to the Social Science Association, Nov 1872). For the remainder of the 1870s Stephen's professional energies were largely engaged in codificatory enterprises. Restructuring the law's form would, Stephen believed, go beyond simply enhancing certainty; more importantly it would facilitate substantive developments and refinements. Stephen's experiences with two abortive bills (evidence, 1872, and homicide, 1872/1874) convinced him that he himself could provide some of the necessary initial impetus for statutory reforms. This was at least part of his motivation in producing his digests on evidence (1876) and criminal law (1877), for he hoped that these might serve as the basis of codifying measures, as well as enhance his reputation as a legal draftsman and writer. Their publication was followed by Stephen's proposals for a full-scale draft criminal code; these were taken up by Lord Chancellor Cairns in August 1877, and eventually referred to a specially established commission composed of Lord Blackburn, Mr Justice Barry, Lord Justice Lush, and Stephen. The code bill was ultimately lost in April 1880, primarily through a combination of a government change and the implacable public hostility of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn.<h2>
<a name="HighCourtjudge"></a>High Court judge</h2>In recognition of his service to the cause of law reform and particularly to codification work, Stephen was appointed to a High Court judgeship in January 1879, a position he had for some time coveted as offering the unmatched combination of professional standing, financial security, and the opportunity to appease his ever-present literary cravings. Stephen was particularly anxious to complete his most extensive and exhausting work, <span class="italic">The History of the Criminal Law</span> (1883). Ranging over the origins, growth, and development of the criminal law, courts' structure, punishment, and procedures, the <span class="italic">History</span> was of considerable originality and a great advance on anything of a similar nature previously produced. His treatment of the substance and relationship of the elemental requirements of criminal responsibility, along with the function of punishment, was unrivalled. Although in some respects deficient judged by later techniques of historical scholarship, the <span class="italic">History</span> has endured as a standard work of authority and reference for both lawyers and theorists. Together, the <span class="italic">History</span> and <span class="italic">General View</span> established Stephen as the nineteenth century's most significant contributor to the conceptualization and exposition of English criminal law.<br>
<br>In contrast, Stephen's thirteen years on the bench were unimpressive when put alongside his intellectual vigour and achievement in other fields: a measurable shortfall existed between expectations and outcome. Yet Stephen's failure as a judge was relative rather than absolute. As a judge he produced a very respectable collection of criminal first-instance and appeal judgments, whose analytical quality was, when compared with those delivered by contemporary members of the bench, of a relatively high order. Yet when measured against a broader span of significant instances of judicial creativity beyond criminal law, none of Stephen's contributions could be regarded as of fundamental conceptual importance. Undoubtedly, his low boredom threshold with the intricacies of procedure and the laborious sifting of evidence took its toll, as did the powerful diverting pull of literary pursuits.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Stephen's closing years were marred first by physical and then steady mental decline following illness in 1885. Despite largely unwarranted suggestions of unfairness and bias in relation to the murder trials of Lipski (1887) and Maybrick (1889), Stephen continued performing his judicial duties until 1891. He also produced <span class="italic">The Story of Nuncomar and Sir Elijah Impey</span> (1885), the second edition of the <span class="italic">General View</span> (1890), and a collection of earlier <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> articles, published as <span class="italic">Horae sabbaticae</span> (1892). However, by early 1891 his declining capacity to exercise judicial functions had properly become a matter of press comment, and following medical advice Stephen resigned in April of that year. Yet even during his final days on the bench, Stephen is reported to have been &#145;brief, terse and to the point, and as lucid as in the old days&#146;; having lost his intellectual stamina, however, &#145;as the hours wore on his voice dropped almost to a whisper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Times</span>, 370). He died of chronic renal failure on 11 March 1894 at Red House Park, a nursing home near Ipswich, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. His wife survived him. Stephen's principal honours were a knighthood (KCSI), in January 1877, and the award of a baronetcy on his retirement from the bench. Academic distinctions included honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, honorary doctorates from Oxford (1878) and Edinburgh University (1884), an honorary fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge (1885), and election to the position of &#145;corresponding member&#146; of the Institut de France (1888).<br>
<br>In describing Stephen as &#145;the last of the Benthamites&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s obituarist was accurate in respect of Stephen's almost irresistible tendency to confront opposing notions of thought in a head-on, unflinching, and sometimes unsubtle fashion. Like Bentham, Stephen held many moral and intellectual beliefs which, even when they were unassailable, were often too cleanly stripped of irreducible human foibles to make their straightforward social application anything other than illusory. With this was coupled a distinctly jaundiced view of democratic institutions which he shared with Carlyle, his long-standing close friend and, in some senses, spiritual mentor. Yet, unlike Carlyle, any misanthropic streak in Stephen was firmly checked by a powerful personal optimism which had ensured a more direct and formative engagement with the passing events of the age. No distillation of him can be bettered than that of Lytton Strachey, whose first-hand observation suggested that Stephen &#145;preponderated with a character of formidable grandeur, with a massive and rugged intellectual sanity and colossal commonsense&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Stephenssons"></a>Stephen's sons</h2>Stephen's three sons all became lawyers. The eldest, Herbert Stephen (1857&#150;1932), who succeeded to the baronetcy, was an authority on criminal law and practice. Harry Lushington Stephen (1860&#150;1945), the third son, was judge of the high court of Calcutta (1901&#150;14) and was knighted in 1913; he later succeeded his eldest brother as third baronet. <a name="cosubject_26376"></a><span class="headword">James Kenneth Stephen</span>  (1859&#150;1892)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son, was born on 25 February 1859. Educated at William Browning's School, Thorpe Mandeville, until 1871, and then at Eton, where he showed legendary prowess at the wall game, he gained a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, in 1878; this was followed by election to a fellowship in 1885. Like his father, he enjoyed both recognition as an Apostle and a high reputation as a speaker at the union, of which he became president in 1880. The same year he was admitted at the Inner Temple, and he was called to the bar in 1885. In 1889 he became clerk of assize on the south Wales circuit in succession to Henry Maine's recently deceased son. However, literary and journalistic interests increasingly absorbed his attention, with contributions to the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. At the same time the effects of a severe blow to the head, sustained in 1886 from a windmill-driven water-pump, were becoming steadily more evident in frequent periods of violent excitement and depression. In April 1891 it appears that Lord Lytton, then British ambassador in Paris, intervened to secure his release from police custody. Stephen returned to live in Cambridge in the spring of that year, successfully lecturing on constitutional history and speaking at the union. In his pamphlet <span class="italic">Living Languages</span> (1891), he defended Greek as a compulsory element of the Cambridge entrance and degree examinations, and in the same year he also published two volumes of verse, the much admired <span class="italic">Lapsus calami</span> and <span class="italic">Quo musa tendis?</span> The former went through five editions and was later jointly republished with the latter as <span class="italic">Lapsus calami and other Verses</span> (1896) by his brother Herbert. James Kenneth Stephen died at St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, on 3 February 1892 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
