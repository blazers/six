<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Post, Sir  Laurens Jan  van der</span>  (1906&#150;1996), <span class="occ">writer and conservationist</span>, was born on 13 December 1906 at Philipolis in the Orange River Colony, the fifth son and thirteenth of fifteen children of Christiaan Willem Hendrik van der Post (1856&#150;1914), lawyer and politician, known as CWH. His father, of Dutch stock, had arrived in South Africa at the age of three from Leiden in the Netherlands, and in 1885 married Johanna, the elder daughter of Andries Lubbe, of mainly German ancestry, and his wife Elizabeth Liebenberg, whose typical Afrikaner mixture of French, Dutch, and Scandinavian descent also included a seventeenth-century &#145;Hottentot princess&#146;, Eva, possibly of bushman (San) origin, who married an early Dutch settler, Pieter van Meerhoff. After Johanna's death in 1888, leaving one child, CWH in 1889 married her younger sister Maria-Magdalena (Lammie), with whom he had fourteen more. He fought against the British in the South African War, and was exiled to Stellenbosch in Cape Province, where Laurens was conceived in 1906. The family returned home to the small town of Philipolis in the Orange River Colony and there Laurens (originally Lourens in Afrikaans) was born.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Van der Post's childhood was spent in Philipolis and on family farms at Wolwekop and Boesmansfontein. He became an avid reader of classic European literature, from Homer to Shakespeare, and in later life liked to recall how he had retreated with books from his father's extensive library to the branches of a huge mulberry tree. Among other vivid childhood memories was that of being shown the two famous comets of 1910 by his father, who died in August 1914. In 1918 van der Post was sent for a year to Grey College, Bloemfontein, to which he returned for the last two years of his education until he was eighteen. In March 1925 he took his first job as a trainee reporter on the <span class="italic">Natal Advertiser</span> in the busy port of Durban. His duties included acting as the shipping and hockey correspondent, reporting on his own feats as a player for the Durban and Natal hockey teams. In 1926 he joined two already well-known writers, Roy Campbell and William Plomer, who had launched a short-lived satirical magazine, <span class="italic">Voorslag</span>, intended to promote a multiracial South African culture. In the same year he spent three months sailing to Tokyo and back on a Japanese freighter, the <i>Canada Maru</i>, with Plomer, and this introduction to a still largely traditional Japan later inspired books by both writers.<br>
<br>In 1927 van der Post met Marjorie Edith Wendt (<i>d</i>. 1995), daughter of Theo Frederick Charles Otto Wendt, the founder and conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra. Early in 1928 he joined her in England, and on 8 March they were married in Bridport, Dorset. Their son Jan Laurens, later known as John, was born on 26 December. In 1929 van der Post went back to Cape Town, to write for the <span class="italic">Cape Times</span> under the editorship of Desmond Young. In 1931 he returned to England, where he spent some time in London, establishing friendships with members of the Bloomsbury group such as Arthur Waley, J. M. Keynes, E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, and her husband, Leonard, whose Hogarth Press in 1934 published van der Post's first novel, <span class="italic">In a Province</span>, an early attempt to portray the tragic contradictions of a racially divided South Africa. The same year he set up as a dairy farmer at Colley Farm, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, where for five years he attempted to juggle the needs of his cows with visits to London to contribute as an occasional correspondent to various South African newspapers. It was a dark phase of his life, in which his sense of Europe's drift towards war echoed his own lack of personal focus. In 1936 he made five voyages to South Africa, on one trip meeting and falling in love with Ingaret Stella Giffard-Young, known as Ingaret Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1997), an English would-be writer and actress five years his senior, who was already married to Gordon Arthur James Giffard-Young. Later that year Marjorie gave birth to a daughter, Lucia, and in 1938 van der Post sent his wife and two children back to South Africa. By the start of the war, torn between his family and his new love, with his career going nowhere, he was lost and dispirited. Only in the next few years was he to &#145;find himself&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Warservice"></a>War service</h2>In May 1940 van der Post volunteered to join the army. After officer training he was transferred in January 1941 to the intelligence corps as acting captain and posted to east Africa, to join General Wingate's &#145;Gideon force&#146; in a bid to restore the emperor Haile Selassie to his throne in Abyssinia. His own unit's task involved leading 11,000 camels over hazardous terrain, and fellow officers recalled how expertly he cared for his animals. In March he was invalided out with malaria and, after time in Palestine, he was, as a Dutch speaker, posted in early 1942 to the Dutch East Indies. As acting lieutenant-colonel he was placed in command of special mission 43, to organize an allied retreat after the Japanese invasion of Java. On 20 April he was captured and taken first to Soekaboemi camp, where he met Wing Commander W. T. H. Nichols, then to Bandoeng where, with Nichols and an Australian surgeon, Edward &#145;Weary&#146; Dunlop, he played a heroic role in sustaining the morale of hundreds of prisoners of war of several nationalities, by his courage and tireless care for the needs of others. They organized a &#145;camp university&#146;, providing courses in every subject from basic literacy to degree-standard ancient history. Van der Post ran a camp farm to supplement their pitiful rations. In 1945, as the war approached its end, there were warnings that all prisoners would be killed and, in an episode he was later to describe in <span class="italic">The Night of the New Moon</span> (1970), they were saved only by the dropping of the atomic bombs and Japan's surrender.<br>
<br>As his fellow prisoners left for home, van der Post remained on Java, which had been placed under British responsibility by Mountbatten's south-east Asia command, as GSO1 (political) to the British headquarters staff. On 15 September he joined Admiral William Patterson on the cruiser HMS <i>Cumberland</i> to receive the Japanese surrender, and for two years he played an important role in attempting to mediate between Indonesian nationalists and representatives of the discredited Dutch colonial regime. Trusted by nationalist leaders, such as Mohammad Hatta and Ahmed Sukarno, he warned both Mountbatten and the prime minister, Clement Attlee, whom he met in London in October 1945, that the country was a powder keg. Attlee sent him to The Hague to repeat his warning directly to the Dutch cabinet. In November 1946, when British forces withdrew, he became military attach&eacute; to the British consulate in Batavia, but after his return to England in 1947 his fears were borne out, as Indonesia collapsed into the civil war which led to independence. He retired from the army and was made a CBE the same year.<h2>
<a name="Writer"></a>Writer</h2>In 1948 van der Post returned to South Africa, as assistant editor on the <span class="italic">Natal Daily News</span>, but when the election victory of Malan's National Party ushered in apartheid he came back to London. In May 1949 he was commissioned by the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) to survey the Nyika and Mlanje areas of Nyasaland for their agricultural potential. On 13 October, having been divorced from Marjorie, he married Ingaret Giffard (the daughter of Hardinge Frank Giff, barrister) and, on honeymoon in Switzerland, where his new wife introduced him to the psychologist Carl Jung, he completed a book about his Nyasaland trip, <span class="italic">Venture to the Interior</span>. In 1950 he was asked by Lord Reith, head of the CDC, to organize an expedition to Bechuanaland, led by Frank Debenham, to assess the potential of the remote Kalahari desert for cattle ranching. He then for the first time met hunter-gathering bushman (San) inhabitants of the central Kalahari, as he did again in 1952 during a second expedition to complete plans to set up a cattle industry. In the same year <span class="italic">Venture to the Interior</span> was finally published, becoming an instant best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1954 his novel <span class="italic">Flamingo Feather</span>, a Buchanesque thriller about a Soviet plot to take over South Africa, also sold well. In 1955 the BBC commissioned him to return to the Kalahari in search of the bushmen, for what in 1956 became a hugely successful television series. This was followed in 1958 by the most famous of all his books, <span class="italic">The Lost World of the Kalahari</span>, and in 1961 by <span class="italic">The Heart of the Hunter</span>, drawing on a nineteenth-century collection of bushman stories by Wilhelm Bleek. Van der Post's evocation of the bushmen as the first human inhabitants of southern Africa, persecuted by all the races that had arrived subsequently, and now representing the &#145;lost soul&#146; of civilized modern man, encouraged the colonial government to set up the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in 1961 to guarantee their survival. This was to be confirmed by the constitution when in 1966 Bechuanaland was given independence as Botswana.<br>
<br>Van der Post's now secure fame as a writer resulted in a steady succession of books over the next decade, including two on his wartime prison-camp experiences, <span class="italic">The Seed and the Sower</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">The Night of the New Moon</span> (1970). He received lucrative commissions for more general travel writing, including <span class="italic">A Journey into Russia</span> (1964), describing a lengthy trip through the Soviet Union. In 1972 another BBC television series based on his friendship with Jung, who had died in 1961, was followed by the book <span class="italic">Jung and the Story of our Time</span> (1976). During this time of success he moved in 1969 into the penthouse flat at the top of Chelsea Towers, a 1960s block off the King's Road commanding a view over London, where he and Ingaret spent the rest of their lives. They also in 1970 moved into Turnstones, a modern house looking out on the North Sea at Aldeburgh, Suffolk, where Ingaret had long owned a cottage, and where he wrote in a wooden coastguard tower on the seafront and played tennis with a circle of friends centring upon Benjamin Britten.<br>
<br>It was through Suffolk friends that van der Post was introduced to Prince Charles, whom he took on a safari to Kenya in 1977 and with whom he enjoyed a close and influential friendship for the rest of his life. In the same year&#151;with another close friend, Dr Ian Player, a prominent South African conservationist&#151;he set up the first World Wilderness Congress at Johannesburg, launching what became an international movement to promote the spiritual value to mankind of preserving the world's fast diminishing areas of wilderness. After 1979, when his friend and Chelsea neighbour Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, she valued his advice, notably on the politics of southern Africa, beginning with the Rhodesia settlement of 1979&#150;80, and in 1981 he was given a knighthood.<br>
<br>In 1982, when a bad fall injured his back, ending his tennis and skiing, van der Post published an autobiographical book <span class="italic">Yet being someone other</span>, centred on his long-standing love of the sea and his journey to Japan in 1926. But his accounts of having taken part in whaling expeditions were later questioned as fanciful, and from now on his writings, which because of failing health had to be dictated, became infrequent. Ingaret was now entering a twilight of dementia, and he valued the time he was able to spend with a long-standing friend, Frances Baruch. In 1984 his son John died, having made a successful life in England as an engineer, but van der Post continued to enjoy a close relationship with his daughter Lucia and her family. Despite scarcely knowing her father as a child, she had also come to settle in London, to become a respected journalist.<br>
<br>Despite the tribulations of age, van der Post never ceased to throw himself into projects of all kinds, from promoting the worldwide wilderness movement and other conservationist causes to setting up a centre of Jungian studies in Cape Town. To the end of his life he was a spellbinding speaker and storyteller, whether to vast audiences in many countries or to a single friend. As South Africa moved towards black emancipation, his fears of a one-party, Xhosa-dominated state and his friendship with the Zulu leader Chief Buthelezi led him to campaign behind the scenes for a federal constitution which might give a voice to all the country's different racial and tribal groups.<br>
<br>In 1996, in his ninetieth year, van der Post did what he could to avert a final tragedy threatening the Kalahari bushmen, when they were threatened by the Botswanan government with eviction from the reserve that had been set up to ensure their survival. Ironically part of their downfall lay in the consequences of the cattle ranching he had helped to promote nearly half a century before. In October he published his last book, <span class="italic">The Admiral's Baby</span>, describing his time in Java after the war. He was rapturously received by huge audiences at a five-day celebration of his work in Colorado, and returned for a ninetieth birthday party attended by friends from almost every period of his life. Next day he took to his bed and on 16 December 1996, after murmuring in Afrikaans of &#145;die sterre&#146;, the stars of the veld where he grew up, he died. His funeral at Christ Church, Chelsea, on 20 December was attended by Prince Charles. At his memorial service in 1997 Lady Thatcher and his daughter Lucia Crichton-Miller read lessons, and addresses were given by Ian Player and Chief Buthelezi, representing South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela. His ashes were buried in a special memorial garden at Philipolis on 4 April 1998. Ingaret died five months after him, on 5 May 1997. A bronze bust of van der Post by Frances Baruch was placed in Prince Charles's garden at Highgrove, only a mile or two from the Cotswold farm he had run in the 1930s.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>After van der Post's death various journalists rushed to discredit him, not least by revealing the story of how in 1952 he had fathered a child on a fourteen-year-old girl who had been entrusted to his care on a sea voyage to England by her South African family. He was ridiculed for his role as a &#145;modern sage&#146; and &#145;guru to Prince Charles&#146;, and journalists delighted in tracking down examples of how, in writing about his life, he had sometimes blurred fact with fiction. This process culminated in 2001 in a biography, <span class="italic">Storyteller</span>, by J. D. F. Jones, which, highly unusually for an &#145;authorized&#146; biography, presented its subject in an almost unrelievedly negative light. In so far as the book shed light on the darker side of van der Post's life and in particular on his tendency to mythologize, it served a useful purpose. But not even this bleakly critical and not always factually reliable account could conceal the heroic part van der Post had played in the Javanese prisoner-of-war camps, testified to by many survivors. Above all the book failed to understand why van der Post's writings on the bushmen, wildlife, Africa, and the human spirit had struck such a chord with millions of readers. He was indeed in the best sense a storyteller, opening the door to a spiritual dimension of which the modern world is starved.<br>
