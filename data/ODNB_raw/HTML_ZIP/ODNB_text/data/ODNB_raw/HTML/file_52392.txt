<span class="headword">Hurlbatt,  Ethel</span>  (1866&#150;1934), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Bickley, Bromley, Kent, on 1 July 1866, one of seven children of Charles Hurlbatt, mining engineer, and his wife, Sophia Margaret Smith. She was educated at Minshall House, Beckenham, and at a private school in Bromley. She studied modern history at Somerville College, Oxford, between 1888 and 1892, gaining a second in 1891. She stayed on in Oxford for another year as a student, during which time she also started work calendaring medieval charters and rolls for the Bodleian Library. Her BA and MA were conferred upon her by Trinity College, Dublin, in 1905, and she received an honorary MA from Oxford University in 1925.<br>
<br>In 1892 Ethel Hurlbatt became principal of Aberdare Hall, the residence for women students at Cardiff University College. During the next six years, as well as running Aberdare Hall, she was a member of the committee of the Training School of Cookery and Domestic Arts, Cardiff; she was a governor of Howell's School, Llandaff, and honorary secretary of the South Wales Association for Promoting the Education of Women in Wales.<br>
<br>Ethel Hurlbatt became principal of Bedford College, London, in 1898. She also taught economics at the college. During her period as principal, the college became one of the recognized schools of London University, and she became a member of the college council and all college committees. Her time at Bedford left her with many happy memories, but it took its toll on her health. Though in appearance robust, she suffered all her life from what her obituarist Susan Vaughan referred to as &#145;certain constitutional weaknesses, especially in the nervous system&#146;. She was forced to take extended leave before resigning in 1906.<br>
<br>In 1907 Ethel Hurlbatt began work as warden of Royal Victoria College, the women's college in McGill University in Montreal, having travelled to Canada with the founder of the college, Lord Strathcona. She remained in this post until her retirement in 1929. As warden of the college she promoted the study of the French language, and the French government showed their gratitude for her services to education in Montreal during the First World War by appointing her <i>officier de l'instruction publique</i> in 1918. The Serbian government also acknowledged her war work by awarding her the cross of mercy. Illness continued to affect her work, and she was admitted to hospital in 1928. When she retired she was presented with $2000 which had been raised by the Alumnae Society of Royal Victoria College to fund the travels designed to restore her to good health. Her service to the college was further recognized in 1930 when she received an honorary LLD from McGill University. After her death the Alumnae Society paid tribute to her by establishing the Ethel Hurlbatt scholarship.<br>
<br>Ethel Hurlbatt's commitment to the higher education of women and to the place of women's colleges within universities was unwavering. She believed that women's colleges should make every effort to conserve their early records, and hence their history. She acknowledged that she had &#145;done something near&#146;  (Hurlbatt) to pioneering work in women's education; but Susan Vaughan noted that she did not generally hold radical political views, and was not a rebel, giving her allegiance to long-established institutions . During her retirement Ethel Hurlbatt travelled widely, and pursued her interest in sketching. She spent her last days in Tours in France, where she enrolled as a pupil at the Institute de Touraine. She was a tall, imposing figure whose presence commanded attention and respect among her students at Royal Victoria College. She suffered a series of heart attacks, complicated by influenza, in the year before she died. Ethel Hurlbatt died peacefully in her sleep at Tours on 22 March 1934. Her sister, <a name="cosubject_52392"></a><span class="headword">Kate Hurlbatt</span>  (1865&#150;1957), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 24 March 1865. She attended Somerville College, Oxford, from 1884 to 1887 as a clothworkers' scholar, gaining a pass in the university examination for women in 1886. She undertook teacher training at Somerville for two terms, and went on to become a governess for several families, and assistant mistress at St John's College for Girls in St Leonards and at Wimbledon high school. She was lady superintendent of Queen Margaret Hall at Glasgow University from 1895 to 1897. In 1898 she succeeded her sister as principal of Aberdare Hall, a position she held until her retirement in 1934. Her contribution to the higher education of women in Wales was recognized when she was awarded an honorary MA from the University of Wales in 1933. Like her sister she remained unmarried. Kate Hurlbatt died at the General Hospital in Monmouth on 17 January 1957.<br>
