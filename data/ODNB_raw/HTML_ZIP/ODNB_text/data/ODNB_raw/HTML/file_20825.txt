<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Phillip McHugh</span>  (<em>b. </em>1599, <em>d.</em> in or after 1664), <span class="occ">Irish rebel</span>, was the second son of Hugh O'Reilly of Ballynacargy in co. Cavan, chief of the O'Reillys, and Katherine Mac Mahon, a sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17686/', "Hugh Mac Mahon")</script>. His father had supported the English during the Nine Years' War and received land under the Ulster plantation. Despite being a younger son, Phillip succeeded to the family lands upon his father's death in 1629 and to the chieftainship of the O'Reillys in 1635. He was a commissioner of the peace for Cavan in 1625, sheriff of Cavan in 1629, and was elected MP for co. Cavan in 1640. Although he sat on the committee which drew up charges against leading government ministers in February 1641, he did not play a prominent role in the opposition to the government within the Irish parliament. <br>
<br>Indeed that very month O'Reilly met with other leading Gaelic landowners Rory O'More, Rory, Lord Maguire, Turlough O'Neill, and Colonel Brian McMahon to discuss plans to rebel against the government. The conspirators were alarmed by the anti-Catholic rhetoric emanating from the English parliament and hoped to take advantage of the political deadlock in England between the king and parliament. O'Reilly played a key role in the preparations for the rebellion owing to his connections with exiled Irish on the continent. By 1628 he had married Rose, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20783/', "Owen Roe O'Neill")</script>, commander of the Irish regiment in the Spanish Netherlands. O'Reilly was in constant contact with O'Neill during summer 1641. The plotters originally planned to act in concert with Old English Catholic officers in the Irish army. However, by the start of September the Old English officers had cancelled their plans. Undeterred, the Gaelic plotters decided to go ahead with their rebellion on 21 October 1641, which would involve the seizure of Dublin Castle and of key fortifications in Ulster. <br>
<br>O'Reilly led the rebellion in Cavan and, owing to his clever tactics and good organization, soon achieved complete control over the county. On 23 October, O'Reilly's nephew and sheriff of Cavan, Myles Mulmore O'Reilly, visited many of the British protestant settlers in the county and asked for their weapons so that he could arm his forces to fight the rebels. The ruse worked and most of the settlers were peaceably disarmed. The O'Reillys then assembled 3000 men, prompting the English garrison at Belturbet to flee and that at Cavan Town to surrender. Phillip had also divided his enemies by declaring that his rebellion was aimed only against the English, and he made no attempt to take the less important Scottish garrisons at Kelagh and Croaghan. By 29 October Cavan was more or less under rebel control with virtually no bloodshed. At this point many of O'Reilly's men and the Catholic population generally began robbing and assaulting the local protestants. He did his utmost to preserve the protestants' lives and property, but it is apparent that O'Reilly was struggling to maintain his authority over his own troops. Indeed, he even had to rebuke his own wife for inciting the murder of protestants. He arranged for the protestant inhabitants of Belturbet to be convoyed out of the county, but they were robbed and roughly handled by O'Reilly's men as they left. <br>
<br>During November 1641 O'Reilly mustered about 3000 men and, linking up with other rebels from Monaghan and Fermanagh, swept into Meath, capturing a number of towns. After some debate the rebels decided to march on Drogheda instead of Dublin and crossed the Boyne at Trim, intending to complete the encirclement of Drogheda from the south. Hearing of the approach of an English force of 600 foot and 50 horse sent to relieve Drogheda, O'Reilly and his men ambushed them on 29 November at Julianstown, 5 miles south of Drogheda, taking advantage of the morning mist to rout their enemies. This victory had a major bearing on the decision of the Old English Catholics of the pale to join the rebellion. O'Reilly participated in the rebels' unsuccessful siege of Drogheda in the winter of 1641&#150;2 and returned about March 1642 to Cavan, where the two Scottish garrisons continued to hold out. A tight siege was thrown up around the two castles, which surrendered on 15 June. <br>
<br>O'Reilly was based mainly in Cavan for the rest of the war and served as a colonel in the Ulster army of the Catholic confederation under the command of his brother-in-law, Owen Roe O'Neill. He was also appointed to the first supreme council of the Catholic confederation in November 1642 and attended a number of general assemblies in Kilkenny. However, he was usually preoccupied with his military responsibilities. During the political infighting that slowly ripped the confederation apart in 1646&#150;9, O'Reilly remained a staunch supporter of O'Neill. When O'Neill's troops mutinied at Kilbeggan, co. Westmeath, in 1647, O'Neill relied on O'Reilly's regiment to restore order. During the 1648 civil war within the confederation, O'Reilly was the only important Ulster landowner to support O'Neill. Following the destruction of the Ulster forces at the battle of Scarrifhollis in co. Donegal on 21 June 1650, O'Reilly became the main leader of resistance to the parliamentarians, prosecuting an increasingly futile guerrilla war for the next three years. His surrender on 27 April 1653 at Cloughouter in co. Cavan marked the formal end of the wars in Ireland. <br>
<br>Under the terms of his surrender, O'Reilly and 1000 of his men were transported out of Ireland to join the Spanish army, landing in August 1653 in Corunna, where they were garrisoned. This proved an unhappy posting. Relations between the Irish soldiers and the local populace deteriorated rapidly and O'Reilly was furious that Hugh Dubh O'Neill was appointed commander of the Irish forces in Spain instead of him. Eventually, at O'Reilly's insistence, his garrison was transferred to the Spanish Netherlands in August 1654. There his troops mutinied at Armenti&egrave;res in early April 1655, but they were quickly appeased. In 1658 O'Reilly was arrested and imprisoned by the Spanish authorities on suspicion of conspiring to defect with his regiment to the French in order to win the favour of the English and recover his lands in Ireland. His regiment was also disbanded. On 20 March 1660 he received a pension from the Spanish government, although he seems to have had problems in getting it paid. His last years were spent in some poverty as part of a company of Irish infantry in the Spanish Netherlands. He was still alive in October 1664.<br>
