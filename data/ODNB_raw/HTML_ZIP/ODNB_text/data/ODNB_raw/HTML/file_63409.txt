<span class="headword">Nesbitt <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Davis]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1742/3&#150;1825), <span class="occ">courtesan and adventuress</span>, was born Mary Davis, of unknown parentage, but was alleged to have been born &#145;in a wheelbarrow&#146; in Covent Garden  (&#145;History of the T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&#146;); she was also called Polly Davis. She was a strikingly beautiful artist's model, first sitting to Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. Her career as a courtesan may have been directed by the King of Hell, Simon Luttrell, later first earl of Carhampton, who was possibly her seducer  (<span class="italic">Autobiography, Letters and Literary Remains of Mrs Piozzi</span>, ed. A. Hayward, 2, 1861, 23). This connection, allied to Mary's fiery character, may perhaps have earned her the sobriquet Hellfire Davis. Luttrell introduced her to Alexander Nesbitt (<i>bap</i>. 1730, <i>d</i>. 1772), youngest of the three sons of Thomas Nesbitt (<i>d</i>. 1750), who were in partnership as merchants and bankers in the City of London. Luttrell encouraged Mary's marriage to Nesbitt, on 25 February 1768, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and was both a witness to it and a trustee of Mary's marriage settlement, by which Nesbitt settled on her for life his new house and its estate at Upper Norwood in Surrey. The couple also lived in London at 10 Buckingham Street.<br>
<br>According to a &#145;T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&#146; pen portrait of 1775, by 1769 Mary's contemptuous treatment of Nesbitt and her continued connections with the <i>demi-monde</i> had caused his insanity. He certainly suffered a mental collapse and was confined in private lodgings near Blackfriars; he died in 1772. The story of Mary and Nesbitt was told, and Mary's behaviour vilified, by Junius in his letter of 27 November 1771. By 1771 Mary had become the mistress of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13109/', "Hon. Augustus John Hervey (1724&#150;1779)")</script>, naval officer, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13116/', "John Hervey, Lord Hervey of Ickworth (1696&#150;1743)")</script>, and Mary Lepell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13118/', "Hervey, Mary")</script>]; Hervey became third earl of Bristol in 1775, when his alliance with Mary was pilloried in the aforementioned &#145;T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&#146; portrait, and Mary was again castigated for abusing her husband. Mary and Hervey lived together, apparently faithfully, at Norwood House, at 6 St James's Square, and at Ickworth House, Suffolk, but were prevented from marrying when the earl's divorce petition was dismissed, in 1779, because of his collusion in his wife Elizabeth's 1769 action to have their marriage declared void. Referred to by the earl, in his will, as his &#145;dear valuable and best friend&#146;, Mary was both an executor and legatee of the will, the trusts of which were performed only after a dispute with the earl's brother the Hon. William Hervey, Mary's fellow executor, was resolved in her favour in chancery in 1783. She received the manor and advowson of Evedon, other land in Lincolnshire, and &pound;5000 from the sale of about 186 acres in Suffolk. She also received a share of the stock and furniture at 6 St James's Square and at Ickworth, valued at &pound;7378 12<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Mary Nesbitt's financial and professional acumen was thereafter devoted to enlarging the Norwood estate and to establishing herself on the fringes of political life. She exercised influence and patronage in her salon at Norwood, which was frequented by men such as George Rose, secretary to the Treasury, and young aspirants to political office. Her travels and activities in diplomatic circles on the continent during the French Revolution suggest that she may have been employed as a government agent in Pitt's covert attempts to restore the French monarchy. Celebrating her achievements on 25 September 1797, the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> acknowledged that &#145;this celebrated woman&#146;, despite &#145;the miscellany of her life&#146;, had &#145;acquired an elevation &hellip; which she has preserved with dignity&#146;, using &#145;her influence with the great in favour of the unfortunate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Married Life of &hellip; Lady Stanley</span>, 432&#150;3). In the early nineteenth century straitened financial circumstances occasioned the letting of Norwood House and Mary's frequent residence abroad, in 1821 at Montreuil-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais, and in 1822 in Switzerland. She is presumed to have died, aged eighty-two, in Paris, where she was buried on 4 November 1825, and not, as the earl of Bristol had requested in his will, with him at Ickworth.<br>
