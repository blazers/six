<span class="headword">Davidson,  Harold Francis</span>  (1875&#150;1937), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and circus performer</span>, was born on 14 July 1875 at Sholing House in the suburbs of Southampton, the son of the Revd Francis Davidson and his wife, Alice Selina Augusta Hodgkin. From the age of six he attended Banister Court School, Southampton, going on to Whitgift School, Croydon, early in 1890. Despite his father's desire that he should become a clergyman, Davidson wanted to go on the stage, and got his first role in a comedy sketch at the Steinway Hall in London in 1895. He nevertheless decided to seek ordination and gained admission to Exeter College, Oxford, despite a lack of formal qualifications.<br>
<br>Davidson's academic performance continued to be disappointing: forced to leave Exeter College in March 1901, he was nevertheless allowed to persevere with his studies at Grindle's Hall, Oxford, and finally obtained a degree. Contemporaries noted that he had pictures of actresses on the walls of his room, and that he continued to undertake occasional theatrical engagements. His connections were undoubtedly excellent, however, as he served as curate in prestigious parishes; first, Holy Trinity, Windsor, and then from 1905 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. In May 1906 Davidson was appointed to the living of Stiffkey-with-Morston in Norfolk. With an income of perhaps &pound;800 p.a. he was able on 9 October 1906 to marry an Irish actress, Moyra (Molly) Cassandra (<i>b</i>. 1878/9), the daughter of Michael James Joseph Saurin. They had two boys and two girls.<br>
<br>Molly Davidson had a strong temper, and made her feelings known about the &#145;waifs and strays&#146; with whom Davidson increasingly populated the large vicarage. Their fourth child was born while Davidson was serving as a naval chaplain during the First World War: he later admitted knowing that the child was not his. In addition, despite the income of the rectory, it never proved enough to fund all of Davidson's activities; and he unfortunately fell into the clutches of a swindler called Arthur John Gordon, whose dubious financial schemes continued to cast a shadow over the vicar of Stiffkey until his death. In October 1925 Davidson was forced to file for bankruptcy: the settlement with his creditors disposed of much of the income of the rectory for years to come.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Davidson began spending more time in London. With his bishop's permission, he undertook a ministry as a chaplain, accredited to the Actors' Church Union, in and around the theatres of the West End of London. In that twilight world he seems to have been especially drawn to vulnerable women, often as young as fifteen or sixteen years old. He realized that such girls, working as assistants in shops or as &#145;nippies&#146; in Lyons teashops or ABC restaurants, were easily led into casual prostitution. He later recalled having saved such a teenager from drowning herself in the Thames, adding that &#145;I have ever since, whenever I had any spare time in town, kept my eyes open for opportunities to help that type of girl, namely, the country girl stranded on the alluring streets of London&#146;  (Cullen, 32). It became a consuming, if, perhaps, innocent, passion; but his need to seek out and maintain such relationships increasingly dominated his life. Living in rented rooms and battling with suspicious landladies over unpaid rent, Davidson would often return to Stiffkey only at the weekend; but he remained a popular incumbent.<br>
<br>&#145;I was picking up roughly, as my diaries show, an average of 150 or 200 girls a year&#146;, Davidson later recalled  (Cullen, 129). There is no doubt that Davidson actively approached likely girls (many of whom gave him the brush-off, as he did not always wear his clerical collar). He may at times have seemed a pest, but there is little evidence of wrongdoing: he would take them for a cup of tea and get them theatre tickets; would listen to their problems, and through his influential contacts, help them with accommodation and employment. Davidson found places in domestic service for some of those he befriended: others successfully made careers on the stage before marrying. He paid for Rose Ellis&#151;later his chief accuser&#151;to receive medical treatment for syphilis.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1931, for reasons which are still not entirely clear, the bishop of Norwich decided to take action: a firm of private detectives was hired to collect evidence of Davidson's &#145;slackness&#146;. Rose Ellis, who was to be the key prosecution witness, proved willing to testify that for several nights they had slept in the same room, and that he had once tried to have &#145;connection&#146; with her. Presented with the evidence, the bishop of Norwich decided to press charges that Davidson had offended against public morality under the 1892 <span class="roman">Clergy Discipline Act</span> by adultery and accosting young women in London. Supported by his wife and family, Davidson determined to fight the case. It is hard not to believe him when he protested to his bishop that his activities, if not perhaps seemly in the eyes of &#145;the icebergs of chastity&#146;, were still worthy of a man in holy orders  (Cullen, 141). &#145;For years I have been known as the Prostitute's Padre&#146;, he wrote, and it was &#145;the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold&#146;  (ibid., 13).<br>
<br>The consistory court hearing, which opened at Church House, Westminster, on 29 March 1932, was given immense coverage in the press. Newspaper articles were filled with salacious details of Davidson's dealings with young women: the fact that he had keys to their rooms, and often called to see them late at night, being especially heinous in the eyes of the prosecution. Most of the evidence proved to be inconclusive and, but for a startling <i>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>, the prosecution might have failed. However, a shocking photograph was produced of Davidson with a fifteen-year-old girl standing with her back to the camera: although clutching a black shawl, it revealed she was naked.<br>
<br>One newspaper led with the headline &#145;Nude photo bombshell&#146;, and it turned opinion against Davidson. His protestations that he had been &#145;entrapped&#146; by two press photographers were in all likelihood true. Offered money for posing with one of his young fifteen-year-old friends, he may na&iuml;vely have believed that publicity photos would be beneficial after the trial. The verdict of the court on 8 July surprised no one: guilty on all five counts of immoral conduct. Although formally deprived of his holy orders, Davidson continued to protest his innocence, and appealed twice to the privy council. He also tried to state his case at a meeting of the church assembly in 1936: Cosmo Gordon Lang, the archbishop of Canterbury, told him he had no right to speak.<br>
<br>Notoriety unfortunately dogged Davidson until his tragic death. Faced with the need for another source of income, and showing how deep-seated was his theatrical bent, Davidson decided to use his reputation to draw the crowds at fairgrounds and circuses. He was first employed as part of the freak show on Blackpool's golden mile, and was exhibited in a barrel or roasted in a glass oven while a devil prodded him with a pitchfork. &#145;While I am in the barrel I shall be occupied in preparing my case&#146; he told the press  (Parris, <span class="italic">The Times</span>). In 1937, as his popularity was starting to wane, Davidson was forced to sign up with a menagerie at Skegness amusement park. Billed as &#145;A modern Daniel in a lion's den&#146;, he was expected to enter a cage holding two lions, and talk for ten minutes about the lack of justice in his case. Unfortunately, Davidson was badly mauled by one of the lions on 28 July. He was rescued, but died on 30 July 1937, in Skegness. He was buried in the churchyard at Stiffkey.<br>
<br>What exactly motivated the vicar of Stiffkey will never be known. A judicious leading article in the <span class="italic">Church Times</span>, soon after the verdict, criticized the way the trial was handled, but also stressed that Davidson was &#145;foolish and eccentric&#146;  (Cullen, 171). Recent studies suggest he suffered from &#145;multiple personalities&#146;, but do not entirely do justice to the curious mixture of the sacred and profane in his life. A. J. P. Taylor remarked in <span class="italic">English History, 1914&#150;1945</span> (1975) that the case was &#145;the sensation of the decade&#146;, and that he attracted more attention while he lived than Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang. &#145;Which man deserves a greater place in the history books?&#146;, asked Taylor  (p. 316). What is still clear is that the vicar of Stiffkey was indeed foolish and eccentric, both in his life and in the manner of his death.<br>
