<span class="headword">Key,  Thomas Hewitt</span>  (1799&#150;1875), <span class="occ">Latin scholar</span>, was born in Southwark on 20 March 1799. He was the youngest son of the physician Thomas Key, a member of an old Staffordshire family, and his second wife, Mary Lux Barry; the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15495/', "Charles Aston Key (1793&#150;1849)")</script> was his half-brother. Thomas was educated at Buntingford grammar school, Hertfordshire, under the headmaster Samuel Dewe; he recalled that Latin and arithmetic were both well taught. In October 1817 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, and was elected scholar; in the spring of 1819 he migrated to Trinity College, where he also gained a scholarship. After graduating in 1821 (nineteenth wrangler) he hoped to enter the bar, but adhered to his father's wishes by studying medicine in Cambridge and at Guy's Hospital in London (1821&#150;4).<br>
<br>On 26 September 1824 Key married Sarah Troward (<i>d</i>. 1884), daughter of the solicitor for the prosecution in the trial of Warren Hastings. In the same year, in Cambridge, he met Francis W. Gilmer, who had come to England to select founding professors for Jefferson's new University of Virginia. Key accepted the chair of pure mathematics as from 1 April 1825; he resigned in the autumn of 1827, and returned to England. The reason given related to the Virginian climate, but the difficulty of controlling sometimes unruly students may also have been a factor. On 18 July 1828 Key was appointed professor of Roman language, literature, and antiquities in the new London University (in 1836 renamed University College, London). He was recommended by his friend and Cambridge contemporary George Long, who held the chair of Greek, and whose Latin and Greek classes Key had taught at Virginia in 1825 during Long's absence in England. In 1832, jointly with his Cambridge contemporary Henry Malden, the professor of Greek, Key became headmaster of the secondary school which formed part of the university. In 1842 he resigned his chair and became sole headmaster of the school, and retained the post until his death in 1875. His own teaching included both Latin and geography.<br>
<br>The London University School formed an integral part of the university and was housed in its premises. After its foundation in 1830 it had been run by a clerical headmaster: neither he nor his successor lasted long, and the school was near collapse when Key and Malden offered to bear the financial risk themselves. The refounded school of 1832 reflected the ideals of its parent body's founders in being unlike a conventional public school of the period. It had no chapel or religious instruction, neither playing fields nor corporal punishment; all subjects were optional; Latin and Greek verse composition was not taught, but natural science was part of the curriculum. The school (in 1838 renamed University College School) flourished during Key's reign, and grew to accommodate very large numbers: from 249 in 1833 to 623 at Key's death.<br>
<br>On his appointment as sole headmaster Key was given the title of professor of comparative grammar, to which no salary was attached. This title, conferred at his own request, reflected a major interest of Key's. He had worked on Latin etymology while in Virginia, and in 1830 had been one of the founding members of a philological society set up in the London University, to whose meetings he contributed several papers. (The society was refounded in 1842 as the Philological Society of London.) In 1829 he had attended the lectures of his colleague Friedrich Rosen, professor of oriental languages, and from them took the characteristic Sanskrit mode of analysis of words according to their stems (&#145;crude forms&#146;). Rosen's influence can be seen in Key's review of Zumpt's <span class="italic">Latin Grammar</span>  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Education</span>, January 1831); he expounded the &#145;crude-form&#146; system in two articles in the <span class="italic">English Journal of Education</span> (1850&#150;51). Key's <span class="italic">Latin Grammar on the System of Crude Forms</span> was first published in 1846; later editions appeared in 1858 and 1862. The book was, however, little adopted outside Key's own school, despite the advocacy of his pupil and colleague John Robson, later secretary to the College of Preceptors. Later in the 1840s Key began a Latin dictionary organized on the same principle. Planned as a short book, it turned into a much larger project. Progress was slow (by August 1852 the letter C had been reached), and in 1856 Key abandoned crude forms as an organizing principle. In 1865 he engaged the immigrant German classical scholar Wilhelm Wagner to work with him on the project. Wagner negotiated a contract on equal terms, but soon decided that Key wanted an assistant rather than a partner and gave up the task. (Wagner, a man of independent mind and unafraid to speak it, had already ruined his career chances in Germany by public criticism of his teacher and academic patron Friedrich Ritschl.) After Key's death the dictionary, still nowhere near completed, was prepared for publication by his pupil James Reid (<span class="italic">A Latin Dictionary</span>, 1888). This was an act of misjudged devotion: the book was severely handled by reviewers.<br>
<br>Key's Latin grammar reflects his wide reading in the language, and particularly his knowledge of Plautus and Terence, authors little studied in England at that time. As a comparative philologist he was, like many of his contemporaries, enthusiastic but uncontrolled: his was the type exemplified by George Eliot's Mr Casaubon and his search for the &#145;Key to all mythologies&#146;. Key was, for example, willing to argue that &#145;bad&#146; and &#145;better&#146; came from the same root. At the meetings of the Philological Society, of which he was president for several years, he became something of an embarrassment: he gave over sixty papers to the society, many advancing extravagant etymologies. Key contributed articles on language to the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span> (1833&#150;42) of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK). In 1844 the republication of these articles in a single volume led to a controversy with J. W. Donaldson, author of <span class="italic">The New Cratylus</span> (1839) and <span class="italic">Varronianus</span> (1844), who charged him with plagiarism. This developed into a three-cornered battle with George Long, Key's colleague and Donaldson's teacher. The polemical pamphlets which ensued were subsequently collected and published by Key with an introduction (<span class="italic">The Controversy about the Varronianus</span>, 1845).<br>
<br>A number of campaigns claimed Key's attention and support. He was among the founders of the London Library, and became a member of its committee. He was also active in the recruitment campaigns of the late 1850s amid the perceived threat of an invasion from France. For the SDUK, on whose committee he served, he wrote not only on language but also on ancient geography, and provided maps for its atlas. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1860.<br>
<br>Key died of bronchitis at his home, 21 Westbourne Terrace, Paddington, London, on 29 November 1875, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was survived by his widow and six of their seven children. Key's career had included chairs in three different subjects as well as his headmastership. To some of his pupils he remained an exemplary figure: tall, impressive, and genial&#151;the Red Queen to the White Queen of his shy colleague Henry Malden. His pupil John Hicks recalled that &#145;his presence [was] commanding, his voice sonorous&#146;  (Hicks, 14). Less than exemplary, however, was his reluctance to acknowledge his intellectual debts to Friedrich Rosen, and to give credit to his collaborator Wilhelm Wagner. A marble bust by Thomas Woolner was presented to University College by Key's pupils and friends, but has since disappeared.<br>
