<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pett,  Phineas</span>  (1570&#150;1647), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and naval administrator</span>, was born at Deptford on 1 November 1570, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22057/', "Peter Pett (d. 1589)")</script>, master shipwright, of Deptford and his second wife, Elizabeth Thornton (<i>d</i>. 1597). He attended school at Rochester and Greenwich before entering Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1586. It would appear that he was intended for a career in the law or the church but his father's death and his mother's subsequent marriage to &#145;a most wicked husband&#146; forestalled his future plans  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 2). He was, however, awarded the degrees of BA in 1592 and MA in 1595.<br>
<br>Lack of prospects and funds obliged Pett, with his mother's encouragement, to become apprenticed to Richard Chapman, a master shipwright at Deptford, thereby following in an established family tradition. Once again Pett's plans were aborted with the death of Chapman after only three years of service, during which time he claimed to have learned little. Desperation obliged him to join the privateer <i>Gallion Constance</i> as a humble carpenter's mate, but its Mediterranean cruise proved unproductive and in 1594 Pett once again found himself facing destitution in London and dependent on his brothers Peter and Joseph.<br>
<br>The preparation of the <i>Defiance</i> and the <i>Triumph</i> for what was to be Drake's last voyage provided Pett with employment as a common workman. He also embarked on a deliberate campaign to advance his career by establishing contact &#145;with men of good rank far better than myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, lv). This practice was to serve Pett admirably throughout his career. He was employed in the same humble capacity during the construction of the <i>Repulse</i> for the earl of Essex's Cadiz expedition while at the same time studying mathematics and ship construction in the evenings under the tutelage of the master shipwright Matthew Baker. It was during this period that Pett came under the notice of the earl of Nottingham, the lord high admiral, who became his patron. From this point his star began to ascend, first as purveyor of timber in Norfolk and Suffolk in 1599&#150;1600, and then as keeper of the stores at Chatham in June 1600. He used the role of purveyor to some financial gain and the navy treasurer, Sir Fulke Greville, questioned his accounts and withheld &pound;20 from him. In March 1601 he became assistant to the master shipwright at Chatham. He quarrelled with and discarded Baker, having found more prestigious patrons. This breach reveals one of the less attractive sides of Pett who throughout his life believed that those who disagreed with him were conspiring maliciously against him.<br>
<br>In accordance with contemporary practice Pett was on the look-out for patrons and associated himself with Sir Robert Mansell, Greville's successor as navy treasurer, and Sir John Trevor, the navy surveyor. Unfortunately, in a period when naval administration was at its most corrupt, Mansell was arguably its most corrupt officer, with Trevor his willing accomplice. It was therefore highly likely that Pett would be drawn into dubious practices, as proved to be the case. As early as 1602 it was alleged (in an anonymous account preserved by Pepys) that Pett had sold the fore-topmast of the <i>Repulse</i>, for which offence Sir Henry Palmer sen., comptroller of the navy, struck him with a cudgel. Pepys also provides a list of items allegedly stolen by Pett, including timber sufficient to build a bridge and a sluice, and to run a small business selling posts (painted with naval paint) on which to hang clothes.<br>
<br>None the less Pett's position was secure and in 1604 he was ordered to build a miniature ship for Prince Henry, whose pleasure in it further assured Pett's future. In the following year he was granted the reversion of the positions held by Baker and his brother Joseph, and the latter's death in the same year allowed Pett's succession to the post of master shipwright at Deptford. In 1604 he had embarked on a shady construction project, in partnership with Mansell and Trevor. This was the construction of the <i>Resistance</i>, a small vessel of about 160 tons laid down in a private yard at Gillingham belonging to David Duck, a fellow shipwright at Chatham. The vessel was built entirely from timber, rigging, and sails which had been &#145;borrowed&#146;, or purchased at discounted rates, from the dockyard at Chatham on warrants from the principal officers, two of whom were Mansell and Trevor. She was then hired to the state as a transport for Nottingham's embassy of 1605 to Spain and rated as 300 tons (almost double her actual size). Not content with the excessive freight payment the owners also loaded a cargo for trade in Spain and Pett, in command, also sold a demi-culverin plus shot to the Spanish for &pound;300, together with some of the ship's victuals (also &#145;borrowed&#146; from Chatham). Pett's brother even managed to sell some of the vessel's sails during the voyage.<br>
<br>The extent of corruption in naval affairs finally forced James I to act and in 1608 a commission of inquiry was established under Nottingham and Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, to investigate the matter. It quickly emerged that Pett was one of the main offenders, his name appearing a number of times, notably in the <i>Resistance</i> affair. Other offences in which he was implicated were the acceptance of poor timber and the continuous repair for personal gain of vessels that were no longer serviceable. An example of this was the <i>Anne Royal</i> the estimate for which was &pound;3576 but which in fact under Pett's supervision cost &pound;7600. He also allegedly received bribes for the delivery of short loads of stores and used naval timber to build an extension to his house. Pett's response to these accusations was less than convincing but equally he seems to have been taking an undue proportion of the blame, much of which should have fallen on his superiors, Mansell and Trevor. Fortunately for Pett the king decided in 1609 to judge the matter personally. A condemnation of Pett would have damned the principal officers and even Nottingham, so ignoring the evidence James let all parties off with only a lecture. As a result the navy was condemned to an indefinite future of malpractice.<br>
<br>In 1607 Pett built a scale model of a substantial ship which so impressed the lord admiral that he in turn presented it to the king. James agreed to the construction of a ship based on the lines of the model. This is perhaps the first instance of a scale model being presented for approval before construction began, the vessel being the <i>Prince Royal</i>. The laying of the keel in October 1608 coincided with the commission of inquiry and thereby raised doubts as to the suitability of Pett as a builder, both morally and professionally. Baker stated &#145;that he never saw any work of his doing whereby he should so think him sufficient for that work, but rather thinketh the contrary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, lxviii). Baker also estimated the cost of constructing such a large ship (1187 tons old measurement) at &pound;7000. The actual cost came to almost &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>The <i>Prince Royal</i> was in fact only the third vessel fully built by Pett (he had rebuilt three and contributed to others) and undoubtedly there was a considerable amount of envy in the opposition of his fellow shipwrights, accentuated by Pett's rapid rise. An investigation of her construction, instigated by Northampton but under the direction of Nottingham, together with the earls of Worcester and Suffolk (both of whom were ignorant of ship design), decided in Pett's favour, as did the king. By contrast a survey by six shipwrights together with Captain George Waymouth provided a detailed list of her defects. It is important to note that many of the misdemeanours of which Pett was accused were common practice among his colleagues and his patrons ensured that he survived the commission of inquiry and the launch of the <i>Prince Royal</i>. One charge, of having used insufficient and unsuitable timber, does appear to have had substance for by December 1621 the navy commissioners were complaining that the vessel was unfit for service having been built of decayed or green timber. Almost &pound;1000 was spent in repairs although they felt more was required (&pound;6000). In 1641 the ship was completely rebuilt by Peter Pett at a total cost of over &pound;18,000.<br>
<br>A further commission of inquiry was instituted in 1618 and yielded much the same results as that of 1608&#150;9, although this time Pett did not emerge as the chief villain. One outcome of the inquiry was the recommendation to concentrate shipbuilding at Deptford, whereas Pett was employed at Chatham. William Burrell, the East India Company's chief shipwright, was contracted to build two ships a year for five years at Deptford, much to Pett's anger. He maintained a characteristic enmity towards Burrell despite the fact that Burrell had supported him in the <i>Prince Royal</i> affair.<br>
<br>Pett's career continued to prosper despite the damage to his reputation. In 1612 he was appointed first master of the Shipwrights' Company and in the following year was present when the elector palatine was escorted to Flanders. He was present on the 1620&#150;21 expedition against the Algiers pirates and in 1623 sailed to Santander to collect the infanta. Marks of royal favour continued when Charles I succeeded to the throne, the new king awarding him a gold chain and allowing him to be present when Henrietta Maria embarked at Boulogne in June 1625. In February 1630 he became an assistant to the principal officers and in late December that same year a full principal officer.<br>
<br>In 1620 Pett built two vessels for a consortium of London merchants but, as was common practice, he exceeded his instructions by more than doubling their dimensions in order to increase profits. The merchants refused to pay the extra costs, which consequently had to be borne by Pett (a total of &pound;900). To meet his debts (he was arrested briefly in 1628) he borrowed &pound;325 from his brother Peter, who died about 1631. After his death Peter's widow relentlessly pursued the debt until eventually Pett was arrested in December 1634 despite going into hiding. He appears eventually to have cleared the debt. A similar instance of exceeding instructions may have occurred when Pett built the <i>Destiny</i>, on which he lost &pound;700, for Sir Walter Ralegh in 1617. In 1633 Pett was again accused of graft, along with Sir Henry Palmer jun., over the sale of old cordage (&#145;brown paper stuff&#146;). In February 1634 he and a number of others were suspended from office only for Pett to receive a personal pardon from Charles. Throughout his career he relied on patronage from the highest levels at times of crisis.<br>
<br>In 1634 Pett prepared a model for what was to be the largest ship in the navy, the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> (1522 tons). Despite opposition from the masters of Trinity House, much of it transparently wrong, the keel was laid in December 1635 and the ship launched in October 1637, six months late. Once again the budget proved inadequate. Despite Pett's original estimate of &pound;13,860, and assurance to complete her for &pound;16,000, the final cost was a staggering &pound;40,833. Pett continued to work at Chatham, where, following the defection of the fleet to the earl of Warwick in July 1642, he handed the dockyard over to parliament's control. For this he was rewarded with appointment as a navy commissioner on the same allowances as he already held, higher than the &pound;100 allowed the other commissioners. He was not an active commissioner, perhaps owing to his age, and lived out his remaining years quietly at Chatham.<br>
<br>Pett was married three times: on 15 May 1598 to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1627), daughter of Richard Nicholls of Highwood Hill, Middlesex; in July 1627 to Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eaglefield (<i>d</i>. 1636), widow of Robert Yardley; and in 1638 to Mildred Byland, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Etherington (<i>d</i>. 1638). He had three daughters and eight sons with his first wife. His eldest son, John (who married Katharine Yardley, daughter of Robert Yardley, in 1625), was lost in his ship the <i>Sixth Whelp</i> when returning from the Rochelle expedition in 1628; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22058/', "Peter Pett (b. 1610, d. in or before 1672)")</script> was a shipwright and navy commissioner; Phineas (1619&#150;1666) was killed in the <i>Tiger</i>; and Christopher (1620&#150;1668) was a master shipwright at Woolwich and Deptford. Their father died at Chatham, where he was buried on 21 August 1647.<br>
