<span class="headword">Hasluck <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hardie]</span>,  Margaret Masson</span>  (1885&#150;1948), <span class="occ">ethnographer</span>, was born on 18 June 1885 at Chapelton, Drumblade, near Elgin, Scotland, the eldest of the nine children of John Hardie, a farmer, and his wife, Margaret Leslie. Brought up jointly by her grandparents, she was educated at Elgin Academy before taking first-class degrees in classics from Aberdeen and Cambridge universities. In 1910 she became the first woman nominated for a studentship at the British School at Athens. In the following summer she joined a dig in Anatolia under William Ramsay.<br>
<br>In Athens, Margaret met the distinguished archaeologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56624/', "Frederick William Hasluck (1878&#150;1920)")</script>, and they married at her home in Scotland on 26 September 1912. For the rest of her life she blamed herself for her husband's early death, convinced that the tuberculosis that slowly killed him had been contracted on a trip to Konia in 1913. The trip had been his wedding present to her; the destination had been her choice. After his death she spent many months assembling and editing his notes for posthumous publication.<br>
<br>Gradually Hasluck returned to her own work and interests. In 1921, having received a travelling fellowship from Aberdeen University, she began ethnographic fieldwork in Macedonia and Albania. From 1923 she lived in Albania, where her husband had studied the Bektashi. She became &#145;the first west European scholar, female or male, to do systematic, sustained, ethnographic work&#146; in large parts of the country  (Clark, 128). She travelled all over Albania, in all weathers and by all modes of transport, spending whole seasons in the mountains. Her extensive notes and data covered a wide variety of topics: from local dialects, coinage, and customs, to witches, blood feuds, and botany. She sent dozens of artefacts to the Marischal Museum in Aberdeen. Indeed, in methodology and commitment, Hasluck far surpassed her contemporary Edith Durham (1863&#150;1944). Unlike Hasluck, Durham never learnt Albanian, for example, and she spent only a fraction of Hasluck's sixteen years in the country.<br>
<br>In 1935 Hasluck settled in the town of Elbasan, where in the following year she built a house. Elbasan was also the home of Lef Nosi, a distinguished Albanian patriot and a cabinet minister in Albania's first government. He shared her interests in archaeology and ethnography and the pair became very close, though the claim by Albanian communist writers that Hasluck was Nosi's mistress is impossible to substantiate. Whatever the relationship, it too ended in tragedy. In April 1939, on the eve of the Italian invasion of Albania and for reasons still unclear, King Zog demanded that Hasluck leave the country. She never returned to Albania or saw Nosi again. A member of a puppet government set up by the Germans in 1943, he was shot by Albania's communist regime in 1946.<br>
<br>In February 1942, while living in Cairo, Hasluck was recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and charged with exploring possibilities of encouraging resistance in occupied Albania. During the First World War both she and her husband had spent time working for British intelligence, as had many members of the British School at Athens. At that time her own work had been of little account, but she now assumed a significant role. From Istanbul she established lines into Albania and sought to recruit exiled Albanians for operations. By 1943 she was back in Cairo as head of SOE's Albanian section, briefing SOE operatives before they parachuted into Albania, teaching them the rudiments of the language, and providing and collating intelligence. Within SOE she became known affectionately as Fanny Hasluck, a reference to the many younger FANYs, women of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, who worked for SOE in administrative roles. For her tireless efforts she was appointed MBE in 1944.<br>
<br>To Hasluck's great dismay, however, SOE came to support Albania's communist-led partisans, the most committed and dynamic of the country's guerrilla bands. And as the partisans became stronger, threatening to tear apart the pre-war Albania she had known of relative peace and established order, she resigned, although it is likely her deteriorating health also played a part. Early in 1944 she was diagnosed with advanced leukaemia and given little time to live. SOE considered it possible that overwork had exacerbated her condition.<br>
<br>Margaret Hasluck was a tall, handsome woman whose height and bearing had, on occasion, caused her to be mistaken in Albania for a man. To the end, her life interspersed moments of distinction and achievement with others of terrible tragedy and loss, but any depression she may have nursed was disguised beneath enormous reserves of energy, enthusiasm, and kindness. Yet she could be obstinate and impatient, traits that could alienate her even from friends. And though she loved and was rigorous in fieldwork, self-doubt made her slow to publish. Had she published more and for a wider audience, she might have become as well known as Edith Durham.<br>
<br>After spells spent for health reasons in Switzerland and Cyprus, Hasluck moved to Dublin, where she died of leukaemia on 18 October 1948. She was buried beside her parents in the churchyard at Dallas, Scotland. Her most significant work, <span class="italic">The Unwritten Law in Albania</span> (1954), a comprehensive study of the Albanian custom of blood feud, was published after her death.<br>
