<span class="headword">Tooke,  John  Horne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>John Horne]</span>  (1736&#150;1812), <span class="occ">radical and philologist</span>, was born on 25 June 1736 in Newport Street, Westminster, the third of the seven children and the youngest son of John Horne, a prosperous poulterer, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Horne. He was baptized John Horne at St Anne's, Soho, on the following day.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundeducationandearlycareer"></a>Background, education, and early career</h2>Horne was born into a respectable middle-class family. His mother was a benevolent figure, persuading her husband to donate money to the Middlesex Hospital, of which he later became one of the first treasurers. Horne's father was a man of singularly independent character, exemplified by a lawsuit with Frederick, prince of Wales, who lived next door to the Horne family in Leicester House. When some of the prince's officials sought a passage to Newport market by making an opening through a wall belonging to the Horne property without seeking permission, Horne's father brought the case to court and won. Having achieved his purpose, John Horne senior allowed the doorway to be reopened and was accordingly appointed by the prince as the official supplier of poultry to his household. Despite the immediate honour of this appointment, the prince's sudden death in 1751 saw a debt of several thousand pounds unrecovered.<br>
<br>Horne as a child was decidedly unique, possessing a maturity beyond his age. An old lady who knew him in his youth recollected how he &#145;never was a boy: with him there was no interval between childhood and age; he became a man all at once upon us&#146;  (Stephens, 1.22). He had no particular interest in games or sport, finding instead the most exciting moment of his childhood to be a military expedition on which he joined his father, who was a commissioned officer of the trained bands. As to education, Horne was well grounded yet never really showed signs of distinction. At the age of seven he was sent to Soho Square Academy, and a year later found himself attending school in Westminster. In 1746 Horne entered Eton College, where he spent the next six years. He was elected to the distinction of king's scholar and lived in the college. While his origins distinguished him from so many of the boys at Eton whose families were of the upper classes, Horne apparently felt for the most part at ease among his peers. As a scholar he was bright&#151;more so than brilliant&#151;and as an adult admitted to employing some of the other boys to do his homework. While he neglected the set curriculum, Horne prescribed his own readings, and it is no surprise therefore to find him later advocating that it &#145;is best to let children read what they like best, till they have formed a taste for reading; and not to direct what books they shall read&#146;  (Rogers, 165). In his youth, Horne's imagination was captured by the writings of Shakespeare and Milton, although reading would have become something of a chore following an accident during his schooldays in which he lost the sight of his right eye during a struggle with a fellow student. He was subsequently sent to school in Kent for a time, but disliked the institution intensely and ran away from his tutor, justifying his actions to his father on the grounds that his mentor was ignorant of grammar.<br>
<br>In 1753 Horne was sent to private tutors at Sevenoaks and, the following year, at Ravenstone in Northamptonshire in preparation for admission to Cambridge University. On 12 January 1754 he was admitted as a sizar to St John's College and was senior optime in the tripos of 1758, graduating that year with a BA honours degree in mathematics. During his undergraduate years Horne became well acquainted with Richard Beadon, tutor to the future duke of Gloucester, who later became master of Jesus College, bishop of Gloucester, and finally bishop of Bath and Wells. Despite their divergent careers after university, Horne and Beadon remained close friends. Like Beadon, Horne was reared for the clergy, that being the wish of his father, who was a devout member of the Church of England. But Horne had ambitions for a legal career, and as early as 9 November 1756, while an undergraduate, he enrolled as a member of the Inner Temple, during which time his parents refused to support him.<br>
<br>After graduating from Cambridge, Horne worked briefly as an usher in a school at Blackheath. As a young man at this stage he had a fairly regular physical appearance, with an athletic build, a high forehead, and brown hair. He enjoyed the company of women, but during his time at Blackheath was involved in a love affair with a young woman living in the same house. The relationship was aborted and Horne later recalled how he &#145;luckily escaped from two evils&#151;matrimony and misery at the same time&#146;  (Stephens, 1.28). During this time his father continued to insist on his religious calling, and Horne finally conceded, being ordained deacon on 23 September 1759 and becoming a curate in Kent. He was not, however, fully committed to his post and resigned within a few months following a sudden attack of ague. On his recovery, Horne began to frequent his inn of court on a daily basis, determined &#145;to eat his way to the bar&#146;  (ibid., 1.30). He was befriended at this time by John Dunning, who would later act as his defence counsel, as well as Lloyd Kenyon, who ironically later presided at a trial of Horne and became chief justice of the king's bench and master of the rolls.<br>
<br>Pecuniary circumstances forced Horne to abandon his legal interests, and on 23 November 1760 he was ordained a priest. His father purchased him a living at New Brentford said to be worth between &pound;200 and &pound;300 a year and he was offered further inducements to remain in the church. Although as a preacher Horne was said to be proficient, his sermons were orthodox discourses, as exemplified by the one published in 1769 and entitled simply <span class="italic">A Sermon</span>. His religious creed is indeed elusive, perhaps on account (as he later admitted) of having no real interest in theological issues. He was, however, a fervent opponent of Roman Catholicism and had no desire to advocate the cause of dissenters. Apart from these convictions, Horne's creed was, according to John Wilkes, believed &#145;to be <i>non credo</i>&#146;  (Wilkes, <span class="italic">Controversial Letters</span>, 29). Nevertheless, Horne conducted his duties with characteristic professionalism and care. With only a half-hearted interest in spiritual matters at best, he studied medicine in the hope of improving the physical well-being of his parishioners and opened a dispensary for their benefit. Despite these efforts and his sobriety at this time, some of his flock found cause to criticize him for what they saw as inappropriate enthusiasm for whatever entertainment the neighbourhood offered and, more particularly, for his fondness for playing cards.<br>
<br>Horne was never completely settled in his duties as curate and in February 1763, not long after the end of the Seven Years' War with France, he eagerly accepted the position of travelling companion to France of the son of the eccentric John Elwes, MP for Berkshire. The sojourn lasted for around twelve months, nine of which Horne spent learning the French language. While there he was introduced to Jean le Rond d'Alembert, the mathematician and <i>philosophe</i>, and by chance became acquainted with the Scottish philosopher David Hume. On his return to England, Horne was promised an appointment as king's chaplain, principally through the influence of Elwes and his brother-in-law, the natural philosopher Stephen Demainbray, but his interests were captured by prevailing politics.<h2>
<a name="HorneandtheWilkesitecause"></a>Horne and the Wilkesite cause</h2>When Horne returned from France in 1764 he was imbued with patriotism, a detestation of Lord Bute, a delight in the popular apotheosis of William Pitt at the time, and a sense of outrage at the treatment of Wilkes over the infamous <span class="italic">North Briton</span> affair. In the following year he published an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Petition of an Englishman</span>, which comprised twenty-three pages of bold and vindictive satire against Bute and Lord Mansfield and offered a defence of Wilkes. It was a deliberately provocative piece, openly inviting prosecution, and as such was not welcomed by most printers. While the work was offensively critical in its rhetoric, Horne remained unprosecuted&#151;perhaps, as Alexander Stephens contended, owing to the government's desire not to publicize Horne's insinuations about Bute's insidious relationship with the dowager princess of Wales, which the author supported by including a map of Kew Gardens showing the path by which Bute could discreetly attend upon the princess.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1765 Horne once more ventured overseas, this time in the company of the son of a Mr Taylor, a gentleman from near Brentford. Having abandoned his clerical dress, Horne began &#145;flaunting through the continent in very unclerical suits of flowered silk and gold lace&#146;  (Bleackley, 176). At Calais he met Thomas Sheridan and his wife, and at Paris met Wilkes for the first time through an introduction he carried from Humphrey Cotes, a Westminster wine merchant. Both men soon struck a close relationship, which Wilkes conveyed to Cotes in a letter dated 7 October 1765: &#145;I have had the pleasure several times of seeing Mr Horne, and I thank you heartily for so valuable an acquaintance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Wilkes</span>, 2.207). Before Horne left Paris the two men agreed to remain in contact with each other.<br>
<br>From Paris, Horne travelled to Ferney to meet Voltaire, but the influential French writer did not inspire Horne, who later declared him to be &#145;inferior in everything&#146;  (Stephens, 2.435). He then visited Lyons for a week, where he was frequently in the company of Laurence Sterne, with whom Horne acquired a friendship despite the former being &#145;clearly bored&#146; by the latter's constant praise of Wilkes  (Cross, 375). In Italy, Horne probably got to know the Italian language and became fascinated with Machiavelli. He visited all the principal cities but spent most of his time in Genoa, where he fraternized with a distinguished local family. During this time he became fascinated by a Genoese beauty, Signora Durazzo, but not all of her family approved of his affections. On leaving the city Horne was fortunate to escape death when some of the signora's family mistakenly shot another Englishman.<br>
<br>Back in France, Horne and his companion went to Montpellier, where they became known to Adam Smith, who was then tutor to the duke of Buccleuch. Horne, however, was not well disposed towards Smith, remarking later that he was inferior to Hume and that some of his writings were &#145;nonsense&#146; and &#145;written with wicked views&#146;  (Rogers, 160). It was from this resort city that Horne also decided to write to Wilkes, on 3 January 1766, in a language not befitting his clerical standing: &#145;It is true I have suffered the infectious hand of a bishop to be waved over me; whose imposition, like the sop given to Judas, is only a signal for the devil to enter&#146;  (Stephens, 1.76). Wilkes never replied, and when Horne reached Paris in 1767 he questioned Wilkes as to his reticence. Wilkes at first tried dismissing Horne's enquiries as a joke, then denied ever receiving the letter, even though it was known to Horne that he had seemed determined to publish it on several occasions. Despite this incident the two men remained on friendly terms, and it was to Wilkes that Horne entrusted five of his fashionable suits upon his departure for England on 25 May 1767, presumably on the assumption he would be soon returning.<br>
<br>During summer 1767 Horne made an effort to apply himself to his clerical duties at Brentford, preaching popular charity sermons and often accepting invitations to speak at London churches. Yet his real enthusiasm was for the world of politics, and it was the return of Wilkes in spring 1768 in time for the general election which rekindled his political passions. When Wilkes decided to stand for Middlesex, Horne was in a position to promote the Wilkesite cause. He organized the use of the two best inns at Brentford by Wilkes's supporters and threw himself earnestly into the political fray, covering the whole constituency on foot or horseback. Under the rousing banner of &#145;Wilkes and Liberty&#146;, Horne used his powerful oratory to sway the electors and his virulent wit to attack the sitting members, George Cooke and Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, in the press. In the end Wilkes won the election, but was soon after arrested on outstanding charges and imprisoned.<br>
<br>As the government continued to refuse Wilkes the right to take his seat in parliament, Horne became an outspoken activist in the ensuing agitations. He made concerted efforts to have a magistrate, Gillam, prosecuted for ordering soldiers to shoot innocent bystanders on 10 May 1768 during the riots in St George's Fields. In the autumn he helped Wilkes draw up a petition to parliament, and during the next Middlesex election campaign, following the death of Cooke, Horne published a series of sarcastic letters in the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> attacking Proctor and upholding the Wilkesite candidate. The death of another innocent bystander, George Clarke, in an election riot in December 1768, again saw Horne rally for justice by calling for the prosecution of Edward M'Quirk. A pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Appeal to the Public Touching the Death of Mr George Clarke</span> (1769) was published under the name of the surgeon who examined Clarke, John Foot, but was apparently written by Horne.<br>
<br>In 1769 Horne was elected burgess of Brentford and on 20 February of that year, under Horne's auspices, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script> was formed at the London tavern. An advertisement for the society drawn up by Horne states that &#145;their <i>sole aim</i> is to maintain and defend the <i>legal</i>, <i>constitutional liberty</i>&#146; of the people  (Wilkes, <span class="italic">Controversial Letters</span>, 150&#150;51), but its primary objective was to assist a financially crippled Wilkes through subscriptions. Supported by some of London's wealthiest and most prominent agitators, the society managed to raise considerable amounts towards retrieving Wilkes's finances. Horne was at this time occupied with an exhausting interest in political contests, such that one critic later commented that he was acting &#145;as a kind of travelling counsel to every man who thought himself capable of being made an object of public commiseration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 969). Horne, however, had a genuine interest in public liberty and justice. On several occasions he disclosed violations of justice in the courts, including the case of two Spitalfields weavers hanged for murder, which Horne published as <span class="italic">Genuine Copies of All the Letters &hellip; Relative to the Execution of Doyle and Valine</span> (1770). He was even more frequently concerned with political grievances, for instance attacking George Onslow, a former friend of Wilkes and MP for Surrey, in a letter published in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> on 11 July 1769 in which he accused Onslow of accepting a bribe in the process of making an appointment to a position in America. On 24 August, Onslow initiated a civil suit against Horne which was tried at Kingston before William Blackstone on 6 April 1770, but the case was deemed nonsuited on legal technicalities. A new trial was brought before Lord Mansfield on 1 August 1770 with the added charges of Horne using defamatory words at a meeting of Surrey freeholders. The jury acquitted Horne over the letters, but ordered he pay &pound;400 in damages for his words. Horne appealed against the judgment, and the case was finally set aside in the court of common pleas on 17 April 1771.<br>
<br>Despite the distractions of these legal engagements, Horne remained active in the political scene. On 30 March 1770 he made a speech to Middlesex freeholders, published as an <span class="italic">Oration Delivered by the Rev. Mr Horne</span> (1770), in which, <i>inter alia</i>, he humorously foreshadowed his legal battle with Onslow. He was also co-author of an address presented to George III by the City of London on 14 March 1770 and the author of another remonstrance presented on 23 May 1770. There is some unlikely speculation that Horne wrote the reply often attributed to William Beckford to the king's answer to the last petition. By the end of 1770 a rift between Horne and Wilkes had opened. It seems that hostilities between the two began after a meeting of Westminster electors on 31 October when Horne published in the newspapers a slighting account of Wilkes's performance. An exchange of written retorts continued until the end of 1770. At much the same time there were suggestions among some Bill of Rights Society members that Wilkes was abusing the society's financial generosity, which came to a head on 12 February 1771 when Horne carried a motion that &pound;500 be raised to help William Bingley, a printer imprisoned in 1768 for publishing the <span class="italic">North Briton</span>. Two weeks after Horne's motion was passed, another resolution was made that no new subscriptions would be entered into until Wilkes's debts were discharged. On 9 April 1771 Horne moved that the Bill of Rights Society should be disbanded, and when his proposal was rejected by a vote of twenty-six to twenty-four, the minority withdrew and soon formed the Constitutional Society.<br>
<br>In May 1771 Horne published two articles in the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> on electoral reform advocating annual parliaments, but stopping short of calling for universal suffrage. It was at this time, as Wilkes announced his candidacy for the office of sheriff of London, that Horne reopened their dispute. For two months the men again exchanged offensive letters, in which Horne was variously accused of misappropriating Bill of Rights Society funds and his letter to Wilkes from Montpellier in 1766 was brought to public attention. Horne reacted by accusing Wilkes of pawning his suits left in his possession in 1767 and revealing details of his personal extravagances and financial dishonesty. The combatants were, as Horace Walpole observed, engaged in &#145;a civil war between themselves&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 31.151). In the ensuing election of sheriffs Horne supported Richard Oliver, who was defeated. Horne's effigy was burned before the Mansion House, indicative of the damage his moral and political reputation had suffered in the course of his dispute with Wilkes.<br>
<br>Soon after this controversy had subsided Horne applied for his MA at Cambridge, and despite opposition from the likes of William Paley, Lord Sandwich, and other religious colleagues the degree was conferred. It was not long before Horne was again embroiled in a heated debate, this time with the scathing critic who published under the pseudonym Junius. Horne was accused of working secretly for the government in the recent election of City sheriffs and was advised to &#145;go back to his cloisters&#146;  (Junius, 253). Horne was quick to react to Junius's claims, and in the written exchanges that followed it was Horne who emerged the victor, having &#145;sunk Junius at last by law arguments&#146;, as William Godwin remarked  (Bewley and Bewley, 48).<br>
<br>Amid the political controversies and legal entanglements, Horne remained a popular social figure. His political clique met at the house of Richard Liver, and he kept rooms in Frith Street near his friends Michael Moser, keeper of the Royal Academy, and Thomas Sheridan. Horne was also a keen backgammon and whist player, and as such became known to Domenico Angelo and his son, Henry, doyen of fencing masters, as well as the musicians Johann Christian Bach and Karl Abel. Despite his affability, Horne's personal life remained somewhat unsettled. By the early 1770s he had fathered a son, Sidney Montague, the eldest of his three children, who later served in the East India Company. He was also the father of two daughters, Mary and Charlotte, both of whom used their mother's surname of Hart, but he never married. He seems to have held a rather facetious attitude towards the virtues of matrimony and monogamy, once asserting that he would never marry a pretty woman since &#145;she would be studious to be admired by others and to please anybody more than her husband&#146;  (Rogers, 154&#150;5). Horne had a certain courtly charm with women and he perhaps revelled in a bachelor's lifestyle. It has also been suggested that Horne's avoidance of marriage may be due to his sensitivity over a lifelong bowel problem. Whatever the reason, Horne was definitely shy of marriage, a fact captured by an amusing anecdote which recounts how he had proposed marriage to a Miss Arabin in a letter, but suddenly realized what he had done and returned to the post office to destroy the note.<br>
<br>While his personal life was unsettled, Horne's professional career remained equally uncertain. In 1773 he resigned from his clerical post and moved to a house in Windmill Lane in New Brentford, where he studied philology and again determined to study law. His friends offered him an annuity of &pound;400 until he was called to the bar, but Horne never took advantage of their offer. Not long after settling into his new residence, Horne was called to the aid of his friend William Tooke, whose property at Purley, near Croydon, was to be affected by an enclosure bill which his neighbour, Thomas de Grey, was petitioning to present to parliament. Realizing that it was too late to counter-petition, Horne published a letter in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> attacking the speaker, Fletcher Norton, with accusations of partiality in this case and implying that he had been bribed. After the printer of the newspaper gave up the author's name, Horne was ordered to the bar in February 1774. After much deliberation Horne was discharged, de Grey's bill removed, and a measure passed to prevent such bills being so readily presented in future. While Charles James Fox strongly opposed Horne throughout this contest, earning him the lasting wrath of Horne, Tooke was eternally grateful for his assistance and showered him with gifts and promises of inheritance.<h2>
<a name="Themiddleyears17751788"></a>The middle years, 1775&#150;1788</h2>As the Wilkesite cause slowly faded, Horne's attentions were soon focused on the American War of Independence. Although he generally regarded Americans to be &#145;of a very inferior cast&#146;  (Stephens, 2.337), Horne was sympathetic to their constitutional demands, realizing that when &#145;the people of America are enslaved [Britons] &hellip; cannot be free&#146;  (Horne, <span class="italic">Oration</span>, 36). Following a clash between the colonists and British troops at Lexington and Concord in April 1775, the Constitutional Society, at Horne's suggestion, raised a subscription for the Americans concerned. Horne was to convey the money to Benjamin Franklin, and the society's resolutions were drawn up by Horne and published in the newspapers to announce that the subscription was for &#145;our beloved American fellow-subjects, who &hellip; preferring death to slavery, were &hellip; inhumanly murdered by the King's troops&#146;  (Bewley and Bewley, 60). Horne's efforts in this transaction were recognized on 17 June 1919, when the New England Society of Brooklyn unveiled in St Mary's Church, Ealing, a memorial tablet in his honour and paid for a refurbishment of his grave. Far from being honoured at the time, Horne found himself charged with libel for the advertisement he prepared, and on 4 July 1777 was tried before Lord Mansfield. He defended himself with characteristic forcefulness and audacity but was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison, to pay a fine of &pound;200, and to find sureties for three years of &pound;400 from himself and &pound;200 from two others. In 1778 he brought a writ of error in parliament to reverse the verdict, which was argued by John Dunning, but the judgment was affirmed on 11 May 1778.<br>
<br>Horne was confined in the king's bench prison, where he contracted gaol fever and started drinking claret as a cure, although he later attributed the gout from which he suffered for the rest of his life to the alcohol he consumed in prison. He was permitted to pay for decent accommodation outside the prison walls but &#145;within the rules&#146;, and was frequently visited by friends and dined on a weekly basis at the Dog and Duck public house in St George's Fields. During his imprisonment Horne wrote <span class="italic">A Letter to Mr Dunning on the English Particle</span> (1778), in which he devotes much attention to the etymologies of words and grammatical standards concerning prepositions and conjunctions. The letter was originally conceived as a means of arguing that his conviction was wrong on account of some grammatical infelicities in the indictment. In time the <span class="italic">Letter</span> formed an integral part of Horne's major work, <span class="italic">Diversions of Purley</span>.<br>
<br>After serving eight months of his sentence, Horne was released and rented a room in Vine Street, London, where he continued his legal studies. With promises of many briefs from eminent lawyers, he applied in Trinity term 1779 for admission to the bar, but was rejected by a majority of eight to three benchers of the Inner Temple on the grounds that he was a clergyman. He reapplied in 1782, when Lord Shelburne supported his application, but it was again rejected. In 1794 Horne was once more among the candidates, but no bencher moved for his call. The constant rejections and the inability to fulfil his vocational desires apparently left Horne disgruntled for the remainder of his life, going so far as to sour his relationship with Lord Shelburne, whom Horne held responsible for his rejection. Soon after his unsuccessful application in 1779 Horne moved to a small estate at Witton, near Huntingdon, where he applied himself to farming and spent some of his father's legacy improving the property. Ill health, however, forced him to sell the estate back to the previous owner, and while Horne's movements shortly thereafter remain obscure it is known that at various times during the next nine years he worked as an accountant in Huntingdon for Sir Robert Bernard, lived at 12 Paper Buildings, Temple, and rented a house in Dean Street, London, with his two daughters. Horne also spent time during this period residing with William Tooke at Serjeants' Inn and Purley, and in 1782 added the name of Tooke to his own, which was supposedly an indication that Horne was to be Tooke's heir.<br>
<br>While Horne Tooke's time, especially in the early 1780s, was divided between London and the country, he remained active in City politics. In 1780 he collaborated with Richard Price to expose the financial corruption associated with the British war effort in America, which was written up as <span class="italic">Facts addressed to landholders, stockholders &hellip; and all the subjects of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1780) and was published in eight editions. He was also a prominent member of the extra-parliamentary reform groups that formed around London, including the committees known as the Quintuple Alliance, and he was nominated for membership of the Society for Constitutional Information on 6 July 1781 by its founder, John Cartwright. Horne Tooke was a supporter of William Pitt's calls for parliamentary reform and in May 1782, as head of some Westminster delegates, called on Pitt to congratulate him on his reform stance. That same month he was present at the Thatched House tavern with Pitt, the duke of Richmond, the earl of Surrey, and other leading reformers of the day when it was decided to petition parliament in support of Pitt's reform proposals. Around this time Horne Tooke published <span class="italic">A Letter to Lord Ashburton</span> (1782), a work that was published in several editions and republished in 1793, in which he expressed the idea that the aim of good government is the greatest happiness of the individual, a tenet which later became central in Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism. Although an active reform campaigner at this time, Horne Tooke's political interests were somewhat narrow. He was not inclined to oppose the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> despite having numerous dissenting friends, nor did he take much interest in the Irish cause or the anti-slave trade movement.<br>
<br>The time Horne Tooke spent residing in London gave him the chance of becoming a member of the Speculative Society, a literary and philosophical debating club, where he came to know Richard Sharp and James Mackintosh. He also fraternized during the 1780s with Edward Topham, founder of <span class="italic">The World</span> newspaper (to which Horne Tooke contributed), as well as James Perry, the Scottish journalist, and Joseph Johnson, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Analytical Review</span>. It was, however, the friendship between William Tooke and Horne Tooke which was commemorated in the latter's most significant writing, <span class="italic">Epea Pteroenta, or, The Diversions of Purley</span>, the first part of which was published in 1786 and revised in 1798, with part two published in 1805. A third volume was planned, but Horne Tooke burnt all his personal papers shortly before his death. Aimed at well-educated readers, <span class="italic">Diversions</span> was an attempt to democratize language, and as a philological treatise was influential on contemporaries such as the radical grammarians William Cobbett and William Hazlitt and was read by many including Henrietta, countess of Bessborough, who described the second part of the work as a &#145;strange book&#146;, which she thought &#145;imprudent, ingenious, indecent and entertaining&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.136&#150;8). Horne Tooke profited from the publication, having received subscription payments of 2 guineas that he never returned for the unpublished third volume and making a sum of &pound;4000&#150;&pound;5000 from royalties and subscriptions on the first two volumes.<br>
<br>Although Horne Tooke was never a prolific writer he soon followed <span class="italic">Diversions</span> with another work, entitled <span class="italic">A Letter to a Friend on the Reported Marriage of HRH Prince of Wales</span> (1787). This eight-page pamphlet was published in London and Dublin and focused on the assumed scandalous marriage of the prince and Maria Fitzherbert. The following year Horne Tooke produced another work, <span class="italic">Two Pair of Portraits</span> (1788), in which he derided Charles James Fox and praised Pitt in a satire that was as scurrilous as it was persuasive. At this time Horne Tooke belonged to the Revolution Society and was also involved in the Constitutional Club formed to support Admiral Samuel Hood during the Westminster election of 1788. He had also assumed greater control of a waning Society for Constitutional Information, helping to revive the group with younger members such as the radical Count Alvise Zenobio, Thomas Walker, and Thomas Cooper.<h2>
<a name="Theradicalyears17891794"></a>The radical years, 1789&#150;1794</h2>Following the outbreak of revolution in France, Horne Tooke was present at a meeting of the Society for Constitutional Information on 27 November 1789, when a message of congratulations was agreed to be sent to the French national assembly. The following year he opposed Fox in the election for Westminster, and although a popular candidate his campaign suffered from a lack of official backing. He polled last of the three candidates, receiving 1679 votes, but he claimed a moral victory, attracting nearly half as many votes as Fox or Hood but outlaying only &pound;28 on advertising. John Thelwall served as Horne Tooke's assistant during the election and came to admire him as the first person of &#145;capacious and highly-cultivated mind&#146; with whom he had associated  (Thelwall, 76). Horne Tooke was also unrelenting, and petitioned parliament on 12 December 1790 on the grounds that the Westminster electors were disenfranchised, but by a vote of the house the petition was laid on the table. By an act of 1789 Horne Tooke was liable for the costs incurred, and Fox accordingly brought an action against him for the taxed cost of his expenses. The case was heard before Lord Kenyon on 30 April 1792, and despite Horne Tooke's able harangue on corrupt electoral practices a verdict was found in favour of Fox. The trial proceedings were published as a pamphlet and reissued in 1812 and 1819.<br>
<br>As the Society for Constitutional Information rose to prominence in the burgeoning reform movement of 1791, so too did Horne Tooke. He was instrumental in organizing the distribution of Thomas Paine's first part of <span class="italic">The Rights of Man</span> through the society, and in 1792 he became a member of the Friends to the Liberty of the Press and helped draft the constitution of the London Corresponding Society at the request of its founder, Thomas Hardy. In June 1792 he moved to Wimbledon, where he had earlier purchased a house, later called Chester Lodge, on the west side of Wimbledon Common, and where his neighbours included Henry Dundas and William Wilberforce. His residence became the rendezvous for weekly Sunday dinners, the conversations at which catered for the broad spectrum of political views held by Horne Tooke's guests. Despite the convivial nature of these soir&eacute;es, the government viewed such gatherings with increasing suspicion, and Horne Tooke himself came under close scrutiny. When he met Charles-Maurice Talleyrand during his diplomatic missions in 1791 and 1792, the authorities declared Horne Tooke's mail to be opened as a suspect person along with Paine and Talleyrand. Horne Tooke's activities during 1792&#150;4 did not give the government any reason to offer mitigation. During 1792 Horne Tooke helped found reform clubs in Aldgate and Southwark calling themselves after the Friends of the People, and with expanding numbers of the Society for Constitutional Information Horne Tooke moved the group's meetings to the Crown and Anchor, where he also organized a dining club every Friday evening before meetings of the society. His failing health and move to Wimbledon did not dampen his enthusiasm, as he continued to attend all the society's meetings and co-authored with John Martin, a lawyer, <span class="italic">An Address to the People of Britain</span> (1794), approved on 20 January by the London Corresponding Society. An increasingly nervous government had spies working within Horne Tooke's circle by this time, and the suspicion of him as a subversive is reflected in the many caricatures in which he is portrayed as a revolutionary sansculotte.<br>
<br>By 1794 Horne Tooke had emerged, according to one scholar, as &#145;the heart of the reform movement&#146;  (Brown, 52), and as such it is little surprise that the authorities kept a close eye on his movements. Soon after the apprehension of Hardy on 12 May 1794, a letter to Horne Tooke from Jeremiah Joyce was intercepted which posed the question: &#145;Is it possible to get ready by Thursday?&#146; The reference, as Horne Tooke subsequently proved, was to the preparation of a pamphlet listing sinecure places, but the government apparently interpreted the phrase as referring to an insurrection, and Horne Tooke was duly arrested on 16 May 1794.<br>
<br>On 19 May 1794 Horne Tooke was sent to the Tower along with other radical suspects including Thelwall and Hardy. A personal diary kept by Horne Tooke in his interleaved copy of <span class="italic">Diversions</span> records the daily inconveniences and hardships of a regimented prison life, his concerns for the welfare of his daughters, and the physical agony which accompanied the constant and painful treatment of testicular and intestinal problems. Despite the adversities, the veteran reformer was both defiant and heroic. In July he recorded that his confinement had given him<blockquote>time to review my life that is passed; and I cannot find any one Action that I have committed, any word that I have written, any syllable that I have uttered, or any single thought that I have entertained, of a political nature, which I wish either to conceal or to recall. (Tooke, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 57)</blockquote>Such a spirit made Horne Tooke a role model for his imprisoned colleagues, with Thelwall encouraged by his &#145;philosophic firmness&#146; and &#145;playful vivacity&#146;  (Thelwall, 193), and Stewart Kyd dedicating the second volume of his <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Corporations</span>, written within the Tower, to Horne Tooke's friendship and scholarship.<br>
<br>Horne Tooke and the other prisoners remained in the Tower for five months before being transferred to Newgate on 24 October 1794 to await their trials on charges of high treason. Like most radicals Horne Tooke was prone to self-dramatization, declaring to Thomas Holcroft &#145;that the best thing our prosecution could have done, for the cause of freedom, was that which they had done: imprison and indict us; except the still better thing which they had yet to do: namely hang us&#146;  (Holcroft, 87). Hardy was the first tried, but was acquitted on 5 November 1794. Twelve days later the government proceeded against Horne Tooke, who was ably defended by Thomas Erskine and Vicary Gibbs. The trial lasted six days before Sir James Eyre, with Horne Tooke conducting himself in a &#145;very cool, clever and witty&#146; manner  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 1.105) and playing a part in examining witnesses. He was &#145;like some amateur actor pleased with his part and resolved to make the most of it &hellip; he rarely laughed himself, but glanced around from his keen and arch eyes a satirical look of triumph&#146;  (Townsend, 2.24). On 22 November the jury retired for just two minutes before returning a verdict of not guilty. Horne Tooke's acquittal was the cause of celebration, with newspapers printing trial accounts and his portrait for free. The London Corresponding Society issued commemorative medals, and anniversary dinners became a regular event among reformers, ensuring that the treason trials of 1794 and the hardships endured by the accused remained etched in radical memory.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Following his release Horne Tooke withdrew to Wimbledon, his conduct now more cautious as a result of his failing health, dwindling finances, and the sobering effects of prosecution. According to his own calculations, he had spent a total of 519 days in prison since 1774, which would have had a significant financial and emotional impact. It was not until the general election of 1796 that he showed some renewed passion for politics, when he stood for Westminster against Fox and Sir Alan Gardner. He campaigned against war, taxation, economic depression, and repressive legislation, and held himself out to the electorate as a political martyr who had progressed &#145;from the hustings to Newgate and from Newgate back to the hustings&#146;  (Bewley and Bewley, 192). Horne Tooke polled last of the three candidates, and was fortunate that the &pound;1000 which his campaign cost was offset by a donation from a patron. Around this time Sir Francis Burdett was introduced to the Wimbledon circle, and it was not long before Burdett emerged with &#145;some degree of intellectuality&#146; from the political initiation offered by Horne Tooke  (<span class="italic">Works of Jeremy Bentham</span>, 10.404), whom he admirably referred to as the &#145;Wizard of Wimbledon&#146;  (Bewley and Bewley, 256). More revolutionary elements were also in the habit of visiting Horne Tooke. The new London Corresponding Society leaders, John Gale Jones, Francis Place, and John Binns, were acquainted with the veteran reformer, and several United Irishmen became regular guests at Wimbledon. The weekly dinners at Horne Tooke's house were a haven for plebeian radicals, as well as popular writers such as Anna Barbauld and John Wolcot and liberal-minded literati including William Godwin, Jeremy Bentham, Joel Barlow, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.<br>
<br>Despite the popularity of the Wimbledon gatherings their meeting did not raise the same conspiratorial suspicions as those earlier in the decade, perhaps owing to the waning political enthusiasms of the host. Horne Tooke filled his time with gardening, reading, and enjoying the companionship of his daughters and tom cat. He nevertheless maintained an interest in prison reform, campaigning in particular for changes in Cold Bath Fields prison, and took an interest in the case of Gilbert Wakefield, who was imprisoned for libel. Horne Tooke himself was involved in a libel case in 1799, this time prosecuting John Wright, a bookseller, who printed a record of the secret committee of the House of Commons which in the run-up to the treason trials of 1794 had concluded Horne Tooke to be a subversive. Horne Tooke argued that this was a libel since it accused him of a crime of which he had been acquitted, but Lord Kenyon judged that a report of the Commons could not be a libel.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1790s Horne Tooke was living on slender means, having endured the financial strains of infrequent employment, legal engagements, and imprisonment. He had resigned himself to giving up his Wimbledon home and renting a small cottage, but in 1799 he was the timely recipient of a legacy from Felix Vaughan, and his friends raised a subscription and bought an annuity of &pound;600 from Sir Francis Burdett. Horne Tooke soon after involved himself in organizing a fund to support Marcus Despard and his conspirators, who were arrested in 1801 for planning the assassination of George III. James Moody, Horne Tooke's secretary at the Westminster election of 1796 and government spy, reported that Horne Tooke's house served as the &#145;Headquarters&#146; for organizing the Despard subscription and that Horne Tooke was &#145;the High Priest&#146;  (Hone, 114). At much the same time he met Lord Camelford, who encouraged him to accept his pocket borough of Old Sarum. Although the two men held opposing political views, they remained friends until Camelford was killed in a duel in 1804. For Horne Tooke the offer to sit in parliament came too late to change his life, but it was still an attraction, and he appreciated the irony and challenge of a political reformer representing a rotten borough. On 16 February 1801 Horne Tooke sat in parliament for the first time. By this time, however, he had lost much of his vigour. Age and ill health made him appear in parliament as &#145;pale and sickly&#146;, although he maintained an &#145;expression of sagacity and energetic resolution&#146;  (Bewley and Bewley, 212).<br>
<br>Horne Tooke's position in parliament was soon challenged by Lord Temple on the grounds that he held holy orders, and a select committee was appointed to investigate precedents. The committee's report on 4 May 1801 was not favourable, and Addington introduced a bill to exclude clergymen from election to parliament. Horne Tooke proposed an amendment, but the bill was passed on 19 May despite its opposition by Fox, Sheridan, and Erskine, as well as by Thurlow in the Lords. While the process of determining Horne Tooke's eligibility drew on, he took part in proceedings and made his maiden speech before parliament on 18 February 1801. While his speeches lacked the persuasive effect one might anticipate, Horne Tooke managed to impress some with his oratories, including William Cobbett, who thought they contained &#145;more good sense on political economy than I ever heard of being uttered in that House for the last 30 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cobbett's Weekly Political Register</span>, 193). Horne Tooke kept his seat until parliament was dissolved in June 1802, and in an address to the Westminster electors he declared that &#145;nothing short of another miracle could possibly enable me to render you any service&#146; in parliament  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 29 June 1802).<br>
<br>At the election of 1802 Horne Tooke maintained his interest in City politics, appearing in the Westminster hustings in support of Fox for a time and then John Graham. At Brentford he rallied in support of Burdett. Later that year William Tooke died, but instead of making Horne Tooke his heir he decided to discharge some personal debts and bequeathed his old friend the sum of &pound;500. William Tooke's nephew, William Harwood, and great-nephew, John Beaseley, were to share the greater part of the fortune, although Horne Tooke claimed a verbal agreement was in place to divide the legacy equally between the three men. By this time, Horne Tooke had acquired an advance from Burdett to cover annuities for his daughters, and when Harwood refused Horne Tooke's claim Burdett sued and Harwood counterclaimed in chancery. After ten years the case was finally concluded in favour of Burdett.<br>
<br>Despite the freedom afforded by Horne Tooke's financial security and semi-retirement from public life, he still laboured under the effects of gout. Indeed the desperate search for a cure perhaps accounts for his eccentric belief that jolting removed impurities from the human body. Thus he was in the habit of hiring a carriage and riding the roughest roads for several hours when he felt it necessary for his health. His infirmities, however, proved so debilitating that at the Westminster election of 1806 he was unable to campaign for James Paull in spite of his desire to help. The following year, after Paull and Burdett duelled, Horne Tooke published his last pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Warning to the Electors of Westminster</span> (1807), in which he denounced Paull. Horne Tooke was by this time restricted from playing an active role in politics&#151;more so by his body than his mind. Rheumatism and other problems had made him a virtual prisoner in his own home, and in January 1808 he was so ill it appeared he would die. Horne Tooke, however, slowly recovered only to relapse in August 1809. Within weeks the Old Price riots at Covent Garden theatre were in the public spotlight, and Horne Tooke was a passive supporter of the rioters' cause. As he continued to struggle for his life in the next three years, he maintained an insatiable appetite, especially for grapes, and lost none of his mental alertness.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Despite his will to live, Horne Tooke knew his time was quickly passing. He prepared a tomb in his garden and had a tombstone inscribed. In his last eighteen months he treated himself to a refurnished parlour and refurbished parts of his house, but was characteristically benevolent in discharging the taxes of struggling cottagers behind his property. Horne Tooke's last days were spent in suffering, as he endured kidney stones and gangrene in the legs. Under the constant care of his daughters and Burdett, Horne Tooke refused any visit by the clergy and passed his last days correcting a copy of Shakespeare. He died on 18 March 1812 in Wimbledon and, despite his wish to be buried in his garden, his daughters and sister insisted on a traditional Christian funeral, which took place on 30 March 1812 at St Mary's Church in Ealing. His will bequeathed his estate and possessions to his eldest daughter, Mary Hart.<br>
<br>After his death Horne Tooke was as much revered and reviled as he was during his life. A writer in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> thought his life was &#145;an unavailing and ungraceful struggle&#146;  (p. 315), while the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> found no reason to distinguish Horne Tooke &#145;among the principal actors in the political theatre during the last half century, yet he has certainly [made] &hellip; his influence strongly felt&#146;  (p. 462). Lord Brougham, in referring to Horne Tooke's political career, thought that &#145;no man out of office all his life and out of Parliament all but a few months &hellip; ever acted so conspicuous a part in the political warfare of his times&#146;  (Bewley and Bewley, 275). Horne Tooke was indeed a central figure in the burgeoning reform movement of the eighteenth century and his name appears in the chronicles of many of the seminal events of British political history during this period. He is perhaps best remembered by historians for his intrepid roles in the Wilkesite cause, in support of the American revolutionaries, and in the treason trials of 1794. While his political career remains well recognized, Horne Tooke's contributions as a philologist are less significant. Despite the contemporary success and influence of his main treatise on the subject, <span class="italic">Diversions</span> was outdated by the mid-nineteenth century. Arguably his greatest claim in this respect, as Leigh Hunt suggested, is the fact that he was &#145;perhaps the first philologist of his nation&#146;  (ibid., 275). What cannot be denied is that Horne Tooke, irrespective of the success of his labours in pursuit of his political ideals or philological ideas, was a man whose character ensured he would be influential. His open and hospitable personality attracted to him many friends and disciples, who enjoyed his conversations that could fluctuate freely between humorous wit and caustic criticism. While his physical presence was never particularly imposing and his body fragile and lame in the end, it was his intelligence and mannerisms which ensured him respect in all forums. He was &#145;a man of independent spirit and upright character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 424), and it is that unchanging feature under all circumstances which remains so memorable about Horne Tooke.<br>
