<span class="headword">Geneville <span class="st"> [Joinville]</span>,  Geoffrey  de</span>, first Lord Geneville  (1225<span class="mult">x</span>33&#150;1314), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, came from Champagne, and styled himself lord of Vaucouleurs. He was a younger son of Simon de Joinville (<i>d</i>. 1233) and his wife B&eacute;atrice (<i>fl</i>. 1226&times;1233), daughter of &Eacute;tienne, count of Burgundy and Auxonne; his eldest brother was Jean de Joinville, biographer of Louis IX of France (<i>r</i>. 1226&#150;70). Geoffrey came to England in 1251. His half-sister was the wife of Peter of Savoy, earl of Richmond (<i>d</i>. 1268), one of the queen's uncles, and he was linked to a powerful group of Savoyards at court. He was closely associated with the heir to the throne, the future Edward I, and was with him in Gascony in 1255. Through marriage between 1249 and 1252 to Matilda de Briouze, widow of Pierre de Genevre, and a granddaughter and coheir of Walter de Lacy, Lord Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1241), he acquired lands in the Welsh marches, at Ewyas Lacy and Ludlow, and in Ireland, where he and his wife held half the county of Meath. His power there was centred on the great castle at Trim, which he held at the king's pleasure.<br>
<br>Edward, the heir to the throne, used the Geneville castle at Ludlow in the days after his escape from custody in 1265. Geneville also provided important assistance in Ireland in that year. He showed great political skill in reconciling Montfortian and royalist supporters, enabling Edward to receive significant support from Ireland in the campaign that culminated in victory at Evesham.<br>
<br>There was a strong crusading tradition in the Geneville family, extending back to the mid-twelfth century: Geoffrey and his brother William duly accompanied Edward on crusade in 1270, but returned before him [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94804', "Lord Edward's crusade")</script>]. Geoffrey was then appointed justiciar of Ireland in 1273, a post he held until 1276. He was given wide powers, and every effort was made to keep him supplied with money. But his years in office can hardly be regarded as successful, and he was heavily defeated by the Irish in 1274 and 1276. He served in Edward's Welsh wars, but his interests increasingly centred upon Ireland: in 1283 he granted his English lands to his son Peter. Later in Edward I's reign Geneville and his wife had a series of disputes with the Dublin government. They had been successful in the 1250s in recovering the original franchisal rights, as they had existed under Henry II, in their liberty of Trim. In 1293, however, the liberty of Trim was taken into the king's hands, following a dispute over a case of imprisonment. The liberty was restored two years later in recognition of Geneville's service in Wales. It was confiscated again in 1302, but eventually, after a long struggle, he succeeded in maintaining his palatine rights. Geneville was fortunate in having the support of the king in his arguments with royal officials in Ireland.<br>
<br>Geoffrey de Geneville was an experienced diplomat: he took part in negotiations with the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1282) in 1267, and in 1280 he acted as Edward's proctor in Paris. In 1290 and 1300 he went on missions to the papal curia, and in 1298 and 1299 took part in Anglo-French peace negotiations. His major role in domestic politics came in 1297, when he supported the king in the crisis caused by royal demands for men and money for the French war. Edward summoned troops to London, and demanded that Roger (IV) Bigod, earl of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1306), and Humphrey (VI) de Bohun, earl of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1298), enrol them, in their capacities as marshal and constable. This the earls refused to do, so the king replaced them in their offices with Geneville and Thomas de Berkeley respectively. Geoffrey's appointment was appropriate, as he had been assistant to the marshal in the Welsh war of 1282. Once the crisis was over, the office reverted to the earl of Norfolk. Between February 1299 and November 1306 Geneville received a number of personal summonses to parliaments.<br>
<br>Geoffrey de Geneville outlived his wife, who died on 11 April 1304, and their two sons, Geoffrey and Peter, and died on 21 October 1314, far from his native Champagne and advanced in years, at the Dominican priory of Trim, to which he had retired in 1308, and where he was to be buried. His heir, his granddaughter Joan, married Roger Mortimer, earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1330), lover of Queen Isabella.<br>
