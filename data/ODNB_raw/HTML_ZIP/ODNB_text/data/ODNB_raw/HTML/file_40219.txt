<span class="headword">Arnold,  Sydney</span>, Baron Arnold  (1878&#150;1945), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Hazel Bank, Hazel Road, Altrincham, on 13 January 1878, the son of William Ashness Arnold, stockbroker, and his wife, Sarah Anne, daughter of Charles Linney. Baptized at Bowden Downs Congregational Church, he was educated at Manchester grammar school and trained as a chartered accountant before joining his father's firm, W. A. Arnold &amp; Sons, in 1900; he was a member of the Manchester stock exchange from 1904 to 1922. While working as a broker he devoted his leisure time to liberal politics and held office in the Manchester Liberal Federation, the Manchester Reform Club, and the Free Trade Union. He first stood for parliament at Holderness, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, in the general election of December 1910 and was narrowly beaten. In June 1912, at a by-election, he was successful at Holmfirth (later Penistone) in the West Riding, and represented the constituency as a Liberal until 1921, when he resigned his seat owing to ill health.<br>
<br>Arnold established himself in the House of Commons as an expert on national finance, and in 1914, after serving as parliamentary private secretary to the president of the Board of Education, he became parliamentary private secretary to the financial secretary at the Treasury. During the war he was involved in several government missions to France, but although he was commended for this work he grew increasingly out of step with his party. He opposed conscription, favoured a negotiated peace, and in April 1918 urged a levy on capital to clear the national debt. The &#145;capital levy&#146; did not then have the overtones of class war that it later assumed, and Arnold advocated the scheme on purely fiscal grounds. But it is indicative of his outlook that he placed the burden of the tax exclusively upon the wealthy, among whom he was to be numbered, and his politics now tended increasingly to the left.<br>
<br>In 1922 Arnold broke with the Liberals and joined the Labour Party, where his political experience proved a valuable asset. He had a significant influence on policy, although not in his advocacy of the capital levy, which Labour leaders came to see as an electoral liability. In the Labour government of 1924 he served as parliamentary under-secretary of state for the colonies. Since for health reasons Arnold could not stand for parliamentary election, his appointment entailed the creation of a Labour peerage, then a novel step. He was created Baron Arnold on 12 February 1924. The scarcity of Labour peers meant that he had a heavy workload in the House of Lords, where he spoke often on financial matters. As befitted his political origins he remained vigorous in defence of free trade.<br>
<br>By 1929 Arnold had been taken into the inner circle of Labour politics, and he accompanied Ramsay MacDonald on the nationwide speaking tour which laid the basis for Labour success at the general election in May. Later in the year he was with MacDonald on his historic visit to the United States, the first by a British premier. Though Arnold described himself as only the &#145;organ-blower&#146; on this mission, he was recognized as a valued member of the prime minister's team and a close confidant of MacDonald himself. In the second Labour government he was appointed paymaster-general and he also sat on the Ullswater committee into electoral reform. In March 1931, though, he resigned his office to concentrate his energies on advocating free trade and temperance. Failing health was the ostensible reason for this decision, but in reality Arnold felt neglected by MacDonald, with whom his influence had inexplicably declined. After the formation of the National Government in August, Arnold sought a socialist riposte from Labour and was included in the finance and trade committee that oversaw the radicalization of party policy. But during the 1930s he became alienated over Labour foreign policy, which he thought made war more likely; in March 1938, after Attlee attacked the Anglo-Italian agreement negotiated by Chamberlain and Mussolini, he resigned his party membership.<br>
<br>Arnold continued, though, to sit in the Lords and to comment freely on the political scene from which he had, at least in party terms, detached himself. He was a dissenting voice after the outbreak of war in 1939, and in mid-December urged the government to pursue a Dutch&#150;Belgian offer of mediation with Hitler. Arnold believed that Hitler was &#145;genuinely anxious for peace and was prepared to go a long way to get it&#146;, and that more favourable terms might then be gained than could ever be won later  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 242). In the same debate he condemned what he saw as the wrecking tactics of Churchill, whose uncompromising views on peace Arnold believed encountered &#145;astonishment and repugnance&#146; among great numbers in the country  (ibid., 241). These remarks led the Labour MP Ernest Thurtle, in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (15 Dec 1939), to question Arnold's position in the Lords, given his renunciation of the party that had placed him there. But Arnold was unrepentant, observing that &#145;it is not I who have changed. At the time when I was made a peer the Labour Party was generally regarded as a peace party. Can that fairly be said of it in the last few years?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Dec 1939).<br>
<br>Arnold's opposition to the war was motivated by the fear that there would be a repetition of the &#145;fight to the finish&#146; mentality of 1914&#150;18, but also by a belief that in focusing its energies on Nazism the British government was in danger of losing sight of the &#145;black shadow of Communism, which may spread right over the whole of Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 246). In February 1941 he attacked the anti-German, as opposed to anti-Nazi, content of government propaganda broadcasts. His last major contribution to Lords debate was, fittingly enough, on the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> in June 1942, when he showed a characteristic concern for the interests of wage earners. Arnold died, unmarried, at Stoneycrest Nursing Home, Hindhead, Surrey, on 3 August 1945.<br>
