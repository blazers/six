<span class="headword">Pavy,  Salomon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1602), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was baptized on 12 May 1588 at St Dunstan's, Stepney, Middlesex, the son of John Pavy. Nothing is known of his parents, nor of Pavy's early career, except that he was allegedly abducted into service as a child actor. In 1601 the managers of the Children of the Queen's Revels, Nathaniel Giles, Henry Evans, and James Robinson, were accused in a Star Chamber case of abducting Thomas, son of Henry Clifton, in this way; among those named in the court documents as previously having suffered such an abduction was &#145;Salmon Pavey, apprentice to one Peerce&#146;  (Bentley, 276). Nathaniel Giles did indeed have powers to recruit children, forcibly if necessary, deriving from his role as master of the choir at St George's Chapel, Windsor. The Clifton case, at least, appears to have been a misapplication of those powers.<br>
<br>&#145;Peerce&#146; can be identified as Edward Pearce, master of the second children's company, the Children of Paul's. According to Reavely Gair, Pavy may have played &#145;Salomon A Schoole Boy&#146; in William Percy's <span class="italic">The Faery Pastoral</span>, a text probably written for this company and datable to about this period. Pavy seems then to have changed company to return to the Children of the Queen's Revels at the Blackfriars Theatre, since he is included in the cast lists for two plays, <span class="italic">Cynthia's Revels</span> (performed 1600&#150;01) and <span class="italic">Poetaster</span> (performed 1601), as printed in Ben Jonson's 1616 folio. Pavy is second in these lists, behind Nathan Field, suggesting that his roles were prominent, a conjecture given extra weight by the fact that in the quarto text of <span class="italic">Cynthia's Revels</span> &#145;Sal&#146; is named as one of the three boy actors who perform the Induction. This contracted form of his name gave rise to the erroneous supposition by William Gifford (1756&#150;1826) that Pavy's Christian name was Salathiel, a mistake which is still widely repeated.<br>
<br>Salomon Pavy died of unknown causes at the age of thirteen, and was buried on 25 July 1602, at the church of St Mary Somerset, a five-minute walk from the Blackfriars Theatre. Ben Jonson commemorated Pavy in a graceful epitaph which includes the lines:<blockquote>
<div>Yet three filled <i>Zodiackes</i> had he beene<br>
</div>
<div>The stages iewell;<br>
</div>
<div>And did act (what now we mone)<br>
</div>
<div>Old men so duely,<br>
</div>
<div>As, sooth, the <i>Parcae</i> thought him one,<br>
</div>
<div>He plai'd so truely.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Epigrams</span>, 120.11&#150;16)</blockquote>Of all the actors Jonson ever worked with, he honoured only Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, and Pavy with epitaphs, and in this one he praises not just Pavy's youth and innocence but also, strikingly, his technical skill as an actor. Although Jonson is usually taken to mean &#145;old&#146; in the sense of &#145;extremely aged&#146;, the word could merely be a synonym for &#145;mature&#146;: but either way, this statement that Pavy's acting was convincing is one of the very few pieces of evidence about the verisimilitude of children's company performance.<br>
<br>In the Induction to <span class="italic">Cynthia's Revels</span>, Second Child addresses one of the other two children as &#145;Sal&#146;. William Gifford argued that Second Child was addressing Third Child, thus identifying Pavy as Third Child, and indicating that Pavy played the relatively minor role of Anaides in the play itself. But a rival argument is that the quarto identifies Pavy as First Child, in which case he was charged with speaking the Induction of the play. In addition, he could have played the role of Jonson's avatar Criticus in the play proper, and perhaps therefore even the role of Horace in <span class="italic">Poetaster</span>. This might help to explain Jonson's special honouring of him in an epitaph.<br>
<br>Jonson's poem has ensured that Pavy is not forgotten. In 1912 the composer William Denis Browne set the text to music under the title &#145;Epitaph on Salathiel Pavy&#146;; a ballad opera entitled <span class="italic">The Ballad of Salomon Pavey</span> was written in 1976 by Jeremy James Taylor and David Drew-Smythe, and has enjoyed considerable success since. Whereas Nathan Field and other colleagues of Pavy's are remembered for their later careers, Pavy has, in a sense, become an emblematic representative of that lost figure, the Elizabethan boy actor.<br>
