<span class="headword">Dillon,  Francis <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1823&#150;1909), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in London on 24 February 1823, the younger son of John Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1868), of Morrison, Dillon &amp; Co., a successful firm of silk mercers, of Fore Street, London, and the owner of a fine collection of watercolour drawings, including several by J. M. W. Turner; only the forename of his mother, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1856), is known. Following Mary's death, John Dillon remarried and with his second wife had three more children. Francis was educated at Bruce Castle School, Tottenham. In 1846 he joined the Royal Academy Schools, and subsequently became a pupil of James Holland. On 27 March 1847 he married Emma Josephine Case (1822&#150;1860), and in the following year he took her and their daughter to Madeira for several months, also visiting Lisbon. This trip, the first of many, resulted in Dillon's first exhibits in oil, <span class="italic">On the Tagus, Lisbon</span> (ex P. Polak, 1966) at the Royal Academy, and <span class="italic">Ribeiro Brava, Madeira</span> at the British Institution, both in 1850, and also in the publication of <span class="italic">Sketches in the Island of Madeira</span> (1850), a volume of thirteen lithographs.<br>
<br>Dillon continued to exhibit frequently at the Royal Academy until 1903 and at the British Institution until its close in 1867. He was a founder member of the Dudley Gallery in 1865, and exhibited there until, in 1882, it was assimilated into the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, of which he then became a member, exhibiting there until 1908. He exhibited elsewhere in London, including the Society of British Artists, the Grosvenor Gallery, and the New Gallery, and also in Manchester and Paris. Much of the subject matter for his paintings was drawn from the scenery and buildings he encountered during his extensive travels abroad. He visited several parts of Europe, including France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and Norway, and, in 1881&#150;2, he travelled to Portugal, Spain, and Morocco; but two countries further afield, Egypt and Japan, made the greatest impact on his career.<br>
<br>Dillon visited Egypt on at least four occasions. In 1854&#150;5 he ascended the Nile as far as Aswan, making many fine watercolour sketches (examples ex Christies, 9 June 1970, 9 November 1971). He returned in 1861&#150;2 when he shared a studio in Cairo with George Price Boyce and the Swedish artist Egron Lundgren. They lived in an oriental manner and were befriended by Iskender Bey, son of S&uuml;leyman Pasha, formerly a French officer. Several drawings from this trip were published in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (April 1862). Subsequent visits were in 1869&#150;70, 1873&#150;4, and possibly later in the 1870s. Several of Dillon's exhibited paintings reflect his interest in the antiquities of Egypt, including <span class="italic">The Colossal Pair, Thebes</span> (exh. British Institution, 1857; ex Christies, 30 November 1984) and <span class="italic">The Pyramids from the Island of Roda</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1863; ex Maas Gallery, 1983&#150;4). These were highly acclaimed at the time, the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> judging <span class="italic">The Colossal Pair</span> &#145;among the most admirable of modern works&#146;  (1857, 69), but, while the best deserve recognition for their atmospheric treatment of orientalist subjects, others that have survived are variable in quality.<br>
<br>In the 1870s Dillon became concerned for the Islamic monuments of Cairo, especially its domestic houses, which were then suffering wholesale destruction from the modernization of the city; he joined others, such as J. D. Crace, R. P. Spiers, and Stanley Lane-Poole, in efforts to study and preserve this heritage. The watercolour and gouache sketches that he made in Cairo, particularly those that depict specific and identified domestic interiors&#151;to which few other European artists had access&#151;are his most individual and distinctive works. They are now considered his most significant contribution to the British orientalist tradition; examples are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Several of these interiors were later worked up for exhibition and were well received by the critics: such, for example, were <span class="italic">The Harem of a Wealthy Arab, Cairo</span> (exh. Dudley Gallery, 1875) and <span class="italic">Hareem of Sheikh Sad&acirc;t</span> (exh. Dudley Gallery, 1876; probably related to <span class="italic">Ka'ah in the Harem of Sheykh Sadat</span>, Searight collection, V&amp;A). Seven were reproduced in G. Ebers's <span class="italic">Egypt: Descriptive, Historical and Picturesque</span> (1878&#150;9). Dillon brought several Islamic artefacts back to London, and created an Arab studio in his house in Upper Phillimore Gardens.<br>
<br>Dillon was one of the first Western artists to visit Japan, travelling there in 1875 via North America. He spent a year based in Osaka with his son, but also sketched the scenery in other parts of the country. On his return he exhibited Japanese subjects, such as <span class="italic">The Stray Shuttlecock</span> (V&amp;A), at the Royal Academy and the Dudley Gallery. He brought home several Japanese curios and his appreciation of the arts of Japan enabled him to write an introduction to the catalogue for an exhibition of Japanese and Chinese art works held at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1878; two years later he published <span class="italic">Sketches by Japanese Artists</span>. He also became a member of the council of the Japan Society.<br>
<br>Dillon's interest in conservation was not confined to Egypt: in 1880 he joined an international committee to assist the progress of the restoration of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, and six years later he participated in the controversy over the effects of light and environmental conditions on watercolours. In the 1890s he opposed the construction of the Nile dam at Aswan which would result in the submergence of the temples at Philae.<br>
<br>As a young man Dillon was sympathetic to the ideas behind the revolutions of 1848. He knew Giuseppe Mazzini during his exile in England&#151;almost certainly as a result of his connections with the Ashurst family, notable for their liberal tendencies&#151;and also assisted some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolution. His marriage produced two daughters, Georgina and Mary, and a son, Edward, but his wife died in 1860&#151;which possibly contributed to his frequent travelling&#151;and his elder daughter also predeceased him. He died at 13 Upper Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, on 2 May 1909.<br>
