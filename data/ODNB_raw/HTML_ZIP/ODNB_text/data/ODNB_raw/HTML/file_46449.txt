<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leighton,  Clara Ellaline Hope <span class="st"> [Clare]</span></span>  (1898&#150;1989), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 12 April 1898 at 40 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, London, the second of the three children of Robert Leighton (1858&#150;1934), a writer and journalist, and his wife, Marie (1865/6&#150;1941), a writer of romantic fiction who was the daughter of Captain James Connor.<br>
<br>Clare Leighton, whose education was largely private, began painting as a child under the guidance of her father and his brother Jack, a professional artist. After the family's move to Keymer, Sussex, in 1915, she attended classes at Brighton College of Art, and between 1922 and 1923 studied painting under Sir Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Fine Art, and wood-engraving under Noel Rooke at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London. Attracted by the medium's wide range of effects, she thereafter practised mainly as a wood-engraver, supporting herself by teaching art in schools until she could earn a living as an illustrator. Her first subjects were farmers and bargees at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, the market town to which the Leightons moved in the early 1920s, and working-class people remained a preferred theme after she left home for Bloomsbury, London, around 1923&#151;the year in which her work was first seen at the annual exhibition of the Society of Wood Engravers.<br>
<br>In 1924 Leighton showed her prints to the radical journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32033/', "Henry Noel Brailsford (1873&#150;1958)")</script>, who published examples in the <span class="italic">New Leader</span> in April of that year. Further engravings appeared in the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span> and <span class="italic">The Forum</span> between 1925 and 1926. Leighton's technique was refined in sketches of landscapes and peasants made on trips to France, Italy, and the Balkans between 1923 and 1927, and she returned from America in 1925 with enough illustrating contracts to occupy her for several years. Independent prints (always signed &#145;Clare Leighton&#146;) and illustrations for Thornton Wilder (in <span class="italic">Bridge of San Luis Rey</span>, 1929) and Thomas Hardy, an author for whom she felt a special affinity (in <span class="italic">The Return of the Native</span>, 1929), earned her a reputation on both sides of the Atlantic, and by 1930, the year in which she gained first prize at the International Engravers Exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, she was an associate member of both the Society of Wood Engravers and the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers. A selection of her work, <span class="italic">Woodcuts</span>, introduced by Hilaire Belloc, was published in 1930.<br>
<br>In 1927 Clare Leighton moved to accommodation near Brailsford's Hampstead flat. Brailsford, separated from his alcoholic wife, was twenty-five years her senior, but Leighton shared the left-wing politics of his circle and found intellectual stimulus and fulfilment in the relationship. Her oil portrait of Mohandas Gandhi (1931) marks one of the points at which their paths crossed. At their joint home, Four Hedges, near Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire, to which they moved in 1931, Leighton engraved her <span class="italic">Lumber Camp</span> series (1931), the well-known <span class="italic">Bread Line, New York</span> (an example of social realism, 1932), and several single engravings for American print clubs. But the major projects from the 1930s are three books she wrote as well as illustrated: <span class="italic">The Farmer's Year</span> (1933), a sombre vision of life on the land at a time of agricultural depression; the phenomenally successful <span class="italic">Four Hedges</span> (1935), a personal chronicle of a year in her Chiltern garden; and <span class="italic">Country Matters</span> (1937), a nostalgic celebration of English rural life on the eve of the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1939 Leighton left Brailsford to begin a new life in the United States, where she became a citizen in 1945. She travelled widely in her adopted country, observing the American way of life at first hand, and finally settled at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 1943. In the English edition of her <span class="italic">Southern Harvest</span> (1943) she declared that &#145;the true character of a people is to be found in its workers&#146;  (p. 6), an idea also explored in engravings for <span class="italic">North Carolina Folklore</span> (1952&#150;64), a survey published by Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, where she was visiting lecturer from 1943 to 1945. The many commissions postdating her 1951 move to Woodbury, Connecticut, include engravings for <span class="italic">The Book of Psalms</span> (1952); <span class="italic">Where Land Meets Sea</span> (1954), a tribute to the Cape Cod tideline she loved; and an illustrated edition of the works of Henry David Thoreau (1961). In her later years she turned from wood-engraving, which makes exacting demands on the eyes, to stained-glass (notably in the transept windows for St Paul's Cathedral, Worcester, installed 1962) and mosaic (<span class="italic">Christ Rising from the Earth</span>, for the chapel of the Holy Family of Nazareth Community, Monroe, Connecticut, 1966&#150;7). In 1988, on account of failing health, Leighton moved into a nursing home. She died, unmarried, on 4 November 1989, and her ashes were buried at Waterbury cemetery, Connecticut.<br>
<br>Convinced that wood-engraving was an art for the masses rather than for an &eacute;lite, Clare Leighton worked independently of the private presses. Her popular success was founded on a disciplined technique, powerful compositions, and a gravity of content and sincerity of feeling that derives from artists such as Samuel Palmer. &#145;No one in our time&#146;, wrote Eric Gill in Gollancz's publicity leaflet for <span class="italic">The Farmer's Year</span>, &#145;has succeeded better in presenting the nobility of massiveness and breadth of life of the earth on a scale so grand.&#146; The artist herself, who possessed a gift for friendship with people of all races and classes, was influential as a teacher, lecturer, and author of two respected texts: <span class="italic">Wood-Engravings and Woodcuts</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">Wood-Engravings of the 1930s</span> (1936).<br>
