<span class="headword">Kemp,  Joseph</span>  (1778&#150;1824), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born in Exeter. He was the brother of James Kemp, the author of the poem <span class="italic">Northernhay</span> (1808). Kemp was a chorister at Exeter Cathedral and a pupil of William Jackson during and after his time in the choir. In 1802 he was appointed organist of Bristol Cathedral, a post he retained until 1807, when he resigned and settled in London. He had married the daughter of Henry John of Cornwall in 1805. In London he sold music at a warehouse at 43 Old Bond Street between 1807 and 1809 and edited the monthly <span class="italic">Musical Magazine, Review and Register</span> from 1809 to 1810. He took his MusB degree at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1808, submitting a war anthem, &#145;A Sound of Battle is in the Land&#146; (composed 1803), as his exercise. He became MusD in 1809 with an anthem entitled <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span>.<br>
<br>Kemp produced a couple of pieces for the theatre in London in 1809 and 1810, and in 1810 began a series of public lectures on musical education, in which he advocated, perhaps for the first time in England, the teaching of music in classes and the playing of exercises by pupils in concert. These were given at the Russell Institution, Great Coram Street, Russell Square, and formed the basis of <span class="italic">The new system of musical education, being a self instructor and serviceable companion to music masters</span> (<i>c</i>.1821) and <span class="italic">Upwards of 100 cards, containing more than 500 points in music, connected with the new system of musical education</span> (<i>c</i>.1821). Kemp's non-pedagogical works include songs, glees, chants, anthems, <span class="italic">Sonatas or Lessons for the Pianoforte</span> (<i>c</i>.1814), and <span class="italic">Musical Illustrations of the Beauties of Shakespeare</span> (<i>c</i>.1820).<br>
<br>Kemp is reported to have lived at 20 Kenton Street, Russell Square, in 1811. In 1814, on account of failing health, he returned with his wife and family to Exeter, where he founded a music college and resided until 1824, although he spent the period 1818&#150;21 in France. A journey to London in April 1824 proved too much for Kemp, then in a weak state of health, and he had a relapse &#145;of his former complaint, and after acute suffering in his head for upwards of three weeks&#146;  (Kassler, 1.626) died in his lodgings on 22 May. He left a widow, two sons, and a daughter.<br>
