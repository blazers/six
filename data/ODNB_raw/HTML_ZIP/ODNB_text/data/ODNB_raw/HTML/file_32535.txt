<span class="headword">Conway,  Robert Seymour</span>  (1864&#150;1933), <span class="occ">classical scholar and philologist</span>, was born at Stoke Newington, London, on 20 September 1864, the eldest son of Samuel Conway, Congregational minister, and his wife, Amy Curling. He was educated at the City of London School under Edwin Abbott, from whom he learned accuracy in detail, an interest in comparative philology, and a broad outlook on literature. After proceeding to Cambridge as a scholar of Gonville and Caius College, he obtained first classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1885, 1887). He was distinguished in part two for an essay, later published as <span class="italic">Verner's Law in Italy</span> (1887).<br>
<br>In 1887 Conway was appointed classical lecturer at Newnham College, Cambridge, where he met Margaret Mary, daughter of William Hall, an ironmaster in the midlands, whom he married in 1891. They had one son and four daughters. Shortly after this appointment he was elected a fellow of Gonville and Caius. In 1893 he became professor of Latin at University College, Cardiff, and in 1903 Hulme professor of Latin in the University of Manchester, where he remained until his resignation in 1929. He improved the teaching of Latin and established a final honours examination in Latin alone.<br>
<br>In 1897 Conway published <span class="italic">The Italic Dialects</span> (2 vols.), which was followed after many years by <span class="italic">The Prae-Italic Dialects of Italy</span> (with Joshua Whatmough and Elizabeth Johnson, 3 vols., 1933). While at Manchester he undertook an edition of Livy. He set about his task with enthusiasm and examined many manuscripts, especially in Italy. Three successive volumes were published (books i&#150;v, 1914; vi&#150;x, 1919; xxi&#150;xxv, 1929) in collaboration with William Charles Flamstead Walters, after whose death he produced a fourth volume (books xxvi&#150;xxx, published posthumously, 1935), with the help of Stephen Keymer Johnson. The work is very thorough, providing copious information about variant readings in the manuscripts.<br>
<br>Conway's other great interest was in Virgil: or, as he always insisted on spelling it, &#145;Vergil&#146;. In 1907 he published in collaboration with J. B. Mayor and William Warde Fowler a small but important book, <span class="italic">The Messianic Eclogue</span>; and many papers on Virgilian subjects followed, including an attempt to find a new site for Virgil's farm (<span class="italic">Where was Vergil's Farm?</span>, 1923). The edition of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, book i, published in 1935 after his death by his son Geoffrey Seymour Conway is perhaps his happiest piece of work, for it combines all his main interests.<br>
<br>Conway was an accurate scholar in his own fields, but they were somewhat limited. He never lectured or wrote on a Greek author, and outside Livy, Virgil, and Cicero his acquaintance with Latin authors was not comprehensive. But he had great enthusiasms and a power of instigating his pupils to research on their own account. His frequent visits to Italy gave him a deep love of the country, and it was a high pleasure to him when in 1929 he was made commander of the order of the Crown of Italy. Among other distinctions he received honorary degrees from the universities of Dublin (1921), Padua (1922), and Oxford (1928); and he was elected an honorary fellow of Gonville and Caius College in 1920 and a fellow of the British Academy in 1918. He was a founder of the Classical Association, and its president in 1927. He died at 4 Dorset Square, London, on 28 September 1933.<br>
