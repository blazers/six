<span class="headword">Travis,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 13 December 1741 at Shaw, Lancashire, the only son of John Travis of Heyside and his wife, Hannah. He was educated by his uncle Benjamin Travis, incumbent of Royton, Lancashire. He entered Manchester grammar school in January 1756 and St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar, on 17 April 1761, where he matriculated that Michaelmas. He was also admitted at the Middle Temple on 4 May 1761. Having graduated BA in 1765 (fifth senior optime and chancellor's classical medallist) he was ordained deacon on 3 March of that year and priest on 22 December; he commenced MA in 1768. He married, on 29 July 1766 at Manchester collegiate church, Ann Stringfellow, daughter and coheir of James Stringfellow of Whitfield, Derbyshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>Travis's preferments were all in Cheshire: he was vicar of Eastham (1766&#150;97), perpetual curate of Bromborough (1767&#150;97), and rector of Handley (1787&#150;97). Having spent some &pound;2000 on legal actions to secure and augment the emoluments of Eastham and Bromborough he was not surprisingly &#145;familiarly acquainted with the law of tithes&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 433). He was appointed prebendary of Chester on 9 February 1783 and archdeacon on 27 September 1786. The title-page of his <span class="italic">Letters to Edward Gibbon, Esq.</span> (1784) describes him also as chaplain to the dowager viscountess&#151;and <i>ci-devant</i> socialite&#151;Etheldreda Townshend. The second edition (1785) omits this detail.<br>
<br>Travis's <span class="italic">Letters</span>, three of which the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> first published in 1782, attacked Gibbon for discrediting the &#145;three heavenly witnesses&#146;  (<span class="roman">1 John</span> 5: 7). This disputed verse, commonly accepted as a matter of Christian faith, was indefensible on manuscript evidence, as Travis, if so disposed, could have learned from Wettstein, Michaelis, or Griesbach.<br>
<br>It was Travis's misfortune to be answered by Richard Porson, in his subsequently reprinted letters to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1788&#150;90), and later by Herbert Marsh. Travis's scholarship was derivative and careless, his manner overweening. Porson made a fool of him. But he persevered; on 3 May 1791 Porson wrote, &#145;Mr. Travis is gone to Paris to examine Greek MSS. for the use, I suppose, of his third Edition&#146;  (R. Porson, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. H. R. Luard, 1867, 49). After Travis's return that edition was delayed until 1794&#151;so the preface mysteriously ends&#151;by &#145;<i>another employment, different in its kind, yet important in its nature and consequences</i>&#146;. Travis died on 24 February 1797 at Hampstead, where he had moved for its healthy air, and was buried there on 6 March. There is a monument to him in Chester Cathedral.<br>
