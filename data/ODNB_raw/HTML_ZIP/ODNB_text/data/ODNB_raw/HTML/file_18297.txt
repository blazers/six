<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Massey, Sir  Edward</span>  (1604<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1674), <span class="occ">parliamentarian and royalist army officer</span>, was the fourth of eleven sons of John Massey of Coddington, Cheshire, and Anne (<i>b</i>. 1582), daughter of Richard Grosvenor of Eaton, Cheshire. The family were long-established minor gentry with various estates in Coddington and Bechin. Two younger brothers, George and Robert, served under Edward's command in Gloucester and he also had seven sisters. He never married. Much of the early evidence about Massey is uncertain because it derives from Clarendon, who detested him, but other sources concur that he saw military service in the Low Countries. In the bishops' wars of 1639&#150;40 he served as a captain of pioneers under Colonel William Legge. According to a later diatribe &#145;hee had not 12<i>d</i>. some time in his pockett to pay for his dinner&#146;  (Firth, 2.159). Clarendon says that he was with the king's forces in York in June 1642 but, despairing of preferment, went to London and was appointed lieutenant-colonel to the earl of Stamford's regiment. Massey himself later wrote that he had initially been uncertain when both king and parliament seemed to profess the same beliefs, but was convinced by parliament's declarations that it never intended to alter government by king, Lords, and Commons and had taken up arms to defend the king's authority and its own privileges, punish evil counsellors and restore pure worship to the church by removing superstitious practices. He remained a rigid presbyterian throughout his career, adhering equally firmly to the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, the protestation, and the covenant.<h2>
<a name="GovernorofGloucester16421645"></a>Governor of Gloucester, 1642&#150;1645</h2>In the autumn of 1642 Massey marched with Stamford to Gloucester, and was left behind with one regiment when Stamford continued into Devon. Although not officially appointed governor until June 1643 he worked closely from the outset with the strongly parliamentarian aldermen of the city and the local deputy lieutenants in the military government of Gloucester. When Prince Rupert sacked Cirencester on 2 February 1643 this also shattered the self-defence forces which had been raised locally before Massey's arrival and made Gloucester the sole focus of the local parliamentarian cause. From now until May 1645 Massey defended the city against a wide array of royalist commanders from within and outside the county. Although Gloucester was vital to parliament's cause Massey rarely had much practical help and the garrison became notorious for hard service and bad pay. His dashing leadership and the general belief that the defence of Gloucester was the turning point of the war brought him hagiographic treatment from the press&#151;notably in the account by his personal chaplain, John Corbet, which was first published in 1647. In March 1643 Massey's troops joined Waller's army and overwhelmed Lord Herbert's Welsh forces at Highnam Court, taking 1500 prisoners. They then cleared the Forest of Dean and recaptured Tewkesbury.<br>
<br>Despite being worsted by Prince Maurice at Ripple Field on 12 April, Massey took Hereford in May. However, after the royalists stormed Bristol in July, Gloucester became totally isolated. Massey's conduct before the siege is the most controversial aspect of his career. Clarendon says that his former commander William Legge sent him a cordial message and that, while publicly roaring defiance, Massey intimated that he would not fight against the king in person. This swayed the debate and on 10 August the king's army appeared before the walls. Massey wrote to the Commons of his lack of men and the treacherous inclinations of the citizens. It appears that he was seeking to save his skin whatever the outcome, but in the event, he signed Gloucester's defiant answer to Charles's summons and led a sturdy defence. The royalists besieged the town until forced to retreat when the earl of Essex's army arrived on 5 September. By then the garrison was down to three barrels of powder and its numbers were shrinking rapidly. Massey was voted &pound;1000 plus all his arrears in thanks. He probably never received either. Throughout the winter he was desperately short of men and money, and subject to constant alarums from royalists forces on all sides. He fought at least fourteen minor battles between November and April as he sought to enlarge the garrison's quarters. Finally, after a relief convoy slipped through with &pound;8000 and large amounts of material, Massey took the offensive. In April he drove Sir John Winter's forces from the Forest of Dean and marched into Herefordshire. He then doubled back to take Beverstone Castle through the governor's treachery on 21 May, then Malmesbury and, on 4 June, Tewkesbury. With Waller's help, Sudeley Castle was reduced on 9 June.<br>
<br>Just as the military situation was improving, however, Massey became embroiled in a vicious feud with most of the Gloucestershire county committee, which both sides pursued locally and through parliament over the next year. The initial focus was control of the two new regiments that were raised in the associated counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and south Wales. Massey believed that some committeemen were trying to raise Sheriff Thomas Stephens's horse under their own authority while systematically starving the regiments he controlled of pay and men. While there was an overlap in authority between Massey and the deputy lieutenants&#151;which he hoped to have resolved by an ordinance confirming him as governor&#151;this was mainly a clash of personalities. Massey's enemies included both conservatives like Isaac Bromwich and radicals like Alderman Thomas Pury and William Sheppard, later Cromwell's law reformer. He had also squabbled with his future political ally Waller over the allocation of money when both forces were in Gloucestershire. Massey's letters to the committee of both kingdoms, the Harleys and Sir Samuel Luke, which chronicled the feud throughout, are shrill, petulant, and self-pitying in tone.<br>
<br>None the less, despite this and his being barely in control of the mutinous troops, Massey continued to fend off the royalists. Colonel Mynne was defeated and killed at Redmarley on 2 August, after which Massey went briefly to London to pursue his case against the committee. On his return he marched first towards Bath, then drove Langdale's Northern horse from around Corse Lawn, destroyed Winter's naval station at Beachley and took Monmouth on 24 September. Beachley had to be retaken, after being abandoned for lack of men to garrison it, on 14 October; Massey's headpiece was knocked off by a musket-butt during the assault. In November, when Massey was ordered away to Oxfordshire, Monmouth was lost again, which sparked off more bitter recriminations on both sides. Only in February 1645, when royalists trapped Stephens's forces at Rawden House, Wiltshire, and forced him to surrender, was the feud somewhat defused. In March, Massey defeated Winter at Lancaut and moved into Herefordshire. Although beaten by Rupert at Ledbury on 22 April (he later wrote that he and Rupert had shot each other's horses from under them, though neither knew it at the time), he withdrew in good order and flushed Winter out of the Forest of Dean, then stormed Evesham on 26 May.<h2>
<a name="Presbyterianleader16451649"></a>Presbyterian leader, 1645&#150;1649</h2>In the same month, after repeatedly requesting to leave Gloucester, Massey was appointed general of the western association forces. He helped in the relief of Taunton on 29 June and routed Porter's horse at Ilminster on 8 July when the royalists tried to surprise Taunton again. He took part in the battle of Langport two days later and the storming of Bridgwater on 23 July, then returned to Taunton to blockade Goring. He spent the winter reducing the few remaining royalist garrisons in the west as Fairfax swept away the field armies. His men committed major disorders in Dorset, Wiltshire, and Somerset. Massey was already a known enemy of the Independent party in parliament and the army, and some hoped to use his brigade as a counterweight to the New Model. For this reason the disbandment of his troops became a major issue after May 1646, but obstacles were continually put in the way until Fairfax finally disbanded them at Devizes in October. On 18 June 1646 Massey took his seat in the Commons as member for Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Thanks to his popularity in London and his enduring military reputation Massey rapidly became an influential figure in parliament. He was appointed lieutenant-general to command the army in Ireland on 2 April 1647, but the troops strongly opposed this. With Waller and others he vainly tried to persuade them to enlist at Saffron Walden. On 6 June he rode the streets of London urging the citizens to defend themselves against the madmen in the army who sought to put the best men in parliament and the city to death. When the army arrived on 16 June the officers laid articles of impeachment for high treason against eleven MPs, including Massey, for trying to start a new civil war. To let matters cool down, these &#145;eleven members&#146; withdrew temporarily. In late July, with the presbyterians briefly in control again, he was named to the reconstituted committee of safety and as commander of the 40,000 men the city proposed to raise. However, on 3 August, London capitulated. Massey and Poyntz fled to the Netherlands from where they published a vindication, reciting their past services, justifying their withdrawal and vowing to return to settle the peace and restore the covenant to religion. Massey and his past were the subject of heated argument in the London mercuries at this time. From some of these we have the only extant descriptions of him. One says that he was &#145;of a sanguine complexion, of a middle age, brown trizld hair&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Speedy Hue and Crie after Generall Massie</span>), while a satirical skit attributed to Lilburne describes &#145;A strange fat unlickt, [s]mall-faced fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Generall Massey's Bartholomew Fairings for Collonell Poynts and the London Reformadoes</span>). Now, and again later, Massey was accused of amassing vast riches by extorting money from Gloucestershire royalists and embezzling moneys raised from taxation and other sources. These allegations are unproved; for his part, Massey complained that he never received the &pound;1000 per year plus lands and iron mills voted to him from Winter's estates at various times. He was back in England by August 1648, when certain presbyterians planned to put him at the head of a body of infantry to be raised to restore Charles I. He was secluded from the Commons and imprisoned in St James's after Pride's Purge on 6 December, but on 18 January 1649 he slipped out by an open door and escaped to the Netherlands.<h2>
<a name="Royalistexile16491660"></a>Royalist exile, 1649&#150;1660</h2>Here, Clarendon was later to grouse, Massey presented himself to Charles II &#145;with as much confidence, and as a sufferer for the King his father, as if he had defended Colchester&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.467). Shortly before going abroad he penned another personal vindication, professing his fidelity to the original principles of the parliamentarian cause and calling the regicides the vilest of traitors. With the other presbyterian exiles in the Netherlands, Massey established contact with Charles II soon after Charles's return from Scotland in October 1649. His estates were consequently sequestered. In December he encountered the council of state's agent, Sir Walter Strickland, who wrote of Massey's vain attempts to dissuade locally resident members of the West India Company from taking the engagement: &#145;truly I have not seen a man thrust himself into a business with less advantage than he did. It seems that he had rather play at a small game than stand out&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 3.144). Massey later joined Charles II in Scotland, served as lieutenant-general of the duke of Buckingham's horse regiment and as governor of Kirkcaldy, and took part in the battle of Inverkeithing on 20 July 1651. As Charles's army marched towards Lancashire he sent Massey to rally the local presbyterian gentry. With the earl of Derby, Massey addressed a meeting at Warrington on 18 August, urging them to put past differences aside, but they found little practical support. He rejoined Charles at Stoke next day and volunteered to raise support in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. Fighting with his customary tenacity to defend a house he had fortified near Upton Bridge, he was badly wounded in the thigh, arm and hand by &#145;rag-shot&#146; on 28 August and was too ill to take any part in the battle of Worcester. Afterwards, he fled as far as Droitwich but, unable to keep up, parted from Charles and threw himself on the mercy of the countess of Stamford at Broadgate Manor, Leicestershire. Here his wounds were treated&#151;they were so severe that a deathbed declaration was published in his name&#151;but he was kept a prisoner. On 24 November Lord Grey sent him to London. He tried to escape by spurring his horse away, but was recaptured and confined in the Tower. The Rump had earlier listed him among eleven who should face trial for treason, but clemency prevailed after Derby's execution. Massey survived to escape to the Netherlands again on 30 August 1652, this time out of a chimney.<br>
<br>Charles II trusted Massey implicitly. He apparently called Massey &#145;my dear and faithful friend&#146; at a tearful farewell during the retreat from Worcester  (Ormerod, 2.739), and regarded him as a useful link to the presbyterians. Massey was twice in England on such business, in 1654 and 1656, as well as in Denmark in 1655. To many other royalists, his past and his character counted against him; Clarendon thought him &#145;a wonderfully vain, weak man&#146;, though he acknowledged Massey's courage and devotion  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.144). From late 1658 Massey became more actively involved in royalist plotting. He returned to London on 5 March 1659 and in May went west to revive faltering plans for an uprising in Gloucestershire. He spent most of the next three months in hiding with the Veel family in Symondshall, distributing commissions and drumming up support among local gentlemen and presbyterian clergymen for a rising on Gloucester. From the outset, this was hampered by internal divisions. Lord Mordaunt, who was co-ordinating the plot, relied mainly on the ultra-cautious John Howe, and Massey frequently complained that Mordaunt and Howe were ruining his best efforts. Some support was raised in the Stroudwater clothing district and the Forest of Dean and the rising was planned for 1 August. However, the rebel activity was all too obvious and Sir Richard Willis had betrayed much detail to the government. The Gloucester militia seized Massey and others on 31 July, and the risings here and around Bath fizzled out. While being brought over Nympsfield Hill to Gloucester at dusk, Massey contrived yet another improbable escape by making his horse stumble, rolling downhill and fleeing in the dark. He spent the next few months in the Southern Netherlands and Holland, preparing to return. On 14 January 1660 Charles commissioned Massey to return to England, authorizing him to use his own judgement as to where to act but urging him to revive the Bristol and Gloucester business if possible. He arrived by 27 January. Again friction arose because Mordaunt appointed Howe commander-in-chief above him and again Clarendon had to smooth things over. Massey was in the Bristol area in early February seeking to promote the rising, then returned to London to agitate for the readmittance of the MPs secluded at Pride's Purge. Events rapidly overtook him, though, and he did little more than report on national events and complain.<h2>
<a name="Thelateryears16601674"></a>The later years, 1660&#150;1674</h2>On Monck's advice Massey went to Gloucester to seek election to the Convention Parliament in March. Despite opposition from some citizens and garrison troops, which led to scuffling as Massey went to dine with the mayor on 30 March, he was made a freeman and elected. He was arrested, but the Convention subsequently acquitted him of causing the riot. He worked intensively for the king's restoration in the Convention, putting forward motions to take down republican insignia and to increase the king's supply to &pound;50,000 per annum. He was voted &pound;1,944 6<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. plus interest for his past arrears and expenses and took command of Twiselton's regiment until its disbandment in October. Charles knighted him at Canterbury on 27 May. In December he was granted a further &pound;3000 from the excise. He was again elected for Gloucester in the Cavalier Parliament in April 1661. Presumably for this reason he did not take up the governorship of Jamaica which the king had earmarked for him in September 1660 at the request of the merchant adventurers. Massey was a moderately active MP, serving on 110 committees over the next fourteen years. He spent much time in Ireland between 1661 and 1664, after receiving a command in the Irish army and a grant of an estate on very favourable terms at Abbey Leix, now in Queen's county. He may have lost favour for trying to defend the Gloucester corporation when it was purged in 1662&#150;3 under the <span class="roman">Act for the Well Governing and Regulation of Corporations</span>, for he never again held any significant posts. During the Second Dutch War he served in the Dover prize office and as the commander of auxiliary troops. Just as in Gloucester twenty years before, he was popular with the townsfolk but appears to have alienated many of the town council. In 1673 he spoke in support of bills to ease restrictions on protestant dissenters and backed Lord Arran's complaints of Catholic worship going unchecked in Ireland after the declaration of indulgence. He died in Ireland between 6 February 1674, when he last spoke in parliament, and 30 May, when his will was proved, and was buried at Abbey Leix.<br>
<br>Massey rose from obscurity through a mixture of outstanding qualities of military leadership, courage, sheer luck, and a talent for publicizing himself. The successful defence of Gloucester made him a nationally important figure. However, he was ill at ease in the world into which his success thrust him. Rigid, self-righteous, humourless, and paranoid to the point where his very sanity might be questioned, he was unable to work with others and invariably annoyed allies and enemies alike. It was largely because of his character defects that he never really scaled the military and political heights. Conversely, his courage, doggedness, and consistent devotion to his version of the cause of 1642 made him too useful to ignore, and he was never far from the public spotlight.<br>
