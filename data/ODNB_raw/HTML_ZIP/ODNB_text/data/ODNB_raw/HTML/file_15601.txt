<span class="headword">King,  Thomas</span>  (1835&#150;1888), <span class="occ">pugilist</span>, was born in Silver Street, Stepney, on 14 August 1835, and as a youth served before the mast both in the navy and in a trading vessel. About 1858 he obtained a position as foreman of labourers at the Victoria docks. His courage in disposing of a dock bully known as Brighton Bill commended him to the notice of the ex-champion Jem Ward, who coached him with gloves at The George in Ratcliffe Highway. On 27 November 1860, on the Kentish marshes, King beat Tommy Truckle of Portsmouth in forty-nine rounds (sixty-two minutes). He was now taken in hand and trained by Nat Langham at The Feathers, Wandsworth, for a contest with William Evans (Young Broome). The betting of two to one on King was justified by the event on 21 October 1861, after a long fight interrupted by the police at the seventeenth round, but then resumed until the forty-third.<br>
<br>The fight between the Young Sailor, as King was called, and the &#145;scientific&#146; Jem Mace of Norwich, the national champion, had a different outcome: King was outclassed after displaying the utmost pluck in a contest of sixty-eight minutes (28 January 1862). A return match, which excited much greater interest, took place at Aldershot (26 November 1862). The betting was seven to four on Mace, who had the best of the fighting, but was knocked out by a single blow, a &#145;terrific cross-counter on the left cheek&#146;, in the nineteenth round. In this battle of thirty-eight minutes King had shown himself a glutton for punishment, of a &#145;bottom&#146; and endurance worthy of the best traditions of the ring.<br>
<br>King now married and announced his intention of leaving the ring, thus acquiescing in the resumption of the championship by Mace. But he was yet to champion England against America in the great fight with the Benicia Boy, John Camel Heenan, the adversary of Tom Sayers. The ring was pitched at Wadhurst, near Tunbridge Wells, at an early hour on 10 December 1863. King weighed a little below 13 stone, Heenan (much the favourite) just over 14; both were over 6 feet in height. Heenan's game was to close in and wrestle his antagonist to the ground. King's consisted of dealing his adversary a series of sledge-hammer blows on his nose. Both were extremely successful in their respective tactics, and in the absence of the orthodox feinting, sparring, and &#145;science&#146;, the result came to be mainly a question of sheer endurance. At the eighteenth round the tide of victory turned in King's favour. At the close of the twenty-fourth round, after nearly forty minutes' fighting, Heenan lay unconscious and his seconds threw up the sponge. Public anxiety as to his condition was allayed by a medical report in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (12 December). Both combatants appeared in person at Wadhurst, in answer to a summons, on 22 December, when they were bound over to keep the peace, and both King and Heenan agreed never to fight again in Britain. King, having won about &pound;4000 in stakes and presents, fulfilled his promise to the letter. He subsequently set up as a bookmaker in Tulse Hill and Hastings and became a wealthy man. He also invested in barge property.<br>
<br>In 1867 King won a couple of sculling races on the Thames, but in later years was best-known for his success in metropolitan flower shows. He died of bronchitis at Clarence House, Clarence Road, Clapham, on 4 October 1888, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Jane Elizabeth, and at least one daughter. After 1863 the vigilance of the police confined bare-knuckle pugilism in England more and more to the disreputable and dangerous classes, and Tom King is thus not incorrectly termed by the historian of the English prize-ring as Ultimus Romanorum.<br>
