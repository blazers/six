<span class="headword">Faber,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1695&#150;1756), <span class="occ">engraver and portrait and miniature painter</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9052/', "John Faber (d. 1721)")</script>, also an engraver, was born in Amsterdam about 1695. His family settled in England at some time before 1698 and a drawing by his father, dated 1704 and now in the British Museum, shows Faber as a child. He learned drawing and mezzotint engraving from his father and subscribed to the academy in St Martin's Lane founded in 1720 by Louis Cheron and John Vanderbank, where he would have drawn from life and at the same time come to know many of the painters whose work he was to engrave. He also frequented the Rose and Crown Club of artists which met in a Covent Garden tavern on Saturday nights from the beginning of the eighteenth century to 1745.<br>
<br>Until his father's death in 1721 Faber published mezzotints under the name John Faber Junior from addresses in London near the Strand: over against Essex Street, at the Blew Ball in Catherine Street, and at the Two Golden Balls near the Savoy. After 1721 he published at Fountain Court in the Strand (<i>c</i>.1721&#150;1725), at the Green Door in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden (late 1720s), at the Green Door in Craven Buildings, Drury Lane (<i>c</i>.1731&#150;<i>c</i>.1734), and at the Golden Head in Bloomsbury Square, South Side (<i>c</i>.1734 onwards). In 1737, while living at the last address, a &#145;street robber at night attacked him near his own house, as he was going home, and shot him in the breast&#151;of which he was dangerously wounded&#151;but recovered&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.80).<br>
<br>Faber produced more than 500 mezzotints: a full catalogue of his portraits can be found in John Chaloner Smith's <span class="italic">British Mezzotinto Portraits</span> (1883). They were mainly portraits after contemporary and seventeenth-century painters. He engraved two important series after Godfrey Kneller&#151;twelve <span class="italic">Hampton Court Beauties</span> (1727), and forty-seven portraits of members of the Kit-Cat Club (1735)&#151;and he helped to secure the international reputations of Thomas Hudson and Allan Ramsay with, respectively, forty-two and fifteen mezzotints after their portraits. In 1742 Vertue remarked that &#145;no sooner is a picture painted by any painter of any remarkable person but presently [Faber] has it out in print, also now or lately he has done some plates drawn from the life without the assistance of a painter&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.109). Among subjects other than portraits Faber made mezzotints after Philip Mercier's paintings of everyday themes in the manner of Chardin. Larger prints, which sold for the relatively high price of 5<i>s</i>., included an equestrian portrait of Frederick, prince of Wales, after Bartholomew Dandridge (1740), dedicated to the masters and wardens of &#145;the Antient Society of Free and Accepted Masons &hellip; by their faithful Brother &hellip; Jno Faber&#146;.<br>
<br>Faber was undoubtedly the leading mezzotint engraver of his day, but his posthumous reputation has been eclipsed by those of James Macardell and other Dublin mezzotint engravers who dominated the medium from the 1750s. Among his apprentices were Andrew Miller and&#151;probably&#151;John Brooks. His wife, whose name is not known, was painted by Thomas Hudson and the portrait was executed in mezzotint by Faber; after Faber's death she married a lawyer named Smith. Faber died, of gout, on 2 May 1756. Fifteen of his plates, including the <span class="italic">Hampton Court Beauties</span>, were acquired by John Boydell and appeared in Boydell's sale of 2 June 1818.<br>
