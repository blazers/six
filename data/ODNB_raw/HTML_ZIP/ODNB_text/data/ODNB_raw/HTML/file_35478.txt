<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perkin,  William Henry</span>  (1860&#150;1929), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born on 17 June 1860 at 1 or 2 Chesham Villas, Sudbury, Middlesex, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35477/', "Sir William Henry Perkin (1838&#150;1907)")</script>, manufacturing chemist, and his first wife, Jemima Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1862), youngest daughter of John Lissett. Having attended two preparatory schools, in 1870 Perkin entered the City of London School where he was stimulated by good teaching in science and mathematics. Simultaneously he worked in his father's private laboratory. Though his father did not give him formal instruction, Perkin imbibed the idea of research as a supreme good. As a boy he followed his father in becoming an accomplished pianist and violinist. In 1877 he migrated to the Royal College of Chemistry, London, where he studied under Edward Frankland and W. R. E. Hodgkinson, head of the laboratories, who had worked under Johannes Wislicenus. After some hesitation by his father, who regarded Germany as a dangerous centre of free thought, Perkin went in 1880 to W&uuml;rzburg to work for a PhD under Wislicenus, a master of syntheses in organic chemistry and an undictatorial paternalist as a supervisor.<br>
<br>Having gained his doctorate in 1882, Perkin spent four years at the University of Munich with Adolf von Baeyer, mainly as a <i>privat Dozent</i> and personal research assistant. Baeyer soon became a chemical hero for Perkin, who was amazed by the excellent laboratories designed by him and impressed by the research productivity achieved by his steadfastness at the laboratory bench. A master of structural organic chemistry, Baeyer was generally indifferent to theory and to the then-new physical chemistry. Above all, Baeyer created by example an atmosphere in which research was the only thing that mattered, so that his research group was outstanding in size, productivity, and endurability. Perkin also saw that over half of Baeyer's researchers went into industry or commerce. In these ways Baeyer provided for Perkin an example to be followed or modified.<br>
<br>In 1886 Perkin accepted an invitation from Harold Dixon, professor of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester, to work in a vacant laboratory there. Next year he became the first professor of chemistry at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, where his assistant was Frederic Stanley Kipping, who had studied under him at Munich. They soon began the collaboration which produced three enduring textbooks, <span class="italic">Practical Chemistry</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Organic Chemistry</span> (1894&#150;5), and <span class="italic">Inorganic Chemistry</span> (1909). On 31 December 1887 Perkin married Mina, the eldest daughter of William Thomas Holland, of Bridgwater. They had met in Manchester in Kipping's home where she was staying with a younger sister, Lily, Kipping's fianc&eacute;e. Elected FRS in 1890 Perkin accepted in 1892 an invitation to succeed Carl Schorlemmer as professor of organic chemistry at Owens College.<br>
<br>At Manchester, Perkin created an internationally renowned school of organic chemistry in which two future Nobel prizewinners, Walter Norman Howarth and Robert Robinson, both Manchester graduates, and the first president of Israel, Chaim Weizmann, were trained. The Perkin group of organic chemists was accommodated in impressive new research laboratories, some of which Perkin designed. He had an enviable knack of being associated with such munificent external endowments as the Schorlemmer Laboratory (1895), the Levinstein Laboratory (1895), the Schunck Laboratory (1904), and the John Morley Laboratories (1909) paid for mainly by Andrew Carnegie. In this greatly expanded accommodation, chiefly devoted to organic chemistry and unrivalled in any British university, Perkin pursued research and consultancies, encouraged pure and technical organic chemistry, and launched his pupils on academic and industrial careers. For Perkin there was no divide between pure and applied chemistry. Though his forte lay in producing academic organic chemists, he was concerned about the British organic chemical industry, which in his view relied too much on rule-of-thumb methods and neglected research because it was obsessed with short-term commercial interests. His solution was to produce trained research chemists for industry and establish co-operation on the German model between industry and universities. He did lucrative commercial work in his university laboratories at Manchester, his final venture being the manufacture of synthetic rubber. The project was marred for Perkin by a fracas with Weizmann, whom he sacked from the rubber team.<br>
<br>In 1912 Perkin was invited by the University of Oxford to become Waynflete professor of chemistry, to rescue the subject from the parlous state to which it had sunk under William Odling. He accepted the chair on the understanding that his main role would be to build up research as rapidly as possible. Aware of Oxford's conservatism, collegiate structure, devotion to arts subjects, suspicion of specialized research, and hostility to industry, Perkin acted resolutely. He maintained his output of research and played a leading role in persuading the university, at a time of national emergency, to add a fourth year of research to the existing degree course in chemistry (1916) and to establish the research degree of DPhil (1917). Exploiting the dire contingency of war, he introduced into Oxford the notion and practice of industrial research, using chemists employed by the government-backed British Dyes and recruited mainly from outside Oxford. He persuaded Charles William Dyson Perrins, partner in the famous Worcestershire Sauce firm, to pay two-thirds of the cost of the first stage of a new chemical laboratory completed in 1916 and then, with an entrepreneurial wiliness bordering on deception, induced the university to pay for most of the second stage opened in 1922.<br>
<br>In this Indian summer of his career Perkin suffered some disappointments: he had to recruit staff from outside Oxford, very few of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s secured permanent posts at Oxford, and only a handful of Oxford graduates researched with him. Even so he put organic chemistry at Oxford on the international map. His interests in music, horticulture, hospitality, and travel helped to make his aims and practices eventually acceptable in Oxford. At Manchester he was such an accomplished pianist that he played duets with the famous violinist Adolf Brodsky. At his Oxford home Perkin soon removed a partition wall to create a long room for chamber music. To the end of his life he practised at his piano every day before breakfast. For diversion on train journeys he used to read the score of a string quartet. He had green fingers with flowering plants, of which many were donated to the University Parks. He kept a good cellar and gave many parties at Magdalen, his college. In summer he regularly visited the Swiss and Italian lakes. Such connoisseurship, which made him an English version of the best sort of German professor, ended in 1929 when his robust health gave way. Perhaps weakened by strychnine, which he was studying, and by accidental poisoning by mercury vapour, he died at his home, 5 Charlbury Road, Oxford, on 17 September 1929 from pleurisy which affected his heart; he was buried at Wolvercote cemetery near Oxford on 19 September. His will showed his unfaltering commitment to research. His marriage being childless, the bulk of his estate reverted after his wife's death to Magdalen College for research studentships in organic chemistry.<br>
<br>A large, portly man, gruff-voiced and with a bushy moustache in his prime, Perkin was the leading British organic chemist of his generation, being awarded the Longstaff medal of the Chemical Society (1900), of which he was president 1913&#150;15, and the Davy and royal medals of the Royal Society (1904, 1925). With his large hands and spatulate fingers he was a renowned experimentalist who could induce reactions to &#145;go&#146; and gums to crystallize. He was a bench chemist who adored the laboratory and its ineffable art. His field of research was not new or wide: he worked on the determination of the structure of naturally occurring organic substances, using the established techniques of degradation (breaking the substance down into identifiable fragments) and synthesis (making it from chemicals of known composition and structure by a series of controlled reactions whose course was indisputable). He exploited reagents and reactions devised by others, but in his time the Perkin triangle was a piece of apparatus widely used in collecting fractions during distillation under reduced pressure. All his life he suspected that physical chemistry was bogus so he did not use physical methods. Except in his research on synthesizing compounds containing rings composed of three, four, and five atoms of carbon, which confirmed Baeyer's strain theory, he avoided theoretical chemistry.<br>
<br>With a rare combination of ability, enthusiasm, stamina, and guile, Perkin managed to continue at Oxford his Mancunian roles of researcher, research school director, designer of new laboratories, and securer of external funding. His research students and associates regarded him with respect and affection. They had confidence in his fairness and judgement; they admired his honesty, sincerity, and his unaffected large-heartedness, and revered him as &#145;Pa Perkin&#146;. His pupils filled many chairs in British universities, mainly in organic chemistry, the best known being Robinson, his successor at Oxford and closest collaborator, W. N. Haworth, J. L. Simonsen, Kipping, J. F. Thorpe, H. C. H. Carpenter, W. A. Bone, F. L. Pyman, W. O. Kermack, J. Kenyon, G. R. Clemo, J. M. Gulland, R. D. Haworth, and W. Baker. Through them the Perkin gospel dominated British organic chemistry as long as it was concerned with structure, not mechanism, and as long as physical techniques of investigation were not widely employed.<br>
