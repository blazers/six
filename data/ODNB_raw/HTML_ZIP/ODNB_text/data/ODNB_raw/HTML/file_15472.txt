<span class="headword">Kerrison, Sir  Edward</span>, first baronet  (1776&#150;1853), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Staithe House, Bungay, Suffolk, on 30 July 1776, the only son (there was also a daughter) of Matthias Kerrison (1742&#150;1827) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter and heiress of Edward Barnes of Barnham, Suffolk. His father, the son of a yeoman farmer, accumulated a fortune as a merchant and canal owner, and was reckoned to be worth a million pounds at his death, having invested extensively in landed property, including the Hoxne Hall estate in Suffolk. Sir Roger Kerrison (1740&#150;1808), banker and twice mayor of Norwich, was his uncle.<br>
<br>Kerrison entered the army as cornet in the 6th (Inniskilling) dragoons on 23 June 1796, was promoted captain in October 1798, and was transferred to the 7th hussars that year. With the 7th he served in the Helder expedition of 1799, taking part in the actions of 19 September and 2 and 6 October. He was promoted major in 1803, and lieutenant-colonel in 1805. In October 1808 he embarked with the 7th for Spain, and the following December was severely wounded on the plains of Le&oacute;n. He commanded the 7th at the passage of the Oleron, in the action of Sauveterne, and at the battles of Orthez and Toulouse. At the battle of Orthez, the charge headed by Lord Edward Somerset, in which Kerrison with the 7th hussars took the chief part, was highly commended by Wellington. In 1813 he was promoted brevet colonel.<br>
<br>Kerrison served in the 1815 campaign, and was slightly wounded at Waterloo, where his horse was shot under him; but he continued with his regiment, and took part in the occupation of Paris. He was knighted on 5 January 1815; was made CB on 22 June 1815 and KCH in 1821, and created a baronet by patent dated on 27 July 1821; he was made GCH in 1831 and KCB on 18 July 1840. He was tory MP for Shaftesbury from 1812 to 1818, for Northampton from 1818 to 1824, and for Eye, which he had purchased, from 1824 to 1852. He voted against Roman Catholic relief in 1813, 1816, and 1817. Promoted lieutenant-general in 1837, he became a general in 1851.<br>
<br>Kerrison married, on 20 October 1813, Mary Martha (<i>d</i>. 19 April 1860), daughter of Alexander Ellice of Pittencrieff, Fife. They had one son, Edward Clarence Kerrison, second baronet (1821&#150;1886), MP, at whose death the baronetcy became extinct, and three daughters, the second of whom, Emily Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1873), married in 1834 Philip Henry, Viscount Mahon, the historian, afterwards fifth Earl Stanhope. Kerrison died at his house, 13 Great Stanhope Street, London, on 9 March 1853. He was buried at Hoxne Hall, which he had inherited from his father.<br>
