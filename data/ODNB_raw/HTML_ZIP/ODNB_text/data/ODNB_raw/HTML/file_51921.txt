<span class="headword">Maunsell,  Guy Anson</span>  (1884&#150;1961), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 1 September 1884 in Srinagar, India, the second child and only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Henry Maunsell (1837&#150;1913) and Rosalie Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1929) of Guernsey. He was educated at Eastbourne College and then studied engineering at the Central Institution, South Kensington, graduating with honours in 1906.<br>
<br>A man of great vision and energy, Maunsell became an engineering designer of flair and genius. His practical training was gained in Paris and Lausanne during 1907&#150;8. His engineering career began in 1909 when he joined the staff of Easton Gibb &amp; Son, contractors, building the naval base at Rosyth. During 1915&#150;16 he was chief engineer responsible for erecting cordite factories in Ayrshire and west London. In 1917 he served in France as an officer in the Royal Engineers. A year later he was seconded to design and construct a shipyard at Shoreham to build concrete sea-going vessels. After the war he worked with Sir Alexander Gibb, chief engineer at the Ministry of Transport, preparing a tidal power scheme on the River Severn comprising a barrage and combined road and rail bridge. In 1922 he married Millicent Geraldine Mockler, with whom he had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1923, as special assistant to Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners, Maunsell was engaged on the design and layout of Ipswich Dock extensions, Poole harbour, and other works. From 1924 to 1927 he was engineer and agent to Sir William Arrol &amp; Co., working on the Falls of Clyde hydroelectric power scheme. The next three years were spent in private practice and in association with Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners. In 1931 he joined Dorman Long &amp; Co. as agent for the widening of Sir Joseph Bazalgette's Putney Bridge. When this was completed, in 1934, he became managing director of the Anglo-Danish Construction Company, expressly formed to build the Storstrom Bridge in Denmark. Maunsell solved the difficult site erection problem by designing an ingenious floating crane capable of lifting a complete viaduct span in one piece. At the time this was the longest bridge in Europe, some 10,535 feet. The linking of the erection procedure with the design concept was a Maunsell trademark. In 1936 he formed the consulting engineering firm G. Maunsell &amp; Partners, which he headed until his retirement in 1959. In 1940 he was invited to join Sir Alexander Gibb in the restoration of Telford's Menai suspension bridge.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Maunsell's ingenuity was fully utilized in many unusual projects, which later became the inspiration for other civil engineering developments. One was the design and installation of the &#145;Maunsell sea forts&#146;, a series of fortified off-shore tower structures. The Admiralty naval fort in the Thames estuary comprised four towers, each weighing about 4500 tons. They were built of reinforced concrete at Northfleet and then towed out and sunk on site in 1942. This was so successful that an army fort was also installed in the Thames estuary and another in Liverpool Bay. Another wartime project was his design and production of a series of reinforced concrete floating docks for the Admiralty, capable of lifting tugs and minesweepers, but the great civil engineering achievement of the war was the Mulberry harbour, built for the allied landing in Normandy in 1944. Many engineers and Admiralty staff were involved in this project, including Guy Maunsell, who had first proposed a floating breakwater scheme to Admiral Hughes Hallet in 1940.<br>
<br>Maunsell travelled widely throughout his life and used his talent for painting in watercolours to record many of his engineering works. His last major work was the design of a 1000 ft span arch bridge which was being constructed at Gladesville, Sydney, Australia, at the time of his death. Maunsell died on 20 June 1961 at The Orchard, London Road, Southborough, Kent, and was buried at Southborough cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
