<span class="headword">Bowdich,  Thomas Edward</span>  (1791?&#150;1824), <span class="occ">writer and traveller in Africa</span>, was born in Bristol, probably on 20 June 1791, though birth dates of 1790, 1792, and 1793 have also been suggested. His father, Thomas Bowdich, was a hat manufacturer and merchant there, and his mother was one of the Vaughans of Painscastle, Radnorshire. He was educated at Bristol grammar school, and (from the age of nine) at Corsham grammar school, Wiltshire, where he soon became head boy. He was keener on classics than mathematics and was noted for his literary style and his skill as a rider. He was originally intended for the bar, and it was much against his wishes that his father put him to the family trade, and for one year, 1813, he was partner in the firm of Bowdich, Son, and Luce. In the same year on 9 January, at the church of St Mary, Newington, London, he married Sarah, daughter of John Eglonton Wallis, of Colchester [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16310/', "Lee, Sarah")</script>], and entered himself at Oxford, though he never matriculated. In 1814, with the help of his uncle, a Mr Hope Smith, governor-in-chief of the settlements belonging to the Royal African Company, he secured a writership in the service, and subsequently left England for Cape Coast Castle. His wife followed him soon afterwards, but on her arrival she found he had returned to England for a time. In 1816 the African Company planned a mission to the Asante, and initially contemplated appointing Bowdich to lead it. On reaching Cape Coast Castle the second time, he was judged too young and Frederick James (governor of Fort Accra) was appointed to lead the expedition. In the course of the journey, however, Bowdich superseded his chief (a bold step afterwards sanctioned by the authorities), and, through negotiations which subsequently proved controversial, formed a treaty with the king of the Asante, which promised peace to the British settlements on the Gold Coast in return for commercial and political co-operation. In 1818 he returned to England in poor health, and in the following year published a detailed account of his expedition, <span class="italic">A Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee</span>. This work, with its glowing account of Asante society and culture, attracted considerable interest. Bowdich presented a small collection of African objects and specimens to the British Museum.<br>
<br>However, Bowdich's apparent success did not meet with the reward he anticipated. His writings and letters continually speak of unmerited disappointment; the net reward for his great mission amounted to only &pound;200, and it cost him half of this to return home; while a rival, Joseph Dupuis, was appointed consul at Coomassie (Kumasi) with &pound;600 a year. In 1819 he published <span class="italic">The African Committee</span>, an attack on the corruption and inefficiency of the African Company, and the ensuing controversy resulted in the transfer of the company's forts to the crown. Disappointed by his reception in London, Bowdich left for Paris, where studied mathematics, physical science, and natural history. Soon after, he gained the Cambridge prize of &pound;1000 for a discovery which was dependent on mathematics. In Paris, Humboldt, Cuvier, Denon, Biot, and other eminent savants gave Bowdich a generous reception, and a public <i>&eacute;loge</i> was pronounced upon him at the Institut de France. Not only were he and his wife introduced to Cuvier and his circle, but for three years Cuvier's extensive library and splendid collections were made available to them as their own. The French government offered him an appointment on generous terms, which Bowdich felt unable to accept, apparently on patriotic grounds. Early in 1820 he wrote an angry response to &#145;the geographer of the Quarterly Review&#146; (presumably John Barrow) who had published a critical article on his <span class="italic">Mission to Ashantee</span>. His other writings in Paris included a translation of <span class="italic">Travels in the Interior of Africa to the Sources of the Senegal and Gambia, by G. Mollien</span> (1820); an account of <span class="italic">British and Foreign Expeditions to Teembo, with Remarks on Civilization</span> (1821); an <span class="italic">Essay on the Geography of North-Western Africa</span> (1821) accompanied by a large lithographed map, compiled from his own discoveries; and an <span class="italic">Essay on the Superstitions, Customs, and Arts Common to the Ancient Egyptians, Abyssinians, and Ashantees</span> (1821), an audacious study which was the first full-length study of west African culture and history. He also published several works on natural history, including <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Ornithology of Cuvier</span> (1821) and <span class="italic">Elements of Conchology</span> (1822), both illustrated by numerous lithographs prepared by his wife.<br>
<br>The success of these publications enabled Bowdich and his wife to embark upon a second African expedition, and in August 1822 they sailed from Le Havre to Lisbon. Here, from various manuscripts, Bowdich compiled a complete history of all the Portuguese discoveries in south Africa. They continued to Madeira&#151;where they remained for some months, collecting geological, geographical, and botanical information&#151;and then travelled to the Gambia, where Bowdich began a trigonometrical survey of the river. His enthusiasm for scientific observation was said to have cost him his life there, for while taking astronomical observations at night he caught cold, which was followed by fever, resulting in his death, at the early age of thirty-three, on 10 January 1824. The published account of his last expedition was edited and illustrated by his wife.<br>
<br>Though small in stature, Bowdich was an energetic man. He was an excellent linguist, a graphic writer, and an ardent conversationalist. His reputation as a scholar, enhanced by his association with Cuvier and Humboldt, still survived in the late twentieth century. He left a widow and three children, one of them named after the two companions of his Asante mission.<br>
