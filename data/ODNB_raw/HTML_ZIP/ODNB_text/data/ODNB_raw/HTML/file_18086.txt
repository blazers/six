<span class="headword">Marrable,  Frederick</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1819, <em>d.</em> 1872), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 19 January 1819, the son of Sir Thomas Smith Marrable, secretary of the board of green cloth to George IV and William IV, and his wife, Charlotte. He was articled to the architect Edward Blore, and on the expiration of his time studied abroad. On his return he established a small private practice from an office in Lancaster Place, next to Waterloo Bridge, London, but his career did not flourish until 1856, when he was appointed superintending architect to the newly established Metropolitan Board of Works. This difficult office involved the settling of compensation claims, especially in connection with the building of new streets, and the writing of innumerable reports, and through it he gained the esteem of his profession. The main improvements carried out under his superintendency were Garrick Street (1857&#150;61), Southwark Street (1857&#150;64), and Burdett Road (1858&#150;62), which served as part of an improved approach to Victoria Park from Limehouse; he also prepared an unexecuted design for Holborn Viaduct, eventually built in 1864&#150;9 by the city corporation, designed and built the offices of the Metropolitan Board of Works in Spring Gardens, near Trafalgar Square (1860; dem.), but resigned his post in 1861 on the grounds that he was grossly underpaid (the board responded by offering to increase his salary by &pound;200 to &pound;1000, but he refused to reconsider). He was succeeded by George Vulliamy, but continued to work privately for the board on compensation cases. On 2 September 1856 he married the painter Madeline Cockburn (1833&#150;1916) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55632/', "Marrable, Madeline Frances Jane")</script>]; the couple had two children.<br>
<br>Marrable's most important surviving building is the Garrick Club, Garrick Street (1860), a competent essay in the Italian Renaissance manner, which he also employed in the board's offices and in Archbishop Tenison's School in Leicester Square (1869; dem.). He also designed the church of St Peter, Deptford (1866&#150;70), and that of St Mary Magdalen, St Leonards, Sussex (1852; enlarged 1872). Marrable resided at 28 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, and on 22 June 1872 went to Witley in Surrey to inspect the buildings of the Bethlehem Hospital for Convalescents. While thus engaged he was taken ill, and died almost immediately.<br>
