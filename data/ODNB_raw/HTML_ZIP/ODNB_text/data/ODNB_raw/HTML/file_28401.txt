<span class="headword">Wagstaffe,  Thomas</span>  (1692&#150;1770), <span class="occ">clergyman of the nonjuring Church of England and theologian</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28400/', "Thomas Wagstaffe (1645&#150;1712)")</script>, bishop of the nonjuring Church of England, and Martha Broughton (<i>fl</i>. 1687&#150;1692). He was probably educated at home by his father, and became a well-read divine and classical scholar. A superior Latinist, he could speak seven languages besides English, and was an able scholar in Hebrew, Arabic, and Syrian. He was ordained deacon in 1718 and priest on 25 April 1719 by the nonjuror Bishop Jeremy Collier at Roger Laurence's chapel in London. He served the nonjuror community as the keeper of records, succeeding Thomas Deacon. In that capacity he drew up a bibliographical list of tracts concerning the usages controversy within the nonjuror movement. Wagstaffe took over Deacon's congregation at Dunstan's Court, Fleet Street, London, in 1722, serving there for ten years. During that period he acted as London representative for the primus of the usager party, Thomas Brett.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe formed, with his fellow usagers Laurence, Deacon, Francis Peck, John Rutter, and Samuel Jebb, a block that pushed usager party leaders Collier and Brett to emphasize the essential nature of the four usages&#151;the mixed chalice, invocation of the Holy Spirit, oblation, and prayers for the dead&#151;and to break communion with the nonusages party. He contributed several works to the usages controversy, including <span class="italic">The Necessity of an Alteration</span> (1718) and <span class="italic">The Reasonableness and Necessity of some Practices of the Reformation of the Church of England</span> (1720). Wagstaffe carried on a debate with Samuel Drake in Latin over the necessity of a mixed chalice containing both water and wine. In 1719 Drake denounced the practice in a Cambridge University sermon, <span class="italic">Vino eucharistico aqua necessario admiscenda</span>. Wagstaffe's rejoinder of the same title (1719) led to Drake's 1721 response, <span class="italic">Ad Thomam Wagstaffe</span>, to which Wagstaffe responded in 1725 with his <span class="italic">Responsionis ad concionem vindiciae</span>.<br>
<br>Despite his insistence on the essential nature of the usages, Wagstaffe reluctantly agreed to the reunion of the two parties engineered by Thomas Brett and George Smith in 1732. Nevertheless, he criticized the concordat for abandoning the theological foundations of the usages, and believed that the abandonment of their communion office would lead to greater decline in the nonjuror movement's congregations, his included. Yet he did not feel comfortable with the party of Archibald Campbell and Thomas Deacon that continued to hold the essentialist position. Before leaving Dunstan's Court he warned his congregation not to secede to Campbell, whom he charged with holding heretical doctrines concerning hell.<br>
<br>The discomfort with the concordat and the tension with Brett over his remarks concerning Campbell led Wagstaffe to withdraw from active involvement in the movement. His congregation at Dunstan's Court disappeared and he refused to take over the Scroop's Court congregation. In the spring of 1734 Wagstaffe left England for the continent. He joined the Stuart court in Rome, where he served as the Anglican chaplain to James III (James Stuart) and then to his son, Charles Edward. He lived in Rome very simply and spent his time in scholarly pursuits, producing a manuscript detailing the Greek manuscripts of St Paul's epistles held in the Vatican and Cardinal Barberini libraries, which was given to Sion College.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe died on 3 December 1770 in Rome, where he was buried, respected by the Stuart court and the people of Rome who knew him. At his death he was described as a &#145;fine, wel-bred old gentleman&#146;, who was a pious and sincere Christian, whom the people of Rome &#145;were wont to say that had he not been a Heretic, he ought to have been canonized&#146;  (Overton, 338).<br>
