<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paget,  William</span>, sixth Baron Paget  (1609&#150;1678), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 September 1609, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21122/', "William Paget, fifth Baron Paget (1572&#150;1629)")</script>, of Beaudesert, Staffordshire, and his wife, Lettice (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter and coheir of Henry Knollys of Kingsbury, Warwickshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70274/', "Anne Waller, Lady Waller")</script>, was his sister. After a &#145;strict&#146;  (E. E. Harcourt, ed., <span class="italic">The Harcourt Papers</span>, 14 vols., 1880&#150;1905, 1.171) religious upbringing in West Drayton, Middlesex, Paget attended Christ Church, Oxford, from where he matriculated on 18 December 1627.<br>
<br>Made a knight of the Bath at Charles I's coronation, Paget inherited the title of Baron Paget on his father's death. However, he was an unsuccessful courtier, being confined to purely ceremonial roles such as waiting on ambassadors and appearing in court masques. Even Paget's marriage in 1632 to Lady Frances Rich (<i>d</i>. 1672), the eldest daughter of the royal favourite, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23484/', "Henry Rich, first earl of Holland (bap. 1590, d. 1649)")</script>, failed to secure him a major court office, although thanks to his father-in-law's influence he was appointed keeper of New Lodge Walk in Windsor Forest on 9 February 1642.<br>
<br>By the end of the personal rule Paget had become increasingly alienated with royal policies, as shown by his refusal to serve in the first bishops' war in March 1639 and by his vote against granting the king supplies to renew hostilities with the Scots in the Short Parliament of 1640. His opposition to Charles I had become even more overt by August 1640 when he supported the twelve peers' petition urging the king to summon another parliament. On 28 September 1640 Paget was one of the sixteen peers appointed by the king to negotiate an Anglo-Scottish treaty following his disastrous defeat in the second bishops' war. During the first session of the Long Parliament &#145;honest Paget&#146; as he was later termed by the earl of Manchester  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644&#150;5</i>, 160), played a key role in the impeachment of Strafford and Laud, the passage of major constitutional measures like the abolition of Star Chamber, and, above all, the promotion of religious reforms. His &#145;violence&#146;  (J. Rochester, &#145;Diary of a bishop&#146;, BL, Harley MS 6424, fol. 39) against the bishops and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> was what one might have expected of a man who was an unalloyed presbyterian and who showed a keen &#145;desire&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 7, 1644&#150;5, 19) to take the national covenant in October 1644.<br>
<br>Paget's anti-court stance continued in the second session of the Long Parliament and is best epitomized by his support for the militia ordinance, which he implemented as lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire in mid-May 1642. However, he now experienced a crisis of conscience and defected to the king, joining him at York on 14 June. There he signed a declaration to defend Charles's &#145;just rights and prerogatives&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;3</i>, 340, 342) and undertook to raise a 1200-strong infantry regiment. After seeing his regiment badly mauled at the battle of Edgehill in late October 1642, Paget joined the king in Oxford, residing at Wadham College. In January 1644 he served in the Oxford parliament and subscribed to the letter addressed to the earl of Essex calling for peace negotiations. By the following autumn his growing disillusionment with the royalist cause prompted his return to the parliamentarian fold. He surrendered at Plymouth in late September 1644 and, following a brief period of imprisonment, was fined &pound;1500, of which he paid only a third. For all his efforts, Paget never secured readmission to the House of Lords, and this perhaps explains why he lent covert support to his father-in-law's pro-royalist uprising in June 1648.<br>
<br>Paget was clearly horrified by Charles I's execution and viewed the Rump as a &#145;usurped authority&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/20/21); however, in Lord Lisle's telling phrase, he learned to be &#145;a good Commonswealthman&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.482), which was just as well, since in October 1651 his estates again fell forfeit after the committee for compounding was informed of his former complicity in the earl of Holland's rebellion. The case dragged on until March 1653 when Paget was finally discharged by the <span class="roman">Act of Pardon</span>. During the rule of the major-generals, however, Paget was threatened with decimation, but after an appeal to the protector he secured his exemption from the hated tax as well as obtaining a licence to reside within the cavalier exclusion zone around London.<br>
<br>The meeting of the Convention Parliament marked Paget's return to public life, although he had to be commanded &#145;to give [his] attendance&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 11, 1660&#150;66, 27) by formal letter on 14 May 1660. He gave his full support to Charles II's restoration, but for the next decade concentrated on restoring his family's financial fortunes which were now in an &#145;ill-condition&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29910, fol. 20). With debts amounting to over &pound;3000, and living on an income of little more than &pound;23, Paget was forced to petition the king for relief, but to no avail. This rebuff may partly account for Paget's opposition to the crown in the later stages of the Cavalier Parliament. In April 1675 he was one of the &#145;Country&#146;  (Swatland, 270, appx 1, col. 11) peers who expressed their dissent at government moves to tamper with the freedom of debate and the voting rights of members of the upper chamber.<br>
<br>In the last eight years of his life Paget's health began to deteriorate: in November 1670 he was excused attendance in the Lords for being &#145;sick&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 13, 1675&#150;81, 16), and again in November 1675 his absence was condoned because he was &#145;not well&#146;  (ibid., 364). He died, intestate, at his house in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, on 19 October 1678 and was buried in the family mausoleum at West Drayton, Middlesex, on 7 November and succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21124/', "William Paget")</script>. He was said by a post-Restoration commentator to have been of &#145;Noe parts &hellip; except a good stomack&#146;  (Kidson, 40); and significantly in the funeral sermon preached by his chaplain, John Heynes, there is a deafening silence about his personal attributes.<br>
