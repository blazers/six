<span class="headword">Proctor,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1578&#150;1584), <span class="occ">poet</span>, has usually been identified as the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22837/', "John Proctor")</script>, first master of Tonbridge School. But all that can be proved definitely about him is that he became apprenticed to John Allde, the printer, and was made a freeman of the Stationers' Company on 17 August 1584.<br>
<br>The most important publication with which Proctor was involved is <span class="italic">A gorgious gallery of gallant inventions &hellip; first framed and fashioned in sundry forms by divers worthy workemen of late dayes, and now joyned together and builded up by T.P.</span>, a quarto printed by Richard Jones in 1578. Jones's entries in the Stationers' register show that this project had a complicated gestation, since &#145;R. Williams&#146; was seemingly named as the compiler in an entry of 5 June 1577, and the book's title was changed from &#145;A Handful of Hidden Secrets&#146; to &#145;Delicate Dainties to Sweeten a Lover's Lips Withal&#146;, before taking on its final form. As it is, the anthology begins with an address and a poem by Owen Roydon, an experienced compiler of miscellanies, and Hyder E. Rollins has plausibly argued that Proctor was called in to take over the project after Owen Roydon's death during the period when the book was being developed. The miscellany continues with unsigned poems from several hands, including Thomas Churchyard and Jasper Heywood, until page 100. The heading &#145;Proctor's Precepts&#146; introduces another fifty-two pages of poems, of which ten are signed &#145;T. P.&#146; As a poetical miscellany, it takes its place in the line that starts with Richard Tottell's in 1557: to modern readers, its most interesting individual item is &#145;The History of Pyramus and Thisbie Truly Translated&#146;, a translation which may possibly have given Shakespeare material for <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>.<br>
<br>Anthony Munday, who like Proctor was an apprentice of John Allde, wrote commendatory verses for <span class="italic">A Gorgious Gallery</span>, and in the following year, 1579, Proctor repaid the compliment in contributing commendatory verses to Munday's <span class="italic">The Mirror of Mutability</span>. In the same year, both writers also provided commendatory verses for <span class="italic">Newes from the North</span>, by &#145;T. F.&#146;<br>
<br>Also probably by Proctor is a poem entitled <span class="italic">The Triumph of Trueth, Manifesting the Advancement of Virtue and the Overthrow of Vice</span>, published by T. P. This publication is not dated, and survives only in one incomplete fragment now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. A &#145;T. P.&#146; also wrote a prose tract <span class="italic">Of the Knowledge and Conduct of Warres, Two Bookes, Latelie Written and Sett Foorthe</span>, licensed to Tottell in 1578. The tract is a collection of general and rather abstract advice on military matters, and once again it seems possible that its author was Proctor.<br>
<br>Strangely, apart from the records above, there is no trace of Proctor having been involved in the printing of books. His career after 1584 remains obscure. It is possible, but unlikely, that he was the Thomas Proctor who wrote three Jacobean pamphlets, <span class="italic">A Profitable Worke to the Whole Kingdome</span> (1610) and <span class="italic">The Right of Kings</span> and <span class="italic">The Righteous Man's Way</span> (both 1621).<br>
