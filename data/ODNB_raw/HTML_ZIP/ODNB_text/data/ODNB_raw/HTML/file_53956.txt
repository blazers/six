<span class="headword">Brown,  John Alexander  Harvie-, of Dunipace</span>  (1844&#150;1916), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 27 August 1844 in Edinburgh, the only son of John Harvie (<i>d</i>. 1880), landowner, and Elizabeth Spottiswoode, the daughter and heir of Thomas Spottiswoode of Dunipace, near Stirling. His father assumed the additional surname of Brown under the terms of the will of Alexander Brown of Quarter, Stirlingshire. Harvie-Brown was educated at Merchiston School and subsequently at Edinburgh and Cambridge universities (although he appears not to have graduated from either). At Cambridge he formed a friendship with Professor Alfred Newton, the ornithologist, a friendship that encouraged Harvie-Brown's interest in natural history. A man of independent means, Harvie-Brown was able to devote his life to the traditional highland laird pursuits with rod and gun and to ornithology.<br>
<br>In the 1880s there was considerable interest in bird migration and Harvie-Brown initiated a scheme, developed by the British Association, to use records of migrating birds collected by lighthouse keepers. Much of Harvie-Brown's life was spent in producing a series of volumes on the vertebrate fauna of Scotland, his most important works. The first volume, co-authored with J. E. Buckley, was published in 1887, the <span class="italic">Vertebrate Fauna of Sutherland, Caithness, and West Cromarty</span>; it was followed, over the next twenty-five years, by volumes on the Outer Hebrides, the Orkneys, Argyll and the Inner Hebrides, the Moray basin, the Shetlands, the north-west Highlands and Skye, the Tay basin and Strathmore, and the Tweed area. The books describe the distribution and abundance of the vertebrate fauna of each area, and have information on geology, topography, and climate.<br>
<br>Harvie-Brown travelled widely in Scotland and in 1887 he built his own yacht, <i>Shiantelle</i>, to visit the islands and sea lochs of the west coast. He also travelled widely in Europe, especially in northern Scandinavia and Russia, and in 1905 he published a two-volume account of his experiences in <span class="italic">Travels of a Naturalist in Northern Europe</span>. He was a prolific writer and was the founder, owner, and joint editor for twenty-five years of <span class="italic">The Annals of Scottish Natural History</span>, later to become the <span class="italic">Scottish Naturalist</span>. He was a fellow of the Zoological Society and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and an honorary life member of the American Ornithologists' Union. In 1912 he was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Harvie-Brown was a short, thickset, powerfully built man. As the laird of Dunipace estate, he was regarded with affection by his tenants, employees, and neighbours. He became seriously ill with influenza in 1899 and his health never fully recovered. He also suffered from asthma, and from a constant battle with his weight which rose to 25 stones. For the last few years of his life he was more or less confined to a ground floor study bedroom in his house, from where he kept up a continuous flow of correspondence. He died at his home, Dunipace House, Larbert, after a short final illness, on 26 July 1916 and was buried in the family graveyard at Dunipace, in front of the house. He never married.<br>
