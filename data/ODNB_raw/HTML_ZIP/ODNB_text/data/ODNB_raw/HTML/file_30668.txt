<span class="headword">Bedson, Sir  Samuel Phillips</span>  (1886&#150;1969), <span class="occ">bacteriologist</span>, was born on 1 December 1886 at Newcastle upon Tyne, the second son of Peter Phillips Bedson, professor of chemistry in the Durham College of Science, and his wife, Annie, daughter of Samuel Hodgkinson, cotton spinner, of Marple, Cheshire. He was educated at Abbotsholme School, Derbyshire. Before he left school he had decided on a medical career, but he was persuaded by his father to take a degree in science first. He graduated BSc with distinction in 1907. From 1907 to 1912 he studied medicine at Durham University and graduated with honours in 1912. Influenced by the teaching of H. J. Hutchens, he decided to specialize in bacteriology and went to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where he studied under brilliant French microbiologists, among them P. P. E. Roux, A. Borrel, C. L. A. Laveran, A. Besredka, and I. Mechnikov. The research work which he carried out in M. Weinberg's laboratory at this time on the toxic substances obtained from parasitic worms was embodied in a thesis which gained him the MD (1914) and gold medal of Durham University.<br>
<br>In 1913 Bedson returned to England where he worked as British medical scholar at the Lister Institute in London under John Ledingham. Their experimental work on blood platelets and purpura was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914. Refused a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps, which had no vacancies for doctors trained in research, Bedson joined the Northumberland Fusiliers as a combatant officer and went with the 8th battalion to Gallipoli in 1915. In August of that year he suffered a severe chest wound and was evacuated to England. He was later sent to France, where in 1916 he was transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps. From then until his demobilization in 1919 he served as a pathologist in various laboratories in France and became adviser in pathology to the Fifth Army (France). For two years after the war he was lecturer in bacteriology at the medical school in Durham. He returned in 1921 to the Lister Institute, where he continued his work on the origin and disposal of blood platelets and their role in the production of purpura. The conclusions he reached on the basis of his experimental studies were confirmed by the subsequent work of others.<br>
<br>In 1924 Bedson was seconded to work on foot-and-mouth disease at the Lister Institute under the supervision of Joseph Arkwright, and thus began his research on virus disease, then largely an unexplored field. The work by Bedson and his colleagues both on the causal virus of foot-and-mouth disease and on immunity to it provided a sound basis for subsequent advances in the knowledge of virus diseases.<br>
<br>In 1926 Bedson married Dorothea Annie Hoffert, a research assistant at the Lister Institute, and elder daughter of Henry Herman Hoffert, senior inspector of schools. There were three sons, the second of whom, Henry Samuel Bedson, became reader in virology at Birmingham University. In the same year as his marriage Bedson was appointed to a Freedom research fellowship at the London Hospital, where his eight years as fellow were to prove the most productive of his scientific career. He published several important papers on the nature of viruses, using the viruses of vaccinia and herpes simplex in his experiments. In 1929 there occurred the pandemic of human psittacosis infection. Bedson discovered and described the causal agent of the disease and much of his subsequent work was devoted to the study of this and related micro-organisms. This group of infective agents became commonly referred to as the bedsoniae. While Bedson was a pioneer investigator in virology, his international reputation was associated mainly with his work on the micro-organisms of the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group, which was summarized in his Harben lectures (1959). He was elected FRS in 1935.<br>
<br>In 1934 Bedson succeeded William Bulloch as professor of bacteriology at the London Hospital medical college. Although his teaching and administrative duties lessened the time he could spend in the laboratory he enjoyed contact with the students. He was a good lecturer and took a keen interest in the welfare and subsequent careers of his pupils. From 1939 to 1944 he was pathologist to metropolitan region 5 of the Emergency Medical Service, with his headquarters at Billericay in Essex. He returned to the London Hospital in 1944 and in 1946 succeeded Philip Panton as director of the division of pathology, thus adding to his responsibilities in the medical college. In 1949 he followed Panton as consultant adviser in pathology to the Ministry of Health, an office which he held until 1960. When he retired from the chair at the London Hospital in 1952 he took charge of the British Empire Campaign virus unit in the Middlesex Hospital, where he continued his research for the next ten years.<br>
<br>Bedson was a member of the governing body of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Research Institute at Pirbright (1950&#150;55), the council of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (1942&#150;55), the army pathological advisory committee (1937&#150;62), the governing body of the Lister Institute (1944&#150;54), the Public Health Laboratory Service Board (1950&#150;57), the Medical Research Council (1941&#150;5), and the council of the Royal Society (1937&#150;8 and 1941&#150;2). He was awarded the Conway Evans prize in 1952. The honorary degree of DSc was conferred on him by the Queen's University of Belfast in 1937 and by the University of Durham in 1946. He was elected FRCP in 1945 and knighted in 1956.<br>
<br>Bedson was slim and of less than average height. He almost invariably wore a bow-tie. He was neat and orderly in all he did. He was a very skilful technician and preferred to do all his own experiments which were devised with care and precision. His opinions were tenaciously held and would be abandoned only if convincing evidence were forthcoming. He was regarded with great affection and respect by his colleagues and pupils, and in private life he was a delightful companion and host. His favourite hobby was trout-fishing. Bedson died in Hove, Sussex, on 11 May 1969, and his widow died later in the same year.<br>
