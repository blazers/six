<span class="headword">Yonge,  James</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1405&#150;1434), <span class="occ">translator</span>, belonged to an English family settled in Dublin. According to deeds belonging to the parish of St John, Dublin, his family was long associated with that parish. On 16 March 1405 James Yonge, &#145;clerk, notary public&#146;, certified concerning a case of unlawful imprisonment, and again on 28 November 1411, concerning dower rights to a property. On 9 August 1417 he was appointed attorney in a property transaction. From January to October 1423 he was in prison in Trim Castle, Meath. Before the end of October he was moved to Dublin Castle, and was pardoned on 10 May 1425. In the will of John Lytill (probate granted 5 November 1434) he was left 20<i>s</i>. apparently for acting as executor. Other members of his family also appear in the parish deeds. John Yonge, possibly a brother, is cited as &#145;clerk, notary public&#146; on 12 November 1411, and William Yonge, &#145;citizen and butcher&#146;, on 8 August 1446.<br>
<br>Yonge is referred to as &#145;James Young, or Junius, a Notar-Publick of the City of Dublin&#146; by Sir James Ware, who (in the English version of Ware's <span class="italic">De scriptoribus Hiberniae</span> issued by Walter Harris in 1744) credits him with writing &#145;<span class="italic">Monita Politica de bono Regimine</span>, to James, Earl of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (An. 1407) and a <span class="italic">History of the Pilgrimage of Laurence Rathold, a knight, and Baron of Hungary, to St. Patrick's Purgatory</span>, An. 1411&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works</span>, 1.88). Yonge seems to have been working for Ormond, who was deputy lieutenant of Ireland, in some official capacity, and <span class="italic">Monita politica</span> is to be identified with the English translation, with extensive alterations and additions, which he made in 1422 at the earl's request, of the French version of the <span class="italic">Secreta secretorum</span> (a text erroneously attributed to Aristotle). The translation, which is free, is divided into seventy-two chapters, and includes additional material (mainly comprising chapters 32 and 33) on Irish history, inserted by Yonge, which discloses and affirms his prejudice in favour of the legitimacy of English rule in Ireland. Under the title <span class="italic">The Governaunce of Prynces, or, Pryvete of Pryveteis</span>, Yonge's translation was published in 1898 by Robert Steele from Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. B.490, one of three extant manuscripts, the other two being LPL, MS 633, and LPL, Carew MS 633. The last of these contains the note: &#145;This book was written in the time of King Henry V, by John Yonge, servant to James Butler, Earl of Ormond, and dedicated to his said Lord and Master&#146;. In a prefatory note to his edition, Steele rightly describes Yonge's translation as &#145;perhaps the only lengthy work written in the English of the Pale early in the fifteenth century&#146;. Yonge is also credited with an abridged translation of the <span class="italic">Expugnatio Hibernica</span> of Gerald of Wales which precedes <span class="italic">The Governaunce of Prynces</span> in the Rawlinson manuscript.<br>
<br>In 1411 Yonge was commissioned to write an account, in Latin, of the experiences of Laurentius Ratholdus of Paazth&oacute; in Hungary, who made the pilgrimage to the cave in Station Island on Lough Derg, Donegal, in 1411; this was edited by Delehaye in 1908, from BL, Royal MS 10 B.ix, which constitutes a copy of Yonge's original narrative, completed in 1461 by a monk named Henry Cranebrook. In this work Yonge refers to himself as &#145;I James Yonge, imperial notary of the citizens, and least of the scriveners, of the city of Dublin&#146; (&#145;Igitur ego Jacobus Yonge notarius imperialis civium et scriptorum minimus civitatis Dublinensis&#146;; &#145;P&egrave;lerinage&#146;, 58&#150;9; J. F. Niermeyer defines <i>notarius imperialis</i> as a &#145;clerk in the royal chancery&#146;). It is possible that Ratholdus's pilgrimage was a pretext for a secret diplomatic mission. Yonge's account is based on conversations which he had had with Ratholdus, and includes material of his own, containing a description of the island, as well as documents relating to the pilgrimage issued by King Sigismund of Hungary, Nicholas Fleming, archbishop of Armagh, and Matthew, prior of St Patrick's Purgatory.<br>
