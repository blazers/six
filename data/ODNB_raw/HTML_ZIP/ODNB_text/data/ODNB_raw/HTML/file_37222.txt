<span class="headword">Bridge,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1834), <span class="occ">jeweller</span>, was born in Piddletrenthide, Dorset, on 21 January 1755, the eldest son of Thomas Bridge (<i>d</i>. 1792) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1779). Following in the footsteps of his future partner, Philip Rundell, he was apprenticed in 1769 to the jeweller William Rogers of Bath. His apprenticeship over, Bridge migrated to London about 1776, where he was employed as a shopman by Pickett and Rundell, goldsmiths and jewellers, at the Golden Salmon, Ludgate Hill. William Pickett, the senior partner, retired from business in February 1786, and Philip Rundell, by then in sole control, invited Bridge in December 1787 to join him in a partnership; thereafter the firm continued as Rundell and Bridge. The two partners, so different in character that they were respectively known by their employees as &#145;Oil&#146; (Bridge) and &#145;Vinegar&#146;, worked tirelessly to place the business at the forefront of their trade. By 1805, when the firm had become Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell, Joseph Nightingale wrote that it exceeded &#145;all others in the British Empire, if not in the whole world, for the value of its contents&#146;.<br>
<br>Bridge was described as &#145;mild and affable in his deportment, possessing great equality of temper, and a very engaging suavity of manners&#146;. It is said that in 1789 he was introduced to George III by a wealthy cousin, also called John Bridge, who shared the monarch's interest in farming. The jeweller so pleased the king and other members of the royal family that Rundell and Bridge received many fresh orders. Their growing success was then assured.<br>
<br>Bridge remained a partner in the firm until his death. He never married. Towards the end of his life he bought Wood House with its estate at Wood Lane, Shepherd's Bush, where he lived with two cousins, Amelia and Maria Bridge. He died on 9 April 1834 at the Manor House, Piddletrenthide, and was buried in the family vault in the local churchyard. In the aisle of the church a carved stone tablet with a portrait profile of John Bridge in marble was erected &#145;by his surviving relatives in testimony of their grateful and affectionate remembrance&#146;.<br>
