<span class="headword">Barber,  Anthony Perrinott Lysberg</span>, Baron Barber  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Bornholm, Northfield, Kingston upon Hull, on 4 July 1920, the youngest of three sons of John Barber (<i>d</i>. 1958), businessman, and his wife, Ellen Katty (Mussee) Lysberg (<i>d</i>. 1945). His father was managing director of a confectionery firm in Doncaster and at one time a personal assistant to Lord Leverhulme. His mother was Danish. His brother Noel (1909&#150;1988) became a respected journalist and author and his brother Kenneth became a banker.<br>
<br>Barber was educated at Retford grammar school in Nottinghamshire. Plans for him to be articled as a solicitor were aborted by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He joined the Doncaster branch of the territorials, was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, and went to France in 1940. He was in the withdrawal from Dunkirk in the same year and on his return to Britain was transferred to the RAF as a pilot in the photographic reconnaissance unit. On a mission in 1942 he ran out of fuel and bailed out over France. He was captured and remained a prisoner for the rest of the war. He made a number of escape attempts (one in which he was involved inspired the film <span class="italic">The Wooden Horse</span>) and once managed to reach Denmark&#151;thanks to his Danish mother he could speak the language&#151;but was recaptured. He then decided to concentrate on studying by correspondence for a law degree from London University. He relied on materials supplied by the International Red Cross and gained a first-class degree. He was already showing the qualities of application, intellect, and ambition that marked his later career. Following the war he spent two years in the war-shortened philosophy, politics, and economics course at Oriel College, Oxford, emerging with a second-class degree. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1948, and practised as a barrister specializing in taxation. He was also set on a political career and, as the only applicant for the Conservative nomination, was selected to fight the safe Labour seat of Doncaster in the general election of 1950. Helped by redistribution, he substantially reduced the majority. In the general election of 1951 he was narrowly elected. On 5 September the previous year he had married Jean Patricia Asquith (<i>d</i>. 1983), the thirty-year-old daughter of Milton Asquith, businessman, of the Manor House, Wentbridge, Yorkshire. She had also fought the election of 1950 as a Conservative candidate. They had two daughters, Louise (<i>b</i>. 1951) and Josephine (<i>b</i>. 1953).<br>
<br>In parliament Barber had a three-year stint as a parliamentary private secretary and between 1955 and 1958 a three-year spell as a junior whip. Significantly for his later career the chief whip at the time was Edward Heath, later Conservative leader and prime minister. In 1958 Barber became parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister, Harold Macmillan. In October 1959 he was promoted to the Treasury, serving first as economic secretary and from July 1962 as financial secretary. In October 1963 Sir Alec Douglas-Home became prime minister and he appointed Barber to the cabinet as minister of health, in succession to Enoch Powell, who had refused to serve. Barber was also sworn of the privy council and held the health post for twelve months. In the general election of October 1964 he lost Doncaster but in February 1965 was returned in a by-election for Altrincham and Sale. He held that seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in the general election of 1974. During the period of opposition he built up a successful business career. He was a non-executive director of Chartered Bank (later merged with Standard, and to figure in his later career), a director of British Roads, and chairman of his father-in-law's company, Redfearn National Glass. In 1965, following Douglas-Home's resignation as leader of the Conservative Party, he managed Edward Heath's successful campaign for the post. His reward came in 1967 when Heath appointed him party chairman. He diligently toured the local associations, explaining party policy and listening to complaints, which he passed on to Heath and the shadow cabinet. Among the grass roots he loyally backed Heath against the supporters of Enoch Powell, whom Heath had sacked from the shadow cabinet following his notorious &#145;rivers of blood&#146; speech.<br>
<br>Barber held his nerve during the general election of June 1970, which produced a surprise victory for the Conservatives. The press and many of Heath's colleagues, prompted by the opinion polls, expected a comfortable majority for the Labour government. British entry to the European Economic Community was central to Heath's plans for reviving the British economy and strengthening Britain's place in the world. He appointed Barber chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster with special responsibility for negotiating Britain's entry to Europe. But a month later the chancellor of the exchequer, Iain Macleod, died suddenly. Heath needed a replacement. Recalled from Brussels to meet Heath in number 10, Barber said to a friend in a lift going up to see the prime minister: &#145;I hope he's not going to ask me to be Chancellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 19 Dec 2005). Barber had already decided that he would return to a business or City career in the next two to three years. Nevertheless Heath persuaded him to take the post, and on 25 July he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer. During his tenure of 11 Downing Street he was caught between a prime minister set on a course of economic expansion and a more cautious Treasury, and his reputation has suffered because of the onset of a savage inflation, some of it caused by his policies.<br>
<br>It might have been expected that with his specialist legal background in taxation and his previous Treasury experience Barber would be a successful chancellor. In fact the verdict of most commentators places him near the bottom of the list of effective chancellors. Most of the tax reforms he inherited from Macleod. In his October 1970 statement Barber abolished purchase tax and selective employment tax, and introduced value added tax (VAT). He also announced a reduction in the basic rate of income tax of 6<i>d</i>. in the pound as well as cutting spending, notably in housing subsidies and welfare, imposing charges for entry to museums and art galleries, and ending free milk for primary school children. In his 1971 budget statement Barber had referred to the &#145;baffling combination of evils&#146;, rising unemployment and rising inflation. Old Keynesian methods of trading off unemployment and price increases no longer worked. His initial priority was to combat inflation. But in 1972 these policies were put into reverse, and the new imperative was to stem the rise in unemployment. In January the unemployment figure had passed the 1 million mark. The government, however, continued to face numerous inflationary pressures. There was a steep rise in commodity prices and in 1973 Arab oil prices were quadrupled, following the Arab&#150;Israeli War, and militant trade unions were pressing for large wage increases.<br>
<br>Edward Heath increasingly relied for economic advice on Sir William Armstrong, head of the civil service. The two men shaped the expansionist budget of 1972, which combined tax cuts, incentives for investment, and increased public spending. The government set a target of 5 per cent growth in the hope that a dynamic British economy would be able to take advantage of its access to a larger European market. Heath was determined to end the stop-go British economy and, faced with a declining currency, floated the pound in June 1972. But Barber added to inflationary pressures by presiding over a large increase in the money supply in 1972 and 1973, after his removal in November 1971, on the recommendation of the Bank of England, of quantitative controls on bank advances. Heath resisted the obvious alternative&#151;raising interest rates&#151;because he wanted business to invest. The economy grew rapidly but at an unsustainable pace and the balance of payments went into heavy deficit. Barber later conceded that the budget of 1972 had proved inflationary and expressed regret. The Treasury proved unable to withstand the political influence of the prime minister and spending ministers. The government then reversed its previous disavowal of prices and incomes policies in autumn 1972, introducing the statutory prices and incomes policy to head off rising inflation. By December 1973 the government was forced to reverse economic policy again, imposing cuts in public spending, increases on surtax, and controls on the money supply. The incomes policy meanwhile led to conflict with the trade unions, notably the miners at the end of 1973, a general election, in February 1974, and the downfall of the government.<br>
<br>Barber was made a life peer in Edward Heath's dissolution honours list and entered the House of Lords as Baron Barber, of Wentbridge, Yorkshire. He had left politics aged only fifty-four. Politics may have had little to offer him, however. He lacked a base in the parliamentary party and his reputation had plummeted; &#145;the Barber boom&#146; was an enduring and unfortunate appellation. His legacy when the government fell in February 1974 was rapidly rising inflation and a record balance of payments deficit. He became chairman of Standard Chartered Bank (the merger had been completed in 1969), and remained in post until 1987. It was an overseas bank and Barber spent a lot of time travelling, particularly in Africa and Asia. (At one time the young John Major was one of his advisers.) He was also a director of BP. In 1982 he was a member of the Franks inquiry into the conduct of the war with Argentina over the Falklands. Interested in conservation, he was chairman of the council of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. He was one of the Commonwealth eminent persons group who visited South Africa in 1986 to explore ways in which the tensions in the country might be eased. He was in a minority of one in opposing tougher sanctions to force the South African regime to abandon apartheid. Critics noted that Standard Chartered did much business in South Africa. In fact Barber detested apartheid, but he feared that sanctions would have an impact largely on the black population. In 1991 he was chairman of the RAF Benevolent Association's appeal launched for the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Britain, which raised over &pound;25 million. He had a low profile in the House of Lords and avoided public comment on Conservative Party politics. In private, however, he was critical of what he regarded as the divisive conduct first of Edward Heath, after he had lost the party leadership to Margaret Thatcher in 1975, and then of Thatcher after she lost the leadership in 1990. In 1996 he published privately a discreet and little noted memoir, <span class="italic">Taking the Tide</span>.<br>
<br>Anthony Barber was a professional politician, largely self-made, and one of the so-called &#145;Heathmen&#146; who had been to grammar schools or minor public schools. Sir Alec Douglas-Home's last cabinet contained eleven old Etonians, Heath's only three. In private he was modest, witty, and charming, as well as being businesslike. In public some interpreted his directness as abruptness, and he was a pugnacious debater. Proud of his Yorkshire background, he retained a home there until late in life. He was relatively short, wiry, prematurely bald, and a desperate smoker. Smoking was forbidden in Heath's cabinet meetings and Barber regularly withdrew from cabinet to enjoy a cigarette. Until he was enlightened the prime minister thought that his chancellor's sudden withdrawals were designed to check for a change in the bank rate or some other dramatic economic news.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, on 8 September 1989 Barber married Rosemary Ann (<i>d</i>. 2003), the 61-year-old daughter of Canon Fearnley Algernon Cyril Youens, and the former wife of John Surgenor. Following her death he decided to move to Suffolk to be near his daughter Josephine. He suffered from Parkinson's disease and died at Ipswich Hospital of bronchopneumonia, on 16 December 2005. He was survived by his two daughters. A memorial service was held on 27 April 2006 at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
