<span class="headword">Laing,  Malcolm</span>  (1762&#150;1818), <span class="occ">historian and advocate</span>, was the eldest son of Robert Laing (<i>d</i>. 1805), a merchant and provost of Kirkwall in 1788&#150;92, who came of an old Orkney family; his brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15891/', "Samuel Laing (1780&#150;1868)")</script>. Laing was born at the paternal estate of Strynzie (or Strenzie), on the island of Stronsay. He was educated at Kirkwall grammar school and Edinburgh University, and was called to the Scottish bar on 9 July 1785, but his practice remained small. His speeches in the court were neither eloquent nor pleasing, though in parliament he was considered an able speaker. Lord Cockburn highly praised his speech in 1794 defending Joseph Gerrald (1763&#150;1796), a delegate from the London Corresponding Society, charged with sedition.<br>
<br>Turning from legal work, Laing devoted much of his time to historical studies. On the death of the historian Robert Henry, at the request of Henry's executors, he completed <span class="italic">The History of Great Britain</span>, adding chapters 5 and 7 and the appendix to volume 6 (1793). In 1800 Laing published <span class="italic">The history of Scotland, from the union of the crowns on the accession of King James VI to the throne of England, to the union of the kingdoms in the reign of Queen Anne, with two dissertations, historical and critical, on the Gowrie conspiracy, and on the supposed authenticity of Ossian's poems</span>. Though written in a somewhat awkward and overelaborate style, his <span class="italic">History</span> &#145;was full of useful research and displayed a breadth of knowledge that Robertson's <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> might not have commanded&#146;  (Price). The dissertation on the <span class="italic">Poems of Ossian</span> is a severely negative and insensitive criticism of James Macpherson's supposed Gaelic translations. Laing could not set aside the charges of forgery against Macpherson and remained contemptuous of the poet's genius. In 1804 Laing published a second and corrected edition of his <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> in four volumes, with a preliminary &#145;Dissertation on the participation of Mary, Queen of Scots, in the murder of Darnley&#146;. Here he attempted to establish the authenticity of the casket letters, and his dissertation was an able statement of the case against the queen. In the same year he edited <span class="italic">The Historie and Life of King James VI</span>, and in May and June 1805 published a heavily annotated edition of <span class="italic">The poems of Ossian, containing the poetical works of James Macpherson in prose and verse, with notes and illustrations</span>.<br>
<br>Laing was a strong-minded liberal in politics, a Scottish Foxite, who along with seven other Edinburgh whig lawyers, known as the Independent Friends, opposed the machine-politician Henry Dundas and his tory coalition. He joined the Whig Club in 1796 and helped C. J. Fox to write his own historical work. After a number of broken pledges to bring Laing into parliament, his Scots and English colleagues finally arranged his appointment. In the general election of 1807 Laing was named to the uncontested seat of Orkney and Shetland and held the office until 1812.<br>
<br>Laing married Margaret Carnegie, daughter of Thomas Carnegie of Craigo, Forfarshire, on 10 September 1805; the couple had no children. Soon after, in 1808, he left London and Edinburgh and returned to Orkney. Growing physical ailments in his last years forced his retirement from an active career. Sir Walter Scott described a visit paid to him at Kirkwall in August 1814. &#145;Our old acquaintance,&#146; he wrote, &#145;though an invalid, received us kindly; he looks very poorly, and cannot walk without assistance, but seems to retain all the quick, earnest, and vivacious intelligence of his character and manner&#146;  (J. G. Lockhart, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 5 vols., 1914, 2.380). Laing died on 6 November 1818 at Kirkwall. There is a tablet to his memory on the wall of the north nave of Kirkwall Cathedral. &#145;Depth, truth, and independence as a historian were&#146;, Lord Cockburn commented, &#145;the least of his merits, for he was a firm, warm-hearted, honest man, whose instructive and agreeable companionship was only made the more interesting by a hard, peremptory Celtic manner and accent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 202&#150;3).<br>
