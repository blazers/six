<span class="headword">Atkinson,  James</span>  (1780&#150;1852), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in the county of Durham on 9 March 1780. After studying medicine at Edinburgh and London, he accepted the post of medical officer on board an East Indiaman. In 1805 he was appointed an assistant surgeon in the Bengal service, and placed in medical charge of the station of Bakarganj, near Dacca. In his leisure time he devoted himself with considerable success to the study of Persian and other oriental languages. Having attracted the attention of Lord Minto, the governor-general, Atkinson was invited to Calcutta in 1813, and given the appointment of assistant assay master at the mint, which he retained until 1828. In 1818 he also filled the deputy chair of Persian in Fort William College. He visited England in 1826&#150;7. In addition to his appointment at the mint, he held the post of superintendent of the <span class="italic">Government Gazette</span> from 1817 to 1828. When the official connection of the government with that journal was discontinued in 1823, the proprietors, in view of his previous success, invited Atkinson to take sole charge of both the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> and the <span class="italic">Press</span>. Under his editorship the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> published valuable statistical and topographical information on little known parts of India. After a second visit to England in 1828&#150;33, Atkinson returned to his original profession, as surgeon to the 55th regiment of native infantry. In 1838 he was appointed chief surgeon to the army of the Indus, and accompanied it on its march to Kabul, but he was relieved in the ordinary course of routine shortly after the surrender of Dost Mohammad. He returned to Bengal in 1841, and thus escaped the fate which awaited the army of occupation. He was appointed a member of the medical board in 1845, retired in 1847 after forty-two years of service, and died of apoplexy at 18 Dorset Square, London, on 7 August 1852.<br>
<br>Atkinson's Persian translations in both prose and verse are his chief title to fame, and of these his selections from the <span class="italic">Sh&acirc;h N&acirc;meh</span> of Firdausi are the most notable. They were the first attempt to make the great Persian <span class="italic">Epic of Kings</span> familiar to English readers. He first published the episode of <span class="italic">Sohr&#257;b</span>, in Persian with a free English translation, in 1814. In 1832 the <span class="italic">Sh&#257;hn&#257;mah: Abridgment and Selections</span>, which included the earlier episode of <span class="italic">Sohr&#257;b</span>, was published by the Oriental Translation Fund and was awarded its gold medal. Atkinson translated several books from Persian into competent English verse. His <span class="italic">Expedition into Affghanistan</span> provides an interesting personal narrative, supplemented by his <span class="italic">Sketches in Affghanistan</span> (1842) containing a series of lithographed drawings which complete the picture of what was then an unexplored country. He also had a talent for portraiture&#151;several of his works, including a self-portrait, are in the National Portrait Gallery. Atkinson's first published poem was a romance called &#145;Rodolpho&#146; (1801). He also wrote <span class="italic">The Aubid: an Eastern Tale</span>, in verse (1819), and made translations from Italian verse. In 1832 he published <span class="italic">The Customs and Manners of the Women of Persia</span>, an amusing translation of a Persian essay on harem life. His one professional treatise was <span class="italic">Description of the New Process of Perforating and Destroying the Stone in the Bladder</span> (1831). Accomplished in literature and art, both a scholar and a popular writer, James Atkinson was a pioneer of oriental research.<br>
