<span class="headword">Bradlaw, Sir  Robert Vivian</span>  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">dentist</span>, was born on 14 April 1905 at 7 Rathmines Road, Blackrock, Dublin, the son of Philip Archibald Bradlaw, dentist, and his wife, Henrietta Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Samuel. He was a member of a large family with medical and dental connections. His father died when Bradlaw was in his early teens, and he completed his general education at Cranleigh after he and his mother had moved to England. He subsequently studied both dentistry and medicine in London at Guy's Hospital, gaining his LDS in 1926 and MRCS LRCP in 1928. After qualifying he did a spell as a ship's surgeon, visiting the Far East, and also undertook some private dental practice. He also held part-time academic appointments, as a demonstrator at the Royal Dental Hospital in Leicester Square, where he undertook research into the nerve supply of dentine, and at the National Hospital in Queen Square.<br>
<br>By the mid-1930s Bradlaw had decided on the longer-term direction of his career, resolving to devote himself in part to advancing the discipline of dental surgery, which was still emerging as a learned profession, and at the same time establishing himself in the burgeoning dental academic world. In 1936 he was appointed to the newly established chair of dental surgery at the then small dental school at Newcastle upon Tyne, within the University of Durham. He became dean, and with considerable vision began the transference of function and power from visiting consultants, who hitherto had been the only people available to run dental schools, to a system involving a core of full-time staff who not only could teach but who also, like their medical counterparts, possessed the expertise and responsibility to advance knowledge. He acted also as a consultant to the ministries of Pensions and Supply and the Royal Navy, and served on two influential national bodies, the Central Health Services Council and the government's standing dental advisory committee, of which he became chairman. His influence on dental education during this period was far-reaching and profound, and in the post-war years the developments he had instituted in Newcastle became the model for fundamental changes in the pattern of undergraduate dental education throughout the country.<br>
<br>However, by the late 1930s Bradlaw's interests were extending on a broader front to encompass postgraduate, as well as undergraduate, dental education, and also the professional political processes governing the provision of the country's dental services. He made a substantial impact nationally in these areas during the war years and afterwards, when his forward-ranging vision was ahead of that of most of his contemporaries. As dean of the Newcastle dental school he served as a member of the Dental Board of the United Kingdom, the governing body of the profession operating under the auspices of the General Medical Council. In 1943 he became a member of the Teviot committee, set up by the minister of health to consider the measures needed to improve dental education, research, and legislation. One recommendation in the final report of the committee in 1946 was that the Dental Board should be replaced by an independent General Dental Council. Bradlaw was also involved with other luminaries, including Sir Alfred Webb Johnson, Sir Wilfred Fish, and Sir William Kelsey Fry, in setting up a faculty of dental surgery within the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This was established by supplemental charter in 1947 and, in recognition of his major contribution, Bradlaw was appointed as the first dean of the faculty. He was Hunterian professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1955, receiving the Colyer gold medal in the same year and the honorary gold medal of the college in 1968. During his period as dean he initiated the examination for the fellowship in dental surgery, analogous to the FRCS in general surgery. In 1974 he delivered the first Bradlaw oration at the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>In 1960, after twenty-four years of notable contribution to the university and its dental school, Bradlaw left Newcastle and returned to London to become dean and director of studies at the Institute of Dental Surgery, director of the Eastman Dental Hospital, and professor of oral medicine in the University of London, posts which he held until he retired in 1970. He was an accomplished lecturer, his field of special interest being the manifestations in the mouth of general disease. His presentations were enriched with knowledge and experience gained from his own research. In 1954 he received the British Dental Association's Howard Mummery prize for his work on oral syphilis, and was also a recipient of the Tomes prize.<br>
<br>Under the <span class="roman">Dentists Act</span> 1956, the General Dental Council was created to replace the Dental Board of the United Kingdom. Bradlaw, a member of the new council from the outset, became president in 1964, succeeding Sir Wilfred Fish, previously chairman of the Dental Board. He retired as president in 1974. In his presidential address in 1973 he advocated the inclusion of items of preventive dental treatment in the National Health Service's general dental service scale of fees&#151;an innovative concept for its time. He was also very active in the British Dental Association, serving as a member of its representative board, and as president of the association in 1974.<br>
<br>As well as holding various postgraduate qualifications and diplomas, Bradlaw was the recipient of many honours, including doctorates from ten universities. Of particular satisfaction to him was the degree of doctor of civil law awarded by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1965. In 1975 he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. He was also chevalier de la sant&eacute; publique (France); knight, order of St Olaf (Norway); and commander, order of Homayoun (Iran). He was appointed CBE in 1950 and knighted in 1965.<br>
<br>Bradlaw was a widely read, cultivated man with diverse interests, including cooking, eighteenth-century paintings, Chinese and Korean celadon ware china, fashioning pottery, and cultivating orchids. All these subjects were studied with the same dedication that he devoted to his professional activities. In his Newcastle days he liked in addition to shoot and fish, while golf was a challenge which he pursued with vigour. Some time during mid-life he became a Roman Catholic, deriving great spiritual comfort from his religion for the rest of his life. Although essentially a private man, he was also a sociable and convivial host. His unobtrusive kindnesses were appreciated by many, yet he had a dignified, serious demeanour which appeared formidable to subordinate colleagues. He was a shrewd judge of junior colleagues' abilities and potential, and gave valuable career guidance to many. His wit and self-deprecating sense of humour were well known; when he arrived for a meeting at the University Senate House on the morning his knighthood was announced, he recounted with much glee how, in the railway carriage on his way into London, one avid reader of <span class="italic">The Times</span> turned to his neighbour and said &#145;look at the people they give knighthoods to these days&#146;  (private information). He never married. He died on 12 February 1992 at Stoke Goldington, near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, the place to which he had retired. In his will he requested that there should be no announcement of his death and no memorial service.<br>
