<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clarke,  Nicholas Campbell <span class="st"> [Nick]</span></span>  (1948&#150;2006), <span class="occ">broadcaster and writer</span>, was born on 9 June 1948 at Mount Alvernia Nursing Home, Godalming, Surrey, the son of John Campbell Clarke, journalist, and his wife, (Wilda) Ruth, formerly Massy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McNeile. He was educated at Bradfield College, Berkshire, and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. After graduating he spent two years as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, before joining the BBC in Manchester in 1973, &#145;on condition&#146;, he recalled, that &#145;I shaved off my very large beard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Radio Times</span>, 11 Dec 1993). Within three years he had been appointed industrial correspondent, and by 1980 was reporting for BBC2's <span class="italic">The Money Programme</span>. In the mid-1980s he appeared on BBC2's <span class="italic">Newsnight</span> as political correspondent and presenter. However, it was radio rather than television that increasingly appealed to his sense of seriousness. From 1989 he took the presenter's job on BBC Radio 4's Sunday lunchtime current affairs programme, <span class="italic">The World This Weekend</span>, and over the next five years he frequently stood in on <span class="italic">Any Questions?</span>, <span class="italic">Any Answers?</span>, and <span class="italic">The World at One</span>. During the Gulf War of 1991, when Radio 4 turned one of its frequencies into a &#145;rolling-news&#146; service, he was a key anchorman, at ease occasionally conducting an interview in fluent French while simultaneously providing his own running translation. It was, one reviewer suggested, largely through the &#145;sober tact&#146; of Clarke and his fellow presenters that the BBC's first rolling-news service established itself as &#145;urgent without being hysterical&#146;, confounding the worst expectations of its critics  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 22 Jan 1991);  (Hendy, 348).<br>
<br>Clarke's skill as a political interviewer was put to best use after 1994 when he became the full-time presenter of <span class="italic">The World at One</span>. Politicians, journalists, and listeners noted that he always asked clear questions and insisted on proper answers, though he would never &#145;growl, bark or nip&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 Aug 1993). &#145;I don't like interruptions&#146;, he once explained; &#145;I believe it's nearly always possible to find a pause, however microscopic, into which a question can be inserted&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Oct 1995). Commentators regarded such unyielding civility, and the &#145;surgeon's instinct for the political raw nerve&#146; it belied, as something to be cherished in what seemed like an increasingly frantic media culture  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 27 Feb 1994). This was confirmed in 1999 when the Voice of the Listener and Viewer organization made him radio broadcaster of the year and again in 2000 when the Broadcasting Press Guild voted him broadcaster of the year. Both awards acknowledged not just the quality of his journalism but his wider contribution to the medium of radio. When Radio 4's <span class="italic">Round Britain Quiz</span> was revived in 1997 Clarke's inquiring but unobtrusive style made him the obvious choice as question-master. He was equally well suited to chairing <span class="italic">Straw Poll</span>, a live public debating series broadcast in 2004 and 2005.<br>
<br>Clarke, once described by a columnist as &#145;Radio 4 personified&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 Nov 2006), briefly contemplated writing a history of his favourite network. He had already published in 1999 a well-received biography of another Radio 4 figure, Alistair Cooke, and it had sold well. In the event his follow-up was <span class="italic">Shadow of a Nation</span> (2003), an elegiac and highly personal reflection on the changing character of Britain, in which he despaired of a growing celebrity culture and lamented the &#145;draining away&#146; of social cohesion. The national psyche, he believed, was gradually being debased through television's &#145;staple diet of spurious fame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shadow of a Nation</span>, 3&#150;7).<br>
<br>Away from this diminishing public realm, Clarke found regular consolation in the private pleasures of fine wine, cooking, cricket, and, above all, family life. His first marriage, on 13 October 1973, was to the journalist Susan Katharine (Sue) Armstrong. Aged twenty-one at the time of their marriage, she was the daughter of Philip Bryan Armstrong, solicitor. They had two sons and one daughter (twins Alison and Tom, followed by Pete) before the marriage was dissolved in 1990. In the following year he married the television producer Barbara Want, with whom he had twin boys. Benedict and Joel were still young children when, in November 2005, Clarke (whose father had died of cancer when Clarke was eighteen) discovered a lump on his left buttock, a metastatic sarcoma that forced him to have his left leg amputated. He and his wife recorded an audio diary throughout his illness, and much of it was heard on Radio 4 in June 2006 as the documentary <span class="italic">Fighting to be Normal</span>. Clarke worried that broadcasting a personal story was &#145;inappropriate&#146; for BBC presenters, but listeners wrote in their thousands to say how moved they had been and how much he was being missed. Soon after its broadcast he returned to presenting <span class="italic">The World at One</span>. But the respite was brief. The cancer had spread, and Clarke died on 23 November 2006 at his home in Highlever Road, Kensington. He was survived by his wife and his five children.<br>
