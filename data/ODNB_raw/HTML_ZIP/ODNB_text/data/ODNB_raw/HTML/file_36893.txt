<span class="headword">Wilbraham, Sir  Philip Wilbraham  Baker</span>, sixth baronet  (1875&#150;1957), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical lawyer and administrator</span>, was born at Rode Hall, Scholar Green, Cheshire, on 17 September 1875, the younger and only surviving son of Sir George Barrington Baker, fifth baronet (1845&#150;1912), who took the additional surname of Wilbraham by royal licence in 1900, and his wife, Katharine Frances (<i>d</i>. 1945), only child of General Sir Richard Wilbraham. A descendant of Sir George Baker, the physician who demonstrated the possibility of poisoning through the use of leaden vessels, notably in the manufacture of Devonshire cider, Wilbraham succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1912. He was educated at Harrow School, where he was a scholar and head of the school, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was an exhibitioner and obtained a first in classical moderations (1896) and second classes in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1898) and jurisprudence (1899). Standing as a candidate in law he was elected a fellow of All Souls College in 1899 but having married in the meantime was unable to renew his fellowship when it expired in 1906; he retained a deep affection for All Souls throughout his life. On 8 August 1901 he married Joyce Christabel (<i>d</i>. 1958), daughter of Sir John Henry Kennaway, third baronet. They had three daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Entering the chambers of Charles Sargant, Wilbraham was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1901 and practised, though not with the compulsion which lack of means might have supplied. Confining his interest to ecclesiastical matters, he was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Chester (1913), chancellor and vicar-general of York (1915), and chancellor of the dioceses of Truro (1923), Chelmsford (1928), and Durham (1929). He held these offices until his appointment in 1934 as dean of the arches, master of the faculties, and vicar-general of the province of Canterbury, and auditor of the chancery court of York. These appointments he resigned in 1955 owing to failing health. As dean of the arches Wilbraham became a judge of the highest ecclesiastical court. His reputation is overshadowed among lawyers by that of his immediate predecessor Sir Lewis Dibdin. Few appeals came before him and throughout the war the court was little used. A pre-war case (St Hilary) was heard by deputy since Wilbraham himself had already been consulted as chancellor of the diocese of Truro. The three reported judgments of Wilbraham were Ogbourne St George (1941), St Saviour's Walthamstow (1950), and Lapford (1954).<br>
<br>Wilbraham was one of the original members of the church assembly and its first secretary (1920); he resigned the secretaryship in 1939 on accepting from the crown the office of first church estates commissioner, remaining, however, an active member of the assembly. His influence on the assembly during its formative years was very great. His co-operation with Lord Hugh Cecil produced the rules for conducting the assembly's business, the one supplying the legal experience and the other knowledge of parliamentary procedure. As member and secretary of the assembly he was also member and secretary of all the committees; he used the power thus given so constructively as to earn everybody's complete trust. It fell to him not only to prepare reports and the preliminary drafts of measures, work he especially enjoyed, but also to expound often complicated clauses to the assembly. This he did in short, careful sentences, impossible to misunderstand and entirely convincing by their reasoned impartiality. In the verbatim record his speeches stand out from others in the debates. His refusal to fight and his advocacy of acceptable compromises counteracted that divisive tendency, induced by suspicions between differing schools of churchmanship, which might have marred the assembly's work.<br>
<br>To administration, as first church estates commissioner, Wilbraham in 1939 came late. He entered office expecting to carry through amalgamation of the ecclesiastical commissioners and Queen Anne's Bounty, plans for which had already been laid. And as a countryman who owned farmland in Cheshire he especially looked forward to visiting the estates. But with the outbreak of war came instead adaptation of curtailed activities to war conditions and the evacuation of sections of the two offices to different parts of the country. Estate visits proved impracticable and he had to give up his London house. Case work and preparation for the future occupied him. Yet it was a period of greatest happiness; gradualness suited his inclination. He had time to grow into the work and to love it. When the delayed amalgamation matured after the war he was qualified as nobody else (and not even he earlier) to complete it. Trying negotiations were followed by legislation which might easily have become dangerously controversial. The successful launching of the church commissioners in 1948 and their harmonious development over the first five critical years testify to his skill and patience in leadership. He liked to carry everybody with him. The deliberately slower pace he preferred provided a firm foundation for greater advances to follow. Nevertheless, it was in his time that the commissioners' over-large agricultural holdings were reduced and their reinvestment of securities began. He put through the assembly the measure (diocesan stipends funds, 1953) which freed large holdings of trustee stocks for profitable reinvestment. He retired in 1954 and was appointed KBE in the same year.<br>
<br>By virtue of tenure of the Rode estate Wilbraham was high steward of Congleton from 1912; he was a JP for the county of Cheshire from 1919; he was appointed commissary by the dean and chapter of St Paul's in 1942. Archbishop Lang conferred on him the Lambeth degree of DCL in 1936 and he was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1942. He died at his home, Rode Hall, on 11 October 1957; his son Randle John Baker Wilbraham (1906&#150;1980) succeeded in the baronetcy.<br>
<br>Tall, somewhat forbidding, Wilbraham exhibited the gravity of innate shyness covering natural friendliness. He lost his reserve in the Athenaeum billiard-room. At home at Rode with his wife, who was of the utmost help to him, he was a delightful host. That the church formed the centre of his interests was no accident. He was in the best sense a good churchman, deeply religious, conducting family prayers each morning in the old tradition.<br>
