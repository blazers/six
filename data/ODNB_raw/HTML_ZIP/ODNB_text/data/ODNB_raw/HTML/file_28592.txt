<span class="headword">Walpole <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Pauper]</span>,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1560, <em>d.</em> 1637), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was the son and heir of John Walpole (<i>d</i>. 1588) of Houghton, Norfolk, and Catherine Calibut (<i>d</i>. 1612) of Coxford in the same county, and was baptized on 28 January 1560 at Houghton. Educated at Norwich School between approximately 1571 and 1576 he matriculated as a fellow-commoner at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in May 1576, the year after his cousin Henry Walpole, also later a Jesuit, had entered the same college as a pensioner. In 1580 or 1581 Edward was admitted to Lincoln's Inn from Furnival's Inn. Here, as at Cambridge, he was influenced by his older cousin, especially in religious matters. Edward, raised a strict protestant, was gradually won over to Roman Catholicism. According to Henry Foley, Edward's parents were so distressed by their son's increasingly popish sentiments and by his resolution to adhere to the Roman church that they complained to the privy council. As a result Henry fled to the continent, arriving in Rheims in July 1582. Edward's parents fought back: they engaged protestant ministers first in Norfolk and then in London to demonstrate popish errors through disputation. Failure to do so resulted in Edward's being disowned by his family and thrown out of Houghton in 1585. Assuming the name of Pauper to mark his new identity he &#145;gave proof of a nobler spirit than was implied in the splendour of any earthly descent&#146;  (Foley, 2.260).<br>
<br>Edward's plans to follow his cousin to the continent were frustrated, so he returned to Norfolk where another cousin, William Walpole, who shared his religious sentiments, offered him asylum at Tuddenham. Edward repaid his generosity by reconciling William to his wife, Mary Blackwell, from whom he had been for some years estranged. In October 1587 William died, leaving the great bulk of his large property to his cousin Edward, subject to the life interest of his widow.<br>
<br>In April of 1588 Edward's father died, leaving all to his second son, Calibut, and not even naming his elder son in the will. Five months later Robert, earl of Leicester, died. The earl had a life interest in the estates of his first wife, Amy Robsart, which lay contiguous to those of the Walpoles, and these now descended to Edward Walpole as heir-at-law to Sir John Robsart, Amy's father. Edward at once surrendered by deed all claim and title on the Robsart and the Houghton estates to his brother Calibut, and the estates accordingly descended through him to Sir Robert Walpole and the earls of Oxford. Similarly Edward sold the reversion of the manor of Tuddenham for 1000 marks.<br>
<br>In 1589 the Jesuit John Gerard began his successful missionary work among Norfolk recusant gentry and it was he who formally reconciled Edward Walpole to the Roman church. Under the Jesuit's direction Edward slipped away to the continent. Admitted to the English College, Rome, on 23 October 1590 he was ordained on the feast of the Ascension, 7 May 1592, in the college chapel. He departed for Flanders in May 1593 and entered the noviciate of the province on 4 July, pronouncing his first vows as a Jesuit on 25 December 1594. On 8 July 1595 he was sent to Louvain, where he studied humanities for two years before doing pastoral work in Brussels and Antwerp. By 1598 he was in England, where he remained until his death. On 21 May 1609 he was solemnly professed of the three vows in London.<br>
<br>In 1621 he was superior of the Jesuits in the Worcestershire district. In 1623 he was named superior of the residence of the Blessed Stanislaus (Devon). Upon completing his three-year term, he was transferred to the residence of St Dominic (Lincolnshire), where he was superior from at least 1628 until 1630. From 1631 until 1633 he was at the residence of St Thomas of Canterbury (Hampshire). In 1634&#150;5 he worked from the house of probation of St Ignatius (London) and in 1636 at the College of the Holy Apostles, recently established by Lord Petre, in East Anglia. Some time in 1637 Walpole returned to London where he died on 3 November 1637.<br>
<br>Walpole translated Louis Richeome's <span class="italic">The Pilgrime of Loreto</span> (1629), a notable example of the Salesian spirituality then fashionable.<br>
