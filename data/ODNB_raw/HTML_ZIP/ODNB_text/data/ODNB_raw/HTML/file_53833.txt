<span class="headword">Newsome,  James</span>  (1824&#150;1912), <span class="occ">equestrian performer and circus proprietor</span>, the son of Christopher and Mary Newsome, was baptized in Newcastle upon Tyne on 1 June 1824. His elder brother, Timothy (1813&#150;1890), was a celebrated lion tamer. James was indentured to William Batty, the lessee of Astley's Amphitheatre, London, in 1836, and became famous as a horse tamer, trainer, and trick rider. He was a great favourite with circus audiences both in London and the provinces.<br>
<br>On 17 May 1846 Newsome married Pauline Hinn&eacute; [<a name="cosubject_53840"></a><span class="headword">Pauline Newsome</span>  (<em>c.</em>1825&#150;1904)], an equestrian performer with whom he sometimes rode in double acts. Hinn&eacute; was a member of a famous French circus family, the fourth daughter of Johann Hinn&eacute; and his wife, Franzisca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Zinsberger, and was born in Berlin. She travelled to Britain with her family about 1845 and became principal dancer on horseback at Astley's. Following their marriage, the couple sought their fortunes abroad and spent six years with Franconi's Cirque Olympique at Paris, where Newsome was engaged as principal horseman. Afterwards the Newsomes visited Belgium and Germany, and returned to England late in 1852 with their three daughters, Adelaide, Emma, and Marie. Three more daughters, Ella, Pauline, and Virginie, were born in Britain. The Newsomes initially joined Hernandez and Stone's circus, with whom James Newsome went into partnership in 1854&#150;5. He became a partner with Pablo Fanque for the 1855&#150;6 season.<br>
<br>In 1853 Pauline Newsome toured for the season as &#145;Madame Pauline Newsome's French Troupe&#146;, and repeated the experience in 1856. By 1859 Newsome's circus was established. The company travelled the country, staying several weeks or months at each venue, and using specially erected buildings rather than tents. The family prospered; Madame Newsome directed the business arrangements of the circus, while her husband was horse trainer and equestrian director. All six of the Newsome daughters were equestrian performers, and were noted in the hunting field as well as in the ring.<br>
<br>A fire at their circus in Edinburgh in 1887 causing damage estimated at &pound;7000 brought about a change in the family's fortunes, and they were forced to sell up in 1889 after a poor season in Sunderland. The family dispersed to other circuses, and eventually Pauline and James Newsome retired to Cleethorpes, where they lived near their daughter Virginie, who was now married. Pauline Newsome died there on 25 September 1904; James Newsome survived her until 1 January 1912. They were both buried in the Beacon Avenue cemetery, Cleethorpes.<br>
