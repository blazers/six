<span class="headword">Lindsay family of the Byres</span>  (<em>per. </em>1367&#150;1526), <span class="occ">landowners</span>, were members of the extended Lindsay family which had first settled in Scotland in the twelfth century and whose estates included Byres in Haddingtonshire no later than 1241. The Lindsays were prominent in the entourage of David II, and on 17 January 1367 Sir William Lindsay, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54261/', "David Lindsay of Crawford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54260/', "Lindsay family of Barnweill, Crawford, and Glenesk (per. c.1250&#150;c.1400)")</script>], received from the king a grant entailing upon himself and his male heirs the land of the Byres, which had been resigned for the purpose by William's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74925/', "Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54260/', "Lindsay family of Barnweill, Crawford, and Glenesk (per. c.1250&#150;c.1400)")</script>]. Sir William married Christiana, daughter of Sir William Mure of Abercorn, and thereby obtained the barony of Abercorn in Linlithgowshire. He became a retainer of the earl of Douglas after the death of David II, but may have returned to the king's affinity by the time of his own death, before 1 July 1393.<br>
<br>Sir William's son and heir, another <a name="cosubject_54269"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Lindsay of the Byres</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1414)<span class="occ"></span>, married Christian, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15275/', "Sir William Keith")</script>, the marischal [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54235/', "Keith family")</script>], receiving through her the barony and castle of Dunnottar, although in 1392 he exchanged these properties with the Keiths for the lands of Crawford Priory in Fife. He received a pension from Robert III in 1394 in recognition of his services to the crown, and in 1413 he founded a chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity in St Andrews Cathedral. He died in 1414 and was succeeded by his son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54270"></a><span class="headword">John Lindsay</span>, first Lord Lindsay of the Byres  (<em>d.</em> 1482)<span class="occ"></span>, received a safe conduct to go to James I at Durham in 1423, and he was one of the original hostages sent to England in 1424 as pledges for the payment of the king's ransom. He returned to Scotland in the first exchange of hostages the following year, but his subsequent career is obscure until he appears once more in active royal service by January 1440, serving the king from his Lothian base which, as it included the barony of Abercorn, would have connected him with the Black Douglases who held the castle of Abercorn. He witnessed a Douglas indenture on 26 August 1447, but, in the crisis between the king and the Black Douglases in the 1450s, he stood with James II at the crucial time just after the killing of the earl of Douglas on 22 February 1452, witnessing charters granted by the king at Lochmaben and Jedburgh on 2 March, and he remained with him throughout that year's summer campaign, acting thereafter as a regular witness to royal charters.<br>
<br>The exact date at which John Lindsay was created a lord of parliament is uncertain. He appears in a list, appended to Walter Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span>, of men said to hold Scottish peerages by 1445. However, his title in the witness lists in the register of the great seal changes from John Lindsay of Byres on 2 March 1452, to John, Lord Lindsay of Byres, on 12 May 1452, indicating that official royal sanction was given at that time, specifically, it would seem, for support during the crisis with the Black Douglases. It may have been diplomatic services connected with the downfall of the Douglases that led to Lindsay travelling abroad, for, according to the exchequer accounts, he was in Flanders between 13 September 1455 and 7 July 1456. In 1457 he was appointed justiciar north of Forth, becoming a lord of session on 6 March 1458, and was appointed to hear petitions in parliament in 1466 and from 1468 to 1479. He married a daughter of Robert Stewart of Lorne and died on 6 February 1482, being succeeded by his son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54271"></a><span class="headword">David Lindsay</span>, second Lord Lindsay of the Byres  (<em>d.</em> 1490)<span class="occ"></span>, was a staunch supporter of James III. He was present with the king in Edinburgh in May 1488, and is alleged to have brought 1000 horse and 3000 infantry to the king's assistance at Sauchieburn, and to have presented James III with the large grey horse on which the king fled from the battlefield. However, beyond the fact that Lindsay was at the battle, the details are exaggerations by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, a descendant of David Lindsay's youngest brother, Patrick. David Lindsay married Janet, daughter of Walter Ramsay of Pitcruvie, but died childless in 1490. He was consequently succeeded by his brother John, third Lord Lindsay of the Byres, who was infeft as heir on 25 January 1492. John married Marion, daughter of Sir William Baillie of Lamington, but he also died childless, between 29 September and 5 November 1497, being succeeded by his younger brother.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54272"></a><span class="headword">Patrick Lindsay</span>, fourth Lord Lindsay of the Byres  (<em>d.</em> 1526)<span class="occ"></span>, was styled Patrick Lindsay of Kirkforthar before succeeding to his brother's title and estates. The story of his appearing as advocate in defence of his brother David when the latter was tried for treason after Sauchieburn, causing him to cry out in pain by standing on his sore foot, appears to be another of Pitscottie's embellishments of his ancestors' exploits. On 28 October 1497 Patrick Lindsay received a charter confirming him in the lands and barony of Byres, in addition to a precept infefting him in the barony of Abercorn. He survived Flodden (where he is said to have urged James IV not to fight in person), and on 1 December 1513 was one of the four lords appointed to advise the queen, while in July 1525 he received the office of sheriff of Fife. He married Isabella, daughter of Henry Pitcairn of that ilk, and died in 1526, his burial taking place at St Andrews. He was succeeded in quick succession by his son and grandson, both named John.<br>
