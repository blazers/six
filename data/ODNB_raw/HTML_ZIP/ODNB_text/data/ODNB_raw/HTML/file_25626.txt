<span class="headword">Sinclair,  John</span>, styled eleventh Lord Sinclair <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>master of Sinclair]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1683, <em>d.</em> 1750), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer and writer</span>, the eldest son of Henry, tenth Lord Sinclair (<i>bap</i>. 1660, <i>d</i>. 1723)&#151;a new creation under the great seal, in June 1677, with the former precedency&#151;and Barbara Cockburn, daughter of Sir James Cockburn of Cockburn, was baptized on 5 December 1683. Entering the army at an early age, John held a captain-lieutenant's rank in Preston's regiment, under the duke of Marlborough. Having been accused by Ensign Hugh Schaw of cowardice during the battle of Wynendaal, Sinclair and Schaw fought with swords in 1708. Schaw was mortally wounded during the encounter. His brother, Captain Alexander Schaw of the Royals, thereupon asserted that Sinclair had previously protected his breast with paper. Resenting this reflection on his courage and honour, Sinclair encountered Schaw at the head of his regiment and, failing to obtain a denial or apology, shot him dead. It was found that Schaw's hand had been laid on his pistol while Sinclair shot him, and it may have been that Sinclair fired either in self-defence or after due warning, but with &#145;no seconds at either encounter&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 11.744) his fights with the Schaws could hardly be called duels. On his being tried by court martial in the camp on 17 October 1708, his acts were declared to be a breach of the tenth article of war, and he was sentenced to death. Through the duke of Marlborough the case was recommended to the consideration of the queen's privy council, who pronounced the act to be wilful murder; but before the sentence could be carried out Sinclair escaped, probably with Marlborough's connivance, from the camp to the Prussian dominions, and he remained abroad until he received a pardon in 1712.<br>
<br>In 1708 Sinclair was chosen member of parliament for the county of Fife, but, even if the election had not been declared void by reason of his being the eldest son of a peer, it would have been rendered void by the sentence of death. On his return to Scotland, after receiving pardon, he continued to reside at Dysart, Fife, until he was summoned to join the standard under the earl of Mar in 1715. He obeyed the summons with reluctance, not because of lukewarmness as a Jacobite, for indeed he was a passionate patriot and opponent of union, but because he had little or no faith in Mar's ability. Still, to him belongs the credit of one of the brilliant Jacobite achievements of the campaign. Sinclair learned that a vessel with arms and stores from the castle of Edinburgh, intended for the retainers of the earl of Sutherland in the north of Scotland, had been brought to anchor near Burntisland. He set out from Perth with 400 horse and reached Burntisland at midnight. Without losing a moment, a detachment of his soldiers seized some boats in the harbour, boarded the vessel without resistance, and thus obtained 420 complete stand of arms. However, at the battle of Sheriffmuir his action was not at all in keeping with this daring exploit. In command of the Fife and Aberdeenshire horse, he was attached to the division which advanced towards Dunblane. This division met the left wing of Argyll's army and was victorious; but Sinclair, though he writes in high praise of the incredible vigour and rapidity of the Jacobite attack, himself did nothing to turn it to account.<br>
<br>On the return of Mar's forces to Perth, Sinclair left the camp and went north to Strathbogie, and thence to Orkney, where he at last found a vessel to take him to the continent. He was associated with the marquess of Huntly's party, which sought to make peace with the government, an action which led to Jacobite scorn for Sinclair:<blockquote>
<div>The Master with the bully-face,<br>
</div>
<div>And with the coward's heart, man,<br>
</div>
<div>Who never missed, to his disgrace,<br>
</div>
<div>To act the traitor's part, man.<br>
</div> (Sinclair, xix)</blockquote>Being attainted for his share in the rising, Sinclair remained abroad until 1726, when he received a pardon as regards his life, but without remission of the other consequences of the attainder. On his return to Scotland he received back the estates at the hands of his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25622/', "General James Sinclair")</script>, in accordance with the legal formula drawn up to evade the &#145;consequences of the attainder&#146;  (Sinclair, xiii). In 1736 he gained an act of parliament enabling him to inherit property but not the title. He married first, on 16 August 1733, Lady Margaret Stewart, eldest daughter of James, fifth earl of Galloway, and Catherine Montgomerie, dowager of James, fifth earl of Southesk. Lady Margaret died at Edinburgh on 22 July 1747 and was buried at Dysart. On 24 April 1750 he married Amelia (1732&#150;1777), eldest daughter of Lord George Murray and sister of John, third duke of Atholl. Neither marriage produced children. Sinclair died at Dysart on 2 November 1750.<br>
<br>Sinclair's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Rebellion</span>, published by the Roxburghe Club in 1858, are curiously cynical and sarcastic, highly critical of the earl of Mar, graphic and clever, and of great value for the light they throw on the inner history of the Jacobite rising. Sinclair has also been credited with the authorship of <span class="italic">A True Account of the Proceedings at Perth</span> (1716), which provided an account of the debates over and decision to end the Jacobite rising; however, Sinclair's authorship is doubtful as he had left the camp before these debates commenced.<br>
