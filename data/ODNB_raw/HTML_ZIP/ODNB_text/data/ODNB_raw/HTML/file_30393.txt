<span class="headword">Allies,  Thomas William</span>  (1813&#150;1903), <span class="occ">theologian and Roman Catholic convert</span>, born at Midsomer Norton, Somerset, on 12 February 1813, was the son of Thomas Allies, curate of Henbury, Bristol, and later rector of Wormington, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth Fripp, daughter of a Bristol merchant. His mother died a week after his birth, and he was brought up by his father's second wife, Caroline Hillhouse. After education at Bristol grammar school he entered Eton College in April 1827 under Edward Coleridge. There in 1829 he was the first winner of the Newcastle scholarship. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1828, where he was exhibitioner in 1830&#150;33; he graduated BA with a first class in classics in 1832, proceeded MA in 1837, and was fellow from 1833 until 1841 and humanity lecturer in 1838&#150;9.<br>
<br>After a religious conversion in 1837 Allies took holy orders the following year and, under the influence of William Dodsworth, became a committed Tractarian. From 1840 to 1842 he was examining chaplain to Dr Blomfield, bishop of London, but the latter found Allies's Tractarian sympathies uncongenial and in June 1842 relegated him to the living of Launton, near Bicester. His pugnacious disposition, which along with his small stature and dapper appearance won him among his friends the nickname of the Bantam Cock, did not endear him to his episcopal superiors. On 1 October 1840 he married Eliza Hall Newman, the sister of Thomas Harding Newman, a fellow student at Oxford. There were five sons and two daughters of the marriage. In June 1842 he first met J. H. Newman, to whom he increasingly turned for guidance. Travels in France in 1845 and 1847 with John Hungerford Pollen quickened his doubt of the validity of the Anglican position, and a statement of his views in his <span class="italic">Journal in France</span> (1848) incurred the disapproval of Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford. Study of the fathers, and especially of Su&aacute;rez's work <span class="italic">De erroribus sectae Anglicanae</span>, combined with the Gorham decision on baptismal regeneration in 1850, undermined his faith in the established church, and in his work <span class="italic">Royal Supremacy</span> (1850) he forcefully presented the Roman Catholic point of view.<br>
<br>In October 1850 Allies resigned his Launton living and joined the Roman Catholic church&#151;a step which his wife had taken five months previously. He moved to Golden Square, London, where he took pupils, and then to The Priory, 21 North Bank, St John's Wood, later the residence of George Eliot. From August 1853 until his retirement on a pension in 1890 he was secretary of the Catholic poor school committee in John Street, Adelphi (instituted in 1847), and actively promoted Catholic primary education. To his energy was largely due the foundation of the Notre Dame Training College, Liverpool, in 1855, the Sacred Heart Training College for Women, Wandsworth, in 1874, and St Mary's Training College for Men at Hammersmith. As honorary secretary of the Education Crisis Fund (1870&#150;73) he successfully raised &pound;50,000 to enable the Catholic community to meet the demands of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He was appointed in March 1855 the first professor of modern history at the new Catholic University of Ireland, Dublin, under Newman's rectorship. He soon resigned the post because of a dearth of students, but his proposed course of lectures formed the basis of his voluminous <span class="italic">The Formation of Christendom</span> (8 vols., 1865&#150;95). The work trenchantly expounds the predominance in history of the see of Peter.<br>
<br>Among Allies's intimate friends in his last years were Lord Acton, the Catholic historian, and Aubrey de Vere, who addressed a sonnet to him on the publication of the sixth volume of <span class="italic">The Formation of Christendom</span> in 1888. In 1885 Pope Leo XIII created him knight commander of St Gregory, and in 1893 he received the pope's gold medal for merit. In 1897 his health declined; he died at his home, 3 Lodge Place, St John's Wood, on 17 June 1903, and was buried at St Mary Magdalene's, Mortlake, by the side of his wife. She had predeceased him on 24 January 1902. Allies, one of the most learned of the Oxford converts to Rome, keenly felt his marginalization: &#145;My malady has been that I have a mind and education above my station&#146;  (Allies, 79). He traced the growth of his opinions in his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Life's Decision</span> (1880). His principal works of controversy, in defence of the papal claims, were reprinted in <span class="italic">Per crucem ad lucem</span> (2 vols., 1879), and a memoir by his daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55544/', "Mary Allies")</script>, was published in 1907.<br>
