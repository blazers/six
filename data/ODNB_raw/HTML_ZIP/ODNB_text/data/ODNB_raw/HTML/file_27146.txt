<span class="headword">Terrot,  Charles Hughes</span>  (1790&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Edinburgh</span>, born at Cuddalore, India, on 19 September 1790, was a descendant of a Huguenot family. His father, Elias Terrot, a captain in the Indian army, was killed at the siege of Bangalore within weeks of his son's birth. His mother, whose maiden name was Mary Fonteneau, returned to England and settled with her son at Berwick upon Tweed. From the age of nine he was educated at the home of the Revd John Fawcett of Carlisle, and later attended Carlisle grammar school. In 1808 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated BA in 1812. He was elected a fellow of his college in 1813 and in the same year was ordained deacon.<br>
<br>Ordained priest in 1814 by the bishop of Chester, Terrot became minister of the episcopal congregation at Haddington, a position formerly held by his uncle, the Revd William Terrot. This was a &#145;qualified chapel&#146; of Scottish episcopalians who had conformed to the Hanoverian dynasty in the early eighteenth century and thus qualified for legal toleration. They were not in communion with the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal church, having adopted the English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and being staffed by clergymen ordained in the Church of England. Terrot led this congregation into union with the Scottish Episcopal church in 1815, a union made possible by the Scottish episcopalians' renunciation of Jacobitism in 1788 and their adoption of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> in 1804. While at Haddington, Terrot devoted his leisure to poetry, winning the Cambridge University Seatonian prize in 1816 for his poem &#145;Hezekiah and Sennacherib&#146;. In 1817 he went to Edinburgh as colleague to James Walker (later bishop of Edinburgh), with whom he shared the charge of St Peter's, Roxburgh Place. Terrot was married in 1818 to Sarah Ingram (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of Captain Samuel Wood of Minlands, near Berwick upon Tweed. They had fourteen children, six of whom predeceased Terrot. His eldest daughter, Sarah Anne Terrot, was the third woman to join the Sisterhood of the Holy Cross (Park Village Sisterhood), founded by Edward Pusey in 1845. She nursed British forces in the Crimea with Florence Nightingale, and was afterwards awarded the Royal Red Cross. From 1829 to 1833 Terrot was in sole charge of St Peter's, and in 1833 he became one of three clergy at St Paul's, York Place, Edinburgh. In 1837 he was appointed dean of Edinburgh and Fife, in 1839 rector of St Paul's, and in 1841 bishop of Edinburgh and Pantonian professor at the theological college (while retaining the charge of St Paul's).<br>
<br>On the death of William Skinner (1778&#150;1857), bishop of Aberdeen, Terrot was elected primus of the Scottish Episcopal church. As primus he found it difficult to sympathize with the former non-juring tradition in Scottish Episcopacy, preferring the southern high-church tradition that looked to the Church of England. But he was a force for unity when the tensions between the Anglicizing and the formerly non-juring traditions of Scottish Episcopalianism, together with Anglo-Catholicism, erupted in controversies over the eucharist and the Scottish communion office in the late 1850s and 1860s. In 1859 he married a widow, Charlotte Madden (<i>d</i>. 1862). Terrot remained primus until a paralytic stroke compelled his resignation in 1862. An excellent mathematician, he was for fourteen years a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was also a member of the Architectural Society of Scotland. Besides numerous charges and sermons, Terrot edited the Greek text of the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, with an introduction, paraphrase, and notes (published 1828), and translated the Lutheran Johann Ernesti's <span class="italic">Institutio interpretis novi testamenti</span> (1761) in two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Principles of Biblical Interpretation</span> (1832&#150;3). Terrot died on 2 April 1872 at Edinburgh, and was buried in the city's Calton cemetery.<br>
