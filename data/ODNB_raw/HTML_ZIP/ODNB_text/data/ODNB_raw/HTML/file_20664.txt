<span class="headword">Okeover <span class="st"> [Oker]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1595?, <em>d.</em> 1663?), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was probably the John Oker baptized at St Michael's, Worcester, on 7 October 1595, son of John Oker (<i>d</i>. 1620), a local builder, and his wife, Anne. Treasurer's accounts at Worcester Cathedral for 1611 refer to a John Oker as a senior chorister (a treble), though accounts for immediately following years relegate him to the bottom of the ranks, presumably owing to the breaking of his treble voice. Such a state of affairs would be entirely commensurate with a boy born about 1595, and the Worcester treble may well be synonymous with the St Michael's John Oker. If so, he would have received his musical instruction from Thomas Tomkins, organist and master of the choristers at Worcester from 1597. Recent researches into property records in Gloucester and Wells spanning the period 1627&#150;1660 have raised the distinct possibility that there were two (or even three) related composers named John Okeover, the first of whom would have died at Wells about 1640  (Scrase); if this is true the Gloucester Okeover may have been that composer's son.<br>
<br>When his father died on 3 January 1620, Okeover&#151;then aged twenty-five&#151;did not inherit his business, which was bequeathed jointly to the widow and an elder brother, Samuel, a fact that perhaps suggests that by this date John had moved elsewhere to pursue a career in music. This may be confirmed by a carving of 1616 in the wall of the organ loft at Winchester College, which notes that &#145;M IO. OKER&#146;, or John Oker, was organist, and an entry in the papers of William, second Lord Petre, of Ingatestone Hall, Essex, which describes music books &#145;all of which were placed in the charge of John Oker June 1616 with a chest of vialls&#146;  (Essex RO, MS D/DP.E.2/8). If these refer to the composer, then he had already gained valuable experience prior to taking up the position of vicar-choral and organist at Wells Cathedral (in succession to Richard Browne) on 16 February 1620.<br>
<br>In 1625 Okeover was made master of the choristers at Wells, thereafter performing occasional duties as receiver, senior, and escheator. His relationship with the dean and chapter later deteriorated owing to differences of opinion regarding the precise application of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in choral services. According to Anthony Wood, Okeover graduated BMus from New College, Oxford, on 5 July 1633. By about this time he appears to have married Elizabeth, daughter of John Beaumont, a member of a well-known family in Wells, who left legacies to his daughter and to Okeover in his will of 5 March 1634. From the mid-1630s he evidently developed links with Gloucester Cathedral, where he became organist and master of the choristers in 1640.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Okeover returned to Wells. The account books there contain no references to him after 1663, in which year he probably died. His surviving compositions include a handful of anthems (of which only one is complete) and nineteen pieces for viols in three and five parts. The geographical spread of the manuscript sources of his compositions suggests that Okeover's reputation was local rather than national, though he was nevertheless a competent practitioner of his craft.<br>
