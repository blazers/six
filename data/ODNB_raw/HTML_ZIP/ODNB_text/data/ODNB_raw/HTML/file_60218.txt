<span class="headword">Taylor,  Rachel  Annand</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rachel Annand]</span>  (1876&#150;1960), <span class="occ">poet and literary scholar</span>, was born on 3 April 1876 at 51 Queen Street, Aberdeen, the second of the five children of John Wilson Annand, mason and socialist pioneer, and Clarinda Dinnie of the Deeside highlands. She was influenced by her father's passionate intellect and her mother's knowledge of highland mythology. She had a robust &#145;disregard for the more bourgeois virtues of prudence and respectability&#146;  (Grierson, 153) and her awareness of the effects of poverty mingled with pride in what could be achieved under its constraints is evident in one of her most often anthologized poems, &#145;The Princess of Scotland&#146;.<br>
<br>Rachel Annand trained as a teacher at Aberdeen Training Centre (1894&#150;7), where she was eligible to attend university classes. Although she did not graduate, she was one of the first women to take arts classes after the admission of women to the university, and in 1943 was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by Aberdeen University. She studied philosophy and English literature with Herbert J. C. Grierson, who remembered her as &#145;a young woman with a startling shock of red hair whom, when an essay came to be read, I placed alone in the first class&#146;  (Grierson, 152). She continued to excel in her studies and some early poetry was published in the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>. Rachel Annand taught at the High School for Girls in Aberdeen before marrying Alexander Cameron Taylor (1875&#150;1943), an Aberdeen graduate, on 15 July 1901. Alexander Taylor was a classics teacher in Dundee, where the couple settled at 9 Balgon Avenue.<br>
<br>Taylor's first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, which clearly demonstrates her links with aestheticism, was published in 1904. Sir Patrick Geddes, with whom Taylor became acquainted in Dundee, raised a subscription to bring out her second collection, <span class="italic">Rose and Vine</span> (1909). She wrote two further volumes, <span class="italic">The Hours of Fiammetta</span> (1910), a sonnet sequence, and <span class="italic">The End of Fiammetta</span> (1923). Fiammetta, the muse of Boccaccio, is used as a symbol of the feminine &#145;behind all the processes of art&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hours of Fiammetta</span>, preface).<br>
<br>When her husband's mental health collapsed and he was institutionalized, Taylor embarked on a precarious writing career in London, describing the trauma of the previous period to Geddes as, &#145;the dim nightmare called Dundee&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 10572, fol. 25). Her niece, the Glasgow artist Louise Annand, believes Taylor supported herself by reviewing. She stayed at 17 Jenner House, Hunter's Street, Bloomsbury, within easy reach of the British Museum reading room, where she conducted research into medieval and Renaissance literature. At the request of Gilbert Murray, Taylor produced <span class="italic">Aspects of the Italian Renaissance</span> (1923) which, together with <span class="italic">Leonardo the Florentine</span> (1927), contained &#145;a vividly imaginative interpretation and recreation of the picturesque past&#146; bringing the aims of Pater, Symonds, and Wilde to their apotheosis  (Aldington, 6). Taylor's scholarly work, though largely disregarded by subsequent commentators, also contains evidence of attitudes towards contemporary cultural debates. Her chapter &#145;Women of the Renaissance&#146; in <span class="italic">Aspects</span> is an important early twentieth-century reflection on the significance of female gender. This theme is revisited in the preface to <span class="italic">Hours</span>, where she describes herself as &#145;equally inimical &hellip; to the opposing camps of hausfrau and suffragist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hours</span>, 5&#150;6); and in <span class="italic">The End of Fiammetta</span>, where Taylor writes regretfully about not having had children because of her devotion to writing  (<span class="italic">End</span>, 100&#150;01).<br>
<br>Taylor's poetic style was criticized by C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) because its aesthetic embellishment and non-Scottish focus was, by his modernist analysis, merely effete, &#145;It is mostly very preciose, very far-fetched, very mannered, very unreal&#146;  (MacDiarmid, 326). In 1931 Taylor published a monograph, <span class="italic">Dunbar: the Poet and his Period</span> (1931) on the medieval poet, her contribution to the renewed interest in Scottish literature encapsulated in MacDiarmid's phrase &#145;Not Burns, Dunbar!&#146;<br>
<br>Louise Annand remembers her aunt as a somewhat &#145;formidable&#146; woman whose &#145;dress could only be described as &#147;Celtic&#148;!&#146;  (Forrest, 28). Towards the end of 1959 Taylor sustained a fall in her home. She died of non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver and heart failure on 15 August 1960 at the Elizabeth Garrett Hospital, St Pancras, London, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 18 August.<br>
