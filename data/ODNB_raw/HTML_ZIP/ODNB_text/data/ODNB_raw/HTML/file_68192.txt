<span class="headword">Bird, Sir  William</span>  (1560/61&#150;1624), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the second son of William Bird, gentleman, of Saffron Walden, Essex, and Maria, daughter of John Woodhall, also of Walden; Bird was born in Walden. He matriculated at All Souls College, Oxford, on 28 November 1581, aged twenty, having become a fellow in 1578. He devoted himself to the study of the civil law, receiving the degrees of BCL in 1583 and DCL in 1588. He was admitted as an advocate of the arches on 27 April 1589 and became a member of Doctors' Commons on 14 October 1590. His early career was spent mainly at Oxford, where he became acting vice-chancellor of the university in 1591 and dean of All Souls in 1593. In 1597 he became more active in the London courts, especially the court of admiralty, where he practised until 1615, and the court of delegates, where he served frequently until 1622. In 1604 he resigned his fellowship at All Souls and took up residence at Doctors' Commons. In 1608 he succeeded Thomas Crompton DCL as MP for the University of Oxford. Bird represented the civil lawyers at the conference with the common law judges concerning prohibitions in 1611, and in the same year he was appointed judge of the prerogative court of Canterbury, together with Sir John Bennet. Bird succeeded to that post by himself in 1622, after Bennet was prosecuted for corruption. In 1615 Bird defended Samuel Pallachia against a &pound;3000 suit brought by the count of Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador. Bird claimed that his client, who had been accused of being an impostor, was a public minister of the king of Barbary and deserved the same respect as the Spanish ambassador. In 1617 he and Sir Edward Conway were sent to survey Jersey, hold a general muster, and inquire into the abuses and defects of its martial and civil government. They also reported on ecclesiastical government, indicating that the ministers of the twelve parishes on the island, which followed the form and discipline of the Reformed churches of France, were ready for conformity with England. The laity, however, according to Bird and Conway, feared the assertion of ecclesiastical authority and the formalities of a law unknown to them.<br>
<br>Bird was knighted on 22 March 1617. He reached the high point of his career with his appointment as dean of the court of arches on 23 June 1618. Like many civil lawyers, Bird also served as a master in chancery and in that capacity he and three others were accused in the parliament of 1621 of taking improper fees against the terms of the statute of 1 Jac. c. 10. Bird and his colleagues argued that the intent of the statute was not to deprive the masters of their fees. Bird's last judicial appointment was as a member of the high commission in 1620.<br>
<br>Bird held a house in Walthamstow, Essex, in the right of his wife, Jane, as well as the rectory of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire. Although he had been appointed JP for Essex in 1603, his service as master in chancery and judge of two of the courts of the archbishop of Canterbury allowed him to spend only a few weeks in the year in his home county. In 1623 he petitioned Conway, now secretary of state, for exemption from his duty to show his horse and armour at the county muster. Bird was buried on 5 September 1624 in Christ Church, Newgate, London. By the terms of a signed testament he bequeathed the lease of his house to his wife, who received a renewal of his grant to the rectory of Ickleton in November. He and his wife did not have any children.<br>
