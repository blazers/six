<span class="headword">Flint,  Frank Stuart</span>  (1885&#150;1960), <span class="occ">writer and civil servant</span>, was born on 19 December 1885 at 117 Barnsbury Road in Islington, London, one of several children of William Thomas Flint, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Hannah Alice Tricker. He grew up in a working-class area of London and attended local schools until the age of thirteen, when his family's financial circumstances forced him to seek a variety of unskilled jobs. A tall, gangly, bespectacled youth, he soon began a programme of independent reading, and through classes in typing and shorthand at a working men's night school qualified for a secretarial job in the civil service in 1904. His particular interests in poetry, history, and philosophy, however, combined with a gift for languages, encouraged him to move rapidly beyond his neighbourhood and class. His fluency in French and knowledge of European literature, coupled with his special focus on the French symbolist poets, placed him at the vanguard of early English modernism.<br>
<br>Flint began his career as a literary critic in 1908 writing articles and reviews in A. R. Orage's <span class="italic">New Age</span>. Through his work for this journal, and later for <span class="italic">The Egoist</span> and for Harriet Monroe's <span class="italic">Poetry</span> in Chicago, he introduced British and then American readers to a range of new avant-garde writers, among them the French author R&eacute;my de Gourmont and the Belgian poet Emile Verhaeren. He also initiated at this time important correspondences with a myriad of younger writers publishing in Paris in the <span class="italic">Mercure de France</span> and the <span class="italic">Nouvelle Revue Fran&ccedil;aise</span>, among them Vildrac, Romains, Duhamel, Fort, and the Italian futurist Marinetti. He began to publish his own verse in Ford Madox Hueffer's <span class="italic">English Review</span> in 1909. On 20 November of that year he married Violet Maude Fisher (1883/4&#150;1920), daughter of John Fisher, a school attendance officer, and published his first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">In the Net of Stars</span>, which featured both conventional love lyrics and experimental free verse, often on urban subjects and influenced by the poetic theories he was developing in the weekly conversations of the informal poetry club which included T. E. Hulme, Frances Tancred, Florence Farr, Edward Storer, and occasionally Ezra Pound.<br>
<br>Flint's reputation as an authority on modern French literature led in 1912 to his influential essay &#145;Contemporary French poetry&#146; for a special issue of Harold Monro's <span class="italic">Poetry Review</span>. Here he described several schools of post-symbolist writing and emphasized both the importance of free verse as a prosodic mode and the image as a vital element in perception and literary expression. In 1913 he joined Hulme in a second, more formal poetry club and continued to publicize French verse in his column, &#145;French chronicle&#146;, in <span class="italic">Poetry and Drama</span>. He was also a member of Pound's circle of promising young writers, becoming particularly close friends with Richard Aldington and Hilda Doolittle (H. D.) and championing their new literary movement, imagism, in which he participated.<br>
<br>Flint contributed poems to Pound's anthology <span class="italic">Des imagistes</span> (1914) as well as to the three subsequent imagist anthologies edited by Richard Aldington and Amy Lowell (1915&#150;17). In 1915 he published his second book of poems, <span class="italic">Cadences</span>, in which he experimented further with free verse, exploring the tensions between the beautiful and the squalid in modern life. The First World War interrupted his literary career, however, as many of his contemporaries entered the military, while his socialist sympathies were sharpened by the unrest both at home and abroad. His family obligations, which by this time included two children, Ianthe (<i>b</i>. 1911) and Oliver (<i>b</i>. 1914), pressed heavily upon him, and he clung to his civil service position, now in the Post Office, until conscripted in 1918. He served in the army for eleven months in primarily clerical capacities, remaining in home service, until demobilized in 1919. His most intimate friend during this period was Richard Aldington, who dedicated his poem &#145;The Walk&#146; (1920) to Flint, revealing a deep affection echoed by Flint in his third and last book of verse, <span class="italic">Otherworld</span> (1920), in which he addressed the title-poem as well as &#145;Soldiers&#146; &#145;To R. A.&#146;.<br>
<br>When Flint's wife died in childbirth in 1920, he was devastated. Desperate for help in caring for his children, he married Violet's sister Ruth Ellen Fisher (<i>b</i>. 1884/5) within a few months, on 18 August 1920, a domestic arrangement which ended in their divorce in 1928, several years after they had ceased to live together. He became increasingly involved with socialist causes and with his new post in the overseas section of the statistics division of the Ministry of Labour. His influence on literary modernism consequently diminished. Unlike his fellow imagists he chose finally not to be a poet: he continued to translate (from French, German, and Russian) throughout the 1920s and wrote literary essays, notably for T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Criterion</span>, into the early 1930s, but his subjects grew increasingly topical as his early translation of literary works gave way to books about current events and general biography. His position as an authority on French literature passed to Aldington, and by the late 1920s he had turned his attention primarily to popular German non-fiction, which he translated with D. F. Tait, including Ren&eacute; Fueloep-Miller's <span class="italic">Lenin und Gandhi</span> (as <span class="italic">Lenin and Gandhi</span>, 1927), <span class="italic">Die heilige Teufel: Rasputin und die Frauen</span> (as <span class="italic">Rasputin: the Holy Devil</span>, 1928), and <span class="italic">Macht und Geheimnis der Jesuiten</span> (as <span class="italic">The Power of the Jesuits</span>, 1930), and Arthur Polzer-Hoditz's <span class="italic">Kaiser Karl</span> (as <span class="italic">The Emperor Karl</span>, 1930). He concluded his writing career with two privately printed pamphlets: <span class="italic">Economic Equilibrium</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Paying for War and Peace</span> (1948).<br>
<br>When Flint retired from the civil service in 1951, as chief of the overseas section of the Ministry of Labour's statistics divison, he was made a companion of the Imperial Service Order. For the last years of his life, a burly and often cranky man with thick white hair, he lived in quiet isolation first in Highbury, London, then at West View, Harwell, Berkshire, where he died of a stroke on 28 February 1960; he was later cremated.<br>
