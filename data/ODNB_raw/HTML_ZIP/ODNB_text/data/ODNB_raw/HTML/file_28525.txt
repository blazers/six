<span class="headword">Wall,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1776), <span class="occ">physician and a founder of the Worcester Porcelain Company</span>, was baptized on 12 October 1708 at St Peter and St Lawrence Church, Powick, Worcestershire, the second child of John Wall (1662&#150;1734), a Worcester grocer, and his second wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cleve (1678&#150;1722). Following his father's bankruptcy, he was educated at King's School, Worcester, until June 1726, when he gained a Cookes scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford; he obtained a BA in 1730. He moved to Merton College, where he was elected a fellow in 1734 and became MA and BM in 1736; he took his MD in 1759. By July 1736, however, he had left Oxford and begun practice in Worcester. In 1740 he married Catherine (<i>bap</i>. 1709, <i>d</i>. 1797?), the daughter of Martin Sandys, town clerk of Worcester and cousin of Samuel Sandys, first Baron Sandys of Ombersley. They lived in Foregate Street, Worcester, where Wall had built a house, with their five children, one of whom died young; their two sons, John Wall and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28527/', "Martin Wall")</script>, both became physicians.<br>
<br>Wall's medical practice was said to consist of three-quarters of the city and much of the surrounding countryside; his patients included Lord Dudley at Halesowen Grange, the Lytteltons at Hagley Hall, and Lady Luxborough at Barrells, Warwickshire. Wall actively supported the efforts of the bishop, Isaac Maddox, to establish an infirmary at Worcester in 1745; he served as its first treasurer and was one of the four honorary physicians there until his death; he was also on the building committee for the new hospital in 1766. A regular subscriber, he left the hospital a legacy of &pound;20 in 1776; his widow bequeathed &pound;100 in 1797. His influence beyond the city was felt through his work as a steward of the Three Choirs festival and in 1757 through his promotion of a scheme to build accommodation at Malvern Wells for visiting patients. Politically, he was a whig.<br>
<br>Wall published quite widely, often on controversial topics. His first essay was on the local typhus epidemic of 1740&#150;42. He wrote on the uses of musk as a medication in 1744; on the efficacy of bark in smallpox, in 1747, claiming that Richard Mead had not given him credit for his therapy; on the &#145;putrid&#146; sore throat in 1751; and on the rinderpest epidemic then raging among cattle. He described treatment for worms in children, in 1758, and wrote about inoculation (1764), lead-poisoning from cider (1768), and angina pectoris (1775). His son Martin published a collection of these writings under the title <span class="italic">Medical Tracts</span>, in 1780. Wall's interest in hydrotherapy, which began in 1743, centred on the waters at nearby Malvern Wells. His monograph, <span class="italic">Experiments and Observations on the Malvern Waters</span> (1756, with enlarged editions in 1757 and 1763), helped to make the spa fashionable.<br>
<br>Apart from his medical interests, John Wall was a co-founder, with William Baylies and Edward Cave, of the Worcester Porcelain Company, in 1751. He was also one of the original fifteen shareholders. Wall was credited with inventing a new process for the manufacture of Worcester porcelain and the years 1751&#150;76 are known as the Wall period. An amateur artist, his earliest published etching was in 1736, though most of his work cannot now be traced. He produced frontispieces to three contemporary volumes, as well as some twelve classical and religious scenes, five of which were later hung in the museum of Worcester Porcelain and one in the Worcester city museum. In 1773 and 1774 he exhibited at the Royal Academy. Wall was also interested in glass painting, and about 1750 he designed the windows for the rebuilt Hartlebury Castle chapel; these were largely removed in 1898. In 1767 he designed an east window for Oriel College chapel, Oxford, which was executed by William Peckitt of York.<br>
<br>John Wall reputedly suffered from gout and in 1774 he left Worcester for Bath; he died there on 27 June 1776 and was buried in the abbey. His white marble monument, with its coat of arms and fulsome verse, illustrates the two aspects of his life, the palette of an artist and the caduceus of a practitioner. In his will, prepared a month before his death, his wife and children were the chief beneficiaries; and bequests were made to four Bath practitioners. His paintings were divided among his children.<br>
