<span class="headword">Alderson, Sir  Edwin Alfred Hervey</span>  (1859&#150;1927), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Capel St Mary, Suffolk, on 8 April 1859, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Mott Alderson, of Poyle House, Ipswich, and his wife, Catherine Harriett Swainson. In 1876 he joined the Prince of Wales's Own Norfolk artillery militia, and in 1878 was gazetted to the 97th foot, later the Queen's Own Royal West Kent regiment, joining his unit in Halifax, Nova Scotia. After a short term there he went with the regiment to Gibraltar, then in 1881 to Natal. There he was detached for service with the mounted infantry at Laing's Nek, and it was with the mounted infantry that he was identified for much of his career. In 1882 he served with them in the Egyptian campaign, including at Qassasin (26 August and 9 September) and Tell al-Kebir (13 September). He took part in the Gordon relief expedition (1884&#150;5) with the mounted (camel) regiment. For saving a private from drowning in the Nile in 1885 he was awarded the bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society. Alderson married in 1886 Alice Mary, second daughter of the Revd Oswald P. Sergeant, vicar of Chesterton, Oxfordshire. They had one son, and Alice survived her husband.<br>
<br>In 1887 Alderson was appointed adjutant to the mounted infantry at Aldershot, having been promoted to captain in the previous year; he was given the same appointment in the Royal West Kent regiment in 1890, and retained it for four years. He passed out of the Staff College, Camberley, in 1895, and in 1896, with the substantive rank of major, went in command of the mounted infantry to Rhodesia, where he was prominent in defeating the Matabele (Ndebele) revolt (1896). He was then given command of all troops in Mashonaland, and received the brevet of lieutenant-colonel. He then served at Aldershot as deputy assistant adjutant-general and in command of the mounted infantry. In 1900 he was made brevet colonel and inspector-general of mounted infantry with the rank of brigadier-general. During the South African War he commanded the mounted infantry in 1901&#150;2, his force including Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and other colonial troops. He was mentioned in dispatches, subsequently receiving the CB (1900); he was also appointed successively aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria and to Edward VII. In 1903 he was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel, and for four years commanded the 2nd infantry brigade at Aldershot with the rank of brigadier-general. He was promoted major-general in 1907. From 1908 to 1912 in India he commanded the 6th (Poona) division.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Alderson was appointed (4 August) to command the 1st mounted division, all troops in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. In October, with the rank of lieutenant-general, he was given the command of the 1st Canadian division, which embarked for France in February 1915. The division fought at Neuve Chapelle (10&#150;13 March), second Ypres (22 April&#150;25 May), Festubert (15&#150;25 May), and second Givenchy (15&#150;16 June). In August the 2nd Canadian division arrived in France, and the two divisions became the Canadian army corps, with Alderson in command. A third division was added in January 1916, and in the following May, when Sir Julian Byng took over the command, Alderson became inspector-general, Canadian forces, and held that appointment until the end of hostilities. He was promoted KCB in 1916. In 1921 he was made colonel of the Royal West Kent regiment.<br>
<br>Alderson retired in 1920, and devoted himself to his two main recreations, hunting and yachting. A noted horseman, and a great believer in hunting as training for officers, he wrote <span class="italic">Pink and Scarlet, or, Hunting as a School for Soldiering</span> (1900); wherever he was stationed he hunted. He owned several racing and other craft, and was commodore of the Broads Cruising Association. He published several other books, among them <span class="italic">With the Mounted Infantry and Mashonaland Field Force, 1896</span> (1898). Alderson died at the Royal Hotel, Lowestoft, on 14 December 1927, and was buried three days later in Chesterton.<br>
