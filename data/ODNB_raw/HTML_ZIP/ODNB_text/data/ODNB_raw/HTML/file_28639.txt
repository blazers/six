<span class="headword">Walter,  Lucy</span>  (1630?&#150;1658), <span class="occ">mother of James, duke of Monmouth</span>, was the daughter of William Walter (<i>d</i>. 1650) of Roch Castle, near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, and Elizabeth Prothero (<i>d</i>. 1652), daughter of John Prothero and niece of John Vaughan, first earl of Carbery. For about a year in 1648&#150;9 Lucy was the mistress of the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, subsequently <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script>, and Charles was the acknowledged father of the boy born to Lucy on 9 April 1649. Christened James [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24879/', "Scott, James")</script>], the child was the first of Charles II's many bastards, and was created duke of Monmouth in 1663. He became important politically in the 1670s and 1680s because of suggestions not only that he was the son of Charles II, but that he was also the legitimate son. During the exclusion crisis of 1679&#150;82, and during the rebellion which Monmouth subsequently led against James II in 1685, a central political question was whether or not his mother had gone through a form of marriage with his father, Charles, in the course of their relationship in 1648&#150;9. While most of the political nation was rightly sceptical (and Charles himself maintained absolutely that there had been no marriage), Lucy was by then dead, and there was just sufficient confusion over exactly what had taken place over thirty years earlier, and sufficient people with an interest in asserting that Monmouth was legitimate, for the story of a marriage to enjoy a scrap of credibility. The supposed marriage was critical, because if it had taken place, Monmouth was legitimate and thus, as the king's eldest son, was the heir to the throne. During the exclusion crisis this offered the whigs the easiest way of excluding the duke of York from the throne, while in 1685 it legitimized those who took up arms for Monmouth against James II. For these reasons Lucy Walter's short life is important as it explains why most of the political nation considered that a marriage between her and Charles was highly unlikely, but shows too that there were some straws available for the pro-marriage party to make use of.<br>
<br>Lucy Walter was born at Roch Castle, Pembrokeshire. Her parents were middling Welsh gentry (her mother brought a dowry of &pound;600 to her marriage), and though formally uneducated Lucy received the social manners which enabled her to mix with good society. This became important when, in 1640, her parents separated, her father remaining at Roch Castle while Lucy went with her mother to grow up in the cosmopolitan society of civil war London. At the end of the war she was briefly the mistress of the parliamentarian officer Algernon Sidney (1623&#150;1683), who, according to James II, bought her services for 40 gold pieces. When, however, he was ordered away with his regiment, Lucy decided to seek a new lover where young aristocrats were thickest to be found, and took ship to join the exiled royalist camp in the Netherlands. Here she made herself known to the younger and royalist brother of her former lover, Robert Sidney (1626&#150;1668). His time with her was brief, however, for in May 1648 part of the parliamentarian fleet mutinied and sailed to the royalists in Holland. This brought Prince Charles hurrying from France to inspect his new prize, and in a hectic week Lucy used her connections to meet, charm, and seduce the heir to the throne. Both were then just eighteen. She remained with him until September 1649, when he left for Jersey and thence to Scotland the following year. During this time John Evelyn remembered her as a &#145;browne, beautiful bold but insipid creature&#146;  (Evelyn, 2.561&#150;2), and even James II conceded that she was &#145;very handsome, [though] of little wit, and some cunning&#146;  (MacPherson, 1.76).<br>
<br>While Charles pursued his expedition to Scotland and England in 1650&#150;1, Lucy Walter supported herself and her young son in the only way she could, taking as her protector Theobald, second Viscount Taafe, with whom she had a daughter, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1651). When Charles returned to exile in 1652, he made it clear that their relationship was finished, but Lucy refused to accept this, and for the next four years created so many scandalous scenes that in 1656 she was given some money and a pearl necklace and shipped with her children back to England. Incapable of living quietly, she soon attracted the attention of the government, and was imprisoned in the Tower. Deciding that not even the royalists could be using her as a spy, the republic sent her back to Flanders, while its propaganda sheet made capital out of this woman &#145;who passed for Charles Stuart's wife&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>). Back in Brussels Lucy resumed her stormy ways, now using her growing son as a means of leverage against Charles and his advisers. After an attempt to kidnap the boy had resulted in a public fiasco, she was persuaded in March 1658 to give him up to a tutor named by Charles. By then she had contracted venereal disease, and after making a general confession to John Cosin (later bishop of Durham), she died in Paris towards the end of 1658 at the age of twenty-eight and was buried there.<br>
<br>Although the details of Lucy Walter's short relationship with Charles in 1648&#150;9, together with the whole tenor of her life, made the notion of a marriage between the two highly implausible, Lucy's general confession of her life to Cosin became the basis for the most circumstantial of the marriage stories. It was suggested that, in this confession, Lucy not only swore that a marriage had taken place, but entrusted Cosin with documentary proof, which was kept in a &#145;black box&#146;. Cosin's death in 1671 then left no direct witnesses when, in the 1670s, the enemies of James, duke of York, resurrected the Cosin story, and began a fruitless search for the &#145;black box&#146;. Supporting evidence they uncovered amounted to nothing more than memories that in the 1650s Lucy had insisted that she was no mere mistress but a wife. The political nation remained unconvinced of Monmouth's legitimacy, although in 1679 Charles went to the length of formally denying, at the privy council, that he had ever been married to Lucy Walter. Lucy Walter's name is sometimes misspelt as Mrs Walters or Waters and during her life abroad she adopted the alias of Mrs Barlow or Barlo.<br>
