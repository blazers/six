<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ecclestone,  Alan</span>  (1904&#150;1992), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and communist activist</span>, was born on 3 June 1904 at 233 Princes Road, Stoke-on-Trent, the second of the two children of George Henry Ecclestone (1867&#150;1942), a pottery designer, and his wife, Emily Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heath (1872&#150;1945). A scholarship to Newcastle high school set him on the road to Cambridge, while his English teacher introduced him to the Catholic Crusade, a radical form of Christian socialism headed by Conrad Noel. At St Catharine's, Cambridge, to which he went in 1922, he read history and English, gaining brilliant firsts in both in 1925. After a year's schoolteaching he was offered a lectureship in English at Durham, where he taught from 1927 to 1930. At the same time he began teaching courses for the Workers' Educational Association, a commitment he kept up for the rest of his working life. A desire to change rather than simply interpret events led him to leave university life and seek Anglican ordination. He trained at Wells&#151;an experience, he later said, designed to break one's spirit. He served a two-year curacy in Carlisle before moving to Barrow in 1934. On 17 July of the same year he married Delia Abraham (1902&#150;1982), the youngest and most radical of the children of C. T. Abraham, the bishop of Derby. Delia, a teacher, shared both her husband's faith and his politics. A stormy but completely committed relationship was at the heart of much of Ecclestone's later thought on prayer. The couple had three children.<br>
<br>In 1936 Ecclestone obtained his first living in Frizington, a Cumberland mining village where unemployment was high and poverty severe. Here he began to develop Catholic Crusade ideas, attempting to reorient church life around a weekly meeting where every facet of human life was up for discussion. Through a networking leaflet called <span class="italic">The Leap</span> he sought to extend this idea throughout the area. These activities brought him to the attention of the bishop of Sheffield, Lesley Hunter, who asked him to come to Darnall, an inner city parish in the heart of the Sheffield steelmaking district. Ecclestone moved there in 1942, and stayed there for the rest of his working life, until 1969. Here he at once began what was by now called the &#145;parish meeting&#146;. Politics, both national and local, were always high on the agenda, but so were art, literature, history, and theology.<br>
<br>Although initially a supporter of the Attlee government of 1945, Ecclestone soon felt that it had reneged on its election commitments and had ceased to be socialist. He therefore joined the Communist Party in April 1948, followed by Delia two weeks later. The two remained faithful party members throughout the traumas caused by the invasions of Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968). Ecclestone became a well-known party speaker and campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the Soviet-inspired Peace Conference. His activity here was instrumental in the choice of Sheffield as the venue for the second World Peace Conference in 1950, opened by a speech from Picasso. The hostility of the Labour government led to the refusal of visas for many delegates, including Shostakovich, Pablo Neruda, and Paul Robeson, and the conference shifted, after three days, to Warsaw, with Ecclestone in train. In 1955 he headed a delegation to Tashkent and in the 1960s he stood six times as Communist candidate for Darnall ward, losing his deposit each time. This activity scandalized even progressive bishops such as George Bell and made promotion, and even a change of parish, impossible. For most church people his stand seemed morally grotesque. Ecclestone always insisted, however, that the church was guilty of crimes equally as great as those of the party, and believed that commitment to a person, place, calling, or principle should not be lightly revoked. In the late 1960s he was a prominent member of the Christian Marxist dialogue then taking place throughout Europe. When he finally left the party, he almost instantly regretted his decision.<br>
<br>Throughout his years in Sheffield, Ecclestone continued to teach for the Workers' Educational Association, mostly in English and history, and no class ever failed. In the parish he was an innovator liturgically, anticipating many later developments in his services for marriage, baptism, and the eucharist. After retirement in 1969 he settled down to write, and the first of his major books, <span class="italic">Yes to God</span> (1975), won the Collins religious book prize. The book put the concept of prayer onto a completely new footing, understanding it as part of the fabric of human response to sexuality, art, literature, and politics. It was one of the truly creative works of spirituality of the twentieth century. None of the later books had the same success, although <span class="italic">The Night Sky of the Lord</span> (1980), a book about Christian responses to the holocaust, won appreciation especially from the Jewish community. These books and his earlier reputation made him a much sought-after speaker at retreats and conferences.<br>
<br>Delia died after a long illness in 1982. Ecclestone's home at Gosforth, Cumberland, remained a place of pilgrimage for students and seekers of all kinds; there they were met with a mixture of warm hospitality and relentless questioning. He died in London on 14 December 1992 after a series of strokes, and was buried in Gosforth on the 19th. As the primary exemplar of the union of <i>mystique</i> and <i>politique</i> in twentieth-century Anglicanism he remains a seminal figure, but it is likely that he will be remembered chiefly for his work on prayer.<br>
