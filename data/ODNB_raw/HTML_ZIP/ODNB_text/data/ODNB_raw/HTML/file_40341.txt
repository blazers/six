<span class="headword">McMillan,  Roderick Macaulay <span class="st"> [Roddy]</span></span>  (1923&#150;1979), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born on 23 March 1923 in the Anderston district of Glasgow, the second of the two children of Duncan McMillan (1880&#150;1964), a foreman docker, and Rachel Macaulay (1879&#150;1935). Roddy McMillan was born into a Gaelic-speaking family&#151;his father came from Ardnamurchan in Argyll and his mother from the Isle of Harris&#151;and the highland inheritance informed much of his work as an actor and playwright. Religion proved to be unimportant for him despite his strictly Presbyterian upbringing. He was educated at Finnieston public school, Glasgow, leaving at the age of fourteen. The only early sign of performance talent was in playing drums with the Boys' Brigade.<br>
<br>Between 1938 and 1945 McMillan worked briefly as a delivery van boy for a biscuit factory but was soon apprenticed to a glass beveller and lens grinder. He subsequently attended night school as part of his training in the Rolls-Royce aero-engineering factory. By 1941 McMillan was taking an interest in amateur acting and, encouraged by the actor Duncan Macrae who had taught him at Finnieston, he joined Glasgow Unity Theatre. He married Jean Alexander Bell (1923&#150;1996) in December 1943; their first daughter, Sine, was born in 1944 and their second, Norma, in 1947.<br>
<br>Unity turned professional in 1946. McMillan decided to stay with them to follow a theatrical career, making his London d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The Gorbals Story</span> in February 1948. When Unity broke up, James Bridie was instrumental in McMillan's joining the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre Company in 1950.<br>
<br>McMillan soon established himself as a character actor of considerable stature, with a distinct gift for comedy. His style, described by David Hutchison as &#145;contemporary urban naturalism&#146;  (Hutchison, 5), was clearly the legacy of Unity's repertoire of Russian classics and social realism. McMillan was a regular member of the Citizens' until 1956, acting in a wide range of plays from Shakespeare to new Scottish writers, from J. Bridie and J. B. Priestley to Christmas pantomimes.<br>
<br>However, it was as a playwright that McMillan saw his future. His first play <span class="italic">All in Good Faith</span>, initially rejected by the Citizens', was eventually produced by them in 1954. The reviews were harshly critical, claiming that it presented an unrealistic picture of contemporary life. McMillan was disillusioned and it was nineteen years before he wrote his second play. Nevertheless the play illustrates his particular gift in utilizing the Scots dialect to communicate with an audience.<br>
<br>With the gradual decline of repertory theatre McMillan moved successfully into television, where he worked regularly from 1959. He was best known in the title role in <span class="italic">The View from Daniel Pike</span> (1971), as Para Handy in <span class="italic">The Vital Spark</span> series (1974), and as Choc Minty in <span class="italic">Hazell</span> (1978). He also enjoyed credits as a supporting actor in films such as <span class="italic">Morning Departure</span> (1950), <span class="italic">The Battle of the Sexes</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">Ring of Bright Water</span> (1969).<br>
<br>It was not until the early 1970s, however, that McMillan really emerged as a leading figure on the Scottish stage when, in an attempt to revive interest in new Scottish drama, Bill Bryden formed a company of leading Scottish actors at Edinburgh's Lyceum Theatre. McMillan played Jake in Bryden's <span class="italic">Willie Rough</span> (1971) and then, encouraged by Bryden, he wrote <span class="italic">The Bevellers</span>. The Lyceum's production (1973) was instantly successful with McMillan playing Bob Darnley. This play became a significant influence on a generation of new Scottish playwrights.<br>
<br>Throughout his life McMillan was keenly interested in Scottish ballads and folk music. He composed and published many songs, including &#145;Campbeltown Loch&#146;. Theatre was not only his profession but also his private passion. He was on the board of the Duncan Macrae Memorial Trust and between 1953 and 1968 he was an active committee member of Scottish Actors Equity. His only recreation, apart from playwriting, was fly-fishing.<br>
<br>McMillan was a small, stockily built man with sandy coloured hair and a strong and charismatic personality. On his recovery from a period of alcoholism he devoted a considerable time to helping others with similar problems. A man of generous spirit in public and in private, with a pawky sense of humour, he was highly regarded by his colleagues. In 1972 he won a television personality award and in 1979 he became an OBE.<br>
<br>McMillan died suddenly, of a heart attack, at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 9 July 1979. He was cremated on 12 July at Linn crematorium in Glasgow. In 1982 a new variety of rose, the &#145;Roddy McMillan&#146;, commissioned as a memorial by his friends and colleagues, was introduced at the Chelsea Flower Show.<br>
