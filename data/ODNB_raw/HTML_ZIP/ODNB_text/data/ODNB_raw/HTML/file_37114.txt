<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  Robert Rowand</span>  (1834&#150;1921), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 5 April 1834 in Edinburgh, the younger son and third of the four children of James Anderson, a solicitor, and his wife, Margaret Rowand of Glasgow. Anderson studied at George Watson's Hospital, Edinburgh, from 1841 to 1848, before leaving to take up a legal apprenticeship for four years. This he abandoned in 1852, when he joined the office of Edinburgh architect John Lessels, and enrolled as a part-time student at the Trustees' School of Design, Edinburgh, that same year, under Alexander Christie. Here Anderson won a number of prizes for measured drawings of historic Scottish architecture. About 1854 he joined the Edinburgh office of the Royal Engineers, and in 1858&#150;9 he undertook a year-long tour of France and Italy. He returned to Edinburgh in 1859, resuming his architectural post at the Royal Engineers' office, where he rebuilt Broughty Castle, Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire (1860&#150;61).<br>
<br>On 23 July 1863 Anderson married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter of Henry Ross, farmer, of Kinnahaird, Ross-shire. They had one daughter, who died of typhoid in 1872 at the age of eight. In 1868 he left the Royal Engineers, published a book of drawings, dedicated to George Gilbert Scott, from his continental tour, and began independent practice. In the meantime he had designed a number of small Episcopal churches. His restoration of St Vigean's Church, Arbroath, Forfarshire (1871&#150;2), established his reputation as a restorer of taste, scholarliness, and principle. Later, there followed competition wins for the Catholic Apostolic Church, Edinburgh (1871&#150;3), Edinburgh school board schools (1874&#150;7), and Edinburgh University medical schools (1874&#150;86). In 1878 he was commissioned by John Stuart, third marquess of Bute, to rebuild Mount Stuart, near Rothesay, confirmation of his pre-eminent position in Scotland. Other large commissions followed, including the Central Hotel, Glasgow (1878&#150;84), the National Portrait Gallery and Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh (1884&#150;9), and the McEwan Hall at Edinburgh University (1884&#150;9).<br>
<br>These buildings, in a mixture of styles, bear all the hallmarks of Anderson's architectural approach: sound building, straightforward planning, and delicate, scholarly detailing. Believing that architectural beauty derived largely from functional and structural efficiency, Anderson constantly attacked the exponents of the Scottish Baronial style, and thus ushered in a new era of refinement in Scottish architecture. His restorations at Iona Abbey (1874&#150;6), Dunblane Cathedral (1889&#150;93), Paisley Abbey (1898&#150;1907), and Sweetheart Abbey, Dumfries (1911&#150;14), set standards of scholarliness and restraint for generations to come.<br>
<br>In 1893 Anderson founded the school of applied art in Edinburgh, to train architects and craftsmen. In 1895 he instituted the national art survey to record all pre-eighteenth-century buildings. This, together with some of Anderson's own buildings, inspired a widespread revival of the Scottish Renaissance style. One of the most notable exponents of this style was Sir Robert Stodart Lorimer, who had trained in Anderson's office from 1885 to 1889.<br>
<br>Unlike several of his famous pupils, such as J. J. Joass or Lorimer, Anderson deliberately restricted his practice to Scotland, and this has had a limiting effect on his reputation. He was, however, invited to submit designs, which were unsuccessful but widely admired, for the Imperial Institute, London (1887), the Queen Victoria memorial in the Mall (1901), and the British Museum extension (1904). He was awarded an LLD of Edinburgh University in 1884, was made an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1897, was knighted in 1902, and was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) gold medal (he was a fellow of the RIBA) in 1916. His final achievement was the creation of a central professional body, the Institute of Scottish Architects, in 1916. He became its first president. Anderson was typically Scottish in character: serious, practical, energetic, and remarkably forceful. Occasionally, in his latter years, his pride could be wounded. He died at his home, Allermuir House, Colinton, Edinburgh, on 1 June 1921 and was buried five days later at Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
