<span class="headword">Vesey,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>c.</em>1715&#150;1791), <span class="occ">literary hostess</span>, was probably born in Ireland. She was the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28259/', "Sir Thomas Vesey, bt")</script>, bishop of Ossory (1672/3&#150;1730), and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1746), daughter and heir of Denny Muschamp of Horsley, Surrey. The Veseys were an important Anglo-Irish family; Thomas's father, John, was archbishop of Tuam. Elizabeth was presumably educated at home; her correspondence suggests wide reading and at least some competence in French and Italian. She married William Handcock of Willbrook, co. Westmeath, before December 1731 when Mary Delany reported seeing them at a ball in Dublin. Handcock, who represented the borough of Fore in the Irish parliament, died in 1741. By early 1746 Elizabeth had married a wealthy cousin, Agmondesham Vesey (<i>d</i>. 1785) of Lucan, a member of the Irish parliament for Harristown, co. Kildare, and Kinsale, co. Cork. He also served as accountant-general of Ireland. Elizabeth had no children from either marriage.<br>
<br>The Veseys travelled frequently to England and by the 1760s their stays in Ireland were generally limited to the biennial meetings of parliament. In London they rented houses in Clarges Street and Bolton Row. In Ireland they lived at Lucan. Agmondesham Vesey, who fancied himself as an architect, improved his house there after his marriage, but between 1775 and 1777 he replaced it entirely with a correct Georgian mansion. Vesey was generally held to be an intellectual lightweight, always seeking to follow fashion. He was good company as a casual acquaintance but few valued his advice or friendship. He was also chronically unfaithful to his wife. Elizabeth Vesey maintained the fa&ccedil;ade of a successful marriage, nursed her husband during attacks of epilepsy, but depended for support upon a circle of female friends. Her domestic companion was a sister of her first husband. Miss Handcock (her first name is not known), who also assumed most of the duties of household management, was always acknowledged cordially by Vesey's correspondents, but she seems to have stayed in the background on social occasions. Vesey's well-known friends included Mary Delany, whom she met in Ireland, Margaret, duchess of Portland, Elizabeth Montagu, Elizabeth Carter, Frances Burney, and Hannah More.<br>
<br>Vesey and Montagu seem to have met in the late 1740s. By the 1760s they were very close, sharing friends of both sexes and co-operating in establishing a salon where intelligent talk and witty repartee were more important than drink, politics, cards, or sexual encounters. They referred to their circle as the bluestocking philosophers. Vesey seems to have introduced this use of the term bluestocking, applying it to both men and women. The philosophy was put into action most effectively in her drawing-room; Vesey's charm and gifts as a hostess made her salon the most memorable of the group. In 1783 young Mary Hamilton wrote that at the Vesey house:<blockquote>one meets with a charming variety of society &hellip; the Learned, the witty, the old &amp; young, the grave, gay, wise &amp; unwise, the fine bred Man &amp; the pert coxcomb; The elegant female, the chaste Matron, the severe prude, &amp; the pert Miss, but be it remembered that you can run no <i>risque</i> in Mrs. Vesey's parties of meeting with those who have no claim to respect. (Anson and Anson, 132)</blockquote>Hannah More's poem <span class="italic">Bas bleu</span> (1784) was written to commemorate such an assembly.<br>
<br>Vesey's success obviously depended on her personality. She was small in stature and retained her girlish beauty for many years. She seems to have been an incurable flirt, but her charm beguiled both men and women. Delany dubbed her Sylph, and her closest friends continued to call her that throughout her life. Like her friend Elizabeth Montagu she suffered from stomach complaints and other ills both real and imaginary. They frequently exchanged medications and medical advice. Vesey's surviving letters, found among those of her friends, reflect her restless flitting from one topic to another and her flights of fancy. They were treasured by such recipients as Elizabeth Carter who wrote that &#145;All your friends and correspondents receive the same delightful entertainment, and are equally charmed by your Letters, as they ever were; they breathe the same enchanting style which has ever marked what falls from your pen&#146;  (Pennington, 4.302). The modern reader, not knowing her in person, often finds Vesey's letters of less interest than those of other bluestockings. Despite her clerical forebears Vesey had no real religious convictions. This distressed many of her friends who believed her lack of belief made her more prey to the depression which afflicted her later years.<br>
<br>After 1782 the Vesey household did not return to Ireland. None of the principals was in good health, and by then Elizabeth Vesey feared she was losing both sight and hearing. Agmondesham Vesey died on 3 June 1785. His widow and her companion, Miss Handcock, were further distressed to find that neither was mentioned in his will. Their friends reported that Elizabeth had turned over all her funds to her husband at the time of their marriage; now all that remained was Vesey's jointure and Handcock's annuity which together brought in about &pound;800 a year. An added insult was the report that Agmondesham Vesey had left &pound;1000 to his mistress. Some financial help was given to Vesey and Handcock by various relatives and in 1788 they moved to the Chelsea house of Vesey's cousin, Lord Cremorne. After her husband's death Vesey gave way to a tearful depression for some months. She reappeared briefly in society in 1787&#150;8 but never again assumed the place she had previously held. Miss Handcock died in January 1789, leaving Vesey alone with her tears and her depression. She died in Chelsea early in 1791.<br>
<br>Any account of the bluestockings must include Vesey, although she is the most difficult to pin down. She left no literary remains, no mass of letters, and no autobiographical account. However, the brief success of the bluestocking philosophy probably owed more to her than to any of the other women usually identified with this group.<br>
