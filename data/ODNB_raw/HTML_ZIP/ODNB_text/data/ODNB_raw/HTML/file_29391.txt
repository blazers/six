<span class="headword">Wild,  Charles</span>  (1781&#150;1835), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in London. He was apprenticed to the draughtsman Thomas Malton the younger and, like his master, he specialized in architectural subjects. It was from Malton's house that Wild exhibited his first works, at the Royal Academy in 1803, two views of Christ Church, Oxford. In total he showed nine works at the academy but it was at the Society of Painters in Water Colours that he was to make his mark, exhibiting 165 architectural subjects between 1809 and 1833. These comprised internal and external views of the great English cathedrals and, after 1821, the churches, first of northern France and subsequently of Belgium and of Germany. Works such as <span class="italic">View in the East Transept of Worcester Cathedral</span> (exh. Society of Painters in Water Colours, 1823; V&amp;A) combine a close attention to architectural detail with an attractive picturesque treatment. Wild's work was generally well received by the critics, who appreciated his ambition to raise the status of the architectural subject. <span class="italic">A View in Canterbury Cathedral</span>, exhibited in 1810, included pilgrims and was accompanied by a quotation from Chaucer; <span class="italic">The Penance of Jane Shore, in the Old Cathedral of St Paul's</span> (exh. Society of Painters in Water Colours, 1827), a reconstruction from archaeological evidence, was accompanied in the exhibition catalogue by lines from Sir Thomas More. In addition to supporting the society's exhibitions Wild was its treasurer from 1823 to 1826, and its secretary from 1827 to 1831.<br>
<br>Wild's work as an engraver and publisher of architectural views earned him a place in the history of the Gothic revival. Beginning with <span class="italic">Twelve Perspective Views of the Exterior and Interior Parts of Canterbury</span>, in 1807, he produced a series of aquatints&#151;sometimes coloured&#151;of English cathedrals, which were praised for their accuracy. The Canterbury series was followed by York in 1809, Chester in 1813, Lichfield in 1813, Lincoln in 1819, and Worcester in 1823. Wild's travels on the continent also resulted in a number of publications, including <span class="italic">Twelve select examples of the ecclesiastical architecture of the middle ages, chiefly in France</span> (1826) and a series of etched outlines from <span class="italic">Architectural Sketches Made in Belgium, Germany and France</span> (1833). Wild was particularly adept at publicizing his publications and many of the original watercolours appeared at the society's exhibitions. Wild is perhaps best remembered, however, for his contribution to one of the most sumptuous publications in hand-coloured aquatint, William Henry Pyne's <span class="italic">History of the Royal Residences</span> (3 vols., 1819). He produced watercolours for fifty-eight of the hundred views, including large groups of Windsor Castle and Carlton House, some of which provide a unique record of lost interiors (Royal Collection). He also painted four highly detailed watercolours, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, for Whittaker and Nayler's <span class="italic">Coronation of George IV</span> (1821&#150;41).<br>
<br>Wild's career was seriously affected by failing eyesight after 1827, and he became blind in 1832. He died, on 4 August 1835, at 35 Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, where he had lived since 1820. Among his children with his wife, Margaret, was the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29393/', "James William Wild")</script>; his daughter Isabella Lucy married the architect, printer, and designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15066/', "Owen Jones (1809&#150;1874)")</script>.<br>
