<span class="headword">Warren,  Richard Augustus</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobite Sir Richard Warren, baronet]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1705&#150;1775), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was the son of John Warren of Corduff or Courtduffe, co. Dublin, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. The family were recusant gentry. One of three younger sons, two of whom, William and John, had joined Lally's Franco-Irish regiment in the French service, Richard Warren started in business as a merchant at Marseilles. On hearing of the preparations by Prince Charles, the Young Pretender, for an expedition to Scotland in 1744, he wound up his affairs and joined his brothers' regiment as a volunteer. On 10 August 1745 he was transferred as a captain without pay to Rothe's Franco-Irish infantry. In the middle of October he embarked for Scotland and landed at Stonehaven. He joined the prince at Edinburgh, became aide-de-camp to Lord George Murray, was made a colonel at Brampton on 12 November, and took part in the siege of Carlisle.<br>
<br>After the Young Pretender's retreat from Derby, Warren was sent to raise levies in Atholl, and he collected the fishing boats for the expedition by which Lord Loudoun's force of 1500 men, posted between the Moray and Dornoch firths, was surprised and dispersed. On 18 April 1746 he sailed from Findhorn with dispatches from the marquis d'&Eacute;guilles, the French envoy, urging reinforcements. He reached Versailles on the 30th, having been sent for the purpose of inflating the importance of the inconsequential Jacobite victory at the &#145;route of Moy&#146;, in March 1746. In gratitude for the news, and for the safe delivery of several prisoners captured at the battle, the French court awarded him the rank of colonel, and he was made a knight of the order of St Louis. Commissioned to rescue the prince, he embarked under great secrecy on 31 August at Cape Fr&eacute;hel on the frigate <i>Heureux</i> with another ship, the <i>Prince de Conti</i>, and arrived at Lochmanuagh, Inverness-shire, on 6 September 1746. After three weeks' search he took the Young Pretender on board, on 30 September at Lochmanuagh, and landed him on 10 October at Roscoff, in Brittany.<br>
<br>Warren had desired the French title of baron if he succeeded in his task. Instead, James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, made him a Jacobite baronet on 3 November 1746, but he was prohibited from publicly assuming that rank until 1751. He was aide-de-camp to Marshal Saxe until 1748, received the rank of brigadier-general from James Edward in 1750, and was advanced within the royal and military order of St Louis in 1755. He paid a visit to London in 1751 and was included on a list of proposed attainders for rebels in 1752. He had a French pension of 1200 livres, and in 1754 obtained a captaincy in Rothe's regiment. In 1762 he was made a <i>mar&eacute;chal-de-camp</i>, was naturalized in 1764, and was appointed commandant of Belle &Icirc;le, which post he held until his death on 21 June 1775. Unmarried, he left a will in favour of a young man named MacCarthy, but his debts exceeded the assets. His papers are preserved in the Morbihan archives at Vannes.<br>
