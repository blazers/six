<span class="headword">Wicksteed,  Charles</span>  (1810&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born in Shrewsbury on 10 June 1810, the seventh son and eighth child (of eleven) of John Wicksteed (1774&#150;1837), a starch manufacturer and, after business reverses, manager of a gasworks. Through his mother, Bithia Wicksteed (1775&#150;1819), daughter of John Swanwick of Wem, Shropshire, his descent could be traced from the great dissenting preacher Philip Henry (1631&#150;1707).<br>
<br>In 1818 Wicksteed entered Shrewsbury School, where in time he was admitted to the small group taught directly by the headmaster, Samuel Butler (1774&#150;1839). He thought Butler deficient in the humane side of scholarship, but the classical training was technically superior, and in 1828, assisted financially by the Shrewsbury Chapel and Dr Williams's trust, he entered the University of Glasgow, graduating BA in 1831.<br>
<br>In that year Wicksteed became minister of the Ancient Chapel, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, succeeding John Hamilton Thom (1810&#150;1894), who had moved to Renshaw Street Chapel in the city. In 1835 he became minister at Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds. In 1837 he married Jane Lupton (1815?&#150;1902), daughter of Arthur Lupton of the Leeds mercantile dynasty; they had five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38802/', "Philip Henry Wicksteed (1844&#150;1927)")</script>, and four daughters, one of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>The theological and literary collaboration forged in Liverpool with Thom, James Martineau (1805&#150;1900) of Paradise Street Chapel, and John James Tayler (1796&#150;1869) of Upper Brook Street Chapel, Manchester, reached its apogee in the joint editorship of the <span class="italic">Prospective Review</span> in 1845&#150;54, the influential voice of the &#145;new school&#146; of English Unitarianism, as against the older tradition of eighteenth-century Priestleyanism. Wicksteed published less and exercised a smaller role in the denomination than his friends. He was, however, an erudite and thoughtful man and a popular and important preacher: the &#145;joyous juvenility&#146; noted by Henry Crabb Robinson (1775&#150;1867) in his travel diary  (22 Oct 1849, DWL) may have been a more important portent of later Victorian pulpit style than the rigour and austerity that characterized the preaching of his colleagues in the quadrumvirate.<br>
<br>Wicksteed's health was delicate, and his outward joviality belied deep uncertainties, stemming in part from the loss of his brilliant and adored elder brother Joseph Hartley Wicksteed (<i>b</i>. 1803) in a swimming accident in Scotland in 1824. He retired from Leeds for ill health in 1854 and settled in north Wales, where from 1856 he operated a farm, Hafod-y-coed, in the Vale of Clywd. He attended the parish church&#151;but never the morning service, some parts of which Unitarians found offensive&#151;while impressing Unitarian principles on his children. In 1861&#150;3 he supplied the pulpit at Hope Street Church, Liverpool, and in the latter year began a joint ministry with Alexander Gordon (1841&#150;1931); on resigning in 1872 he was enabled by an annuity furnished by friends to become &#145;minister at large&#146;, lecturing around the country until 1881. He had given up the farm in 1875 and in 1877 moved to Croydon, where he died of a stroke on 19 April 1885. He was buried in Norwood cemetery, London.<br>
