<span class="headword">Spilman,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680, <em>d.</em> 1763), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was baptized at Yarmouth on 6 December 1680, second son of the merchant Benjamin Spilman (<i>c</i>.1644&#150;1719) and his third wife, Susan Robins. An uncle, Samuel Spilman, shipped presents from the Russia Company to Peter the Great at Yarmouth in 1693. Spilman probably went to Russia in the wake of the tsar's European recruitment drive of 1697&#150;8, trading on his own account in 1701 or earlier. The tsar, having granted a lucrative monopoly of the Russian tobacco trade in 1698 to the London-based Tobacco Company, transferred it in 1704 to Moscow burgomasters. They signed a contract in February 1705 with Spilman and Samuel Martin, his co-factor, agents for a group of London businessmen, to supply tobacco and equipment, but the project was abandoned following an export ban. After the murder of Martin in 1709, Spilman, co-executor of his will, spent some time in England and was admitted to the freedom of the Russia Company on 8 June 1711.<br>
<br>When St Petersburg became the Russian capital in 1712, Spilman replaced Henry Stiles as senior English merchant, responsible to the tsar for recruiting English naval and industrial personnel, and for training Russians in England. Simultaneously he partnered Henry Hodgkin, a factor merchant, trading with several north European countries as well as with Britain. Their intervention helped to secure the election on 29 July 1714 to the Royal Society of Prince Menshikov, Russia's second most powerful figure and its leading industrial entrepreneur.<br>
<br>Although appointed to the Russia Company's court of assistants in March 1718, Spilman continued with his business concerns in Russia until 1721. On 13 April 1723 he married Hester, daughter of William Willys, a Hamburg and Russia merchant, the sister and coheir of Sir Thomas Willys (<i>d</i>. April 1732), sixth baronet, of Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire. Their only child, Julia, was baptized in September 1724, when they were living at Park Place, near St James's Palace. By the 1730s they had moved to Conduit Street, close to Hanover Square.<br>
<br>Spilman was on the Russia Company's court of assistants for many years, becoming its auditor (1729&#150;40) and consul (1733&#150;5). His considerable knowledge and expertise was utilized on various committees: Baltic lightships (1725), management of the company's trade and legal affairs (1728), and briefing the Board of Trade on Russian court contracts (1736); however, his major contributions were in drawing up an Anglo-Russian treaty of commerce (1732&#150;4) and drafting a memorial to the Treasury for importing Persian silk through Russia (1735). In 1742 he published <span class="italic">A Journey through Russia into Persia</span>, containing an account by John Elton and Mungo Graeme (or Graham) of their exploring in 1739 the prospects for British trans-Caspian trade from Astrakhan to Persia. The treatise was dedicated to Spilman's colleague, Sir John Thompson, a prominent cloth merchant, shipowner, and Russia Company governor (1740&#150;49). Spilman received the freedom of Yarmouth in 1750.<br>
<br>A long-serving director of the Bank of England (1730&#150;62), Spilman was concurrently an active commissioner of the Royal Hospital at Greenwich (1732&#150;62), attending its committee meetings on eighty occasions and, with Sir John Thompson, acting as trustee to the Derwentwater estates. Spilman was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 31 October 1734 and council member in 1743. When admitted on 14 November 1734, he presented the society with three items given to him by Peter the Great: a snuff-box of granadilla wood made by the tsar, a fragrant stick of golden birchwood from Samarkand, and a piece purported to be of Noah's ark, but &#145;undoubtedly brought from Mount Ararat&#146;. The society's journal books and certificates (1734&#150;49) provide evidence of Spilman's interest in Russian and general natural history, and of his significant Anglo-Russian connections. Six book subscriptions (1735&#150;57) partly reflect the promotion of experimental philosophy, stressed as a qualification in his election certificate (4 April 1734).<br>
<br>Spilman's wife, Hester, died on 23 August 1761, aged seventy-two, and his own death followed in London on 21 November 1763. He was buried at Waltham Abbey Holy Cross, Essex, commemorated by a marble monumental inscription in the north aisle wall. Their daughter, Julia, who married George Richard Carter of Chilton, Buckinghamshire, in 1753, was granted an administration in December 1763.<br>
