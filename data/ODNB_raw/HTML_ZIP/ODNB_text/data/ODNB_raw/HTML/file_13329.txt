<span class="headword">Hilton,  William</span>  (1786&#150;1839), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Lincoln on 3 June 1786, the son of the japanner and scenery and portrait painter William Hilton (1752&#150;1822) and his wife, Mary (1755&#150;1835). He was renowned as a painter of history and like Benjamin Robert Haydon attempted to turn the taste of English collectors away from portraiture and landscape in the interests of establishing the school of grand manner painting as advocated by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He retained close connections with Lincoln and is commemorated in the cathedral alongside his close friend Peter DeWint, with whom he had studied under the engraver John Raphael Smith (<i>c</i>.1801) and who became his brother-in-law. A visit to Paris in 1814 was followed by his tour of Italy with Thomas Phillips in 1825 when they met David Wilkie, Dawson Turner, and Seymour Stocker Kirkup. Hilton entered the Royal Academy Schools on 4 January 1806, was elected associate of the Royal Academy in 1813, Royal Academician in 1819 (<span class="italic">The Theft of Ganymede</span>, RA Diploma Gallery), and became keeper in 1827. His friends included John Taylor, John Keats, Charles Lamb, and John Clare, who described him as &#145;the most unlike Londoner I saw&#146;  (Clare to J. A. Hessey, 2 April 1820, <span class="italic">Letters</span>). His uncompromising stance towards portraiture (fine portraits survive of his family&#151;for example <span class="italic">Mrs. Harriet de Wint and her Daughter</span>, Usher Art Gallery, Lincoln)&#151;and the production of large-scale oil paintings necessitating great investment of time and materials resulted in hardship. But recognition came in limited but, for the period, significant ways. In 1814 the British Institution purchased his <span class="italic">Mary Anointing the Feet of Jesus</span> for &pound;525 and presented it to St Michael, Cornhill (des.; version Usher Art Gallery). Sir John Fleming Leicester commissioned two works: in 1818 <span class="italic">The Rape of Europa</span> (250 guineas; sold de Tabley sale, 7 July 1827, 300 guineas to the earl of Egremont; still at Petworth House, Sussex) and in 1820 <span class="italic">The Mermaid</span> (100 guineas, still at Tabley House, Cheshire). Both were hung at his purpose-designed gallery in Hill Street, London, alongside works by Gainsborough, Reynolds, and West. Robert Vernon, another pioneer patron of contemporary British art, bought his <span class="italic">Rebecca at the Well</span> (exh. RA, 1833; Tate collection). In 1827 Hilton was commissioned to design an east window for St George's Church, Liverpool (rebuilt 1819&#150;25). Hilton was paid 1000 guineas for his triptych <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span> (painted window dem. with church, <i>c</i>.1902; design in Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). The city of Lincoln granted Hilton its freedom on 28 January 1828. In 1834 Sir John Soane commissioned <span class="italic">Marc Antony Reading Caesar's Will</span> for his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields (100 guineas, Sir John Soane's Museum, London). <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span> was engraved by W. Finden for the Art Union in 1847. Other works by Hilton deemed sufficiently popular to be engraved were <span class="italic">The Rape of Europa</span> and <span class="italic">Sir Calepine Rescuing Serena</span>, purchased by subscription after his death and presented to the National Gallery, London. By 1839 commissions from churches had dwindled, domestic accommodation seldom permitted canvases measuring 8 feet by 6, and interest in mythological and biblical subjects had given way to contemporary genre painting. Hilton died at Peter DeWint's house at 40 Upper Gower Street, London, on 30 December 1839, two years after his wife Justina (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kent) and just before the scheme to decorate the houses of parliament brought both employment and frustration to a new generation of artists. He was buried in the chapel of the Savoy, Strand, London. At a studio sale on 4 June 1841 organized by his executor, DeWint, the efforts of a lifetime went for what Hilton's sister saw as lamentably low sums. Hilton employed bitumen in his work and as a result many of his paintings are now in poor condition. At best it is still possible to see why the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1855 thought his poetical compositions distinguished by the highest qualities and why a German connoisseur, Waagen, found his &#145;an unusual talent for historical painting, being intellectual in invention&#146; while the &#145;slender encouragement he received&#146; showed &#145;how little the taste for historical painting prevails in England&#146;  (Waagen, 1.372).<br>
