<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Mark Aitchison</span>  (1886&#150;1974), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 30 June 1886 in India, the third son of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37081/', "Sir William Mackworth Young (1840&#150;1924)")</script>, lieutenant-governor of the Punjab from 1897 to 1902, and his wife, Frances Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Eyles Egerton and his wife, Mary Warren Hickey. He was educated at Eton College and then at King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first-class degree in classics. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37073/', "Geoffrey Winthrop Young (1876&#150;1958)")</script> was his cousin and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37077/', "Sir Hubert Winthrop Young (1885&#150;1950)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34769/', "Gerard Mackworth-Young (1884&#150;1965)")</script> were his elder brothers. Young joined the colonial service as an eastern cadet in Ceylon in 1909. His career was interrupted by service in the First World War, but he rose to the rank of principal assistant colonial secretary in 1923&#150;8. He then served as colonial secretary in Sierra Leone in 1928&#150;30 and Palestine in 1930&#150;33, before being promoted governor of Barbados, where he served from 1933 to 1938. From November 1937 to February 1938 he also administered the government of Trinidad and Tobago and then served as governor of the Tanganyika Territory in 1938&#150;41. He married Josephine Mary, daughter of Walter C. Price, and they had six children. Young was appointed CMG in 1931 and was knighted in 1934.<br>
<br>Sharp minded, intelligent, courageous, far-sighted, energetic, dedicated to doing his duties as well as possible, somewhat austere in character, and very able as an administrator, Young often appeared intimidating to people of lesser intellect. These personal qualities were put to test when he became governor of the Tanganyika Territory. With war looming in Europe there was considerable apprehension in the territory that it might be returned to its former German rulers as part of a deal for appeasement. To allay such concern Young quickly set about laying down plans for economic and other developments, and enlarged the legislative and the executive councils. Confidence returned. When war broke out he swiftly disarmed and interned the large German population, which removed a potential source of instability and maintained good order and morale. It was the strong leadership, resilience, and resourcefulness which he showed in Tanganyika that commended him to the British government to take charge of Hong Kong on the eve of the Pacific war.<br>
<br>When Young assumed the governorship on 10 September 1941 a Japanese attack on Hong Kong was a real possibility, and Britain was in no position to relieve the colony. Prime Minister Winston Churchill knew Hong Kong could not be defended and instructed Young to hold it for as long as possible in order to give the British empire time to prepare for the eventual counter-attack. With about 10,000 men at his disposal, including two newly arrived Canadian battalions which were not combat ready, Young took Churchill's instruction to heart and put up the most gallant defence in Britain's Asian empire. Repeatedly he refused the demand of the overwhelmingly superior Japanese forces to capitulate. When he did eventually become the first British governor to surrender a colony during the war, on Christmas day 1941, he was told by the senior military commander Major-General Christopher Malby that useful military resistance was no longer possible. He surrendered in order to reduce further heavy loss of life and to avoid provoking the Japanese to brutalize the civilian population. Nevertheless, following Churchill's order to resist with utmost stubbornness &#145;in spirit and to the letter&#146;, the Hong Kong garrison under Young earned, in Churchill's words, the &#145;lasting honour&#146;  (Churchill, 3.563). He was a prisoner of the Japanese, in Taiwan and Manchuria until August 1945.<br>
<br>Young's other major contribution was in energetically pursuing an albeit limited programme of democratic reform in post-war Hong Kong. At the end of the war, Young took about eight months to restore his health from the deprivations and sufferings as a Japanese prisoner of war. Advanced to GCMG, he was sent back to resume his interrupted governorship on 1 May 1946 so as to restore his, and above all, Britain's military honour. However, because of a recognition that a return to the <i>status quo ante</i> would be seized upon by the Chinese government to clamour for the retrocession of Hong Kong, London felt it necessary to limit his remaining tenure to one year. Upon his return, Young carefully tested public opinion and vigorously pushed for the introduction of what in effect was a &#145;super municipal council&#146;, with &#145;a degree of administrative and financial autonomy unknown in other British municipal councils&#146;  (Tsang, <span class="italic">Democracy Shelved</span>, 183&#150;4) of the time so that it could, if the political environment should permit, gradually replace the existing colonial government and give the local Chinese greater self-government. Young advocated such an unorthodox approach because he believed the only way to keep the colony British in the face of Chinese irredentism was to persuade the local people to embrace the idea of keeping Hong Kong within the British empire-Commonwealth.<br>
<br>In order to achieve these objectives Young saw no better way than to involve the local people in the administration of their own affairs. He also recognized the reality that the Chinese people of Hong Kong in those days were divided in their loyalty, above all between the two warring factions in the Chinese Civil War, the ruling Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, and normal democratization at the colonial legislature might lead to it being turned into a political cockpit of the two Chinese parties. Hence, his proposals for a &#145;super municipal council&#146; by which the electoral elements could be introduced and gradually expanded and, if the elected members should prove politically responsible, its scope of government expanded without allowing Chinese politics to dominate its proceedings. Young advocated democratization in Hong Kong partly in response to the general British recognition that a new approach had become desirable, but mainly to pre-empt irrendentist pressure from China. Although his reform proposals were approved by London they did not survive his retirement on 17 May 1947. His successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64117/', "Sir Alexander Grantham")</script>, deemed him misguided and reversed course, leading to the eventual abandonment of any major political reform in 1952, a position that was maintained until the onset of Sino-British negotiations over the future of Hong Kong in the early 1980s.<br>
<br>After he left Hong Kong, Young retired to Winchester where he devoted much time to his great love, music. In particular he enjoyed the piano and choral singing; but he also renewed his interest in the classics, and read widely. He died on 12 May 1974 at Bereweeke Nursing Home, Winchester.<br>
