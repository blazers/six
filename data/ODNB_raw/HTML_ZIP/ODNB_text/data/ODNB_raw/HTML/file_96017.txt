<span class="headword">Fitter,  Richard Sidney Richmond</span>  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 1 March 1913 at 14 Mount Nod Road, Streatham, London, the only son of Sidney Harry Fitter, produce broker, and his wife, Dorothy Isacke, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pound. He was educated at Eastbourne College (1926&#150;9), where his enthusiasm for natural history was encouraged by his headmaster, E. C. Arnold, and at the London School of Economics (1929&#150;32), where he graduated in economics and became research assistant to Ivor Jennings. He was recruited in 1936 to the think-tank Political and Economic Planning (PEP) by its general secretary, Max Nicholson, whom he had met the year before through their common interest in ornithology. On 19 April 1938 he married Alice Mary (Maisie) Stewart Park, the 25-year-old daughter of Robert Stewart Park, medical doctor. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1940 Fitter moved from PEP to Mass-Observation (led by another ornithologist, Tom Harrisson), to investigate civilian morale for the Ministry of Information. He was then recruited to the operational research section of Coastal Command in 1942, as assistant editor of <span class="italic">Coastal Command Review</span>, in which post he spent the remainder of the Second World War. These posts developed his ability to write technical reports in the brief but lucid style that became the bedrock of his later career.<br>
<br>Fitter had become active in the London Natural History Society about 1934, assisting with surveys, sitting on committees, serving as &#145;recorder&#146; for various sorts of animals, editing journals, and writing reports, with papers in <span class="italic">Nature</span> on the colonization of England by the black redstart and on the effects of the war on birds. Like many of his contemporaries he took the war as an opportunity to plan for a better world. He was a member of the Post War Aims Group, which within a month of the outbreak of war published a statement on war aims, and later he was invited to become secretary of the Wildlife Conservation Special Committee, chaired by Julian Huxley (another ornithological contact). Fitter's main role was to draw up lists of potential nature reserves, making many site visits in his spare time. The committee's report, <span class="italic">Conservation of Nature in England and Wales</span> (Cmd 7122, 1947), led to the establishment of national parks and the Nature Conservancy.<br>
<br>Fitter's first book, <span class="italic">London's Natural History</span> (1945), was a masterly synthesis in urban ecology, showing how the interaction of man and wildlife had developed over the centuries. It established him as a writer and was followed by <span class="italic">London's Birds</span> (1949) and several other contributions to urban natural history. In 1946 he left London for Burford, Oxfordshire, having been appointed assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Countryman</span>, a position he held for thirteen years while his own writing career blossomed. In 1952 he published the first modern &#145;field guide&#146;, the Collins <span class="italic">Pocket Guide to British Birds</span>, illustrated by R. A. Richardson. Designed to allow even the inexperienced to identify birds, it unusually (but helpfully) arranged the species by habitat and size. It was hugely successful and he produced about a dozen other field guides, including the <span class="italic">Pocket Guide to Nests and Eggs</span> (1955, also superbly illustrated by Richardson) and the <span class="italic">Collins Guide to Bird Watching</span> (1963). The <span class="italic">Pocket Guide to Wild Flowers</span> (1956, co-written with David McClintock) and <span class="italic">Birds of Britain and Europe with North Africa and the Middle East</span> (1972, with illustrations by Herman Heinzel and maps by John Parslow) were again innovative: the former abandoned the traditional dry keys and focused on the colour, form, and size of flowers to guide the inexperienced to an identification, while the new bird book had the pictures of each species opposite the relevant text rather than in separate blocks. With his wife, Maisie, he also wrote the <span class="italic">Penguin Dictionary of British Natural History</span> (1967).<br>
<br>Fitter became the most influential natural history author of the second half of the twentieth century in Britain, through his field guides, his approximately twenty other books, and his articles, especially his notes, &#145;Fitter's rural rides&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> newspaper. The <span class="italic">Ark in Our Midst</span> (1959) was a masterly compilation of the attempts to introduce alien vertebrate species into Britain, and <span class="italic">Penitent Butchers</span> (1978) a useful history of the Fauna Preservation Society, later the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society.<br>
<br>Fitter was also a pioneer of the post-war nature conservation movement, largely in a voluntary capacity. He served as director of the intelligence unit of the Council for Nature (1959&#150;63); on the species survival commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (1963&#150;88, chairman from 1975); and as honorary secretary (1964&#150;71), and later chairman (1983&#150;7) and vice-president (1988&#150;2005) of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society, at one point its British business being effectively run by him and his wife. He was much involved in the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire Naturalists' Trust and served the World Wildlife Fund, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the British Trust for Ornithology, and many other bodies in honorary positions. His contributions were based on his deep knowledge of the facts and issues, his capacity for organization, and the easy warmth of his modest personality. He was appointed an officer of the order of the Golden Ark, in the Netherlands (1978), and awarded the Christopher Cadbury medal of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation (1998) and the Peter Scott medal of the British Naturalists' Association (also 1998).<br>
<br>Fitter remained active until the end of his life. In 2000 his presidential address to the London Natural History Society was about the likely impacts of global warming on wildlife, and two years later he wrote, with his son Alastair (professor of biology at the University of York), a paper in the journal <span class="italic">Science</span> on changes in flowering time of British plants, based on forty-seven years' observation of 385 species around his home in Chinnor in the Chilterns. At the time of his death he was revising his book <span class="italic">Finding Wild Flowers</span>, first published in 1971, preparing a flora of France, and working on an unusual autobiography, based on the influences that the places he had visited had had on him. Having lived latterly in Great Shelford, Cambridge, he died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 3 September 2005, of complications of prostatic cancer. He was survived by his three children, his wife, Maisie, having predeceased him in 1996.<br>
