<span class="headword">Donovan,  Edward</span>  (1768&#150;1837), <span class="occ">natural historian and artist</span>, is of obscure origin and little is known of his early life and education. His interest in natural history started with the collecting of shells and preservation of insects, probably before 1788. He was a prolific author and skilled artist who etched and engraved the plates for all his works. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society.<br>
<br>Donovan's main interest was entomology and his published works included sixteen volumes of <span class="italic">British Insects</span> (1792&#150;1813) and three volumes on <span class="italic">The Insects of China, India and New Holland</span>, the last being dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks, and acknowledging use of his collections and library. Donovan's approach was to show species that had not been illustrated before, and many previously undescribed. Publications on other animals and plants were well received, including ten volumes of <span class="italic">British Birds</span> (1799). Donovan's other major works included <span class="italic">British Fishes</span> (1802&#150;8), and the <span class="italic">Botanical Review, or, The Beauties of Flora</span> (1789&#150;96). His books were not of even quality and it is generally considered that he was at his best illustrating insects. In 1805 he published two volumes, <span class="italic">Descriptive Excursions through South Wales</span>, describing his travels through Monmouthshire. Donovan's plates were all engraved, hand coloured, and accompanied by a description and synonyms for each species depicted. All were published in parts; his proposal was to issue one number every two months at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for each part. His early botanical plates are signed E. O. Donovan; this led to his being quoted as O'Donovan. After about 1790 he no longer used E. O. and the confusion ceased. Some contemporaries regarded the colouring of Donovan's plates as gaudy but later nineteenth- and twentieth-century opinion was, in general, much more favourable.<br>
<br>Donovan was clearly endowed with a considerable fortune, spending freely to acquire specimens, including many insects from Dru Drury's collection. He bought many collections and paid high prices for some specimens (it is known he paid 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for a black-toed gull and 10 guineas for a great auk at the sale of the Leveren Museum). His whole natural history collection cost him several thousands of pounds and with it he established the London Museum and Institute of Natural History in Catherine Street, the Strand. The museum was opened to the public in 1807, with the general consensus that it was &#145;a much more valuable assortment of particular specimens than the richest Cabinets of Europe&#146;. An entrance fee of 1<i>s</i>. was charged, and 6<i>d</i>. for the catalogue. By 1817, however, Donovan's finances began to decline. His labours of some thirty years at a cost of some &pound;15,000 had to come to an end. A prospectus for sale of his collection was issued with the hope that funds would be raised to keep it intact, probably in the British Museum; this hope was not fulfilled and it was broken up and auctioned.<br>
<br>By 1833 Donovan found himself in serious financial straits. He insisted that his publishers owed him large sums of money, but in reality he had not been a good businessman. He wanted to take his case to the court of chancery, but had not the wherewithal to do so. In that year he issued a plea &#145;To the patrons of science, literature and fine arts&#146; asking for help to submit his case to the court. He described how from his first production he had verbally agreed with his publishers that they should have half the proceeds of that work and the same amount on any later publications. This would have given him a good income, since a full set of his works sold for &pound;100; however, by withholding accounts for six years, under the existing statutes of limitation the booksellers avoided payment and Donovan was financially ruined. He was owed between &pound;60,000 and &pound;70,000. He had truthfully stated that there was no documentary evidence for his case, and this assured that costly legal action would not succeed.<br>
<br>Once a man of great substance, when Donovan died on 1 February 1837 at his home, John Street, Kennington Road, London, he left a large family in destitution.<br>
