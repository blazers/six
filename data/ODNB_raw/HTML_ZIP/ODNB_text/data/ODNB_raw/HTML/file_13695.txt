<span class="headword">Hooker <span class="st"> [Vowell]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1527&#150;1601), <span class="occ">antiquary and civic administrator</span>, was born at Bourbridge Hall, Exeter, the second son of Robert Vowell or Hooker of Exeter (<i>b</i>. in or before 1466, <i>d</i>. 1537) and his third wife, Agnes Doble (1502?&#150;1537) of Woodbridge, Suffolk. The Vowell family had originated in Pembrokeshire, acquiring the name Hooker through marriage to a Hampshire heiress in the fifteenth century; however, John's forebears usually styled themselves Vowell, and John himself was known by that name for much of his life. By the early sixteenth century the family had been prominent in Exeter for several generations.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>John Hooker's parents both died in summer 1537. The education of their son, who was aged about ten, was then entrusted to Dr John Moreman, vicar of Menheniot, Cornwall, of whom Hooker retained affectionate memories&#151;&#145;of a verye honest and good nature, lovinge to all men and hurtefull to none&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 5827, fols. 45<i>v</i>&#150;46<i>r</i>). Hooker is also the principal source for the rest of his own education. He proceeded to Oxford to read civil law, most likely at Corpus Christi College, but left without taking a degree and went abroad, studying law at Cologne and afterwards theology at Strasbourg, where he stayed with Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr). After a brief visit to England he crossed to France, but the outbreak of war, presumably that of 1544, dashed his hopes of further travel and he returned home, where he was &#145;dryven to take a wyffe&#146;  (ibid., fol. 51<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). She was Martha (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1500?), daughter of Robert Toker or Tucker of Exeter; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>His staying with Vermigli and many passages in his own writings make it clear that John Hooker was evangelical in religion. He was in Exeter when the city was besieged for several weeks during the western rebellion of 1549, and left a vivid account of events&#151;&#145;where at I the writer was present and testis oculatus [eyewitness] of the things ther donne&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">Description</span>, 1.55). The moving force behind the rising was religion in the form of traditional Catholicism, which had its adherents within the city as well as among the rebels. Hooker denounces those who chose &#145;to supporte the authoritie of the Idoll of Rome whome they never sawe in contempte of their trewe &amp; lawfull kinge, whom they knewe and oughte to obeye&#146; even though he admits that they were in a majority in Exeter, and makes it clear that his own place was in that minority which &#145;wholye replyed them selffes to the reformed religion: and to the kinges proceadings&#146;  (ibid., 67, 71). But his religious partisanship cannot conceal his pride in the valour of the westerners in their resistance to the king's army, and he reflects sadly on the fate of Robert Welsh, the vicar of St Thomas, who had saved the city from burning but was nevertheless hanged in his vestments from his own church tower: &#145;he was a companyon in anye exercises of activitie &amp; of a courtuose and gentle behavio<sup>r</sup> &hellip; he had benne a good member in his commonwelthe had not the weedes overgrowne the good corne&#146;  (ibid., 91&#150;4).<br>
<br>In 1551 Hooker was in the employment of Miles Coverdale, newly appointed bishop of Exeter, on whose behalf he went to Oxford and there obtained for the bishop the services of Robert Weston as his vicar-general. But following Mary's accession Coverdale went abroad, and in 1555 Hooker found secular employment, as the first chamberlain of Exeter. His important office was central to the civic finances&#151;the chamberlain was responsible for the administration of the city's properties, for example&#151;and Hooker can hardly have exaggerated when he wrote that it required a man &#145;wyse and lerned and of great modestie and sobrietie&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">Description</span>, 1.814). In 1559 he gave legal advice to the city's merchant adventurers in a dispute with the craft guilds over the former's new charter of incorporation, and two years later oversaw the rebuilding of Exeter's high school. He applied himself to beautifying Exeter by planting trees, and above all he collected and arranged the city's records, producing what he described as:<blockquote>An Abstracte of all the Orders &amp; ordynances extent made, enacted &amp; ordayned by the Maiors &amp; Common Councell of the Citie of Excester for the tyme beinge for the good goverment of the sayde Citie &amp; Commonwelth of the same. (ibid., 863)</blockquote>The labour was a considerable one, involving documents from the reign of Henry III onwards.<h2>
<a name="Ireland"></a>Ireland</h2>Given his efforts on Exeter's behalf, Hooker regarded himself as underpaid, and also as underappreciated in some quarters&#151;there were men &#145;who most unkyndly and agaynst all humanitie have traduced and most bitterly Chardged me wi<sup>th</sup> and false reports&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">Description</span>, 1.5). This may help explain why in 1568 he went to Ireland in the service of Sir Peter Carew, who after an adventurous career in England and on the continent had decided to rebuild his fortunes by establishing himself on lands held by his ancestors across the Irish Sea. Carew had a substantial body of written evidence, but was unable to read it, and therefore turned to Hooker as a man who was &#145;greatly given to seek and search old records and antient writings, and was very skilful in reading of them&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">Carew</span>, 71). Hooker put the Carew papers in order and drew up a pedigree for Sir Peter, who was so pleased that he persuaded Hooker to go to Ireland with him as his legal adviser. In Dublin Hooker also found relevant documents in Dublin Castle, and committed himself so wholeheartedly to Carew's cause&#151;principally directed towards securing the barony of Idrone, co. Carlow&#151;that in 1569 he was returned to the Irish parliament as member for Athenry, and made a speech in defence of an impost on wine that led to his being threatened with violence.<br>
<br>The principal source for Hooker's activities in Ireland is his own life of Carew, a remarkable exercise in biography and also a highly original one, in recounting the story of a man whose status was only that of a gentleman. That originality extends to Hooker's treatment of his subject, for Sir Peter is presented as combining the stereotypical virtues of the English landowner with new elements of Renaissance culture; thus he is not only a bold and straightforward man of action, but also a jouster, courtier, and traveller who makes his way (always at his ease, whatever the risk) across Europe as far as Constantinople. In his eagerness to present Sir Peter as a man of honour (and perhaps also because he was heavily dependent on the latter for evidence), Hooker almost certainly underplays the violence and chicanery behind Carew's Irish venture, which had a seriously unsettling effect upon Munster, in particular, and thus also understates his own supporting role. He probably helped provoke a quarrel with the Butlers, who held the western part of Idrone, and, though he sometimes returned to Exeter, he nevertheless acted variously as Carew's rent collector, representative, and trustee. In 1574 he found houses for his employer in Cork and Kinsale.<h2>
<a name="AuthorityonparliamentreviserofHolinshed"></a>Authority on parliament, reviser of Holinshed</h2>Carew died on 27 November 1575, and Hooker, who had attended Sir Peter's exequies, returned to England for good. His parliamentary experience was not confined to Ireland, for in 1571 he had been returned to the English parliament as one of the burgesses for Exeter. He kept a journal of proceedings (which only lasted a few weeks), the first of its kind. It accurately relates the business of the session, shedding valuable light on such aspects of parliamentary procedure as the role of the judges during deliberations. His experiences in the Irish and English parliaments led to his writing a treatise on parliamentary practice, <span class="italic">The Order and Usage how to Keepe a Parlement in England</span>, which was published in two different editions in 1572. One, with a preface addressed to Sir William Fitzwilliam, who was then governor of Ireland, was overtly intended to bring order to the Irish assembly, and seems to have had that effect, becoming the principal authority for proceedings at Dublin for decades afterwards. The other, addressed to the Exeter city authorities, was presumably for the benefit of Hooker's successors as parliamentary burgesses, at a time when the rules and procedures of the House of Commons were &#145;to most men hidden and unknowen&#146;  (Snow, 125). The treatise is historiographically important for printing the early fourteenth-century treatise <span class="italic">Modus tenendi parliamentum</span>; the fact that Hooker misdates it to the reign of Edward the Confessor is a reflection of his high view of the status of parliament, and of the House of Commons within it. The monarch was the moving force in parliament, which Hooker saw as above all a court, but under her the Commons constituted the essential element&#151;he argued that if necessary queen and Commons could disregard the Lords to enact legislation.<br>
<br>Hooker represented Exeter in parliament again in 1586. By this time he was engaged in another historiographical enterprise, the second edition of Raphael Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, which appeared in 1587. Hooker was at one time considered to have been the principal editor; that position is now more often ascribed to Abraham Fleming, but Hooker's contribution was certainly a major one. Not only was his <span class="italic">Order and Usage</span> incorporated in the English section, but he also provided an updated history of Ireland, which included both a translation of the late twelfth-century <span class="italic">Expugnatio Hibernica</span> of Gerald of Wales and a condensed version of Hooker's own life of Sir Peter Carew. His Irish section sheds revealing light on Hooker's political and religious views. In his dedicatory epistle he makes a direct link between loyalty to the established order and God's blessing, as he compares the desolate condition of the native Irish with the prosperity of the English pale: &#145;Two notable examples (I saie) and worthie to be throughlie observed; the one of Gods just judgment against the rebels and traitors, and the other of mercie and love towards the obedient and dutifull subject&#146;. And in accordance with this viewpoint he repeatedly denounces the Catholicism of the Irish, which he sees as the prime cause of their persistent rebelliousness, with a virulence unmatched anywhere else in his writings. Rome is &#145;the pestilent hydra&#146;, the pope &#145;the sonne of sathan, and the manne of sinne, and the enimie unto the crosse of Christ, whose bloodthirstiness will never be quenched&#146;  (Holinshed, 2.168, 182).<h2>
<a name="ThehistorianofDevon"></a>The historian of Devon</h2>In his other writings Hooker shows himself a loyal protestant, but in writing about the Catholic past, as opposed to present-day adherents of Rome, he adopted a less extreme position. In his later years he continued to serve his native city, becoming coroner there in 1583 and recorder in 1590, and he was also appointed steward of Bradninch by Sir Walter Ralegh in 1587. But his energies seem to have been increasingly devoted to historical research and writing. He became a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72906/', "Society of Antiquaries")</script>, and a friend of Richard Carew, who in his <span class="italic">Survey of Cornwall</span> refers to &#145;the commendable painful antiquary, and my kind friend Master Hooker&#146;  (Snow, 24). Of his writings, his <span class="italic">Description of the Citie of Excester</span> was published in 1919&#150;47, but others remain wholly or partly unprinted, including his &#145;Catalogue of the bishops of Excester&#146; (partly printed, like a number of his writings, in Holinshed) and a &#145;Synopsis chorographicall of Devonshire&#146; (several manuscripts, including BL, Harley MS 5827). The latter was never finished, but was nevertheless highly influential for later Devon historians. Its structure is indebted to William Harrison, whose <span class="italic">Description of England</span>, a pioneering work of social and economic analysis, supplied the preface to Holinshed. Hooker was no mere plagiarist, however, but a diligent and affectionate observer of his native city and county. Like other chorographers he devoted much space to the history and heraldry of gentry families, but he also noted the wealth of particular places, for instance by giving the subsidy assessments for the county's boroughs, and did not miss the importance of fishing in the local economy, especially that of pilchards during the summer months.<br>
<br>Interested in sources of wealth, Hooker also observed the uses to which it was put, for instance praising the third earl of Bath for his lavish spending at Tawstock, where he &#145;dothe contynewally keepe in most bountefull order to his greate honor &amp; to the great good of the countri and to the releafe of the poor&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 5827, fol. 126<i>v</i>), while at Plymouth he noted the immense labour involved in Sir Francis Drake's project to give the town its first supply of fresh water. In his comments on the bishops of Exeter, too, he especially praises those who were builders, while denouncing John Veysey for giving away so much of the endowment of his see. Hooker is fair-minded in his accounts of the pre-Reformation bishops; Edmund Lacy, for instance, is allowed to have been &#145;a good a modest &amp; a discrete man &hellip; He was very devoute in the religion in those dayes&#146;  (ibid., fol. 70<i>r</i>). But his warmest praise is reserved for the protestant prelates of his own time, notably William Alley, where his character sketch has something of the same vividness as his life of Carew:<blockquote>He seemed at the first appeerance to be a rough and an austere man, but in verie truth, a verie courteous, gentle, and an affable man &hellip; All his exercises, which for the most part was at bowles, verie merrie and pleasant, void of all sadnesse &hellip; he was somewhat credulous, of a hastie beleefe, and light of credit, which he did oftentimes mislike &amp; blame in himselfe. (Holinshed, 3.1309)</blockquote>The same warmth informs almost everything Hooker writes about Exeter, which is repeatedly praised for the beauty of its position and buildings, led by the cathedral&#151;&#145;a verie fayre and a sumptuose buyldinge&#146;  (Hooker, <span class="italic">Description</span>, 2.35). Unsurprisingly, he was responsible for the first map of the city, a splendid one engraved by Remigius Hogenberg at Hooker's expense in 1587. By this time his wife, Martha, had died, and Hooker had married Anastryce (<i>c</i>.1540?&#150;1599), daughter of Edward Bridgeman of Exeter. They had seven sons and five daughters. One of his daughters, Alice, married the godly clergyman John Travers. Hooker's health began to fail, and he wrote to the corporation of Exeter describing himself as &#145;Drawen in to yeres and bearinge the borden of sondry infirmities &hellip; for my sight waxeth Dymme my hyringe [hearing] very thycke my speache imperfecte and my memory very feeble&#146;  (ibid., 2.4). He died in Exeter in 1601, some time between 26 January and 15 September, and was probably buried in the cathedral.<br>
