<span class="headword">Cooke,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1756&#150;1838), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Lancashire but was descended from a family from Edith Weston, Rutlandshire. He was educated at the school established by Philip Doddridge at Northampton, and at first intended to become a dissenting minister. He preached at Rochdale and at Preston but later turned his attention to medicine. He studied at Guy's Hospital in London, at Edinburgh, and at Leiden, where he graduated MD in 1781. His thesis was on the use of cinchona bark in cases where there was no rise of temperature.<br>
<br>Cooke settled in London and became physician to the Royal General Dispensary in Bartholomew Close. In April 1784, after a drawn-out contest with John Whitehead, he was elected physician to the London Hospital, an office he held for twenty-three years. He delivered the first clinical lectures ever given in that institution. In June the same year he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1799 he was requested by the lord mayor of London to investigate the death of two men thought to have died of the plague. Cooke showed that the fears were groundless. In 1807 he was elected FRCP, and ten years later he became a fellow of the Royal Society. He was censor at the College of Physicians in 1811 and 1820, and he delivered the Croonian lectures in 1819, 1820, and 1821, and the Harveian oration in 1828. He was president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1822 and 1823.<br>
<br>In 1820 Cooke began the publication of <span class="italic">A Treatise on Nervous Diseases</span>, which was continued in 1821 and completed in 1823. An American edition, in one volume, was published in Boston in 1824. This work, based on Cooke's Croonian lectures, gives an account of the existing knowledge of hemiplegia, paraplegia, paralysis of separate nerves, epilepsy, apoplexy, lethargy, and hydrocephalus internus. Although it contains no important addition to medical knowledge, it shows considerable clinical acquaintance with the subject.<br>
<br>During his latter years Cooke gave up practice and went little into society. A fellow of the Antiquarian Society he was well-read and a classical scholar, and throughout life he studied and enjoyed Homer. He died at his house in Gower Street, London, on 1 January 1838.<br>
