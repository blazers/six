<span class="headword">Dick,  Robert</span>  (1810/11&#150;1866), <span class="occ">geologist and botanist</span>, was born, probably in January 1811, at Tullibody in Clackmannanshire, the second of four children of Thomas Dick, customs and excise officer at the Cambus Brewery, Tullibody; nothing is known about his mother. When Robert was ten his father married a Miss Knox, and the family moved to Dams Burn. He had begun his schooling at the Barony School, Tullibody, and after the move attended Menstrie parish school. Dick appears to have suffered under a jealous stepmother. He later wrote of these years: &#145;All my naturally buoyant, youthful spirits were broken. To this day I feel the effects. I cannot shake them off. It is this that still makes me shrink from the world&#146;  (Williamson, 6). It was largely through his stepmother's influence that plans for Dick to attend college were abandoned and, at the age of thirteen, he was apprenticed to a Mr Aikman, baker, of Tullibody. In some ways he was glad&#151;it was an escape from his stepmother's cruelty.<br>
<br>Although his working day was long, Dick remained interested in study and read widely, with a particular interest in botany. He spared no expense in obtaining the finest examples of natural science volumes he could obtain. When his library was sold after his death, it consisted of a remarkable 389 volumes, and was sold for &pound;32 12<i>s</i>. Dick completed his apprenticeship in 1828, and worked for three years as a journeyman baker in Leith, Glasgow, and Greenock. He then went to Thurso in Caithness, where his father was customs supervisor, and opened a baker's business in Wilson's Lane. He continued to study and his interests widened to include geology and natural history in general. He began to create collections of rocks, insects, and plants; through collection and exchange he ultimately accumulated a near perfect British flora. He is credited with rediscovering, around 1834, the <i>Hierochloe borealis</i>, or northern holy grass, a plant which had been dropped from British flora. He later contributed an account of this to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh  (<span class="italic">Ann. Nat. Hist.</span>, October 1854).<br>
<br>After Hugh Miller (1802&#150;1856) published <span class="italic">Old Red Sandstone</span> in 1841, Dick wrote to him and there followed a regular correspondence between the two. Dick was able to supply Miller with unique information and fine specimens of fossilized fish. Dick's information ultimately led Miller considerably to modify his <span class="italic">Old Red Sandstone</span>. He reportedly wrote of Dick, &#145;He has robbed himself to do me service&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Although Dick himself was never published, this did not prevent him from becoming a recognized authority on the geology and natural history of Caithness. He ably and freely assisted Sir Roderick Murchison and a number of other scientists in their research. In September 1853 he met Charles Peach (1800&#150;1886) and a friendship immediately developed. They would often go for walks together, and in time Peach came to know Dick better than any other; he wrote of his friend that he had a &#145;cheerful manner&#146;, a &#145;sparkling wit&#146;, and a &#145;frolicsome playfulness&#146;  (Williamson, 26).<br>
<br>Dick's life was one of poverty, illness, pain, and extreme fatigue. He would often walk more than 50 miles between one baking and the next, eating nothing but a few pieces of biscuit. Competition and a loss of flour by shipwreck in Aberdeen harbour in March 1863 practically ruined him, and his last years were passed in great privation. He never married but for many years he employed one Annie Mackay, who served him faithfully until he died. She looked after him and his business, especially when he was away collecting flora and fauna. Although he was often solitary, his contemporary biographer wrote of him, that &#145;To those who knew him best he was cheerful and social. He had a vein of innocent fun and satire about him, and he often turned his thoughts into rhyme&#146;  (Smiles). His lifelong passion was the pursuit of knowledge of nature. Even when later in life he was crippled with rheumatism, he would spend hours hunting for fossils. &#145;I have nearly killed myself several times with over-exertion&#146;, he wrote  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Dick died on 24 December 1866 at his home in Wilson's Lane, Thurso. His great public funeral was testimony to the growing public recognition of his achievements. It was, however, testimony too to the fact that those in Thurso, where he was buried, had never really been aware of the giant in their midst. Robert Dick had always been misunderstood by the community in which he lived. His manner of dress&#151;old and outdated&#151;his introverted nature, and his all-absorbing interest in nature, all contributed to his being seen as a figure of fun. But even though Dick was aware of this he never attempted to set the record straight, for, as he wrote, &#145;It is surely a strange time we live in when a poor devil cannot gather weeds without being made a nine days' wonder of some and a butt of derision of others&#146;  (Williamson, 12).<br>
