<span class="headword">Marzials,  Th&eacute;ophile-Jules-Henri</span>  (1850&#150;1920), <span class="occ">poet and songwriter</span>, was, according to his gravestone, born at Bagn&egrave;res de Bigorre, Hautes Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, France, on 20 December 1850. Though his family was living in France his birth was registered in Brussels. He was the youngest of the five children (two sons and three daughters) of Antoine-Th&eacute;ophile Marzials, a French protestant pastor, and his wife, Mary Ann Jackson, daughter of Thomas Jackson (1783&#150;1873), Wesleyan Methodist minister. Fran&ccedil;ois-Thomas, later Sir Frank Marzials (1840&#150;1912), who became accountant-general of the army and wrote biographies of writers, was his elder brother. In 1857 the family settled in London, at 2 Brunswick Row, Bloomsbury, on the appointment of Antoine-Th&eacute;ophile as pastor of the French protestant church at St Martin's-le-Grand.<br>
<br>Marzials Anglicized his Christian names as Theophilus Julian Henry, but was known on his books and to friends as Theo. As a lyricist he sometimes used the pseudonym Mike Beverley. In September 1870 he joined the staff of the British Museum, as junior assistant in the principal librarian's office. According to John Betjeman, Max Beerbohm remembered Marzials &#145;with flowing moustaches, long hair and a silk tie that fell in folds over the lapels of his coat&#146;. One day the superintendent of the museum's round reading-room witnessed Marzials, unaware of his presence, lean over the gallery and call out: &#145;Am I or am I not the darling of the reading room?&#146;  (Munro, 9).<br>
<br>In June 1881 Marzials's hours at the British Museum were reduced in view of ill health and his &#145;punctuality and general good conduct&#146;  (Paden, 61). That year he took several months' leave without pay to visit Corfu, but on applying again in November 1882 was advised to resign on grounds of health. He was granted a pension of &pound;38 a year.<br>
<br>In his young days Marzials was remembered by Ford Madox Hueffer in 1911 as &#145;the handsomest, the wittiest, the most brilliant and the most charming of poets&#146;  (Hueffer, 48). In 1872 he had published as a pamphlet <span class="italic">Passionate Dowsabella</span>, a poem put the next year into his verse collection <span class="italic">The Gallery of Pigeons</span>. Also in this volume was &#145;A Tragedy&#146;, with its concluding lines, &#145;Drop / Dead. / Plop, flop. / Plop.&#146;, which was anthologized by Richard Le Gallienne (1923), but by the end of the twentieth century was being claimed as the worst poem ever written. A review of the book said: &#145;Mr Marzials dwells among marble columns, oleanders, rebecks, pleasances, large-lipped women, soft brown limbs, and lissome thighs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 26 July 1873).<br>
<br>Marzials found great success with songs like &#145;Twickenham Ferry&#146; (words and music, 1878); a setting of Christina Rossetti's &#145;My Love is Come&#146;; and an English version of &#145;A Summer Night&#146; (1881) by Arthur Goring Thomas, for whose opera <span class="italic">Esmeralda</span> (1883) he and Alberto Randegger provided the libretto. Marzials became a friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, at whose house in Cheyne Walk he sang, and an intimate friend of Edmund Gosse, through whom he gained Swinburne's permission to set some of his poems to music, including &#145;Ask Nothing More of Me, Sweet&#146;, which became a popular ballad of the 1880s. Altogether Marzials published more than eighty songs. <span class="italic">Pan Pipes</span> (1883), settings of Elizabethan and seventeenth-century songs, had coloured illustrations by Walter Crane.<br>
<br>In 1884 Marzials was living in Florence, and wrote to Gosse of &#145;the life I so longed and prayed and worked for all those weary alien sodden years at the Museum&#146;  (Munro, 10). There he composed songs for the duchess of Teck and made an impression on her daughter May, later Queen Mary. In 1889 he stayed in Venice with John Addington Symonds, who wrote, &#145;He appears and disappears like a sprite, always eloquent and always bizarre&#146;  (ibid., 11).<br>
<br>In 1894 Marzials was at the dinner in Old Compton Street in London to mark the first number of <span class="italic">The Yellow Book</span>, which published poems by him in volumes 3 and 7. By then he was addicted to chloral. But in 1900 Gosse found him saner than before: &#145;Those people who say that he is incoherent, off his head, and so forth, must be misled by the rapidity of change which has always characterised his talk&#146;  (Munro, 13). In 1911 Hueffer believed Marzials was dead, and recalled his habit of carrying chocolate creams loose in his pocket: &#145;On the last occasion when I happened to catch sight of him, looking into a case of stuffed birds at South Kensington Museum, he had eaten five large chocolates in the space of two minutes&#146;  (Hueffer, 48).<br>
<br>From 1897 Marzials had lived, first at Blandford, Dorset, then shortly afterwards with his unmarried sister, Emilie-Louise, at Colyton, Devon, moving after her death to a ground-floor room at Elm Grove Farm, Colyton. A regular visitor found him occupying his bed in one corner day and night, beside a saucer of beetroot in vinegar, its smell mixing with chlorodyne, the fumes of an oil-lamp, and the steam from a stock pot always on the stove. A piano in the room was on occasion moved outdoors so he could play under the stars. Although he was always well groomed, he seldom wore socks, and slipped on boots without laces to walk outside. He had been seen barefoot in the garden in the early hours singing in a soft voice, taking up a flower now and then, kissing it, and murmuring, &#145;O, my pretty&#146;  (Munro, 15). He died at Colyton on 2 February 1920 and was buried in the cemetery there, under a stone with his dates and the inscription &#145;Fight the good fight of faith&#146;.<br>
