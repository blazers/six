<span class="headword">Grant,  Peter</span>  (1935&#150;1995), <span class="occ">rock group manager</span>, was born on 5 April 1935 in Birdhurst Road, Croydon, Surrey, the son of Dorothy Louise Grant, a private secretary, of South Norwood, Surrey. The name of his father is not recorded. He left school at thirteen and his height and weight&#151;he was 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 18&frac12; stone&#151;led to his taking work as a bouncer, a stand-in for the actor Robert Morley, and a wrestler (under the name of Count Bruno Alassio of Milan). In the late fifties Grant worked at the Two Is coffee bar in Soho, a popular venue on the London pop circuit, where he met Don Arden, the &#145;Al Capone of Pop&#146;, who offered him a job as a tour manager. Grant's business skills were sharpened by this association; it was when he toured America with the UK rock group the Animals in 1964 that he spotted the potential of the US market, where he later made his fortune.<br>
<br>By the mid-sixties Grant had taken over the management of the Yardbirds, a UK rock band. He saw it as his duty to do his best for his artists by making sure that they were fully paid. In pursuing this policy, he became known for his often brutal dealings with promoters; he was not shy of using his intimidating physique to ensure payment.<br>
<br>When the Yardbirds split up in 1968 the band's guitarist Jimmy Page invited Grant to become the manager of his new band, Led Zeppelin. Page saw him as the manager who could ensure that the band kept control of their assets. While Page developed the band musically, Grant's marketing strategies and fearsome management techniques launched it into the stratosphere of the global rock business. He was regarded as the band's fifth member and took a 20 per cent share of the proceeds.<br>
<br>Grant's reputation as one of rock's shrewdest brains was evident in his negotiations with Atlantic Records when Led Zeppelin became the first rock band to appear on this prestigious rhythm and blues label. They received an astonishing $200,000 advance and the highest royalty rate hitherto negotiated by a group for their first album. The subsequent tremendous success of their albums can be ascribed to the band's musicianship and to Grant's albums-only policy. This strategy meant that the US FM radio stations, which were playing to Led Zeppelin's targeted &#145;underground rock&#146; audience, would play the whole side of a Zeppelin album, rather than just singles lifted from the record. Eventually Atlantic allowed them to establish their own label, Swansong, which Grant ran until 1983.<br>
<br>However, Grant's notoriety as one of the toughest operators in rock history (aided and abetted by tour manager Richard Cole) was also made during the band's relentless touring of the US throughout the early to mid-seventies. Along with legendary tales of grotesque indulgence and debauchery, Grant's Svengali-like influence saw Led Zeppelin fill cavernous venues and negotiate with promoters up front a deal ensuring the band an extraordinary 90 per cent of the profits. In 1973 Zeppelin played to 56,800 people at Tampa Stadium, Florida, and grossed $309,000, thereby breaking the previous US box office record, set by a Beatles concert at Shea Stadium.<br>
<br>In many respects Grant's intimidating physical presence had produced this success. However, his and Coles's tendency to violence (most especially directed against bootleggers and other non-sanctioned merchandisers) eventually caught up with them. On the 1977 tour of the US they were arrested, along with the drummer John Bonham and security chief John Bindon, for assaulting one of promoter Bill Graham's security guards in Oakland, California, after he had manhandled Grant's son Warren. In many respects this disaster was the culmination of the major misfortunes that affected the band in the mid-seventies. Grant himself was divorced from his wife Gloria after fourteen years of marriage in 1976, the singer Robert Plant and his family had suffered an almost fatal car crash, and Plant's son Karac had died.<br>
<br>These problems stopped Led Zeppelin touring and the band became ridiculed in some quarters as rock dinosaurs. Events took an even more tragic turn just before Zeppelin were to undertake a new American tour in 1980, when the drummer John Bonham died from alcohol abuse. Bonham's death led to Zeppelin's demise and Grant went into a near-terminal decline, locking himself away in his moated Sussex mansion and existing largely on cocaine&#151;which he referred to as &#145;Peruvian marching powder&#146;&#151;and Marks &amp; Spencer sandwiches and trifle.<br>
<br>When a slimmed-down Grant returned to public view in the late eighties, he had become an avuncular figure. He was by then a grandfather and was living in Eastbourne, enjoying his collections of classic cars, antique lamps, and furniture. He had no desire to return to a changed music business, although he did attend industry seminars where he entertained audiences with his tales from the past. On 21 November 1995 Grant died of a heart attack while returning to his Eastbourne home. At his funeral on 4 December his old associate Alan Callan commented that &#145;If you were his friend, then to you he would give his all&#146;  (Channel 4 television website). Grant's lasting significance was perhaps best summed up by Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers, who paid tribute to him as the first manager &#145;to make sure the artist came first and that we got paid and paid properly&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 Nov 1995).<br>
