<span class="headword">Matthews,  Zachariah Keodirelang</span>  (1901&#150;1968), <span class="occ">university teacher and political leader in South Africa</span>, was born on 20 October 1901 in his grandmother's home at Winter's Rush, near Kimberley, in the Barkly West district of Cape Colony, the second son of Motsielwa Peter (Rre-Dinku) Matthews, who had been a mine worker at Kimberley, and Martha Mooketsi (<i>d</i>. 1959), a domestic worker. Always known as Z. K. or Zac, he grew up in the house which his father built in the Kimberley African location and first attended the United Mission School in Kimberley, then the Lyndhurst Road School, from where he won a scholarship to Lovedale in the eastern Cape. He entered South African Native College, Fort Hare in 1918, and in January 1924 became the first African to obtain a BA degree from the University of South Africa (UNISA).<br>
<br>Matthews then taught at Adams College in Natal, where in 1925 he became the first African principal of the high school. He studied part-time for a law degree at UNISA and was the first African to obtain such a law degree, in 1930. He was pondering a law career when offered a scholarship to go to Yale. There in 1934 he presented a thesis entitled &#145;Bantu law and Western civilization in South Africa&#146;, for which he obtained an MA degree. Before returning to South Africa he attended B. Malinowski's famous anthropology seminar at the London School of Economics, and met Jomo Kenyatta and other future African leaders. In January 1936 he became a lecturer in social anthropology and native law at Fort Hare. Had the legislation of that year permitted black people to be members of parliament, he would probably have been elected. Instead, he stayed at Fort Hare, becoming professor and head of African studies in 1945. His varied activities included being a member of the royal commission which reported on higher education in east Africa in 1937.<br>
<br>Matthews was not only an outstanding teacher; he also did much to build up Fort Hare and served as its acting principal from 1954. But he was increasingly drawn into political activity, both as a member of the natives representative council from 1942 and in the African National Congress (ANC), after brief initial involvement in the all-African convention. He chaired the committee which drew up the key document &#145;Africans' claims&#146; which the ANC adopted in 1943, and in 1949 was elected its Cape leader. After resigning from the natives representative council in protest at government policy in 1950, he was involved in preparations for the defiance campaign, but then left to become a visiting professor at the Union Theological Seminary in New York.<br>
<br>It was as Cape leader of the ANC that in August 1953 Matthews suggested a congress of the people be called, at which a charter of rights should be drawn up. After the congress was held in 1955, he was, though acting principal of Fort Hare, arrested with others and charged with high treason. He was a dominant figure at the trial in Pretoria until the charges against him were dropped. In 1959 he boldly resigned from Fort Hare, forfeiting his pension though he was close to retirement, in protest against legislation which downgraded the institution to the status of an ethnic college and brought it under state control. Rhodes University then gave him an honorary doctorate, but in 1961, after being detained in the 1960 state of emergency, he left the country of his birth, where his enormous talent had not been used. A staunch Anglican, he spent five years in Geneva, Switzerland, working for the World Council of Churches, before in 1966 becoming Botswana's first ambassador to the United States and representative at the United Nations.<br>
<br>An urbane, affable man of great integrity and liberal views, who commanded widespread respect and exercised a moderating influence on more radical elements in the ANC in the early 1950s, Matthews remained committed to reconciliation despite all the adversities he suffered because of his colour. In 1928 he had married Frieda Bokwe (1905&#150;1997), daughter of a leading Xhosa-speaking missionary, and they had five children. One became a nurse, another a teacher, two doctors, and one a lawyer, Joe, who in 1994 became a deputy minister in South Africa's first democratic government.<br>
<br>Matthews died in Washington, DC, on 11 May 1968 and was buried in Gaborone, Botswana. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Freedom for my People</span>, completed by Monica Wilson, a fellow anthropologist, was published in 1981, and in 1996 his widow published her autobiography, <span class="italic">Remembrances</span>.<br>
