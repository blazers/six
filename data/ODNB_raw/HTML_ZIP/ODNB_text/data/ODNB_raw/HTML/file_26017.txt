<span class="headword">Somerville,  Alexander Neil</span>  (1813&#150;1889), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and evangelist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 29 January 1813, the eldest of eight children of Alexander Somerville, a wine merchant and his wife, Eliza Munro. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and Edinburgh University, where Robert Murray McCheyne became an inseparable friend. Licensed by the presbytery of Jedburgh in December 1835, he worked as a missionary at Stockbridge, Edinburgh, before succeeding McCheyne as assistant to Dr John Bonar of Larbert and Dunipace. In November 1837 he was ordained as minister of Anderston, a <i>quoad sacra</i> charge in Glasgow. His connection with this congregation was to last in various forms for the next fifty-two years. On 6 June 1841 he married Isabella Mirrlees Ewing (<i>d</i>. 1900); they had two daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>In 1843, at the Disruption of the Church of Scotland, Somerville joined the Free Church and his congregation built a new church in Cadogan Street. Like McCheyne he had felt a missionary impulse early in life, but he channelled it instead into revivals and home-mission work. There was much to do in Anderston, where drunkenness and prostitution were rife. He became home secretary of the Glasgow African Missionary Society and a director of the Glasgow Bible Society. His interest in the latter led him to become one of the founders of the National Bible Society of Scotland. His urge to travel and his skills as a propagandist were exploited by the Free Church, which sent him to Canada on its behalf in 1845. In 1848&#150;9 he went on a visit to the Holy Land. He took a great interest in the cause of protestantism in Spain, where he spent each summer for six years. He drew up a constitution and confession of faith for Spanish protestants in 1870. In the same year the ancient Scottish barony of Somerville fell vacant and Somerville was a claimant. No claim was upheld, however, and the peerage became dormant.<br>
<br>Somerville's tireless work led to a physical breakdown, but he recovered to be galvanized by the visit of the American revivalists Moody and Sankey to Scotland in 1873. He resolved to become a full-time evangelist, and went on a missionary tour in India in 1874&#150;5. He visited Canada in 1876; in the following year he formally became a missionary there and the Glasgow United Evangelistic Association released him from ministerial duties. In May 1877 he received the honorary degree of DD from Glasgow University. Thereafter he travelled to Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, South Africa, Greece, western Asia, Bohemia, Hungary, Serbia, and Romania. His practice was to preach, when necessary through an interpreter, at meetings where hymns were sung. Although understandably most effective in the English-speaking world, his gatherings in other countries invariably attracted an audience and, less often, some local opposition. Somerville's unorthodox methods and nondenominational approach did not prevent him from being honoured by his own church when, in 1886, he became moderator of the Free Church of Scotland general assembly. He was invited to address the general assembly of the established church on the question of converting the Jews, the last of his enthusiasms, in 1889. He died on 18 September 1889 at 11 South Park Terrace, Hillhead, Glasgow, and was buried nearby at the western necropolis, Maryhill.<br>
<br>Although hardly orthodox in his missionary methods, which were not confined to one continent, let alone one country, Somerville was an effective missionary who used modern evangelistic techniques. His efforts were helped by his commanding appearance: he had a tall and athletic build, a lofty brow, and a piercing eye, and his hair, bushy and black in youth, turned to a venerable, flowing white.<br>
