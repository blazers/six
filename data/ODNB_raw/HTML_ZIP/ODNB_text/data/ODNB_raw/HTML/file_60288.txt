<span class="headword">Lewis,  Sarah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1839&#150;1848) was a <span class="occ">writer on the status of women</span>, about whom no biographical information has come to light apart from a comment by T. M. Rearden in the <span class="italic">Congregational Magazine</span> of 1840 that she was &#145;a lady known in Episcopalian circles&#146;. <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span>, published anonymously in 1839 and later attributed to Sarah Lewis, is her only work, apart from a short article on governesses &#145;by the author of <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span>&#146; which appeared in volume 37 of <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> (1848), and in which she argues for government-controlled qualification by examination for governesses in order to improve their status and pay.<br>
<br>The influential <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> is loosely based on Louis Aim&eacute; Martin's 1834 work <span class="italic">De l'&eacute;ducation des m&egrave;res de famille, ou, La civilisation du genre humain par les femmes</span>. The author emerges from this work as a firm advocate of &#145;separate spheres&#146;; the book is aimed at middle-class women within the home, whose role she wishes to elevate but not extend in any public or political way. Indeed, since she views the qualities men bring to public life with distrust, and traces their selfishness and competitive temper to inadequate schooling, nothing would be gained, in her view, by allowing women to develop similar characteristics. Instead, she argues that while girls are trained in self-control, submission, and service to others, boys are given a predominantly intellectual training devoid of moral content, with the result that men become &#145;selfish husbands and tyrannical fathers&#146;. The remedy for this lies in the moral influence of the Christian mother exerted within the home, which Lewis sees as balancing and ameliorating male power, and she wants boys to remain under the influence of such a mother for as long as possible. She also suggests that female moral influence will have its effect on the wider world, and will ultimately improve social and political attitudes. Her arguments both on influence and education are closely similar to those of Sarah Stickney Ellis, who comments approvingly on <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> in the last of her four books on conduct, <span class="italic">The Mothers of England, their Influence and Responsibility</span> (1843). Both these highly popular writers started from a belief in the moral equality of men and women, but Lewis directly argues against the advocates of &#145;women's rights&#146;, in the belief that women would only antagonize men by claiming the right to vote. Like Ellis, she also argues that women should be allowed to take paid employment without loss of caste, because marriage, as a moral enterprise, should not be entered into simply because a woman cannot afford to keep herself; hence the paradox that arguments elevating the role of the married woman also logically tended to support paid employment for the single.<br>
<br>The reassuringly moderate ideology of <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> was well received by reviewers for journals usually on opposite sides of the debates on the question of women, and stimulated considerable discussion, while on a more light-hearted note <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> pretensions, seen as manipulative self-promotion, were frequently burlesqued in <span class="italic">Punch</span> throughout the 1840s. Serious analysis of the weaknesses in Lewis's position began when Anna Jameson, in an article in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in 1843, pointed out the inapplicability of <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> ideology to the masses of labouring women, and in the same year Marion Reid published <span class="italic">A Plea for Woman</span>, in which, taking <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> as a starting point, she argued powerfully for women's right to the franchise. On education she also rejected Lewis's position, arguing that women should primarily be educated for their own benefit.<br>
<br>The very moderation of Lewis's position with regard to political rights for women seems to have helped the dissemination of her ideas, which stimulated debate, and explained how far the position of women could be improved without a more radical programme such as that advocated by Reid.<br>
