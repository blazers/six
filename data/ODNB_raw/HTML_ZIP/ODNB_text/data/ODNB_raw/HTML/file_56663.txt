<span class="headword">Cohen,  Hannah Floretta</span>  (1875&#150;1946), <span class="occ">philanthropist and civil servant</span>, was born at 63 Queen's Gardens, Kensington, London, on 25 May 1875, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59288/', "Sir Benjamin Louis Cohen, baronet (1844&#150;1909)")</script>. Her father was a great-grandson of Levi Barent Cohen, an Amsterdam merchant who had settled in London in the late eighteenth century, and whose twelve children formed the backbone of &#145;the cousinhood&#146;&#151;the network of wealthy families which provided the lay leadership of Anglo-Jewry until the mid-twentieth century. Her mother, Louisa Emily Merton (1850&#150;1931), was also a great-grandchild of Levi Barent Cohen. Benjamin Cohen, besides being a stockbroker, was active both in party politics (he sat as Conservative MP for East Islington from 1892 to 1906) and in Anglo-Jewish affairs, serving as president of the Board of Guardians for the Relief of the Jewish Poor from 1887 to 1900. Hannah Cohen thus grew up in an opulent Anglo-Jewish milieu in which it was accepted that members of the dominant families would assume the burdens of communal leadership. In <span class="italic">Changing Faces</span>, a memoir of her mother which she published in 1937, she offered a sympathetic insight into this world in which affluence and leisure existed naturally alongside persistent philanthropy and public service.<br>
<br>Hannah Cohen was educated at Roedean School and Newnham College, Cambridge (1894&#150;7), where she read for the classical tripos. Though of independent means, during the First World War she accepted employment in the factory department of the Home Office (1916&#150;17), from where she moved to the Treasury (1917&#150;20), becoming one of the first women to be entrusted with senior employment in the civil service; her work at the Treasury earned her an OBE. At that time the presidency of the Jewish Board of Guardians was held by her cousin, Sir Lionel Cohen, who had succeeded her father in that office. Established in 1859, the board of guardians had been regarded as a model of good practice in relation to voluntary poor relief, which in time extended also to financing schemes of apprenticeship and to providing loans and grants to enable impoverished Jewish immigrants to learn suitable trades. But the large-scale influx of Russian-Jewish refugees in the 1880s and 1890s had led it to adopt, under the influence of Sir Benjamin Cohen and other members of the Anglo-Jewish establishment, a series of highly unpopular panic-induced policies, including repatriation; Sir Benjamin himself had incurred considerable communal opprobrium by offering parliamentary support for the 1905 <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span>.<br>
<br>In 1900 Hannah Cohen had become the first woman to be elected a member of the board of guardians; over the next twenty years she familiarized herself with every aspect of its work. In 1921 she became the guardians' honorary secretary, succeeding to the vice-presidency in 1926; she held the presidency itself from 1930 to 1940. In the case of each of these offices, she was the first female incumbent. The revival of the reputation of the guardians was due in no small measure to Hannah Cohen's exertions. A brilliant administrator, she brought the guardians back to an appreciation of their original philosophy, arguing that the prevention of poverty was better than its cure, and emphasizing the importance of health and the value of convalescence. In the nineteenth century the Anglo-Jewish leadership had vigorously opposed any reliance on financial assistance from the state to help cope with the problems of the Jewish poor. Hannah Cohen had no such inhibitions: in 1929 she made, on behalf of the guardians, its first radio broadcast appeal for funds. Under her leadership the guardians took full advantage of the financial benefits of the rudimentary welfare state then in existence, covering sickness, unemployment, and old-age benefits. These were supplemented as necessary, but the major focus of the guardians was readjusted to concentrate on housing schemes, the provision of health services, and the expansion of convalescent facilities, especially for women and children.<br>
<br>Hannah Cohen served on the governing bodies of Roedean and Newnham, the Working Women's College, London, Swanley Horticultural College, and the Jewish Orphanage, Norwood. She never married. She died of gangrene in Stoneycrest Nursing Home in Hindhead, Surrey, on 21 November 1946.<br>
