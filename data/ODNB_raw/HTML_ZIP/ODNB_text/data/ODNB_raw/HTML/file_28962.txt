<span class="headword">Wedderburn,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1553), <span class="occ">reformer and poet</span>, was born in Dundee, the eldest son of James Wedderburn (<i>d</i>. 1514?), merchant &#145;at the West Kirk stile&#146; in Dundee, and Janet Barrie. He matriculated at St Andrews University in 1514 and studied under Gavin Logie, a leading reformer of the time. He left the university without taking his bachelor's degree and travelled to France, where he worked as a merchant in Rouen and Dieppe. It is possible that he was the same James Wedderburn who some time before 1528 married Janet Forrester of Nevay, daughter of David Forrester, and had three children with her.<br>
<br>On his return to Dundee, Wedderburn took religious instruction from James Hewat, a Dominican friar who strengthened James's reforming convictions. James had two plays performed in the burgh in 1539&#150;40, though there are no extant texts of these. <span class="italic">The Beheading of Johne the Baptist</span>, a tragedy, was staged at the West Port in Dundee, and <span class="italic">The Historie of Dyonisius the Tyrant</span>, a comedy, was staged at the burgh playfield. Both plays strongly attacked Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>It was probably around this time that Wedderburn began composing poems that promoted protestant doctrine and denounced Roman Catholic corruption. These, along with works by his brothers <a href="#cosubject_28958">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_28962">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were to form a substantial part of the collection now generally known as <span class="italic">The Gude and Godlie Ballatis</span> but titled, in the 1578 edition, <span class="italic">Ane Compendious Buik of Godlie and Spirituall Songs</span>. The collection is made up of translations of scripture into Scots, satirical pieces, and adaptations of popular song which turn them to the service of the reformers in promoting protestant doctrine and attacking Roman Catholic corruption. The title-page of the 1578 edition announces that it contains &#145;an augmentation of sundrie gude and godlie Ballates not contenit in the first edition&#146;. The only known previous edition is from 1567, but this contains only five pieces fewer than the 1578 edition. It is thus probable that an earlier edition existed, but no trace of it has been found. Topical allusions in some of the songs indicate that they were composed about 1540, and they may have been circulated in pamphlet form in the 1540s. The collection undoubtedly includes pieces not by the Wedderburn brothers, and exactly which poems were composed by which brother is unclear.<br>
<br>There are only five extant copies of the four known early editions of the Wedderburns' collection. These were published in 1567, 1578, 1600, and 1621, an indication of the influence and continuing popularity of the <span class="italic">Ballatis</span> in post-Reformation Scotland. As Helena Shire has noted, while the collection's adaptations of popular song aim at displacing these secular pieces, they have in fact helped to preserve many from oblivion  (Shire, 33). In 1540 James Wedderburn was delated to James V for having counterfeited the conjuring of a ghost. This alluded to a similar summoning enacted at Kinghorn by one Friar Walter Laing, who had been confessor to the king. James Wedderburn fled to France to avoid arrest and once more took up commerce in Rouen and Dieppe. Other Scottish merchants at Dieppe informed the bishop at Rouen that Wedderburn had been declared a heretic in Scotland, but no action was taken. He remained at Rouen and Dieppe until his death, which appears to have been in 1553, since in this year his son, John (<i>d</i>. November 1569), was declared his heir. On his deathbed James is reported to have said to his son &#145;We have beene acting our part in the theater: you are to succeed; see that you act your part faithfullie!&#146;  (Calderwood, 1.142).<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_28958"></a><span class="headword">John Wedderburn</span>  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1556)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son of James Wedderburn and Janet Barrie, was born in Dundee. He was incorporated in 1525 into the pedagogium (later St Mary's College) at St Andrews University when Patrick Hamilton and George Buchanan were residing there and John Major was lecturing in theology. He may have studied earlier at St Leonard's College under Gavin Logie. Wedderburn graduated BA in 1526 and MA in 1528. He returned to Dundee to join the priesthood, and he too received religious instruction from the Dominican James Hewat. In 1532 he is mentioned as chaplain of St Matthew's Chapel in Dundee.<br>
<br>In 1538&#150;9 John Wedderburn fled to the continent after being accused and convicted of heresy, though it is unclear whether or not he actually stood trial. A king's messenger was sent to Dundee in 1538&#150;9 to search his goods, suggesting that the trial and flight took place in early 1539. His possessions were seized by the crown and passed on to his youngest brother, Henry, for a small payment. Wedderburn took shelter in Wittenberg, an important protestant centre, where he encountered both Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. It is possible that the name Joannes Scotus entered in Wittenberg University's register in 1539 refers to John Wedderburn. The time he spent in Wittenberg suggests that he is responsible for the many poems in <span class="italic">The Gude and Godlie Ballatis</span> that are based on German sources and on Luther's verses.<br>
<br>John Wedderburn returned to Dundee in early 1543, after the death of James V, when the appointment of the supposedly pro-Reformation James Hamilton, earl of Arran, as regent gave the reformers hope that the authorities were now prepared to show greater tolerance towards protestantism. Wedderburn joined with a Dundee printer, John Scot, in publishing pro-Reformation works, these probably being the earliest editions of the works contained in <span class="italic">The Gude and Godlie Ballatis</span>. Later in 1543 an act of privy council was issued declaring that printers should destroy any slanderous ballads and works of condemned heretics. John Scot was ordered to be arrested, no doubt largely because of his role in disseminating the <span class="italic">Ballatis</span>, but the order was not carried out. In 1546, presumably as a result of the state's renewed attempts to suppress pro-Reformation writings, Wedderburn was forced to flee to England for his own safety, and he remained there until his death in 1556.<br>
<br>Another brother, <a name="cosubject_28962"></a><span class="headword">Robert Wedderburn</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1555<span class="mult">x</span>60)<span class="occ"></span>, the third son of James Wedderburn and Janet Barrie, was born in Dundee, and also attended St Andrews University. Having entered St Leonard's College in 1526 he graduated BA in 1529 and MA in 1530, with his name listed at the head of the roll of graduates. In 1528 he was granted the reversion of St Katherine's Chapel in Dundee, despite being under age. In the mid-1530s he came under suspicion of heresy and fled to Paris, where he attended the university. He may also have spent some time with his brother John at Wittenberg in the 1540s, a suggestion given credence by the fact that on his return journey to Scotland in 1546 he embarked at Frankfurt an der Oder. Crawford relates that when Robert was journeying back to Scotland and his ship had put in on the coast of Norway, a dispute arose between the Roman Catholic and protestant passengers, which led Robert and his fellow reformers to burn Cardinal David Beaton in effigy. Beaton was assassinated in St Andrews that same day. Robert succeeded his uncle, John Barry, as vicar of Dundee in 1546. He remained in this post until his death, in Dundee, some time between 1555 and 1560. With Isobel Lovell he had two illegitimate sons, David and Robert, who were declared legitimate in 1552&#150;3. Isobel Lovell married David Cant in 1560 and had died by 1587. It has been suggested that Robert Wedderburn was the author of <span class="italic">The Complaynt of Scotland</span> (1548), but that work's positive attitudes towards the established church make it unlikely that the ascription is accurate.<br>
