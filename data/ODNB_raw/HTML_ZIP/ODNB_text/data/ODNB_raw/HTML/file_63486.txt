<span class="headword">Beechey,  Henry William</span>  (1788/9&#150;1862), <span class="occ">painter and explorer</span>, was born probably at 37 Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, the eldest son of the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1949/', "Sir William Beechey (1753&#150;1839)")</script> and his first wife. Nothing is known of his education. In August 1815 he became secretary to Henry Salt, the newly appointed British consul-general in Egypt, who commented that he drew well and understood both French and Italian. In 1817 he was sent by Salt to oversee the excavations of Giovanni Belzoni at Thebes and to make drawings of the monuments, including the interior of the newly discovered tomb of Seti I. He joined Belzoni and captains Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles in digging out the buried temple of Abu Simbel, and some of his drawings illustrate this section of the captains' account of their travels. In 1818&#150;19 he accompanied Salt and William John Bankes to Abu Simbel and, with Bankes, made an unsuccessful attempt to reach Meroe in upper Nubia. Recalled to England by his father, he left Egypt in October 1819.<br>
<br>During 1821&#150;2, having been appointed by Earl Bathurst for the Colonial Office, Beechey and his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1946/', "Lieutenant Frederick William Beechey RN (1796&#150;1856)")</script>, surveyed the coastline of north Africa from Tripoli to Darnah. Henry's part was to examine and report on the antiquities of Cyrenaica, and he illustrated the chronicle of the expedition published by the brothers in 1828. He became an FSA in 1825. At the Royal Academy in 1829 he exhibited a seascape, and in 1838 a portrait of Mrs Worthington; another seascape was shown at the British Institution in 1838. He wrote a painstaking and thoughtful memoir of Sir Joshua Reynolds to preface the 1835 edition of Reynolds's <span class="italic">Literary Works</span>.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1824 Beechey married Maria Frost. His wife died, and on 23 August 1834 he married Harriet Eyres (1809/10&#150;1864); there were children of both marriages. Apparently beset by vicissitudes in England, at the age of sixty-one and accompanied by Harriet, four of his children, and a daughter-in-law, he emigrated to New Zealand in the <i>Castle Eden</i>, arriving there on 7 February 1851. He took up land and farmed it at Governors Bay, Lyttleton, near Christchurch, where he died of pulmonary congestion on 4 August 1862. He was buried in the cemetery at Lyttleton on 7 August.<br>
<br>Beechey's half-brother, <a name="cosubject_63486"></a><span class="headword">Richard Brydges Beechey</span>  (1808&#150;1895), <span class="occ">marine painter and naval officer</span>, was born on 17 May 1808, probably at 13 Harley Street, Cavendish Square, London, the youngest son of Sir William Beechey and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75533/', "Anne Phyllis Beechey, n&#233;e Jessop (1764&#150;1833)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1949/', "Beechey, Sir William")</script>], who was herself a painter of miniatures. He entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, on 1 March 1821. From March 1825 to September 1828, as a midshipman in HMS <i>Blossom</i> commanded by his brother, Captain Frederick William Beechey, he was on a voyage of discovery in the south seas and north to the Bering Strait in an attempt to re-provision Captain John Franklin's polar expedition. Richard provided two illustrations to Frederick's account of the voyage. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1947/', "George Beechey")</script> was also a painter.<br>
<br>Promoted lieutenant on 15 September 1828, Richard Beechey was from then, as he wrote in 1844, &#145;except for three years when ill health prevented me &hellip; constantly in active service of some shape or other&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 38039/446). In 1835 he was appointed to the survey service in Ireland, in which he remained until put on half pay in 1857. He was promoted commander on 31 March 1846 and captain on 1 January 1857. Although he retired on 2 July 1864, he became an admiral, on seniority, on 31 March 1885. He married Frideswaide, daughter of Robert Smyth of Portlich Castle, co. Westmeath, Ireland.<br>
<br>From 1832 to 1877 Richard Beechey exhibited seascapes nearly every year at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, or the Suffolk Street Gallery, London. His retirement enabled him to concentrate on his art, and during that time he often worked up sketches made during his naval service. Brook-Hart says of him that he was of &#145;quite considerable talent and competence&#146;  (Brook-Hart, 339); according to Archibald, &#145;the best painter the navy ever produced&#146;  (Archibald, 65). Richard Beechey died at his home, 9 Portland Terrace, Southsea, Hampshire, on 8 March 1895.<br>
