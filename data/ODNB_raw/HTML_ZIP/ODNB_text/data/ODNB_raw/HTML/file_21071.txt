<span class="headword">Packe,  Christopher</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1657, <em>d.</em> in or after 1708), <span class="occ">chemical physician</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21070/', "Sir Christopher Packe (c.1599&#150;1682)")</script>, a woollen merchant, who was lord mayor of London during part of the Commonwealth, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1658), eldest daughter of Simon Edmonds, alderman of London. Packe set up his laboratory in 1670 at the sign of the Globe and Chemical Furnaces in Little Moorfields, London, and styled himself a professor of chemical medicine. He supposedly practised as a quack under powerful patronage, including that of Robert Boyle and the king's physician, Edmund Dickinson, though there is little to confirm this; in 1684 he circulated a list of his specifics.<br>
<br>In 1689 Packe brought out in folio his translation of Glauber's writings, which he published as <span class="italic">Works of the Highly Experienced and Famous Chymist, John Rudolph Glauber</span>, accompanied by the original copperplates, which he had purchased at Amsterdam. This task occupied him for three years, and he secured a large number of subscribers. He must have been an able Latin scholar as the translation reads very well. Packe also included a great deal of scarce German material by Glauber, but for the translation of this, he says, he relied upon a friend. His other publications were chiefly designed to promote the sale of his specifics. They include <span class="italic">One Hundred and Fifty Three Chymical Aphorisms</span> (1688); <span class="italic">Mineralogia, or, An account of the preparation, manifold vertues, and uses of a mineral salt, both in physick and chyrurgery</span> (1693); and <span class="italic">Medela chymica, or, An account of the vertues and uses of a select number of chymical medicines</span> (1708), at the end of which is a catalogue of his medicines, with their prices.<br>
<br>Little is known of Packe's private life. He appears to have been married, as he had at least one son&#151;<a href="#cosubject_21074">Edmund Packe [<i>see below</i>]</a> who inherited the business; the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21072/', "Christopher Packe (1686&#150;1749)")</script> was probably also his son. The details of his death and burial are obscure.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_21074"></a><span class="headword">Edmund Packe</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1735) carried on the business at the Golden Head in Southampton Street, Covent Garden, calling himself &#145;M.D. and <span class="occ">chemist</span>&#146;. He published an edition of his father's <span class="italic">Mineralogia</span> (n.d. [1730?]) and <span class="italic">An answer to Dr Turner's letter to Dr Jurin on the subject of Mr Ward's drop and pill, wherein his ignorance of chymical pharmacy is fairly exposed</span> (1735).<br>
