<span class="headword">Bizzarri <span class="st"> [Bizari]</span>,  Pietro</span>  (<em>b. </em>1525, <em>d.</em> in or after 1586), <span class="occ">historian and spy</span>, was born probably in Sassoferrato Castello (Marche), Italy, the son of Antonio Bizzarri, a soldier who died in 1528. He must also have lived in Perugia, hence his common description as <i>Perusinus</i>. He was sent to Venice for an excellent education in classical letters. There in his eighteenth year (1542&#150;3) he was converted to protestantism, perhaps under the influence of Bernardino Ochino and the writings of Erasmus. Now devoted to evangelical reform, Bizzarri left Italy in the summer of 1545 for Germany, settling first in Nuremberg, and then in Wittenberg, where he sought his spiritual guide, Philip Melanchthon, with whom he planned to study. However, Charles V's victory at Muhlberg (1547) resulted in Bizzarri abandoning Germany, and after stopping briefly at several German universities he eventually crossed the channel to England, where he was resident from 1549.<br>
<br>What drove Bizzarri to England is unknown, although it is probable that other Italians who had adopted reformed beliefs, such as Ochino and Pietro Martire Vermigli, and the German Martin Bucer, had much to do with his decision. The intervention of powerful friends is clear from the young man's career: in July 1549 he was named a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, by the royal visitors. This appointment was, however, brief. The death of Bucer in February 1551 and Bizzarri's increasingly close relations with Francis Russell resulted in his resigning his fellowship to follow Russell to court, perhaps as his secretary and Italian tutor, hoping to build a career as a poet and courtier. Unfortunately, the death of the king and the accession of Mary exploded Bizzarri's ambitions and drove him back to the continent.<br>
<br>Bizzarri next appears in Venice in December 1558 complimenting Elizabeth I on her accession. Subsequently he returned to England, where he dedicated a beautiful manuscript, <span class="italic">De principe tractatus</span>, to the queen. In return for this treatise&#151;essentially a collection of commonplaces on the ideal ruler, heavily influenced by Erasmian eirenic principles&#151;he received a pension from the crown and the living of Alton Pancras, Dorset, from Bishop Jewel of Salisbury, through the mediation of Archbishop Parker, whom Bizzarri had certainly known at Cambridge. Moreover, he seems to have re-established his connection with Russell, now earl of Bedford. In February 1564 Bedford was appointed governor of Berwick and took Bizzarri north with him. Consequently, Bizzarri became associated with the court of Mary Stuart, and in the hope of acquiring the patronage of the Scottish queen as well he presented to her a Latin treatise, <span class="italic">De bello et pace</span>. This is a much more original tract than the one which he presented to Elizabeth. Bizzarri had himself seen and experienced the effects of civil and foreign conflict, both in England and on the continent, and this gives urgency to his discussion of the horrors that result from war. Peace, he argues, should be the highest ambition of any ruler, since peace is Christ's message. War, by contrast, is an affront to God, causing true religion to be neglected and making resistance to the Turks impossible.<br>
<br>For some reason Bizzarri left Scotland almost immediately afterwards, requesting permission from William Cecil on 12 June 1564 to settle on the continent with the continuation of his pension. That summer he left for Venice, but stopped for the autumn in Padua, where he engaged in informal studies. It is also at this time that Bizzarri began his lifelong career as an intelligencer, passing political and diplomatic information to Cecil. Although there is no clear evidence, it is possible that Bizzarri had been used at the Scottish court as an agent, and that it was Cecil who encouraged him to settle in Venice to collect and transmit information at a time when no Venetian ambassador was resident in England.<br>
<br>Bizzarri also frequented the literary circles of Venice. He solicited poems in praise of Elizabeth for his first volume, <span class="italic">Varia opuscula</span>, printed by Aldus in 1565, which not only contained his earlier poems to English courtiers but also included the works dedicated to Elizabeth and Mary Stuart. Also, in 1566 Bizzarri edited and had printed <span class="italic">La santa</span>, a comedy by his fellow Italian exile in England, Mario Cardoini. This productive period in Venice also included the completion of his <span class="italic">Historia della guerra fatta in Ungheria</span>, which follows the events of the current Turkish-imperial confrontation in Hungary, written in an almost journalistic style.<br>
<br>Bizzarri, however, fled Venice almost immediately afterwards, and had the book printed at Lyons in 1568, dedicated to Bedford. Perhaps a warning from the Inquisition forced him from Italy, or Cecil may have ordered his return as a result of the flight to England of Mary Stuart, whom Bizzarri had praised and briefly served. From April 1570 until August 1572 Bizzarri was again in England, apparently in the service of Bedford. During his absence from Venice he seems to have arranged for another informer, della Roche, to send reports on European affairs, implying that he managed information for Cecil as well as collecting it. Leaving England again for Venice, Bizzarri travelled by way of Paris and found himself in danger that August during the St Bartholomew's day massacre. He sought refuge with the English ambassador, Sir Francis Walsingham, beginning a lasting association not only with the ambassador but also with Hubert Languet, and through him with Philip Sidney, with whom Bizzarri would engage in correspondence.<br>
<br>Once safely able to flee Paris, Bizzarri travelled to Basel, where he had printed by February 1573 a work prepared in London, his <span class="italic">Cyprium bellum</span>&#151;Cyprus had just been conquered by the Turks. To this he added a Latin translation of his earlier history of the Hungarian war, now entitled <span class="italic">Pannonicum bellum</span>, which he dedicated to the Elector August of Saxony, probably on the advice of his new friend, Languet, who was August's representative in Paris. Bizzarri then travelled to Dresden, where the elector honoured him with an annual pension of 100 thalers.<br>
<br>Bizzarri then began to function as an intelligencer for August of Saxony as well, with a first report from Augsburg sent in April. In September 1573 Bizzarri's pension was increased by 50 thalers, and the Italian enjoyed a comfortable, secure income for the first time, acquiring a large house in Nuremberg. He even attempted to arrange a marriage with the eighteen-year-old daughter of his former fellow Italian protestant exile in England, Pietro Martire Vermigli, although the negotiations failed.<br>
<br>Bizzarri remained in Augsburg until early 1576 when he is found in Cologne. Beginning in 1575&#150;6 he also sent intelligence reports to Walsingham, a practice he continued for the rest of his career. Although Cecil still received reports, they became less frequent than those to Walsingham or August. From his base in Cologne, Bizzarri travelled widely in Germany, but by January 1578 he was established in Antwerp, where he frequented the circle of the printer Christopher Plantin. It was Plantin who in 1579 printed Bizzarri's most ambitious work, his immense history of Genoa (<span class="italic">Senatus populique Genuensis &hellip; historiae atque annales</span>). Unfortunately, despite having personally presented his work, Bizzarri was refused any reward. The senate had been prejudiced against the history by Uberto Foglietta, the city's official historian, who denounced its style and suggested parts were heretical. Although he importuned the republic for years after, Bizzarri received nothing for this monumental piece of scholarship, which was later placed on the index of prohibited books.<br>
<br>Despite this failure, Bizzarri continued to write histories for Plantin's press. In 1583 appeared his Persian history, <span class="italic">Rerum Persicarum historia</span>, dedicated to August of Saxony, although two presentation copies were also sent to England: one for the queen and one for Walsingham. Bizzarri left for Dresden to present the book, and narrowly escaped death when his ship was captured on the Rhine by Catholic soldiers. Nevertheless, the voyage was a success: August generously granted Bizzarri 100 thalers and increased his pension. On 11 July he returned to Antwerp, where he produced his last work, <span class="italic">De quattuor monarchiis</span>, and sent it to Frankfurt for printing. Unfortunately, the work was lost and no trace of it remains.<br>
<br>In August 1585, although very ill, Bizzarri was forced to flee the Spanish armies of Alessandro Farnese, first to Dordrecht and then to England, where he was resident by February 1586; but the death of August of Saxony in that year drew him back to Dresden to plead for continuation of his pension. From Saxony Bizzarri returned to the Netherlands, where from The Hague on 23 November 1586 he wrote his last letter to Cecil. He must have died soon after, since no further trace of him survives.<br>
