<span class="headword">Fowler,  George Herbert</span>  (1861&#150;1940), <span class="occ">zoologist and historian</span>, was born in Lincoln on 4 September 1861, the only child of the Revd John Fowler (1823/4&#150;1902), headmaster of Lincoln grammar school, and his wife, Martha Bodley, daughter of William Hulme Bodley, a Brighton medical practitioner, and sister of the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31944/', "George Frederick Bodley (1827&#150;1907)")</script>. Fowler was educated at Marlborough College, where his father had taught, and then at Eton College, as a king's scholar. In 1880 he entered Keble College, Oxford. The lectures of H. N. Moseley inspired him to turn to zoology in his final year and he obtained his BA with second-class honours in natural science in 1884. From 1884 to 1887 he held a Berkeley fellowship at the University of Manchester. For part of this time he studied under Rudolf Leuckart at Leipzig, obtaining a PhD for research on coral. On 20 August 1885 Fowler married Ursula Mary Dewes (1867&#150;1912), but the marriage was not a success and the couple separated on 8 September 1892.<br>
<br>Between 1887 and 1889 Fowler acted as assistant to E. Ray Lankester at University College, London. He also taught zoology at Royal Holloway College in 1888 and 1891. The summers of 1889 and 1890 were spent in research at the recently founded Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, and in 1890 he acted as interim director for six months at a difficult period in the institution's history (following the resignation of G. C. Bourne). He acted as the association's secretary until 1895.<br>
<br>In January 1891 Fowler returned to University College as an assistant, and later assistant professor of zoology, under W. F. R. Weldon who spoke highly of his energy and capability, but the routine work of the department left Fowler little time for independent research. A problem then attracting much attention in marine zoology was Alexander Agassiz's theory that plankton occurred only in the surface and deepest waters of the ocean, and not in the intermediate layers. Fowler designed a self-closing plankton net and in 1896 and 1897, and again in 1900, made cruises in HM survey ship <i>Research</i> to try it out. The results led him to propose some interesting ideas on plankton distribution but he was unable to obtain the sea time needed to develop them further.<br>
<br>As a zoologist Fowler was seen as competent rather than brilliant, and when Weldon left for Oxford in 1899 Fowler was passed over in favour of E. A. Minchin. These factors, and the onset of eye strain, contributed to his decision to resign from his University College post in 1909. Fowler's enduring legacy to marine science was the Challenger Society, founded with R. Norris Wolfenden in 1903, which he ran as secretary until 1910, also editing the society's influential publication <span class="italic">Science of the Sea</span> (1912). He continued to be a force in the society, not always for the good, as he campaigned against the admission of women as members.<br>
<br>After his retirement Fowler lived at the Old House at Aspley Guise in Bedfordshire. Its restoration led him to the study of local history which became the dominant passion of the second half of his life. In 1912 he founded the Bedfordshire Historical Record Society to publish sources (mainly medieval) for the county's history. He served as chairman of the county records committee (1913&#150;40) and was instrumental in the setting up of the British Records Association in 1932. This work was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, for the duration of which he worked as a voluntary assistant in the hydrographic and naval intelligence departments of the Admiralty. His main task was preparing charts for use by submarines, covering such topics as currents and tidal streams, bathymetry, seasonal variations in density (which affected the operation of sonar), ice movements, North Sea wrecks, and coastal defences. He published <span class="italic">Charts: their Use and Meaning</span> in 1916. When the war ended he recommended that the hydrographic department should undertake oceanographic research because of its naval applications. Though his ideas were not fully adopted, some marine research was undertaken by the navy during the inter-war period as a result of this initiative.<br>
<br>Fowler declined the offer of a knighthood for his wartime services, but was made a CBE in 1918. After recovering from a breakdown due to overwork he returned to historical research. His output was prolific: the <span class="italic">Bedfordshire Bibliography</span> by L. R. Conisbee (1962) has no fewer than thirty-three references to editions of medieval sources and historical articles on related themes. These included a magnificent analysis and synthesis, begun during the war, of the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> for Bedfordshire (1922) and a fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Sheriff's Roll</span> (1929). Fowler was also concerned with the wider aspects of the subject and wrote <span class="italic">The Care of County Muniments</span> (1923), &#145;for long the only textbook in the field&#146;  (Bell, 160). As chairman of the county records committee he was responsible for setting up the Bedfordshire Record Office which became a model for local record offices elsewhere. He stood for the county council, becoming an alderman, and also helped develop the county library service.<br>
<br>Fowler was a man of enormous energy and diverse interests. He was a winter sports enthusiast and made regular visits to the Alps. He published a book on the history of skating, <span class="italic">On the Outside Edge</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">Notes on the Early History of Ski</span> (1909). He enjoyed working with his hands. When advised to rest from intellectual work after the war he took up silversmithing and he listed his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as gardening and the repair of manuscripts. In his later years he still regularly spent two days a week at the Bedfordshire Record Office. He died at the Old House, Aspley Guise, on 15 August 1940 and was cremated. He left the residue of his estate to fund studies in Old Icelandic at Oxford University.<br>
