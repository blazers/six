<span class="headword">Torday,  Emil</span>  (1875&#150;1931), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 22 June 1875. His family were landowners, with estates in the town of Torda which subsequently, with boundary changes, became part of Romania. Little is known of his early life or his education, which he received in both Hungary and Germany. He was enrolled as a student at the University of Munich, but left without completing his degree and moved to Brussels where he worked for a time in a bank. Torday was an excellent linguist who learned to speak fifteen languages, eight of them African, and had already developed the engaging, maverick personality which became apparent in his later activities and in his more popular writing.<br>
<br>Torday's reputation rests largely on his experiences in equatorial Africa, where he travelled and worked almost continuously from 1900 to 1910. He first took up a colonial administrative post at Lake Mweru in the south-east of Congo Free State. He had few formal duties and spent his time learning local dialects and developing an interest in Luba culture. In 1904 his appointment came to an end and he voyaged back to Europe, but sought a way of returning to central Africa at the earliest opportunity. On a visit to London he met Thomas Athol Joyce, a curator at the British Museum, and formed an association with this institution which influenced his whole career. When he returned to the Belgian Congo&#151;this time as an employee of the Compagnie du Kasai, and later when mounting his own expedition in 1907&#151;he increasingly came to act as an agent of the British Museum. In this capacity he undertook ethnographic surveys of the people of the Kwango-Kwilu river basin and of the Kasai, formed comprehensive ethnographic collections, and created photographic and phonographic records. Over 3000 objects collected by Torday are now in the British Museum collections.<br>
<br>The centre point of Torday's ethnographic work was his engagement with the Kuba peoples, and especially his relationship with the nyimi (king) Kot aPe (or Kwete in Torday's spelling). Always an advocate of indigenous views, Torday found in the Kuba a sophisticated kingdom with a sumptuous artistic tradition, and in Kot aPe an impressive ruler. Furthermore, the Kuba had a dynastic history which could be related to European chronologies: it was founded in the early seventeenth century, dated in oral tradition to a known passage of Halley's comet. In Congo, the very heart of Conrad's &#145;heart of darkness&#146;, Torday believed he had &#145;discovered&#146; a kingdom on a parallel with European dynasties. &#145;Have the staff of police at the British Museum been doubled to keep out the publishers?&#146;, he wrote to enquire of Joyce  (letter, 1909). Here was a culture to overthrow many western stereotypes.<br>
<br>When he returned to Europe in 1909 Torday began publicizing his expedition's achievements. He was awarded the imperial gold medal for science and art by the emperor of Austria in 1910. In 1913 he spent several months as a lecturer and curator in Philadelphia, but based himself mainly in London. A series of articles, monographs, and popular books appeared, of which the best-known was <span class="italic">On the Trail of the Bushongo</span> (1925). On 17 March 1910 Torday married Gaia Rose Macdonald (<i>b</i>. 1884/5), a Scotswoman, and had a daughter, Ursula (1912&#150;1997), who subsequently became a romantic novelist under the pseudonym, among others, of Paula Allardyce. A medical career at the London Hospital was cut short by the outbreak of war, during which Torday engaged in relief work for prisoners of war. He subsequently continued as an anthropologist through his writing, his involvement with the International African Institute, the Royal Anthropological Institute, and Save the Children International. His last substantial work was another ethnographic survey, <span class="italic">Descriptive Sociology: African Races</span> (1930). Torday died in London on 9 May 1931 of heart failure, following an operation, at the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, close to the British Museum.<br>
<br>Torday's influence on subsequent anthropology has not been extensive. He held no formal position, and was not interested in big theories, like his contemporary and adversary Leo Frobenius. Yet the extent and value of his documentary work on the cultures of Congo remains a primary point of reference. An exhibition of his collection at the Museum of Mankind, London (part of the British Museum), in 1990 attracted new attention to his work. His photographic archive is divided between the latter depository and the Royal Anthropological Institute, which is the custodian of his manuscripts.<br>
