<span class="headword">Terry,  Arthur Hubert</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">translator and scholar of Catalan, Spanish, and comparative literature</span>, was born on 17 February 1927 at 25 Grosvenor Terrace, York, the son of Arthur Terry, insurance official, and his wife, Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hardisty. He was educated at St Peter's School, York, before gaining first-class honours in Spanish and French at Trinity Hall, Cambridge (1944&#150;7), a university with which he was to remain singularly unimpressed. After two years' military service he spent time researching in Barcelona with an informal fellowship provided by the exiled nationalist politician J. M. Batista i Roca before beginning his academic career in 1950 as an associate lecturer in Spanish at Queen's University, Belfast. On 25 June 1955 he married Mary Gordon (Molly) Sellar, a thirty-year-old librarian, and daughter of John Sellar, physician; they had one daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>It was at Queen's, under the influence of his professor, Ignasi Gonz&aacute;lez Llubera, that Terry was encouraged to pursue his interest in things Catalan and to acquaint himself fully with the culture and language of a nation that had disappeared under the jackboot of the Franco dictatorship. The result was a ground-breaking monograph on Joan Maragall which, from its publication in 1963, was to revolutionize not only appreciation of the poet but also the assimilation of contemporary Catalan verse in general. In due course a similar series of seminal studies would not only consolidate the reputation of such giants of Catalan letters as Carles Riba, J. V. Foix, Salvador Espriu, Joan Brossa, Gabriel Ferrater, Ramon Xirau, and Pere Gimferrer but also establish a very particular way of viewing them based squarely on the precepts of a sensitive and informed reading of the text.<br>
<br>Terry's interests, however, were by no means narrow. His voracious appetite for poetry had given rise to a dynamic participation in debates on the Spanish Renaissance and baroque which, after he had succeeded Llubera to the chair in 1962, bore fruit in his acclaimed two-volume anthology of the verse of the period (1965&#150;9), enlarged and updated in 1993 in the form of his <span class="italic">Seventeenth-century Spanish Poetry</span>, which extended the scope of his earlier edition. His contribution to the appreciation of contemporary Spanish poetry, particularly Cernuda and Machado&#151;to whom he devoted a reader's guide&#151;and Valente, was also exemplary, being both original and inspirational.<br>
<br>Terry's involvement with the life of Northern Ireland, crystallized by his marriage, was further cemented by his membership of the Belfast Writers' Group founded in 1963. Though his original contributions were limited to translations, his presence was indispensable, as was his organizing work, which won him praise from Philip Hobsbaum, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, and Philip Larkin among others. In this way, the same solidarity, commitment, and support which typified Terry's commitment to Catalan writers throughout the dictatorship was exhibited in his personal and professional life at the start of the &#145;troubles&#146; in Northern Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1973 the University of Essex offered Terry the chair in literature, where his contribution to Hispanic culture, translation, and comparative literature was afforded more scope to flourish. His <span class="italic">Catalan Literature</span> (1972, reissued in 2003 as a revised and updated <span class="italic">Companion to Catalan Literature</span>) became a <i>sine qua non</i> for students of this discipline. Likewise his bilingual anthology of the fifteenth-century poet Ausi&agrave;s March (<span class="italic">Selected Poems</span>, 1976) introduced the genius of this major Valencian writer to an English-speaking readership (as he was to do in the same way with Gabriel Ferrater in 2003). Even after his retirement in 1993 Terry remained a dynamic and diligent Hispanist. The lectures of his tenure as the Jos&eacute; Angel Valente professor of poetry at the University of Santiago de Compostela appeared as <span class="italic">La idea de la lengua en la poesia espa&ntilde;ola</span> in 2002.<br>
<br>Given such a distinguished academic profile it is not surprising that official recognition was forthcoming. Terry served as president of the Anglo-Catalan Society (1962&#150;5) whose conference at Cardiff University in 2002 took the form of a homage to this respected and cherished senior member. He also presided over the British Comparative Literature Association and the Associaci&oacute; Internacional de Llengua i Literatura Catalanes (1982&#150;8), which in view of his international prestige dedicated a four-volume Festschrift to him, <span class="italic">Homenatge a Arthur Terry</span> (1997&#150;2000). Terry's pre-eminence was marked in turn by a series of institutional honours: the premi internacional Catal&ograve;nia (from the Institut d'Estudis Catalans, 1970), the creu de Sant Jordi (from the autonomous Catalan government, 1982), and the premi internacional Ramon Llull (from the Fundaci&oacute; Congr&eacute;s de Cultura Catalana, 1995).<br>
<br>However, it was as much for his personal integrity as for his professional achievement that Arthur Terry was remembered. As supervisor, examiner, and mentor to a whole generation of Hispanists it is no exaggeration to consider him as the inspiration and guiding light to what became a thriving and highly successful community of Catalanists in universities in Britain and Ireland. His expertise, friendship, and support was extended generously to one and all. His devotion to Irish and Catalan culture was, likewise, no accident but a willingly embraced commitment to the democratic rights of minority nations to have their creative voice recognized at moments of repression and crisis. His down-to-earth manner, unfussy steadfastness, and long-term engagement in matters personal, academic, and ethical was summed up well by the recollection of the Hispanic scholar Nicholas Round: &#145;When I come to think of it, I have no memories of Arthur being in a hurry.&#146; Terry died on 24 January 2004 at his home, 11 Braiswick, Colchester, Essex, from acute peritonitis. His death made headline news in Barcelona. He was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
