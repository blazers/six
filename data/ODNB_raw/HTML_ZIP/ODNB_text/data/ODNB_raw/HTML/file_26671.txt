<span class="headword">Strickland, Sir  William</span>, first baronet, appointed Lord Strickland under the protectorate  (<em>c.</em>1596&#150;1673), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Boynton, near Bridlington, Yorkshire, the eldest son of the antiquary Walter Strickland (<i>d</i>. 1636) of Boynton and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1636), daughter of Peter Wentworth of Lillingstone Lovell, Oxfordshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth. His grandfathers, William Strickland and Peter Wentworth, were leading Elizabethan exponents of further reformation for the church and he has been described as &#145;a third generation Puritan&#146;  (Cliffe, <span class="italic">Puritan Gentry</span>, 12). He matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, at Easter 1614 and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 21 May 1617. On 18 June 1622 he married his first wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;1629), daughter of Sir Richard Cholmley of Whitby and his first wife, Susanna, daughter of John Legard of Ganton. The couple had four daughters but no sons; she died in 1629 and was buried at Whitby. Strickland was knighted on 24 June 1630 and married again on 3 May 1631. His second wife was Lady Frances Finch (<i>d</i>. 1663), eldest daughter of Thomas Finch, first earl of Winchilsea, and Cicely, daughter of John Wentworth of Gosfield, Essex. Strickland served as a JP in the North and East ridings and was MP for Hedon during the Long Parliament of 1640&#150;53. He signed the Yorkshire petition presented to the king on 30 July 1640 and later took the protestation. The king created him baronet, of Boynton, on 30 July 1641, but he nevertheless embraced the parliamentary cause. He was an active committeeman at Westminster and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26669/', "Walter Strickland (1598?&#150;1671)")</script> was parliament's agent in the Netherlands. On 22 February 1643 a royalist convoy containing Queen Henrietta Maria came ashore at Bridlington and plundered Boynton Hall, as reported to parliament by Sir John Hotham on 9 March: &#145;Sir William hath lost above 4,000<i>l</i>. in his goods and all his evidence seized upon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.102).<br>
<br>In 1644 Strickland served on the key parliamentary committees for demolishing superstitious monuments and for preparing the directory of public worship. Siding with the presbyterians in 1647, he remained in parliament during the speaker's absence. He was not excluded by Pride's Purge on 6 December 1648, but temporarily withdrew to avoid involvement in the regicide. Edmund Ludlow asserted that Strickland carried the news to London of Cromwell's victory at Dunbar on 3 September 1650. Strickland was MP for the East Riding in the protectorate parliaments of 1654&#150;5 and 1656. He spoke out against the &#145;horrid blasphemy&#146; of the Quaker James Nayler, but was opposed to his execution until after the sentence of imprisonment had been passed. Debating the Quaker problem on 18 December 1656, he orated: &#145;They are a growing evil and the greatest that ever was &hellip; all levellers against magistracy and propriety&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.131, 169, 220). He condemned tithe refusers, warning parliament on 24 April 1657: &#145;Nothing is so like to blast your settlement, as a land tax&#146;  (ibid., 2.24). Elevated to Cromwell's House of Lords as William, Lord Strickland, on 10 December 1657, he later served Richard Cromwell as a privy councillor. He sat in the restored Rump Parliament of 1659, but withdrew after the excluded members returned.<br>
<br>Although Strickland profited substantially from his interregnum offices and his purchase of confiscated royalist estates in the 1650s, at the Restoration he was unmolested and retired from public life. Having inherited nine manors from his father, by the 1670s he was among the ten richest East Riding landowners, holding estates at Boynton, Flamborough, and Hildenley worth up to &pound;2000 a year. He wore visibly puritan attire and remained an important patron of the godly: &#145;a public professor of religion, and one that openly owned it, and that to the uttermost of his power sheltered and protected the strictest professors thereof&#146;  (Morrice MSS, vol. 3). He died at Boynton on 12 September 1673 and was buried there on 16 September. His only son, Thomas (1638&#150;1684), succeeded him as second baronet.<br>
