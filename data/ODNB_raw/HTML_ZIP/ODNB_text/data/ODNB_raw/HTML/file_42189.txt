<span class="headword">Mott,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1788, <em>d.</em> 1851), <span class="occ">assistant poor law commissioner</span>, was baptized on 28 August 1788 at Loughton, Essex, the tenth of eleven children of John Mott, keeper of The Crown inn, Loughton, and his wife, Ann Hewes. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, London, after his father secured a nomination. He left the school on 1 October 1803 to be apprenticed, first to Gascoigne, Dawson, and Dixon, sugar brokers, and then to Baring, Mair &amp; Co., commission agents and insurance brokers. He then set up in business on his own in Limehouse. Mott married (the name of his wife has not been discovered), but the relationship was not a success and Mott later lived with Mary Cook, or Stanbury (<i>b</i>. 1800/01), with whom he had possibly twelve children. His private affairs provoked animosity, and after he had attained public prominence an anonymous letter to the poor law commissioners accused him of having previously operated a brothel, of fraudulent conduct, and of having attempted to incarcerate his wife in the asylum he then owned.<br>
<br>Mott's major success during this period was to obtain contracts to manage paupers under the old poor law, first in the parish of Newington, Surrey, and then, after ten years, in the neighbouring parish of Lambeth. He became joint proprietor of the Peckham House Asylum, a private lunatic asylum for 300 mixed private and pauper patients, into which he directed the paupers from the parishes he was managing; he also invested funds in a brewery. These investments were funded by large sums borrowed from family members and acquaintances. Mott claimed that before the introduction of the new poor law system the turnover from his activities amounted to &pound;50,000 per annum; this enabled him to buy a freehold house in Forest Hill, and to keep a carriage and suitable establishment.<br>
<br>The coming of the new poor law ended Mott's contractual earnings but on 4 November 1834 he was appointed an assistant poor law commissioner, for which he received a salary of &pound;700, plus expenses; he was, however, expected to relinquish his commercial interests. Much of his work with the poor law commission was in the north of England; here he proved a more emollient personality than Alfred Power, who had antagonized the poor law unions in industrial Lancashire and Yorkshire, but he was nevertheless involved in two major controversies. His report on the Bolton union was the target of an attack by John Bowring, Bolton's MP. Further controversy followed when a report which had been covertly compiled by Mott on the activities of the Keighley union was used by the home secretary, Sir James Graham, to attack William Ferrand, MP for Knaresborough and a former chairman of the Keighley Guardians. Although Ferrand subsequently claimed vindication after a parliamentary inquiry he retained an animus against Mott for some considerable time afterwards. Mott ceased to be an assistant commissioner, at the end of 1842, when their numbers were reduced.<br>
<br>The loss of this post, together with financial problems besetting him from the failure of his brewery investment, the demands of his creditors for repayment of their loans, and his high living expenses meant that Mott was now financially hard pressed. First he took on the editorship of the <span class="italic">Poor Law Guide</span>, which appeared for the first time in March 1843 but folded nine months later; then he persuaded his friend George Coode, one of the assistant secretaries to the poor law commission, to invest in another private lunatic asylum at Haydock Lodge, near Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire, again accepting both private patients and pauper lunatics, who came from Lancashire, north Wales, and other areas. Mott was to be superintendent on a salary of &pound;200, plus a share of the profits; to conceal the involvement of a civil servant with a private speculation the nominal proprietor was Coode's sister Louisa, a resident of Jersey.<br>
<br>As neither Coode nor his sister could readily visit to supervise the venture Mott was given a free rein at Haydock Lodge, which opened for business in February 1844. He entertained lavishly in order to persuade overseers and guardians to send their lunatics to the asylum, and appointed several members of his family to positions within the establishment. Mott himself was frequently absent, having used his influence to secure an elected position as auditor to the local poor law unions for a further &pound;379 per annum.<br>
<br>Haydock Lodge quickly became the focus of a scandal, owing to the persistence of Dr Owen Owen Roberts, a radical Welsh anti-poor law campaigner, who petitioned parliament about the treatment that one of his patients received there. The commissioners in lunacy were forced, with some reluctance, to inquire into the operation of the asylum. In the ensuing furore Coode was required to resign his position with the poor law commission, whereupon he moved to Haydock to find that Mott had expropriated several thousand pounds of fees from the asylum. Dismissed by Coode in May 1846, and pursued through the courts by creditors, Mott fled to the Isle of Man in early October of the same year. He later returned to the mainland to depose evidence for the poor law commissioner, George Cornewall Lewis, in an action against Ferrand arising from the Keighley case, and to continue his work as auditor. It was while on his travels on these duties that Mott was seized by the sheriff's officer and brought before the insolvent debtors court at Lancaster. Released after making an arrangement with his creditors, Mott evidently retained a belief in his own worth as he was soon lobbying Edwin Chadwick to consider him for appointment as an assistant commissioner for the health of towns commission. The appointment, however, did not materialize and Mott ended his working life almost as he began it, working as a commission agent in Manchester. He died of apoplexy on 11 May 1851, at Moor Grove, Rusholme, Manchester.<br>
