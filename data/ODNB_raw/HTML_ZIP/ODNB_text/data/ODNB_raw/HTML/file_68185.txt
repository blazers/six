<span class="headword">Stephenson,  Sarah</span>  (1738&#150;1802), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and autobiographer</span>, was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, the elder daughter and first of three children of Daniel Stephenson and Sarah Storrs. The only source of information about her life, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Travels in the Service of the Gospel of Sarah Stephenson</span> (1807), was assembled from &#145;detached pieces&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, vi) by a male editor who, aware of &#145;the want of exactness in arrangement&#146;, cautions the reader not to expect a &#145;connected narration&#146;  (ibid., 25). Her father was a prosperous merchant and the family lived a genteel existence until financial losses forced them to separate. For seven years Stephenson lived with a maternal aunt, Hannah Corbyn, in Worcester; she recalled how the Quaker Elizabeth Ashbridge had visited and disapproved of a ribbon in her hair. At her father's request she was reunited with her sister and brother in Douglas, on the Isle of Man; she was disappointed to find two female Quaker visitors to the island &#145;playing at cards&#146;  (ibid., 9). Her father died while she was in Liverpool, where she had &#145;a prospect of the awful service of ministry&#146;  (ibid., 13).<br>
<br>After her cousin Katherine Fry's marriage to Edward Jeffreys, Stephenson accompanied the couple to their new home at or near Melksham, in Wiltshire. In 1767, at the age of twenty-nine, she first served as a public minister at Worcester. The bulk of <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> is taken up with the itinerary of her visits and ministries, first in her native county of Cumberland, then in Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. Despite periods of sickness and dejection she was &#145;an indefatigable laborer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 171) and visited Ireland and Scotland twice. In 1801 she answered the call to travel with her cousin Mary Jeffreys to North America, recording her surprise &#145;that such a poor creature should be called to service of such magnitude&#146;  (ibid., 173). The sixty-three-year-old Stephenson recounted the hot weather and the inconvenience of mosquitoes in Long Island. Having attended Quaker meetings in Flushing, Westbury, Newtown, Plainfield, Stoneybrook, and Trenton, and noting that &#145;she was but <i>where</i> and <i>what</i> she ought to be&#146;  (ibid., 201), she died in Philadelphia on 26 April 1802.<br>
