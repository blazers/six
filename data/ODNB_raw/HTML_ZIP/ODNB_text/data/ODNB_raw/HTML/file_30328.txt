<span class="headword">Acton, Sir  Edward</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Stretford in Lancashire on 6 November 1865, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49449/', "Henry Morell Acton (1828&#150;1907)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74/', "Acton, Henry")</script>], one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and his wife, Anne Shaw, daughter of Nathaniel Williamson, sharebroker, of Manchester. He was educated at Uppingham School, where he was an exhibitioner, and Wadham College, Oxford, where he held a classical scholarship and the Hody Greek exhibition. He was at Oxford from 1884 to 1888 and thus was a precursor rather than a member of that remarkable group of Wadham lawyers which included Frederick Edwin Smith (the future earl of Birkenhead), Alexander Adair Roche (later Lord Roche), and John Allsebrook Simon (later Viscount Simon). After gaining a first in classical moderations (1886) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1888), Acton joined the Inner Temple, where he was awarded a foundation scholarship in 1890; he was called to the bar in 1891 and later became a bencher of his inn.<br>
<br>Acton joined the northern circuit and practised in Manchester and Liverpool, where he soon built up an extensive practice. On 12 August 1903 he married Edith Nina, daughter of Conrad William Alexander Tulloch, a chartered accountant, of London. Acton and his wife were devoted to each other; there were no children of the marriage. In 1913 Acton became a lecturer in the law of evidence and procedure at the University of Manchester. In 1918, when he might have been expected to be thinking of taking silk, he surprised those who knew him by accepting appointment as a county court judge. For the next two years he worked on circuit 18 at Nottingham.<br>
<br>In 1920 arrears of work in the King's Bench Division made it necessary to appoint two additional judges and Acton was chosen to fill one of these posts by Birkenhead, the lord chancellor, himself an old member of the northern circuit. Such a promotion from the county court to the High Court had never been made before. The experiment was successful, however, and the precedent created in Acton's case has since been followed on a number of occasions. Acton received the customary knighthood on his appointment to the bench in 1920. In 1934 ill health compelled him to retire and he lived quietly, a semi-invalid, at his home, The Hatch, Churt, Surrey, where he died on 17 November 1945. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>At the bar Acton had a large and solid practice; as an advocate he was sound and accurate but not spectacular. These qualities he displayed on the bench. In his judgments he was content to deal closely with the case in hand without feeling it necessary to elaborate on the surrounding legal field or to strive after the distinction of creating precedents for quotation in the books. Although he was so modest, his decisions satisfactorily stood the test of appeal.<br>
<br>Acton was interested in the theatre and music, though as an auditor rather than a performer. A portrait by John St Helier Lander is in Wadham College, of which he was elected an honorary fellow in 1923. The artist's attempt to overcome the belittling effect on the face which the wearing of a full-bottomed wig can have has not been entirely successful, and the picture gives the impression that Acton was of larger proportions than was the fact.<br>
