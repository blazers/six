<span class="headword">Knight,  Robert</span>  (1833&#150;1911), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 5 September 1833 in Lifton, Devon, the son of a blacksmith. He attended the village school until the age of twelve when he began his training in metalworking with his father. Following the customary tramp around the country to extend his skills, he settled in 1857 as an angle-iron smith at the Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth where he stayed for the next fourteen years, becoming increasingly involved in the local affairs of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders. Presented by his supporters as a vigorous leader of demarcation disputes against the shipwrights, he was elected as the union's general secretary in 1871, a post he held, first in Liverpool and then in Newcastle, until his retirement in 1899. Robert Knight was of average height with thick dark hair and a full beard; socially he could be charming, but his most notable capacities were for hard work, thorough preparation, and logical argument. He was married twice, his first wife having died in 1879, and had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>At first Knight's responsibilities as general secretary were fairly straightforward as, although the Boilermakers' Society like many of the earlier craft unions was in need of improved administration, this was a period of low unemployment and growing union influence. He was therefore able to make an immediate impression on the boilermakers' organizational structure and benefit provisions, as well as to inaugurate unusually thorough and accurate annual reports on membership, finances, and branch activities in a format retained substantially intact by the union until the 1960s. Once again his reputation as an outstanding organizer spread beyond the area of his immediate responsibilities and in 1875 he was elected chairman of the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). As this coincided with the peak of the union campaign against the restrictive elements of the trade union legislation of 1871, Knight worked closely with George Howell and subsequently appeared on the platform at the victory celebrations, giving a speech which was notable for its ambitious vision of the role of trade unionists in pressing for further social reforms in the areas of education and housing. However, the fifteen years after 1875 were to be bleak ones for the unions, with persistently high unemployment eroding financial reserves and involvement in ill-timed industrial disputes leading to the collapse of many organizations. In this context Knight began to pursue an increasingly cautious and moderate policy, largely withdrawing from national labour affairs to focus on his own union's survival, and placing the long-term health of its finances above the temptation of short-term local wage increases. This led to friction with some of the branches, particularly in the shipbuilding districts where the bulk of the union's membership was now concentrated. As a result, the union's head office was moved from Liverpool to a special new building in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1890, allowing Knight not only to maintain closer links with his members in the shipyards but also to play a prominent role in the affairs of this highly democratic community: particularly in St James's Congregational Church, in the local Liberal Party, and as a magistrate.<br>
<br>This combination of industrial caution and political Liberalism led the new generation of more militant, frequently socialist-influenced, union leaders who began to emerge after 1889 to see Knight as one of the leading figures of an outdated and unimaginative style of trade unionism. However, even in the 1880s he had been a keen advocate of the incorporation of neighbouring semi-skilled groups to secure the boilermakers' bargaining position, and he adapted rapidly to the improved economic conditions of the 1890s. He initiated co-operation between unions to reduce wasteful demarcation disputes, leading to the establishment of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades in 1890; he pressed the employers to set up fully recognized local wage-bargaining procedures, beginning on the north-east coast in 1894; and he pioneered trade union initiative over industry-wide agreements, most notably on the number of apprentices in 1893. This ambitious programme of co-ordinated labour action to regulate industrial conditions led the Fabian socialists Sidney and Beatrice Webb to praise Knight's progressive role in their <span class="italic">History of Trade Unionism</span> (1894).<br>
<br>Politically, however, Knight remained a confirmed radical Liberal and once again began to take a more active role within the TUC, this time as one of the most articulate opponents of the new generation of socialists: he preferred local collective bargaining to the statutory imposition of the eight-hour day, and he preferred constitutional reform to the public ownership of industry. Moreover, when the Conservative victory in the 1895 general election was widely blamed on the disruptive behaviour of the Independent Labour Party, Knight became one of the leading supporters of the rule changes which excluded the most prominent socialist activists from the TUC. This pushed the Webbs into changing their line, and in the opening section of <span class="italic">Industrial Democracy</span> (1897) they painted an influential portrait of Knight as an autocrat whose power in the wider labour movement was based on the decay of democracy within his own organization. However, this relied on a distorted account of the internal arrangements of the Boilermakers' Society, as was immediately demonstrated by its members' approval of a major reform of its constitution in the face of forceful opposition from Knight. For its part, the Independent Labour Party began to move towards greater co-operation with the older generation of radical-Liberal trade unionists and, as one of this group's senior statesmen, Knight had a major role to play in the response. As a long-standing advocate of union federation he worked closely with &#145;new unionists&#146; to establish the General Federation of Trade Unions in 1899, and as a long-standing advocate of greater union representation in parliament he worked along with other &#145;old unionists&#146; such as W. J. Davis and Alexander Wilkie to build a co-operative relationship with Keir Hardie around the conference which founded the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95367', "Labour Representation Committee")</script> in 1900.<br>
<br>Following his retirement, Knight remained active in local affairs; he died from pneumonia on 17 September 1911 at 19 Highbury, his home in Newcastle, and was buried in St Andrew's cemetery, Newcastle. He was survived by his second wife and two sons and a daughter.<br>
