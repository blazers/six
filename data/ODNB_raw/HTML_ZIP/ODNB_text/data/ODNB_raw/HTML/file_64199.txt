<span class="headword">Bedford,  Francis</span>  (1815&#150;1894), <span class="occ">lithographer and photographer</span>, was born on 13 August 1815, probably at 8 Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, London, and baptized at St George, Bloomsbury, on 31 January 1816, the son of Francis Octavius Bedford (1784&#150;1858) and his wife, Sophie Curtis. His father studied under Sir John Soane to become a well-respected architect responsible for a number of London churches. Nothing is known of Bedford's early education, but the implication that he trained formally as an artist and draughtsman is confirmed by his regular submission of architectural studies to the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy between 1833 and 1849.<br>
<br>During this same period Bedford illustrated several publications concerned with the ecclesiastical architecture of London and York. It is thought that these brought him to the attention of the celebrated publishers and lithographers Day &amp; Sons, whose innovative and costly production techniques placed them at the forefront of printing technology. Bedford's role at Day &amp; Sons was to transfer the drawings and designs of artists intended as illustrations directly on to the lithographic stone in preparation for printing, a procedure that was both exacting and highly regarded. In this role he was responsible for the complex lithographs in colour and gold for both Digby Wyatt's <span class="italic">Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century</span> of 1851 and J. B. Waring's <span class="italic">The Art Treasures of the United Kingdom</span> of 1857. Working with a team of four assistants Bedford completed the hundred plates for Owen Jones's <span class="italic">Grammar of Ornament</span> (1856) in less than a year, and was credited by Jones for having taken personal responsibility for their perfection.<br>
<br>Given his training as an artist and his meticulous attention to detail, it is not surprising that Bedford turned to photography about 1853, just at the time when the medium was emerging more fully into the public domain following the introduction of the collodion process. This process offered a delicacy and tonal balance that must have appealed to Bedford's acutely sensitive eye, for throughout his long career as a photographer it remained his preferred medium. He first came to public notice in 1854 when Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought examples of his work from the first annual exhibition of the Photographic Society, of which they had recently become patrons. Later in the year they commissioned him to photograph the works of art from the Royal Collection on public exhibition at Marlborough House. As a further mark of her regard the queen commissioned Bedford to travel to Germany incognito in order to photograph scenes associated with her husband's childhood in Coburg. The album she gave the prince as a surprise birthday present in August 1857 was warmly received and as a consequence Bedford was sent to photograph the adjoining principality of Gotha in 1858. When the prince of Wales undertook an educational voyage of the Mediterranean, Egypt, the Holy Land, and Syria in spring 1862, Bedford was chosen to accompany the royal party and document the tour. Despite the many discomforts of heat, dust, and insects Bedford made over 200 negatives. A comprehensive selection was shown in London at the German Gallery, Bond Street, and published as a series of portfolios by Day &amp; Sons, the most expensive of which cost 43 guineas, a price placing it well beyond the reach of all but the most wealthy. Doubtless royal patronage helped to establish Bedford's status among the growing band of artist&#150;photographers who were starting to define the professional future of the medium during this period. Bedford became an active member of the Photographic Society shortly after its formation in 1853; he was elected to its council in 1858 and twice became vice-president, first in 1861 and then again in 1878.<br>
<br>Even before his trip to the Middle East, Bedford was well established as a leading photographer and publisher of topographic and architectural views for the burgeoning middle-class market. Francis Frith, George Washington Wilson, and James Valentine dominated this market in England and Scotland respectively, leaving Bedford to range freely in Wales, which he effectively colonized as his own photographic territory. Initially he specialized in publishing stereoscopic views when they were the height of fashion. In the latter half of the 1860s he published a series of portfolios of <span class="italic">Photographic Views</span> of Wales, Devon, and Warwickshire and consolidated the repertoire of his catalogue by travelling widely in his specially built carriage which functioned both as darkroom and living quarters. His surviving prints are characterized by their rich tonalities and deep purple-brown colour. Throughout his career as a photographer Bedford exhibited widely both in Britain and abroad, winning numerous medals and awards for the excellence of his landscapes and topographic studies. Examples of his work are preserved at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford; in the Royal Archives at Windsor; and at George Eastman House, Rochester, New York, among other repositories.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1840 Bedford married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1807/8), daughter of William Graham, upholsterer. According to the 1881 census their only son William, born in 1846, was living at the same address with his own wife and son. By this date William was shouldering the day-to-day responsibilities of his father's business, and he went on to become an eminent photographer in his own right. Francis Bedford died at his home at 326 Camden Road, Islington, on 15 May 1894, and was buried on 26 May in Highgate cemetery.<br>
