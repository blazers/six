<span class="headword">Stapleton,  Gregory</span>  (1748&#150;1802), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the midland district</span>, born on 7 December 1748 at Carlton Hall, Yorkshire, was the seventh son of Nicholas Stapleton and his third wife, Winifred, daughter of John White of Dover Street, London. After preparatory studies at Esquerchin he proceeded to the English College, Douai, in 1762. On his ordination he became procurator of the college, and left that post twelve years later because of difficulties with its new president, William Gibson. After this he travelled abroad with a pupil; and on his return from Italy, in 1787, he was appointed president of the English College at St Omer, in succession to Alban Butler.<br>
<br>The revolution of 1789 soon adversely affected British institutions in France. Imprisoned in the French College at St Omer in August 1793 the president, several professors, and fifty-two students were removed to Arras in January 1794, where they were threatened with death, before joining the &#145;trente-deux&#146; from the Douai college incarcerated at Doullens. When restrictions were lifted, Stapleton travelled to Paris to secure an order from the Directory for the release of the prisoners, and on 2 March 1795 they all arrived back at Dover on board an American ship. Soon afterwards Stapleton, accompanied by Bishop Douglass, sought an interview with the duke of Portland and William Pitt to seek their approval of a plan for converting the school at Old Hall Green, near Ware, Hertfordshire, into a Catholic college. The duke had previously known Stapleton, and he and Pitt gave them encouragement. Stapleton accordingly conducted his students to Old Hall Green, and on 19 August 1795 the first stone was laid of the College of St Edmund.<br>
<br>Stapleton presided over the college until the autumn of 1800, when, having accompanied the Revd John Nassau to Rome on an important secret mission, he was raised to the episcopate. His appointment as bishop of Hierocaesarea <i>in partibus</i> and vicar apostolic of the midland district, in succession to Charles Berington, was approved by the pope on 29 May 1800, and he was consecrated on 8 March 1801. He took up his residence at Long Birch, near Wolverhampton, and employed John Milner as his secretary. Stapleton died at St Omer on 23 May 1802, on his way with other representatives to reclaim British property after the peace of Amiens, and was succeeded in his vicariate by Milner. The midland district especially felt the loss of his quiet and peaceful temperament. He was buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Omer.<br>
