<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Charles</span>  (1597&#150;1673), <span class="occ">antiquary and genealogist</span>, was born at Denton Hall in the parish of Otley in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 5 March 1597, the seventh and third surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9091/', "Thomas Fairfax, first Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1560&#150;1640)")</script>, and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Robert Aske of Aughton, esquire, and his wife, Elizabeth. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 5 October 1611, and on the 27th of the same month was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, from where he was called to the bar on 9 March 1618. His father allegedly commented, &#145;I sent him to the Inns of Court, and he is a good divine, but nobody at the law&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of the Great Lord Fairfax</span>, 149n.). About 1627 he married Mary Breary (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter and sole heir of John Brearey of Scow Hall and Menston. They had fourteen children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9085/', "Henry Fairfax")</script>, later dean of Norwich, establishing their residence at Menston Hall, also in the parish of Otley. He became a governor of Otley grammar school in January 1642.<br>
<br>Fairfax was taken prisoner by the royalists during the civil war, but his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9081/', "Ferdinando Fairfax, second Lord Fairfax")</script> and parliament's general of the northern counties, negotiated his exchange at Street Houses, near York. Shortly before the battle of Marston Moor, Oliver Cromwell stayed with him at Menston. After the siege of York, he searched through the rubble of St Mary's Tower with his fellow antiquary, Roger Dodsworth, recovering several ancient relics and documents. Appointed a JP in 1645, he led the initiatives of his fellow magistrates to relieve the poor suffering from plague, and was among the most active West Riding JPs of the interregnum. In 1646 Ferdinando appointed him to intervene in a dispute between Lady Pembroke and Lady Cork over the Clifford estates, in which he spent seven weeks examining evidences at Skipton Castle. He wrote to his brother explaining, &#145;I am the ill instrument of their unhappy differences betwixt the ladies&#146;  (Bell, 1.303). Ferdinando later secured for him the stewardships of the courts at Cawood, Otley, and Ripon.<br>
<br>Fairfax celebrated the victories of the New Model Army, commanded by his nephew Sir Thomas Fairfax, reflecting: &#145;The giving all unto God (of which he has an honourable testimony) is the most thriving way&#146;  (Bell, 1.243). He was commissioned as a colonel himself in time for the second civil war, and his regiment fought at the battle of Preston. In 1649 he supported the creation of a radical chapel at Bramhope, in Otley parish, and was among the five trustees who appointed the minister. Between 1652 and 1660 he wrote the &#145;Analecta Fairfaxiana&#146;, containing detailed pedigrees of all branches of the Fairfax family, with about fifty anagrams, epigrams, and elegies in Latin concerning different members of the family. The work was never printed and only two manuscript copies are thought to exist, one of which is held by the Brotherton Library at Leeds. Along with Roger Dodsworth, he was responsible for the collection and preservation of the valuable Dodsworth MSS volumes, which went to the Bodleian Library at Oxford.<br>
<br>During the 1650s Fairfax's regiment served in Scotland under General George Monck; its colours were deep blue and bore the motto &#145;Fideliter faeliciter&#146;  (C. H. Firth, <span class="italic">Cromwell's Army</span>, 4th edn, 1962, 46). His regiment had been &#145;a hotbed of sectarian enthusiasm&#146;  (Woolrych, &#145;Yorkshire and the Restoration&#146;, 499n.), but he was personally trusted by Monck and he accompanied him into England in January 1660. His regiment was left behind to garrison York and he also became the military governor of Hull on 12 March. Shortly afterwards he resigned this post to Lord Belasyse, and was granted a pension of &pound;100 a year for himself and his heirs by Charles II out of the customs at Hull. After a long retirement, he died at Menston in 1673. His will, which bequeathed to Lincoln's Inn &#145;Twoe of my Choysest Manuscripts of Law, one beinge the Analls of kinge Edw[ard] the 2<sup>nd</sup>&#146;  (will), directed that he should be buried &#145;without needles Ceremony&#146;. He was interred beside his wife in the Fairfax transept in Otley parish church on 22 December 1673.<br>
