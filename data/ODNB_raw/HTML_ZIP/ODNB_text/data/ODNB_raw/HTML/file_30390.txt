</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Allen,  (Reginald) Clifford</span>, Baron Allen of Hurtwood  (1889&#150;1939), <span class="occ">politician and peace campaigner</span>, was born at St Olave's, Slow Park, Newport, Monmouthshire, on 9 May 1889. As an adult he was always known as Clifford Allen, or by close friends as CA. He had a brother, Walter Godfrey Allen (1891&#150;1986), who became an architect, and two sisters. His father, Walter Allen (1855&#150;1913), owned a drapery business; his mother, Frances Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker, died in 1903 aged thirty-five and left her son two legacies&#151;precarious health and moral seriousness. Allen was educated at Berkhamsted School, at University College, Bristol, and from 1908 to 1911 at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He intended to take holy orders but at Cambridge his Anglicanism gave way to secularism and his political Conservatism to socialism, which found expression in the university Fabian Society. After leaving Cambridge, Allen remained an active Fabian and joined the City of London branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was heavily involved in the emergence of a Labour newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Citizen</span>, demonstrating a flair for organizational work and making many significant contacts within the labour movement, not least with Ramsay MacDonald. The newspaper first appeared on 8 October 1912 but, after the outbreak of war, its persistent financial difficulties led to its demise in May 1915.<br>
<br>The war transformed Allen's political reputation. His position was uncompromisingly anti-war. He published a speech under the title <span class="italic">Is Germany Right and Britain Wrong?</span> Most significantly, he was involved centrally in the formation of the No-Conscription Fellowship (NCF) late in 1914 and identified thoroughly with the ILP's defence of internationalism and its criticism of militarism. With the introduction of military conscription in 1916, the NCF dedicated itself to support for individual resisters. Allen would have been exempted from military service on health grounds, but chose to contest his conscription with the claim that his position as NCF chairman qualified as essential war work. But in August 1916 he was arrested, court-martialled, and gaoled. He chose the absolutist position, and refused to accept the option of non-combatant work. Released twice and rearrested, he was finally sentenced to two years' hard labour. His health deteriorated radically and he was released in December 1917, following an agitation on behalf of the imprisoned absolutists.<br>
<br>Allen left prison with severely damaged lungs. The remainder of his life alternated between periods of intense political activity and bouts of illness followed by convalescence. Within the ILP Allen's war record gave him a heroic status. His experiences symbolized the principled commitment and suffering of many party members. In 1920 he visited the Soviet Union as a member of a joint Labour Party&#150;Trades Union Congress delegation. He was attracted by the egalitarianism of the Soviet experiment but was also concerned about the threat of bureaucratization.<br>
<br>Allen thought that in British conditions the transition to socialism could be made without violence. In the early 1920s he saw the ILP as a viable instrument, and he promoted the idea of the ILP as a socialist think-tank developing detailed policies for the wider labour movement. Such an ambition necessitated funds. Allen was elected ILP treasurer in 1922 and demonstrated a talent for raising money from a wide range of progressive sympathizers. Party organization was made more professional; the party newspaper, <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, became the <span class="italic">New Leader</span>. Edited by H. N. Brailsford, this became renowned for socialist journalism of a very high quality. The unexpected advent of a Labour government in January 1924 with prominent ILP members in key posts, including MacDonald as prime minister, suggested that Allen's strategy might be effective.<br>
<br>Allen became ILP chairman in 1923, and at the party conferences of 1924 and 1925 he emphasized the need to develop detailed policies based on thoroughly scientific investigation combined with a strongly moral commitment. The most famous product of this agenda was the doctrine of the <span class="italic">Living Wage</span>, published by the ILP in 1926. This powerful, if ambiguous, policy represented a serious attempt to provide a response to poverty and unemployment, an alternative to the dominant economic orthodoxy. But Allen had already ceased to count within the ILP, and resigned as chairman, ostensibly on the ground of ill health, in October 1925. In reality, his resignation stemmed from personal and political differences. Experience of Labour in office had deepened the antagonism of many on the left of the ILP towards MacDonald. For such critics, Allen's approach seemed too conciliatory and too remote from working-class experience. Allen, however, felt that a more adversarial policy would damage the prospects for socialism. He became exasperated with some ILP members who indulged in socialist rhetoric but avoided serious thinking. His resignation marked a significant moment in the leftward shift of the ILP.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Allen continued his involvement in the labour movement, not least as a director of the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> from 1925 to 1930. These links were effectively destroyed in the crisis of 1931. Although ill, Allen supported MacDonald in deciding to lead a national government and then in the subsequent election campaign. In letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> he emphasized the need to restore confidence, and criticized the Labour Party for refusing to join a national government. The argument failed to appreciate the sense of solidarity that had kept almost all Labour politicians and many Labour sympathizers united through the crisis. His rarely reciprocated admiration for MacDonald was a powerful factor. Allen's apostasy was confirmed for many former associates when he accepted a peerage as Baron Allen of Hurtwood in the new year's honours list of 1932. His subsequent attempt to develop a significant political presence for the small <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95547', "National Labour")</script> group was disillusioning. MacDonald was largely inaccessible, and Allen's view that National Labour could be the socialist leaven in the National Government ignored its numerical weakness in the Commons. Eventually Allen shifted his focus to developing a broad cross-party progressive programme centred on the idea of planning. In February 1935 he played a central role in setting up the Next Five Years group. His most significant collaborators were a dissident Conservative member, Harold Macmillan, and the economist Sir Arthur Salter. The result was the publication in July 1935 of <span class="italic">The Next Five Years</span>. Subtitled <span class="italic">An Essay in Political Agreement</span>, it was supported by 153 political and literary figures. The legacy of 1931 remained potent and the labour movement was almost unrepresented. Allen, in turn, remained hostile to the Labour Party and was suspicious of any collaboration with Lloyd George's Council of Action for Peace and Reconstruction. He still saw the National Government as the only plausible administration. The Next Five Years group offered an agenda without an instrument, a manifestation of the unsuccessful quest for a British new deal.<br>
<br>Predictably, Allen opposed the Versailles settlement and argued consistently that German grievances should be responded to sympathetically. Late in 1934 he joined the Anglo-German group with the purpose of improving relations between the two countries. He visited Hitler in January 1935 and the following year attended the Nuremburg rally. His search for a peaceful European settlement did not entail blindness to the brutality of the Nazi regime. He campaigned on behalf of political prisoners; his last speech to the Lords, on 27 July 1938, included an indictment of Nazi antisemitism. As the agitation by Czechoslovakia's Sudeten Germans threatened serious international consequences, Allen claimed that they should be allowed to join Germany. He travelled to Berlin and Prague in August 1938 to meet Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, and the Czech president, Bene&#353;, and prime minister, Hodza. The prospect emerged of a four-power conference to settle the issue, and Allen reported this to the British foreign secretary, Lord Halifax. Subsequently Allen was a thorough defender of the Munich agreement. It was his last political intervention. Exhausted and ill, he died in a sanatorium at Montana, Switzerland, on 3 March 1939. His body was cremated at Lausanne three days later and the ashes scattered on Lake Geneva.<br>
<br>Allen was survived by his wife, Marjory Gill (1897&#150;1976) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61348/', "Allen, Marjory")</script>], and by their daughter, Polly. They had married on 17 December 1921; she was the sister of Colin Gill, and cousin of Eric Gill, and was a landscape architect. They shared a commitment to experimental education and founded a nursery school in their local village. Allen felt that his wife's support had prolonged his life.<br>
<br>Allen was a complex figure. His appearance was striking: the handsome head, the auburn hair, the frailty. The impact was deepened by his reasoned yet passionate advocacy. Yet this man of austere principle and firm purpose was an effective organizer and, for some, an assured practitioner of the politician's machiavellian arts. He had a genius for friendship, but broke with political organizations and erstwhile colleagues rather than compromise his principles. One characterization presents him as a Labour renegade whose choice in 1931 condemned him to political marginality. An alternative presentation&#151;more sympathetic and perhaps more apposite&#151;identifies him as one committed to liberal, rational, humane values who believed in the feasibility of a better society but who found no effective organization for furtherance of this agenda.<br>
