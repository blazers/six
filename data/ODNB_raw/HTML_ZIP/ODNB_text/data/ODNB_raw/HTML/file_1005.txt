<span class="headword">Bacon,  Philip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of Nicholas Bacon of Shrubland Hall, Suffolk, and his wife, Martha, only child of Sir Richard Bingham of Bingham Melcombe, Dorset. Philip (who has sometimes wrongly been called Philemon) joined Charles II during his exile in Flanders, and by the favour of Sir Charles Berkeley obtained a place in the duke of York's troop. He was wounded at the battle of Mardyck (14 June 1658), one potentially lethal bullet being stopped by his hatband, whence it was plucked by the duke himself; soon afterwards Bacon was made a cornet of horse. After the Restoration he went as a reformado (volunteer officer) on Sir John Lawson's first expedition to Algiers, and was then (1661) made lieutenant of the <i>Assistance</i>. He served as lieutenant of the <i>Bonaventure</i> (1662) and the <i>St Andrew</i> (1663) in successive Mediterranean voyages, and returned in 1664 as lieutenant of Sir Thomas Allin's flagship <i>Plymouth</i>. While the fleet was at Algiers in November, Bacon replaced Nicholas Parker (left behind as consul) as captain of the <i>Nonsuch</i>. This ship was accidentally lost off Gibraltar on 2 December, and by the 29th, when Allin attacked the Dutch East India fleet, Bacon was back aboard the <i>Plymouth</i> as a supernumerary. A shot from the <i>King Solomon</i> struck him as he sat charging his gun, but again he was saved by his hat: &#145;had he stood up, he had gone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals of Sir Thomas Allin</span>, 1.192).<br>
<br>Bacon returned to England in March 1665, and by the 19th he was captain of the <i>Oxford</i>, which he would command at the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June. For his service there he was promoted to captain the 52-gun <i>Bristol</i>, in which he sailed once more for the Mediterranean in December. In his absence he was (16 March 1666) designated to command the <i>Assurance</i> in the summer's campaign, but on his return in May he remained with the <i>Bristol</i>. He was with Albemarle's part of the divided fleet, and on 28 May was instructed to cruise off the North Foreland in search of the enemy. It was his ship that, at 6 a.m. on 1 June, signalled the presence of the Dutch and the beginning of the Four Days' Fight. At 3 p.m. on the first afternoon Bacon received a fatal bullet wound to the thigh. His body was brought back to Harwich and thence to Coddenham church, Suffolk, for burial in the family vault. A marble monument records his achievements and the affection in which he was held.<br>
