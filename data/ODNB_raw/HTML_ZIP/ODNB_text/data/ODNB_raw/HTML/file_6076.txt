</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coningsby,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Coningsby  (1657&#150;1729), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 November 1657, the only son of Humphrey Coningsby (<i>d</i>. 1671), of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, and his wife, Letitia, daughter of Sir Arthur Loftus of Rathfarnham Castle, co. Dublin. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1671; his call to the Irish bar on 5 May 1691 suggests that he was called to the English bar previously, but there is no record of the event. In 1675 (licence, 18 February 1675) he married Barbara (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;1697), daughter of Ferdinando Gorges of Eye Manor, Herefordshire, and Barbados, &#145;a notorious slaver&#146;  (Ferris). The marriage was arranged without the consent of his mother, and while it did not end in divorce as often asserted, it was a tempestuous union, although this did not prevent the couple from having three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In October 1679 Coningsby entered the House of Commons as member for Leominster, Herefordshire, which he represented continuously until the election of 1710. Although his family had been royalists during the civil war Coningsby's father-in-law was a cousin of Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, and Coningsby became a supporter of Shaftesbury and of the exclusion of James, duke of York, from the succession to the throne. He was returned again in the 1681 parliament where he was named to ten committees including one charged with preparing an address on exclusion. His political alliance with his neighbour John Scudamore, second Viscount Scudamore, was threatened when Scudamore learned of an affair between Coningsby and Frances (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cecil), Lady Scudamore (<i>d</i>. 1694). The couple eloped, but were confronted by Scudamore's men who forced Lady Scudamore's return to her husband at pistol point. Coningsby sat for Leominster again in 1685, despite being advised not to do so without the support of Henry Somerset, first duke of Beaufort, a leading tory. During the 1685 parliament he was believed to have taken part in the debate on the army that followed the suppression of Monmouth's rising, but the speech against standing armies credited to him by Anchitell Grey may have been made by another member, Thomas Christie. He was an active member of the convention in 1689; in March, during the debate on the coronation oath, he proposed that William III and Mary II should swear to uphold &#145;the Doctrine of the Protestant Religion established by Law&#146;  (Grey, 9.193), which wording was adopted by parliament. Later in 1689 he spoke in the debate which held John Shales, supply officer, responsible for the failure of the duke of Schomberg's Irish campaign on the grounds that he had mismanaged the transport of troops and equipment.<h2>
<a name="Ireland"></a>Ireland</h2>Coningsby's wholehearted support of William's administration helped recommend him for office; his kinship to Henry Sidney, Viscount Sydney, one of William's closest advisers, was no doubt also important. In June 1690 Coningsby was appointed joint paymaster-general of the army which William was about to take to Ireland. His colleague was Charles Fox, son of Sir Stephen Fox; Fox managed business in London while Coningsby looked after requirements in the field. He accompanied the army to Ireland, and was by the king's side on 30 June 1690, the eve of the battle of the Boyne, when Jacobite gunners wounded William in the shoulder. Coningsby staunched the wound with his handkerchief, and so won William's personal gratitude. Following William's failure to take Limerick, and before the king returned to England from Waterford, on 2 September 1690 Coningsby was appointed a lord justice of Ireland, in charge of the civil government of Ireland, including the management of the militia, pending the appointment of a lord lieutenant or a lord deputy. The appointment was controversial as according to Gilbert Burnet Coningsby already had a reputation as &#145;a vicious man&#146; whose &#145;parts were very indifferent&#146;  (Simms, <span class="italic">Jacobite Ireland</span>, 189). Immediately afterwards Coningsby and his fellow lord justice, Viscount Sydney, left Waterford for the army headquarters at Cullen, near Tipperary, where they discussed future plans with the army's commander, Count Hendrik Trajectinus van Solms-Braunfels, and his successor, Godard van Reede-Ginckel. They then travelled north to Dublin where, on 15 September 1690, they were sworn in as lords justices. On 27 September they wrote to Hans Willem Bentinck, earl of Portland, in London, to advise him on the management of the Commons, suggesting that he rely on a broad coalition of non-Jacobite parties. Both Coningsby and Sydney probably sought to ensure that they were remembered in English politics, but it was the senior partner, Sydney, who was recalled to London in December to become a secretary of state.<br>
<br>For ten days Coningsby had sole charge of the government of Ireland, but on 23 December he was joined as lord justice by Sir Charles Porter, lord chancellor of Ireland, who had briefly held office under James II. They governed Ireland together until August 1692; Porter's role may have been to moderate Coningsby's hostility towards the Irish and Catholics, and encourage a form of compromise, while Coningsby, a member of the Irish protestant Loftus family on his mother's side, represented the protestant interest. For the first half of their tenure their task was to assist Ginckel in ridding Ireland of the Jacobite army which had been raised by James II's lord lieutenant, Richard Talbot, duke of Tyrconnell. While Ginckel won a series of victories Coningsby concentrated on the political offensive, advertising the generous terms offered by William and Mary to Catholics while attempting to avoid alienating protestant support. Following the capture of Galway on 21 July 1691 Coningsby joined Ginckel at Nenagh, where for nearly a fortnight they discussed the terms to be agreed with the Jacobites when they surrendered Limerick. After the cessation of hostilities at Limerick, on 1 October 1691, Coningsby and Porter joined Ginckel outside the city. There Coningsby and Ginckel's secretary, George Clarke, worked late into the night on the proposed settlement. They rejected the &#145;long scroll&#146; of suggested terms, drawn up by Jacobite bishops and lawyers, which would have granted Irish Catholics political and religious liberty and restored landholdings to the settlement of Charles II's reign, and completed a draft of the military and civil articles. The military articles offered the Jacobite army the opportunity to leave for service under Louis XIV, the freedom to return to their homes and live peaceably under William, or to fight for William's army. The civil articles were controversial as a clause seen and agreed to by the Irish, offering protection to all those defended by the Irish army in the counties of Limerick, Cork, Clare, Kerry, and Mayo, was omitted in the version transmitted to the English government. Clarke's copy of the draft shows that the clause existed before Coningsby's arrival; Coningsby claimed that he and Clarke had removed the clause, and although his case was supported by the English privy council the clause was approved and applied by the Irish parliament. The treaty of Limerick divided the protestant community: when Coningsby and Porter returned to Dublin they heard on successive Sundays sermons from Anthony Dopping, bishop of Meath, condemning the treaty, and from William Moreton, bishop of Kildare, endorsing it.<br>
<br>Encouraged by the government in London, and in particular by Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham, secretary of state, Coningsby and Porter set about restoring the connived toleration of Catholics and dissenters that had existed under Charles II, while preserving the broad hegemony of Church of Ireland protestantism. Their policy was set forward in a proclamation by Mary II, but was frustrated by the opposition of dominant figures in the Irish ecclesiastical establishment. These included Bishop Dopping, Robert Fitzgerald, and Sir Francis Brewster, who were helped by their country whig allies in the English parliament at Westminster, led by Goodwin Wharton, who by the English <span class="roman">Irish Oaths Act</span> of 1691 restricted all places in the government of Ireland to Anglicans.<br>
<br>In January 1692 Coningsby and Porter began to restore estates to those who came under the provisions of the treaty of Limerick. This was one of the most successful and conciliatory aspects of Williamite policy in Ireland, leading to about 1200 successful claims by 1699, principally from Catholics. In February 1692 Coningsby learned that Sydney was returning to Ireland as lord lieutenant, and in March was told by Sydney that he was to be made an Irish peer with responsibility for the management of the Lords in the coming parliament. On 5 March King William signed the warrant for Coningsby's Irish peerage and also one appointing him an Irish privy councillor once he ceased to be a lord justice.<br>
<br>Sydney's parliament met in Chichester House, Dublin, on 5 October 1692, and the same day Coningsby took his seat as Baron Coningsby of Clanbrassil, co. Armagh. Between then and the prorogation of parliament on 3 November Coningsby was active in the Irish Lords, where he chaired the grand committee on new means of raising revenue, and was one of only two peers to attend every sitting of the house. It was rumoured that Sydney prorogued the parliament lest Coningsby might be impeached by critics of the treaty of Limerick. Immediately after the prorogation he was sent to London by Sydney to report on proceedings in parliament, but Lady Coningsby remained in Dublin until after 11 March 1693.<h2>
<a name="ManagerintheCommonsforWilliamIII"></a>Manager in the Commons for William III</h2>In London Coningsby resumed his place as member for Leominster in the House of Commons at Westminster, where he was soon called on to vindicate the actions of the Irish administration. The army in Ireland had been accused of extorting money from property owners. Coningsby admitted that there were &#145;great misdemeanours committed by the army in Ireland&#146; but that &#145;power then was in the general of the army and not in the civil power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell</span>, 252). Coningsby thereby transferred the blame for the army's misconduct to Ginckel, nimbly distancing the civil administration of Ireland from William's continental generals. In December 1692, following the sudden death of William Harbord, Coningsby was appointed to the lucrative office of vice-treasurer of Ireland on the nomination of Sidney Godolphin, baron and later first earl of Godolphin, then first lord of the Treasury. His appointment emphasized his position as the principal government spokesman on Ireland in the Commons, but also exposed him to further criticism. Early in 1693 he came again under attack in the English parliament from those who were critical of the terms of Limerick. The attack on 22 February was led by Goodwin Wharton, who produced Irish witnesses, including Brewster, but after two days' debate Coningsby &#145;spoke very largely in vindication of himself and very much to the satisfaction of the house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell</span>, 447).<br>
<br>In April 1693 Coningsby was appointed a member of the English privy council. As a member both of the Irish and of the English privy councils he was in a key position for nearly thirty years on the two bodies which, under the terms of Poynings' law, controlled the drafting of all Irish legislation. The same month he was promised a royal pardon for anything which he may have done amiss in Ireland. But in June 1693 his critics returned to the attack. On 24 June Richard Coote, first earl of Bellamont (who was also a member of the Commons at Westminster), and James Hamilton of Tullymore asked the privy council in London to delay his pardon, and on 16 December Bellamont attempted a full scale impeachment of Coningsby and Porter for high treason. On 22 December witnesses were heard, their evidence was discussed on 29 December, on 20 January 1694 Coningsby and Porter replied, and on 24 January the Commons decided that there was no case to answer. They reserved as an exception the condemnation at the Irish privy council of Gaffney, a Dublin farmer involved in the murder of a soldier who had been hanged on Coningsby's orders without a proper trial, but allowed that Coningsby's action was extenuated by the circumstances of the time. Coningsby became known as &#145;Gaffney's hangman&#146;.<br>
<br>By this time Coningsby had become a member of an inner cabinet of ministers and confidential advisers to William III that met to formulate policy and plan the management of parliament. In September 1694 he joined William in Flanders, where they discussed the appointment of a lord lieutenant of Ireland. Queen Mary, whose mother, Anne Hyde, was a kinswoman of Lady Coningsby's father, died on 28 December 1694, and in political changes that followed Coningsby lost the vice-treasurership of Ireland to his mother's kinsman, Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan. He did not attend the parliament which met under Henry Capel, Baron Capel of Tewkesbury, lord deputy, in Dublin in August 1695, but concentrated on his role as a government manager in the English Commons. In December 1697 he successfully, but narrowly, won a vote on his motion that the Commons should debate the question of supply only and not the speech from the throne as a whole, thereby helping the government preserve a substantial land force in peacetime.<br>
<br>Coningsby's first wife had died shortly before 9 November 1697. In March 1698 it was reported that his government colleague <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15072/', "Richard Jones, earl of Ranelagh")</script>, paymaster-general of the forces, had returned home to find &#145;My Lord Coningsby in bed with [Ranelagh's] wife. At which sight he said nothing, but withdrew very civilly, and went downstairs about his business. What consequences this is like to have is not yet talked of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.288). Whatever the truth behind the gossip the upshot may have been Coningsby's second marriage, about 23 April 1698, to Lady Frances Jones (1674&#150;1715), Ranelagh's younger daughter, following which the new Lady Coningsby was disinherited by her father. They had one son, who died after choking on a cherry stone in 1708, and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1698 government changes following the end of the Nine Years' War included Coningsby's reappointment as vice-treasurer of Ireland, and in October he attended parliament in Dublin. In January 1699 he led the government side in the English Commons on the <span class="roman">Disbanding Bill</span>, successfully opposing the measure which would have reduced the size of the army to 7000 men. In December he had to support in the English Commons the bill which deprived him of the Irish estates, including Feltrim and Portmarnock, which he had been granted six years before.<h2>
<a name="Lordtreasurerswhig"></a>Lord treasurer's whig</h2>In the latter part of William's reign Coningsby seems to have followed Godolphin in establishing connections with John Churchill, earl and later duke of Marlborough. James Brydges found him with Godolphin and others at Marlborough's house in October 1700 when Marlborough was expecting to be appointed secretary of state. The alliance helped maintain Coningsby's position as a leader of the government side in the Commons following the accession of Queen Anne in 1702. He remained an intermediary on Irish affairs. In 1703 he attended the Dublin parliament called by James Butler, second duke of Ormond, as lord lieutenant. During discussions of the shaping of the Irish <span class="roman">Penal Bill</span> by the English privy council in December 1703 and January 1704 he argued for the further underpinning of the dominant role of Church of Ireland protestants, and has been credited with making the bill much harsher towards Catholics and protestant dissenters than had been intended by the Irish politicians who drafted it. His own suspicion of Catholicism, moderated by pragmatism in the 1690s, now harmonized with the wishes of Anne and Nottingham to strengthen Anglicanism across the queen's dominions. He was suspicious of high-churchmen, and in 1705 told the Commons that &#145;The greatest danger to the Church &hellip; came from the pulpits themselves&#146;  (Holmes, <span class="italic">Trial</span>, 46). During the debates on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in the 1705&#150;6 session Coningsby attacked the bill's tory opponents as enemies of the protestant succession. He attended the 1707 Dublin parliament.<br>
<br>Coningsby was reckoned one of the foremost &#145;lord treasurer's whigs&#146;, working for Godolphin, Anne's lord treasurer, by managing parliamentary business. During the 1708&#150;9 session of what had become the British parliament he negotiated with opposition whigs to ensure that a recruiting bill to keep the army supplied with troops passed the Commons. He was one of the supporters of John Dolben's motion in the Commons on 12 December 1709 that the house take into consideration the sermons of Henry Sacheverell as seditious pamphlets, and in the debate of 14 December 1709 urged that the bookseller and printer be called to the Commons to account for themselves as well. He was a member of the committee that drew up the articles of Sacheverell's prosecution, and in February 1710 was part of the group that managed the trial on the third article, that in alleging that the Church of England was in danger under the Godolphin&#150;Marlborough administration Sacheverell had placed parliament in contempt and slandered the queen. Following Sacheverell's trial he was in the thick of the attack by ministers on the influence that Abigail Masham had with the queen. The queen's determination to shape a new ministry that included Robert Harley, and Coningsby's attachment to Godolphin, led to his departure from office. Coningsby had inherited a dynastic feud with Harley in Herefordshire, and blamed Harley for weakening the administration following his resignation in 1708. On 8 July Coningsby received &#145;a letter from My Lord Dartmouth, that [the queen] had no more occasion for my service&#146;  (Ellis, 18).<h2>
<a name="Revivalanddecline"></a>Revival and decline</h2>Coningsby, out of office and faced with the ascendancy of the high-church party and opprobrium directed towards the prosecutors of Sacheverell, chose not to stand for parliament in 1710. Like many other whigs he returned from the political wilderness at the accession of George I, whose proclamation he signed in 1714. He was retained as part of George's privy council, reduced from eighty under Anne to thirty-two, and was made lord lieutenant of Herefordshire in November 1714, and lord lieutenant of Radnorshire the next month. He used the lieutenancies to reduce the local influence of the Harley family. At the 1715 election he was reinstated as MP for Leominster. In April 1715 he was one of the secret committee which inquired into the conduct of the negotiators of the treaty of Utrecht. His tough handling of Matthew Prior, who was confined on suspicion of treason, inspired Prior to revenge in the composition of <span class="italic">The Viceroy</span>, in which Prior revived the charges brought against Coningsby in the abortive impeachment twenty years before. In July 1715 Coningsby carried the articles of impeachment of Robert Harley, by then earl of Oxford, up to the Lords. He spoke on behalf of the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span> in 1716, and was rewarded for his services to the whig cause on 18 June 1716 when he was created Baron Coningsby of Coningsby, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In July 1716, before George I left for Hanover, Coningsby submitted to the king his &#145;Account of the state of political parties during the reign of Queen Anne&#146;, in which he blamed Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, and the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span> for many of the troubles of the two previous reigns, and gave his personal account of the events which led to the dismissal of Harley in 1708 and of Godolphin in 1710. Historians in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries undervalued the document, as Coningsby was viewed as an egotistical minor figure who exaggerated his own importance; it was also unfinished, as Coningsby declared his intention of taking his account up to 1716 but ended in 1710. However, his claim that Marlborough came very close to siding with Harley in 1708 against Godolphin is supported by other accounts. Coningsby himself claimed that he had kept the Marlborough&#150;Godolphin alliance together, after threatening Marlborough that the &#145;lord treasurer's whigs&#146; would oppose Harley as chief minister in the Commons. Coningsby's ill feeling towards Lord Oxford and the tories continued to shape his political activity. In 1717 he deliberately withdrew from the Lords before Oxford was discharged. In December 1718, during the debate on the <span class="roman">Bill for Strengthening the Protestant Interest</span>, which would have repealed the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span>, he compared Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, to a biblical false prophet, Balaam. This attempt at wit backfired when Atterbury observed that &#145;Balaam was reproved by his ass, but that he was never reproved by anyone but the Lord Coningsby&#146;  (Bennett, 221) and a contemporary lampoon nicknamed him the &#145;Rochester Pad&#146;. He was created earl of Coningsby on 30 April 1719.<br>
<br>Coningsby had become obsessed with his property and with extending his rights as lord of the manors of Marden and Leominster. His conviction that his father-in-law had abused his estate in his youth may have contributed towards the exclusion of his grandson and heir male from succession to his British peerages. In 1717 he protected his estates by a tripartite indenture, placing them in the hands of trustees but ensuring they would benefit his daughters from his second marriage, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1761), created Viscountess Coningsby of Hampton Court in 1717, and Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1709, <i>d</i>. 1781). The settlement was confirmed by his will in 1724. Meanwhile he attempted to eject freeholders from their properties in Marden and Leominster, arguing that they were his copyhold tenants. On being unable to prove his case in chancery he published a pamphlet maligning lord chancellor Macclesfield, and as a result in January 1721 was stripped of his lieutenancies and imprisoned in the Tower of London for six months, where he was visited by the Marlboroughs.<br>
<br>Coningsby attempted to remain active in politics despite his disgrace. In November 1721, to Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland, he proposed that Sunderland form a coalition with moderate tories and force a general election in which Robert Walpole would be outflanked. After Marlborough's death in 1722 he proposed marriage to the widowed duchess on 20 November; however, the duchess regarded him as deranged, and rejected him. His fall was completed when Leominster corporation persuaded the duke of Chandos to put their case against Coningsby's encroachments before the privy council; the council found in Leominster's favour, and Coningsby was expelled from the privy council on 7 November 1724. He died at Hampton Court on 30 April 1729, and was buried at Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, on 9 May 1729. He was succeeded in his Irish barony by his grandson Richard, second and last Baron Coningsby, who survived only until that December, and in his earldom and estate by his daughter Margaret, on whose death in 1761 the title became extinct; Hampton Court then passed to his younger daughter Frances, the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29488/', "Charles Hanbury Williams (1708&#150;1759)")</script>.<br>
