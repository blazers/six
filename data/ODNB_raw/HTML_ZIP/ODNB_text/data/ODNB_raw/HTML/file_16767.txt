<span class="headword">Lister,  Thomas</span>  (1810&#150;1888), <span class="occ">poet and naturalist</span>, was born at Old Mill, Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 11 February 1810, the youngest of the fourteen children of Joseph Lister, a Quaker gardener and small farmer. From 1821 until 1824 he attended Ackworth School, and afterwards was an assistant to his father until 1832, when he began work in a linen warehouse in Barnsley. During the parliamentary election of 1832 Lister worked actively for the return of Lord Morpeth (afterwards earl of Carlisle) for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and wrote several effective verse squibs in his support. Lord Morpeth offered to obtain for him the postmastership of Barnsley, but, as a Quaker, Lister was unwilling to take the requisite oath.<br>
<br>In 1834 Lister published <span class="italic">Rustic Wreath</span>, a collection of his verses. It was very popular; an edition of 3000 copies was quickly sold. It was followed by <span class="italic">Temperance Rhymes</span> in 1837. In that same year, after visiting Spencer T. Hall at Nottingham, and forming an acquaintance with Ebenezer Elliott, Lister made a walking tour of the Lake District, and journeyed into Scotland, where he met Professor John Wilson (Christopher North), William and Robert Chambers, and William Miller the artist. In 1838 he visited France, Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He forwarded many of the poems, sonnets, and translations which he wrote during this tour to Elliott, and they were published in <span class="italic">Tait's Magazine</span>. In 1839, when the office of postmaster at Barnsley again became vacant, Lister was appointed to it, as a simple affirmation had been substituted for the oath, and he held the post until 31 March 1870. The new security of this position permitted him to marry, on 12 March 1841, Hannah Schofield (1812&#150;1882); they had no children.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic naturalist, Lister regularly contributed meteorological observations and notes on birds to the <span class="italic">Barnsley Chronicle</span>. He was to combine his literary and scientific interests in 1862, with the publication of his <span class="italic">Rhymes of Progress</span>. For many years he was president of the Barnsley Naturalists' Society, and contributed to its collections, and he was a constant attendant and contributor of papers at the annual meetings of the British Association. Accompanying the association to Montreal in 1884, he visited the principal towns in Canada and the United States.<br>
<br>Lister died at Barnsley on 25 March 1888, and was buried on 29 March in the Friends' meeting-house ground in Cockerham Road, Barnsley.<br>
