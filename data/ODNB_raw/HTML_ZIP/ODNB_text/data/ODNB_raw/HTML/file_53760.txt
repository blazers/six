<span class="headword">Bunsen,  Christian Karl Josias  von</span>, Baron von Bunsen in the Prussian nobility  (1791&#150;1860), <span class="occ">diplomatist and scholar</span>, was born on 25 August 1791 in Korbach, in the German principality of Waldeck, the only child of Heinrich Christian Bunsen (1743&#150;1820), a regimental officer, and his second wife, Johannette Eleonore, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brocken. Bunsen had two half-sisters through his father's first marriage; his family was not of aristocratic origin. After a grammar school education in Korbach (from 1798), Bunsen moved on to read theology and philology first in Marburg (in 1808) and later in G&ouml;ttingen (from 1809). These studies culminated in a prize essay, the <span class="italic">Athenian Law of Inheritance</span>, for which the University of Jena granted him an honorary doctorate in 1812.<br>
<br>The years from 1812 to 1816 were a period of wide-ranging scholarly activities: Bunsen studied Persian, Icelandic, and Arabic in Munich, Leiden, Paris, and Copenhagen. During this time the idea of writing a universal history focusing on &#145;the Germanic nations, the ancient Greeks and Romans, and (for the earliest period) the Median-Persian-Indian race&#146;  (Bunsen, 1.88) also took shape in his mind. On the basis of work in comparative philology Bunsen intended his research to branch out into religion, literature, law, and philosophy. Early in 1816 this life-plan found the approval of the classical scholar Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776&#150;1831), to whom Bunsen paid a visit in Berlin at that time; Niebuhr's influence on Bunsen's life and work can hardly be overestimated.<br>
<br>When Niebuhr became Prussian envoy to the papal court in 1816 he succeeded in drawing Bunsen into the diplomatic service, even though Bunsen was more inclined to an academic career. He arrived in Rome in November 1816 and was quickly integrated into the vibrant community of German artists and intellectuals residing in the city. He also became friendly with Benjamin Waddington (<i>d</i>. 1828) of Llanofer, a country gentleman and magistrate who was spending the winter in Rome with his wife, Georgina Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Port (1771&#150;1850), and his daughters. On 1 July 1817 Bunsen married Waddington's eldest daughter and coheir, Frances [<a name="cosubject_3945"></a><span class="headword">Frances  von Bunsen</span>, Baroness von Bunsen in the Prussian nobility  (1791&#150;1876)], <span class="occ">hostess and biographer</span>, in the chapel of Niebuhr's residence, the Palazzo Savelli. The couple had ten children, five sons and five daughters, including the biblical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32170/', "Ernest Christian Ludwig de Bunsen")</script>. Born at Dunston Park, Berkshire, on 4 March 1791 and educated by her mother at Llanofer, Frances von Bunsen did not visit her native country for twenty-one years after her marriage. A dedicated mother, she shared her husband's strong Christian convictions. She also contributed to her husband's career: her British background allowed Bunsen to penetrate to the heart of the high-powered English community. Many of the friendships he and his wife built up in the early years of their marriage turned out to be of great importance in their later life.<br>
<br>Bunsen's appointment as secretary to the Prussian legation in 1818 marked the beginning of a new phase in his life: henceforth his scholarly ambitions had to compete with the demands of the Prussian civil service. In 1823 he succeeded Niebuhr as Prussian minister to the Vatican and held this position until he left Rome in 1838. Bunsen's twenty-two years in Rome were characterized by a variety of activities. His household in the Palazzo Caffarelli on the Capitol deserves to be mentioned as an international social meeting-point for artists and intellectuals. Visitors included, among others, the painter Johann Friedrich Overbeck, the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, the poet and scholar Giacomo Leopardi, as well as Thomas Arnold, Julius Hare, Connop Thirlwall, Philip Pusey, and Sir Walter Scott from Britain. Bunsen managed to maintain his scholarly interests by co-authoring a work entitled <span class="italic">Description of Rome</span> (1830), which surveyed the city's ancient, medieval, and modern cultural treasures. He also developed an interest in Egyptian antiquities, which eventually led to the publication of <span class="italic">Egypt's Place in Universal History</span> (1848&#150;67). Bunsen's 1828 proposal to found an archaeological institute can be perceived as an outcome of these endeavours. In addition he was closely associated with the establishment of a protestant infirmary. Both institutions outlived his stay in Rome.<br>
<br>Bunsen's concern with religious matters during his years in Rome had far-reaching consequences. In order to facilitate daily worship he wished to revive the hymns of German reformers and to provide for his countrymen a work comparable to the English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. His compilation of ancient hymns and prayers was first printed in 1833. Selections of this work were translated into English by Catherine Winkworth (1827&#150;1878) in 1855 and became well known under the title <span class="italic">Lyra Germanica</span>; its various editions greatly influenced protestant worship in nineteenth-century England. Bunsen's involvement in religious questions also had a more political nature, which ultimately led to his departure from Rome. A diplomatic crisis between Berlin and the Vatican arose over the disagreement about the possibility of marriages between protestants and Catholics: while such &#145;mixed&#146; marriages were allowed by Prussian law, the Vatican became increasingly determined to abolish them. The failure of Bunsen's mediating efforts in this matter led to his resignation in April 1838.<br>
<br>During a first sojourn in England from August 1838 to October 1839 Bunsen pursued his scholarly interests, visited many of the Englishmen he had met in Rome, and saw a great deal of Elizabeth Fry, Frederick Denison Maurice, and William Ewart Gladstone. On 12 June 1839 Bunsen received an honorary DCL from the University of Oxford. In October of the same year he returned to the continent in order to become ambassador to Switzerland, where he and his family stayed until the spring of 1841. At that time Bunsen was summoned from Bern to Berlin in order to discuss the possibility of an Anglo-German bishopric in Jerusalem with Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Owing to his successful negotiations in London in this matter, this bishopric was controversially founded as the expression of a joint effort of the two great protestant powers in Europe to improve the situation of Christians in the Holy Land.<br>
<br>After this diplomatic success Bunsen was appointed Prussian ambassador to the court of St James in 1842. During his time in this office, which he held until 1854, Bunsen maintained close connections with Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Bunsen's ambassadorial activities were wide-ranging, and included the organization of royal visits as well as the foundation of a German hospital in London in 1844. His fascination with the English parliamentary system was reflected in the advice he gave to Friedrich Wilhelm IV in constitutional matters. He also took a keen interest in educational and cultural issues, initiated translation activity, and increased his connections and his popularity in England by travelling extensively. As in Rome, Frances von Bunsen's active support of her husband's ambassadorial career, evidenced in the warm hospitality received by their many guests, put the couple at the centre of a wide social and cultural network: their London home in Carlton Terrace was a popular meeting-place for celebrities from many European countries.<br>
<br>On a scholarly level Bunsen promoted Niebuhr's innovative research in Roman history, which greatly influenced nineteenth-century English historiography. His enthusiasm was shared by three of his closest English friends: Thomas Arnold (1795&#150;1842), Julius Hare (1795&#150;1855), and Connop Thirlwall (1797&#150;1875). Bunsen also kept up his interest in philological work and introduced his countryman Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller to the scholarly resources in oriental studies in England. In the theological debates of his time Bunsen was a decided antagonist of the high-church party. As a result he was frequently associated with historicist German biblical criticism in the tradition of David Friedrich Strauss, and his research in this field was so widely known that a defence of his opinions by the broad-churchman Rowland Williams was included in <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860). The seven volumes of Bunsen's <span class="italic">Christianity and Mankind</span> (1854), which can be perceived as a development of the ideas about universal history presented to Niebuhr at the outset of his career, were published at the end of Bunsen's stay in England. In 1853 Bunsen received an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In a political context Bunsen supported the plans for German unification and did his utmost to foster English support for the union of Germany under the leadership of Prussia, thus aiming for an intimate alliance between the two countries. On two occasions, however, he could not reach an agreement between Prussian and English interests. In 1852 he was forced to sign a protocol about the abrogation of the constitutional independence of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein from Denmark, which he had defended in a printed memoir presented to Lord Palmerston in 1848. A second political tension between England and Prussia arose at the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853. Bunsen advised his king to join the western alliance of France and England. Friedrich Wilhelm IV, however, had an aversion to Napoleon III and mistrusted Palmerston's political principles. As a result he preserved neutrality towards Russia and accepted Bunsen's offer to resign his post as minister in London in April 1854.<br>
<br>After their return to Germany in June of the same year Bunsen and his wife settled in a villa near Heidelberg, where he passed most of his remaining years with literary work. The year 1855 saw the publication of the book translated into English as <span class="italic">Signs of the Times</span> (1856), which exercised a great influence in reviving the liberal movement in the German states after the failure of the revolution of 1848. In another important work (1868&#150;70), translated as <span class="italic">God in History</span>, Bunsen explored how the progress of mankind is reflected in the conception of God formed within each nation. Bunsen's authorship was prolific and his output includes further books, articles, lectures, and political pamphlets within the wide scope of the interests covered in his major publications. Many of them appeared in German and English. During a visit to Berlin in September 1857 Friedrich Wilhelm IV raised Bunsen to the rank of baron and conferred upon him a life peerage.<br>
<br>In 1858 Bunsen's health began to fail and he suffered increasingly from the symptoms of chronic heart disease. The last two winters of his life were spent in Cannes, and in 1860, after having given up the house in Heidelberg, Bunsen and his wife arrived in their new home in Bonn, where he spent the last months of his life. As far as his health allowed, he still pursued his scholarly interests and was surrounded by his family and friends. Bunsen died on 28 November 1860 in Bonn and was buried there on 1 December 1860.<br>
<br>In response to one of her husband's last requests Frances von Bunsen wrote <span class="italic">A Memoir of Baron Bunsen, Drawn Chiefly from Family Papers</span> (1868), published in German and English and showing her linguistic and literary talent. After her husband's death she moved to Karlsruhe, where she looked after the children of her deceased daughter Theodora, Baroness von Ungern Sternberg. Her family and friends were dispersed in many European countries; she kept in touch with them in visits and letters, which showed her intimate knowledge of the political and cultural events of her time. She died in Waldhorn Strasse, Karlsruhe, surrounded by many of her children and grandchildren, on 23 April 1876, and was buried next to her husband in Bonn.<br>
