<span class="headword">Boyle,  Henry</span>, first earl of Shannon  (1681<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1764), <span class="occ">speaker of the Irish House of Commons</span>, was born in Castlemartyr, co. Cork, Ireland, the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Boyle (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1693) of Castlemartyr and Mary O'Brien, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20463/', "Murrough O'Brien, first earl of Inchiquin (c.1614&#150;1674)")</script>, the commander of protestant forces in Munster in the 1640s. His father was killed in Flanders in 1693 while fighting with the duke of Marlborough's army. He was a member of the Church of Ireland, and was educated at Westminster School, where he became queen's scholar in 1702, and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in March 1705; both institutions were high tory and had strong connections with the Boyle family. In 1705 he succeeded to the family estate, a minor one within the Cork Boyle family, after the death of his older brother, Roger. He served as MP for Midleton, co. Cork, from 7 July 1707 to 2 November 1713, then for Kilmallock, co. Limerick, from November 1713 to October 1714, and finally for co. Cork from October 1715 until 17 May 1756. He was sworn of the privy council on 28 April 1733 and in November 1733 was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, a post which he held for three separate periods. He was elected speaker of the Irish House of Commons on 4 October 1733 and sat in the chair until 17 April 1756, when he went to the Lords. He was appointed to the Irish revenue board on 12 September 1735 and was first commissioner until 5 April 1739. He was also a long-serving lord justice, holding that position fifteen times between 1734 and 1764. On 16 April 1756 he was made baron of Castlemartyr, Viscount Boyle of Brandon, and earl of Shannon and was granted a &pound;2000 per annum pension for thirty-one years.<br>
<br>Boyle continued the rebuilding work at Castlemartyr, which had been destroyed in 1689, and he improved the demesne and the borough town, preferring this to his Dublin residence in Henrietta Street. He was awarded an honorary degree of LLD from Trinity College, Dublin, in July 1735 and, on his being raised to the peerage, was given the position of governor of co. Cork on 3 May 1756. Boyle married twice, first in 1715 to Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1725), daughter of Childly Coote and his wife, Catharine Sandys, of Killester, co. Limerick; she died childless on 5 May 1725. Then he married a distant cousin, Henrietta Boyle (1701&#150;1746), sister of the third earl of Burlington and youngest daughter of Charles Boyle, second earl of Burlington, and his wife, Juliana Noel, on 22 September 1726. They had five sons (three of whom died young) and one daughter; Henrietta Boyle died on 13 December 1746. The children included Boyle's heir, Richard (1728&#150;1807), who became second earl of Shannon in December 1764.<br>
<br>For a thirty-year period from 1734 to 1764 Boyle was perhaps the leading Irish politician in both the House of Commons and Dublin Castle. He was described as a deep politician; in appearance he was most open, and in reality most reserved. Contemporaries often underestimated him, mistaking country gentleman manners and a preference for residence in Castlemartyr over fashionable Henrietta Street as a sign of bucolic indifference. Boyle was, however, the most effective undertaker or Irish parliamentary manager before 1800, with his wielding of patronage, his electoral interest, and, above all, his sense of his own and other MPs' honour. He owed his political power primarily to his Commons following, estimated in 1753 at a total of forty members. His interest was not based on his own land, although he controlled the boroughs of Castlemartyr and Clonakilty in co. Cork, but on his family connections and political guile. One of his connections was with the Brodrick family, later viscounts Midleton and absentees, who first returned him as an MP. By the late 1720s he had become the manager of both their interest in co. Cork and also, through marriage, of the interest of the third earl of Burlington. By 1729, when the Commons speaker William Conolly died, Boyle considered standing as his successor but did not. Four years later he was strong enough to be the unrivalled candidate with his &#145;Munster squadron&#146; of MPs, so named at the time because of their regional base in counties Cork and Waterford. He married to this parliamentary strength his control of the Irish revenue board in the 1730s, which gave him patronage over a thousand minor posts. He soon gave up his revenue post, however, and relied instead on his influence in the Commons, thus making him a different type of undertaker from William Conolly or John Ponsonby. His appointment as lord justice for the first of many times in 1734 and then as chancellor of the exchequer, a sinecure worth &pound;800 per annum, marked his recognized place in the Dublin Castle administration after that date.<br>
<br>Boyle's period as speaker and chief undertaker was largely a quiet one because there was no serious threat of a money bill between 1733 and 1753. Despite this, successive viceroys all distrusted him, partly because he openly opposed unpopular government measures, like the unsuccessful effort to introduce regulations to stop the smuggling of wool to France in 1741, and partly due to his indispensability. This distrust began with the duke of Dorset in 1733, who hesitated about appointing the new speaker of the Commons one of his lords justices, especially after Boyle refused to support legislation to repeal the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. His relationship with subsequent viceroys during the 1730s and 1740s was one of cautiousness on both sides and was marked by his refusal to break fully with his country's past; for example, he demanded and gained government support both for popular anti-Catholic measures and for the use of crown revenues to aid the Irish economy and the local interests of the gentry through the building of canals, the spreading of tillage, and the development of linen manufacturing. The good relations broke down after 1750 with the premature attempt of the duke of Dorset to replace Boyle as speaker and lord justice in order to satisfy the ambitions of Archbishop George Stone and the Ponsonby family. Boyle was now in his sixties and the prospect of retirement must have appealed. However, he chose to resist and a battle soon ensued over the rights of the Irish parliament to dispose of the revenues it raised and also over the use, by Boyle and his allies, of a growing Anglophobia among Irish protestants inside and outside parliament. After the money bill was rejected in the 1753&#150;4 session the Dublin parliament was prorogued by Dorset, and Boyle was dismissed from all his government offices. Yet, with the prospect of war with France and the worries about another disrupted parliamentary session, Dorset was replaced in March 1755 and the new viceroy, the marquess of Hartington, was authorized to negotiate a settlement with Boyle. The outcome of this was his retirement as speaker and his creation as first earl of Shannon in April 1756. Boyle's patriotism had been called into question several times by pamphleteers during the 1750s crisis and his 1756 settlement was compared with William Pulteney's apostasy in the wake of Walpole's fall in 1742. Despite this vocal criticism he kept his electoral interest intact and was persuaded to return as a lord justice in April 1758 in order to prop up the administration of the duke of Bedford. Although he served as a lord justice for another three terms this was in order to give the government extra parliamentary credibility rather than to enable him to remain an active politician.<br>
<br>Shannon died from an attack of gout in the head on 27 December 1764 at his home in Henrietta Street, Dublin, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 31 December. By the time of his death he had created a remarkable rise in fortunes for his branch of the Cork family, coming from minor beginnings to create an electoral interest and landed estate which survived him.<br>
