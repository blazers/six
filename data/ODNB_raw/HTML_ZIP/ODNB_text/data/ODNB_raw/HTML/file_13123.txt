<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hesilrige <span class="st"> [Haselrig]</span>, Sir  Arthur</span>, second baronet  (1601&#150;1661), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born at Noseley, Leicestershire, the second son of Sir Thomas Hesilrige, baronet (<i>d</i>. 1630), of Noseley, and his wife, Frances, daughter of William Gorges of Alderton, Northamptonshire. He matriculated as a fellow-commoner from Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1617 and was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1623. In 1624 Hesilrige married his first wife, Frances, daughter of Thomas Elmes of Lilford, Northamptonshire. On his father's death in 1630 he succeeded to both the family baronetcy and its extensive midlands estates. In 1632 his first wife died and two years later he married Dorothy, daughter of Fulke Greville of Thorpe Latimer in Lincolnshire, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11518/', "Robert Greville, second Baron Brooke (1607&#150;1643)")</script>. His republican associate Edmund Ludlow commented of his character that he was &#145;a man of disobliging carriage, sower [sour] and morose of temper, liable to be transported with passion, and to whom liberality seemed to be a vice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.133&#150;4). Ludlow also, however, pointed to &#145;the rectitude and sincerity of his intentions&#146; and to his constant concern &#145;to prevent arbitrary power wheresoever he knew it to be affected and to keep the sword subservient to the civil magistrate&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="Oppositiontopersonalruleandparliamentarycareerto1642"></a>Opposition to personal rule and parliamentary career to 1642</h2>From the early 1630s Hesilrige's radical political and religious views brought him into conflict with Charles I's personal-rule government. In 1632 he was summoned before the privy council for failing to pay his muster fees. While waiting to make his appearance he reportedly remarked to one of the deputy lieutenants who had presented him: &#145;If such a gentleman as you shall be suffered to shark the country of their money, it will be a very pretty thing&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1631&#150;3</i>, 445&#150;6). He was afterwards forced to kneel before the privy council to ask pardon for this comment and was imprisoned for a short time in the Tower of London. Through his marriage into the Greville family in 1634 he became closely associated with the puritan group led by Lord Saye and Sele and John Pym which was working in secret to oppose Charles I's government. He was heavily involved in this group's colonial ventures and was one of the original patentees of the town of Saybrook in New England. He also seriously considered emigrating to America himself at this stage. In 1635 he quarrelled with William Laud over the payment of some ecclesiastical fees and was forced to appear before the court of high commission on several occasions. In the later 1630s he publicly opposed the collection of ship money in Leicestershire. His objection to government policy during the 1630s seems to have been primarily religious in nature; at the Restoration a hostile commentator argued that religion was the &#145;pretence&#146; of his &#145;discontent&#146;  (Gent).<br>
<br>In 1640 Hesilrige was returned to both the Short and Long parliaments as one of the knights of the shire for Leicestershire, and during the next eighteen months he remained a close associate of Pym and the other leaders of the opposition to Charles I's government. He strongly supported the moves to bring Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, to trial, and when the impeachment proceedings against Strafford appeared to be faltering in the spring of 1641 he advocated the drawing up of a bill of attainder as an alternative way of finding him guilty of treason by statute. This was a very radical tactic about which initially even Pym was hesitant. Hesilrige was also one of the fiercest parliamentary critics of the Laudian church. In May 1641, following the defeat of a bill to exclude the bishops from the House of Lords, he joined with Oliver Cromwell and Sir Henry Vane in introducing into the House of Commons a bill to abolish bishops altogether. The bill was given a second reading, but was abandoned later that year. In December 1641 Hesilrige introduced the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> into the House of Commons and the following month he was one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94998', "five members")</script> whom Charles I accused of treason and attempted to arrest in the Commons' chamber.<h2>
<a name="Civilwarregicideandrepublic"></a>Civil war, regicide and republic</h2>On the outbreak of the first civil war in 1642 Hesilrige raised a troop of horse for parliament and in October 1642 he fought at the battle of Edgehill as part of the regiment of Sir William Balfour. By 1643 he was serving as the second in command to Sir William Waller and his regiment of cuirassiers, known as the lobsters because of their three-quarter armour, and fought at both Lansdowne and Roundway Down. In both these battles he and his men were in the thick of the action; Hesilrige himself was wounded on both occasions and nearly died of the injuries he sustained during the second engagement. In 1644 he fought at Cheriton and the second battle of Newbury.<br>
<br>Away from the battlefield Hesilrige played an active part in political developments at Westminster. Following Pym's death at the end of 1643, he for a time assumed the leadership of the war party in parliament. In the winter of 1644&#150;5 he backed Oliver Cromwell in his quarrel with the earl of Manchester and in early 1645 he supported the self-denying ordinance, thereafter laying down his military commission. During the abortive peace negotiations at Uxbridge in 1645 one of parliament's terms for a settlement was that Hesilrige should be made a lord and given lands worth &pound;2000 a year. Following the parliamentarian victory in the first civil war, Hesilrige took the side of the New Model Army in its quarrel with parliament. He was believed to have persuaded William Lenthall, the speaker of the Commons, to join the army in 1647, and after the New Model had arrived in the capital in the late summer he helped to organize the ejection from the Commons of its most prominent presbyterian critics.<br>
<br>In December 1647 Hesilrige was appointed governor of Newcastle and given overall responsibility for the military forces in that region. His duties in the north kept him away from London during the crucial revolutionary months of December 1648 and January 1649. He was opposed to the army's purge of parliament and, despite his republican sympathies, did not support its subsequent decision to put Charles I on trial. He turned down an invitation to sit as one of the king's judges and subsequently refused to sign the engagement, the oath of loyalty to the new regime. He none the less took up his seat in the Rump in late February 1649, and subsequently became a prominent member of the government of the republic, serving as a member of the council of state until 1653. While he was critical of the Rump Parliament's reluctance to embrace constitutional reform, he strongly supported its constitutional role and backed it in its power struggle with the army during 1652. He vehemently opposed the army's forcible dissolution of the Rump in April 1653 and thereafter remained a bitter opponent of Cromwell and the protectorate.<h2>
<a name="Controlofthenortheast"></a>Control of the north-east</h2>Throughout the period from 1647 to the mid-1650s Hesilrige was governor of Newcastle and as such was one of the most powerful men in the counties of Durham and Northumberland. Following his appointment he quickly established his authority over this area and helped to keep it secure for parliament during the second civil war and the invasion of the Scots in 1648. At the beginning of July 1648 he defeated a force of Northumbrian royalists under the command of Colonel Edward Grey, and the following month he recaptured the castle at Tynemouth, after its garrison commander, Henry Lilburne, had defected to the king. In October 1648 he accompanied Cromwell to Edinburgh. He was again with him in Scotland during the 1650 campaign and was given charge of the Scottish prisoners following the English victory at Dunbar.<br>
<br>Hesilrige remained powerful in the north-east of England throughout the early 1650s and amassed a large personal fortune by purchasing lands which had been sequestered from local royalists and the bishop of Durham; his acquisitions included the manors of Bishop's Auckland, Easington, and Wolsingham, which between them cost him in the region of &pound;19,000. During his period of pre-eminence in the north-east he was frequently accused of corruption and of dishonestly using his power to enrich himself. In 1650 John Musgrave published a tract entitled <span class="italic">A true and exact relation of the great and heavy pressures and grievances the well affected of the northern bordering counties lye under, by Sir Arthur Haslerigs misgovernment</span>, in which he labelled him the &#145;Nimrod of the North&#146;  (Musgrave, 1) and accused him of appointing delinquents to positions of power and of acquiring a vast personal fortune by extortion and the purchase of sequestered lands at a fraction of their true worth. Hesilrige was similarly accused by John Hedworth in <span class="italic">The Oppressed Man's Outcry</span> of acting unjustly and oppressively to gain control of some collieries at Harraton in Durham which had been confiscated from the Hedworth family. He also became involved in a protracted lawsuit with the Collingwood family about the rightful ownership of the manor of Esslington in Northumberland, with the courts eventually deciding against him.<br>
<br>In 1649 the Leveller leader John Lilburne claimed in the tract <span class="italic">A Preparative to an Hue and Cry after Sir Arthur Haslerig</span> that Hesilrige had attempted to murder him and had cheated him out of about &pound;2400 &#145;by the meer power of his own will&#146;  (Lilburne, 1). Lilburne asserted that Hesilrige had &#145;overstept&#146; even Charles I's hated minister, Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, by &#145;traitorously subverting the fundamentall liberties of England and (in time of peace) exercising an arbitrary and tyrannical government over and above law&#146;  (ibid.). Two years later Lilburne again accused him of conducting a vendetta against his father and uncle, Richard and George Lilburne, and of unjustly sequestering some of the family's lands in Durham. In early 1652 a committee of the Rump declared that Lilburne's charges were false and sentenced the Leveller to a heavy fine and banishment. Hesilrige could also be extremely uncompromising in his dealings with the royalist clergy; on one occasion he ejected Alexander Davison and his family from the rectory of Norham in the middle of the night, throwing their belongings in the churchyard.<br>
<br>Following the establishment of the protectorate in December 1653 and Hesilrige's decision to break with Cromwell, he lost influence in the north. His dominance passed to Robert Lilburne and Charles Howard, who acted as governors of York and Carlisle respectively, and as John Lambert's deputies as major-generals for the north in 1655 and 1656.<h2>
<a name="ProtectorateandRestoration"></a>Protectorate and Restoration</h2>Throughout the period from 1653 to 1658 Hesilrige remained an implacable opponent of Oliver Cromwell and his protectoral state. He refused to pay taxes not sanctioned by parliament and on several occasions had his property distrained as a result. In September 1654 he was elected to the first protectorate parliament as one of the members for Leicestershire, and in the early days of the session was one of the government's most outspoken critics. Edmund Ludlow remarked that during this period he was &#145;very instrumental in opening the eyes of many young members who had never before heard their interest so clearly stated; so that the commonwealth-party increased daily and that of the sword lost ground&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.391). When these activities prompted Cromwell to intervene and to demand that the MPs subscribe to a recognition of the government, Hesilrige refused to do so and subsequently withdrew from Westminster. Two years later he was again elected as MP for Leicestershire, for the second protectorate parliament. On this occasion he was excluded even before the assembly had met, and subsequently signed a protest about this action. In late 1657 Cromwell appointed him to the newly established other house, but he refused to accept this position and when the parliament reassembled for its brief second session in January 1658 he provocatively took up his seat in the Commons. Once again he proved a fierce critic of the government, attacking in particular the new second chamber as unconstitutional and unrepresentative.<br>
<br>Following Oliver Cromwell's death in September 1658, Hesilrige was elected to Richard Cromwell's parliament, once again as member for Leicestershire. He continued to attack the protectorate, and spoke against recognizing Richard as the new head of state. By the early spring of 1659 he appears to have been conspiring with the leaders of the army to bring down the regime and he was one of those behind the army's declaration calling for the recall of the Rump. Following Richard Cromwell's resignation and the subsequent return of the Rump, Hesilrige once more began to play a very prominent role in public affairs. He was a member of both the committee of safety and the council of state. He effectively controlled parliamentary proceedings and took part in the appointment of army officers. He was also put in command of a regiment which had been taken away from Charles Howard.<br>
<br>Hesilrige soon, however, fell out with his new army colleagues, both by exaggerating the constitutional authority of parliament and by taking insufficient notice of the concerns of the military with regard to appointments and indemnity. He was also very suspicious of John Lambert, whom he suspected of wanting to re-establish a military regime and to assume power himself. He was behind the move in parliament to cashier Lambert and seven other officers, an action which in turn persuaded Lambert forcibly to close the Rump for a second time. Following Lambert's putsch, Hesilrige based himself at Portsmouth and attempted to gather together a force to resist him. After the Rump had met again in late December 1659, he returned to London and resumed his position on the council of state.<br>
<br>A close ally of George Monck, whose march from Scotland to London had precipitated the return of parliamentary government, Hesilrige was slow to realize that Monck did not share his republican outlook and was considering recalling Charles Stuart from exile. When he did come to see the way events were leading, he attempted to dissuade Monck from this course of action. According to some reports he tried to persuade him to take the crown himself, before dropping his opposition in return for a promise that his own life would be spared following a restoration of the monarchy. After Charles II's return in May 1660, Hesilrige was none the less exempted from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He died six months later, on 7 January 1661, before he could be brought to trial for treason. A short character sketch published at the Restoration labelled him as a &#145;church-thief&#146; and denounced him for his enthusiastic iconoclasm and plundering of church wealth.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandinfluence"></a>Reputation and influence</h2>Hesilrige was one of the most committed and prominent republicans within mid-seventeenth-century England. He remained throughout his career a staunch supporter of the rights of the English parliament, and he opposed with equal vigour what he regarded as the unrepresentative rule of both Charles I in the 1630s and Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. While he was undoubtedly a man of great courage and strong political and religious principles, he gained an unfortunate, but probably justified, contemporary reputation as someone who took advantage of the positions of power he enjoyed in the 1640s and 1650s both to oppress his enemies and to enrich himself. This inclination towards bullying and greed confirmed the worst prejudices of his conservative enemies about the character and origins of republicanism and did much to discredit it as a political philosophy.<br>
