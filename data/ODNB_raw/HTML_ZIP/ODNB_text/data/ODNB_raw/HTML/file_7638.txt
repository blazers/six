<span class="headword">Digges,  Leonard</span>  (1588&#150;1635), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was born in London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7639/', "Thomas Digges (c.1546&#150;1595)")</script>, mathematician, and Anne (or Agnes), daughter of Sir Warham St Leger. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7635/', "Sir Dudley Digges (1582/3&#150;1639)")</script> was his brother. After Thomas Digges's death his widow married Thomas Russell of Alderminster, whom in 1616 William Shakespeare named as an overseer of his will. The remarriage of his mother had literary repercussions for Leonard Digges. He went to University College, Oxford, in 1603, aged fifteen, and graduated BA on 31 October 1606. Having left Oxford, he returned briefly to London before embarking on a period of study in foreign universities. In 1611 it seems that he went to Spain with his friend James Mabbe, a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, who was secretary to the English ambassador, Sir John Digby. The evidence for their companionship in Spain is provided by a copy of Lope de Vega's <span class="italic">Rimas</span> (1613), now in the library of Balliol College, Oxford, which Mabbe sent to another Oxford friend, Will Baker. In a note to Baker on the flyleaf Digges compared Lope's sonnets to those of Shakespeare, which were clearly regarded, at least in Digges's circle, as the finest of their kind. In consideration of the accomplishments Digges acquired in classical and modern languages he was created MA at Oxford on 20 November 1626, and allowed to reside at University College, where he died on 7 April 1635 and was buried in the chapel.<br>
<br>Digges has been lauded as an &#145;eminent-poet&#146;  (Hunter) and his earliest text, a verse translation from Claudius Claudianus's <span class="italic">The Rape of Proserpine</span>, was published in 1617, with further editions appearing in 1628. It is dedicated to Digges's sister (1587&#150;1619), wife of Sir Anthony Palmer KB (1566&#150;1630), who had recently nursed Digges through a &#145;desperate sicknesse&#146;  (L. Digges, <span class="italic">Rape of Proserpine</span>, 1617, sig. A2<i>r</i>) and whose devotion was similarly recorded on her funerary monument in Chilham church, Kent. In 1622 he issued a translation of a Spanish novel by the former prisoner G. de Cespedes y Meneses, entitled <span class="italic">Gerardo, the Unfortunate Spaniard</span>, and dedicated it, admitting that he was a &#145;stranger rather than an intruder&#146;, to the brothers William, earl of Pembroke, and Philip, earl of Montgomery.<br>
<br>In addition Digges composed short verses prefixing a number of texts. The first of these, praising the accuracy and originality of the succeeding narrative, was printed in Matheo Aleman's <span class="italic">The Rogue, or, The Life of Guzman de Alfarache</span> (1623). This work, a highly moral depiction of a linguistically gifted cleric's refusal to heed good counsel, and the subsequent calamities he suffered, was followed in 1639 by Giovanni Sorriano's <span class="italic">The Italian Tutor, or, A New and most Compleat Italian Grammar</span>. Digges again celebrated the author's skills:<blockquote>
<div>What reader but will say thy paines are such,<br>
</div>
<div>No tongue nor pen can praise too much<br>
</div>
<div>For what although thou mortall quickly die? Thy fame shall live eternally.<br>
</div> (L. Digges, <span class="italic">Italian Tutor</span>, 1639, sig. [a2<i>v</i>])</blockquote>Consolidating his association with the stationer Edward Blount, Digges (like Mabbe) produced commendatory verses prefacing Shakespeare's first folio (1623)&#151;<blockquote>
<div class="indent">This Booke,<br>
</div>
<div>When Brasse and Marble fade, shall make thee looke<br>
</div>
<div>Fresh to all Ages<br>
</div> (sig. A7<i>r</i>)</blockquote>&#151;and the 1640 edition of his <span class="italic">Poems</span>. The latter verses reveal Digges's admiration for the poet's inventive creativity and fame:<blockquote>
<div>Briefe, there is nothing in his wit fraught Booke,<br>
</div>
<div>Whose sound we would not heare; on whose worth looke<br>
</div>
<div>Like old coynd gold, whose lines in every page,<br>
</div>
<div>Shall passe true currant to succeeding age.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
