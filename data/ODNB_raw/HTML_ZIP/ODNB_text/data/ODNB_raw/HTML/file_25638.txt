<span class="headword">Singer,  George John</span>  (1786&#150;1817), <span class="occ">electrical researcher</span>, was the son of Thomas Singer (<i>d</i>. 1793/4), feather and artificial flower maker of 3 Princes Street, Cavendish Square, London, and his wife, Elizabeth Weller. After his father's death Singer helped his mother with the family business, and continued to live at her home, 3 Princes Street. Every spare moment, however, he devoted to scientific study, more particularly to the investigation of electricity and electro-chemistry. He made almost the whole of his apparatus himself, and introduced several improvements, inventing, among other things, the gold leaf electrometer and an electric column comprising 20,000 zinc and silver plates. He also purchased apparatus including a 50 inch diameter electrostatic plate machine that had once belonged to Napoleon, for which he paid &pound;100.<br>
<br>Singer built, almost unassisted, a large room at the back of his mother's house where from at least 1808 he delivered courses of demonstration lectures on electricity and related subjects. From 1810 he also lectured at the Russell Institution and from 1811 he described himself in his papers as &#145;Lecturer on Chemistry and Natural Philosophy&#146;. Among his auditors were Michael Faraday and Francis Ronalds. Singer referred to Ronalds as his pupil and communicated to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> Ronalds's first paper. He also made the acquaintance of the electrician Andrew Crosse with whom he collaborated, staying frequently at Crosse's seat, Fyne Court, Somerset, and walking with him on the Quantocks. In 1814 Singer published <span class="italic">Elements of Electricity and Electro-Chemistry</span>, a work of considerable importance, which was translated into French (Paris, 1817), Italian (Milan, 1819), and German (Breslau, 1819). He died, unmarried, of pulmonary consumption on 28 June 1817 at his mother's house. His collection of apparatus was sold at Stewart's auction room in 1818.<br>
