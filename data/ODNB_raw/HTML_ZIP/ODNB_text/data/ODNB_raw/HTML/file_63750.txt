<span class="headword">Mayer,  Matthew</span>  (1740&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher and promoter of the Sunday school movement</span>, was born on 4 November 1740 at Portwood Hall estate, near Stockport, Cheshire, the son of John Mayer, yeoman farmer (<i>d</i>. 1775), and his wife, Hannah. Educated at a good country school, Matthew had a strictly moral Anglican upbringing. In 1759, affected by illness and the death of an uncle, he became seriously religious, heard John Wesley preach, and joined the Methodists. After three years' struggle he was converted on 1 August 1762 while taking communion. He participated in newly created public prayer meetings around Manchester and began preaching, one of his converts being John Whitehead, a future biographer of Wesley.<br>
<br>In June 1763 Wesley took Mayer to Birmingham and left him in charge of the Methodist circuit for a week, which resulted in conversions and confirmed his call to preach. He resolved not to be an itinerant or local preacher but to accept calls to evangelize new places. For twenty years he preached far afield at weekends and pioneered many causes in Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, south Lancashire, and west Yorkshire. He faced mob violence and had &#145;providential&#146; experiences of facing down mob leaders and &#145;judgements&#146; on opponents. Though some envied his freelance preaching and popularity, he acquired close friendships with Wesley and leading preachers including Thomas Rankin and Joseph Benson. On 1 August 1771 he married Sarah Flower (1748&#150;1825), a devout Methodist and only daughter of Joseph Flower (<i>d</i>. 1785), a Bristol potter. They had at least four children, of whom two survived him. In 1783 he moved to Cale Green near Stockport and thereafter preached mainly in the Stockport area, monthly in Manchester, and occasionally further afield.<br>
<br>Mayer was a leading founder and manager of Stockport Sunday school, later the country's largest institution of this type, which moved into its own premises in 1805. His son Joseph (1773&#150;1857), a pioneer cotton manufacturer in Stockport, was a major force in the school and a public defender of its work and policy. Though originating on Methodist premises the school was undenominational, and taught writing and arithmetic as well as reading. In 1808 Matthew led a formal protest against the Methodist conference's attempt to restrict Sunday schools under Methodist control to reading only. The school became a centre for religion and culture for all ages and a kind of people's church.<br>
<br>Mayer approved of Anglican liturgy and doctrine despite his Methodism and followed the biblical maxims &#145;Fear God and honour the king&#146; and &#145;not to meddle with those who are given to [political] change&#146;. Though supporting Wesley's doctrine of &#145;Christian perfection&#146; he was critical of the claims of some perfectionists. He was respected for honest business dealings, benevolence, and charity. He was a notable example of a local Methodist preacher who nevertheless had a major role as a regional creator of societies. His Sunday school policy exemplified the earlier Methodist tradition of undenominational openness against the growth of tighter denominationalism. Mayer died on 5 November 1814 in Cale Green and was buried in Stockport, where Benson preached memorial sermons in the Methodist chapel and Sunday school.<br>
