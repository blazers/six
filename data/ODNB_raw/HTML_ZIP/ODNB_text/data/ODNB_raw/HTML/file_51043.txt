<span class="headword">Martin of Laon</span> <span class="st"> [Martin Scottus, Martinus Hiberniensis]</span>  (819&#150;875), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was also known as Martin Scottus and called himself Martinus Hiberniensis in the Laon annals, where he recorded his birth date and where a colleague entered his death date. The same source designated Martin as the <i>magister Laundunensis</i> (&#145;master of Laon&#146;). No other personal record of Martin survives and so it must be presumed that he spent his entire career as a master in the cathedral school at Laon. Nothing is known of his early intellectual formation in Ireland or of his arrival on the continent. Unlike most of his compatriots who continued to write Irish pointed minuscule script after they came to the Carolingian kingdoms, Martin mastered Carolingian minuscule, a trait suggestive of training somewhere on the continent.<br>
<br>From the time of Josephus Scottus at the end of the eighth century to that of Israel the Grammarian in the middle of the tenth century, the names of some forty Irish masters are recorded in European sources. As one of these, Martin of Laon's scholarly interests and teaching exemplified the Carolingian reform's emphasis on a programme of studies that exalted the liberal arts as paths to Christian wisdom.<br>
<br>During the third quarter of the ninth century Laon was an important political and ecclesiastical centre in the kingdom of Charles the Bald (<i>r</i>. 840&#150;77). Along with nearby Rheims and Soissons, Laon served as a base for a peripatetic group of Irish masters associated with John Scottus (Eriugena), one of the most important and original scholars of the Carolingian renaissance. Martin incorporated excerpts from John's work into the teaching manuals he composed at Laon and may have known John personally.<br>
<br>Martin was a teacher, not an author. Evidence of his scholarly interests and teaching survives in twenty-one manuscripts that bear his notes and comments. His manuscripts reveal Martin as a collector of books, a compiler of texts, a scribe, and a supervisor of scribes. His collection consists of books primarily in biblical exegesis, the liberal arts, medicine, and Greek. Martin's significance as an early medieval master rests especially on his tutelage in Greek as evidenced by the Greek&#150;Latin glossary and grammar he composed and partially copied  (Laon, Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, MS 444). This massive codex, acclaimed as &#145;the <span class="italic">Thesaurus linguae graecae</span> of its century&#146;  (Bischoff, 2.266), reflects John Scottus's interest in Greek patristic texts and the interest of Charles the Bald's court in Byzantine culture. Excerpts from both the glossary and grammar appear in manuscripts copied at other centres and attest to the influence of Martin's Greek pedagogy. Martin also compiled and partially copied a handbook for the study of the liberal arts and of Virgil  (Laon, Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, MS 468), a manuscript that remained in use at Laon for more than sixty years. Martin instructed his students in computus or time reckoning  (Contreni, &#145;John Scottus and Bede&#146;, 111&#150;31). His contribution to pedagogy in this highly complex and technical field can be traced in his commentary on Bede's <span class="italic">De temporum ratione</span>. As a teacher engaged in the instruction of future priests, Martin also emphasized dogmatic and pastoral matters. He annotated Laon's copy of the prescriptions of the Council of Aachen (816) regulating the lives of cathedral canons  (Laon, Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, MS 336) and put together a collection of texts which bear on the doctrine and practice of Christian life  (Laon, Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, MS 265).<br>
<br>Martin's collection of books passed to the Laon masters, Bernard (847&#150;903) and Adelelm (<i>c</i>.860&#150;930), his successors and probable students. Bishop Dido of Laon (<i>c</i>.882&#150;95) inherited one of Martin's books and might also have studied with the Laon master.<br>
