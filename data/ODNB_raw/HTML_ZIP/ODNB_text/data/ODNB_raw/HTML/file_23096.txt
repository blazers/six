<span class="headword">Ramsay,  Robert</span>  (1842&#150;1882), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Australia</span>, the eldest son of Andrew Mitchell Ramsay (1809&#150;1869), a minister of the United Presbyterian church, and his wife, Isabella Milne, was born at Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 16 February 1842. The family emigrated in 1847 to Melbourne (one of the three children died on the voyage), and Robert was educated at Robert Campbell's and John Macgregor's school in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, and then at Scotch College, Melbourne. He studied law at Melbourne University, graduating in 1861, and was admitted a solicitor in 1862. He began practice on his own account, but in January 1866 John Macgregor, jun., to whom he had been articled, took him into partnership in the firm of Macgregor, Ramsay, and Brahe of Melbourne. He married, on 16 April 1868, at Yangery, near Warrnambool, Isabella Catherine, the daughter of Roderick Urquhart of Yangery Park, Victoria.<br>
<br>Ramsay began his political career as secretary to a committee for abolishing state aid to religion, a cause to which his father devoted much of his life. From 1870 to 1882 he represented East Bourke in the legislative assembly, where state education initially absorbed his attention. He was a moderate protectionist, generally supporting Sir James McCulloch's ministry. In the frequent changes of Victorian ministries Ramsay served as minister without portfolio from 1872 to 1874, as postmaster-general from 1874 to 1877 (when, by introducing long terms of contract for the mail service, he saved the colony considerable sums of money), and as minister of public instruction from 1875 to 1877. In this last post he vigorously administered the <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, which he had introduced in 1872, and in two years opened more schools in country districts than any predecessor. He firmly believed in national education and ardently supported the separation of church and state. His tenure of office ended on 11 May 1877, but in 1878 he represented Victoria at the telegraphic conference in Sydney. On 5 March 1880 he joined James Service's ministry, where as chief secretary he was responsible for the controversial police actions which eventually led to the capture of Ned Kelly's gang, and, as minister for public instruction again, he tackled the problems of country schools and insisted on removing the name of Christ from school readers. After the government's defeat in August 1880, he left office, but continued active in parliamentary affairs until he died suddenly of pleurisy at his residence in Gipps Street, East Melbourne, on 23 May 1882. He was buried at Melbourne general cemetery, and was survived by his widow, two sons, and two daughters. He left an estate of about &pound;40,000, largely in pastoral properties. His main legacy to the colony was the firm establishment of secular education, the culmination of his and his father's campaign.<br>
