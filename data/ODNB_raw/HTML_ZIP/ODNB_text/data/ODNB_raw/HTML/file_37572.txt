<span class="headword">Hornung,  Ernest William</span>  (1866&#150;1921), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 7 June 1866 at Cleveland Villas, Marton, Middlesbrough, the eighth and last child of John Peter (formerly Johan Petrus) Hornung (1821&#150;1886) and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Armstrong (1824&#150;1896). His father, of Hungarian extraction, had transferred his trading skills to England in the mid-1840s and become a wealthy iron, coal, and timber merchant. Willie, as Hornung was known in the family circle, was small, thin, and short-sighted, and suffered from severe asthma. He was immensely fond of cricket, although his skills at the game were limited. He was educated at Uppingham School for four years, but poor health obliged him to leave in 1883. Sent to New South Wales, Australia, to recuperate, he was employed as a tutor but also worked on sheep farms and gained much useful knowledge and experience. He returned to England in 1886 to find his father bankrupt and dying.<br>
<br>Hornung lived for a time with his mother and sister in Twickenham, Middlesex. Abandoning hopes of being a poet, he nevertheless resolved to become a professional writer. With Australia as his favourite subject, he contributed articles and short stories to magazines and his first novel, <span class="italic">A Bride from the Bush</span>, was published in 1890. An assured, graceful comedy of manners, it was followed by seven novels with Australian settings and two collections of short stories. His books were well received and abounded in authentic Australian phraseology but freshness, adroitness of plot, and clarity of description came to be recognized as characteristic hallmarks of a Hornung novel.<br>
<br>Hornung lodged in west London, became acquainted with numerous authors and artists, and lived in close proximity to Oscar Wilde for a time. Although the extent of their acquaintance is difficult to gauge, he evidently felt a close affinity with the playwright and refers to him obliquely but unmistakably in several novels. Hornung married Constance Aim&eacute;e Monica Doyle (1868&#150;1924) on 27 September 1893 and thus became the brother-in-law of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32887/', "Arthur Conan Doyle (1859&#150;1930)")</script>. Their relations were sometimes strained, but Conan Doyle acted as godparent to Willie and Constance's only child&#151;Arthur Oscar Hornung (<i>b</i>. 24 March 1895)&#151;and accompanied them to Rome in 1898.<br>
<br>Hornung now started writing stories about A. J. Raffles&#151;former public schoolboy and varsity man, a cricketer by day and burglar by night. Published in 1899 as <span class="italic">The Amateur Cracksman</span> (impishly dedicated &#145;To A.C.D.&#146;), they attracted tremendous attention. Raffles is handsome, elegant, cynical, witty, and brave. He lives at The Albany, his debonair lifestyle, fondness for Sullivan cigarettes, and prowess at the wicket concealing nerves of steel. At times of crisis he copes daringly and ingeniously. His adventures are narrated by Bunny Manders, his admiring former fag and accomplice, and a homosexual relationship is hinted at. Ostensibly a collection of cautionary tales, it ends with Bunny in chains, facing eighteen months' imprisonment, and Raffles apparently drowned. But the miscreants enjoy a second innings in <span class="italic">The Black Mask</span> (1901), although Raffles has to masquerade as an elderly invalid for much of the time and can only venture out to a very limited extent. He is killed fighting for queen and country in the South African War, thereby atoning for his sins, but the tales were so immensely popular that a third collection, <span class="italic">A Thief in the Night</span>, relating some earlier adventures (and bringing the total number of short stories to twenty-six), was published in 1905. The first two collections were meanwhile merged into one volume (<span class="italic">Raffles: the Amateur Cracksman</span>) in 1906. Providing romance and excitement, and cocking a snook at authority, the books were massive best-sellers. Raffles would be portrayed on the stage by Gerald Du Maurier and on the screen by John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, and David Niven, and the stories would be a popular television series in the 1970s, but many people (including Conan Doyle) expressed grave doubt about Hornung's wisdom in writing them. In a sense, Raffles and Bunny were inverted counterparts of Holmes and Watson. But they were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas). To appreciate the clearest parallel drawn by Hornung between the man-about-town playwright who led a secret life and the man-about town cricketer who led a secret life, it must be explained that in 1820 Charles Maturin (Wilde's great-uncle) published a book called <span class="italic">Melmoth the Wanderer</span>. When Wilde went into hiding as a semi-invalid after coming out of prison in 1897&#151;fated, thereafter, to endure a shadowy existence&#151;he called himself Sebastian Melmoth. When Raffles went into hiding as a semi-invalid after coming back to England in 1897&#151;fated, thereafter, to endure a shadowy existence&#151;he called himself Mr Maturin. Both Wilde and Raffles would die in 1900.<br>
<br>Between 1899 and 1914 Hornung wrote <span class="italic">Peccavi</span> (1900), an absorbing account of a disgraced clergyman's atonement, and several thrillers of varying quality&#151;among them <span class="italic">Mr Justice Raffles</span> (1909), which proved a disappointment for the fans of the cracksman. He also created an Oxford-educated bushranger called Stingaree. Most of his later works showed a sad decline in quality, although <span class="italic">Fathers of Men</span> (1912), narrating the career of a former stable boy at a fictionalized Uppingham, was regarded by many critics as a fine achievement. <span class="italic">Witching Hill</span> (1913), about strange happenings on a new housing estate, endeavoured to break fresh ground but went almost unnoticed. Its two successors were feeble productions, bringing his novel-writing career to a lacklustre conclusion.<br>
<br>Short, dark-haired, and dapper, Hornung grew a moustache in the 1890s and invariably wore large pebble glasses. He was a quiet man averse to public life, although active in the Society of Authors and a frequent speaker at his old preparatory school. A firm believer in the merits of discipline, his two greatest enthusiasms were cricket and the public school system. He warmly endorsed Sir Henry Newbolt's sentiments of &#145;Play up, play up, and play the game!&#146; Cricket loomed large in his stories, and he was proud of his election to the MCC (1907); he also enjoyed lawn tennis and cycling and (later) motoring and skating. An amusing conversationalist, he joined the Reform Club in the mid-1890s and remained a member until elected to the Savile Club in 1913.<br>
<br>Hornung and his wife lived in Kensington, London, for most of their married life. They took a great interest in the education of their son, Oscar, about to enter Cambridge when war broke out in August 1914, and were stunned by his death in action in July 1915. Hornung produced a little biography of him for private circulation, joined an anti-aircraft unit, and started doing voluntary YMCA work for troops home on leave. He visited the western front and his poem about a military cemetery, &#145;Wooden Crosses&#146;, was published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and subsequently as a tiny booklet in its own right. Anxious to play a more active role, he went to France for the YMCA and by Christmas 1917 was serving behind the counter in a front-line canteen in Arras. He established a lending library for the troops but in March 1918, following substantial German advances, all civilians were sent home. He wrote an account of his experiences and re-established his library in Cologne after the armistice. Returning to England in 1919, he settled down with Constance at Midway Cottage, Partridge Green, a quiet Sussex hamlet in close proximity to his brother Pitt and his family at West Grinstead. He published a slim volume of collected verse and began work on a new novel, convinced it would be the best that he had yet written.<br>
<br>Held in much affection by friends and relatives, Hornung was a kind, sensitive, and conscientious man, endowed with a keen sense of humour. A fictionalized version of himself in <span class="italic">Fathers of Men</span>, &#145;a wild impulse burning in his eyes&#146;  (Hornung, <span class="italic">Fathers of Men</span>, 344), declares that he has not always been so &#145;straight&#146; as generally supposed, but stops short of saying more. Clearly, Hornung was <i>not</i> a sphinx without a secret. But, equally clearly, sentiments expressed by a character in <span class="italic">The Camera Fiend</span> (1911) are his own&#151;&#145;I like a man's secrets to die with him&#146;  (Hornung, <span class="italic">Camera Fiend</span>, 268). Accompanying Constance to the south of France, he caught a chill which turned into aggravated influenza and pneumonia. He died on 22 March 1921 at St Jean de Luz and was buried in its cemetery a few feet away from his friend George Gissing.<br>
