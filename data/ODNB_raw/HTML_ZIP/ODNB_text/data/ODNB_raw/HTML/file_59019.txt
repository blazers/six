<span class="headword">Stapleton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dolman]</span>,  Mary Helen Alicia</span>  (1837&#150;1918), <span class="occ">local historian</span>, was born on 14 August 1837 at Eaton Bishop, Herefordshire, the only daughter of John Thomas Dolman (<i>d</i>. 1868), a physician in York, and his wife, Ann Helen Cox; both her parents belonged to long-established Roman Catholic families. She attended the Bar Convent School, York. In the mid-1840s the Dolmans moved to Souldern Manor in Oxfordshire, which belonged to Mrs Dolman's father. On 24 June 1857 Mary Dolman married Bryan John Stapleton (1831&#150;1903), sixth son of Thomas Stapleton (1788&#150;1839), of Carlton House, Yorkshire, and half-brother of the eighth Lord Beaumont; the couple lived initially at The Grove, Richmond, Yorkshire, where their first three children were born. They were to have seven sons and seven daughters; three of the children died in infancy. The marriage was a happy one, despite the contrasting temperaments of husband and wife: while Bryan John was full of &#145;fiery impetuosity&#146;, Mary was described by her daughter Winifred as &#145;quiet and undemonstrative&#146; and &#145;English to the core&#146;  (Stapleton, 67).<br>
<br>In 1868, after Mary's father died, the Stapletons moved to Souldern Manor. The household was happy and carefree, though the children received a strict religious education of the traditional English Catholic variety, which produced devout but reticent &#145;Garden of the Soul Catholics&#146;  (Stapleton, 28). Although a devoted and busy mother, Mary Stapleton found time to play Lady Bountiful in the local village and to form a friendship with Bishop Ullathorne of Birmingham. In the late 1870s the Stapletons lost some property in Yorkshire and one daughter died of diphtheria; their straitened finances and concerns about the unhealthiness of Souldern caused them to move to Grove House, Kidlington. They later lived at different addresses in Oxford, including The Cedars, Summertown, and became more involved in city life and local Conservative politics.<br>
<br>Both Mary Stapleton and her husband developed an interest in local history: a member of the North Oxfordshire Archaeological Society (later the Oxfordshire Archaeological Society) from 1881, Bryan John Stapleton was a committee member and treasurer from <i>c</i>.1897 until his death, after which Mrs Stapleton became a life member. She probably turned more fully to &#145;her favourite occupation, the writing of local history&#146;  (Stapleton, 65) after the birth of her last child in 1884, although she had been collecting information while still at Kidlington. Her researches in Oxfordshire libraries, local houses, and churchyards were initially for &#145;pleasure and private use&#146;  (Stapleton, 65), but an Oxford don persuaded her to let Oxford University Press publish her work. Her first publication was <span class="italic">Three Oxfordshire Parishes: a History of Kidlington, Yarnton, and Begbroke</span> (1893). A more substantial work&#151;reflecting her religious affiliation&#151;followed in 1906: <span class="italic">A history of the Post-Reformation Catholic missions in Oxfordshire, with an account of the families connected to them</span> contained more relating to the second half of its title than its first, and her own annotated copy, now in the Bodleian Library, contains interpolated hand-drawn family trees. The book was based on exhaustive research in a wide range of printed sources and manuscripts in Oxford colleges and the Bodleian. Winifred Stapleton recalled that her father was &#145;very proud of mother's wonderful talents and delighted to call her the &#147;walking encyclopaedia&#148;&#146;  (Stapleton, 65&#150;6). Despite this promising (if dull) beginning, Mrs Stapleton contributed little more to the early twentieth-century resurgence in Catholic history; however, she did supply historical notes to several Oxfordshire Catholic registers in the 1911 and 1915 volumes published by the Catholic Record Society.<br>
<br>Bryan John Stapleton died in March 1903; Mary Stapleton was doubly bereaved, as two of their sons had lately been killed in the South African War. Later that year Mary and her youngest daughter went on the tour of northern Italy, and to Rome for an audience with the pope. She then moved to 78 Parkwood Road, Boscombe, Hampshire, where she lived for the rest of her life. She died there, surrounded by candles representing her fourteen children, on 10 April 1918, and was buried on 15 April in Boscombe cemetery. Although an obituarist opined that &#145;she will be chiefly remembered as one of the early band of lady historians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxfordshire Archaeological Society Report</span>, 2), she was one of many amateur women historians who for decades had turned to the materials closest to hand, thus becoming contributors to the development of minor historical disciplines such as family and local history.<br>
