<span class="headword">Watt,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1819), <span class="occ">physician and bibliographer</span>, was baptized on 1 May 1774 in Stewarton parish church, Stewarton, Ayrshire, the youngest of the three sons of John Watt, farmer, of Bonnyton, Ayrshire, and his wife, Jean Calderwood. Watt's early years were spent on his father's small farm. At the age of six he was sent to the local parish school, where he was an able pupil whose intellectual abilities aroused the jealousy of his contemporaries. He remained at this school until he was twelve, when he became a jobbing ploughman around the neighbourhood of his father's farm. While still in his teens he travelled to Dumfriesshire as a member of a road mending gang. While there he spent some time at Ellisland, the farm of the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Burns allowed Watt to borrow from his library, and this intellectual contact and encouragement appear to have whetted Watt's appetite for learning.<br>
<br>In 1791, at the age of seventeen, Watt was apprenticed to his brother as a cabinet-maker. During his apprenticeship Watt had a chance meeting with a Glasgow University student and from him &#145;I received marvellous accounts of what mighty things were to be learned, what wonders to be seen, about a University; and I imbibed an unquenchable desire to follow his course&#146;  (Finlayson, 8). The following year he began to receive tuition in Latin and Greek from Duncan MacFarlane, schoolmaster in Stewarton. In 1793 Watt matriculated at Glasgow University, and in that session won a prize for Greek. In session 1794&#150;5 he studied Greek and logic. The following session his subjects were moral and natural philosophy. In the summer of 1795 he taught in a private school in Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, following which he enrolled at Edinburgh University as a student of anatomy and divinity. He was again a prizewinner at Edinburgh, earning &pound;10 for his essay &#145;Regeneration&#146;, of which Professor Andrew Hunter, professor of divinity at Edinburgh University from 1779 to 1809, remarked &#145;that it was not only the best essay, but the first time, under him, that a student of the first year's standing attempted so well and so deservedly&#146;  (Finlayson, 10). Watt returned to Ayrshire in 1797 and was the master of the parochial school at Symington until 1798. During that session he was enrolled again as a divinity student at Edinburgh University, winning a prize of &pound;8 for an essay on prayer. He subsequently withdrew from his divinity studies and completed his education with a course in medicine at Glasgow University in 1798&#150;9.<br>
<br>Having acquired the licence of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1799 Watt set up practice as a general practitioner in Paisley. On 14 September 1800 he married Marion Burns (<i>d</i>. 1856); they had nine children. In 1802 he entered partnership with John Muir, who had been a fellow student in Edinburgh. Watt published a number of articles on medical subjects during his time in Paisley. His main contribution to the medical profession during this period, however, was as one of the founder members of the Paisley Medical Society, which held its first meeting on 19 September 1806. On 5 January 1807 he was elected a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, thereby entering the local medical &eacute;lite. His medical status was raised further when he gained the MD of King's College, Aberdeen, in 1810. Thereafter he set himself up in practice as a physician in Glasgow, and he also lectured on medicine. As an adjunct to his medical lectures he established a library of some thousand books which he made available to his students. He published a catalogue of the library in 1812, which was prefaced by &#145;An address to medical students on the best means of prosecuting their studies&#146;. The catalogue also notes that the library contained about a thousand theses not listed there.<br>
<br>Watt was active in medical and intellectual circles in the period 1810&#150;17. His enhanced status as a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow enabled him to hold office in that body, and he was president from 1814 to 1816. In 1814 he was a founder member of the Glasgow Medical Society and its first president. That same year he was elected physician to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, holding the post until 1817. In 1816 he became president of the Glasgow Philosophical Society.<br>
<br>In 1813 Watt published a treatise on whooping cough, in which he included an epidemiological study comparing the number of deaths among children under ten in Glasgow before and after the introduction of smallpox vaccination. This was an important early study which concluded that deaths from smallpox had fallen steeply since the introduction of vaccination, but that the total number of deaths of children remained the same, measles and other diseases accounting for the deaths of vaccinated children who had not contracted smallpox.<br>
<br>Watt gave up practice in 1817 through a combination of ill health and a desire to see published a work he had been undertaking since about 1799. This work was his massive bibliography, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Britannica</span>, the aim of which was to list by author and subject the works of all authors from Britain, or the British dominions at the time. He also included what he termed &#145;a copious selection from the writings of the most distinguished authors of all ages and nations&#146;  (Goodall and Gibson, 45). He retired to Campvale, then a village to the south of Glasgow, later part of the city, where, assisted by his sons, the poet William Motherwell, and Alexander Whitelaw, he began to bring the work to fruition. <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Britannica</span> was initially published in nine parts, parts 1&#150;4 appearing from 1819 to 1820 in Glasgow, and parts 5&#150;9 appearing between 1821 and 1824 in Edinburgh. A four volume printing of the work by Constable appeared in Edinburgh in 1824. The first two volumes consist of an alphabetical author index, in which each author's work is arranged chronologically. Volumes 3 and 4 are a subject index, again with each work arranged chronologically. Each author entry has an alphanumeric mark, which is used in the subject index, to refer the reader from the subject entry for the book to the bibliographically more complete author entry. Watt also indexed a number of leading periodicals, increasing the value of the work as a bibliographical tool. Its value is further enhanced by biographical notes on many of the authors.<br>
<br>Watt saw only the first few sheets of his <i>magnum opus</i> off the press. He died on 12 March 1819, and was buried in Glasgow Cathedral churchyard. The burial register states the cause of his death as consumption. Watt's widow received no money for the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca</span>, as the publisher went bankrupt shortly after the work was published.<br>
