<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boorde,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1490&#150;1549), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was born at Borde Hill near Cuckfield, Sussex. Like many others in the field of healing he began his career as a monk. He was brought up at Oxford and admitted under age, in 1515, into the Carthusian order at the London Charterhouse. His precocity within the order was rewarded while he was still in his twenties by nomination as suffragan bishop of Chichester. In 1517, however, he was accused of being &#145;conversant with women&#146;, and was dismissed from his post by papal bull in 1521 before he could exercise any of its prerogatives. Uncomfortable with the abstemious, vegetarian lifestyle of the cloistered Carthusians, Boorde wrote in 1528 to John Batmanson, then prior of Hinton Charterhouse in Somerset, asking for release from his vows. Although some technical difficulties remained, Boorde received his dispensation and went abroad to study medicine at as many universities as he could. He returned to England in 1530 and, while staying with Sir Robert Drewry, ministered to Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk. Boorde recorded that at Norfolk's request he attended Henry VIII, but no report of payment is recorded in the king's privy purse expenses.<br>
<br>Boorde was travelling again in 1532, conferring with medical men in Orl&eacute;ans, Poitiers, Toulouse, Wittenberg, and Rome. He also made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia and met surgeons at the university there. Back in England, on 29 May 1534, Boorde took the oath of conformity, perhaps influenced by a brief confinement in the London Charterhouse. Upon his release he spent some time with Thomas Cromwell in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Recognizing Boorde's usefulness as an itinerant physician Cromwell sent him abroad in 1535 to test continental opinion of the divorced king. Boorde travelled extensively through France, Spain, and Portugal. He corresponded with Cromwell on 20 June 1535 from Bordeaux, where he bemoaned England's lack of sympathetic allies in Europe excepting the French. Later that summer Boorde sent rhubarb seeds from Barbary to Cromwell with directions for their cultivation, noting that the plant was greatly prized in Spain  (Boorde, <span class="italic">Introduction and Dyetary</span>, 56). Boorde's journey in 1535 was the most extensive he had yet undertaken, and he described it in <span class="italic">The Itinerary of Europe</span>, a diary describing each region, which he lent to Cromwell. Cromwell evidently lost the volume, but part of it may have been re-worked into <span class="italic">The Peregrination or Itinerary of England</span>, printed in 1735  (ibid., 23&#150;4). <span class="italic">Peregrination</span> lists market towns, castles in England and Wales, and adjacent islands for the armchair traveller, and includes information on bridges, rivers, and highways into the shires from London.<br>
<br>By April 1536 Boorde was practising medicine in Glasgow, still writing regularly to Cromwell with information about the Scots, whom he did not like and who, he reported, did not like the English. After a year's residence in Scotland, Boorde was again briefly in England in 1537, spending some time in Yorkshire, Cambridge, and London, where he oversaw production of his <span class="italic">Almanake and Pronostication for 1537</span>. He experienced some trouble in the capital, and wrote to Cromwell asking for help in recovering horses stolen from him and sizeable debts owed him by individuals who called him &#145;appostata&#146;, and &#145;all-to-nowght&#146; (good-for-nothing). Late in 1537, or after the dissolution of the religious houses in early 1538, Boorde left for Jerusalem to see the holy sepulchre, travelling for several years on a journey of remarkable range that took him east via Venice and back to the west through Naples and Rome. In 1540 a little treatise usually associated with Boorde, <span class="italic">Book for to Lerne a Man to by Wyse in Buyldyng his Howse for the Helth of his Body</span>, appeared anonymously in London. For a while Boorde settled in Montpellier, site of his favourite university, purportedly accumulating amusing stories that were ascribed to him and later published as <span class="italic">Scogin's Jests</span>, &#145;a preservative against melancholy&#146;  (John Scogin, <span class="italic">Scogin's Jests</span>, 1680). This comedic book and <span class="italic">Merry Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham</span>, traditionally attributed to Boorde, have led to the popular notion that he was the original Merry Andrew. In Montpellier in 1542 he wrote his <span class="italic">Pryncyples of Astronamye</span> and completed <span class="italic">The Compendious Regiment, or, Dyetary of Helth</span>, dedicated to Norfolk, which included the earlier <span class="italic">Book for to Lerne</span>. That same year he penned <span class="italic">The First Book of the Introduction of Knowledge</span>. Intended as a medical treatise, the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> was illustrated with woodcuts and records Boorde's good-natured observations made on a lengthy clockwise tour of Europe beginning at Calais. Using rhyme, dialect, and other amusing techniques Boorde provided delightful details about the fashions, foods, costumes, weather, and business of dozens of continental regions from Norway to Greece. Dedicated to the Princess Mary, the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> contained numbers, monetary information, and key foreign phrases including the first printed specimen of the Romani language. Boorde's lost <span class="italic">Boke of Berdes</span> appeared at about the same time, and satirist Milton Barnes, through whose work we can detect Boorde's, retorted that Boorde blamed his own drunken stench on his facial hair  (Barnes, <span class="italic">Treatyse Answering the Book of Berdes</span>, 1543). Boorde's <span class="italic">A Breviary of Health</span>, a self-help book of remedies and preventives gleaned from his travels, followed in 1547. Written in a popular and confident style, the <span class="italic">Breviary</span> suggests oil of radish for ringing in the ears, green ginger for indigestion, and garlic for worms. Boorde returned to England later in 1547 to guide the <span class="italic">Dyetary</span>, the <span class="italic">Breviary</span>, and the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> through publication. It is likely that he lived for a while in the house of the master of the hospital of St Giles-in-the-Fields. Barnes acknowledged, however grudgingly, that Boorde had many patients in London.<br>
<br>Boorde took up residence in Winchester. Charged by John Ponet, later bishop of Winchester, with keeping three prostitutes in his chamber Boorde was put in Fleet prison in 1547; his old patrons dead or powerless, Boorde did not leave prison alive. His will was drawn up in the Fleet on 9 April 1549 and was proved on 25 April. He left two houses in Lynn given to him by Recorder Conysby; tenements in Pevensey, Sussex, that he had inherited from his brother; and diverse properties in and around Winchester. No record exists about his burial.<br>
