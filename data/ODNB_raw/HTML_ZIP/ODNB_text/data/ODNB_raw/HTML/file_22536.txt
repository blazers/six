<span class="headword">Pope,  Walter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1628, <em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">astronomer and writer</span>, was baptized at All Saints', Oxford, on 30 November 1628, the son of Francis Pope (<i>d</i>. 1631), officiating minister at All Saints', and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1635), daughter of the puritan preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7729/', "John Dod (1550&#150;1645)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29421/', "John Wilkins")</script> (afterwards bishop of Chester) was his half-brother from his mother's previous marriage. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1645. He was appointed scholar of Wadham College, where Wilkins was warden, by the parliamentary visitors in October 1648; he graduated BA on 6 July 1649, was admitted to a fellowship on 9 July 1651, and graduated MA on the following day. He held various offices in his college, including that of sub-warden in 1658, and, as junior proctor of the university, successfully resisted in 1658 an attempt to abolish the wearing of caps and hoods. Later in the same year he went abroad, and in September 1659 wrote to Robert Boyle from Paris that he spent his time reading Corneille's plays and romances, &#145;which we hire like horses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Boyle</span>, 5.631). He was elected dean of Wadham College for 1660&#150;61, had the degree of DM conferred upon him at Oxford on 12 September 1661, and succeeded Christopher Wren as professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, in June 1662.<br>
<br>Pope obtained licence to travel in 1664 and spent two years in Italy, while Isaac Barrow and Robert Hooke took his lectures. He had a reputation for wit as well as for learning; he acquired French and Italian abroad and taught them to Wilkins, and he could also converse in Spanish. He was among the first members of the Royal Society, being admitted on 22 May 1661; he sat on the council in 1667 and 1669. Wilkins made him registrar of the diocese on his elevation to the see of Chester in 1668, and Pope held the post until his death.<br>
<br>At Salisbury in 1686 Pope suffered severely from an inflammation of the eyes, but was eventually cured by Dr Daubeney Turberville, whose epitaph he gratefully wrote. It was probably this infirmity which induced him on 21 September 1687 to resign his professorship and withdraw to Epsom, Surrey. On 16 November 1693 he lost all his books through a fire in Lombard Street. He was also annoyed by a protracted lawsuit. Wood, who was very bitter towards him, accused him of having led &#145;a heathenish and epicurean life&#146;, but John Ward regarded Pope's intimacy with Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, as alone sufficient to refute the charge  (Ward, 111&#150;16).<br>
<br>Pope often stayed in Ward's house, received from him a pension of &pound;100 a year, and endeavoured to console the bishop and divert his melancholy in his last years. Most of Pope's publications consisted of poetry and translations. Of his letters to the Royal Society on natural history subjects arising from his travels, only two were published in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>&#151;one in 1665 on the mercury mines of Friuli, and one in 1666 on a solar eclipse seen in London. Pope's later years were passed at Bunhill Fields, London, where he died in 1714. A few days before his death he executed a deed of gift to Anne Shargold, who had cared for him for many years. She was to receive all his possessions and remaining money, the purpose of the deed being to prevent his relations disputing her rights. He was buried in St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 25 June.<br>
