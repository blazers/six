<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Neilans,  Alison Roberta Noble</span>  (1884&#150;1942), <span class="occ">suffragist and social reformer</span>, was born at Ellesmere, Friern Road, East Dulwich, Surrey, on 19 June 1884, the only daughter of Robert Neilans (1843&#150;<i>c</i>.1896), a commercial traveller, and his wife, Alison Ferguson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Noble (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1842). Her parents were from Coldstream-on-Tweed in the Scottish borders, where her grandparents had been farmers. She was educated at a private school in Dulwich until the age of twelve, when the death of her father dealt an emotional and economic blow that saw her education and her home life, according to a friend, &#145;come to an abrupt end&#146;  (Acres, 12). From her early teenage years she was forced to be financially independent and lived in lodgings and women's hostels in London while working as a book-keeper. She never married.<br>
<br>In 1908 Neilans joined the Women's Freedom League as its financial secretary, and settled into employment in political campaigning which, though it never kept her far from poverty, became her lifelong career. She gained notoriety as a &#145;militant&#146; when she was twice arrested in 1908: first, in January 1908, during a protest outside the London home of Lewis Harcourt, a cabinet minister; and then in October 1908 during a demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament. On both occasions she was imprisoned for one month after refusing to pay a fine. During the Bermondsey by-election of November 1909 she took part in an attempt to spoil ballot papers, in protest at the withholding of the vote from women, but the ammonia used for the purpose accidentally caused an eye injury to an electoral official. Imprisoned for three months, she went on hunger strike and was force-fed. Over the next few years she continued to organize on behalf of the Women's Freedom League, as well as the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society (her parents were Catholics though she seems not to have maintained strong denominational ties) and Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes.<br>
<br>By 1912 she had begun to develop an interest in an issue that would become her lifelong cause: prostitution. She joined the British branch of the International Abolitionist Federation, founded by Josephine Butler, James Stuart, and others who had campaigned for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and who opposed state-regulated prostitution. When the British branch merged with the Ladies' National Association (another Butler-led organization) to form the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene in 1915 Neilans became its secretary with the support of Helen Wilson, the president, and soon afterwards took over the editorship of its journal, <span class="italic">The Shield</span>.<br>
<br>During the First World War Neilans fought attempts to introduce compulsory testing and treatment of venereal disease, and campaigned against military brothels in France and regulated prostitution more generally on the continent and in the empire. She also protested against the efforts of the National Vigilance Association and other social purity advocates to pass bills allowing for the extended incarceration of girls under eighteen who had been convicted of prostitution-related offences. She also oversaw a significant private enquiry in 1918 that examined laws against street prostitution and venereal disease legislation, and published its recommendations in 1920.<br>
<br>Neilans was particularly involved in the campaign of the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene for the repeal of Britain's laws against street prostitution. &#145;The solicitation laws&#146;, as they came to be called, were founded on the idea that a common prostitute was a legally definable person, and that, while prostitution itself was not an offence, the action of street solicitation represented a special kind of public nuisance. She condemned these laws as unjust, unequal between men and women, and as stigmatizing the women who came under their power. She wrote in 1917:<blockquote>Justice is higher than mere morality, and the test of our justice is the way we treat those who are held to be of little esteem. The solicitation laws can only be carried out by riding carelessly over the principles of law. They depend upon lack of proper definition, lack of proper evidence, and their foundation is the double standard of morality. (<span class="italic">The Shield</span>, 1917, 415)</blockquote>She also criticized the way in which the police enforced these laws, and urged women's participation in the police force and other criminal justice professions.Neilans's beliefs and policies on prostitution-related issues were marked by her firm commitment to the principles of individual liberty, justice, sexual equality, and &#145;personal responsibility&#146;. Her defence of libertarian feminism and the individual rights of prostitutes regardless of their occupation sometimes put her at odds with other campaigners, who placed more importance on the immorality of prostitution or on the reform of prostitute women. She wrote pointedly in 1922:<blockquote>The prostitute is the scapegoat for everyone's sins, and few people really care whether she is justly treated or not. Good people have spent thousands of pounds in efforts to reform her, poets have written about her, essayists and orators have made her the subject of some of their most striking rhetoric; perhaps no class of people has been so much abused, persecuted, hated, or, alternatively, sentimentalized over as prostitutes have been, but one thing they have never had yet, and that is simple legal justice. (<span class="italic">The Shield</span>, 1922, 402)</blockquote>Neilans succeeded in mobilizing a wide range of feminist organizations: the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, the National Council of Women, and the National Association of Women Teachers all tabled resolutions backing the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene's struggle against the unjust treatment of prostitutes, while the St Joan's Social and Political Alliance, the International Women's League, the Six Point Group, the Women's Freedom League, the Open Door Council, the Salvation Army, and the Young Women's Christian Association among others all lent their support to many of her campaigns. With the help of Nancy Astor and several supportive male MPs, she oversaw the introduction of several bills into parliament to repeal the existing solicitation laws and replace them with a general regulation that sought to prevent annoyances by any person on the street. She testified to several government commissions as an expert on prostitution, including the street offences committee, appointed in 1928, which proposed to do away with the term &#145;common prostitute&#146; (though its recommendations did not pass into law).<br>
<br>Neilans supported other feminist causes, protesting against protective legislation that restricted the occupations open to working women, for instance, and advocating unemployment insurance for women. Unlike many of her feminist and social worker contemporaries, she argued against such eugenic principles as voluntary sterilization. Her role as the author of &#145;Changes in sexual morality&#146; in Ray Strachey's volume <span class="italic">Our Freedom and its Results</span> (1936), which reflected upon the status of women in the years after gaining the suffrage, is testimony to her important place in inter-war feminism in Britain.<br>
<br>Neilans also took part in international networks to oppose state-regulated prostitution and prevent the trafficking of women and children. She regularly attended International Abolitionist Federation conferences as a British representative and served on the advisory committee for social questions of the League of Nations. She held the chair of committees relating to prostitution at the International Council of Women and the International Alliance for Equal Citizenship. A gifted public speaker, she travelled widely on lecture tours in the Middle East and continental Europe, and corresponded with feminists and prostitution experts in India, the Far East, and the United States. She was particularly well remembered in the press for having organized a women's rally at the sultan's palace in Istanbul.<br>
<br>Many of Neilans's contemporaries considered her to be the Josephine Butler of her generation. She organized the celebrations in 1936 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, reaffirming Butler's challenge to the &#145;double standard&#146; in sexual matters. Neilans feared, however, that the principle of &#145;personal liberty with personal responsibility&#146; was under renewed threat with the spread of militarism, and the attendant trend to reintroduce regulated prostitution  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 April 1936). Her twenty-five years of work for the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene was marked by a dinner in November 1938 attended by William Temple, archbishop of York, Lady Astor, and Maude Royden.<br>
<br>Just after the outbreak of the Second World War Neilans suffered from a rare and rapidly progressing illness described only as a &#145;paralysis disorder&#146;, and over two years gradually lost the use of her limbs and eventually her power of speech. She died on 17 July 1942 at her home, 34 Asmuns Place, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 21 July. A memorial service at St Martin-in-the-Fields was held on 25 September. &#145;Human individual freedom was safe so long as she lived&#146;, a friend and admirer reflected, &#145;because she knew with perfect clearness how to assert it and maintain it&#146;  (supplement to <span class="italic">The Shield</span>, April 1943, 5).<br>
