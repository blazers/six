<span class="headword">Auden,  John Bicknell</span>  (1903&#150;1991), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 14 December 1903 at 54 Bootham, York, the second of three sons of George Augustus Auden (1872&#150;1957), a medical doctor, and his wife, Constance Rosalie, formerly Bicknell (1869&#150;1941). The poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30775/', "Wystan Hugh Auden (1907&#150;1973)")</script> was his younger brother. John Auden was devoted to his maternal Bicknell aunts, whom he felt gave him more love than did his parents; their favourite was apparently Wystan, &#145;the spoilt third son&#146;  (Davenport-Hines, 13). The family moved to Birmingham where his father became professor of public health and in September 1915 John was sent, together with Wystan, to preparatory school at St Edmund's, Hindhead, Surrey, where he gained prizes for French, English and classics and, already wearing spectacles, was nicknamed Dodo. He was at Marlborough College from 1917 to 1922 and read geology at his father's college, Christ's, Cambridge, from 1923, gaining firsts in parts one and two of the natural sciences tripos and graduating BA 1926, MA 1930, ScD 1948.<br>
<br>As a young man John wrote poetry: his &#145;La Ciamarella&#146; was published in <span class="italic">Christ's College Magazine</span> (1926). Described by Cecil Day Lewis as &#145;an extreme neurotic&#146;  (Davenport-Hines, 12) in the early 1930s, he suffered from depression. From 1926 to 1935 he served in the Indian geological survey, working for ten years on the Vidhyan formations of the Himalayas, and he subsequently became head of the survey. He was a keen mountaineer and founder member of the Himalayan Club in 1927; in the 1930s he explored the higher ranges of the Karakoram and Anghil and the glaciers of K2, most notably on Eric Shipton's 1937 expedition. He visited Wystan in Berlin in 1929 and his talk of the then unconquered K2 gave Wystan the idea for the play he wrote with Isherwood, <span class="italic">The Ascent of F6</span>, which he dedicated to John. Wystan also turned to a geological theme in some of his poetry.<br>
<br>In 1937 John learned to fly and he explored by air the unmapped areas of the Bijaigarh shales. In 1940 he was elected president of the Presidency College, Calcutta. Between 1945 and 1951 he investigated almost all the Indian major dam sites, hydroelectric projects, irrigation works, and water supply schemes. His groundwater studies of western Rajasthan, Cutch, and Quetta were considered a landmark in Indian engineering geology. He was awarded the gold medal of the Asiatic Society in 1953 and the Da Wadia medal of the Indian National Science Academy in 1980.<br>
<br>Through Wystan, John met Margaret Marshall, who was about seven years older than Wystan and wife of her second husband, Douglas Marshall. She was interested in psychology and apparently a follower of Emil Cou&eacute;. Wystan described her as &#145;one of those pleasant pornographic women&#146;  (Davenport-Hines, 70); according to Day Lewis &#145;she had no tabus&#146;  (ibid., 72). While on leave, John consulted her about his depression. She treated him and tried to persuade him not to return to India. Following her husband's early death, she and John married in 1930 and went to India. The marriage was disastrous. She was a domineering woman, her spending offended John, and she was unfaithful to him. Following &#145;bitterness and despair in Calcutta&#146;  (ibid., 72) they separated in January 1932 and were divorced in October 1933.<br>
<br>In 1940 John married Sheila Bonnerjee, daughter of an English-educated barrister and granddaughter of Woomesh Chunder Bonnerjee (1844&#150;1906), a founder and first president of the Indian National Congress. They had two daughters, Anita and Rita. Wystan visited John in Calcutta in 1951 and then and later discussed partition with him; presumably their discussions influenced his poem &#145;Partition&#146; (1966). Wystan was very fond of John's daughters, generously assisted them when they were Oxford undergraduates, and made them his residuary legatees.<br>
<br>John had been brought up as an Anglo-Catholic, and in 1951 he converted to Roman Catholicism. After his retirement from the Indian survey he joined the Sudan geological survey from 1953 to 1955, and worked from 1956 to 1960 as a research geologist for the Burmah Oil Company. He then moved to Rome, working until 1968 for the land and water sources division of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). He was a consultant for UNESCO from 1968 to 1969 and in 1975. In retirement he lived at 43 Thurloe Square, South Kensington, close to the Geological Museum, and he served as vice-president of the Geological Society of London, where he was sharply sceptical of the new geological orthodoxy of plate tectonics. He arranged for Wystan's ecumenical funeral at Kirchstetten and contributed &#145;A brother's viewpoint&#146; to <span class="italic">W. H. Auden: a Tribute</span> (1975), edited by Stephen Spender, defending Wystan's controversial decision to desert England for the United States in 1939 when war was imminent. John died at his home on 21 January 1991, survived by his wife and children.<br>
