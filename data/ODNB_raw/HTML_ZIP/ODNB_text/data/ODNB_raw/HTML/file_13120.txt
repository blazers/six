<span class="headword">Hervey <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Hervie]</span>,  Thomas Kibble</span>  (1799&#150;1859), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, was born at Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 11 February 1799, one of the sons of James Hervie, a drysalter who settled in Manchester in 1803, and his wife, Isobella Kibble. He was baptized in the parish of Abbey on 26 February 1799. After attending Manchester grammar school he was articled to Sharp, Eccles &amp; Co., a firm of solicitors in Manchester, and subsequently to another firm in London. He then read law in the chambers of a well-known barrister, Mr (later Sergeant) Scriven and, from 1818 to 1820, at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he left without taking a degree. His best-known literary production, a long poem in two parts entitled <span class="italic">Australia</span>, was published during his second year at Trinity. Much admired both there and in London, where it appeared in new editions, along with some of his shorter poems, in 1824, 1825, and 1829, <span class="italic">Australia</span> reads as if written for an undergraduate prize, as it in fact was; Hervey's ideas about Australia and its neighbouring islands, largely drawn from newspapers and from a few books which are cited in pseudo-scholarly notes, are fanciful in the extreme. His reputation was enhanced by lyrics such as &#145;The Convict Ship&#146;, &#145;Floranthe&#146;, and the four <span class="italic">Illustrations of Modern Sculpture</span> (1832); some of these continued to find their way into anthologies until the mid-Victorian period. A longer poem, <span class="italic">The Devil's Progress</span>, was published in 1830. He edited and contributed to two fashionable literary annuals, <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span> in 1826 and 1827, and <span class="italic">The Amaranth</span> in 1839. On 17 October 1843 he married Eleanora Louisa Montagu (<i>b</i>. 1811?), the daughter of George Conway Montagu of Lackham, Wiltshire. The couple had a son, Frederick Robert James.<br>
<br>From 1831 to 1853 nearly all of Hervey's literary energy appears to have been devoted to reviews and other articles in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, ranking in the number of his contributions with the prolific H. F. Chorley and Hepworth Dixon. The subjects of his reviews included Browning, Tennyson, Dickens, and French literature. His obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (April 1859, 433) conceded that as a reviewer he was &#145;characterized by a causticity of censure and a costiveness of praise, scarcely worthy of a journal of high standing&#146;. He nevertheless became editor of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, in succession to C. W. Dilke, on 23 May 1846. Under his editorship the paper departed from its previous policy by championing humanitarian causes, among them prison reform, one of Hervey's own interests. Its sales apparently increased, at least during his last three years as editor, but the quality of its reviews deteriorated  (Marchand, 76&#150;81). The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> considered that his &#145;acknowledged qualifications&#146; for the editorship were counterbalanced by his &#145;desultory and procrastinating habits&#146;; these it attributed to the chronic asthma from which he had suffered for many years and which led to his resignation in the autumn of 1853  (p. 432).<br>
<br>In the remaining five years of his life Hervey contributed frequently to the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. Together with a single article in the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span> (December 1836), a few brief tales in the annuals, and his contributions to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, these appear to comprise virtually the whole corpus of his published writings in prose. He died at 8 Ponsford Terrace, Haverstock Hill, London, on 17 February 1859, from asthma and bronchitis. He was survived by his wife, and was buried at Highgate cemetery, Middlesex.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Hervey was preparing a collected edition of his poems. This was completed by his widow and published in 1866 as <span class="italic">The Poems of T. K. Hervey</span>, with an introductory memoir. Before her marriage to Hervey she had been an established poet in her own right, having produced a long poem, <span class="italic">Edith of Graystock</span> (1833), a five-act play in verse, <span class="italic">The Landgrave</span> (1839), and a number of short poems, some of which had appeared in the annuals edited by her future husband; after Hervey's death she produced a three-volume novel, <span class="italic">Snooded Jessaline</span> (1865).<br>
