<span class="headword">Constable,  Henry</span>  (1562&#150;1613), <span class="occ">polemicist and poet</span>, was born in Newark-on-Trent, the only child of Sir Robert Constable (<i>d</i>. 1591) and Christiana, daughter of John Dabridgecourt of Langdon Hall, Warwickshire, and widow of Anthony Forster. His family was distinguished: his grandfather Robert Constable married Katherine Manners, sister of Thomas, earl of Rutland; their second son, Henry's father, Robert, made a judicious marriage whose connections opened up a career of military service and public office&#151;he was knighted on the field of battle by Thomas, earl of Sussex, while serving in Scotland, acted as marshal of Berwick between 1576 and 1578, and became lieutenant-general of the queen's ordnance some time before 23 July 1588. Sir Robert died on 12 November 1591.<br>
<br>Henry Constable matriculated as fellow-commoner at St John's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1578, and took his BA on 29 January 1580 by special grace, nominated first in the <i>ordo senioritatis</i> (possibly because of his social standing). He is mentioned in the registers of Lincoln's Inn on 21 February 1583, but by 12 September was at St Johnston's (Perth), reporting to his father on the cool reception given to Walsingham by the Scottish court. The latter recommended him to the English ambassador in Paris, Sir Edward Stafford. Constable acted as gentleman-spokesman for the protestant cause in Paris between 14 December 1583 and April 1585; he impressed the ambassador, who told Walsingham on 30 May 1584 that he might be used to bolster the protestant fervour of Henri of Navarre. There are reports from this period of plans to journey to meet Beza in Geneva, and to Italy. In May 1585 Constable was at Heidelberg, where he answered an attack on the queen by a Roman Catholic exile, Thomas Throckmorton. There may have been other journeys, given a sonnet to the queen which mentioned his recent travels in Poland and a phrase in his funeral oration which talked of his having been a soldier in his youth. A commonplace book copy survives of Constable's answer to Cardinal William Allen's justification of Sir William Stanley's surrender of Deventer to Spanish troops, printed in 1587.<br>
<br>Constable was probably at court during 1588&#150;9: he attended the earl of Rutland's funeral in March 1588, wrote a sonnet to Penelope Rich on the birth of her daughter in that year, was described as familiar with Arabella Stuart by 1589, and was said by the secretary of the apostolic delegate to France to be a favourite of the queen. He was at Edinburgh in 1589, ostensibly to bring greetings from members of the English court on James VI's marriage; a coded report of the visit to Burghley, dated 20 October, indicates that members of the Essex circle were using Constable to assure James of their loyalty to him above Arabella. Constable was reported to show himself a protestant at the time, an impression confirmed by a text he published in September 1589, <span class="italic">Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots</span> (London, with false Paris imprint; a second edition appeared in 1590). This answered Cardinal Bellarmine's <span class="italic">Responsio ad praecipua capita apologiae</span>. Constable wrote as though a Roman Catholic, arguing that the divisions between the Reformed and Roman churches were so recent as must inspire moderation in claims for absolute truth; French Roman Catholics were urged to support the newly crowned Henri IV. The tract was translated by &#145;W. W.&#146; as <span class="italic">The Catholike Moderator, or, A Moderate Examination of the Doctrine of the Protestants</span> (1623) and answered by Lawrence Anderton and William Smith.<br>
<br>Poetry also engaged Constable's attention at this time. There are three major extant collections of his works. A sequence of twenty-three sonnets, <span class="italic">Diana</span>, was published in London by Richard Smith in 1592 (Constable left with the Essex expedition to assist Henri IV in August 1591, and the preface describes the poems as &#145;by misfortune left as Orphans&#146;). Elizabeth I, his cousin Mary, countess of Shrewsbury, and Penelope, Lady Rich, have been named as his &#145;mistress&#146;. A second edition, with five new sonnets by Constable, eight from Sir Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Certaine Sonets</span>, and a further unassigned forty-one sonnets, came out under Constable's name, probably in 1594, though it is likely that this was Smith's project. The Todd manuscript contains nine groups of seven Italian-form sonnets by Constable on the theme of love. Seventeen &#145;Spirituall sonnettes, to the honour of God: and hys saintes&#146;, in British Library, Harleian MS 7553, fols. 32&#150;40, were not published in Constable's lifetime. His editor, Joan Grundy, speculates that the secular sonnets were written before Constable's conversion  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 59&#150;60, 84&#150;5); the date of the spiritual sonnets is in dispute.<br>
<br>Between Constable's arrival in France and the death of his father he declared himself a Roman Catholic. Living on a small pension from Henri IV, he made Paris his base (at some time he lived at Mignon College), but was also at Rome before August 1595 and in 1600, Rouen on 8 January 1596, Scotland in 1599, Antwerp, and Brussels. However, his connections with the Essex circle continued until 1597, shown in a series of letters to Essex and Anthony Bacon which protested his loyalty to Elizabeth. As a corollary, he declared his support for James's claim to the English throne over that of the infanta, and acted to frustrate Jesuit actions in France (he was a friend of Christopher Bagshaw, the chief protagonist in the archpriest controversy, and in 1598 handed over to the French government letters from English Jesuits). His plans for securing the welfare of English Roman Catholics used his acquaintance with those in power: a college was to be set up in Paris, Henri was to lean on Elizabeth to tolerate recusants, and the conversions of Anne of Denmark, or even of James himself, were to be attempted. On 1 March 1599 Constable landed at Leith; James initially refused him an audience, and though he spoke with Anne, he was ordered by the sessions of the kirk to subscribe to the articles of religion or leave the country. Having regained the king's favour, hunting and conversing on poetry and divinity with him, Constable stayed until September, though he accounted the visit a failure on his return to Paris. Yet he continued to nurse hopes of a conversion, going to Rome in 1600 to ask the pope to support another mission to James.<br>
<br>During this period Constable continued to write on theology: he sent to Bacon in January 1596 an unpublished manuscript on an encounter between French divines, and wrote another on English affairs before 1597 (neither extant). He answered a tract by R. Doleman (Robert Persons), <span class="italic">A Conference about the Next Succession</span> of 1595, which put forward the claims of the infanta. Constable's <span class="italic">Discoverye of a Counterfecte Conference &hellip; for Thadvancement of a Counterfecte Tytle</span> (Paris, 1600, under the false imprint of Cologne) was among a number of tracts which supported James's title. At this time, Constable was described as &#145;a litle man redd face pumpled gray heair and a smale beard&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, Elizabeth, addenda, 34.41).<br>
<br>On James's accession Constable cautiously wrote to certain Scottish friends, and then, on 11 June 1603, to the earl of Rutland and Robert Cecil asking them to intercede for permission for him to return to England. By December he was at court, apparently well received. A warrant of 8 February 1604 allowed him to take possession of his father's lands. He maintained contact with the papal nuncio in Paris, Del Bufalo, as he planned further ways to influence James on the issue of toleration, including an international conference of theologians to dispute differences between the faiths. Cecil was alerted to his schemes: Constable was imprisoned in the Tower from 14 April to 9 July 1604, then confined to his own house, deprived of his inheritance, and imprisoned at least twice (he was in the Fleet on 9 February 1608). He was allowed to leave England on 31 July 1610 and returned to Paris, where he was present at a theological disputation on 4 September 1612. He was sent to Li&egrave;ge by his friend, Cardinal Jacques Davy du Perron, to try to convert Dr Benjamin Carier, a protestant divine, and died there on 9 October 1613.<br>
<br>Constable was highly regarded in his own time as a poet and polemicist; only since the 1950s has his latter role been reacknowledged. He was a notable Roman Catholic convert, who abandoned his home and inheritance to use his family's high standing and his own popularity at court to promote in tracts, disputations, and personal contact the controversial position that devout Roman Catholics could be loyal subjects of the English crown. He was also at the forefront of the development of the sonnet in English literature: the second English poet after Sidney to publish a sonnet sequence and the initiator of a Tridentine aesthetic in his &#145;Spirituall sonnettes&#146;. His &#145;Ambrosiack Muse&#146; was linked to Sidney's in Ben Jonson's praise  (<span class="italic">Underwoods</span>, 27, ll. 25&#150;8), Sir John Harington claimed him as his &#145;very good friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span>, 1591, sig. Bbiii<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">The Return from Parnassus</span> and Gabriel Harvey put him with Edmund Spenser, and he was imitated by poets such as Michael Drayton, Sir William Alexander, and Barnabe Barnes. His most extended contemporary assessment was in Edmund Bolton's <span class="italic">Hypercritica</span> (1618): &#145;a great Master in the English Tongue, nor had any Gentleman of our Nation a more pure, quick, or higher Delivery of Conceit&#146;  (J. Haslewood, <span class="italic">Ancient Critical Essays upon English Poets and Poesy</span>, 1815, 2.250).<br>
