<span class="headword">Nicholson,  William Patteson</span>  (1876&#150;1959), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and evangelist</span>, was born on 3 April 1876 at Cottown, Bangor, co. Down, one of seven children of sea captain John G. Nicholson and his wife, Ellen Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1931). The Nicholsons were devout Presbyterians; William Patteson was the name of their minister in Bangor and three of their children became foreign missionaries. William, however, originally chose a different path, going to sea at sixteen, following education at Fisherwick Presbyterian church school and the Model School in Belfast, to where the family had moved. After a spell as a hard-drinking railway construction worker in South Africa he returned home and experienced a sudden conversion on 23 May 1899. He entered the Glasgow Bible Training Institute in 1901 and among his lecturers were James Orr and James Denney of the Glasgow United Free Church College and the famous Edinburgh preacher Alexander Whyte. In his vacations he assisted his former Belfast minister, Dr Henry Montgomery, in his Shankill Road mission, gaining experience of open-air evangelism.<br>
<br>In 1903 Nicholson began his apprenticeship as an evangelist, employed by the Lanarkshire Christian Union, preaching with some success in a community of coalminers and steelworkers. He married Ellison D. Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1926) of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, in 1907 and the following year he joined the team of American evangelists Chapman and Alexander, with whom he worked in Australia and America. His growing reputation as a preacher led to his ordination in 1914 as an evangelist in the Presbyterian church in the USA and to his appointment in 1918 to the staff of the Los Angeles Bible Institute under its dean, the prominent American fundamentalist R. A. Torrey.<br>
<br>On a visit to his native Ulster in 1920 he was persuaded to undertake a mission in Bangor; this led to a series of missions in Portadown, Lurgan, Newtownards, Lisburn, Belfast, Londonderry, Ballymena, and Carrickfergus, which had a tremendous impact in the province, making his name a household word. The political situation was explosive in the context of the partition of Ireland, accompanied by widespread sectarian violence. Gunfire could be heard during mission services in Belfast and in the first week of the mission in the Albert Hall in February 1922 more than thirty people were killed and almost one hundred wounded in Belfast, yet thousands attended. Nicholson's populist presentation of the gospel attracted large numbers of working men, particularly shipyard workers, normally beyond the ministrations of the churches. His message was simple and stark: turn or burn, Christ or hell, reject the &#145;world&#146;&#151;alcohol, tobacco, dancing, the theatre, and the cinema. Thousands responded&#151;and more than 20,000 in the province professed conversion.<br>
<br>Nicholson has been credited with saving Ulster from civil war, and a republican commented that the men who had been trying to shoot him were now trying to convert him. It has also been suggested, however, that, as in the revival of 1859, the Nicholson &#145;revival&#146; confirmed Ulster protestant consciousness of being different from Catholic Ireland, thereby justifying partition. Nicholson returned to Los Angeles in 1923 but a year later he was back in Ulster to lead a new series of missions, including one in Dublin. His ministry had always been divisive, but now the divisions were sharper. A militant fundamentalist, coming from the conflict between fundamentalists and modernists in America, he attacked alleged modernism in Irish Presbyterianism, contributing significantly to a campaign which culminated in the trial for heresy before the Presbyterian general assembly of a theological professor, Ernest Davey. Davey's acquittal led to a small schism in Irish Presbyterianism but many of Nicholson's converts became ministers and elders in the mainstream Presbyterian church, undoubtedly strengthening its conservative puritan and pietist traditions.<br>
<br>It was not only in Ulster that Nicholson was effective as an evangelist: he held successful missions in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. Perhaps his most improbable evangelistic success was in Cambridge University in 1926. His irreverent populism attracted some undergraduates who affectionately called him &#145;Willie Nick&#146;, though others, including the future archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsay, were permanently prejudiced against evangelicalism by Nicholson's buffoonery and vulgarity. The Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, which had invited him, was greatly strengthened both by the large number of converts and by the impact of Nicholson's ministry.<br>
<br>Later in 1926, while Nicholson was leading a mission in Australia, his wife died suddenly. Subsequently he himself suffered a heart attack and in 1927 he married the matron of the Australian hospital in which he had been treated, Fanny Elizabeth Collett (<i>d</i>. 1979). She returned with him to his home in Glendale, Los Angeles. He had resigned from the Los Angeles Bible Institute in 1924 but had retained his home there and his son worked for the Bible Institute. There were also two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
<br>Nicholson's cardiac problems handicapped his later life and ministry, though he made frequent visits to Ulster and conducted a number of missions without making the impact of earlier years. The Revd Ian Paisley claims that at the beginning of his ministry in what was then a mission hall on the Ravenhill Road in Belfast, Nicholson gave him his blessing, praying that God would give him a tongue as sharp as a cow's in the service of the gospel. Returning to Ireland in 1959, Nicholson suffered a final heart attack and died on 29 October in the Victoria Hospital, Cork. He was buried in Clandeboye cemetery in his native Bangor on 2 November 1959 after a service in Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church.<br>
