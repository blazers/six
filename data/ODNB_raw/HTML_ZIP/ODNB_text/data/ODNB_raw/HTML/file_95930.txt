<span class="headword">Fletcher,  Cyril Trevellian</span>  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">comedian and impresario</span>, was born on 25 June 1913 at Dunoon, Hagden Lane, Watford, Hertfordshire, the only son and younger child of George Trevellian Fletcher, deputy town clerk of Watford, and his wife, Maude Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ginger. Both parents were keen on amateur dramatics. He attended a preparatory school in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, where his father had become town clerk, then Woodhouse School in Finchley, where he persuaded the headmaster to allow him to produce a concert in aid of library funds and cast himself as leading performer: &#145;How did I know, I wonder, that I could do this, never having even been in an amateur concert of any kind?&#146; Nevertheless, after its success, &#145;the school magazine proclaimed the advent of a new comedian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nice One Cyril</span>, 41&#150;2).<br>
<br>Having disappointed his father by failing his French matriculation three times, Fletcher could not bring himself to announce the fact that his real ambition was to make the stage his profession. He decided to work in London, first for a timber firm, then for the Scottish Union and National Insurance Company, where he produced an unofficial office magazine in which he published the first &#145;Odd Odes&#146; that were later to bring him lasting fame. Just as significantly he enrolled at the Guildhall School of Music as an evening drama student. One of his tutors was Kate Rourke, who had been Henry Irving's leading lady. To help pay for his lessons he performed as a comedian at club socials and dinners. Through this he first made contact with the Concert Artistes Association, which enabled him to obtain more contacts for after-dinner engagements. He became a member and was proud of being elected president several times in the 1950s and 1960s; he later became one of their patrons.<br>
<br>After appearing at a Sunday night concert at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1936, when his droll act had received an enthusiastic response, Fletcher was approached by Greatrex Newman, whose seaside show the Fol-de-Rols was one of the most popular of the day. Newman offered him a season at the White Rock Pavilion, Hastings, for &pound;7 a week. The same week his manager at Scottish Union and National asked if he would like to be their junior representative in Rangoon:<blockquote>&#145;Thank you for your confidence in me&#146;, I said, &#145;but I was coming to see you at the end of the week to resign&#146;. &#145;Oh,&#146; he said, rather deprecatingly, &#145;and what sort of job had you in mind?&#146; &hellip; &#145;I am going to be a comedian&#146;, I said. To say he was considerably disconcerted by my answer is a grave under-statement. (<span class="italic">Nice One Cyril</span>, 54&#150;5)</blockquote>Fletcher enjoyed two successful seasons at Hastings with the Fol-de-Rols and was one of the first comedians to appear on the newly opened BBC television service from Alexandra Palace. He also started to become a popular voice on radio via broadcasts for Radio Luxembourg and the BBC.<br>
<br>In 1938 Fletcher was booked at Llandudno and, short of material for a broadcast from the show, decided to recite Edgar Wallace's <span class="italic">Dreaming of Thee: a Lovesick Tommy's Dream of Home</span>, a sub-Kipling piece delivered in a nasal cockney accent. Within days Fletcher realized what an impact he'd made when he heard a bus conductor distributing tickets and impersonating his comic voice: &#145;I became a household name like Guinness or Harpic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nice One Cyril</span>, 64). Fletcher started recording his &#145;Odd Odes&#146; in 1938 for Columbia and Decca which, together with such radio series as <span class="italic">Thanking Yew</span> (named after his catchphrase), consolidated his popularity.<br>
<br>In 1940, when booked for a programme to be broadcast from Bristol, where the BBC's variety department had been relocated during the London blitz, Fletcher met the <span class="occ">actress, singer, and scriptwriter</span> <a name="cosubject_95930"></a><span class="headword">Betty Astell</span>  (1912&#150;2005). Born Betty Julia Hymans at 54 Cranhurst Road, Willesden, London, on 23 May 1912, she was the daughter of Herbert Hymans, drug merchant, and his wife, Estella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oppenheimer. Trained as a dancer, she first sang on BBC radio at the age of twelve, and four years later made her West End stage d&eacute;but in John Galsworthy's <span class="italic">Escape</span> at the Ambassadors Theatre. She took part in John Logie Baird's early &#145;30-line&#146; television experiments from his studio in Long Acre from 1931, and in the BBC's first 30-line transmission in 1932. After the BBC launched its regular television service from Alexandra Palace in 1936 she appeared frequently until the closure of the service during the Second World War. She also appeared in some two dozen films before the war, including <span class="italic">A Tight Corner</span> (1932) with Frank Pettingell, <span class="italic">This Is the Life</span> (1933) with Gordon Harker and Binnie Hale, <span class="italic">Jack of All Trades</span> (1936) with Jack Hulbert, and <span class="italic">The Mind of Mr Reeder</span> (1939) with Will Fyffe. At the time she met Cyril Fletcher she was undoubtedly better known than he was. They first appeared together in a Home Guard concert and married within a year at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 18 May 1941. They would often work together on radio in such comedy series as <span class="italic">Fletcher's Fare</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Mixed Doubles</span> (1957), both written by Bob Monkhouse and Denis Goodwin. They had one daughter, Jill Fletcher, also an actress and comedian.<br>
<br>In parallel with his broadcasting work Fletcher was in demand for variety, and appeared on the bill with several music hall veterans, including Harry Tate, George Robey, Nellie Wallace, Billy Bennett, and Harry Champion. He was flattered when Max Miller took an interest in his act and advised him how to improve it: &#145;For the placing of a gag and for the timing of a joke he had and has no equal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nice One Cyril</span>, 80). After taking part in some Path&eacute; Pictorials, Fletcher's first major film appearance was in the wartime thriller <span class="italic">The Yellow Canary</span> (1943), with Anna Neagle. He most notably played a flamboyant Alfred Mantalini in Alberto Cavalcanti's Ealing production of <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1947). He appeared in the wartime show <span class="italic">Keep Going</span>, the first of many with words and music by Betty Astell in which they were to appear together. For twenty-five years he played fruity-voiced and, at over six feet, strikingly tall pantomime dames in stylish productions written and directed by his wife (who frequently co-starred in them). These often incorporated a harlequinade reflecting the early pantomime tradition. For a memorable production of <span class="italic">Mother Goose</span> at the Cambridge Arts Theatre (1950) their friend the artist Edward Seago painted sixteen watercolours as scenery for his first professional stage commission. They also collaborated on summer shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s which were shrewdly presented under their own management, giving early encouragement to such fresh talents as Harry Secombe, Sheila Hancock, and Anna Quayle. As the 1950s progressed Fletcher's broadcasting career continued with appearances on BBC television's popular <span class="italic">What's My Line?</span> and the long-running radio comedy panel game <span class="italic">Does the Team Think?</span>
<br>
<br>Fletcher was discovered by a new generation when he was invited to contribute &#145;Odd Odes&#146; to reflect situations brought to the attention of Esther Rantzen's BBC1 consumer programme <span class="italic">That's Life!</span> (1974&#150;81). His resurgence in the public eye led to a series of witty books including <span class="italic">Odd Odes</span> (1974), an autobiography, <span class="italic">Nice One Cyril</span> (1978), and several devoted to gardening, including <span class="italic">Cyril Fletcher's Gardening Book</span> (1974).<br>
<br>After he left <span class="italic">That's Life!</span> Fletcher continued his television career by presenting gardening programmes for a few years. In the mid-1980s he and Betty Astell moved to Guernsey. He presented several series about his showbusiness life and friends for BBC Radio 2. On at least one occasion during his final years BBC radio referred to him as &#145;the late Cyril Fletcher&#146;, which amused him greatly. He died at his home in St Peter Port, Guernsey, on 2 January 2005. Betty Astell died in Guernsey on 27 July 2005. Their daughter, Jill, survived them.<br>
