<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bryden,  Beryl Audrey</span>  (1920&#150;1998), <span class="occ">jazz singer and washboard player</span>, was born on 11 May 1920 at 17 Rowington Road, Norwich, Norfolk, the only child of Amos Wilfred Bertram Bryden, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Elsie Maud Tyler Reeves Jones. She was educated at Norwich high school, and while still a teenager started collecting records. At seventeen she joined the local branch of the national Rhythm Club movement. These were social forums where jazz records were played and analysed and &#145;live&#146; music sessions held, and she was the Norwich club's secretary by 1941, when members travelled to London to attend the first English public jam session. On this visit, she also heard black musicians playing at the raffish Jigs Club in Soho, an experience that changed her life.<br>
<br>In 1942 Bryden moved to Cambridge, where she ran that city's Rhythm Club and began singing Billie Holiday's songs. She settled in London when the war ended, determined to become part of the jazz world. She did secretarial work for the Entertainments National Service Association, and visited nightclubs where she got to know the small community of black musicians as well as members of the burgeoning &#145;revivalist&#146; movement which was seeking to rekindle interest in early New Orleans jazz. Among these was Humphrey Lyttelton, whom she met as an employee at Selmer's instrument shop in Charing Cross Road when he came to purchase his first cornet; subsequently she sang with his band. She also worked at &#145;Doc&#146; Hunt's percussion centre, where she encountered the leading drummers, and thus formed a relationship with the Jamaican percussionist Clinton Maxwell. As interest grew in the revival of traditional jazz, Bryden sang with its leading exponents in a semi-professional capacity. She worked as a record company secretary and appeared with the pianist George Webb, the clarinettist Cy Laurie, and the cornettist John Haim's Jelly Roll Kings, before making her recording d&eacute;but in 1948 with the trumpeter Freddy Randall (whose business affairs she conducted). At Rudy Evans's Caribbean Club she admired the French guitarist Django Reinhardt and the American singer Lena Horne, but it was typical of Bryden that, while gaining musical inspiration from so eclectic a range of models, she herself performed material from a jazz repertoire that was simple and basic. She sang early songs by the likes of Bessie Smith and accompanied herself by strumming with thimble-tipped fingers on a metal washboard, a rhythm instrument with a history predating jazz that Smith herself, even in the 1920s, would probably have scorned.<br>
<br>In May 1949 Bryden formed Beryl's Back-Room Boys, with whom she broadcast before joining the trumpeter Mike Daniels as comm&egrave;re and singer at his Delta Jazz Club in Soho. It was there, in 1952, that she met the French clarinettist Maxime Saury; he engaged her to sing with his band at the Vieux Colombier in Paris, her first professional engagement. That city became a second home, and there she formed friendships with notable American expatriates, among them the trumpeter Bill Coleman, the singer Billie Holiday, and the pianist Mary Lou Williams, with whom she recorded. These associations inspired her and gave her the impetus to sit in at &#145;jam&#146; sessions with such distinguished jazz artists as the saxophonist Sidney Bechet. As European re-creations of pre-war traditional jazz grew in popularity in the 1950s, Bryden sang and recorded with the trombonist Chris Barber and played the washboard with his guitarist Lonnie Donegan; their record of <span class="italic">Rock Island Line</span> (1956) sold 2 million copies and entered the British and United States hit parades. She continued to travel in Europe, where she worked with the Dutch Swing College Band and then, as the &#145;trad boom&#146; became big business in Britain, was heard with the genre's more sophisticated representatives such as the trumpeter Alex Welsh.<br>
<br>Away from the jazz scene, Bryden filled lengthy residencies at the elegant Blue Angel nightclub in Mayfair, where she appeared opposite the Grenada-born entertainer Leslie Hutchinson. To outsiders she remained indelibly identified with the raucous milieu of white &#145;trad&#146; and its music-hall trappings, yet she enjoyed contact with a sophisticated artist such as &#145;Hutch&#146;, for he had once played the piano in Harlem and was connected to the source of the black music she loved. She maintained her early links with Caribbean settlers, and when the American vibraphonist Lionel Hampton arrived in London in 1957 she took him to the Sunset Club to &#145;jam&#146; with the newly arrived musicians. In later years she became a confidante of the singer Adelaide Hall, who had settled in London before the war.<br>
<br>Although her talent was modest, Bryden became a fixture of the British jazz scene. It was impossible to overlook her, a larger-than-life figure who dressed in dramatic zebra-striped gowns, wore sculptured blonde wigs, and strummed on a star-spangled washboard. She seldom deviated from a repertoire of songs taken from the lighter side of jazz, and sang these with little variation or rhythmic finesse, yet she earned respect for her sincerity in a male-dominated world that routinely showed hostility to women. She fashioned a carefree, unpoliticized image for herself, but her fascination with authenticity never abated. She continued to travel widely and to practise her hobbies of photography and deep-sea diving, and lived for many years at 166 Gloucester Terrace, Paddington, London, where her walls were covered with jazz memorabilia and her bathroom filled with shells, coral, and other souvenirs brought back directly from the depths of the sea. She was unmarried. Bryden died from cancer on 14 July 1998 at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London.<br>
