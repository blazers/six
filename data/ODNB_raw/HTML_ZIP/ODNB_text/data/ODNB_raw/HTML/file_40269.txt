<span class="headword">Kinnear,  John Boyd</span>  (1828&#150;1920), <span class="occ">politician and agriculturist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 15 March 1828, the eldest son of Charles Kinnear (<i>b</i>. 1795?), of Kinloch, Fife, and Christiana Boyd Greenshields. He was educated at home and then at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where he was a member of the Speculative Society. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in March 1850 and to the English bar at the Inner Temple, London, some six years later, but did not practise. On 12 August 1852 he married Sarah Harriet Frith (1824&#150;1866), the only daughter of George Frith, of Worksop, Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>From 1852 to 1856 Kinnear acted as political secretary to the lord advocate, his most noticeable achievement in this office being his drafting of the <span class="roman">Scottish Bankruptcy Bill</span>. In the 1860s he turned to journalism and acted as leader writer to several journals, including the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, the <span class="italic">London Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. He was also active in this period in the volunteer movement and apparently attached himself at one point to a guards' battalion to improve his drill technique. What was described as &#145;his public spirit and enthusiasm in the cause of freedom, combined with an independent and virile temperament&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 11 Nov 1920), led him, furthermore, to volunteer to help in Italy in the struggle against Austria. Kinnear served as a private in the forces commanded by Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Trentino Mountains in the war of 1866. A similar commitment to national self-determination in Europe is evident from his involvement with, among others, John Stuart Mill and Giuseppe Mazzini, in efforts to set up the Balkan Liberation Society, the aim of which was to create a confederation of Christian Balkan states liberated from Turkish rule.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1868, after the death of his first wife in 1866, Kinnear married Theresa Bassano (1828&#150;1929), the fourth daughter of Clemente Bassano, a Venetian lawyer, active also in London. There appear to have been no children from either marriage. Later that same year Kinnear stood for Fife as an advanced Liberal against the sitting moderate Liberal MP, Sir Robert Anstruther of Balcaskie. He was defeated, in part because his opponent received the votes of Conservatives in the county.<br>
<br>Kinnear's return thereafter to London, and to the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, was to be short-lived. In 1870, following a breakdown in his health caused by the strain of work, he moved to Guernsey on medical advice. The subsequent period, until his permanent return to the Kinloch estate in 1884, was marked by more journalistic activity, on reform issues in general and on Irish and land issues in particular. Kinnear wrote, for example, the article entitled &#145;Land&#146; for the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. In 1881 he travelled to Ireland and returned convinced that the solution to the Irish question lay in a settlement of the land-reform issue, a position he publicized in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Facts about Ireland</span> (1883).<br>
<br>Kinnear was elected to parliament as a Liberal for the new East Fife constituency in 1885 and began a parliamentary career that was cut short by his refusal to support W. E. Gladstone's <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span>. Standing as a Liberal Unionist in 1886, he lost his seat to the Gladstonian Liberal H. H. Asquith. However, he had been involved in farming in Fife since 1882, and his election defeat, together with the prevailing agricultural depression, led him to become still more actively engaged on his estate, taking the management of several of his farms into his own hands. As an agricultural innovator he experimented with new scientific ideas in dairying, imported livestock from Guernsey, ran a profit-sharing scheme for his employees, and opened direct sales outlets for his estate's milk in Edinburgh and St Andrews, all with reported success. He ran the estate business until 1905, when he relinquished control due to advancing age.<br>
<br>In retirement Kinnear remained true to a nineteenth-century concept of personal freedom and of social responsibility based on voluntaryism. He was well known in Fife for his charity, for addresses on religious subjects, and as the first chairman of the Cupar Educational Trust. In his pamphlet <span class="italic">Reform Questions in 1884</span> he had put forward ideas advanced for the time, such as the enfranchisement of women and the abolition of the House of Lords&#151;in his view, the enfranchisement of peers. From 1911 he took his resistance to the reforms of the new Liberalism so far as to face prosecution for non-compliance with the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span>. As a leader of the opposition in Scotland to this measure, Kinnear objected especially to its compulsory elements as an interference with individual liberty, a position which led him to refuse to pay the required premiums.<br>
<br>Kinnear died at Kinloch on 10 November 1920 and was buried on 13 November in Collessie churchyard. His widow died in 1929, by then a centenarian. Kinnear's political fortunes reflected the developments of his time. He remained true to the nineteenth-century old Liberal tradition of individualism and voluntaryism and lived long enough to be clearly out of step with the more collectivist, state-oriented new Liberalism of the early twentieth century. His defeat in 1886 by Asquith, later leader of the new Liberal government whose policy he so much opposed, adds some poignancy to the contrast.<br>
