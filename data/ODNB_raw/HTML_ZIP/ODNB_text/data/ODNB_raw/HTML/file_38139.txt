<span class="headword">Wilson,  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1869), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born in Hull on 12 February 1792, the youngest of at least nine children of David Wilson, lighter owner, of George Yard, Hull, and his wife, Elizabeth Gray. He was baptized at the Dagger Lane Independent Chapel. Apprenticed to John Wilson (no relation) of Wilson, Wilkinson &amp; Co., iron merchants of 47 High Street, Wilson was a junior clerk and then a traveller in the Sheffield district, promoting the sale of iron ore to the local industrialists. In 1814 Wilson married Susannah, daughter of John West, wine and spirit merchant. They had nine sons and six daughters. In 1820, with a growing family, he decided to set up his own business. He opened a yard to receive consignments of iron ore, which he had arranged through an agent in Sweden, and contacts from his time employed as a salesman were invaluable in developing his trade.<br>
<br>In 1821 Wilson joined in partnership with John Beckinton of Newcastle and set up an office at 14 Salthouse Lane, next door to the Hull branch of the Bank of England. The firm of Beckinton, Wilson &amp; Co., iron merchants, was dissolved in 1836, but by this time he was investing in a fleet of sailing ships to carry his own cargoes. In a new partnership&#151;Wilson, Hudson &amp; Co.&#151;he began a regular mail and passenger service to G&ouml;teborg, inaugurated on 2 June 1840. This was his first venture into steam, using vessels chartered from the St George Steam Packet Company. In 1850 his eldest son, David, became a partner and soon six brothers were to be involved in the firm in various capacities. His second son, John West Wilson, was a resident agent in G&ouml;teborg and eventually became a naturalized Swede. Charles and Arthur Wilson were made full partners in 1867 and were by this time effectively running the company, which they transformed from a major European enterprise into an international one with routes to North America and India.<br>
<br>Thomas Wilson was first chairman of the Hull Underwriters' Association, founded in 1867, and spent much of his last years in various charitable enterprises. In 1863 he had given &pound;1500 to the endowment fund of the Hull Seamen's Orphanage and he was appointed chairman in 1866. In 1869 he presided over its annual general meeting, his last public engagement before he died, a week later. Following the purchase of a rival company (Bailey and Leetham) in 1903 the Wilson Line became the biggest privately owned steamship company in the world. Wilson died on 21 June 1869 at his home, Park House, Cottingham, Yorkshire, and was buried in Hull general cemetery, Spring Bank. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36947/', "Charles Henry Wilson (1833&#150;1907)")</script>, Liberal MP for Hull for twenty-five years, was elevated to the peerage in 1904 as first Baron Nunburnholme. Another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36945/', "Arthur Wilson (1836&#150;1909)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36947/', "Wilson, Charles Henry, first Baron Nunburnholme (1833&#150;1907)")</script>], master of the Holderness hunt, frequently entertained the prince of Wales at his home, Tranby Croft, scene of the baccarat scandal in 1890.<br>
