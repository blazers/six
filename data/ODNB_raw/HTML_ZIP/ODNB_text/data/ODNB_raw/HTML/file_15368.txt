<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Gilbert</span>, third earl of Cassillis  (<em>c.</em>1517&#150;1558), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15367/', "Gilbert Kennedy, second earl of Cassillis (c.1492&#150;1527)")</script>, and his wife, Isobella Campbell (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1495, <i>d</i>. in or after 1533). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15389/', "Quintin Kennedy")</script>, who became abbot of Crossraguel, was his brother. The second earl was murdered in late August 1527, and the younger Gilbert's upbringing was entrusted to his uncle William Kennedy, abbot of Crossraguel. According to John Knox, Cassillis was obliged when only twelve or thirteen to subscribe the death warrant of Patrick Hamilton, Scotland's first protestant martyr, who was burnt at the stake at St Andrews on 29 February 1528. This has been interpreted as evidence for the earl's having matriculated at St Andrews University, but he does not appear in its records, and in any case Cassillis was probably only eleven in 1528. On 8 April 1530 he was licensed to go on pilgrimage to France with another uncle, Thomas Kennedy of Coiff. He remained there for about five years, much longer than many Scots spent on the continent, and it was probably then that he received his education. His personal tutor was no less a figure than George Buchanan, who in 1533 dedicated to Kennedy his translation of Linacre's <span class="italic">Latin Grammar</span>, published that year in Paris. By 1536 the two men had returned to Scotland; shortly afterwards Buchanan wrote his <span class="italic">Somnium</span> at Cassillis's family seat in Ayrshire.<br>
<br>Following his return Cassillis emerged as a power to be reckoned with in the west of Scotland, and principally in Ayrshire, where he began a lawsuit against Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, the killer of his father, probably over lands at Turnberry. He was made a member of James V's privy council, attended parliament regularly, and accompanied the king to the Western Isles in 1540. On 3 July 1538, shortly before he came of age, his marriage was granted to Margaret Kennedy of Bargany (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1596), the widow of William Wallace of Craigy, who then married him; they had three sons and two daughters. In November 1538 he received sasine of his earldom, confirmed to him by a charter of entail on 6 February 1541; its revenues have been estimated at about &pound;715 Scots per annum. Cassillis also set about recreating the Kennedy affinity. Many of his kin, surname, and adherents were with him on 25 November 1542, when Sir Thomas Wharton captured him at Solway Moss.<br>
<br>Cassillis was taken to London as an important prisoner of war and initially lodged in the Tower of London. But when news came of James V's death on 14 December, and thus of the accession to the throne of his newly born daughter, Mary, the earl was brought to court and released into the custody of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Influenced by both Buchanan and Cranmer, he emerged in 1543 as a firmly committed protestant, ready to sign articles promising to advance by all the means in his power the marriage of Prince Edward to Queen Mary and to help Henry VIII gain the most important Scottish castles. An English pension of 300 marks must have made it easier for him to swallow treason, but he also had to provide hostages for his good behaviour. They were two of his brothers, David and Archibald, and also his uncle Thomas, and they languished in England for a long time, not returning home before February 1545 or later.<br>
<br>Back in Scotland in March 1543 as one of the Assured Lords, Cassillis was active in the protestant cause, ever promoting &#145;thys godly mariage and union&#146; of Edward and Mary  (Merriman, 112). In April 1544 he was apprehended by the governor, the second earl of Arran, at a time when he was collaborating with the earls of Lennox and Glencairn and with Lord Maxwell to undermine Arran's rejection of the English marriage, but was soon released. At the forefront of plots to assassinate Cardinal David Beaton, at the end of May Cassillis approached the English ambassador Sir Ralph Sadler with such a proposal, though he demanded a reward and a written warrant. Henry was reported as &#145;reputing the fact not meet to be set forward by him, and yet not misliking the offer&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 20/1, no. 834), and his councillors tried to forward the scheme, but Cassillis was discouraged and abandoned the idea. When the deed was eventually done by others, on 29 May 1546, so shocking did it appear that on 11 June Cassillis (along with others of the Assured Lords) swore before his peers at Stirling that he had renounced all his contracts with Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Cassillis was not being wholly dishonest. Although he continued to communicate with the English and to receive letters from them (for example, he was sent ten copies of the printed proclamation of September 1547 and the February 1548 <span class="italic">Epistle</span>), he did little for his former allies. Nevertheless, he remained a committed protestant. Acts of iconoclasm erupted in many of the churches on or near his estates, and he was an early admirer of George Wishart, who in 1545 was invited to preach against the pope and the mass in Ayrshire. Cassillis may have flirted with treason in order to ensure that the government paid well for his support; if so, his tactics paid off, for by 1549 the French had appointed him lieutenant-general of the Scottish army and were paying him a pension to provide 800 light horse. An ally of Mary of Guise, the queen dowager, against Arran in 1544, Cassillis accompanied her to France in 1550 for her meeting with Henri II, and in October 1552 agreed with the earl of Angus and others to support her against Arran (now duc de Ch&acirc;telherault). After she had become regent on 12 April 1554, Cassillis was rewarded on the 20th with the office of lord treasurer.<br>
<br>Although he was firmly against a war with England in the French interest in 1557, Cassillis was one of the eight Scottish commissioners appointed at the end of that year to negotiate in Paris for the marriage of Mary, queen of Scots, to the dauphin, Fran&ccedil;ois. The nuptials were duly celebrated on 24 April 1558 but ultimately proved fatal for several of the Scots who had negotiated them. A dispute as to whether the dauphin should have the Scottish crown matrimonial soured their mission, and as they were returning home four of the commissioners died. Almost inevitably there were suspicions of poison. Cassillis made his will on 8 November and died at Dieppe on the 28th. His body was taken back to Scotland for burial at Maybole, Ayrshire. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15369/', "Gilbert Kennedy")</script>, succeeded to the earldom.<br>
