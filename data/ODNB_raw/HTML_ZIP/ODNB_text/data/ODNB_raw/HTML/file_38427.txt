<span class="headword">Pigou,  Francis</span>  (1832&#150;1916), <span class="occ">dean of Bristol</span>, was born at Baden-Baden, Germany, on 8 January 1832, the second son of William George Pigou, an army officer of Huguenot descent. He had two brothers and four sisters and spent his early childhood outside England. He was educated at the Moravian School at Neuwied, Germany, and at Ripon grammar school, Cheltenham College, and Edinburgh Academy. This was followed by four years at the Divinity School at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1853, and MA in 1857.<br>
<br>Ordained in 1855 by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, he served his first curacy at Stoke Talmage in Oxfordshire. The rector, who was famous for his port, was ninety-two, and immediately gave Pigou all his sermons and all his father's sermons. In 1856 he was rescued from this isolated and moribund parish by a former bishop of Madras, G. J. T. Spencer (1799&#150;1866), who appointed him to the chaplaincy of the Marboeuf Chapel in Paris. After returning to London in 1859, he served brief curacies at St Peter's, Vere Street; St Philip's, Regent Street; St Mary Abbot's, Kensington; and St Paul's, Kensington, before becoming vicar of St Philip's, Regent Street, in 1860. He exercised a lively ministry in this parish, which included fashionable areas as well as appalling slums and rowdy theatre districts. On 3 January 1860 he married Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Somers; they had two daughters. Mary died in 1868, and in January of the following year he married Harriet Maude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gambier.<br>
<br>From 1869 to 1875 Pigou was vicar of Doncaster, and then from 1875 to 1888 vicar and rural dean of Halifax. Thirty-four livings were in his gift. His vigorous style was much appreciated in Yorkshire. He restored Halifax parish church, where there was a famous choir. He was also an honorary canon of Ripon Cathedral 1885&#150;8 and chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria 1871&#150;89. Trinity College, Dublin, awarded him the honorary degrees of BD and DD in 1878.<br>
<br>Pigou became dean of Chichester in 1888, but found the city unbearably sleepy. Following the unhappy ministry there of Dean Burgon, Pigou brought unity and peace to the chapter and was kindly and hospitable to the diocesan clergy. Although he claimed to be a &#145;high-church evangelical&#146;, he adopted the eastward position at communion services, restored the lady chapel for worship, and rescued the cloisters from ruin.<br>
<br>After three years at Chichester, Pigou became dean of Bristol, which offered more scope for his energy. He furnished each altar in the cathedral with a cross, candlesticks, and flowers, provided cassocks and surplices for the choir, entertained the vergers to tea, and took a great interest in the choristers and the choral services. He immersed himself in the social life of Bristol and Clifton. Although never at a loss for conversation or anecdotes, he was given little part in diocesan life, and his attempt to interest younger clergy in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> Greek classes was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span> described Pigou's sermons as being characterized &#145;by real unction if not by profound thought&#146;, but he was popular both for his parochial missions and for his retreat addresses. He published two volumes of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Phases of my Life</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Odds and Ends</span> (1903). He died at Bristol on 25 January 1916.<br>
