<span class="headword">Coolidge,  William Augustus Brevoort</span>  (1850&#150;1926), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born in New York on 28 August 1850, the son of Frederick William Skinner Coolidge, a merchant, of Boston, Massachusetts, and his wife, Elisabeth Neville Brevoort, a New Yorker whose family had made a fortune in the fur trade. Coolidge and his sister were raised by their mother and their aunt, Marguerite Claudia (Meta) Breevort (1825&#150;1876). He was educated at St Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, privately in Paris, and at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, before entering Exeter College, Oxford, in 1869. There he won the university Taylorian French scholarship in 1871, and obtained a first class in modern history in 1873 and a second class in jurisprudence in 1874. In 1875 he was elected to a fellowship of Magdalen College, Oxford, which he held until his death. Coolidge taught history at Magdalen and lived in Oxford until 1896, except for a year (1880/81) as professor of English history at St David's College, Lampeter. He was ordained deacon in 1882 and priest in 1883, holding decidedly high-church theological opinions. When at Oxford he regularly acted as honorary curate at South Hinksey between 1883 and 1896. But &#145;he chose a manner of life which made it for long periods difficult to perform clerical functions&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Coolidge's principal devotions were climbing in and writing about the Alps. He first climbed there in 1865 with his aunt Meta Brevoort, one of the first female mountaineers. The two were well known for their climbs in the Dauphin&eacute; and in the Alps in winter. Coolidge gained a reputation as the &#145;young American who climbs with his aunt and his dog&#146; after Christian Almer, his Swiss guide, gave him Tschingel, a beagle, in 1868. At the age of seventy Coolidge published a list of some 1750 of his own climbing expeditions between 1865 and 1900, including some 900 high ascents. He was equally scrupulous in recording each of Tschingel's sixty-six major peaks and passes, nearly all of which were canine first ascents. He employed this same obsession with accuracy of detail as an editor and author of guidebooks and reference works. He edited the <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span> from 1880 to 1889 and, with William Martin Conway, a series of climbing guidebooks to the Alps. He also edited or revised several other alpine guidebooks and contributed thousands of articles to encyclopaedias and journals throughout Europe.<br>
<br>But Coolidge was meticulous to a fault. His self-righteousness, pugnacity, and impatience in correcting the mistakes of others led to numerous public quarrels with other members of the Alpine Club, such as William Edward Davidson and Edward Whymper. These pedantic disputes often degenerated into bitter internecine rivalries. Coolidge's vanity was also remarkable: one of his Christmas cards consisted in its entirety of his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry within a border of edelweiss.<br>
<br>Although he did not wear his learning lightly, Coolidge's historical writing is of a high quality. His works are erudite but bibliographical in focus. <span class="italic">Swiss Travel and Swiss Guidebooks</span> (1889) is a solid study of the subject, with a separate section on the history of Zermatt. Often considered his major work, <span class="italic">Josias Simler et les origines de l'alpinisme jusqu'en 1600</span> (1904) reprints Josias Simler's <span class="italic">De altibus commentarius</span> (1574), in the original Latin and in French translation, with additional sources and editorial commentary. The introduction to Simler contains Coolidge's historical sketch on mountaineering before 1600. <span class="italic">The Alps in Nature and History</span> (1908) discusses the topography and peoples of the Alps, and the political and mountaineering histories of the region. <span class="italic">Alpine Studies</span> (1912) collects some of his essays, including one on Tschingel.<br>
<br>In 1896 Coolidge moved permanently to Grindelwald, where he lived first at Am Sandigenstutz with the family of Christian Almer and later at Chalet Montana with a servant and a library of over 26,000 volumes. He never married. He died of a heart attack at Grindelwald on 8 May 1926; a memorial service was held for him there three days later.<br>
