<span class="headword">Fielding,  Thales Angelo Vernet</span>  (1793&#150;1837), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, the fourth son of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9403/', "Nathan Theodore Fielding (1746/7&#150;1819)")</script> and Elizabeth (Betty) Baker or Barker (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1806/7), was born in 1793. Although traditionally said to have been born in London, he was baptized at All Saints, Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 4 December of that year. During his youth the family settled variously in Yorkshire, Durham, at Acton, Ambleside, Keswick, and Manchester. He first showed with the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1810. His exhibits at the Royal Academy have been thoroughly confused with those of his father, who presumably taught him, and eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9407/', "Theodore Fielding")</script>, but he was certainly exhibiting there by 1816, and continued to do so until the year of his death. This confusion may also account for the apparent rarity of his work in museums and on the market.<br>
<br>About 1821 Fielding and his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9404/', "Newton Fielding")</script>, went to Paris to work for the print publisher Ostervald on lithographs for <span class="italic">Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France</span> (published as a series from 1824). Together with their eldest brother, Theodore, who was in Paris in 1823, they established an atelier, first in the place Dauphine and then in the rue Jacob. There they painted and sold watercolours, engraved prints, taught pupils from the <i>haute monde</i>, and entertained their fellow artists of the Anglo-French school including Bonington and Delacroix. The latter shared the studio from 1823 and took it over during Fielding's temporary returns to London. At the &#145;English Salon&#146; of 1824 Fielding's <span class="italic">Macbeth and the Witches</span> was critically acclaimed. &#145;Run, friends of Romanticism,&#146; urged Fabien Pillet, &#145;here is Shakespeare by Monsieur Fielding&#146;  (Pillet, 38&#150;9), while Stendhal thought that &#145;in a year's time I will still remember this poor little watercolour&#151;two feet square&#151;and I will have forgotten, as will the public, those oil paintings which plaster the grand salon&#146;  (Stendhal, 114&#150;15).<br>
<br>That summer Fielding toured Switzerland, and he made many of the arrangements for the visit of Bonington, Delacroix, and their friends to London in the following year. Delacroix, whose portrait by Thales descended in the Fielding family until at least 1919, described him as &#145;le meilleur enfant possible&#146;  (Delacroix, 151). Thereafter Fielding seems to have returned to Paris until 1827, when Theodore's move to Addiscombe meant that he had to take over the London business at 26 Newman Street. He was elected associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1829. His most frequent exhibits were landscapes, generally with cattle, but he also produced rustic figures and classical and literary subjects. He was known for pleasing colours and the soundness of his technique.<br>
<br>In 1836 Fielding was himself appointed drawing master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, at a salary of &pound;300 per annum. He died of an apoplectic seizure on 20 December 1837 at 26 Newman Street, which was presumably being redecorated since his death was witnessed by an illiterate builder's mate. He was unmarried, and his brothers were his executors. There are watercolours by him in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Gloucester City Art Gallery.<br>
