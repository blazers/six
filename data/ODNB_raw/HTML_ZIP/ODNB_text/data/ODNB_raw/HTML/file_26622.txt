<span class="headword">Strachey,  John</span>  (1671&#150;1743), <span class="occ">topographer and geologist</span>, was born on 10 May 1671 at Sutton Court, near Chew Magna, Somerset, the only son of John Strachey (1634&#150;1675), barrister at Gray's Inn, London, and his wife, Jane (1643&#150;1727), daughter of George Hodges. Following the early death of his father, he inherited the family seat at Sutton Court. Nothing is known of his early education, but at the age of sixteen he had &#145;grown tall and very like his father in person and humour&#146; and was &#145;at Trinity College in Oxford&#146;  (Rand, 228). He had matriculated at Trinity in 1686 but his stay there was short. The following year he became a law student at the Middle Temple, London, and in 1688 he was admitted a member there. On 10 May 1692 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1722), daughter of William Elletson. The couple subsequently had eighteen children; Henry, the thirteenth, inherited the family estate.<br>
<br>In 1708 Strachey began work on a survey of Somerset, with a view to preparing a county map. His field notebooks, although largely undated, record his progress over the following twenty-five years. A trigonometrical survey, based around thirty-one main stations, was &#145;much in advance of contemporary practice&#146;  (Harley, 3), but his topographical work appears to have been verging on the careless. Based on little more than a series of road traverses, with no angular measurements, it relies on travelling time as a device for measuring distance, despite the fact that he was familiar with more exact techniques. It has been suggested that the topographical work may have been a later phase in the map making, and that the ageing Strachey was in a hurry to finish the project. (Indeed, in the winter of 1735, Strachey was in London and relying on correspondence to fill the remaining gaps in the topographical work.) Published in 1736 the map had only fifty-two subscribers, perhaps a result of the 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. asking price. It contained several major errors and a revised edition (achieved largely through correspondence) was issued in 1738.<br>
<br>It was probably Strachey's survey of his native county that awakened other scientific interests, especially in geology. In 1719 he granted his brother-in-law licence to &#145;Search for open dig or Sink any pitt or pitts for Coal&#146; on the Sutton Court estate. He wrote an account of coalmining in the district, illustrating it with a sectional sketch explaining how the various strata lay with respect to one another underground. This paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Robert Welsted in 1719; later in the same year Strachey was elected a fellow. After travelling to Scotland in 1721 he wrote further on coal and the order of strata, presenting his findings in a 1725 paper to the Royal Society. In 1727 he issued a booklet, <span class="italic">Observations on the Different Strata of Earths and Minerals</span>. He also began writing on soils, strata, and topography, probably with a view to a natural history of the whole country which was unfinished at his death.<br>
<br>Strachey also published a number of antiquarian works, including <span class="italic">An Alphabetical List of the Religious Houses in Somersetshire</span> (1731) and <span class="italic">An Index to the Records</span> (1739). He had the usual responsibilities of a county landowner, serving as the squire, a justice of the peace, and a deputy lieutenant. Although never called to the bar he had chambers in London and maintained a practice as an attorney.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, Strachey married, on 12 January 1725, Christina, daughter of Richard Stavely. They later had one child. Strachey was considered to be &#145;of a very painstaking, as well as of a very dry character&#146;  (J. S. L. Strachey, 7). He died at Greenwich on 11 June 1743.<br>
