<span class="headword">Cooper,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1640&#150;1681), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, may have been the man admitted as a sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1628, graduating BA in 1632 and MA in 1635, and there is reason to suppose he may have then spent time in the Netherlands. It is hard to be sure of anything about William Cooper's early life, but he is probably not to be identified with the Oxford BA (1634) from Gloucestershire (who was possibly the man nominated on 1 March 1648 to Long Marston in that county), nor with the lecturer of St Michael the Belfries, York, one of several nominated or recommended by parliament on 1 March 1642. It is scarcely credible that the parliamentarian and future ejected minister can have been the man who in April 1643 was sequestered from the parish of St Thomas the Apostle in London and ordered to be committed to the Fleet because (among other things) he called the troops of the earl of Essex &#145;rebels and traitors to the king&#146; and &#145;refused to give the sacraments to his parishioners unless they would come up to the rails&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 1643&#150;4, 21&#150;2).<br>
<br>Ironically, however, the Cooper who is the subject of this article appears to have owed his first English benefice to the patronage of none other than William Laud. In February 1640 he was granted a licence to marry Susannah Le Maire, a native of Amsterdam and daughter of John Le Maire, a painter. Le Maire, if Edmund Calamy is to be believed, having &#145;given good content to Archbishop Laud, begged the favour of some presentation for his son in law&#146;, who was accordingly installed in the vicarage of Ringmere, Sussex. Whatever the reason, Laud certainly did present Cooper to Ringmere during an episcopal vacancy; installed before 20 October 1640, he apparently resigned early in the following year.<br>
<br>From 1644 to 1648 Cooper served as chaplain to Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, during her residency at The Hague. It is clear that he was acting during those years in the interest of the parliamentarians. Shortly after his return to England he was requested by the council of state, on 15 May 1649, to preach at the funeral of Dr Isaac Dorislaus whose &#145;execrable murder&#146; had just occurred  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1649&#150;50</i>, 141). On 21 June the council recommended to the revenue committee &#145;that what remains due to Mr Cooper, late minister to the Queen of Bohemia, may be paid to him, he having done special service in the time of his being there, besides his service in the way of the ministry&#146;  (ibid., 201). It seems that this &#145;special service&#146; may have had to do with Cooper's father-in-law, for some years later, in a letter to Thurloe of August 1655, Cooper indicated that Le Maire was acting as an agent for the protectorate government. In the same letter he also urged Thurloe to press on Cromwell the interests of &#145;Alderman Searl, Mr Heycocks, and other honest men of the borough of Southwark, relating to their adventure for Ireland, wherein they are disappointed, and none but his highness can relieve them&#146;; Cooper's statement that these men had &#145;been often here in person&#146; suggests they were using him as a means of access to the corridors of power  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 3.705).<br>
<br>Cooper's connection with the borough of Southwark had originated soon after his return from The Hague. His sermon before parliament on 29 August 1649 celebrated the relief of Dublin and the victory of Michael Jones over Ormond, and appeared as <span class="italic">Jerusalem Fatall to her Assailants</span> under the name of &#145;William Cooper, minister of the gospel at St Olave's Southwark&#146;. For Ireland, Cooper was conventionally anxious that the Rump Parliament remember that firm magistracy be complemented by &#145;a good ministry&#146;, which may &#145;effectually pluck up every bitter root that beareth gall and wormwood, as Popery and prophaneness&#146;. But for England he had some surprisingly radical aspirations, complaining that &#145;some cry for bread to feed their bodies, others cry for bread to feed their souls &hellip; some grow rich upon others poverty, and some proud by others riches&#146;, urging his hearers to &#145;unload heavy burdens, take off every yoke, and let the oppressed go free&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, 29&#150;30).<br>
<br>Cooper went on to play a prominent role in the ecclesiastical politics of the protectorate. He was a morning lecturer at Westminster Abbey in 1654 and appears in its accounts as having been in receipt of &pound;25 for the year 1658. On 20 March 1654 he was named a national commissioner for the approbation of public preachers. Also in that year he served as assistant to the commission of triers for the London ministry, and was named to the Surrey commission on 29 September 1657. The following summer, according to Robert Baillie, he was engaged in high-level discussion of proposals to strengthen the ministry. After the death of Oliver, Richard Cromwell received a letter from General George Monck recommending Cooper as one of &#145;the gravest sort of moderate presbyterian divines&#146; whom the new protector should hear at Whitehall &#145;as often as those of other judgements&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.387). In early 1659, together with Calamy and other presbyterians, Cooper wrote to Richard Baxter urging him to be active in the struggle against Independency. The last protectorate parliament selected three presbyterians, and only one Independent, to preach at the opening session, and picked &#145;Cooper, a Presbyterian, to pray every day&#146;  (Abernathy, 23). Cooper also acquired an assistant: on 5 May John Cooke of King's College, Cambridge, was ordained for his ministry at St Olave's, Southwark, on the authority of the fourth classis of London. On 14 March 1660, after the return of its secluded members, the Long Parliament named Cooper as one of its ministerial &#145;Approvers&#146;.<br>
<br>The Restoration marked no abrupt change in Cooper's fortunes. His living at St Olave's, Southwark, was confirmed by royal grant on 30 July 1660. On 11 December 1661 the denization was granted of Susannah, his wife. Between April and August that year Cooper was one of the presbyterian representatives at the Savoy conference, but the negotiations, aimed to secure their inclusion within the restored Church of England, came to nothing. On 2 June 1662 Secretary Edward Nicholas was informed that William Cooper had presented Lord Chancellor Clarendon with a petition for the king on behalf of the presbyterians &#145;for a connivance or grace of toleration which they say his Majesty may do by his prerogative&#146;, and that he had acted in this matter as spokesman for his co-religionists  (Bosher, 258).<br>
<br>In 1662 Cooper was ejected from St Olave's, Southwark, and moved to Somerset, where he took the Oxford oath in 1666. On 22 July 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian preacher at Crewkerne, and also at his own house at Long Load, Somerset. Here a close colleague was James Stephenson, ejected minister, of Martock, where Cooper had an estate. Both men were selected as overseers of the poor but successfully cited their episcopal ordination as a reason why they should be granted exemption. Cooper contributed a preface to <span class="italic">Cases of Conscience Practically Resolved</span> (1673), by another Somerset minister, John Norman, &#145;late minister of Bridgwater&#146;. But he had fallen far since the days of his national prominence, and was bitter against the failure of his hopes for a godly commonwealth. In 1677 he wrote angrily against &#145;churches grown corrupt and degenerate in doctrine and manners&#146; and recalled the old ideal, &#145;the desire of our souls to have them reduced to their ancient and primitive purity&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">The Good Man Perished</span>, 7). But there was worse to come&#151;Cooper was one of the dissenting ministers imprisoned during the tory reaction of 1681. The manner and date of his death are not known.<br>
