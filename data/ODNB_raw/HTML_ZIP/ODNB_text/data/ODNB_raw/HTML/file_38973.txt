<span class="headword">Macnutt,  Derrick Somerset</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ximenes]</span>  (1902&#150;1971), <span class="occ">crossword compiler and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 29 March 1902 at Coomrith, Carlisle Road, Eastbourne, Sussex, the elder child and only son of Frederic Brodie Macnutt (1873&#150;1949), curate-in-charge of Christ Church, Wimbledon, and his first wife, Hettie Sina (<i>d</i>. 1945), daughter of the Revd Charles Bullock of Worcester and his second wife, Hester, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Savory. His education began at Shrewsbury House preparatory school in Surbiton. In 1915 he gained a scholarship to Marlborough College and in 1920 passed on a classical scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he won three prizes and graduated with a double first in classics. In 1925 he took up a post teaching classics at St Edmund's School, Canterbury, and in 1928 was appointed senior classics master and housemaster at Christ's Hospital, Horsham. On 30 July 1936 he married the nineteen-year-old Mary Long, daughter of Guy Stephenson Long, rector of Aldington, Kent, the marriage taking place in her father's church. There were three children.<br>
<br>Macnutt had always enjoyed crosswords, especially those set by E. P. Mathers (Torquemada) in <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. When Mathers died in 1939 Macnutt composed a puzzle in his style by way of a tribute and sent it to the paper. It was published, and he and two others, F. R. Burrow, a Wimbledon tennis referee, and B. G. Whitfield, a master at Eton College, were asked to take over and provide puzzles in a rota. In 1942 Macnutt assumed full charge for all the puzzles and adopted the pseudonym Ximenes, taking it from Francisco Jim&eacute;nez de Cisneros (1436&#150;1517), the Spanish prelate who was appointed grand inquisitor of Castile following the death of Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada (1420&#150;1498), the first grand inquisitor. The name was appropriate for one who sought to rack the brains of his victims, and the X was a bonus as a symbol of his means of torture. In all he composed 1200 Ximenes puzzles, the last published posthumously on 30 January 1972. He also compiled some of the Everyman puzzles in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> as well as more challenging ones for <span class="italic">The Listener</span> under the name of Tesremos, his middle name reversed.<br>
<br>As a classics teacher, Macnutt had a formidable record. Many of his pupils won Oxbridge scholarships, and he himself was the author of a highly successful Latin course and grammar, written with H. L. O. Flecker and published in 1939. Macnutt's teaching methods in some respects matched those of his cruciverbal eponym. He imposed strict mental discipline on his pupils and coupled it with corporal chastisement in the more recalcitrant cases. The study itself was lined with dictionaries kippered by the 5 ounces a week of the flake that Macnutt had smoked since his undergraduate days. With his plus fours, pebble glasses, booming voice, and extrovert personality, Macnutt remained a force to be reckoned with until his retirement from teaching in 1963.<br>
<br>Macnutt's crossword compilation continued, however, and he was already a cult figure among his loyal solvers. In his final years, about 500 devotees were sending in solutions to his monthly competitions, complete with their own clues. In return they would receive his privately circulated notes. There was a Ximenes tie for the men, a scarf for the women, and a book-plate for merit. At regular intervals there were dinners, the last, in 1968, marking the 1000th Ximenes crossword. The puzzles were always cryptic, in the manner lovingly described by Macnutt in his classic study, <span class="italic">Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword</span> (1966).<br>
<br>Macnutt died, survived by his wife, of a myocardial infarction on 29 June 1971 at his home, Buckmans, Five Oaks, Billingshurst, Sussex, and was buried at St Peter's Church, Slinfold, Sussex. His mantle as <span class="italic">Observer</span> compiler passed to Jonathan Crowther (Azed), as he had wished.<br>
