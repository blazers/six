<span class="headword">Markham,  Frederick</span>  (1805&#150;1855), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18069/', "Admiral John Markham (1761&#150;1827)")</script> and his wife, Maria (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Rice), and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18071/', "William Markham")</script>, archbishop of York, was born at his father's house, Ades, in Chailey parish, near Lewes, Sussex, on 16 August 1805. He went to Westminster School, where he was a cricketer and oarsman, and acted Syrus in the <span class="italic">Adelphi</span>, the Westminster play of 1823. He was expelled for a boating scrape in 1824, and on 13 May of that year obtained an ensigncy by purchase in the 32nd regiment, in which he became lieutenant in 1825, captain in 1829, major in 1839, and lieutenant-colonel in 1842, buying all his steps. When the 32nd was in Dublin in 1830 Markham was second to Captain John Rowland Smyth (<i>d</i>. 1873), then of the regiment, in a fatal duel with Standish O'Grady, a barrister, arising out of a fracas in Nassau Street, Dublin, on 17 March. Smyth and Markham were tried for their lives, and each sentenced to a year's imprisonment in Kilmainham gaol. Judge Vandeleur assured them that the sentence implied no reflection on their conduct in the affair.<br>
<br>Markham subsequently served with his regiment in Canada, and received three wounds when in command of the light company covering the advance in the unsuccessful attack on the rebels at St Denis in November 1837, during the insurrection in Lower Canada. He went out in command of the regiment to India, commanding the 2nd infantry brigade at the first and second sieges of Multan during the Punjab campaign of 1848&#150;9 (he was wounded on 10 September 1848). He commanded the division at Suraj Kund, when the enemy's position was stormed and seven guns taken, commanded the Bengal column at the storming of Multan on 2 January 1849, and was present at the surrender of the city on 22 January and the capture of the fort of Chiniot on 2 February. After joining Lord Gough's army with his brigade on 20 February, he was present with it at the victory of Gujrat. He was made CB and afterwards aide-de-camp to the queen, and attained the rank of colonel in 1850.<br>
<br>Markham, a wiry, active man, was all his life an ardent sportsman. When at Peshawar in April 1852 he made a long shooting expedition in the Himalayas in company with Sir Edward Campbell, bt, an officer of the 60th rifles on the governor-general's staff. They visited Kashmir and Tibet, penetrating as far as Ladakh and bringing back trophies of the skulls and bones of the great <i>Ovis ammon</i>, the burrell, gerow, ibex, and musk deer. Markham published a narrative of the journey, <span class="italic">Shooting in the Himalayas: a Journal of Sporting Adventures in Ladak, Tibet, and Cashmere</span> (1854).<br>
<br>Markham returned to Britain on leave, and in March 1854 was sent back to India as adjutant-general of the queen's troops. In November he was promoted major-general and appointed to the Peshawar division, but when within two days' journey of his command was recalled for a command in the Crimea. On 30 July 1855 he was appointed to the 2nd division of the army before Sevastopol, with the local rank of lieutenant-general. He commanded the division at the attack on the Redan on 8 September 1855. He was just able to witness the fall of Sevastopol before his health, which had suffered much by his hurried journey from India, broke down. He returned home and, apparently unmarried, died in London, at Limmer's Hotel, on 21 December 1855. He was buried in the family vault at Morland, near Penrith.<br>
