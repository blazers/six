<span class="headword">Petrie,  (Frederick) Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1772, <em>d.</em> 1842), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized on 28 April 1772 at St Mary's, Lambeth, the son of Henry Petrie, a schoolmaster in Stockwell, Surrey, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was intended to follow in his father's profession, but soon showed a marked preference for antiquarian research. He was a faithful topographical artist, and before 1810 carried out a large number of sketches of historic buildings in southern England and northern France. Between about 1800 and 1809 he also painted several hundred watercolours, mostly of churches and castles in Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Bedfordshire. He had taught French and drawing to Thomas Dibdin, a pupil at his father's school, and the two remained close friends. Dibdin introduced Petrie to George John, second Earl Spencer, who warmly encouraged his researches. Petrie assisted Dibdin with his bibliographical works, leading his friend to claim that &#145;his knowledge of ancient manuscripts, places him second to none&#146;  (Dibdin, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 716). On the death of Samuel Lysons in 1819, Petrie was appointed keeper of the records in the Tower of London, and in 1830 his edition of the <span class="italic">Magni rotuli scaccarii Normanniae</span> was published. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1820. After prolonged study of the materials for early English history, Petrie saw the need for the publication of a complete &#145;corpus historicum&#146; for the period. A similar scheme had been suggested by the Scottish antiquary John Pinkerton, about 1790, and keenly advocated by Edward Gibbon, but after Gibbon's death it had lapsed. Petrie was the first to revive it. During 1818 and 1819 various meetings were held at Earl Spencer's house to further the scheme, at which it was agreed that a project of such national significance should be publicly funded. An appeal was made for government aid, and Petrie was chosen to draw up a plan. He aimed to make the body of materials to be published absolutely complete, and to include extracts from Greek and Roman authors containing references to early Britain, as well as copies of inscriptions on stone or marble, letters, charters, bulls, proceedings of councils and synods, laws, engravings of coins, medals, and seals, in addition to general histories, annals, and chronicles of England, and histories of particular monasteries.<br>
<br>The plan was presented to the record commission in 1821, and was sanctioned by the government and parliament. Work began in 1823, with Petrie as chief editor, assisted by his brother-in-law the Revd John Sharpe (1769&#150;1859). The Welsh portion was entrusted to John Humffreys Parry (1786&#150;1825) and to Aneurin Owen, and was published in 1841. Petrie's section progressed steadily until 1832, when it was interrupted by his illness. But in 1834, when the whole text of the first volume had been completed, and a large collection of materials made for further volumes, the work was suspended by an order of the record commissioners. It had been criticized by Francis Palgrave as intrinsically defective, because the project was based on the methods of Dom Bouquet, the French historian, who advocated dispersing extracts in chronological order instead of printing entire texts.<br>
<br>Petrie was retired in 1840, and awarded compensation for loss of office. He died unmarried at his house at Stockwell Place, Stockwell Road, Stockwell, Surrey, on 17 March 1842, before the project was revived. His large collection of books was sold at auction by Evans over three days from 23 June 1842. One volume was finally completed and published in 1848 by Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy (who had been trained by Petrie), bearing the title <span class="italic">Monumenta historica Britannica, or, Materials for the history of Great Britain from the earliest period to the Norman conquest</span>. Hardy acknowledged valuable aid derived from Petrie's manuscripts in his <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue of Materials</span>, published in 1862.<br>
