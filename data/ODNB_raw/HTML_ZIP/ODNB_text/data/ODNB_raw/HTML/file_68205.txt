<span class="headword">Bourne,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1584, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, the son of Henry Bourne, a London cordwainer, was apprenticed on 25 March 1601 to the London printer Cuthbert Burby, who had a shop in Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange. Burby died before Bourne completed his apprenticeship, but bequeathed Bourne the lease of his shop and its stock. Freed by Mrs Burby on 26 March 1608, Bourne spent the rest of his life in those premises. In May 1608 he was granted a loan by the Stationers' Company to assist young members trying to establish themselves in business, and he entered his first title, a religious work, in the Stationers' register on 24 September. Burby's widow signed over part of her husband's copyrights, mostly in religious works, to Bourne the following year, and he was elected to the company's livery in 1616.<br>
<br>Trained as a printer, described as a bookbinder in later life, Bourne is best known as a bookseller. Like Burby, he specialized in theological works, notably the sermons of Arthur Dent and the writings of Daniel Featley. He held the right to sell printed bills of lading and, according to a former apprentice, refused to deal in plays. He also sold the occasional travel narrative as well as accounts of strange occurrences and news of foreign affairs, predisposing him perhaps, like his later business partner Nathaniel Butter, to an interest in publishing newsbooks, the endeavour in which Bourne would achieve his greatest notoriety, if not his greatest success. In 1620 he borrowed further money from the company, probably to finance a new business venture he had embarked on: the publication of news. Initially he collaborated with his fellow apprentice and neighbour Thomas Archer, who dealt primarily in ephemera, then with a small syndicate of news publishers, from which eventually emerged a partnership between Bourne and Butter that dominated news publishing for roughly two decades. It seems that the more flamboyant Butter was the front man for the operation, while the steadier Bourne looked to the business end of the partnership, especially financing. Together they developed the regular weekly newsbooks, known as corantos, reporting about events in the Thirty Years' War. The newsbooks supported the protestant cause in the war and, like the majority of Bourne's publishing collaborations, were consistent with a Calvinist outlook.<br>
<br>If Bourne was not as flamboyant or as cantankerous a figure as Butter, he still had brushes with the regulatory authorities. In March 1630 Bourne and two other booksellers were examined by the high commission for selling dangerous books which all three claimed had been left on their doorstep in the night by unknown persons. A privy council order of October 1632 banned publication of the corantos, and Bourne and Butter were explicitly warned to cease publication. Almost exactly one year later the news partners were chosen as members of the Stationers' Company's governing body. In May 1636 Bourne re-entered in the Stationers' register his lucrative copyright to publish bills of lading printed in French, Italian, and Dutch, as well as indentures for Virginia, St Kitts, and the Somers Islands, and bills of debt for money owed on tobacco. In February 1637 he leased additional warehouse space from the company; in June he was named one of the feoffees for property the company owned in Wood Street, London; and in July he was elected to serve as warden of the company.<br>
<br>The following December Bourne and Butter were granted a royal patent to revive the newsbooks in exchange for &pound;10 a year toward the restoration of St Paul's Cathedral. But the revival was short-lived, and by March 1640 the corantos had folded for good. Bourne and Butter parted ways, and Bourne, focusing on success within the ranks of the company, was re-elected warden in July 1641. A few months later he paid &pound;6 to the company for their attendance at the funeral of his first wife, possibly named Ann, buried on 8 September 1641 at St Michael, Cornhill. In his capacity as warden he seized pirated copies of a work for which he owned the copyright, <span class="italic">The Holy Table, Name and Thing</span>, but was sued in chancery. He persuaded the company to contribute towards his legal costs, provoking controversy for years. Bourne was elected master of the company in 1643. Throughout the decade he published and republished the popular religious works of Daniel Featley as well as <span class="italic">Le Mercure Anglois</span>, a news publication for Huguenot exiles in England, and a news serial about the Turks which ran to only four issues. In July 1651 he was again elected master, and during the 1650s he acted as a feoffee for two company properties.<br>
<br>Bourne prospered as a stationer, paying marriage portions of &pound;300 each for three of his daughters, but as his health began to wane in the late 1650s, so did his career as a stationer. He bound his last apprentice in 1657 and made a will on 2 March 1658. He published with his son-in-law, William Hope, who had married his daughter Etheldred before 1641. The parish register of St Michael, Cornhill, records the burial of Nicholas Bourne on 6 April 1660. His will, proved on 17 April 1660, included bequests to a sister, his mother-in-law, an aunt, a number of grandchildren, and a &pound;5 legacy to the company paid by his widow, Jane, in 1661. He left no surviving son to succeed him in his business and so bequeathed a number of copyrights to Etheldred and William Hope.<br>
