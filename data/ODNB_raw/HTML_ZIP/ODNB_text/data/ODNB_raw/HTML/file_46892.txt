<span class="headword">Dunn, Sir  James Hamet</span>, first baronet  (1874&#150;1956), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 29 October 1874, in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, only child of Robert Dunn (1846&#150;1875), boatbuilder, and his wife, Elizabeth Abrahams (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of John Joudrey. He was educated at St Luke's School, Bathurst, and in 1895&#150;8 studied law at Dalhousie University, Halifax. He was called to the bar of Nova Scotia and North-West Territories in 1898 and to the bar of Quebec in 1901. The following year he bought a seat on the Montreal stock exchange where he swiftly made a fortune.<br>
<br>In 1905 Dunn moved to London, where he established the merchant bank of Dunn, Fischer. He was a wily and opportunistic financier, who often puffed his stocks through corrupt journalists and misleading prospectuses. The Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company (in 1912) was the most prominent of many Canadian-incorporated foreign utility companies which he floated to British investors through tightly controlled syndicates. His successes were checked in 1913 by the disappearance of his partner C. Louis Fischer, leaving large debts.<br>
<br>Dunn turned to commodity trading, and during the 1914&#150;18 war was involved with the British government in securing nickel supplies from Norway. He had previously cultivated the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, lending his Rolls-Royce car and hoping for a baronetcy; this was finally gazetted in 1920, ostensibly in recognition of his Norwegian services, but in reality because of contributions to the Lloyd George political fund. He is depicted in <span class="italic">Sunflower</span>, a novel of the 1920s by Rebecca West, as Sir Jack Murphy, &#145;a verminous little shyster&#146; whose baronetcy is scandalous  (209).<br>
<br>During the 1920s Dunn worked with a controversial Belgian financier, Alfred Loewenstein, in promoting, by the technique of stock pyramiding, a series of electrical and artificial fibres trusts, notably the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale d'&Eacute;nergie Hydro-&Eacute;lectrique and British Celanese. This activity was terminated by Loewenstein's mysterious death in 1928. Dunn continued to underwrite industrial flotations, and together with Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen and Lord Trent bought Boot's the chemists from American control in 1933. In 1935 Dunn took charge of the Algoma Steel Corporation in Canada (gaining full control in 1944). In two decades he transformed the company by vertical integration and strong management from a nearly bankrupt concern into Canada's second largest primary steel maker. He also diversified Algoma into iron-ore mining and other lucrative activities. As a result he left an estate in Canada worth nearly C$70 million. His successes with Algoma finally vested him with the semblance of respectability, and in Canada he received honorary degrees from several universities and was made an honorary king's counsel in 1949.<br>
<br>Dunn married, in 1901, Gertrude Paterson (<i>d</i>. 1957), daughter of Herbert Molesworth Price, timber merchant, of Quebec; they had one son and four daughters. Immediately after their divorce in 1926, Dunn married Irene Clarice Douglas (1898&#150;1977), daughter of Henry William Richards, mill owner, and divorced wife of the eleventh marquess of Queensberry; they had one daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1942, and on 7 June the same year he married his former secretary, Marcia Anastasia (1909&#150;1994) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/54730">Aitken,  Marcia Anastasia</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/30358">Aitken,  William Maxwell</a>], daughter of John Christoforides, and afterwards wife of his friend and biographer Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook.<br>
<br>Dunn had a thin build, vivid blue eyes, sharp features, and a mouth like a trap. Implacable in enforcing his own interests, he could be irascible, callous, obdurate, impulsive, and demanding. Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart in 1947 described him as &#145;the meanest and hardest man in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 2.618). A lavish and even charming host with sybaritic tastes, he was a munificent art collector, who commissioned thirteen portraits of himself, including one by Dal&iacute;, in which he was portrayed in the character of Caesar Augustus. His foibles (such as his insistence on having his shoelaces ironed) amused his friends. He hated solitude, was a food faddist, hypochondriacal, and prone to neurotic fears. Dunn died of heart failure, on 1 January 1956, at Dayspring, on Passamaquoddy Bay, near St Andrews, New Brunswick, his ashes being buried in the grounds there, under a favourite tree.<br>
