<span class="headword">Seward,  William</span>  (1747&#150;1799), <span class="occ">anecdotist</span>, the only son of eminent London brewer William Seward, was born in January 1747, probably in London. He began his schooling at a small seminary near Cripplegate, and in 1757 moved to Harrow School. For a time he attended Charterhouse School and matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 4 June 1764 at the age of seventeen. On quitting university, Seward travelled on the continent, particularly in Italy, where he was inspired with a passionate interest in art and literature.<br>
<br>Possessing considerable property but with no taste for business, on his father's death Seward sold his interest in the brewery to pursue a literary life. His conversation and cultured tastes gained him entry to London's foremost literary circles. He became a &#145;great favourite&#146; of the Thrales at Streatham and was godfather to their daughter Cecilia  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 3.35). In 1776 Seward introduced Charles Burney to the Thrales, and Fanny Burney later declared that she &#145;always retained a true esteem for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 3.175). Seward was an intimate friend of Samuel Johnson, and became a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71336', "Essex Head Club")</script> founded by him in 1783. He was also a member of the Eum&eacute;lean Club that met at the Blenheim tavern in Bond Street. Inspired by Johnson's highland tour of Scotland, Seward made a similar journey in 1777, travelling first to Edinburgh with letters of introduction from Johnson to James Boswell and James Beattie. He was among the friends who attended Johnson's funeral, and he assisted in the composition of his epitaph. He was elected FRS on 11 February 1779&#151;which he once quipped stood for &#145;Fellow Remarkably Stupid&#146;&#151;and FSA on 25 March 1779  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney</span>, 9.143). In June 1783 Seward's interest in art took him to Paris and Flanders, where he studied the pictures of Claude Lorrain. His wide circle of acquaintance in England included Tom Paine as well as the poet Anna Seward, who was no relation.<br>
<br>In an effort to dispel his habitual ennui, Seward began collecting anecdotes of celebrated personalities in a commonplace book. He contributed many of these, along with literary discoveries and other articles, to periodicals including the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> and Cadell's <span class="italic">Repository</span>. The <span class="italic">Whitehall Evening Post</span> printed his series &#145;Reminiscentia&#146;. His &#145;Drossiana&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> beginning in October 1789 and later formed the basis for his five-volume <span class="italic">Anecdotes of some Distinguished Persons</span> (1795&#150;7), which passed into a fifth edition in 1804. This was followed in 1799 by two volumes of <span class="italic">Biographiana</span>. These volumes were deservedly popular, and Seward was praised for his &#145;felicity &hellip; in hitting off the leading features of his subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 440). Seward's efforts as an anecdotist earned him the posthumous epithet of the &#145;publick bagman for scraps&#146;, from Thomas Mathias, in the <span class="italic">Pursuits of Literature</span>  (Mathias, dialogue 2, ll. 61&#150;2).<br>
<br>Among his close acquaintances, Seward had the &#145;Character of a Hypocondriack&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thraliana</span>, 1.358). In August 1781 he made the &#145;western tour&#146; in England and returned having consulted &#145;a doctor, apothecary, or chemist, belonging to every town at which he had stopped&#146;, adding that this was also his method of gathering information about a place and its surroundings  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 1.219). In 1788 Seward appears to have been temporarily confined in a strait-jacket as a result of insanity. Four years earlier Hester Thrale had written of being &#145;plagued &hellip; with a Visit from Seward, who I think is going out of his Senses by the oddity of his Behaviour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thraliana</span>, 1.595&#150;6, n. 4). In his later years Seward habitually spent the winter in London and the summer in the country. Seward's portrait was painted by George Dance on 5 May 1793, and engraved by William Daniell. A second portrait of him, by J. G. Wood, was engraved by Holl, and published on 3 June 1799. Despite his declared intention never to marry, Hester Thrale alludes to his having proposed to her shortly after her husband's death in 1781. Having now grown very corpulent, Seward died of a dropsy at his lodgings in Dean Street, Soho, on 24 April 1799, and was buried in the family vault at Finchley on 1 May.<br>
<br>Although Seward was said to be &#145;fond of his joke, and would sometimes indulge it at the expence of his good-nature&#146;, he was also praised for his liberality to writers and artists  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 440). Fanny Burney, for whose <span class="italic">Camilla</span> Seward helped raise subscriptions, wrote of him that &#145;his mind is all solid benevolence and worth&#146;. She was struck by his &#145;singularities and affectation of affectation&#146;, but believed that this was &#145;mere quizziness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 3.175). He subscribed 10 guineas toward purchasing an annuity for Richard Porson, and Charles Burney recounted Seward's &#145;good natured plan&#146; for lessening the debt of an insolvent bookseller  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Ribeiro, 1.262). In an elegy to Seward's memory, Ann Hunter praised his &#145;kindly mild affections&#146; and &#145;warm benevolence&#146;  (Hunter, 71). Hester Thrale succinctly observed of Seward's character that he was:<blockquote>beneficent tho' frigid, and amiable though he does not even wish to be beloved: yet his Moral &amp; Literary Character inspire so much respect, and his perpetual ill Health so much Tenderness, that one loves him in spite both of one's self and him. (<span class="italic">Thraliana</span>, 1.220&#150;21)</blockquote>
