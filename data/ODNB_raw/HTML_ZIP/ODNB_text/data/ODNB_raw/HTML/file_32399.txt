<span class="headword">Child,  Thomas</span>  (1839&#150;1906), <span class="occ">Swedenborgian minister</span>, son of John Child of Darlington, heckle-comb maker, and his wife, Grace McKay, was born at Arbroath, Forfarshire, on 10 December 1839, and brought up there in the Free Church of Scotland. He was sent to a relative at Darlington to learn tanning but ran away. After serving an apprenticeship to a chemist he was employed by manufacturing chemists at Horncastle, Lincolnshire; there, as there was no Presbyterian congregation, he joined the Congregational body and subsequently, with a view to its ministry, studied at Airedale Independent college, Bradford (1862&#150;7). He was Congregational minister successively at Castleford in the West Riding of Yorkshire (1867&#150;8), and Sittingbourne, Kent (1870). In October 1870 he married Louisa Martha Hadkinson, whom he had met in 1868 in Matlock, Derbyshire, where he was recuperating after an illness. His perusal of the <span class="italic">Appeal</span> by Samuel Noble led him to accept the doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg, and in 1872 he left Sittingbourne to join the New Church. As a preacher of the New Church, he officiated at Newcastle upon Tyne (1872), moving to Lowestoft (1874) and to Bath (1876), where he was ordained on 15 October 1878. In March 1886 he became assistant at the chapel in Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, to Jonathan Bayley, who died on 12 May 1886, when Child became his successor. He died on 23 March 1906 at his home, Melrose, Milton Road, Hanwell, Middlesex, and was buried on the 29th in Highgate cemetery; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Child's writings and lectures in support of New Church principles, for the publication of which Sir Isaac Pitman was responsible, enjoyed considerable vogue. His chief work was <span class="italic">Root Principles in Rational and Spiritual Things</span> (1905), a reasoned reply to Haeckel's <span class="italic">Riddle of the Universe</span>.<br>
