<span class="headword">Clarke, Sir  Caspar Purdon</span>  (1846&#150;1911), <span class="occ">museum director and architect</span>, was born at Richmond, co. Dublin, on 21 December 1846, the second son of Edward Marmaduke Clarke, of an old Somerset family, who married Mary Agnes, daughter of James Close of Armagh. Clarke was educated at Gaultier's School, Sydenham, Kent, and at Beaucourt's School in Boulogne, France. In 1862 he entered the National Art Training Schools at South Kensington, where he studied architecture. In 1865 he entered the office of works, and distinguished himself in work for the Houses of Parliament. The following year he married on 20 November Frances Susannah, daughter of Charles Collins, with whom he had eight children. In 1867 Clarke was transferred to the works department of the South Kensington Museum. In 1869 he superintended the reproduction of mosaics in Venice, Florence, and Rome, and in 1872 he supervised the decorative work at St Mark's Church, Alexandria. In 1874 he was appointed HM superintendent of works for the consular buildings in Tehran, where he spent the following two years, completing during this time the Roman Catholic church of St Mary.<br>
<br>On his return to London in 1876, Clarke was sent on a purchasing tour for the South Kensington Museum through Turkey, Syria, and Greece. A similar mission took him in 1879 to Spain, Italy, and Germany. He acted as architect of the Indian section and commercial agent to the Indian government at the Paris Exhibition, 1878. He continued to be active as an architect and undertook several commissions in the Indian style. These included Lord Brassey's Indian museum in Park Lane in 1887 and the Indian palace at the 1889 Paris Exhibition. His most renowned architectural commission&#151;in conjunction with William Young&#151;is the Indian hall at Elvedon, Suffolk, commissioned in 1899 by Edward Cecil Guinness, first earl of Iveagh (1847&#150;1927). Clarke later also advised Iveagh on the furniture and tapestries for Elvedon. In 1880 he arranged the Indian collections at South Kensington, and after spending two years as special commissioner in India, became keeper of the India Museum at South Kensington in 1883. In that capacity he displayed splendid gifts as an organizer. His acquisitions included the Hamzanama folios, early Mughal illustrations of the epic adventures of Hamza by northern Indian and Iranian artists <i>c</i>.1562&#150;77. He also bought contemporary crafts, architectural woodwork, and drawings. He was consequently appointed keeper of the art collections at the South Kensington Museum in 1892, assistant director in 1893, and director in 1896. He also filled the posts of royal commissioner at the Paris Exhibition in 1900, and at St Louis in 1904. In 1905 he resigned his directorship of the South Kensington Museum (renamed in 1899 the Victoria and Albert Museum) and accepted the post of director of the Metropolitan Museum, New York, from which he retired on a year's leave of absence on account of ill health in 1909, when he returned to Britain. He resigned his directorship in 1910, but remained European correspondent of the museum. He died at his home, 17 Penywern Road, Earls Court, London, on 29 March 1911, and was buried at Kensal Green. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Clarke's strenuous official duties did not prevent him from notable work in other directions. He organized and conducted evening art classes for artisans in Soho, Lambeth, and Clerkenwell in 1870; and among the other buildings which he designed and built were Cotherstone church, Durham (1876), Alexandra House, Kensington (1886, for students at the Royal College of Music), and the National School of Cookery, South Kensington (1887). He visited America to study the housing of female students at Boston in 1884, edited a work on oriental carpets for the Austrian government in 1892, and besides lecturing, contributed numerous papers on architecture, Eastern arts and crafts, and arms and armour to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of Indian Art</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects</span>, and other publications. In 1910 he published a catalogue of the <span class="italic">Arms and Armour at Sandringham</span> which had been given to Edward VII on his visit to India as prince of Wales in 1875&#150;6. He was made chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1878, in which year he also received silver and bronze medals at the Paris Exhibition, which were followed by a gold medal in 1889. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 4 May 1893. He was created companion of the Indian Empire in 1883, and knighted in 1902. He was also given the commander's cross of the order of the crown of Germany. Of Clarke's three sons and five daughters, the eldest son, C. Stanley Clarke, became assistant keeper of the Indian section of the Victoria and Albert Museum, which largely owes its present status to the joint contribution of father and son.<br>
