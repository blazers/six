<span class="headword">Deasy,  Rickard</span>  (1812&#150;1883), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Clonakilty, co. Cork, on 23 December 1812, the second son of Rickard Deasy (1766&#150;1852), of Clonakilty, brewer, and his wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Caller (<i>d</i>. 1853). He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1833, MA in 1847, and LLB and LLD in 1860. He was called to the Irish bar in the autumn of 1835 and quickly acquired a large practice. In 1849 he was made a queen's counsel, and at once became the leader in the equity courts and on the Munster circuit. On winning a by-election in 1855 Deasy became MP for Cork and held his seat until he was promoted to the bench in January 1861. In 1858 he was elected a bencher of King's Inns, Dublin, and became third serjeant-at-law. He was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland in Lord Palmerston's administration in July 1859. In 1860 he succeeded Lord Fitzgerald as attorney-general for Ireland, and was sworn a member of the Irish privy council. His appointment as baron of the court of exchequer after Baron Greene's resignation in 1861 was one of a number of Liberal appointments of Roman Catholics to the bench. Deasy held the post for seven years and was then promoted by the Conservative government to the post of the lord justice of appeal. In 1861 Deasy married Monica (<i>d</i>. 1880), younger daughter of Hugh O'Connor of Sackville Street, Dublin; they had three children, Rickard, Henry, and Mary. Both sons were soldiers; and both Rickard and Mary predeceased their father.<br>
<br>Deasy held the post of lord justice of appeal until his death at his home, 41 Merrion Square East, Dublin, on 6 May 1883. He was buried in Dean's Grange cemetery, Dublin. His death was a great blow to the Court of Appeal, as he was an accomplished lawyer, and a patient and impartial judge. Described by Chief Justice Morris as the Bayard of the Irish bench, Deasy is best remembered for pushing through the <span class="roman">Landlord and Tenant Law (Amendment) Act (Ireland)</span> of 1860 (otherwise known as <span class="roman">Deasy's Act</span>), which codified and regularized the law in Ireland relating to the duties of landlord and tenant.<br>
