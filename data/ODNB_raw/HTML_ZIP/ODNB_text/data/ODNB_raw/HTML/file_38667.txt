<span class="headword">Binstead,  Arthur Morris</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Pitcher]</span>  (1861&#150;1914), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 6 January 1861 at 106 Great Titchfield Street, Marylebone, London, the son of Arthur William Binstead, manager of the Continental Gallery in Bond Street, and his wife, Mary Ann Morriss. Educated at various private schools in London, but primarily at Dr Templeman's school in Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, Binstead's first job was in a counting-house, which he left to join Joe Capp, a &#145;rough diamond&#146; who ran a sporting press agency. During his time there he was introduced to the seamier side of racing, as he mixed with bookies' runners, tipsters, and &#145;the boys&#146; who made their living from fleecing those innocents foolish enough to cross their path.<br>
<br>In 1884 Binstead joined the <span class="italic">Pink 'Un</span> (the <span class="italic">Sporting Times</span>), whose eccentric staff included the Dwarf of Blood (Colonel Newnham-Davis), the Stalled Ox (Jimmy Davis), and the irrepressible Shifter (Willie Goldberg). The <span class="italic">Pink 'Un</span> was famous for its uninhibited comment on racehorse owners, welshing bookmakers, theatrical productions, and any other topic of the moment. Binstead, whose nickname Pitcher came from his skill at &#145;pitching the tale&#146;, made his mark by drawing on a wider field. Accounts of fights in the Pelican Club or the measures taken by his <span class="italic">Pink 'Un</span> colleagues to evade bailiffs were interspersed with the adventures of costermongers in the East End.<br>
<br>A tall, well-built man with a grave and courteous manner, Binstead had the gift of making friends at every level of society and took a pride in drawing his stories from life. The characters on the disreputable fringes of racing furnished him with inexhaustible material. His readers learned how to enter a racecourse without paying and the need for caution in casual acquaintanceships made in West End bars. The anecdotes of his barber in Covent Garden (Funny Fred) appeared regularly in the <span class="italic">Pink 'Un</span>, as did the experiences of Captain Flash, the leader of a race-gang. The word &#145;prison&#146; in one of Binstead's articles nearly led to an action for slander by the gallant captain, but this was settled out of court with damages of two whiskies, a ham sandwich, a cigar, and 5<i>s</i>. in cash. And the slanderer would have kept his 5<i>s</i>. had he won the toss!<br>
<br>Binstead married Laura (<i>b</i>. 1864/5), daughter of Henry Hirschfield, at the Central United Synagogue in Great Portland Street, London, on 22 December 1886; they had a daughter, Dora, and a son. Binstead wrote for the <span class="italic">Pink 'Un</span> for some twenty-eight years and it became understood that he would succeed the proprietor, John Corlett, when the latter retired. He never forgave Corlett for selling the paper to West de Wend Fenton in 1912 and left immediately with several others to start a rival paper, <span class="italic">Town Topics</span>.<br>
<br>Binstead's two books of reminiscences, <span class="italic">A Pink 'Un and a Pelican</span> (1898; written with Ernest Wells) and <span class="italic">Pitcher in Paradise</span> (1903), were admired by such stylists as E. V. Lucas and P. G. Wodehouse and remain among the best and most amusing records of bohemian London at the end of the nineteenth century. He died of Bright's disease and bronchitis at his home, 291b Camden Road, Holloway, London, on 13 November 1914 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. His wife survived him.<br>
