<span class="headword">Blayney,  Benjamin</span>  (1727/8&#150;1801), <span class="occ">Hebraist and Church of England clergyman</span>, may have been baptized at St Swithin's, Worcester, on 18 February 1727, and may have been the son of Thomas and Betty Blayney. He was educated at Worcester College, Oxford, where he matriculated aged eighteen on 1 July 1746; he graduated BA (1750) and MA (1753). Afterwards he became a fellow, and eventually vice-principal, of Hertford College, and took the degree of BD in 1768.<br>
<br>In July 1766 Blayney was employed by the university's Clarendon Press to prepare a corrected edition of the Authorized, or King James, Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The request followed the publication by Cambridge University Press of editions in 1743 and 1760, prepared by F. S. Parris, which&#151;in addition to the first edition&#151;served as the scholarly basis for Blayney's new text. Blayney's folio edition, for which he was paid &pound;350, appeared in 1769. It was hailed for its accuracy and is now considered the most significant advance in the presentation of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> as a modern text in which eighteenth-century norms of grammar, word order, and spelling were imposed. In his report for the delegates of the Clarendon Press (reprinted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 39, 1769, 517), Blayney outlined his principles and methods of editing but said relatively little about his highly influential, and lasting, changes to the text. It is these that have made Blayney's the authoritative edition which remains in use, &#145;the twenty-first-century text of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146; being &#145;essentially Blayney's text&#146;  (Campbell, 136). Unfortunately a large part of the impression was destroyed in a fire which took place at the bible warehouse in Paternoster Row, London, though copies can still be found in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the British Library, London.<br>
<br>Blayney received much assistance in his Hebrew studies from the celebrated William Newcome, later archbishop of Armagh, also a fellow of Hertford, to whom he dedicated several of his works. In 1775 he published <span class="italic">A dissertation by way of inquiry into the true import and application of the vision related, Dan. ix. 24 to the end, usually called Daniel's prophecy of seventy weeks</span>. This work attracted considerable attention, and was translated into German by Johann David Michaelis. (A corrected edition was published by the author in 1797.) In 1784 Blayney published new translations of <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span> and <span class="roman">Lamentations</span>, and in 1786 and 1788 two sermons, <span class="italic">The Sign Given to Ahaz</span> and <span class="italic">Christ the Greater Glory of the Temple</span>. In 1787 he was appointed regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford, and in the same year was made a canon of Christ Church and received the degree of DD. In 1790 he published an edition of the Hebrew&#150;Samaritan <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, transcribed in ordinary Hebrew characters, with critical notes. His last production was a new translation of the prophecy of <span class="roman">Zechariah</span> (1797).<br>
<br>Like his friend Archbishop Newcome, and many other eminent biblical scholars of the period in England, Blayney did not escape a reputation for heterodoxy, and was the object of several very acrimonious attacks, from which he defended himself with exemplary fairness and courtesy. He died at his rectory of Poulshot, Wiltshire, on 20 September 1801. By his will he directed that his unpublished writings, among them &#145;A new version of the Psalms&#146;, &#145;Critical comment on the Psalms&#146;, and &#145;Notes on Isaiah&#146;, after being submitted to the judgement of his friend and patron Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, should be deposited in the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth. His will also requested that he be buried at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, with his late daughter from his marriage to Jane (<i>d</i>. before 1801)  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1363).<br>
