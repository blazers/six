<span class="headword">Langley, Sir  Geoffrey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1200&#150;1274), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was the son of Walter de Langley, minor knight with property at Siddington in Gloucestershire and at Pinley near Coventry, and his wife, Emma de Lacy (<i>d</i>. in or before 1222). He was probably of age by 1222, which suggests a date of birth about 1200, and first appears in royal service in 1233&#150;4 as constable of St Briavels, Gloucestershire. He joined the royal curia, and was appointed knight-deputy to the earl marshal and marshal of the household.<br>
<br>The Gascon campaign of 1242&#150;3 proved a turning point in Langley's career. On his return he was given custody of the honour of Arundel. From late 1244 to early 1250 he was associated with the general forest eyre conducted under the headship of Robert Passelewe (<i>d</i>. 1252). On 4 March 1250 he was made chief justice of the forest on both sides of the Trent, an office which he exercised for two and a half years until 25 October 1252. As a forest justice he earned some notoriety. According to Matthew Paris, Langley had gained a reputation for parsimony while marshal of the household. Now he was to be particularly zealous in the interests of the king. Langley's northern eyre was a very lucrative one, and undoubtedly caused murmurings.<br>
<br>By 1252 Langley was at the height of his power and high in royal esteem, being a particular favourite of the queen. A member of the council, he functioned as a guardian of the king's young daughter, Margaret, queen of Scots, during 1252&#150;3, but made himself unpopular in Scotland and was removed. Then in March 1254 he took responsibility for the English and Welsh lands of the young Prince Edward. This proved to be a disaster, however, for he provoked the Welsh rising of November 1256. Paris says that he conducted himself here in a typically high-handed manner, while the Dunstable annalist writes of him as trying to bring Wales under English law, and ordering the introduction into that country of shires and hundreds, while boasting before the king and queen that he had the Welsh in the palm of his hand. Out of favour with the king, he was eventually pardoned on 14 February 1258. In 1262 he was one of the auditors investigating the accounts of Prince Edward's bailiffs. He was unpopular, however, with the opposition baronage, and was among those royalists whose lands were pillaged in the spring of 1263.<br>
<br>Although Langley inherited some property, and acquired other estates through marriage, it was his service to the crown that raised his family's fortunes. He added to the estates received directly from the crown by acquiring the estates of landowners indebted to Jewish moneylenders. He paid considerable attention to the improvement and consolidation of his estates. At its height his income from land must have been at least &pound;200 per annum. In addition he was able to acquire an heiress and her estates for his eldest son, Walter. Langley was married twice, first to Christine, of unknown parentage, and second to Matilda, daughter of Robert of Brightwell. He died in 1274, by 22 September; he was buried, as were Matilda and his son Walter, in the church of the Franciscans in Coventry. The division of his estates between the two branches of his family, based in Warwickshire and Gloucestershire respectively, helps to explain why the Langleys failed to rise further, as Geoffrey's own career might well have suggested.<br>
