<span class="headword">Muir,  John William</span>  (1879&#150;1931), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at 202 North Woodside Road, Glasgow, on 15 December 1879, the son of John Muir, a journeyman farrier, and his wife, Annie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Doyle). He became a skilled tradesman at the precision engineering firm of Barr and Stroud, of Anniesland, Glasgow. On 30 October 1918 he married Catherine McMillan Fraser (<i>b</i>. 1882/3), daughter of Alexander Fraser, a shipbuilder's clerk; they had two children.<br>
<br>Little is known about Muir's intellectual development before the outbreak of war in 1914, when he was the editor of <span class="italic">The Socialist</span>, the organ of a small Marxist and syndicalist sect, the Socialist Labour Party. He was drawn at some point into the shop stewards' movement, which expressed the opposition of (especially skilled) workmen on Clydeside to the dilution of labour and to government controls over the munitions workforce. The movement became the Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC), and Barr and Stroud was one of its strongholds. From October 1915 to March 1916 the Clyde Workers' Committee threatened to disrupt munitions production, and Muir, who was regarded as its intellectual leader, presented its case for workplace control of production at famous meetings with Lloyd George as minister of munitions at Christmas 1915. The Clyde Workers' Committee actually disrupted the war effort far less than did more conservative groups of workmen, but in February 1916 the government moved against it. Muir, together with the future communist William Gallacher, was gaoled in April for twelve months for publishing an article entitled &#145;Should the workers arm?&#146; in the CWC journal <span class="italic">The Worker</span> (29 January 1916, 73&#150;4); the article said that they should not, and neither Muir nor Gallacher wrote it. The arrests of Muir and Gallacher, and the simultaneous deportation of other leaders of the CWC to Edinburgh, succeeded in breaking up the committee.<br>
<br>Muir's journey away from Marxism may have begun in September 1914, when he resigned his editorship of <span class="italic">The Socialist</span> because of his support for British participation in the war. It accelerated on his release from prison in 1917, when he came under the influence of John Wheatley, the chief local organizer and ideologue of the Independent Labour Party, which Muir joined. His revolutionary syndicalism had by this time mutated into non-revolutionary guild socialism. Muir subsequently stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for the marginal seat of Glasgow (Maryhill) in 1918. He won the seat in 1922, however, and held it until 1924. Muir was one of the ten Glasgow Labour MPs who were sent off to London by a mass meeting at which, appropriately, &#145;The Red Flag&#146; and <span class="roman">Psalm 124</span> were sung. Like other Clydeside Labour MPs, he spoke passionately in parliament about poverty and unemployment, and was an instinctive supporter of Scottish home rule. During 1923 he persistently attacked the government, especially on pensions and the organized emigration of the children of the unemployed to the dominions, and he delighted in gadfly attacks over alleged scandals. In the 1924 Labour government, he became parliamentary under-secretary at the Ministry of Pensions. His minister was not in the cabinet, however, and the Ministry of Pensions had little influence at a time when Philip Snowden and William Graham (respectively chancellor and financial secretary to the Treasury) insisted on a balanced budget. Muir's role was largely confined to answering parliamentary questions, but he did serve on a committee to examine the draft <span class="roman">Pre-War Pensions Bill</span> of the previous government, which the Labour government endorsed. Lack of time, money, new ideas, and a parliamentary majority all prevented the Labour government from making any significant innovations in social policy.<br>
<br>After losing his seat in 1924, Muir was picked by G. D. H. Cole to run the Workers' Education Association, which was deeply split between Marxist and non-Marxist wings. Muir had been firmly in the latter camp since his switch from syndicalism to guild socialism, and he served as a faithful ally to Cole until forced by ill health to retire in 1930. He then returned to Glasgow, where he died in Robroyston Hospital of a spinal tumour on 11 January 1931; he was buried at the western necropolis. In obituaries Muir was described as a &#145;humble and unassuming man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>) and also &#145;of singularly gentle and lovable disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Forward</span>, 10 Jan 1931). He was of slight build, and his friends thought his health had been permanently damaged by his wartime imprisonment. Muir was survived by his wife.<br>
