<span class="headword">Wilford,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1396), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of Exeter</span>, may have originated at Nottingham (where his illegitimate son John sold property in 1413), or at Wilford, a village a few miles south of Nottingham. But he came to be closely associated with Exeter, where he is first recorded in 1363, by when he had married Elizabeth, widow of John Hull, a wealthy and politically prominent draper of the latter city. John Hull left one daughter and three sons, one of whom, Henry Hull, served as Robert Wilford's apprentice, and also as executor for both Robert and Robert's son <a href="#cosubject_52231">William [<i>see below</i>]</a>. No doubt his marriage provided the material basis for Wilford's trading career. He was the richest and most active merchant in Exeter during the last three decades of the fourteenth century. From 1367 he regularly imported wine, dyestuffs, iron, oil, salt, herring, and other commodities, often transporting these goods in one of three ships he co-owned. His exports of cloth and numerous imports of woad, madder, brasil, alum, and potash reflected his investments in the cloth industry, as did his regular business dealings with dyers, drapers, and merchants in Devon, Somerset, and London. He accumulated extensive property holdings in Exeter and its suburbs, including many shops in prime commercial locations. In 1377 he paid the highest murage tax in the city (15<i>s</i>.); as Exeter's leading citizen he lent money to the city on several occasions, to finance such projects as the construction of a new barge and the paving of the streets.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly Wilford came to dominate the city government of late fourteenth-century Exeter. He served as mayor an extraordinary thirteen times between 1373 and 1394, and also acted as receiver (the city's chief financial officer) twice, steward once, councillor fifteen times, and elector sixteen times. MP for Exeter in 1377 and 1381, he also officiated three times as mayor of the city's staple. His influence outside the city is evident in his appointment as controller of customs at the port of Exeter in 1364, collector of the poll tax in Exeter and its suburbs in 1377, justice of the peace, and member of several commissions of oyer and terminer in Devon. He enjoyed particularly close connections with the Courtenay earls of Devon; listed as an esquire of Earl Edward (<i>d</i>. 1419) in the latter's livery roll of 1384/5, Wilford was also paid for unspecified services on several occasions between 1381 and 1396. Indeed his links with the family covered several generations; Earl Edward's grandmother, the dowager Countess Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1391), named Wilford as one of her executors, and Wilford later made arrangements in his own will for prayers for the souls of Margaret, her husband Earl Hugh (<i>d</i>. 1377), and their son William Courtenay, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1396).<br>
<br>Robert Wilford died at Exeter between 7 July and 28 August 1396. In his will he left one third of his estate to be sold for prayers for his soul and for the souls of relatives and friends, another third to his wife, Elizabeth, for the term of her life, and the remaining third to his son William, who also inherited his mother's share when she died some time after 1404. His executors included John Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1417), who was probably his natural son. Although John seems never to have married and to have died without heirs, his birth was no impediment to success as a merchant oligarch in Exeter, where he served in such high city offices as receiver, councillor, steward, and elector on many occasions between 1395 and 1414, and was constable of the staple in 1413 and member of parliament in 1414.<br>
<br>Inevitably, however, John Wilford was overshadowed by his half-brother <a name="cosubject_52231"></a><span class="headword">William Wilford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1413), who enjoyed a political and commercial success similar to his father's. Elected mayor of Exeter seven times between 1400 and 1412, he too served the city as receiver, steward, councillor, elector, constable, and mayor of the staple, and as member of parliament five times between 1395 and 1411. Like his father he was appointed to commissions of inquiry and oyer and terminer, and had connections with the Courtenays, acting as a witness to a quitclaim of Sir Edward Courtenay, son of the Earl Edward whom his father had served, although William also wore the livery of Bishop Stafford of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1419). William Wilford continued his father's interests in the cloth trade, exporting cloth overseas and aulnaging it for domestic sale. His imports, however, were less varied, concentrating largely on wine and woad for dyeing textiles. A shipowner like his father, he was probably the same William Wilford who gained the attention of chroniclers for his exploits as admiral of a fleet of west-country ships which captured numerous French ships loaded with rich cargoes off the coast of Brittany in 1403. Besides seizing the cargoes and burning many of the ships, Wilford also landed at Penmarch on the south-west coast of Brittany, and led his troops some 18 miles inland, ravaging the surrounding villages and countryside.<br>
<br>The Wilfords' standing in Devon allowed William to marry Margaret, widow of Robert Cruwys of Morchard, Rackenford, and East Anstey in Devon, and daughter of Sir Robert Cornu of Thornbury. When William Wilford died in 1413, probably before 26 April, he left a daughter, Elizabeth, who by then had married John Parker of Exeter, and an under-age son, Robert, who eventually received the bulk of his property, including 100 marks reserved exclusively for his support as a minor. His executors included his wife, Margaret, and his half-brother, Henry Hull. To another half-brother, William Hull, he left part of his share in a ship, while to his bastard half-brother, John, Wilford bequeathed a jewel worth 4 marks. His other bequests included &pound;10 and the revenues from a croft outside the south gate to build and maintain a water conduit in Exeter, along with gifts to the local religious houses, and 4 marks for forgotten tithes. At his death, his goods were valued at &pound;228 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.; in 1412 his estates, which included extensive possessions in Exeter inherited from his father, as well as his wife's properties and lands he had acquired in Frogmore and Crediton, yielded an annual income of at least &pound;22.<br>
