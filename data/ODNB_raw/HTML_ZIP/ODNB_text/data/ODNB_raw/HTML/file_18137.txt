<span class="headword">Marshall,  Henry</span>  (1775&#150;1851), <span class="occ">military surgeon</span>, was born on 23 November 1775 at Kilsyth, Stirlingshire, the son of John Marshall, a farmer. He studied medicine at Glasgow College, and in May 1803 was appointed surgeon's mate in the Royal Navy. In January 1805 he left the navy and became assistant surgeon to the Forfarshire regiment of militia; in April 1806 he moved to the 89th regiment. With the latter he served in Buenos Aires, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in Ceylon.<br>
<br>In 1809 Marshall was gazetted as assistant surgeon to the 2nd Ceylon regiment, and in 1813 he was promoted surgeon of the 1st Ceylon regiment. He served in the Second Kandyan War (1815&#150;18), and in 1817 his botanical observations on Ceylon's main export, cinnamon, were read before the Royal Society by Sir Joseph Banks. This work was characterized by the accurate observation and attention to detail common to his later publications on military matters. In 1821 he published a book on the medical topography of Ceylon, and that same year he returned home and served as staff surgeon in Edinburgh and at Chatham. In 1825 he supervised the medical inspection of recruits at Dublin. He was promoted to the position of deputy inspector-general of hospitals in 1830, shortly before his retirement. In 1832 he married Anne (1801&#150;1890), eldest daughter of James Wingate of Westshiels, Roxburghshire.<br>
<br>Marshall was deeply interested in statistics, and many of his writings were concerned with comparative statistical analyses of disease and mortality among the troops of different military stations. He used statistics to highlight the conditions of service endured by the common soldier. In 1835, with A. M. Tulloch, he made an investigation of the health of the troops in the West Indies, the findings of which laid the foundation for improvements in the sanitary conditions of the troops. Marshall became known as the father of medical statistics. In 1828 he published his <span class="italic">Hints to Young Medical Officers of the Army on the Examination of Recruits</span>, in which he described forms of malingering and feigning of disease popular among the troops. The <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span> recommended this book to all medical officers in the army. Four years later Marshall wrote another book dealing with the enlistment and pensioning of soldiers. He argued that the conditions of the army actively encouraged malingering. Soldiers were enlisted for life and the only means of discharge was through disability. He thus urged the implementation of a new scheme where soldiers could obtain pensions through good conduct and length of service. This new attitude towards the soldier was reflected in the pension warrant of 1833 and in subsequent warrants. Marshall was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1839.<br>
<br>Marshall was instrumental in improving the conditions of the soldier both in service and in retirement. He campaigned for shorter service, better general and sanitary education of the troops, and the reduction of brutal punishments such as flogging and branding. His work in this area gained widespread attention in 1847, when a soldier died from injuries received as a result of whipping. Marshall was not just a medical reformer, but an army reformer. In 1847 he received an honorary MD degree from the University of the State of New York. He contributed regularly to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">United Service Journal</span>. He died in Edinburgh after a prolonged illness on 5 May 1851, and was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
