<span class="headword">Warelwast,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1137), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Exeter</span>, was a Norman who took his name from Ver-&agrave;-Val, some 5 kilometres north-west of Yvetot (Seine-Maritime), then on the demesne of the abbey of St Wandrille. His family, education, and career before 1087 are unknown. Although Hugh the Chanter, a hostile chronicler, claimed that he was no scholar (<i>scholasticus</i>), this, except possibly in the narrowest sense, is clearly wrong. His career in diplomacy at the highest ecclesiastical levels shows that he was a rhetorician and could speak, as well as read and write, Latin. And the subjects of his diplomacy and his work as a royal justice prove that he was well versed in law, probably of various kinds. As he sent his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94377/', "Robert de Warelwast")</script>, to school at Laon and, when bishop, was a great patron of Augustinian canons, Laon could have been his own alma mater.<br>
<br>Warelwast appears first at the very beginning of William Rufus's reign as a royal clerk, and he served Rufus as a specialist in diplomacy at the papal curia until the king's untimely death. He may well have been in the royal hunting party, also attended by the king's brother Count Henry, in the New Forest on 2 August 1100, when Rufus was killed. Certainly he transferred immediately to Henry's side, thus disregarding the claim to the throne of the eldest brother, Robert Curthose, for he attested the new king's letter, sent shortly after the hasty coronation on 5 August, to the exiled Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, inviting him to return. That he witnessed third, after a bishop and a bishop-elect and before two important barons, one an earl, is proof that Henry was glad, despite his general dislike of Rufus's servants, to recruit the clerk; and Warelwast served him for the whole of his reign, although after 1120 blindness began to restrict his activities.<br>
<br>As a trusted ambassador to the pope, Warelwast handled first Rufus's standing difficulties with his archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, over the &#145;ancestral&#146; royal customs in the English church, travelling to Rome in 1095, perhaps 1096, and 1098. Although he could not secure Anselm's deposition, he did manage to neutralize Urban II (<i>r</i>. 1088&#150;99). He then took care of Henry I's dispute with Anselm over the investiture of bishops and abbots, with visits to the curia in 1101, 1103, 1105&#150;6, and 1107. He must be regarded as one of the architects of the compromise of Bec (1106) which settled the English investiture dispute. Finally, he pursued the king's interests in the Canterbury&#150;York quarrel over primacy, with embassies in 1116 (perhaps), 1119, and 1120. Eadmer, Anselm's companion and biographer, reports Warelwast's actions on a few of these occasions in some detail. His tone softens from his outrage at the clerk's examination of the archbishop's baggage, piece by piece, &#145;as though he was a fugitive and criminal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, ed. and trans. Southern, 98) on the beach at Dover in 1097 as he prepared to leave for exile, to his eventual acceptance that in 1105&#150;6 he was working for peace and was genuinely concerned over Anselm's weak health. In the meantime he marvels at the ambassador's fearless, indeed audacious, bearing at the papal curia and his skilful conduct of his business. In 1103 Warelwast used &#145;threatening words&#146; to Pope Paschal II (<i>r</i>. 1099&#150;1118) at the hearing of the case concerning investitures. He declared that all present should clearly understand that, whatever might be said there on this subject, &#145;my lord, the king, would rather lose his realm than suffer the loss of the investiture of churches&#146;. To which the pope replied, &#145;And let me tell you before God, Pope Paschal would rather lose his head than allow him freely to retain them&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis pontificum</span>, 112)&#151;intemperate words in open court, but a deal was done behind the scenes. Eadmer believed that the distribution of money and the threat of cutting off English subsidies were important weapons in Warelwast's armoury. The ambassador had no qualms about exploiting the insecure Urban's need for Henry's support or the weaker character of his successor.<br>
<br>Henry I rewarded his clerk by earmarking Warelwast for the bishopric of Exeter, vacant since Osbern's death in 1103, and put him in the archdeaconry until the settlement of the quarrel over investitures allowed his consecration by Anselm on 11 August 1107. These ecclesiastical offices seem hardly to have weakened Warelwast's closeness to the king. He appears to have been with him in Normandy from August 1111 to July 1115, in 1118, and from June 1123 to September 1126; and these may not have been the only occasions. The many absences from his diocese determined his style of government and required him to create a subordinate structure. Exeter, under the quasi-monastic rule of St Chrodegang, and presided over from 1050 until 1103 by two former clerks of Edward the Confessor, had become old-fashioned. The new bishop brought it into the new age. He replaced the single, personal archdeacon with four territorial archdeaconries; he probably enlarged the cathedral chapter to twenty-four canons and established two dignitaries, a treasurer and a precentor; he reformed Crediton Minster, the earlier see of the Devon bishops, as a satellite community; and <i>c</i>.1114 he started the rebuilding of the cathedral church. By 1133, four years before his death, when the church was dedicated, it extended to a west front flanked by the two great Norman towers that still survive in the transepts.<br>
<br>In the diocese at large Warelwast reformed in the 1120s the secular colleges at Plympton, Bodmin, and St Stephen's, Launceston as convents of Augustinian canons regular. Plympton, his favourite foundation, repaid by remembering him as a prelate intent on eradicating married priests and starting his reforms at the top. However that may be, he was, in a lawful way, a good family man. He made one nephew, Robert, his archdeacon and another, William, his steward, in effect his deputies in spiritualities and temporalities. He seems also to have burdened his church by enfeoffing an excessive number of knights on the episcopal demesne. Although it can hardly be thought that he fulfilled the prognosticon at his consecration, &#145;When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours &hellip; but the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind&#146;  (<span class="roman">Luke</span> 14: 12&#150;13), he was clearly a man of many virtues. Not only did he enjoy the trust of both his royal masters, but he also earned the respect of the two popes with whom he negotiated. And even Anselm, the victim of much of his diplomacy, bore him no lasting grudge. He was a progressive and reforming diocesan bishop, a religious and probably good man. He and his nephew Robert were members of the Exeter Kalendar guild; and just before his death he retired to Plympton, where he was presumably admitted as a canon <i>ad succurrendum</i>, and where, after his death on 27 September 1137, he was buried in the chapter house of the priory. He was succeeded as bishop by his nephew, Robert de Warelwast, archdeacon of Exeter; and the two were remembered as great benefactors of the cathedral church.<br>
