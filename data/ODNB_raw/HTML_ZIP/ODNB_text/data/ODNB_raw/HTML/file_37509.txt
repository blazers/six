<span class="headword">Hannington,  Walter <span class="st"> [Wal]</span></span>  (1896&#150;1966), <span class="occ">trade union official and political activist</span>, was born on 17 June 1896 at 22 Randolph Street, Kentish Town, London, the youngest of four sons and sixth of seven surviving children of Henry William Hannington, foreman bricklayer of Kentish Town, and his wife, Eliza Smith. Born and reared in lodgings in the basement of a three-storey house in a working-class district of north London, Wal Hannington attended the local elementary school from the age of five.<br>
<br>Hannington left school at fourteen and after several jobs became apprenticed to a toolmaker, joining the Amalgamated Society of Toolmakers in March 1916. Largely self-taught in Marxist literature, he joined the Marxist British Socialist Party (BSP), where he came into contact with Russian Marxist exiles such as Maksim Litvinov and Georgy Chicherin. By 1917, aged twenty-one, he was a foreman in the Beta Engineering works in Camden Town and president of the Kentish Town branch of the Toolmakers' Society. The First World War, which the BSP opposed, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia reinforced his commitment to militant activity as part of the shop stewards' movement in the engineering trades.<br>
<br>After a period of unemployment in 1919 Hannington found work at the government-run Slough Transport Depot where he became chairman of the shop stewards' committee, organizing strikes and demonstrations against its eventual closure in April 1920. In July of that year he followed the Toolmakers' Society into the merger which created the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and in the same month became a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in which the BSP was absorbed. Both the AEU and the CPGB were to retain his allegiance throughout his life.<br>
<br>But it was as a leader of the unemployed that Hannington rose to national prominence. Already established as a meticulous organizer, a good platform speaker, and an activist with a flair for publicity, he was instrumental in October 1920 in bringing together representatives of unemployed groups in the capital into a London district council of unemployed with himself as organizer. Demonstrations were staged outside poor-law offices with the slogan &#145;Work or full maintenance at trade-union rates.&#146; In April 1921 fifty delegates from England and Wales set up a national organization, the National Unemployed Workers' Committee Movement (NUWCM), with Hannington as national organizer. In 1922 it planned the first of a series of national hunger marches which were to become the NUWCM's principal contribution to the inter-war years. Seen as a subversive organization by the government, the NUWCM was quickly penetrated by police informers and its activities were harried at local and national level.<br>
<br>In 1922 Hannington received his first term of a month's imprisonment for uttering seditious words. Unabashed, he made a clandestine visit to Moscow in 1923 as a delegate to the Red International of Labour Unions. In late 1925 he was one of twelve leading communists arrested and tried on charges of sedition and incitement to mutiny, for which he received twelve months' imprisonment. Released in September 1926, following the defeat of the general strike, he organized national hunger marches in 1929, 1932, and 1934, which were largely ostracized by the labour movement and were harassed by the police, sometimes leading to violence. As a result of the 1932 hunger march Hannington served another three months in prison for offences against the 1931 <span class="roman">Incitement to Disaffection Act</span>.<br>
<br>The later 1930s saw small triumphs amid a larger failure. Although led by communists, Hannington's movement was criticized by the Communist Party for failing to politicize the unemployed, large numbers of whom joined the movement only to leave it quickly once work was obtained. By the mid-1930s it was past its peak, but it played a prominent part in the agitation which led to the suspension of the National Government's Unemployment Assistance Board scheme early in 1935. The now renamed National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM) mounted a last national march in 1936 which obtained C. R. Attlee and Aneurin Bevan as platform speakers for its rally in London, but even this success was overshadowed by the publicity attracted by the apolitical Jarrow crusade at the same time, the one hunger march in which the NUWM was not involved. With the outbreak of war, the activities of the NUWM were suspended, and finally wound up in 1943. Hannington returned to work as a lathe turner and while serving as convener of shop stewards was elected a national organizer of the AEU in November 1941. Taking up the post in February 1942, he held it until defeated in an election in 1951. In 1952 he was elected assistant divisional organizer for division no. 25, retiring in June 1961. Ebullient, sociable, and respected even by those who disagreed with his political views, Hannington saw his work in the AEU rewarded in 1938 with the Tolpuddle award, the top award of Britain's trade union movement, and the AEU's special award of merit in 1962.<br>
<br>Hannington unsuccessfully contested parliamentary seats in 1929, 1931, 1934, and 1950. Among a large number of writings, <span class="italic">Unemployed Struggles, 1919&#150;1936</span> (1936), <span class="italic">The Problem of the Distressed Areas</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Ten Lean Years</span> (1940), and his unfinished autobiography, <span class="italic">Never on our Knees</span> (1967), were important polemical documents of the inter-war years. In 1917 he married Polly Winifred, daughter of Edwin Stanley, a railway labourer. There was one daughter of the marriage.<br>
<br>Hannington died of a heart attack on 17 November 1966 at Hammersmith Hospital shortly after attending for a medical examination. He was survived by his wife.<br>
