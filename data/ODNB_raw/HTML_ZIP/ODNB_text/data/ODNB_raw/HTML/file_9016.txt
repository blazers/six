<span class="headword">Ewer,  John</span>  (1703&#150;1774), <span class="occ">bishop of Bangor</span>, was born at Belchamp St Paul, Essex, in March 1703 and baptized there on 16 March. He was the son of Edward Ewer, who came from a whig Hertfordshire family distantly connected with Lord Shaftesbury and the duke of Rutland, and his wife, Susannah. His brother, William, was governor of the Bank of England between 1781 and 1783. Ewer was educated at Eton College, where he was elected as a king's scholar in 1716, and proceeded to King's College, Cambridge, in 1723. He graduated BA in 1728, MA in 1732, and DD in 1756; he was elected to a fellowship in 1727 but in 1756 failed in a bid for the provostship as the duke of Newcastle's candidate. In June 1728 he returned briefly, as an assistant master, to Eton where he was tutor to the marquess of Granby. His reward for this service came in 1735 with his presentation to the living of Bottesford, the church being the closest to the Manners's seat at Belvoir Castle. He was ordained priest on 1 June 1735. In 1738 the duke of Rutland obtained a canonry of Winchester for Ewer, though Ewer's attempt to gain the income from the preceding vacancy in the canonry failed. In 1741 Ewer accompanied Lord Granby on the grand tour, which included Europe and Asia Minor. In September 1743 Ewer married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Barnardiston of Suffolk; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1751 Ewer was presented to the living of West Ilsley, Berkshire; later that year he was collated to the prebend of Moreton-cum-Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral. In January 1761 the duke of Rutland unsuccessfully sought the vacant bishopric of St David's for Ewer. However later that year Ewer was nominated to the see of Llandaff, though he may have delayed his consecration in the hope of a better appointment. He was consecrated at Lambeth on 13 September 1761 by Archbishop Thomas Secker and other bishops. He was permitted to retain his living of West Ilsley and his canonry of Windsor <i>in commendam</i>. In the absence of an episcopal residence at Llandaff he lived principally in Berkshire. Ewer's primary visitation at Llandaff was held in 1763 and a further visitation in 1768. It was during Ewer's episcopate that the cathedral choir was repaired. On 20 December 1769 he was translated to Bangor, where he held a visitation in 1771, taking care to send out visitation questions in English and in Welsh. He died on 28 October 1774 at his home near Worcester. He was survived by his wife and one of his daughters, Margaret Frances. Two years later his large library was sold in London.<br>
<br>Ewer's published sermons include those delivered on 12 March 1762, before the House of Lords, and on 10 April 1766, before the president and governors of the London Hospital at Whitechapel. His third published sermon, before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts at St Mary-le-Bow on 20 February 1767, sparked a major controversy; one historian has claimed that &#145;no Anglican prelate of the eighteenth century committed as great an indiscretion&#146;  (Bridenbaugh, 293). Ewer attacked the &#145;scandalous neglect&#146; of the American colonies by the government in denying them a resident episcopate. He also argued that the British had placed the American colonies under the great burden of having to travel to England for ordinations. Ewer was as firm in condemning the colonists for failing to use episcopally ordained ministers and claimed that this was contrary to the royal charter of those colonies. Bishop Warburton was to repeat Ewer's claims some months later. Ewer's sermon was attacked in the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>. The pamphlet war that followed, in both England and America, focused on whether Anglican episcopacy would be a benefit or a hindrance for American colonists. Those colonists who rejected Ewer's arguments included John Devotion, who termed them &#145;Llandaff's Whines&#146;, and William Livingstone, who viewed Ewer as a &#145;haughty prelate&#146;. The significance of Ewer's sermon was that it formed part of the growing unease at British policy towards the American colonies among the Anglican episcopate.<br>
