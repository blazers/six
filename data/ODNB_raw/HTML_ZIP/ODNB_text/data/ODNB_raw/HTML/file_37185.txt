<span class="headword">Berkeley,  Charles</span>, earl of Falmouth  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was baptized on 11 January 1630 at Bruton Abbey, Somerset, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66517/', "Charles Berkeley, second Baron Berkeley of Rathdowne, second Viscount Fitzhardinge of Berehaven (1599&#150;1668)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1689), daughter of Sir William Godolphin of Godolphin, Cornwall. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2224/', "William Berkeley (1639&#150;1666)")</script> was his younger brother. He was tutored by Hugh Cressy, the former chaplain of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, and Lucius Cary, second Viscount Falkland. During the civil wars his family was strongly royalist, and afterwards he was sent to serve the exiled Stuart court. In 1652 his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2217/', "Sir John (later first Baron) Berkeley")</script>, used his influence as governor to James, duke of York, to secure the youth a commission as a cavalry officer under the command of that prince. He remained in York's employment until the Restoration&#151;first in the French and then in the Spanish armies, where he saw considerable action&#151;and became his groom of the stole and one of his closest friends. In 1660 he returned to England with his master, who ensured him several honours from the newly restored Charles II. These included a knighthood, the post of lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth, and the receipts from mooring fees levied on the Thames below London Bridge. The latter provided him with the income needed to purchase a house beside the bowling green at Whitehall, and York also secured his election as MP for New Romney, Kent, in 1661. Nevertheless, his most nefarious recorded act was to claim that he had enjoyed the favours of York's new wife, Anne Hyde, in an effort to dissolve the marriage, which many considered a disaster, and to defame her father, Edward, the king's new chief minister. This attempt to &#145;protect&#146; his patron was, to say the least, both ill-considered and tactless, though seemingly had little effect on the favourite's relationship with either the king or his brother. The episode bears testimony to one who could be coarse in conversation, but Berkeley was to marry for love, as his own bride came from an impoverished royalist family. She was a famous beauty, Mary (1645&#150;1679), daughter of Colonel Hervey Bagot of Pipe Hayes, Warwickshire, whom he married on 18 December 1664.<br>
<br>At court Berkeley became associated with the faction led by George Digby, second earl of Bristol, and Sir Henry Bennet, and was friendly with the king's mistress, Barbara Villiers, countess of Castlemaine. In 1662 that faction became an important part of the government, and Berkeley received Bennet's post of keeper of the privy purse when the latter was promoted. But it was during the next year that observers noticed that King Charles himself had become so fond of Berkeley that he was now one of the principal royal favourites, and perhaps the greatest. In July 1663 he was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Berkeley of Rathdowne and Viscount Fitzhardinge of Berehaven and would have received an English title had the king not been conscious of hostility to his courtiers in the English House of Commons. However, in March 1665 he was granted the English titles Baron Botetourt of Langport and earl of Falmouth, as part of the honours bestowed when war was declared against the Dutch. The newly created earl volunteered for service in the royal fleet, and was killed by a cannon shot in the first battle, off Lowestoft on 3 June. On 22 June he was given a hero's funeral in Westminster Abbey, where he was buried. As his marriage had produced a single daughter, the earldom and his English barony became extinct; however, his father inherited his Irish titles by special remainder. Falmouth's widow married Charles Sackville, later sixth earl of Dorset and fourth earl of Middlesex, in 1674, and lived until 1679.<br>
<br>The king was more distressed by Falmouth's death than by that of any other person except his own sister, and it seems certain that the earl would have received further advancement had he lived. Even so, it may be doubted that he would have made a greater impact upon the course of history. No known portrait of him survives, and his character is almost as faintly recorded. He had no outstanding gifts, of intelligence, learning, or good looks, and was never employed for any important administrative, political, or diplomatic office. Instead he managed the privy purse, retained his post at Portsmouth, sat upon the committee for Tangier, and was sent upon polite diplomatic errands. He performed these minor tasks diligently, although he hated writing letters. He had no political aims and did not lead a faction, although he sought lesser posts for a few clients. If he had one trait of potential consequence it was his fondness for France, which led him to encourage efforts to ally with that country, but the international situation made these futile during his lifetime. His popularity with the royal brothers derived, indeed, from the fact that he was a devoted servant and affable companion who was content to further their wishes. His unpopularity with the more high principled of the English derived from the same qualities, for he indulged or encouraged what they considered to be the king's lechery and laziness. His prominence in his time and his lack of consequence for it both derive ultimately from his pleasant mediocrity.<br>
