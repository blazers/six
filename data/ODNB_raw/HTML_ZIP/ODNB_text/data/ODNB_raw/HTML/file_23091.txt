<span class="headword">Ramsay,  John</span>, earl of Holdernesse  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1626), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the second son of Sir Robert Ramsay of Wyliecleuch. He had at least six siblings, for four brothers and two sisters were named in his will, dated 6 January 1626, not long before his death. He first makes an appearance in the historical record in June 1599, when he was in the service of James VI and I, in somewhat unedifying circumstances. On the tenth of that month John Ramsay, one of the king's &#145;familiar serwands&#146;  (Pitcairn, 2.91&#150;3), was struck by one Patrick Myrtoun, one of the king's carvers, after a verbal quarrel in the king's own chamber at Falkland Palace in Fife. On the following day they encountered each other in the courtyard of the palace and once again exchanged heated words. Myrtoun drew his sword on Ramsay who responded in kind, but both were restrained by other royal servants and no blood was shed. Because these violent encounters took place while the king was in residence in the palace, the two were formally convicted of treason. They submitted themselves to the king's will and were pardoned and once more received into his favour.<br>
<br>The following year Ramsay more than redeemed himself and set his career at court on a firmly upward path. On 5 August 1600 he was in the company of the king when James was apparently lured to Perth by John Ruthven, third earl of Gowrie, son of William, the second earl, who had been executed in 1584. This was the so-called &#145;Gowrie conspiracy&#146;, the precise object and circumstances of which remain a mystery. The king was taken to Gowrie House, the Ruthvens' Perth residence, which he entered in the company of nobody else but the two Ruthven brothers. The official version, first given a public airing six days after the event, has it that soon afterwards James VI broke an upstairs window to call to his retinue for help because his life was threatened. The first person to arrive &#145;by the providence of God&#146; was &#145;his Majesteis peadge and trustie servand&#146;, John Ramsay  (Moysie, 142). He is said to have found the king tussling with Alexander Ruthven, the earl's younger brother, whom he killed. He then encountered the earl himself on the stairs and told him that the king had been killed. The earl, carrying two swords, put their points to the floor in what seems to have been a gesture of submission but he too was thereupon killed by Ramsay. Having thus apparently saved his sovereign's life Ramsay found almost instant favour from a grateful monarch. On 13 November that year he was knighted and given the lands of East Barns, near Dunbar in Haddingtonshire, the charter for which even narrated the details of the incident at Perth by way of an explanation for the gift.<br>
<br>After accompanying James VI to England in 1603 Ramsay spent most of the rest of his life at court. He did, however, maintain links with his homeland, and was appointed between 1610 and 1623 to various commissions for the peace for the constabulary of Haddington, where his principal Scottish lands lay. He was given further lands in England and a number of pensions from the English crown, as well as royal gifts to help him to settle his debts. On 11 June 1606 he was raised to the Scottish peerage with the title of Viscount Haddington and Lord Ramsay of Barns. To commemorate his deeds of 1600 he was allowed to incorporate within the coat of arms which he was granted a crown and a right arm holding a sword, at the point of which was a heart, and the motto <i>Haec dextra vindex principis et patriae</i> (&#145;This right arm saved the king and the nation&#146;).<br>
<br>On 20 February 1609 Haddington married Lady Elizabeth Ratcliffe (<i>d</i>. 1618), daughter of Robert, earl of Sussex. At the wedding celebrations the couple were honoured by the performance of a masque, specially written by Ben Jonson and performed by five English and twelve Scottish men of &#145;noble birth or high position&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 4.301). The marriage produced two sons, both of whom predeceased their father. On 28 August 1609 Haddington received a charter of the lands formerly belonging to the Cistercian abbey of Melrose, which were erected into a temporal lordship carrying the title Lord Ramsay of Melrose. In 1618, however, he resigned these lands with their title into the hands of Sir George Ramsay of Dalhousie, a kinsman.<br>
<br>Haddington certainly returned to Scotland in 1617, probably as part of the king's retinue on his only return visit to his kingdom after 1603. He must have stayed on after the king's journey back to England, for he served in November as one of the king's commissioners at the general assembly at St Andrews which rejected the liturgical reforms which would come to be known as the five articles of Perth. In 1619 he appears to have retired from court to France in protest at having been refused an English peerage, being passed over for the earldom of Montgomery. In 1621 he must have returned to favour, for on 22 January that year he was made baron of Kingston and earl of Holdernesse. With the title came the right to carry the English sword of state before the king every year on 5 August at the celebrations to mark the anniversary of his rescue of the king from the Gowrie conspiracy in 1600. His vote was counted at the notorious Scottish parliament of 1621 which approved the five articles of Perth, although he attended only by proxy.<br>
<br>Holdernesse's first wife having died in 1618, in July 1624 he married Martha Cockayne, daughter of Sir William Cockayne and sister of Charles, first Viscount Cullen. The marriage produced no children and she survived her husband, marrying Montagu Bertie, later second earl of Lindsey, in 1627. She died in July 1641. Holdernesse died in London in February 1626 and was, according to a request in his will, buried on 28 February in Westminster Abbey beside his sons James, who had died in 1618, and Charles, who had died in 1621. As he had no surviving children his titles died with him.<br>
