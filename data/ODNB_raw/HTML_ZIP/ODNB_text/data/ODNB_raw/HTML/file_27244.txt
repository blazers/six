<span class="headword">Thomas,  William</span>  (1613&#150;1689), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was born on 2 February 1613 at Bristol Bridge, Bristol, the son of John Thomas, a linen draper who had removed there from Carmarthen, and his wife, Elizabeth Blount. William Thomas claimed descent from Henry Fitzherbert, chamberlain to Henry I, and kinship to the lords Ferrers of Groby and Robert Ufford, earl of Suffolk (1238&#150;1269). More immediately, if more parochially, his grandfather, another William Thomas, was prominent in the civic life of Carmarthen, where he was alderman, mayor twice, and recorder by 1603. He is likely to have attended Lincoln's Inn from 1590, and certainly sat in parliament as member for Carmarthen Boroughs in 1614. He subsequently filled various local offices in and around Carmarthen, where his grandson William Thomas was first educated, at the grammar school under the auspices of Morgan Owen, later bishop of Llandaff. After matriculation at St John's College, Oxford, on 13 November 1629, Thomas graduated BA from Jesus College on 12 May 1632, and proceeded MA on 5 February 1635. He became a fellow of Jesus College. He may have received the degree of BCL from St John's on 9 July 1635, was ordained deacon at Oxford on 4 June 1637, and priest the following year. Shortly after this Thomas was presented to the living of Penbryn, Cardiganshire, and apparently became chaplain to Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland. Through Northumberland's interest he is said to have acquired the livings of Laugharne and Llansadyrnin in Carmarthenshire. The report that his appointment was contested is unsurprising, since the earl is not known to have had significant proprietorial interests in south Wales.<br>
<br>About this time Thomas married Blanch (<i>d</i>. 1677), daughter of Peter Samyne, a London merchant: the couple had four sons and four daughters. In 1644 Thomas was confronted by parliamentarian soldiers in Laugharne church, who threatened to shoot him if he persisted in reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and in praying for Queen Henrietta Maria, a Roman Catholic. The source of this story, a descendant of Thomas's, may embellish its subject's heroism, just as he himself after 1660 exaggerated his sufferings during the Commonwealth. This same source records that Thomas lost &pound;1500 through his sufferings down to 1660, and kept school at Laugharne as a way of augmenting his reduced income: he had been ejected from the living of Penbryn. Although he is reported as having been ejected also from Laugharne, Thomas was still there in 1657, and was well enough attuned to the regime of the protectorate to deliver an extremely learned sermon to the great sessions at Carmarthen on 16 March 1657, evidently at the invitation of the authorities. This sermon, typical of the genre of assize sermons, was framed as &#145;a caution for the client, the witness and the counsellor&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">The Regulating of Law-Suits</span>, title-page), and implied an orthodox and uncontroversial view of church&#150;state relations. It was published in London later that year.<br>
<br>In 1660 Thomas was one of many clergy who petitioned on 23 June for a restoration to their livings, citing his ejection from Penbryn. He was quickly successful in securing preferment, first as precentor of the remote and ruinous cathedral of St David's, on 4 August, and was installed there on the 28th of that month. On 2 August he was created DD at Oxford. Thomas was evidently well thought of by Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, who was influential in promoting him, on behalf of the crown, to the living of Llanbedr Felffre in Pembrokeshire in 1661. Through Clarendon he came to the attention of his grandest patron, James, duke of York, who selected him as one of his chaplains at a salary of &pound;50 per annum. Thomas is said to have accompanied James during a naval engagement with the Dutch, presumably in 1665. James and Clarendon advanced Thomas to become dean of Worcester, where he was installed on 25 November 1665. Thomas held the deanery <i>in commendam</i> with his post at St David's, and still retained the living of Laugharne. With or without the help of his powerful backers Thomas was evidently quickly able to befriend the dominant revanchist cavalier group in Worcestershire, notably Thomas, Lord Windsor, and Sir John Pakington of Westwood. These men formed a nascent tory interest, and Pakington was sufficiently taken with Dean Thomas to appoint him to his living of Hampton Lovett on 12 June 1670, upon which Thomas finally gave up Laugharne.<br>
<br>On 19 November 1677 Thomas was elected bishop of St David's, and was consecrated on 27 January following. With this promotion he was allowed still to hold the Worcester deanery <i>in commendam</i>, but he was evidently an active Welsh bishop. His fluency in the Welsh language, and west Wales family roots, provided him with a natural affinity with the gentry and clergy of his see, as did his interest in publishing religious texts in Welsh. Through his encouragement the third part of the works of Rhys Prichard (Vicar Prichard) had been published in 1672, and earned him a place as a dedicatee of the work; in 1671 and 1672 were published a new Welsh language <span class="roman">Bible</span> and book of <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and Thomas's influence has been detected in assisting their appearance. The ministers Stephen Hughes and Thomas Gouge were the principal movers in publishing these and the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> of 1677, but Thomas doubtless helped foster an environment in which these ventures could prosper. While at St David's he addressed the problems of dilapidation in his see; a start was made in rebuilding the palaces of Abergwili and Brecon. He attempted to move the cathedral services from St David's to the more populous and wealthy town of Carmarthen, but was unable to see through to completion either the rebuilding or the reorganization of the diocese.<br>
<br>On 14 December 1678 Thomas spoke in the House of Lords against the denunciation by Henry Whitaker, recorder of Shaftesbury and an MP in several parliaments, of most of the episcopate as papists. Thomas robustly asserted the protestantism of his colleagues, and was indeed regarded by Richard Baxter as among those bishops most sympathetic to nonconformity, or rather, least likely to persecute protestants excluded from the Church of England. He was in reality a classic defender of the claim by the Church of England to uniqueness. His book, <span class="italic">An Apology for the Church of England in Separation from it</span>, published in 1679, was, he explained to his archbishop, &#145;composed, rather huddled &hellip; in the eclipse of the Church of England, in a time of discomposure&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 146, fol. 121) during the 1650s.<br>
<br>Thomas was confirmed in his translation to the bishopric of Worcester on 27 August 1683. Ill health was by then beginning to take its toll on him, and accounted for his reluctance to travel to London. During his time at Worcester as bishop he gained a reputation for liberality towards the poor, who were fed daily at his door and twice weekly if they were in Worcester gaol. He enhanced the stock and accommodation of the cathedral library. In January 1684 he provided Archbishop Sancroft with an account of the Sunday morning service at Worcester Cathedral, where the congregation moved from the choir to the nave to hear the sermon because its numbers were augmented at sermon time by auditors from other churches. He assured Sancroft of his willingness to tackle irregularities among the cathedral clergy: &#145;I have not a fondness for any popularity&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 34, fol. 251). Thomas entertained his patron, now James II, at Worcester on 23 August 1687, when James was impressed by the lavish decoration laid on in his honour. But even on this ceremonial occasion tensions were evident between the Catholic king and the Anglican bishop. When Thomas offered to say grace the king substituted his own chaplain, &#145;upon which the good old man withdrew, not without tears in his eyes&#146;  (Nash, 2, appx, clxi). Thomas responded to James's suspension of the penal laws against nonconformists by declining to distribute the declaration of indulgence in his diocese, provoking James's displeasure, but the bishop was in outright opposition to the revolution of 1688. He refused to take the oath of allegiance, and his assertion to the dean of Worcester, George Hickes, that he would suffer at the stake rather than take the oath, provided encouragement to the nonjurors [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47712', "Nonjuring bishops")</script>]. Had he survived Thomas would surely have been removed from office, but he died at the bishop's palace on 25 June 1689, and was buried in the cloisters of Worcester Cathedral. Little of his estate of &pound;800 remained after debts and small legacies had been settled. &#145;He was of a stature somewhat tall and slender, of a long visage, his forehead large, his countenance graceful and his aspect venerable&#146;  (ibid., clxii). His grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27245/', "William Thomas")</script> was a noted antiquary who revised for publication <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Warwickshire</span> by Sir William Dugdale.<br>
