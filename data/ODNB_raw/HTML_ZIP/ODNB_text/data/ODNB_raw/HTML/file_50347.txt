<span class="headword">Bayeux,  Osbert  de</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1120&#150;1184), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and suspected murderer</span>, was a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27411/', "Archbishop Thurstan of York (d. 1140)")</script>. An archdeacon named Osbert occurs in the 1120s; if this was Osbert de Bayeux then he must have been promoted as archdeacon, presumably by his uncle, at an early age. As Osbert the archdeacon, nephew of Thurstan, he was mentioned in a charter of 1137&#150;40, his archdeaconry probably being that of Richmond. In 1140&#150;41, after Thurstan's death, along with Archdeacon Walter of London he opposed the election of William Fitzherbert, treasurer of York, as archbishop. In the years which followed, between 1142 and 1154, he witnessed several charters issued by lay persons, and after 1147 he attested <i>acta</i> of Fitzherbert's successful rival, Archbishop Henry Murdac. But in 1153 he secured first the deposition of Abbot Germanus of Selby, whose appointment had been obtained by Murdac, and then the reinstallation of Abbot Elias Paynel, who had resigned at Murdac's command. Shortly afterwards, however, Elias Paynel was deposed again, this time by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1161); Germanus was restored and Osbert was rebuked by the archbishop. The motives for his intervention at Selby are obscure, but they indicate that, despite his opposition to William Fitzherbert, Osbert did not feel any loyalty towards Murdac's candidate.<br>
<br>After the death of Henry Murdac, Osbert tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent Archbishop Fitzherbert's return, and, when the archbishop died after only a week in the city of York there were rumours of a poisoned chalice, and Osbert was accused of his murder. Charges were brought against the archdeacon by a chaplain of Archbishop Fitzherbert's named Symphorian, at a council presided over by King Stephen, probably at Michaelmas 1154. Osbert maintained that he was innocent and demanded trial by an ecclesiastical court. The death of Stephen prevented any immediate action, and after the accession of Henry II, Archbishop Theobald struggled to withdraw the case from royal into ecclesiastical jurisdiction. When the trial began in 1156 Symphorian failed to produce witnesses, but Osbert was not able to prove his innocence, and so the case was referred to the papal court. Osbert evidently appeared before both Adrian IV and Alexander III, but there is no record of any formal judgment. By 1158, however, Osbert had been replaced as archdeacon, and this suggests that in 1157 he was degraded and removed from office. In late 1154 Osbert had supported the election of Archbishop Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que (<i>d</i>. 1181), and evidence from a papal decretal of about 1175&#150;80 suggests that Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que had offered to grant the revenues of the precentorship of York to Osbert's son; this was a promise which, Osbert later claimed, the archbishop failed to fulfil.<br>
<br>After 1158 Osbert continued to style himself archdeacon, though now a minor secular lord. In 1166, as Osbert de Bayeux, archdeacon, he held half a knight's fee of the honour of Lacy, and lands by knight service of the honour of Skipton. Some time between 1159 and 1170 he was acting as steward of Hugh de Tilly, and over the years after his retirement he was a benefactor of various religious houses, Drax, Pontefract, and Guisborough, as well as of the knights templar and hospitaller. He may have married, and he had two sons who appear in the written records: William de Bayeux, son of Osbert the archdeacon, is located in Yorkshire in 1191 as one owing &pound;15 to Aaron the Jew of Lincoln; and Turstin de Baius, son of Osbert the archdeacon, attested a charter of Fountains Abbey dating from between about 1160 and 1180, which raises the possibility that he was born when Osbert still held the office of archdeacon. Osbert was still alive in 1184 when he witnessed a final concord at York. He is mentioned on an escheat roll of 1194, when Hugh Bardolf answered for 42<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. from the farm of Osbert the archdeacon in Bingley, but whether he was then still living is not clear. Osbert belonged in one sense to the world of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, to the era of the married, worldly cleric, and he contrasts sharply with a number of his colleagues in the York chapter who were drawn to and influenced by the wave of spirituality ushered in by the great age of the new monasticism.<br>
