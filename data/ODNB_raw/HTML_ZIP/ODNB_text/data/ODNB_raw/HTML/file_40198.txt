<span class="headword">Rubbra,  (Charles) Edmund Duncan</span>  (1901&#150;1986), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born on 23 May 1901 at 57 Cambridge Street, Northampton, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Edmund James Rubbra, journeyman shoe-last maker, clock and watch repairer, and, later, jeweller, and his wife, Mary Jane Bailey. The name Duncan was not on his birth certificate; it was the surname of his first wife and he used it after his first marriage. According to family tradition, the Rubbras originated from Bologna in Italy. He left school at fourteen and worked briefly as an errand boy and then a railway clerk. In his home there was a deep love of music and as a youngster he was much drawn to the music of Cyril Scott and Claude Debussy. Eventually he took lessons with Scott, and then went on to study composition at Reading University, where Gustav Holst taught, and counterpoint at the Royal College of Music with one of the great theorists of the day, R. O. Morris.<br>
<br>After leaving the college in 1925, Rubbra pursued a freelance career as a pianist, taking whatever teaching, performing, and journalistic work came to hand. His repertory included both Arnold Schoenberg and Aleksandr Skryabin, and he was a perceptive exponent of J. S. Bach. During the 1930s he attracted increasing attention with such works as the <span class="italic">Sinfonia concertante</span> for piano and orchestra (1934) and his first symphony (1937).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Rubbra served in the army, as an anti-aircraft gunner in the Royal Artillery and then in the army music unit, and made an appearance in battledress at London's Henry Wood Promenade Concerts to conduct the first performance of his fourth symphony (1942). Rubbra spent much of his army service entertaining the troops with the trio he had formed with Erich Gruenberg and William Pleeth (and was very fond of telling how the three were once introduced as being &#145;at the top of the tree in their various string combinations&#146;). The Rubbra&#150;Gruenberg&#150;Pleeth trio continued for some years after the war until the combined pressures of Rubbra's creative work and teaching led to its demise. In 1947 he was appointed lecturer in music at Oxford University, becoming a fellow of Worcester College in 1963. He remained at Oxford until 1968. In 1961 he also joined the staff of the Guildhall School of Music, where he taught composition until 1974.<br>
<br>Rubbra belonged to the same generation as Sir William Walton, Sir Lennox Berkeley, and Sir Michael Tippett but had little in common with them and even less with such European contemporaries as Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Dmitry Shostakovich. It has been said that his music was not of his time, yet could have been composed at no other. It is rooted in place&#151;England&#151;and, more specifically, England's musical heritage lies at its heart. There is little of the pastoral school in it, though Rubbra revered Ralph Vaughan Williams and also possessed a keen sense of nature's power, which is clearly evident in the fourth (1941&#150;2) and seventh symphonies (1957). Rubbra's outlook was far from insular: he set to music poetry ranging from the time of the Chinese Tang dynasty and of Icelandic ballads to medieval Latin and French verse, and his interest in eastern culture, which arose in childhood, remained lifelong. In <span class="italic">Counterpoint</span> (1960), Rubbra argued that western music had grown out of melody and in particular the interaction of independent melodic lines; this was certainly a dominant principle in his own music. Such was the eloquence and quality of his vocal music that some critics spoke of his symphonies as &#145;motets for orchestra&#146;. His choral music was finely fashioned and elevated in feeling, and his symphonies likewise were touched by a preoccupation with linear growth. Matter, not manner, was his central concern.<br>
<br>Rubbra's early symphonies are difficult, though not in the way that some contemporary music is, for the musical language itself is quite straightforward. There is nothing abstruse about the symphonies' tonality and harmony, which is basically diatonic, but they are difficult because the continuity of their melodic and polyphonic growth is logical and unremitting. The first two symphonies were composed in quick succession (both were finished in 1937) and it was obvious that, whatever their failings, Rubbra was a symphonist to be reckoned with. The third, which he finished in 1939, was a positive reaction to the experience of the second, and is outwardly the most genial and relaxed of the early symphonies. The orchestration is much cleaner and the first movement much closer to sonata form. The opening of the fourth symphony is beautiful and free from any kind of artifice, having serenity and quietude. This symphony, like the third, is not so dense contrapuntally as the first two, and though practically every idea evolves in some way or another out of the opening figure, its first movement is a sonata design. Nothing could be further removed from the grim years of the Second World War than this symphony. In 1948 came the fifth and most often played of the Rubbra symphonies; it enjoyed something of a vogue in the 1950s. Sir Adrian Boult gave the work its premi&egrave;re, Sir John Barbirolli recorded it, and Leopold Stokowski briefly included it in his repertory.<br>
<br>After the seventh symphony (1957), Rubbra's music fell on hard times and enjoyed relatively little exposure. His eighth symphony (1968) had to wait three years for a performance and the ninth (<span class="italic">Sinfonia sacra</span>, 1971&#150;2), for soloists, chorus, and orchestra, possibly his masterpiece, also suffered relative neglect. It tells the story of the resurrection, and with its soloists and chorus would closely resemble a passion were it not for its symphonic cohesion. Like most of Rubbra's finest music, it unfolds with a seeming inevitability and naturalness, and a powerful sense of purpose that justify its inclusion in the symphonic canon. His scoring has been criticized, but conductors such as Arturo Toscanini, Eugene Ormandy, and Neeme J&auml;rvi recorded his orchestration of Brahms's <span class="italic">Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Handel</span>.<br>
<br>Rubbra was of medium height and was for most of his adult life bearded. He possessed a beatific smile and exercised great personal charm. Always courteous, a supportive and illuminating teacher, he radiated warmth and spirituality. His deeply religious nature shines through much of his music: the canto movement of the sixth symphony (1954), for example, and the eighth, subtitled &#145;Hommage &agrave; Teilhard de Chardin&#146;. (Although he was much influenced by Buddhist teachings, Rubbra was received into the Catholic faith in 1947.) He never lost this feeling for organic growth essential to the symphony: his tenth (1974) and eleventh (1979) are highly concentrated one-movement affairs of much substance.<br>
<br>Rubbra's output was extensive and ran to over 160 works. Apart from the symphonies, his most important works included a viola concerto in A major, op. 75 (1952); a piano concerto in G major, op. 85 (1956); a violin concerto, op. 103 (1959); an improvisation for violin and orchestra, op. 89; four string quartets: F minor, op. 35 (1933, revised 1946), E[flat] op. 55 (1952), op. 112 (1962&#150;3), and op. 150 (1976&#150;7); two piano trios: op. 68 (1950) and op. 138 (1973); two violin sonatas: op. 31 (1931) and op. 133 (1967); and a cello sonata in G minor, op. 60 (1946). All of his symphonies have been commercially recorded, and there is an extensive discography which includes his two masses. His last work was the <span class="italic">Sinfonietta</span> for large string orchestra, op. 163, which he completed in 1980, in his late seventies, shortly before suffering a stroke, from which he eventually died.<br>
<br>Rubbra was appointed CBE in 1960. He became a member of the Royal Academy of Music in 1970 and a fellow of the Guildhall School of Music in 1968. He had honorary degrees from Leicester (LLD, 1959), Durham (DMus, 1949), and Reading (DLitt, 1978). His music does not possess the dramatic power which characterizes that of Vaughan Williams and Walton but has a sense of organic continuity that is both highly developed and immediately evident to the listener. Perhaps the most distinctive and individual quality that shines through his most inspired music, such as the opening of the seventh symphony or the <span class="italic">Missa in honorem sancti Dominici</span> (op. 66, 1948), is breadth and serenity.<br>
<br>Rubbra's first marriage, which lasted only a few months, was to Lilian Annie Duncan. There were no children. On 25 November 1933 he married the violinist Antoinette Chaplin (<i>b</i>. 1901/2), from France, daughter of William Chaplin, engineer; they had two sons. He separated from his second wife during the 1950s and in 1975, following her death, he married Colette Muriel Marian Yardley, daughter of Harold Evans, a Sunbeam Motors salesman. They had one son. Rubbra died on 14 February 1986 in Gerrards Cross, where his home was Lindens, Bull Lane.<br>
