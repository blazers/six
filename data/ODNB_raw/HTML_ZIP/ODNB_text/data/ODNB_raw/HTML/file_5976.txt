<span class="headword">Colman,  George, the elder</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1732, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre manager</span>, was born in Florence and baptized there at the church of San Giovanni on 18 April 1732, the son of Francis Colman (<i>bap</i>. 1691, <i>d</i>. 1733), envoy to the court of the grand duke of Tuscany, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gumley (<i>d</i>. 1767). His father, who is credited with the authorship of the <span class="italic">Opera Register</span>, adapted the libretto for Handel's <span class="italic">Arianna in Creta</span> (1734) and helped the composer re-engage the leading castrato Senesino for London. After her husband's death at Pisa on 20 April 1733 Mary Colman returned with her son to London, where a house was provided for her in St James's Park in which she lived until her death.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyliterarywork"></a>Education and early literary work</h2>George Colman's education was overseen by his shrewd and wealthy guardian William Pulteney, earl of Bath, who was the husband of Mary Colman's sister. George was sent to Westminster School, where Pulteney's son William was also a pupil. There he made many friends, including Charles Churchill, Robert Lloyd, Bonnell Thornton, and William Cowper, and had a successful academic career, entering Christ Church, Oxford, in 1751 as first among the Westminster king's scholars. In September 1753 his essay on literary criticism, &#145;A vision&#146;, was published anonymously in <span class="italic">The Adventurer</span> and January 1754 saw the first issue of <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span>. This weekly publication, consisting largely of polished, lively, pleasantly satirical essays, was produced jointly by Colman and Bonnell Thornton and ran to 140 issues before it closed in September 1756. The editors personalized themselves jointly as &#145;Mr Town&#146;, and wrote most of the articles, although there were contributions by William Cowper (with whom he formed the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71305', "Nonsense Club")</script>), Robert Lloyd, and others. Colman and Thornton also collaborated on a two-volume edition of work by female poets, <span class="italic">Poems by Eminent Ladies</span> (1755). Pulteney was determined that his nephew should distinguish himself in the law and in May 1755 Colman entered Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar in January 1757 and between 1758 and 1761 he worked on the Oxford circuit. His autobiographical poem &#145;The law student&#146;, written in 1757, depicts family pressures upon him, with his aunt insisting &#145;Turn Parson, Colman! That's the way to thrive&#146; and his uncle crying &#145;stick close; close, Coley, to the Bar!&#146;. However, &#145;the brisk heir to forty thousand pound&#146; was disinclined to legal labours and attracted to the world of literature and the London theatre  (Colman, <span class="italic">Prose</span>, 2.285&#150;7).<h2>
<a name="DavidGarrickandDruryLane"></a>David Garrick and Drury Lane</h2>In May 1757 Colman published and sent to David Garrick a pamphlet in the actor's praise, ironically entitled <span class="italic">A Letter of Abuse, to D&#151;d G&#151;k, Esq.</span> This led to his friendship with Garrick, who encouraged Colman and staged his comic afterpiece <span class="italic">Polly Honeycombe</span> at Drury Lane on 5 December 1760. The piece, which makes fun of sentimental novels and their female readers, had a shaky first night but recovered to achieve fifteen performances during the season and frequent later revivals. It appeared anonymously and was generally attributed to Garrick himself until on 12 December, at a performance specially requested by the king, the actor&#150;manager added lines to the prologue declaring it was by &#145;a young Beginner&#146; not &#145;a batter'd sinner&#146;  (Danchin, 771). Colman's pamphlet <span class="italic">Critical Reflections on the Old English Dramatick Writers</span>, addressed to Garrick, appeared in January 1761. Garrick helped Colman to prune his comedy <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, which was premi&egrave;red at Drury Lane on 12 February with the leading roles played by Hannah Pritchard, Kitty Clive, and Garrick himself. Hopkins, the company's prompter, noted that it &#145;met with greater applause than anything since the <span class="italic">Suspicious Husband</span>&#146;  (Stone, 843) and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 31, 1761, 54) found it a comedy with &#145;few equals, and no superior&#146;. It held the stage for the rest of the century and beyond.<br>
<br>Charles Churchill's satire <span class="italic">The Rosciad</span> (March 1761), which praised Garrick, Colman, and Thornton while attacking many theatrical personalities of the day, gave rise to vicious attacks on Colman and his associates by the playwright Arthur Murphy and others. As a result &#145;much good writing and much wit and humour were thrown away in this very acrimonious and disgraceful controversy&#146;  (Baker, 1.136). In April 1761 Colman and Thornton, with the support of Garrick, began publication of the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>. The paper appeared three times a week and contained literary and theatrical gossip, anecdotes, and entertaining articles. In addition to many smaller items, Colman contributed fifteen longer papers, signed &#145;Genius&#146;, between June 1761 and January 1762. The issue for 20 June consists of his &#145;Portrait of the author, and description of his person&#146;, a comic dissertation on his lack of height:<blockquote>As I walk along the street, I hear the men and women say to one another, <i>there goes a little man!</i>&#151;In a word, it is my irreparable misfortune to be, without my shoes, little more than five feet in height. (Colman, <span class="italic">Prose</span>, 1.22&#150;3)</blockquote>Colman's comic afterpiece <span class="italic">The Musical Lady</span> was premi&egrave;red on 6 March 1762. It ridiculed the fashion for Italian music and Jane Pope played the affected heroine, as she had done so successfully in <span class="italic">Polly Honeycombe</span>.<br>
<br>Colman had now abandoned the law and his identification with the world of the theatre was strengthened by his liaison with Sarah Ford (<i>d</i>. 1771), the mother of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5977/', "George Colman")</script>, who was born on 21 October 1762. Sarah had been seduced by the actor Henry Mossop, who deserted her and their daughter Harriet when he moved to Ireland in autumn 1759. Colman became her protector, treating Harriet as his own child. In September 1763 Garrick, who was exhausted by the strain of acting and managing the Drury Lane company and depressed by the theatre riots that January, left England for an extended continental holiday. He did not return to London until April 1765 and in his absence the theatre was managed by his brother George, James Lacy, and Colman. William Powell, who had been coached by Garrick, made a successful stage d&eacute;but at Drury Lane in October 1763 in the title role of an adaptation by Colman of Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Philaster</span>. A month later came the premi&egrave;re of Colman's comic afterpiece <span class="italic">The Deuce is in him</span>, which was received with cries of bravo. A version of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (23 November 1763), with the fifth act cut and many songs added, was Colman's first theatrical failure. Hopkins commented: &#145;The Performers first Sung the Audience to Sleep, &amp; then went to Sleep themselves&#146;  (Stone, 1021). Colman, who had taken considerable trouble over the production, pruned it ruthlessly into an afterpiece, <span class="italic">The Fairy Tale</span>, which was performed only three nights later with considerable success. The fairies were played by children, with the nine-year-old Harriet Ford as Titania.<br>
<br>Colman's cousin William, the only surviving child of the earl of Bath, died in February 1763 and it was generally expected that Colman, who had been treated as &#145;his second son&#146;  (Colman, <span class="italic">Some Particulars</span>, 5), would inherit the earl's fortune. However, when Bath died in July 1764 he provided Colman with an annuity of 900 guineas but left his estate to his childless brother, General Henry Pulteney. Colman wrote no new plays or adaptations for Drury Lane during the second season of Garrick's absence but continued to be active in the management. <span class="italic">The Comedies of Terence</span>, his translation of six plays into blank verse, with an introductory essay and commentaries, was published in 1765 to critical acclaim.<br>
<br>Before Garrick's departure for the continent, he and Colman had begun writing a comedy together and work on this was resumed when Garrick returned to London in 1765. Letters and drafts of <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> show that there were joint discussions on all parts of the play and that it was very carefully designed for the acting skills and personalities of the Drury Lane company. The friends quarrelled when Garrick, who wished to withdraw from the creation of new roles, refused to play the part of the elderly fop Ogleby which had been designed for him, and there were then arguments about their respective shares in the work. However, they were on friendly terms again by Christmas 1765. In the first edition of the play text (1766) the work was jointly acknowledged, and the &#145;Advertisement&#146; to the play in Colman's <span class="italic">Dramatick Works</span> (1777) states: &#145;Some friends, and some enemies, have endeavoured to allot distinct portions of this play to each of the Authors. Each, however, considers himself as responsible for the whole&#146;  (1.152). <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> was premi&egrave;red on 20 February 1766, with a superlative cast led by Thomas King as Ogleby and Kitty Clive as Mrs Heidelberg, and enjoyed an unbroken run of thirteen nights. The mixture of sentiment and satire, the humour of the situations, and the opportunities offered to its actors have kept the play in the theatrical repertory to the present day. It was soon translated into French and German and an operatic version, Cimarosa's <span class="italic">Il matrimonio segreto</span>, premi&egrave;red in Vienna in 1792, has also enjoyed lasting success. Garrick wanted Colman to work with him on an adaptation of Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>, but Colman was feeling unwell and went to Paris to recuperate, taking Sarah Ford and Harriet. Garrick wrote cheerfully to him about meetings with little George and the progress of Colman's villa, Bath House, which was being built at Richmond. A new piece by Colman, <span class="italic">The English Merchant</span>, a five-act comedy based on Voltaire's <span class="italic">L'&Eacute;cossaise</span>, was produced at Drury Lane in February 1767. More sentimental and moral than Colman's earlier plays, it enjoyed some success, largely because of the character of the plain-spoken, benevolent English merchant, Freeport, created by Richard Yates.<h2>
<a name="CoventGardenpatentee"></a>Covent Garden patentee</h2>While Garrick ruled at Drury Lane, London's other patent theatre, Covent Garden, was managed by John Rich until his death in 1761 and then by his son-in-law, the tenor John Beard. By 1767 Beard's increasing deafness made him wish to retire from the theatre and the patent was made available for purchase at &pound;60,000. Two wealthy young businessmen, Thomas Harris and John Rutherford, invited the actor William Powell and Colman to join them in running the theatre. With the help of a legacy of &pound;6000 from his mother, who died in May 1767, Colman raised &pound;15,000 for his share of the patent. He still had hopes that he would finally inherit the Bath fortune, but when General Pulteney died in October 1767 he bequeathed the bulk of the estate to a distant relative and left Colman an annuity of &pound;400. Although Colman later claimed that Pulteney had accepted his acquisition of the share in the patent, it is almost certain that it was his involvement with the theatre and his refusal to give up Sarah Ford which alienated the general. Colman married Sarah on 12 July 1768 at St John, Horsleydown, Bermondsey.<br>
<br>The contract between the new Covent Garden patentees was carelessly drawn up, Colman's actions being subject to veto by Harris and Rutherford, who had no practical knowledge of the theatre. They soon had mistresses in the company and problems started when they demanded preferential treatment for their favourites. They accused Colman of assuming excessive powers, the quarrel became public, and a pamphlet war about the dispute was waged throughout 1768. Despite the disarray, Covent Garden had a successful and profitable first season under the new management, with the actors responding well to Colman's direction. Rutherford sold his share in the patent to Henry Dagge and James Leake in summer 1768, and they joined Harris in a lawsuit against Colman which reached chancery in July 1770, when judgment was given in Colman's favour. By this time passions were cooling, for Covent Garden under Colman was consistently profitable. In November 1771 the managers &#145;met together without the interposition of any other persons, shook hands, dined at Mr. Colman's, and put a final stop to all the proceedings at law&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 41, 1771, 520). Harris matured into a very competent manager who was to remain at Covent Garden until his death in 1820.<br>
<br>The strength of Covent Garden under Rich and Beard had been in music and spectacle, so Colman set out to reinforce the acting company. He engaged Richard Yates and his wife, persuaded Charles Macklin to give his famous interpretation of Shylock, and gave William Powell six leading Shakespearian roles in the first season. He produced his own short farce <span class="italic">The Oxonian in Town</span> in November 1767, while February 1768 saw his adaptation of <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, which was nearer to Shakespeare than the version generally in use but retained a happy ending and omitted the Fool. Powell's sudden death at Bristol in July 1769 was a serious blow. Colman wrote a prologue for the benefit performance for Powell's family at the Bristol Theatre and an epitaph for Powell's tomb in Bristol Cathedral. The actor's widow took over his share in the patent and was co-defendant with Colman in the case brought by the other patentees. Colman's contribution to the theatre as a dramatist in the 1769&#150;70 season was his comedy <span class="italic">Man and Wife, or, The Shakespeare Jubilee</span> (7 October 1769), which capitalized quickly on Garrick's rain-soaked celebrations at Stratford that September. The play incorporated a pageant of characters from seventeen of Shakespeare's plays, accompanied by appropriate music.<br>
<br>The following season Colman wrote two successful afterpieces, the burletta <span class="italic">The Portrait</span> (22 November 1770) and the pantomime <span class="italic">Mother Shipton</span> (26 December 1770), both with music by Samuel Arnold. Thomas Augustine Arne became musical director in 1771 and provided music for Colman's masque <span class="italic">The Fairy Prince</span> (12 November 1771), which was based on Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Oberon</span>. Colman made a two-act version of <span class="italic">Comus</span> (17 October 1772) for which Arne had written music many years before and Arne provided new music for two other Colman adaptations, <span class="italic">Elfrida</span> (21 November 1772), from a &#145;dramatic poem&#146; by William Mason, and <span class="italic">Achilles in Petticoats</span> (16 December 1773), from John Gay's ballad opera <span class="italic">Achilles</span>. However, the most important theatrical event of these years for English theatre was the premi&egrave;re of Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (15 March 1773), put on by Colman without any great hopes of success after Garrick had procrastinated over its production.<br>
<br>Sarah Colman died suddenly on 29 March 1771 after taking the wrong medicine for an illness from which she was recovering. Fanny Burney wrote in her diary:<blockquote>In point of understanding she was infinitely inferiour to M<sup>r</sup> Colman, but she possessed an uncommon sweetness of Temper, much sensibility, &amp; a generous &amp; restless desire of obliging, &amp; of making her friends happy. So amiable a Character must, I am sure, endear her infinitely to M<sup>r</sup> Colman, of whom she, with the greatest reason, was beyond expression attached to. He is one of the best Tempered, (though I believe very passionate) of men, lively, agreeable, open Hearted, &amp; clever. (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters</span>, 1.144)</blockquote>Colman made the sixteen-year-old Harriet, whom Fanny Burney thought genteel and very well educated, the mistress of his household until she married in 1777. On 30 November 1771 Colman was &#145;suddenly seized with a fit&#146; at the theatre  (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>, 30 Nov&#150;3 Dec 1771) and was forced to rest for several weeks. Personal tragedy and the strain of managing Covent Garden were taking their toll. The 1773&#150;4 season was full of problems, particularly with the elderly and cantankerous actor Charles Macklin. Colman's sentimental comedy <span class="italic">The Man of Business</span> (29 January 1774) managed fourteen performances but was never revived. At the end of the season he sold his share in the patent to the actor Thomas Hull for &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>Colman spent six months recuperating in Bath before returning to London. In the summer of 1775 he took his twelve-year-old son on an extended holiday tour, showing him his future Oxford college and travelling north to Yorkshire and Durham. Colman was soon writing again. He contributed a prologue to Garrick's farce <span class="italic">Bon Ton</span>, began a translation of Horace's <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span>, which he published eight years later, and contributed six essays entitled &#145;The gentleman&#146; to the <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, a paper in which he had a share. Garrick staged Colman's adaptation of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Epicoene, or, The Silent Woman</span> in January 1776, and his satiric farce <span class="italic">The Spleen, or, Islington Spa</span> that March, but neither proved a success. At the end of the season Garrick retired from the stage. He had hopes that Colman would purchase his share of the Drury Lane patent, but his friend was unwilling to venture again into management where he could not have sole control. Colman wrote <span class="italic">New Brooms! An Occasional Prelude</span> for the first night under the new management, led by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and the following May he wrote the epilogue for <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> while Garrick provided the prologue.<h2>
<a name="ManagementoftheHaymarketTheatre"></a>Management of the Haymarket Theatre</h2>In 1776 Samuel Foote, the comic actor and dramatist who had run the Little Theatre in the Haymarket for fifteen years, wished to retire. Foote had been granted a patent to run summer seasons at his theatre, and Colman agreed to make him a guaranteed payment of &pound;1600 a year for life in return for the theatre and the use of the patent. He also paid &pound;500 for the rights to Foote's plays. When Foote died, in October 1777, after receiving only one half-year payment of &pound;800, the patent became invalid and Colman had to apply annually for a licence for his summer season. It was at the Haymarket that Colman's abilities as a manager had the greatest effect on the capital's theatrical life. For the first time London had theatrical performances on almost every night between late May and mid-September. Colman brought forward talented actors and singers, promoted new dramatists, including Mrs Inchbald and other women writers, and attracted a wider and more discriminating audience than had previously attended the theatre during the unfashionable summer months.<br>
<br>The new manager immediately extended the repertory at the Haymarket, strengthened the acting company, and improved production standards. He encouraged the comedian John Edwin, who had been in Foote's company for a year, and introduced the young Elizabeth Farren from Liverpool. John Henderson was brought from Bath to play Shylock, Hamlet, Falstaff, and Richard III in the first season. After a performance of <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> followed by the musical afterpiece <span class="italic">Midas</span>, the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (10 June 1777) noted &#145;All the business of the stage perfect, all the little parts smoothly given, and the whole rather superior than inferior to a performance at either of the Winter Theatres!&#146; 1777 also saw the premi&egrave;re of John Gay's ballad opera <span class="italic">Polly</span>, banned by the lord chamberlain in December 1728, and of <span class="italic">The Spanish Barber</span>, Colman's very popular adaptation of Beaumarchais's <span class="italic">Le barbier de S&eacute;ville</span>. Samuel Arnold became the Haymarket's musical director and continued to work for the Colmans, father and son, until his death in 1802. Colman wrote two original plays for later seasons, an interesting satiric comedy, <span class="italic">The Suicide</span> (1778), for which Garrick provided the epilogue, and a comedy of modern manners, <span class="italic">The Separate Maintenance</span> (1779). In 1778 Colman brought out a ten-volume edition of the dramatic works of Beaumont and Fletcher with critical and explanatory notes and that summer he staged his adaptation of Fletcher's <span class="italic">Bonduca</span>, using Henry Purcell's music. Colman's adaptation of George Lillo's tragedy <span class="italic">The Fatal Curiosity</span> was surprisingly popular in 1782 and the following year he revived <span class="italic">The Fox</span>, his version of Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> made for Covent Garden in 1771.<br>
<br>Colman's lighter pieces included <span class="italic">The Manager in Distress</span> (30 May 1780), a short theatrical satire where he portrayed himself as the playhouse manager &#145;little Dapperwit&#146;. In <span class="italic">The Election of the Managers</span> (2 June 1784), another one-act piece designed to open the evening's entertainment, the Haymarket's manager was &#145;little Bayes&#146;, but its amusing parallels with the recent Westminster election, where the duchess of Devonshire reputedly bought votes with kisses, led to trouble with the censor and a section of the audience. Colman's <span class="italic">The Genius of Nonsense</span> was advertised as &#145;An Original, Whimsical, Operatical, Pantomimical, Farcical, Electrical, Naval, Military, Temporary, Local Extravaganza. The Overture and new Musick by Dr. Arnold&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 4 Sept 1780). This expos&eacute; of the quack doctor James Graham and his Temple of Health starred the lovely and notorious Ann Cargill as the Goddess of Health and Genius of Nonsense. The following season she played the highwayman Macheath in Colman's travesty production, <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera Reversed</span>, with Edwin as Lucy and Charles Bannister singing in his natural bass voice as an incomparable Polly. Colman framed it with <span class="italic">A Preludio</span> and <span class="italic">Medea and Jason</span>, satirizing Italian opera and the opera ballet. Charles Bannister was one of the Haymarket's most popular performers and Colman nurtured the careers of Bannister's son John and of the sopranos Elizabeth Harper and Georgina George. Colman's pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Teague, or, The Giant's Causeway</span>, written jointly with John O'Keeffe, was premi&egrave;red in 1782. He commissioned a number of comic operas from O'Keeffe and Arnold including <span class="italic">The Son-in-Law</span> (1779), <span class="italic">The Agreeable Surprise</span> (1781), and <span class="italic">Peeping Tom</span> (1784), which filled the theatre season after season.<br>
<br>In December 1784 Colman went to Bath to take the waters as a cure for his gout. The following September he chose Margate and sea-bathing after the exertions of the summer, but he had a stroke there in early October which left him partially paralysed. He recovered to some extent, but was increasingly prone to epileptic attacks. Nevertheless he continued with the Haymarket seasons supported by his son, who tried to &#145;assist him, without appearing to do so,&#151;for he was extremely jealous of the least interference in his concerns&#146;  (<span class="italic">Random Records</span>, 2.304). <span class="italic">Tit for Tat</span>, Colman's adaptation of Joseph Atkinson's comedy <span class="italic">The Mutual Deception</span>, was produced in 1786. The next season saw the premi&egrave;re of George Colman the younger's popular success <span class="italic">Inkle and Yarico</span> and his father's farce <span class="italic">The Village Lawyer</span>, based on De Brueys's <span class="italic">L'avocat patelin</span> and written for Edwin's benefit. In the same year Colman published <span class="italic">Prose on Several Occasions, Accompanied with some Pieces in Verse</span>, a three-volume collected edition of his essays, criticism, occasional verse, and theatrical prologues and epilogues. He also prepared the pamphlet <span class="italic">Some Particulars of the Life of the Late George Colman, Esq.</span> which he left for publication after his death, giving proof that he was not the illegitimate son of the earl of Bath, a rumour which had dogged him throughout his life, and denying that he had knowingly forfeited the Bath inheritance by purchasing a share in the Covent Garden patent.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Colman made a new will in April 1789, ignoring the fact that he was seriously in debt. He left his theatre and literary property to his son but made very generous provision for Sophia Croker, the wife of an army officer, whom the younger George described as &#145;a kept Mistress or Common Prostitute&#146;  (Vincent, 39). By 1784 she was living with Colman at his house in Gower Street and in 1788 she persuaded him to give her the house and its furnishings. Colman's final stage work, <span class="italic">Ut pictura poesis!</span>, an afterpiece based on Hogarth's <span class="italic">The Enraged Musician</span>, opened the 1789 season, but by then he was incapable of the proper management of the theatre or his own finances. On 18 June he suffered a fit which left him mentally deranged and in November he was declared lunatic. His son arranged for him to be well cared for in the house of Mrs Ann Clarkson in &#145;a healthful and airy situation&#146; in Paddington, and paid the wages of a keeper, a manservant, and a maid to look after him  (Vincent, 47). Colman experienced some comparatively lucid intervals but &#145;his mind &hellip; was, in the last stages of his malady, fill'd, like a cabalistick book, with delusions, and crowded with the wildest flights of morbid fancy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Random Records</span>, 2.287). He died at Paddington on 14 August 1794, and was buried at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, ten days later.<br>
<br>George Colman the elder is chiefly remembered today as co-author of <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>. His lesser dramatic works gave much pleasure in their day and frequently served a genuine satiric purpose. Despite his poor health he was a man of considerable energy, and the range and quality of his essays, journalism, translations, and criticism remain impressive. A member of the Beefsteak Club and Dr Johnson's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/49211', "Club")</script>, he enjoyed the friendship of the leading writers, artists, and wits of his day. Above all, he was one of the finest theatre managers of the century, the great little manager.<br>
