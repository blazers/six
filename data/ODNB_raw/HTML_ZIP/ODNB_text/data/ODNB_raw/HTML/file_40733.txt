<span class="headword">Grenfell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fane]</span>,  Ethel Anne Priscilla <span class="st"> [Ettie]</span></span>, Lady Desborough  (1867&#150;1952), <span class="occ">hostess</span>, was born on 27 June 1867, the daughter and only surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9138/', "Julian Fane (1827&#150;1870)")</script>, diplomatist, and fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9137/', "John Fane, eleventh earl of Westmorland (1784&#150;1859)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Adine (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of the sixth Earl Cowper. Both her parents died before she was three, and she used to say that until she was five she never wore anything but black. She was brought up at Panshanger, Hertfordshire, and was heir to that estate of 30,000 acres and a fine collection of pictures. She grew up to be outstandingly pretty, and had numerous admirers, but she chose solid worth in the shape of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33566/', "William Henry (Willy) Grenfell (1855&#150;1945)")</script> of Taplow Court, Buckinghamshire, athlete and public servant, whom she married on 17 February 1887; he was created Baron Desborough in 1905. She was an extra woman of the bedchamber to Queen Mary from 1912.<br>
<br>Ettie Grenfell was notable in three different roles: as a mother, as a brilliant hostess, and as mistress (perhaps platonic) to a series of devoted men. She had five much-loved children (Julian, Billy, Monica, Ivo, and Imogen), in whose lives she played a big part. As a young man <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33564/', "Julian Grenfell")</script>, who was an uncomfortable mixture of athlete and poet, rebelled against her worldly lifestyle, but he still wrote to her: &#145;I don't want to see you again ever because everyone after you is like flat soda water&#146;  (Desborough, 186).<br>
<br>Ettie Grenfell was a leading member of the group of politically minded intellectuals known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script>, whom she entertained at her famous Saturday to Monday parties at Taplow Court. Arthur Balfour, the central figure, was one of her greatest friends. Osbert Sitwell called her the last of the great whig hostesses and certainly, descended as she was from Lady Melbourne and Lady Palmerston, she was bred for the part; she also looked the part, like a Gainsborough picture, and she talked in the Holland House drawl. She had an insatiable interest in human beings: Sitwell described how every guest when he left Taplow believed he was the only person she had wished to talk to, and not only that, but also that his presence had been the very making of the party. Lord David Cecil described how, seated between the prime minister and a fifteen-year-old schoolboy&#151;himself&#151;she lavished her attention and charm equally on both. Max Beerbohm in his skit on Taplow in <span class="italic">The Seven Men</span> added a barb: &#145;exclusive she was but not of publicity. Next to Windsor Castle [Taplow] was the most advertised house in England&#146;  (M. Beerbohm, <span class="italic">The Seven Men</span>, 1919, 62).<br>
<br>Perhaps due to her traumatic childhood with its many bereavements, Ettie Grenfell had a hunger for admiration, and, not satisfied with the dog-like devotion of her husband&#151;whom she loved none the less&#151;she embarked on a series of long-drawn-out love affairs. The first was with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37052/', "George Wyndham (1863&#150;1913)")</script>; he was succeeded by Evan Charteris (1864&#150;1940) and by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37152/', "John Baring, later second Baron Revelstoke (1863&#150;1929)")</script>, who was hers for life. Maurice Baring, the novelist, was also enamoured of her and portrays her as Leila, the vamp in <span class="italic">C</span> (1924). As she grew older she favoured younger men such as Archie Gordon, who was engaged to Violet Asquith. He was killed in a car crash in 1909. &#145;Ettie is an ox&#146;, commented Margot Asquith, &#145;she will be made into Bovril when she dies&#146;  (Desborough, 185).<br>
<br>Lady Desborough was soon to need all her toughness. From the outbreak of the 1914 war her two elder sons, Julian and Billy, fought gallantly in France, but in 1915 both of them were killed. To staunch her grief, and as a memorial to her sons, she told the story of their lives, mainly from their letters, in <span class="italic">Pages from a Family Journal</span>, published privately in 1916. It is a touching yet unsentimental work. Her elder daughter, Monica, also served in the war, as a Red Cross nurse in France. Her youngest son, Ivo, died in a car accident in 1926.<br>
<br>Between the wars the Desboroughs continued to live in their two great houses, Taplow and Panshanger, giving weekend parties for Arthur Balfour and the thinning ranks of the Souls. Willy died in 1945; an old friend described Ettie in her last years as &#145;a lady of great age, lying half paralysed in a huge empty house and saying with the heart rending ghost of a gay smile: &#147;we did have fun didn't we?&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 May 1952). She died at Panshanger on 28 May 1952; the funeral was at Hertingfordbury and the burial at Taplow on 1 June.<br>
