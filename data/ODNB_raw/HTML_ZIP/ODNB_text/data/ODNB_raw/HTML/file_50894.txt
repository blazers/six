<span class="headword">Scal&eacute;,  (Peter) Bernard</span>  (1739/40&#150;1826), <span class="occ">cartographer and surveyor</span>, was born in 1739, or perhaps early in 1740, in London, possibly in Bermondsey, the son of Bernard Scal&eacute; (1672/3&#150;1744), whose occupation is unknown, and grandson of Bernard Scal&eacute;, a protestant pastor from Languedoc, who fled France, and whose descendants were active members of the Huguenot communities in London, Dublin, and Colchester. Scal&eacute; had at least one sister, Mary Ann (or Mary Anne). Their father died in poverty in 1744, but they were provided for by their wealthy and childless uncle, Peter Scal&eacute; (<i>b</i>. 1668/1671), who was born in France, served as a soldier in Colonel Theodore Vesey's regiment of foot in Ireland between 1715 and 1717, and settled in Colchester, styling himself gentleman. His Irish and Essex connections may have lain behind both siblings' subsequent connections with those areas.<br>
<br>Little is known of Scal&eacute;'s life before, in the 1750s, he was taken as a pupil by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37907/', "John Rocque")</script>, a cartographer of Huguenot descent, who in 1751 had married Scal&eacute;'s sister, Mary Ann, by then already the widow of Edward Bew, a druggist. Rocque was at this time trading from Dublin, and there Scal&eacute; learned skills from him for his later career as a land surveyor, cartographer, and land agent. Rocque founded the &#145;French school&#146; of land surveying in Dublin, and Scal&eacute; was his most distinguished follower. He eclipsed his master in the artistic quality of his work, while matching his high technical standards, but was neither so prolific nor so influential, his work being largely confined to Ireland (where he is known to have worked in seventeen counties) and to Essex and Sussex in England. His striking hallmark was to treat the cartouche and legend as if they were on separate torn pieces of paper. His penmanship and use of colour were unusually fine, and he exhibited landscapes to societies of artists in Dublin and London.<br>
<br>In September 1758 Scal&eacute; set up in business in Dublin as &#145;P. Bernard Scalle&#146; who would survey &#145;Counties, Cities, gentlemen's estates etc., after the manner of Mr John Rocque, his brother-in-law by whom he was instructed&#146; (<span class="italic">Sleator's Public Gazetteer</span>, 1758, cited in Mason and Bensusan-Butt, 510). He retained a business in Dublin until 1779, trading from various addresses, but most enduringly at Lower Abbey Street from 1767 to 1777. Notable works during these years were his survey of Trinity College, Dublin (1761, TCD) and, with former pupil William Richards (<i>d</i>. 1766), a curious map of Ireland for a watch-case (1762); two fine plans of the city and environs of Waterford (1764); and, using a &#145;marine theodolite&#146; invented by Richards, <span class="italic">Directions for Navigating into the Bay of Dublin from Wicklow Head, and from Balbriggen</span> (1765), with charts. The <span class="italic">Directions</span> were supported by subscribers, mostly Dubliners, and including some Huguenots, and passed a stiff instrumental test devised by the Dublin committee of merchants.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1765 Scal&eacute; married Henrietta Letch (<i>d</i>. 1824) in Dedham, Essex. Henrietta was related to several influential Huguenot families, including the Debonnaires of Colchester. She returned with Scal&eacute; to Ireland. Their children were William Bernard (1766&#150;1769), Henrietta Ann (1767&#150;1850), Bernard (<i>b</i>. 1770), Julia (1771&#150;1772), Charlotte (1772&#150;1773), Morley (<i>b</i>. 1773, <i>d</i>. 1773), and Margaret Sophia (<i>m</i>. 1807).<br>
<br>After the death of Richards in 1766 estate surveying became Scal&eacute;'s main preoccupation. Notable works from this period were his atlas of the manor of Ardglass, co. Down (1768) and the <span class="italic">Tables for the Easy Valuing of Estates</span> (1771), which was dedicated to James Fitzgerald, first duke of Leinster, for whom Scal&eacute; surveyed in 1771. He often produced one finely coloured and decorated display map in the French tradition and a plainer map for daily use in the Irish tradition. Apart from estate maps he issued revisions of Rocque's plans of Dublin in 1773 and 1787 and produced the thirty-seven elegant county maps of <span class="italic">An Hibernian Atlas</span> (1776) which was commercially successful but not technically or artistically innovative.<br>
<br>In 1774 Scal&eacute; and his family moved to Mangroves, a house near Great Warley, near Brentford, Essex. Scal&eacute; kept his Irish business interest, being in partnership in Dublin from 1774 to 1778 with his former pupils John Brownrigg (1748/9&#150;1838) and Thomas Sherrard (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1837). With them he surveyed the estates of Trinity College, Dublin (1775, TCD) and he continued some Irish surveying by himself, in 1774 mapping the Irish estates of the duke of Devonshire, and in 1782 surveying the Irish estates of Viscount Midleton.<br>
<br>Scal&eacute;'s first English commission was a map of an estate in Sussex, executed in 1774. There followed other similar commissions; the most important were the survey of the 6700 acre Mistley estate in Essex, home of the politician Richard Rigby, of which Scal&eacute; produced a volume of thirty-one very fine maps (subsequently in Essex Record Office), and that of the Essex estates of the Worshipful Company of Embroiderers (latterly at the Guildhall Library, London), a commission that may have fallen to him because of a family connection of his wife.<br>
<br>In 1786 Scal&eacute;'s wife was left a large fortune: this brought social advancement but a premature end to his career. The following year the family moved to Boreham, Essex, and in 1788 bought Noakes Place, Great Baddow, Essex, where they lived until 1803 when they moved to North Hill, Colchester. They moved in prosperous circles, having family, religious, and business links with successful Essex Huguenot families: their son Bernard graduated from St John's College, Cambridge, and was vicar of Braintree, Essex, from 1796 to 1852. Scal&eacute; styled himself a gentleman, and gave up surveying and cartography, having no instruments to leave by the time he made his will, though he continued to work as an estate agent. He was an established member of Colchester society, being a member of the Castle Book Society, and in 1811 was a member of the commission for &#145;improving the navigation from Hythe to Wivenhoe, and paving and better improving Colchester&#146;. His wife, Henrietta, died in 1824 and he followed on 26 January 1826, aged eighty-six, at his home, North Hill, Colchester. He was buried in Colchester.<br>
<br>Scal&eacute;, with his master, the ultimately more influential Rocque, transformed Irish large-scale cartography, in particular carrying the estate map &#145;from agent's office to library or drawing room&#146; (J. Andrews, <span class="italic">Irish maps</span>, Irish Heritage ser., 18, cited in Mason and Bensusan-Butt, 508). The contemporary rebuilding in towns and modernization of estates in Ireland gave scope for their work and their influence endured well into the nineteenth century.<br>
