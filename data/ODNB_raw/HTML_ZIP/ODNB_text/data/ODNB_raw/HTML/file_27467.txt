<span class="headword">Tinney,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1706&#150;1761), <span class="occ">engraver and printseller</span>, the son of John Tinney (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1673), of the Merchant Taylors' Company, was probably born in London. He was apprenticed for seven years to the engraver John Sturt on 3 August 1721 and made free of the Goldsmiths' Company on 8 April 1730. He was trading in Great Eastcheap, Cannon Street, in 1734 but is said to have spent some time in France. He took livery in the Goldsmiths' Company in May 1737 and set up at the sign of the Carved Golden Lion in Fleet Street, between Peterborough Court and the Globe tavern. In 1745 the contents of his shop were insured for &pound;300. There, according to his trade label, he sold &#145;great variety of French prints and several fine prints done from his own new copper plates, in neat frames and glasses or without, and all sorts of maps; also several new drawing books, copy books and great variety of royal sheets, lotteries &amp;c&#146; and &#145;performs engraving in all its branches in the neatest manner&#146;. He engraved competently in line and in mezzotint and trained a number of apprentices, of whom Anthony Walker, William Woollett, and John Browne became distinguished engravers. Advertisements in newspapers further reveal that Tinney published a wide variety of topical, satirical, and decorative prints. His <span class="italic">Compendium anatomicum</span> (1743) was an important early guide to human anatomy intended for artists. He was an important publisher of maps, the most remarkable being John Rocque's twenty-four-sheet <span class="italic">Plan of the Cities of London and Westminster</span> (1746), one of the greatest of all London maps.<br>
<br>About 1752 Tinney acquired from John Hinton the plates for Emanuel Bowen and Thomas Kitchen's <span class="italic">Large English Atlas</span> (1749&#150;60) which remained the most important English county atlas until the appearance of John Cary's in 1787. Robert Sayer and the Bowles brothers shared the cost of this enterprise from about 1755 and they also acquired shares in several of the sets of prints of country houses, villas, and gardens that Tinney published. He probably engraved the earliest of these himself, but later views were drawn and engraved by his pupils, notably by William Woollett. These views for tourists included sets depicting Chiswick House (1738, 1754), Hampton Court and Kensington Palace (1744), the Oxford colleges (1754), and Whitton and West Wycombe (1757). Tinney died a widower at Fulham, administration of his goods being granted to his sister Elizabeth Mackrabie on 14 April 1761.<br>
