<span class="headword">White,  John</span>  (1826&#150;1891), <span class="occ">ethnographer and public servant in New Zealand</span>, one of the eight children of Francis White, a blacksmith, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Angus, was born in Cockfield, co. Durham, on 3 January 1826, and emigrated to New Zealand with his family in 1834. They settled first at the Hokianga, North Island, and in 1851 moved to Auckland. On 13 March 1854 White married Mary Elizabeth Bagnall, with whom he had eight children. His early and continuing interest in the Maori and their customs led to his employment by the government in positions where he came into frequent contact with Maori. His career centred around appointments as official interpreter and agent for the purchase of native lands, and in this latter capacity he was instrumental in purchasing Maori land in Auckland. From 1852 he was gold commissioner at Coromandel, North Island, and between 1862 and 1865 he was resident magistrate at Wanganui.<br>
<br>White's reputation as an ethnographer and writer of both scholarly and fictional works based on Maori traditions led to his employment from 1879 by the government of New Zealand to compile a complete history of such traditions. These he collected at times by monetary payment and at others by trading European mythology and legends. He died suddenly <i>en route</i> for Whakatane, on the Bay of Plenty, North Island, on 13 January 1891. He had completed six volumes of <span class="italic">The Ancient History of the Maori</span>, the production of which was helped by neither government cost-cutting nor White's own variable powers of organization. It, and his other ethnographical work, was well received by contemporary scholars. Later commentators have drawn attention to his lack of scholarly vigour, but, as an early commentator on the Maori who based his remarks in large part on first-hand knowledge, helped by fluency in the language, he is undoubtedly important, and his achievements were remarkable.<br>
