<span class="headword">Lanigan,  John</span>  (1758&#150;1828), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and historian</span>, was born at Cashel, co. Tipperary, the eldest child of Thomas Lanigan, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Ann Dorkan. He was educated at his father's school and at a classical school kept by a protestant clergyman at Cashel. In 1776 he entered the Irish College at Rome to study for the Roman Catholic priesthood. Here his intellectual gifts attracted the attention and patronage of influential figures such as Cardinal Marefoschi and Pietro Tamburini, though he also showed evidence of a certain acerbity of temperament that led to a complaint from the cardinal to Archbishop James Butler of Cashel in 1783, shortly before his ordination. He was nevertheless ordained priest, and was then introduced to the University of Pavia by Tamburini, who had become a professor there.<br>
<br>Here Lanigan was deeply influenced by the &#145;Catholic Enlightenment&#146;, which in Italy was especially concerned with historical theology. In 1786 Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany, brother of Emperor Joseph II, encouraged the convocation of an ecclesiastical synod at Pistoia. The acts of this synod were denounced as Jansenistic, and in fact it received little support from the clergy or laity of Tuscany. Tamburini was the leading theologian at the synod, but Lanigan declined his invitation to take part in it. Despite this, his intellectual powers made such an impression at Pavia that in the spring of 1788 he was offered the professorship of scripture, Hebrew, and ecclesiastical history. At the same time, however, Archbishop Butler wrote from Ireland to say that Francis Moylan, recently appointed bishop of Cork, was planning to open a classical school, as permitted by legislation of 1782, and would like Lanigan to be headmaster. Lanigan accepted, but laid down a list of conditions, which although individually not unreasonable sounded peremptory when taken together. In the event he accepted the professorship in Pavia. His inaugural address, &#145;De origine et progressu hermeneuticae sacrae&#146;, was published in 1789. Shortly afterwards he published <span class="italic">Saggio sulla maniera d'insegnare a' giovani ecclesiastici la scienza de' libri sacri</span>. This was followed in 1793 by a substantial and valuable study of the history of the books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, <span class="italic">Institutionum Biblicarum pars prima</span>, and in 1794 he received the doctorate of divinity of the university.<br>
<br>Yet there are indications that Lanigan was not settled at Pavia, especially in his enquiries in 1795 to archbishops John Thomas Troy of Dublin and Thomas Bray of Cashel about the possibility of being appointed to a teaching post in the newly opened seminary at Maynooth in Ireland. Then in March 1796 Italy was invaded by the French Revolutionary army. The University of Pavia was closed, and Lanigan fled to Ireland. The news that he might apply for a post at Maynooth had already aroused misgivings, and when Lanigan landed in Cork he was coldly received by Bishop Francis Moylan, and likewise by Archbishop Bray in Cashel. He made his way to Dublin, where he was offered a post as assistant by Martin Hugh Hamill, once a fellow student in Rome and now parish priest of Francis Street Chapel. Meanwhile an appointment had been made to the chair of scripture in Maynooth, but the person appointed resigned early in 1797 and Lanigan applied for the post. This led to acrimonious exchanges, and it is not easy to be sure exactly what happened. Some of his friends claimed that he had been approached by the two most important episcopal members of the Maynooth board of trustees, the archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, but it is not easy to credit this. Another version is that he was proposed by the archbishop of Armagh, seconded by the archbishop of Dublin, and appointed, when Bishop Moylan, who had come late to the meeting, demanded that he first sign an anti-Jansenist formula. The truth is obscured by the heated exchanges that clearly took place, but Lanigan, so his friends said, turned down the appointment. The fact that there is no minute of an appointment in the journal of the Maynooth trustees does not, of course, necessarily imply that none was made, and it is clear that the taint of Jansenism that clung to Lanigan was undeserved.<br>
<br>This gifted scholar was now without a post. He was rescued by the Dublin Society, which appointed him in 1799 as &#145;translator, editor and corrector of the press&#146;, and in 1808 as librarian. In 1800 he published for the society <span class="italic">An Essay on the Practical History of the Sheep in Spain, and of the Spanish Sheep in Saxony</span> (1785), translated from a work by George Stumpf, a project surely dictated by financial needs rather than personal interests. He took part in the current controversies over Catholic emancipation and the veto, but his real interest became concentrated on Irish church history. He was a leading member of the group who founded the Gaelic Society in 1808, and he assiduously collected the material for his planned work. In 1813, however, the first signs of mental illness began to appear, and he was condemned to lengthening stays in an asylum in Finglas, to the north of Dublin, where he died, aged seventy, on 7 July 1828.<br>
<br>Lanigan's most important work, <span class="italic">An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland from the First Introduction of Christianity among the Irish to the Thirteenth Century</span>, was published in 1822. It ran to four volumes, including almost 2000 pages in all, and, given the state of Irish historical studies at the time, was a remarkable achievement. It was unashamedly confessional, in that it assailed the protestant historians who had written earlier, especially the most recent of them, Edward Ledwich. Lanigan's castigation of Ledwich in particular was deserved, but his tetchiness made it devastating. However, coupled with this was a remarkable knowledge of the sources then available, and a robust critical mind honed in the atmosphere of the Catholic Enlightenment in Pavia. J. F. Kenney, whose <span class="italic">Sources for the Early History of Ireland</span>, volume 1 (1929) is still in some respects the starting point for all exploration of the period, wrote, &#145;He became the Lingard of Irish church history, and his monumental work on that subject remains of value&#146;  (Kenney, 61).<br>
<br>Lanigan's personal library was sold a few months before his death. He was buried in the cemetery of Finglas parish church. In 1861 a cross with an inscription in Latin and Irish was erected over his grave.<br>
