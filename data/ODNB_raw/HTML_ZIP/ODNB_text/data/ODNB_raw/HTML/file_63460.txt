<span class="headword">Owen,  Walter Edwin</span>  (1879&#150;1945), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 7 June 1879 at 144 Phillips Street, Aston, Birmingham, the son of John Simpson Owen, a British army warrant officer, and his wife, Caroline Isabella Blair. He was brought up in Belfast. He trained in England as a Church Missionary Society missionary and was ordained deacon in 1904 and priest in 1905, embarking on his life's work as a missionary in east Africa. On 8 October 1907 he married Isabel Barnes (<i>d</i>. 1910), a fellow missionary, and, on 27 December 1911, Lucy Olive Walton of Wolverhampton (1876&#150;1953), also a missionary.<br>
<br>From 1904 to 1918 Owen worked on a succession of mission stations in Uganda: Bunyoro, Kabaro, and Kako, before, in 1918, becoming archdeacon of Kavirondo, in Kenya. Kavirondo had been evangelized from Uganda and had developed a vigorous church life as part of the Ugandan Native Anglican church. But in 1921 the archdeaconry was transferred to the diocese of Mombasa, a move which, in sharp contrast to Uganda, brought the African Christian community into a church structure increasingly driven by the needs and aspirations of the British settlers of Kenya colony. Owen attempted to mitigate the regressive effects of this for the Luo and Luyia peoples, immersing himself in the social and political life of Kenya. While appreciative of what, potentially, settlers could do for the development of the country, he was above all conscious of the duty of advocacy on behalf of the indigenous peoples:<blockquote>I believe that, just as in slavery many good Christian people had to be brought to see that Christianity and Slavery were incompatible so, today, many good Christian people have to be brought to see that certain features of British Administration in Kenya are but the modern expression of the desire for profit which gave rise to slavery. (Owen MSS, deposited in the CMS archives in the University of Birmingham: File 011, Owen to H. D. Hooper, 18 Sept 1939)</blockquote>Owen's vigorous campaigning, in particular his doggedly persistent correspondence to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, brought him into conflict with settlers (who nicknamed him the Archdemon), colonial officials, and missionary colleagues. He was critical of settler attempts to dominate the political process in Kenya at the expense of the native African population, and was supportive of Indian rights to immigration and political participation, which was popular with neither settlers nor missionaries. He was outspoken in his condemnation of forced labour&#151;whether by colonial diktat or the authoritarianism of local chiefs&#151;not only in Kenya but in Uganda where in 1926 he denounced the use of conscripted labour in the extension of the railway. He spoke out against the brutal methods used by the British authorities in the collection of the hut tax, involving the burning of the homes of defaulters. He defended African interests in the Kakamega gold rush of the early 1930s. His advocacy was unambiguously paternalistic, and has been criticized for stifling the development of an articulate African political consciousness: in 1921 he founded and was president of the Kavirondo Taxpayers' Welfare Association, effectively keeping local politics under mission aegis for much longer than in Kikuyuland.<br>
<br>Owen was strongly supportive of local culture&#151;he stressed, for example, that &#145;native&#146; marriage be recognized as valid. But at times this affirmation collided with his strongly developed sense of fair play and justice. He was fiercely protective of the rights of women, and mounted a long campaign against forced marriages. He had earlier, in Uganda, insisted on a strict interpretation of the marriage ordinance, even if this went against local custom, invoking it to protect the rights of Christian women against husbands who subsequently became polygamous. Owen was interested in rural development and education to undergird the rural economy. Theologically liberal, both in biblical teaching and social attitudes, he was impatient with attempts to censure church members who supplemented their income by local brewing, noting that although personally he was almost a teetotaller, he could not agree to a rule which would have meant Christ being disciplined for turning the water into wine at Cana of Galilee &#145;for public consumption&#146;. Owen was an enthusiastic amateur palaeontologist, and felt it important for the African church to be exposed to Darwinian accounts of creation. On retirement in 1945 he was made archdeacon emeritus and honorary canon of Mombasa Cathedral. He died on 18 September 1945 at Limuru, Kenya, and was buried in the churchyard of the settler church there. His second wife survived him. Max Warren, general secretary of the Church Missionary Society from 1942 to 1963, wrote of Owen: &#145;from him I caught the passionate conviction that the Gospel has to do with politics as well as souls. I learned about ecology from him long before anyone had thought of inventing the word&#146;  (M. Warren, <span class="italic">Crowded Canvas</span>, 1974, 41).<br>
