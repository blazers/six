<span class="headword">Young,  Peter</span>  (1915&#150;1988), <span class="occ">army officer and military historian</span>, was born at 54 Fulham Road, London, on 28 July 1915, the son of Dallas Hales Wilkie Young, clerk, and Irene Barbara Lushington Mellor, and educated at Monmouth School and Trinity College, Oxford. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire regiment in 1937, and was wounded during the evacuation from Dunkirk in 1940. As soon as he was fit again he volunteered for the newly formed commandos, with whom he had a distinguished war record, taking part in the commando raids on Guernsey, Lofoten and Vaagso, Dieppe, Sicily, and Italy, Normandy, and the Arakan (Burma). He was awarded the DSO and MC in 1942, and received in 1943 two more bars to his MC. When the war ended he was commanding the 1st commando brigade with the temporary rank of brigadier, aged only 30.<br>
<br>In the Dieppe raid Young was the only commando officer to reach his objective and bring back all his men. He managed to take his raiding force up the cliffs on a network of barbed wire which, as he put it, an over-conscientious German officer had inadvertently provided for them to walk on. He was awarded the DSO for his part in this raid. Later, in the Arakan, a fellow officer recalls seeing Young's commandos under attack at Kangaw from hordes of Japanese, and sending a message asking Young if he would like reinforcements. &#145;No thanks&#146;, came back the message, &#145;we can see this lot off all right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 14 Sept 1988).<br>
<br>It is not surprising that such an outstanding battlefield leader did not find it easy to adjust to more mundane peacetime soldiering. Young found it difficult to decide whether to remain in the army, where he would undoubtedly go far, or return to his first love, which was history, and which won in the end. But before retiring in 1959 in the rank of brigadier, Young enjoyed three successful and exhilarating years (1953&#150;6) in command of the 9th infantry regiment in the Arab Legion in Jordan. The 9th regiment was almost entirely Bedouin, and Young's somewhat swashbuckling character and obvious military ability led to a remarkable rapport between him and his <i>jundis</i> (Arab soldiers). This was notably increased when as commander of the Jerusalem garrison he successfully thwarted an Israeli attack. His prompt and effective handling of a very dangerous situation brought <i>sharf</i> (honour) to the regiment and added greatly to Young's popularity. However, it did not save Young from being included among the first of the British officers to be sent home in the wake of Glubb Pasha's dismissal in March 1956. This was owing to the fact that he and his regiment had been prominent in suppressing the anti-Baghdad pact riots that had torn Jordan apart at the end of 1955. He had married Joan Rathbone (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Duckworth) on 23 June 1950. They had no children.<br>
<br>Young retired from the army in order to become reader in military history at Sandhurst in 1959. He was there for ten years and his effect on the teaching of military history was dramatic. He recruited some of Britain's outstanding military historians&#151;John Keegan, David Chandler, and Christopher Duffy, to name but a few&#151;and inspired them by his own enthusiasm and erudition. He had always been particularly interested in the English civil war and in 1968 he founded the Sealed Knot Society of Cavaliers and Roundheads, in order to re-enact battles and engagements of that conflict. Dressed in period costume, which they had to provide themselves, they refought Naseby, Marston Moor, and so on, with Young as the somewhat portly &#145;Captain Generall&#146; sporting a Van Dyck beard and flowing locks, mounted on a horse and directing proceedings. The society won for itself a national reputation, and people flocked to watch the battles taking place at various pageants and shows.<br>
<br>A prolific writer of books and articles, Young as an author might have been wiser to concentrate on the civil war, on which he became something of an authority. <span class="italic">The Great Civil War</span> (1959) was typical. He was editor-in-chief of Purnell's <span class="italic">History of the First World War</span> and Orbis's <span class="italic">History of World War II</span>. He also published an interesting account of his time in the Arab Legion, entitled <span class="italic">Bedouin Command</span> (1956). His books on the civil war are likely to outlive the others. In the field of military history his opinions were always listened to with respect, if not always without argument. As a soldier he possessed nearly all the qualities which could have taken him to the highest ranks&#151;physical courage, robustness, common sense, personality, intelligence, and leadership&#151;but he did not much enjoy peacetime soldiering, and would not have fitted easily into Whitehall. His decision to go for history was probably the right one.<br>
<br>There was about him something larger than life. He was in character essentially Elizabethan, a robust and rumbustious soldier&#150;scholar, as ready to singe the king of Spain's beard as to enter into disputation with learned men concerning some matter of academic controversy. He also possessed a remarkably kind heart and gave much of his time to helping others, particularly budding historians. He died in Cheltenham General Hospital on 13 September 1988, and his funeral took place at St Mary's Church, Ripple, Worcestershire, on 4 October.<br>
