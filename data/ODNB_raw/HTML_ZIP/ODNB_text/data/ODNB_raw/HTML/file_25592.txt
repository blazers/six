<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson,  Sidrach</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1655), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born in Lincolnshire, perhaps at Boston; his parents' names are unknown, but he had at least two brothers&#151;Joshua (later of Boston) and Robert (later of Bristol). He was admitted sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1616, but migrated the following year to Queens' College, where he graduated BA in 1622 and proceeded MA in 1625. Ordained in 1623, he seems to have first served as preacher at Black Notley in Essex. He became curate and lecturer at St Margaret's, New Fish Street Hill, London, in 1629. In 1635, he was convened, along with John Stoughton and John Goodwin, before the bishop of London for breach of the canons of the church, but upon &#145;their promised amendment and submission to the Church in all things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; William Laud</span>, 5.333) Bishop Juxon took no further action against them. However, Simpson decided to leave his living in London and went into exile in the Netherlands either in late 1637 or early 1638. There he renounced his English ordination and joined at Rotterdam an independent English church with John Ward as pastor and William Bridge as teacher. Discord soon arose between him and Bridge over the issue of prophesying; consequently Simpson withdrew and erected a new church with himself as pastor. In his later answers to the charge of schism Simpson maintained that he had not gathered a church against a church and that the place where his church met was &#145;in an open street, a noted place, neer the Exchange&#146;  (S. Simpson, <span class="italic">Anatomist Anatomis'd</span>, 1644, 11). With Simpson's church at Rotterdam was also associated Joseph Symonds, another London minister in exile.<br>
<br>Simpson returned to London in 1641 and lectured at Blackfriars as well as St Margaret's, New Fish Street Hill. According to Thomas Edwards, Simpson used these lectures frequently to propagate the Independent church way, &#145;pleading strongly for it, and for pretended liberty of conscience and toleration&#146;  (Edwards, 215). In the meantime he had gathered an Independent church in the City, which was, again in the words of Edwards, &#145;a rich and numerous Church, consisting of so many Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, rich Citizens, rich virgins, &amp;c.&#146;  (ibid., 222). No record of Simpson's gathered church in London has survived, but it is known that among its members were some prominent civic leaders in the revolutionary era such as Alderman Thomas Andrewes, Alderman Samuel Warner, and Captain John Stone. Henry Dawson, alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne, was also a member. In a sermon Simpson preached in 1642 before a group of MPs at Westminster he spoke candidly against a national church and religious uniformity. &#145;God gives gifts and graces diversly&#146;, he said, and then added &#145;Christ hath Sonnes of divers sizes&#146;  (Simpson, 31). On 26 July 1643 he was invited by the House of Commons to preach a fast sermon, which he published under the title of <span class="italic">Reformation's Preservation</span> (1643). In his epistle of dedication he called upon the Commons to save the nation by &#145;the speedy execution of justice&#146; and &#145;the vigorous prosecution of the warre&#146;.<br>
<br>Nominated to the Westminster assembly of divines in June 1643, he appears to have attended its meetings regularly, and he frequently registered his dissent. More important, he joined with Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, William Bridge, and Jeremiah Burroughes, all of whom had been in exile in the Netherlands, to form a nucleus of dissent in the assembly. Early in 1644 they published their famous <span class="italic">Apologeticall Narration</span>, which, though written with studied restraint and moderation, was none the less an open appeal over the assembly to parliament and to the nation for their congregational church way. And in the ensuing two years Simpson took part in all the concerted actions of the dissenting brethren of the assembly in opposition to the establishment of a rigid presbyterianism. In 1647 he became lecturer at St Mary Abchurch, where Joseph Symonds had been chosen minister by the parish, and he succeeded Symonds as minister in 1649. During these years he was apparently associated with more radical men like John Goodwin, John Canne, and Vavasor Powell. In early 1648 he was said to be one of twelve ministers sent for by Cromwell to preach in the army, and on 20 September 1650, not long after Cromwell's victory at Dunbar, he wrote to the lord general and urged him: &#145;Goe on therefore, my Lord, you are throwing downe what God is throwing downe&#146;  (Nickolls, 22&#150;4). Later in the year the parliamentary visitors of Cambridge University appointed him master of Pembroke College.<br>
<br>It was at this juncture that Simpson became more conservative in his religious views. In April&#150;May 1651 he took action against Captain Robert Norwood, a member of his gathered church, who had apparently harboured pantheistic beliefs, and eventually excommunicated him for blasphemy. On 10 February 1652 he appeared with John Owen and other Independent divines before the House of Commons and presented a petition against the anti-Trinitarian Racovian catechism, and a week later they submitted to a parliamentary committee their proposals for the propagation of the gospel. In 1653, at the commencement of Cambridge University, Simpson preached in defence of learning and university education for the ministry, which provoked William Dell, a former army chaplain and now master of Gonville and Caius College, to publish <span class="italic">A Plain and Necessary Confutation</span>. It has been said that Simpson was imprisoned in 1654 for preaching against Cromwell, but this must have been mistaken. All known facts indicate that he supported the Cromwellian protectorate: on 9 January he signed a circular letter denouncing the Fifth Monarchy Men; on 28 February he was one of the Independent divines consulted by Cromwell for a religious settlement; and on 20 March he was appointed a trier. In the meantime he was proffered by the great seal the rectory of St Bartholomew by the Exchange in spite of the fact that the parish had chosen for the place George Hall, the future bishop of Chester.<br>
<br>Simpson made his will on 2 April 1655, and died shortly afterwards at St Bartholomew by the Exchange, his will being proved on 15 April. He was buried on 18 April at St Bartholomew. He was survived by his wife, Isabella, of whom nothing else is known, and by his children, Sydrach, Katherine (wife of Joseph Denham), and Priscilla; a third daughter (almost certainly deceased) had married James Lane. It appears that Simpson possessed considerable assets at the time of his death, including land and tenements in the parish of Bocking in Essex. Two volumes of Simpson's sermons were published posthumously in 1658 from notes taken in shorthand by Captain Mark Coe, another member of Simpson's gathered church and one of the overseers of his will.<br>
