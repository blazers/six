<span class="headword">Plukenet,  Leonard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1642, <em>d.</em> 1706), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was baptized on 4 January 1642, one of several children of Robert Plucknett and his wife, Elizabeth. The family, apparently well-to-do, lived in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, in which he in turn was to live for most of his life. After Westminster School, where his contemporaries included William Courten and Robert Uvedale, he matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, in November 1662, but no record of a degree there (or anywhere else) has been traced. Though styled &#145;doctor in physick&#146;, his name is not on the roll of the College of Physicians nor in the records of the Society of Apothecaries, so if he subsequently practised medicine in London, as traditionally assumed, this must have been on some less official basis. A farm in the Chilterns and twenty houses in Westminster which he owned at the time of his will could be evidence of his having prospered in that occupation, though inherited wealth is equally possible. On 6 November 1669 he married Letitia, daughter of George Manley; they had seven children.<br>
<br>The earliest dated reference to Plukenet as a botanist is not until his middle age, in a letter from Ray to Sloane in 1684. The extent of his knowledge by then suggests it had been acquired over a considerable period, perhaps initially through field botanizing, for records entered in his copy of Ray's <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum Angliae</span> (1670) reveal a good acquaintance with the wild flora of the London area. (Others from further afield are noticeably numerous from Lincolnshire, doubtless made on visits to a cousin, Captain Anthony Irby, of Boston.) Plukenet's main concern, though, was to amass a herbarium as representative as possible of the plants of the known world, on similar lines to those of Sloane and Petiver; he emerges in contemporary correspondence as a principal competitor and critic of the two men. Though he had a small botanical garden at his home in St Margaret's Lane, near Old Palace Yard in Westminster, and had access to the living collections of fellow botanists, most of his acquisitions came from correspondents in often distant countries overseas. The eventual 8000 specimens and more (incorporated in the Sloane Herbarium in the Natural History Museum) include some of special interest from St Helena, the earliest examples of that island's endemic plants, some of them now long extinct. In striking contrast to Petiver's, Plukenet's collection is a model of neatness, but unfortunately the source of specimens is rarely indicated, though, as many of the figures in his works were copied from those, the missing data can to some extent be reconstructed.<br>
<br>Again in contrast to Petiver, Plukenet refrained from publishing interim, partial catalogues of his collection and instead chose to embody it in a sequence of four magisterial volumes (the first three brought out at his own expense) which together amounted to a single work. These were the four-part <span class="italic">Phytographia</span> (1691&#150;6), the <span class="italic">Almagestum botanicum</span> (1696), the <span class="italic">Almagesti botanici mantissa</span> (1700), and the <span class="italic">Amaltheum botanicum</span> along with an index to the whole (1705). The last two were effectively supplements. So highly valued was this corpus that a six-volume collected edition, made up out of surplus copies, was called for in 1720 and itself earned a reprint in 1769. This value lay in the fact that, in Pulteney's words, &#145;no work before published by one man ever exhibited so great a number of new plants&#146;  (Pulteney, 2.27). The <span class="italic">Phytographia</span>, the principal volume, consisted wholly of plates, 250 in all, each made up of a number of small figures, with the names and synonyms of the plants depicted printed underneath. Several British plants made their first appearance in these. The <span class="italic">Almagestum</span> followed, with descriptions of several thousand species arranged alphabetically under the generic names of earlier authors. Though Ray found much to fault in the Latin, contemporary and later botanists made much use of both for identifying plants. Linnaeus in particular relied on the <span class="italic">Phytographia</span> extensively, lauding it as &#145;<i>opus incomparabile</i>&#146;. An <span class="italic">Index Linnaeanus</span>, collating Plukenet's figures with the latter's species, was subsequently compiled by P. D. Giseke and published in Hamburg in 1779.<br>
<br>Plukenet felt that his labours were under-appreciated and a certain testiness seems to have been the result. Sloane describes him in letters as &#145;reserved, jealous of his reputation, and none of the best nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Ray</span>, 306&#150;7) as well as &#145;a little conceited and opinionated &hellip; incapable of advice&#146;  (ibid., 299&#150;300). If his equals in botany disappointed him, however, royal patronage in some degree made up for that: soon after the accession of William and Mary in 1689 he was appointed superintendent of the royal gardens at Hampton Court, that horticultural king's pre-eminent concern, and with it took the title of &#145;queen's botanist&#146; or &#145;royal professor of botany&#146;&#151;no doubt in emulation of the Jardin du Roi in Paris. This he may have owed to the influence of his Irby cousins.<br>
<br>In his final years Plukenet seems to have developed an interest in insects. A collection of some 1700 specimens, by no means all butterflies and moths, pressed flat and mounted like dried plants in a book, with names in English and roughly arranged by &#145;orders&#146;, was subsequently acquired by Sloane and is now in the Natural History Museum in London. A notebook in Plukenet's hand apparently relates to this and suggests most were taken in the neighbourhood of the city. If so, this has a claim to be the oldest collection of British insects in existence.<br>
<br>Plukenet died at Westminster on 6 July 1706 and was buried on 12 July in the chancel of St Margaret's, Westminster, the church in which he had been baptized. His wife, Letitia, is probably the woman of that name buried there only a few months later. To her he bequeathed his vast collection and all his botanical books. Most of the former was eventually purchased by Sloane, the rest by Philip Carteret Webb. <i>Plukenetia</i>, a genus of mainly tropical members of the spurge family, was named in his honour by Plumier and perpetuated by Linnaeus.<br>
