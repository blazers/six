<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  Gawain Westray</span>  (1909&#150;1995), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and diplomatist</span>, was born on 21 January 1909 in Cape Town, the only son of William Westray Bell (<i>d</i>. 1946), shipping executive and later a stockbroker, and his wife, Emily Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kisch (1880&#150;1971), daughter of an Anglo-Austrian mining engineer in South Africa. His family originally came from Latterhead in the Cumbrian sheep-farming uplands. Bell spent his childhood in South Africa, where his father was employed by the New Zealand Shipping Company (founded by his grandmother's family, the Westrays of Whitehaven), first in Basrah and then from 1901 in Cape Town. After preparatory school at Wynburg he went to Britain in 1919, entering the Dragon School, Oxford, and then Winchester College in 1922 and Hertford College, Oxford, in 1927. At Oxford he read medieval and modern history (graduating with a second-class degree in 1930), followed the Magdalen and New College beagles, was a member of the Officers' Training Corps, and captained the Oxford shooting eight. Putting aside the thought of the army but seeking a career abroad, Bell applied for both the colonial administrative and the Sudan political service. Accepted for the &eacute;lite latter, he was at twenty-two too young to be sent to Africa, so he spent an extra year at Oxford attending the tropical African services course for colonial probationers. Part of his training was to witness surgery at the Radcliffe Hospital, &#145;to accustom ourselves to the sight of blood and severed limbs&#146;  (Bell, <span class="italic">An Imperial Twilight</span>, 16). He promptly fainted.<br>
<br>Bell arrived in Khartoum in 1931. Although he was to spend over twenty years in Sudan, unusually in the political service he was given a number of outside assignments. In 1938 he was seconded to the colonial service administration of the Palestine mandate, serving as deputy district commissioner in Gaza and Beersheba. An accomplished horseman, he reconstituted the camel gendarmerie. He had a colourful war in the Middle East, joining the Cruze cavalry and rising to colonel in the Arab Legion under General Sir John Glubb. He returned to Sudan in 1945 as district commissioner of al-&#145;Ubayd, and again served outside when he became deputy Sudan agent in Cairo in 1949. Back in Khartoum in 1951, he was promoted deputy civil secretary and then permanent secretary to the new ministry of the interior. He was the last member of the administration to leave Sudan, in December 1954.<br>
<br>At forty-five Bell was too young and his Arabic too fluent for him to wait long among colleagues testing the job market in Britain. Ironically, in view of what was to come, he was offered the job of managing a soda water factory in Northern Nigeria. The Colonial Office had him in mind for the chief secretaryship of Aden, but the Foreign Office got in first and Bell went as political agent to Kuwait. An attempt was made on his life in Kuwait in 1956, as in Palestine in 1938. In 1957 the Colonial Office's turn came, when Bell accepted the patently final governorship of Northern Nigeria. One of the attractions was that he would once again be working with his longtime Sudan colleague Sir James Robertson, now governor-general of the federation of Nigeria. It was a post which called for all Bell's previous experience of the transfer of power and all his skill as a diplomat. Not only was there the challenge of being a colonial governor yet with an elected premier and cabinet, there was also the legendary sensitivity of the premier, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, to handle. The extremes in gubernatorial style between Bell and his predecessor Sir Bryan Sharwood Smith were widely perceived.<br>
<br>Having retired for the second time in 1962 (the Northern Nigerian cabinet paid him the compliment of asking him to stay on as governor for two years beyond independence), Bell had a short spell as secretary-general of the Council for Middle East Trade before again being approached for government service. With Sir Ralph Hone he helped to devise a new constitution for the federation of south Arabia in 1965. Other Arabian missions followed, to Oman in 1966 (and again in 1974), and to the Trucial States. From 1966 to 1970 he was secretary-general of the South Pacific Commission, based in New Caledonia.<br>
<br>In retirement the Bells occupied the National Trust property at Hidcote Bartrim Manor, Chipping Campden, where they had resided since 1959. On 19 January 1945 he had married Silvia Cornwell-Clyne, a photographic technician, whom he had known since 1937. She was the daughter of Adrian Cornwell-Clyne, a photographic expert, of Esher, Surrey, and the cousin of a colleague in Sudan, Martin Parr, who in turn was the brother of Bell's teacher at Winchester, Jack. She shared her husband's lifelong love of riding, and her wedding present to him was a superb grey, Cloud (a whole chapter in his memoirs was given over to horses). For five years Bell sat as part-time chairman of the civil service commission (1972&#150;7). He became vice-president of the charity Lepra, was on the governing body of the School of Oriental and African Studies, and was active in the Anglo-Jordanian Society. He turned to writing his memoirs, publishing <span class="italic">Shadows on the Sand</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">An Imperial Twilight</span> (1989). The critic Marghanita Laski praised them for their &#145;knack of immensely attractive and inviting story-telling&#146;  (Kirk-Greene). In 1990 the Bells moved to a smaller house in East Ilsley, Berkshire, anticipating the ill health that was to accompany their later years. Bell continued to research into local Eberington history as well as to co-compile a register of his Sudan colleagues' post-retirement employment. He organized a major conference on Sudan at Durham University, resulting in a valuable expansion of the Sudan archive there.<br>
<br>Of Bell it was said that &#145;spiritually he never left Winchester, with its legacy of those myriad meaningful ways in which Manners truly maketh Man&#146;  (Kirk-Greene). Forty years' experience as an overseas administrator and consummate diplomat, combined with a reputation throughout the Arab world for courtesy and cultural empathy, contributed to Bell's image as a model latter-day proconsul. Intimately involved in overseeing the process of the transfer of power in Sudan, Nigeria, and the south Pacific, he was on each occasion the last British holder of the post. He was appointed MBE (military) in 1942, CBE in 1955, KCMG in 1957, and a knight of St John in 1958. He died of pneumonia at Battle Hospital, Reading, on 26 July 1995. His body was donated for medical research, and his ashes were deposited at Winchester College by the Bell gate (named after his uncle Gawain Murdoch Bell, a housemaster who was killed at Ypres in 1917). He was survived by his wife, who died in 1996, and by three daughters.<br>
