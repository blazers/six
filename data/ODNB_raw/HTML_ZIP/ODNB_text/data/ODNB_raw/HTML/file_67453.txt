<span class="headword">Biddulph <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Fitton]</span>,  Peter</span>  (1602&#150;1657), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in the county town of Stafford, the fourth son of Richard Biddulph of Biddulph Hall and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Draycott of Painsley, a recusant couple who had two other sons as priests, each of whom also used the alias Fitton. After some schooling in England, where he learned Latin and Greek, Peter studied at the English College at St Omer from 1613 until 1619, when he went to join the English College at Rome, which he entered on 28 October. He received minor orders on 11 July 1621, but two years later, on 23 October 1623, he was expelled for insubordination with five others. He was considered the ringleader of the affair, which became known as the Fitton rebellion, but the Vatican authorities took a more tolerant view, ordering the college on 21 November 1624 to send Biddulph and most of his fellow rebels to Douai, where they were to continue their studies at the expense of the English College.<br>
<br>Biddulph was ordained priest at Cambrai on 24 September 1625 and remained at Douai until May 1627, save for a brief visit to Paris in 1625. On 14 May 1627 he left for England but returned to Douai on 13 November, moving to Paris a week later, where he continued his studies at Arras College. In July 1631 he was sent to Rome as clergy agent for Bishop Richard Smith, who had taken up residence at Paris that year. Smith's attempts to exercise episcopal authority did not get a sympathetic hearing in Rome and Biddulph's position was an unenviable one, especially given his previous relations with the English College. He asked to be allowed to return home in 1636, and this was granted in March 1638, when he was admitted to court. He gained some credit there and in 1640 was again sent to Rome as clergy agent, this time with the additional responsibility of representing Queen Henrietta Maria until the arrival there of Kenelm Digby. He left Rome in 1643 and was made dean of the English chapter in 1644, though he does not seem to have resided in England but operated through his subdean, Mark Harrington. He was probably living in the exile Catholic community at Paris during these years and was named, along with William Clifford, as superior of the Coll&egrave;ge de Tournai on 20 April 1645. He apparently returned to London to preside at the general assembly of the chapter held in August 1649, and was sent once more to Rome as clergy agent in May 1650, remaining there until 1654, and resigning the agency in January 1655, when he was living in Florence. On the death of Bishop Smith his name was one of those presented to the papal nuncio as episcopabilis. The following year the London chapter wanted him to resume his work as agent in Rome, but his health was poor, and he was given the post of librarian to Prince Leopold, the brother of the grand duke of Tuscany. He died at Florence in the middle of 1657, his death being noted by the chapter at London on 29 July.<br>
