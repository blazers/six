<span class="headword">Howel <span class="st"> [Howell]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1537), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, was the son of John Howel, a prosperous and well-established merchant of Bristol, and his wife, Alice, who subsequently married Sir Thomas Morgan of Pen-coed, Monmouthshire. His father's family seems originally to have come from Monmouthshire. Born and bred in Bristol, Howel went to Spain about 1502 as an apprentice to Hugh Elyot, a merchant of Bristol. Howel married Joanna Christian, who proved to be an admirable wife and business associate to him. By 1507 he had moved to London and become a freeman of the Drapers' Company, and in 1512 he enlisted the interest of William Roche, warden of that company. In 1514 he was retained by the earl of Surrey for military service in France. He joined the livery of the Drapers' Company in 1517 and in 1527 became its junior warden.<br>
<br>By this time, Howel had long been a very successful and wealthy merchant engaged in Anglo-Spanish commercial exchanges. He traded in fine cloths of all kinds which he exported to Spain and in return imported oil, alum, iron, raisins, and wine. He stated in June 1528 that he had been in Spain on and off for about twenty-six years, and in that year he took up permanent residence in Seville. He left his wife to look after his affairs in London; she died in 1529. One of the most interesting remains of Howel's activities as a merchant is the remarkable ledger he kept. Deposited with the Drapers' Company during his lifetime and preserved in Drapers' Hall ever since, it is of unique interest for two reasons: for the light it sheds on Anglo-Spanish trade during the early Tudor period, and as the earliest surviving English example of double-entry bookkeeping.<br>
<br>Howel's health was failing by 1536, when he drew up his third and final will, and he died and was buried in Seville the following year. Under the terms of his will he left by far the biggest sixteenth-century charitable endowment for marriage subsidies. Having no children, Howel bequeathed 12,000 ducats in gold to his company to be employed in the purchase of land so as to raise 400 ducats a year to provide marriage portions for deserving Welsh maidens, with an indicated preference for orphan girls of his own lineage. Although many benefited from the bequest, it also gave rise to much controversy and litigation. Finally, the report of the fourth Charity Commission of 1837 dealt with Howell's Trust among other charities. A private act of parliament (1853) provided for a scheme to regulate Howell's Charity. In 1860 two girls' schools, each known as Howell's School, were established, one at Llandaff and the other at Denbigh. They have since become two of the best-known schools in Wales.<br>
