<span class="headword">Jowett,  Alfred</span>  (1914&#150;2004), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 29 May 1914 at 49 Hastings Road, Ecclesall, Sheffield, the only son of Alfred Edmund Jowett, pawnbroker and jeweller, without whom &#145;the poor would have starved&#146;, and his wife, Phoebe Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drabble, who loved literature. His parents' concerns for the deprived and for culture became central to Jowett's life. He was educated at High Storrs grammar school, Sheffield, and then gained a second-class degree in English in the Leavis era at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He taught English at Ecclesfield grammar school, Sheffield, from 1936, and then Poole grammar school, Dorset. On 3 August 1939 he married Margaret Mabel Benford, a 30-year-old history teacher, and daughter of St Clair Benford, statistical clerk. Her rationality complemented his religious wisdom, and in later life her public office as a JP and Labour city councillor reinforced his civic commitment. They provided the hospitality of an extended family wherever they lived. They had four children, Nicholas, later ordained, Rosalind, Sonya, and Celia.<br>
<br>As a conscientious objector with pacifist and socialist beliefs Jowett was forced to leave teaching soon after the outbreak of the Second World War and work on the land. He was then supported by Bishop Leslie Hunter of Sheffield, an inspired selector of future church leaders, to train for the ordained ministry at Lincoln Theological College in 1943, under Eric Abbott's guidance. He developed lifelong commitments to the ecumenical movement, the welfare state, a less class-ridden society, and a united Europe. Formative years in education were augmented by developing the church's ministry in the post-war redevelopment of northern cities. Beginning as curate at St John the Evangelist, Goole (1944&#150;7), he was summoned by Bishop Hunter to be secretary to the Sheffield Anglican and Free Church Council, and to the Sheffield Marriage Guidance Council (1947&#150;51), in which posts he proved innovatory. Hunter then tested him in parish ministry, as vicar of St George with St Stephen, Sheffield (1951&#150;60), close to the university and deprived areas. There he developed a mixed community of university families, and people of need and talent. The latter included Ted Wickham, industrial mission pioneer, and Alan Ecclestone, priest and Marxist writer of contemporary spiritual classics. Jowett's pioneering work on the Sheffield Africa Committee and family service unit, and a part-time lectureship in Sheffield University's education department (1950&#150;60), were rooted in an open house and church community with innovatory Sunday worship and parish breakfast. He then moved to be vicar of Doncaster (1960&#150;64), the &#145;church of the Coal Board&#146;, and honorary canon of Sheffield Cathedral, quickly engaging in civic life.<br>
<br>Jowett's formative years in education, church, and civic life prepared him to lead Manchester Cathedral from 1964 to 1983 as one of the outstanding urban deans of the twentieth century. Supported by a strong chapter, including Ronald Preston, the leading Christian social ethicist, and Frank Wright, an adult educationist and adviser to Granada TV, he developed his pioneering civic and public ministry. His contributions included service on city and national church education committees. His work focused on community (or race) relations in Britain, initially in Manchester, then on a wider stage after he was chosen by Harold Wilson to be a member of the Community Relations Commission in 1968, becoming deputy chairman from 1972 to 1977, and working full-time for the commission for two years. Such work encouraged the Church of England as a whole to take a stand against racism. It also allowed Jowett to serve on the side of the underprivileged. His choices were prophetic of later global concerns, as were his commitments to women's ordination, and homosexual rights. In addition, linking to Manchester University's extramural department, Jowett used the cathedral for teaching adults, particularly connecting theology, spirituality, and contemporary literature. The cathedral was also the venue for an arts festival, including performances by Sir John Barbirolli and the Hall&eacute; Orchestra, and provided an early home for the Royal Exchange Theatre. In recognition of his civic contributions Jowett was appointed CBE in 1972, and a member of the order of St John in 1979; he received the honorary degree of DLitt from Sheffield University in 1982, and was made a freeman of the city of Manchester in 1984.<br>
<br>Jowett's addresses to schools, civic gatherings, and memorials were of a high order, combining literary skills with contemporary theology and relevance. For a headmasters' conference he characteristically linked Christ and Camus, Golgotha and Vietnam. Particularly innovatory was his commitment to European and Christian unity through twinning the cathedral with Toulouse and the basilica of St Sernin. He led the chapter to commission Tony Hollaway, a designer and maker of stained glass, to build a complete west end of five great windows using modern designs. Inspiring all these contributions was his belief, like William Temple, an earlier bishop of Manchester, that Christianity was the most material of all religions. Jowett's only publication (as part-author), <span class="italic">The English Church: a New Look</span> (1966), elaborated this theme further, as did sermons as select preacher at Oxford University in 1964 and 1979. After a life of public service in church and city, he retired to Sheffield in 1983, contributing to St John's, Ranmoor, until his death on 28 July 2004 at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, of aspiration pneumonia following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their four children.<br>
