<span class="headword">Stewart,  Andrew</span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">broadcasting executive</span>, was born at 49 Benview Street, Glasgow, on 23 June 1907, the only son of James Stewart, railway clerk, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCheyne. He was educated at North Kelvinside secondary school, Glasgow, and at the University of Glasgow, where he took his MA in French language and literature. He was prominent in his school dramatic society, and after leaving university he worked briefly as an actor and assistant stage manager with the Scottish National Players, then under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie. It was on Guthrie's recommendation that he went to London to see John Reith, general manager of the British Broadcasting Company. The nineteen-year old Stewart saw him in his office at Savoy Hill and, after being quizzed for an hour, was told he was appointed a programme assistant in Glasgow. Apart from a short break during the war he went on to serve the BBC for nearly forty-two years. On 17 April 1937 he married, at Sherbrooke church, Glasgow, Agnes Isabella Burnet (Lily) McKechnie (1905&#150;1991), daughter of James McKechnie, managing director of a general warehouse, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murdoch. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Stewart's early progress was swift: he was appointed Scottish programme director, based in Edinburgh, at the age of twenty-eight. When war came he was anxious to take a commission in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Two days before he was to join them at Maryhill barracks, Glasgow, he was seconded to the Ministry of Information. There he worked again with Sir John Reith, during his brief tenure as minister of information. Stewart admired him inordinately. After Winston Churchill had decided to replace Reith with Duff Cooper, Stewart left the ministry, in May 1941, and rejoined the BBC as programme director in Glasgow.<br>
<br>Promotion came in 1948 when Stewart was appointed controller, Northern Ireland. Within the BBC the Belfast posting was not thought of highly and he was at first reluctant to go, but as a staunch Presbyterian he went down well in Northern Ireland and won the respect of the Unionist establishment, so much so that on one occasion he was invited by Sir Basil Brooke, the prime minister of Northern Ireland, to attend a cabinet meeting when broadcasting was discussed. Unlike Scotland and Wales, which had national broadcasting councils, Northern Ireland had only an advisory council. Even at that time&#151;the early 1950s&#151;broadcasting in Northern Ireland faced special stresses, and independent reporting from London on issues within Ulster was almost impossible because of local sensibilities.<br>
<br>In 1953 Stewart was promoted to one of the most senior posts within the BBC as controller, Home Service, based at Broadcasting House in London. There were then three national radio programmes&#151;the Home, the Light, and the Third&#151;and there was still a BBC monopoly. Radio, boosted by its immense achievements during the war, was the senior partner, with television regarded as an upstart. Stewart was an austere man with a strong sense of hierarchy; for him Reith's currency was &#145;still the only legal tender&#146;  (Bridson, 227). He insisted on high standards, but in spite of his somewhat cold, unbending manner he was liked and respected by many within Broadcasting House. But change was not far away: commercial television arrived in 1955, and suddenly the BBC had to be competitive. Stewart's hopes of succeeding Sir Ian Jacob as director-general diminished; this was not the time for the BBC to be led by an instinctively cautious man.<br>
<br>In 1957 Stewart went back to Scotland as controller. The Scottish National Council of Broadcasting greeted this news &#145;with acclamation&#146; but suggested that he should be promoted to director, Scotland. This was rejected by the board of governors as &#145;invidious&#146;, but the board emphasized that going back to Scotland would not prejudice his chances for future promotion. Nevertheless Stewart returned to Glasgow a disappointed and, in the view of many, a bitter man. His relationship with the man appointed (in 1959) director-general, Hugh Carleton Greene, was frosty. Stewart took with him to Broadcasting House, Glasgow, the desk that Reith had used as the BBC's first director-general. His leadership had echoes of his old master: firm, unbending, and out of sympathy with the spirit of the 1960s. On occasion he differed from his colleagues in the south on issues such as &#145;moral standards in television programmes&#146;. He told the board of governors that he was opposed to broadcasting the film <span class="italic">Hiroshima mon amour</span> because in his view &#145;a particular sequence&#146; made it unsuitable. The director-general argued that showing the film at 9.25 p.m. was justified by its &#145;acknowledged artistic value&#146;  (Briggs, 366). When a member of staff suggested to Stewart that Scotland might follow the example of the BBC West Region with its pioneering specialization in wildlife programmes his reply was: &#145;No, we are a nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 21 Dec 1991). The service continued as before, reflecting the wide range of Scottish interests.<br>
<br>When Stewart was due to retire, having reached the age of sixty, Alasdair Milne was named his successor. An arrangement was made whereby Milne would take up residence in Glasgow and start work with the BBC there before taking over as controller on Stewart's official retirement date of 1 July 1968. In the event he took over on 1 January 1968 because Sir Hugh Greene learned that Stewart would join Scottish Television (STV), the BBC's commercial rival, as a director. Greene asked him to go at once. Stewart remained on the board of STV until 1977. He was also chairman of the Films of Scotland Committee, a governor of the National Film School, and chairman of the Scottish Music Archive. There was one other distinction in his retirement: when Lord Reith became lord rector of Glasgow University he invited Stewart to be his assessor. The LLD conferred on him by the university in 1970 was regarded as a well-deserved battle honour. He was appointed CBE in 1954. He died 5 November 1991 at his home, 36 Sherbrooke Avenue, Glasgow, from lung cancer. His wife predeceased him by a few months.<br>
