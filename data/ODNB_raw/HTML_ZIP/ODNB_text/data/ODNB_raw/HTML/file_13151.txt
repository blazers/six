<span class="headword">Hewitt,  John</span>  (1807&#150;1878), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in Beacon Street, Lichfield, the son of John Hewitt (1772&#150;1848), preceptor, organist, and music teacher, and his wife, Betsy Warren. Educated at Lichfield grammar school, he studied music in his youth, and was for some time organist of St Mary's Church in that city. On 27 June 1840 he was appointed to the post of a clerk to the Board of Ordnance storekeeper, whose department, in the Tower of London, was responsible for the storage and issue of all arms and equipment for the army, including the national collection of historical arms and armour, then classified as &#145;obsolete stores&#146;. This did not then have an official curator, and Hewitt, having a bent towards the study of antiquities, was apparently encouraged to take a special interest in it. In 1841 he published <span class="italic">The Tower: its History, Armouries, and Antiquities; before and since the Fire</span>, which set a new standard of scholarship for works of this kind and also appears to have been the first government-sponsored guide to any historical site in Britain. This was followed in 1855 by the first volume, and in 1860 by the second and third volumes, of his <span class="italic">Ancient armour and weapons in Europe from the iron period of the northern nations to the end of the seventeenth century</span> (reprinted 1967), which, although it owed much to Sir Samuel Meyrick's pioneering <span class="italic">Critical Inquiry into Antient Armour</span> (1824), can be regarded as the first modern work of scholarship on this subject. Based mainly on documentary sources, it still remains a valuable work of reference for the post-conquest period. His other major contribution to the study of arms and armour was the first <span class="italic">Official Catalogue of the Tower Armouries</span> (1859), which established the system of classification of the exhibits still in use, although he also published numerous articles on this and other antiquarian subjects, mostly in the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span> and <span class="italic">The Reliquary</span>.<br>
<br>Hewitt had already engaged in literary pursuits while in Lichfield, and these he continued, under the pen-name Sylvanus Swanquill, during his time in London, where he enjoyed the friendship of a number of well-known literary figures. His verse was described as &#145;racy and descriptive, suggesting the style of the elder Hood&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Reliquary</span>, 18, 1877&#150;8, 229). He was a considerable scholar in several languages, both ancient and modern, a skilled artist, and had a wide knowledge of many subjects besides arms and armour. His publications in other fields include <span class="italic">Old Woolwich</span> (1860), handbooks to the city of Lichfield (1874) and its cathedral (1875), and a new edition of C. A. Stothard's <span class="italic">Monumental Effigies of Great Britain</span> (1876), with greatly expanded commentaries. Hewitt retired to Lichfield, where in 1873&#150;4 he served on the committee of the Lichfield Industrial Fine Art and Loan Exhibition, for which he also arranged a display of microscopes. He died in Lichfield on 10 January 1878, and was buried five days later in the cathedral close.<br>
