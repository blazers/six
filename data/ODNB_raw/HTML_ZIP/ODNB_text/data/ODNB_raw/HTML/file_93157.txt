<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scanlon,  Hugh Parr</span>, Baron Scanlon  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born in Melbourne, Australia, on 26 October 1913, the second son of Hugh Scanlon, upholsterer, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Prince. His parents had recently emigrated from Salford in Lancashire and, when his father died a year later, his mother returned to her parents' home in Davyhulme, Manchester, where she gave birth to a daughter and went to work in the local Co-operative soap factory. These family circumstances placed serious financial constraints on Scanlon's upbringing and, while attending St Mary's church school and then Stretford elementary school, he also had to work part-time delivering bread and newspapers. During these years a major influence came from his grandfather, who was active in the local Labour Party and who encouraged him to read the novels of Jack London and Upton Sinclair.<br>
<br>Scanlon left school at the age of fourteen to take up an apprenticeship as an instrument maker at the huge Metropolitan-Vickers engineering works in Trafford Park, Manchester. There he quickly acquired the reputation of being sharp-witted, outspoken, and mischievous. One often-told story records that soon after starting he found an overpayment in his wage packet, then a week later the same sum was deducted and he complained; on being told &#145;You did not complain last week when we paid you too much&#146;, he replied, &#145;One mistake I can forgive, but not two&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 28 Jan 2004). Scanlon continued his education through National Council of Labour Colleges' evening classes but took little interest in technical subjects, preferring to focus on economics, industrial psychology, public speaking, and chairmanship. He was now becoming increasingly active in the Amalgamated Engineering Union: elected as a shop steward at the age of twenty-two, he went on to become the full-time convenor and secretary of the works committee of the recently renamed Associated Electrical Industries, which was by then employing around 6000 people, or half the workforce of the world's largest industrial park. It was therefore not such a big step to become divisional organizer for the north-west region in 1947. Scanlon had also joined the Labour Party through its League of Youth but, like many others of his generation, he became increasingly disillusioned with its policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and joined the Communist Party in 1936, remaining a member until his resignation in 1954. Although this gave him a lasting reputation in right-wing and security circles as a &#145;domestic subversive&#146;, the British Communist Party had given up its revolutionary ambitions in the late 1920s and explicitly committed itself to a &#145;parliamentary road&#146; in 1951: membership in these years therefore only implied a more principled reformist socialism. Last but not least, work at the Vickers plant had also brought Scanlon into contact with a young female clerk in the meter department, Nora Kate Markey, daughter of James Markey, a steel dresser. The couple married on 29 July 1944 at Eccles register office and had two daughters.<br>
<br>The long period of economic prosperity after 1945 enabled the Amalgamated Engineering Union to expand into such new sectors as the motor industry and gradually to re-establish its earlier position of strength, which had been eroded by inter-war unemployment. Its membership grew to around one million and rediscovered its assertiveness, and its leadership began to move away from cold war anti-communism. Scanlon continued his rise to become the most credible leader of the left within the union: in 1963 he was elevated to the national executive after a highly contested election involving a lengthy court case and then, in 1967, ran a successful campaign for the position of president.<br>
<br>The election of Scanlon&#151;an avowed Marxist who retained friendly links with members of the Communist Party&#151;to the head of one of Britain's most powerful industrial organizations aroused both exaggerated fears and exaggerated hopes. For example, soon after his emergence to national prominence he gave a revealing interview to a group of young intellectuals from the <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>, who hoped to find him advocating a new form of industrial militancy to force an immediate transition to socialism. As a trade-union activist with many years of practical experience, Scanlon's response was more cautious and more concrete: he saw the new mood of rebelliousness as a product of youthful impatience and emphasized the constitutional limitations on his own power. His leftism therefore took a more traditional form, turning questions about the imminence of socialism into answers about the details of collective bargaining, and emphasizing that his presidential campaign had been about resistance to the incomes policy of Harold Wilson's Labour government. Moreover, because he realized that this particular economic demand would have immediate political implications, Scanlon was hesitant about taking industrial action and hoped for an understanding response from Labour ministers. In other respects his priorities remained the familiar ones of normal collective bargaining. Thus, in outlining his own organization's immediate strategy, he explained:<blockquote>the Engineering Wages application itself which we have just presented to the engineering employers &hellip; asks for a substantial wage increase without any strings attached&#151;in other words, without any productivity deals, with all that implies for the Prices and Incomes policy&#151;for a shorter working week, increased holidays and holiday pay, increased overtime premiums and a better guaranteed week. Together with the establishment of illness and pension benefits. (&#145;The role of militancy&#146;, <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>, 46, 1967, 7)</blockquote>Similarly, though a number of his speeches at this time resulted in Scanlon becoming closely associated with the notion of &#145;workers' control&#146;, his own understanding of this widespread catchphrase remained close to the realities of everyday trade unionism. In the foreseeable future he took it to mean the formalizing of traditional regulation of training and manning, extended to include ratification of the appointment of supervisors at shop level and scrutiny of the decisions of managers at enterprise level. Indeed, at the heart of his conception of workers' control was his own experience as a local union activist during the Second World War and the long post-war boom. Even in his more utopian sketches of a fully democratic, socialist future he still foresaw the survival of roles for technical staff and managers alongside the adversarial pressure of independent trade unions. Much of the language was new and the overall tone was perhaps more assertive, but the goals expressed by Scanlon in these speeches would have been familiar even to his radical-liberal predecessors in the leadership of the craft unions. For the core of his vision was a challenge to the parasitic power of international financiers and the creation of a co-operative atmosphere within British industry to release the full potential of the workforce:<blockquote>Fundamentally, the aim within public ownership is the wearing down of sides in industry, with no &#145;superiors&#146; or &#145;inferiors&#146; but only differences and functions based on knowledge and ability &hellip; Ideas, aspirations and intentions need to have full access and be encouraged upward, whilst explanations, snags and problems should move downward for discussion and the creation of an informed working populace. (H. Scanlon, <span class="italic">The Way Forward for Workers' Control</span>, 1968, 7)</blockquote>At the core of his identity, then, Scanlon was not a politician but a trade unionist, and not a mindless militant but a skilful negotiator. While he often referred to &#145;loyalty to the principles of socialism&#146;, what he meant in practice was more investment in up-to-date equipment and the training of the workforce. While he always followed the democratically determined policy of the union, in his retirement he was prepared to be outspoken about the damaging impact of excessive striking. It was therefore entirely consistent that he should have served on a number of joint industrial bodies, including the Engineering Industry Training Board (1975&#150;82); represented the unions on a number of regulatory bodies, including the Metrication Board (1973&#150;8) and the British Gas Corporation (1976&#150;82); and from 1978 taken part in a public inquiry into the teaching of mathematics in schools. However, there was one issue over which he could be uncompromisingly intransigent and which would cause enormous problems for both Labour and Conservative governments: resistance to state intervention in collective bargaining. It was this that prompted Wilson's well-known response, &#145;get your tanks off my lawn Hughie&#146;, issued at Chequers in June 1969  (P. Jenkin, <span class="italic">The Battle for Number Ten</span>, 1970, 140).<br>
<br>By the mid-1960s there was a cross-party consensus that the only way to deal with the rising tide of disruptive disputes in the strategic export sector of the motor industry was to impose legal controls on strike action. As a result the Labour white paper <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span>&#151;produced by Wilson's employment and productivity secretary, Barbara Castle, in January 1969&#151;proposed statutory conciliation pauses and strike ballots, thus steering a collision course with the two huge unions most likely to be affected: Scanlon's engineers (members from 1971 of the renamed Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers) and the Transport and General Workers under the equally formidable leadership of Jack Jones. Together Scanlon and Jones soon became known as &#145;the terrible twins&#146;, for under their pressure the Trades Union Congress stubbornly resisted any form of government compulsion and offered only a &#145;solemn and binding&#146; undertaking to support its member organizations in restraining unofficial strikes. This forced an embarrassed Labour government into making a dramatic U-turn over a key policy and it was subsequently defeated in the general election of 1970. Scanlon and Jones had already made it clear that they were not overly concerned about Edward Heath's new Conservative government being even more determined to impose statutory restraints. The <span class="roman">Industrial Relations Act</span> of 1971 was indeed rendered unworkable by a series of one-day protest strikes accompanied by the refusal of both the engineers and the transport workers to pay any attention to the provisions of the legislation, despite substantial fines imposed for contempt of court. The number of days lost through strikes rose to over 24 million in 1972, the highest annual figure since the general strike of 1926, and the act was eventually withdrawn as a dead letter.<br>
<br>The principles Scanlon was defending were moderate ones, for free collective bargaining or &#145;voluntarism&#146; had been enshrined as the traditional British approach to industrial relations in two major rounds of Liberal legislation in 1871 and 1906, and had been restated by a recent royal commission under Lord Donovan set up by Wilson himself. However, the methods used in the defence of these principles were a major departure from traditional trade-union respect for the rule of law and the parliamentary process. Scanlon may not have been in favour of a revolution himself, but he helped to provoke one. Buoyed up by the rediscovered strength of his organization, he made a major contribution to the widespread public feeling that trade unions were making the country ungovernable, and thus paved the way for Margaret Thatcher's eventual reversal of all the established assumptions about government non-intervention in this field. Scanlon repaired his relationship with the Labour leadership when it ejected Heath in 1974, repealed the Conservatives' first attempt at compulsory labour legislation, and replaced its own earlier attempt at an incomes policy with the new approach of a &#145;social contract&#146; under which the unions accepted the need for wage restraint in return for favourable government social policy.<br>
<br>On his retirement Scanlon was offered and accepted a peerage, as Baron Scanlon, on 30 December 1978: only one of many aspects of his behaviour that contemporaries found surprising. For example, while still a prominent leader of the left and living in union accommodation in Eltham, he bought a house of his own at Broadstairs on the Kent coast and made no secret of his passion for golf, which he played off the relatively low handicap of nine. On the public stage he was usually sharp and tough, but in private he could be charming and witty, and was well liked by both sides of industry. However, these characteristics only seemed paradoxical because of a misunderstanding about the politics of the British Communist Party and a lack of awareness of the diversity of the country's industrial organizations: they fall into place once Hugh Scanlon is seen as an important figure in the mainstream tradition of British craft unionism. After a long retirement he died of arteriosclerosis at his home, 23 Seven Stones Drive, Broadstairs, on 27 January 2004. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
