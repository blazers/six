<span class="headword">Bingham,  Richard, the elder</span>  (1765&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 1 April 1765. He was son of the Revd Isaac Moody Bingham, rector of Birchanger and Runwell, Essex, and great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2410/', "Joseph Bingham (bap. 1668, d. 1723)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Origines ecclesiasticae</span>. He was educated at Winchester College, where he was on the foundation, and at New College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 19 October 1787 and BCL on 18 July 1801. He was married at Bristol to Lydia Mary Anne, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7878/', "Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Douglas, baronet")</script>, and his second wife, Sarah, daughter of John Wood, on 10 November 1788, by which time he was a fellow of his college and in holy orders. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2416/', "Richard Bingham (1798&#150;1872)")</script> was their son.<br>
<br>In 1790 Bingham was appointed to the perpetual curacy of Holy Trinity Church, Gosport; in 1796 he became vicar of Great Hale, near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, and was appointed, on 22 July 1807, in succession to his father, to the prebendal stall of Bargham in Chichester Cathedral, which position he held until his death. In 1813, being then a magistrate for Hampshire of twelve years' standing, he was convicted at the Winchester summer assizes of having illegally obtained a licence for a public house, when no such public house was in existence, and of having stated a false consideration in the conveyance of the house with intent to defraud the revenue by evading an additional stamp duty of &pound;10. On 10 November 1813 a motion was made in the king's bench for a new trial. In spite of many affidavits to his character he was sentenced on 26 November 1813 to six months' imprisonment in the county gaol at Winchester. In an appeal to public opinion dated 23 December 1813 Bingham vehemently asserted his innocence.<br>
<br>In 1829 Bingham published, by subscription, the third edition of the <span class="italic">Origines ecclesiasticae</span> of his ancestor, adding references from the author's manuscript annotations in a private copy of his own book, and Joseph Bingham's three <span class="italic">Trinity Sermons</span>; he prefixed the edition with a life of Joseph Bingham. The bankruptcy of the printer while the work was passing through the press caused much delay in its distribution. Bingham died at his home at Newhouse, Gosport, on Sunday 18 July 1858, and was buried on Tuesday 27 July in the vaults of Trinity Church in the presence of a very large number of his friends and parishioners.<br>
