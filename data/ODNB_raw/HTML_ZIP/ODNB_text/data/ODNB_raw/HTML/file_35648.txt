<span class="headword">Rae,  William Fraser</span>  (1835&#150;1905), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 3 March 1835, the elder son of George Rae and his wife, Catherine Fraser, both of Edinburgh. After education at Moffat Academy and at Heidelberg, where he studied German, Rae entered Lincoln's Inn as a student on 2 November 1857, and on 30 April 1861 was called to the bar. But he soon abandoned law for journalism.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1860 Rae married Sara Eliza, second daughter of James Fordati of the Isle of Man and London. About this time he edited the periodical <span class="italic">The Reader</span>, and joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> as a special correspondent in Canada and the United States. He was in complete sympathy with the Liberal views of that paper. He published books on Canada and other subjects.<br>
<br>Throat trouble led Rae to spend much time at Austrian health resorts, where he wrote articles about them for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which were reprinted as <span class="italic">Austrian Health Resorts, and the Bitter Waters of Hungary</span> (1888). In <span class="italic">The Business of Travel</span> (1891) he described the methods of Thomas Cook &amp; Son.<br>
<br>Rae was particularly interested in eighteenth-century English political history. In 1874 he brought out <span class="italic">Wilkes, Sheridan, and Fox, or, The Opposition under George III</span>, which echoed the style of Macaulay. He studied the question of the identity of Junius, on which he wrote in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (between 11 August 1888 and 6 May 1899, and occasionally later). He bolstered the argument that Junius was not Sir Philip Francis. He was never able to identify Junius, but eliminated many possible candidates from consideration. He also made a careful study of the career of Sheridan. With the aid of Lord Dufferin and others, he collected much unpublished material and sought to rehabilitate Sheridan's reputation. This resulted in <span class="italic">Sheridan, a Biography</span> (2 vols., 1896). Rae succeeded in proving many rumours false, but failed in his purpose of whitewashing Sheridan. In 1902 he published from the original manuscripts <span class="italic">Sheridan's Plays, now Printed as he Wrote them</span> and <span class="italic">A Journey to Bath</span>, a previously unpublished comedy by Sheridan's mother. He also wrote four three-volume novels (published between 1887 and 1891).<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Rae reviewed much for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, whose editor, Norman MacColl, was a close friend. He spent his time chiefly at the Reform Club, which he had joined in 1860, and where he was chairman of the library committee from 1873 until his death. He was an occasional contributor to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Chronic ill health and his declining popularity tended somewhat to sour his last years. Sara died at Franzensbad, where she and Rae were frequent autumn visitors, on 29 August 1902, leaving two daughters. Rae died on 22 January 1905 at his residence, 13 South Parade, Bath, and was buried at Bath.<br>
