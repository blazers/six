<span class="headword">Vaughan,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1719), <span class="occ">merchant and colonial official</span>, was baptized on 3 January 1640, probably in Wales, the first of three children of George Vaughan (<i>bap</i>. 1615, <i>d</i>. 1699) and Mary Boxall (<i>d</i>. 1645). His paternal grandfather was Sir Roger Vaughan, a member of the minor Glamorgan gentry. He was living at an early age in London, the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir Josiah Child, a prominent and wealthy London merchant, who made a fortune supplying the navy and later virtually ruled the East India Company. Vaughan was sent to New England as a representative of the merchant house to investigate the prospects of the lumber trade which had been boosted by the demand generated by the Anglo-Dutch wars. He had arrived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by 1666. He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1690), the daughter of Richard Cutt, in 1668 and became a partner in the Cutt fishery trade, which he inherited after Cutt's death in 1676.<br>
<br>By the 1680s Vaughan was a leading merchant and politician in Portsmouth and remained so until his death. In the charter granted by Charles II constituting New Hampshire as a separate province from Massachusetts, he was named as one of the councillors of the new royal colony. The royal governor was attempting to make the Piscataqua region a model for the effective implementation of trade regulations. Vaughan and other traders used their political and commercial influence to undermine the royal governor and acted as if the region was a free port. When an official tried to search a vessel owned by him, the infuriated Vaughan beat him so badly with a cane that it took him several months to recover. In 1683 he was deprived of his seat on the council. Vaughan spent nine months in prison in 1684 for gathering dispositions, signed by nearly half of the adult male population, complaining that the proprietary government threatened total ruin to New Hampshire. In July 1684 the privy council ordered a full investigation and the governor was removed from office; the evidence provided by Vaughan from prison to the agent in London had helped the case, but the continuing support of Sir Josiah Child was perhaps more crucial. Vaughan was part of a group that tended to think and act in terms of New England looking to Boston as their capital, supporting the position of Congregationalism, liberty, hard money, and property against those who saw New Hampshire as an independent beachhead of royal authority in New England. As well as a commission in the militia, Vaughan held a succession of offices in the province: he was a justice of the common pleas from 1680 to 1686, and, reappointed to the council in 1692, he continued to be a member until 1698. For a brief period in the 1690s Vaughan and a few others assumed total executive control in New Hampshire. From 1706 to 1715 he was the president of the council and at the same time chief justice of the superior court. He died at Portsmouth on 12 November 1719. The Vaughans continued to be one of the leading families of New Hampshire as exemplified by his son George, who became lieutenant-governor in 1715.<br>
