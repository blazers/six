<span class="headword">Lacy,  Francis Anthony</span>, styled Count de Lacy  (1731&#150;1792), <span class="occ">army officer and diplomatist in the Spanish service</span>, was born in Spain, the second son of Patrick Lacy, an army officer in the Spanish service, and his wife, a daughter of the marquis d'Abbeville (Osly). Lacy's father, from Bruree, co. Limerick, had left Ireland with James II in 1691 and took military service in France and then Spain.<br>
<br>In 1747 Lacy joined the Spanish army as an ensign with the Irish regiment of Ultonia&#151;the Lacys' chosen corps of service. The regiment served with the Irish brigade in the campaign in Italy of that year against the Austrians in support of Spanish claims to the crowns of Naples and Sicily and the duchy of Milan. In 1762, aged thirty-one, he was promoted colonel of the regiment, which served with the Irish brigade in the war against Portugal; it captured the frontier fortress of Miranda do Douro and occupied Braganza and Chaves, before retiring across the frontier to Extremadura with the rest of the Spanish army.<br>
<br>Lacy then turned to diplomacy, and served as the Spanish minister at the courts of Stockholm and St Petersburg. From Russia he wrote a series of reports to the Marquess Grimaldi between 1772 and 1775 concerning the Russian expedition to Kamchatka and drawing attention to Russian interest in the northern coast of California. This led the Spanish government to send a rival expedition to the coast of Kamchatka, to establish relations with local tribes.<br>
<br>Upon his return Lacy was made commandant-general of the coast of Granada, member of the supreme war council, and inspector-general of artillery and ordnance establishments (1780). He was responsible for improved discipline at the school of artillery in Segovia and for the introduction of classes for chemistry, mineralogy, and pyrotechnics. As lieutenant-general he commanded the artillery at the siege of Minorca in 1781, where the British defenders held out for six months. Thereafter he commanded the Spanish artillery at the unsuccessful siege of Gibraltar, which lasted until 1783. For his services Lacy was granted the grand cross of Charles III and the rank of commander of the cross of St Iago. He was also made titular of the rich commanderie of Las Cazas Buenas, Merida.<br>
<br>In March 1789 Lacy was appointed governor and captain-general of Catalonia, where he worked hard to prevent the spread of French revolutionary doctrines among the Catalans. He died, unmarried, at Barcelona on 31 December 1792, at the age of sixty-one, and was buried in January 1793 at the parish church of Santa Maria del Mar in the city. His success, according to James Grant, in his book <span class="italic">Cavaliers of Fortune</span> (1859), owed less to military talent and more to an imposing stature, a ready wit, and a steadfast loyalty to the court he served.<br>
<br>Lacy's elder brother, Patrick, who also joined the Ultonia regiment, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, married a lady from Cork, with whom he had three children. Among these was Louis de Lacy (1775&#150;1817), who enjoyed a distinguished military career in Spain under the Bourbons, the Napoleonic regime, and then again the Bourbons, only to be executed for rising in defence of the 1812 constitution.<br>
