<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  William  Reardon</span>, first baronet  (1856&#150;1935), <span class="occ">shipowner and philanthropist</span>, was born at Appledore, Devon, on 7 August 1856, the youngest of nine children of Thomas Smith (1810&#150;1859), master of the schooner <i>Hazard</i>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1906), the daughter of Captain Phillip Green. His mother was widowed after the <i>Hazard</i> sank during a storm in the Burry estuary on 31 October 1859. After a basic education at the Wesleyan Methodist day school, Smith left Appledore as deck-boy and cook in the coasting smack <i>Unity</i> on 6 September 1870. He undertook his first deep-sea voyage in the <i>Ocean Pearl</i> from Newport, Monmouthshire, to New Orleans with a cargo of rails in 1872, followed by a voyage in the Swansea copper ore trade to Chile in the <i>Scout</i> in 1872&#150;3. He spent much of 1875 on Prince Edward Island, Canada, rigging wooden sailing vessels under construction for the Yeo family, who had extensive business interests on the island as well as owning the Richmond dry dock in Appledore.<br>
<br>After studying briefly at a Leith nautical academy Smith obtained his second mate's certificate on 11 August 1876. Just seven months later he obtained his first mate's certificate after studying at the Plymouth Navigation School and he then joined the noted Scottish shipowners Hugh Hogarth &amp; Sons of Ardrossan, with whom he remained for the next eighteen years. Having obtained his master's certificate (again at Plymouth) in June 1879, he went on to command some of Hogarth's sailing ships trading worldwide, particularly the <i>Macrihanish</i> (1883&#150;4) and the <i>Ochtertyre</i> (1885&#150;90). He then spent a further six years in command of some of Hogarth's earliest tramp steamers before taking command of the steamer <i>Starcross</i> in November 1896; this vessel was owned by Anning Brothers of Cardiff, a family whose roots were in the village of Kenton near Exeter. The following year he assumed command of the <i>Lady Lewis</i>, owned by a Cardiff company established by a fellow native of Appledore, William James Tatem. He commanded another Tatem vessel, the <i>Shandon</i>, before retiring from active seafaring in 1900, in which year he and his family moved from Appledore to settle in Cardiff.<br>
<br>Smith had married, on 16 May 1880, Ellen Hamlyn (1857&#150;1939) of Appledore. A year younger than her husband, she was the daughter of Thomas Hamlyn, a coal merchant with numerous interests in local shipping, and his wife, Elizabeth, who ran a grocery shop and bakery in Market Street. The Smiths had three sons and four daughters; their eldest son died of hydrocephalus in 1883, aged just sixteen months. Ellen inherited her parents' business acumen in no small measure, and her diligent management of financial assets was crucial to the establishment of the family business in 1905&#150;6.<br>
<br>Smith made some investments in property in Cardiff before his first venture into shipowning in 1904, in partnership with the Cardiff chandler William Seager; together they set up the Tempus Shipping Co. Ltd to acquire the new steamship of that name, completed at Stockton-on-Tees in that year. The partnership proved short-lived, however; within a year Smith had resigned to initiate the shipping venture that would become his life's work. On 19 May 1905 he set up a new company, the Instow Steamship Co. Ltd, and placed an order with the Teesside shipbuilder Ropner's for a new steamship to be named <i>City of Cardiff</i>; almost all the family's assets were sunk into this firm. Smith only just managed to secure sufficient capital&#151;much of it from the West Riding of Yorkshire and industrial Lancashire&#151;to ensure the delivery of the new ship on 17 March 1906. However, her first voyage to La Plata in Argentina with coal, returning with grain to Genoa&#151;a typical &#145;coal out, grain home&#146; voyage of the time&#151;was a resounding commercial success and laid the basis for the venture's subsequent expansion.<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Smith established three further shipping companies which again relied upon capital from the north of England and also from the St Just area of industrial Cornwall; in 1914 these companies owned a total of nine steamers, all six or less years old. A further twelve vessels were acquired during the hostilities, but ten vessels were lost to enemy action. After the war he was created a baronet, of Appledore, Devon, on 1 July 1920, &#145;for public and local services&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 4 June 1920, 6314).<br>
<br>Buoyed up by the immediate post-war boom and feeling sure that improved trading conditions would continue into the 1920s, Smith created four new companies between 1919 and 1921 for which he ordered new tonnage at vastly inflated prices, as well as purchasing former German merchant tonnage surrendered to the allies after the war. The collapse of the boom in the late spring of 1920 caught him unawares, however; he was later forced to wind up one of the post-war companies, the Cornborough Line Ltd, in a state of insolvency in 1923 and thereafter pursued a more cautious course in his shipping activities.<br>
<br>Despite the economic difficulties of the period, Reardon Smith (as he became publicly known in this period) emerged as a considerable philanthropist during the 1920s; this doubtless stemmed from the fact that he had known hardship and poverty as a child following the loss of his father. In 1916 he had contributed 10,000 guineas to the King Edward VII Hospital (later the Cardiff Royal Infirmary) in Cardiff and he also contributed about a half of the &pound;5000 raised to build a new cottage hospital at Bideford, which he himself opened in September 1925. Education was another cause close to his heart. In September 1920 he initiated a fund-raising campaign among his fellow shipowners at Cardiff which raised &pound;18,000 to fund the Smith Junior Nautical School, later the Reardon Smith Nautical School. Opened on 3 October 1921, it provided an appropriate three-year curriculum for boys in their early teens who had their sights set upon a career as deck officers, teaching navigation and business practice alongside practical subjects such as boat-handling or ropework. The facilities available to boys at the school were enhanced considerably in February 1925 with the purchase by Reardon Smith of the substantial schooner-rigged steel yacht <i>Margherita</i>, which served as both cadet training vessel and family yacht until 1932. In 1926 he also endowed the chair of geography at Exeter University and established three scholarships at the university for students from north Devon.<br>
<br>The philanthropic cause with which Reardon Smith was most closely associated, however, was the National Museum of Wales. Despite being a proud Devonian (he was a pillar and sometime president of the Cardiff Devonshire Society), he was a dynamic and tireless officer (as council member, treasurer, and president) of the museum from 1921 until 1933. The museum was in severe financial difficulties in the 1920s and construction work on the building in Cathays Park, Cardiff, was at a standstill. Reardon Smith was appointed treasurer in 1925 and within days of his appointment called in to see the director, Mortimer Wheeler (they subsequently became firm friends). Having ascertained that the museum had an overdraft of exactly &pound;21,367 4<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., he instantly wrote out a cheque for that sum and initiated a vigorous fund-raising campaign with a target of &pound;100,000 to complete the museum's eastern wing. He succeeded to the presidency in 1928, and his successful term of office came to a conclusion in October 1932 with the opening of the museum's new wing by Prince George; apart from gallery space, the wing also comprised a lecture theatre named in Reardon Smith's honour.<br>
<br>Alongside his philanthropic activities, Reardon Smith continued to run what was by the late 1920s one of the UK's biggest tramp shipping companies, owning some thirty-five vessels. The shipping market remained sluggish throughout the inter-war years and he worked hard with his fellow directors (two sons and three sons-in-law) to improve the economy and flexibility of the vessels that he ordered from shipyards in the north-east of England, Belfast, and the Clyde. From 1922 onwards all new steamships supplied to the company were capable of burning either coal or oil in their fireboxes and in 1928 he ordered his first two motor vessels, taking delivery of a further four such vessels during his lifetime. These motor vessels soon proved their worth on a new cargo liner service initiated in the spring of 1928 to the Pacific coast of Canada and the USA. But even Reardon Smith could not avoid the worst of the post-Wall Street crash recession&#151;in June 1933 a third of the fleet was laid up on the River Fal and in Milford Haven. Despite the economic difficulties of the period, however, Reardon Smith&#151;a lifelong Liberal&#151;remained a firm adherent of <i>laissez-faire</i> economics and was an opponent of the notion of governmental assistance for the tramp shipping sector, which was under discussion in the early 1930s.<br>
<br>Having forged such an outstanding career himself, Reardon Smith was a tough employer; an office boy who started working for the company in the early 1930s recalled being rebuked by him for using the lift, rather than the stairs, at Merthyr House, the company's Cardiff dockland office. While expecting total commitment from those who worked for him, both at sea and ashore, he repaid that commitment in many ways, not least with the introduction of company pension schemes. Unlike many major shipowners, he did not seek to acquire a landed estate and was content with a large and comfortable residence in a Cardiff suburb. Loath to spend the proceeds of his enterprise on his own indulgence, he supported hospitals, schools, universities, religious causes, and above all the National Museum of Wales, to which he gave a total of some &pound;50,000.<br>
<br>Reardon Smith died at his home, Cornborough, Ty Gwyn Road, Penylan, Cardiff, on 23 December 1935. After a service at the Roath Park Wesleyan Methodist Church (where the family worshipped), he was interred in the Cathays cemetery on 27 December. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest surviving son, Willie (1887&#150;1950), who in 1929 had assumed the surname Reardon-Smith in lieu of Smith.<br>
