<span class="headword">Barratt,  (Arthur) William</span>  (1877&#150;1939), <span class="occ">shoe manufacturer and retailer</span>, was born on 8 October 1877 in Ethel Street, Northampton, the fourth of seven sons of John Barratt, a shoemaker, and Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yeomans. William Barratt, as he was always known, came from a working-class background, and after attending the local elementary school he worked as a shop assistant selling shoes in Northampton and London. The poor conditions he experienced encouraged his socialist convictions. In 1899 he married Alice Johnson, who survived him until 1958. They had two daughters by adoption. On return to Northampton he became a prominent member of the local Social Democratic Federation, which had growing influence in a town where the industry was subject to considerable technical change. As a local socialist council candidate he just failed to get elected.<br>
<br>In 1902 Barratt went into partnership with his brother to sell shoes in a local shop. Another brother made a chance purchase of a stock of boots which he then tried to sell by post. This alerted William Barratt to the potential of a mail-order business but financial difficulties led to the original partnership going bankrupt in 1906. However, the potential of the mail-order business was clear, exploiting as it did the possibility of selling in rural areas and more remote villages and towns. With the help of a Rushden shoe manufacturer, Barratt recommenced business and quickly began to make a more permanent mark in the shoe trade. W. Barratt &amp; Co. was created as a limited liability company in 1907. In 1913 Barratt opened his large Footshape works in Northampton and in 1914 the first retail outlet in London of what was to become a major retailing chain. The rapid development of the firm was assisted by the boom conditions of government orders in the First World War, but continued into the post-war period through the combination of worldwide mail-order sales and urban retail outlets, of which there were 150 at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Barratt's standing in the shoe trade was founded on his general business acumen and a reputation for quality. The mail-order service gave the firm international renown, since wherever the post went so too could Barratt's shoes. Barratt pioneered his own personal advertising style in many different languages, marketing both the product and himself as the guarantee of quality. His motto was that he who has good goods to sell should shout, not whisper down a well. He believed that business organization should display &#145;the individual touch&#146; and cultivated an image of himself as a man of the people. However, although Barratt played a decisive entrepreneurial role, a number of his brothers and others also made important contributions to the success of the company.<br>
<br>Barratt was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Labour in the Bethnal Green constituency in 1931. In Northampton he succeeded in being elected to the town council between 1929 and 1934 as a Labour Party member, but then resigned in protest against what he saw as the unbusinesslike character of local government. This was typical of someone who was strong-willed and something of a loner. In 1933 he became president of the Northampton Town Boot and Shoe Manufacturers Association, but created controversy by urging a shorter working week for workers in the shoe industry.<br>
<br>Barratt's local interests involved the support of many sporting groups, including the Northampton &#145;Saints&#146; rugby club. As a young man he participated enthusiastically in many sporting activities, including early motorcycle racing. With his wife he made a major contribution to Northampton by financing a modern maternity home to check maternal mortality and suffering, thus relieving some of the contradiction that he felt between his wealth and his political and social views. Together they spent between &pound;50,000 and &pound;60,000 on the home.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Barratt developed W. Barratt &amp; Co. into one of the leading shoe manufacturing and retailing firms in inter-war Britain, with over 2000 employees. He died on 8 December 1939 at St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, two weeks after having suffered a nervous breakdown. He was cremated, and his ashes scattered on his brother Richard's grave at Kingsthorpe cemetery, Northampton, on 12 December.<br>
