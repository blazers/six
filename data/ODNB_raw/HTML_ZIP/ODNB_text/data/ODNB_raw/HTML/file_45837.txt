<span class="headword">Campbell,  Dorothea Primrose</span>  (1792&#150;1863), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born on 4 May 1792 in the Shetland Islands (perhaps at Laxfirth), the eldest of the many children of Duncan Campbell, a surgeon, and Elizabeth Campbell. Her grandfather had left the family heavily indebted. At sixteen, after her father's death, she approached the Inverness publisher J. Young, timidly hoping to make money from her poems. Young published her first volume, <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1811), by subscription, for her sole benefit. The title page bears her full name and a couplet from James Thomson. The poems are remarkably accomplished for her age, encompassing imaginary and actual material and celebrating local scenery and legends. Francis Jeffrey found much promise and originality in them. Campbell's expressed attitudes to Shetland are ambivalent: there is on the one hand delight and pride, on the other a longing for wider horizons.<br>
<br>A teacher by 1812, Campbell opened her own school at Lerwick in 1813. In 1816 she published a second edition of <span class="italic">Poems</span>, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, with whom she corresponded. This work reflects a new melancholy, dwelling on death, on farewell to childhood scenes, and on insults heaped on poverty. She reprinted most of her earlier poems, identifying &#145;To the Evening Star&#146; as written in 1803. Her subscription list ranges from London to Lerwick; Scott took four copies. Her introduction mentions her father's misfortunes and early death, but the publisher's bankruptcy dashed any hopes of profit. Campbell kept teaching after her own school foundered as a result of her illness and her mother's opium addiction.<br>
<br>For Campbell's last known publishing venture she assumed an air of proud indifference. Her novel, <span class="italic">Harley Radington: a Tale</span>, was published in 1821 by A. K. Newman; her payment consisted of twenty free copies. She drew both on canonical authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Goldsmith, and on recent, little-known women writers whose experience paralleled her own: the Scotswoman and teacher Anne Bannerman, the Englishwoman and traveller Eliza Fay, and Margaret Chalmers, who preceded Campbell as a distinguished Shetland poet admired by Scott, and who shared many of her subscribers.<br>
<br>Campbell's novel is a &#145;national tale&#146; which deserves consideration with those of Scott and others. She supplied it with footnotes and a glossary on the life, customs, and superstitions of Zetland (Shetland), where most of it is set. Her narrator, Harley, grows up in fashionable London, not knowing (though clues are dropped) that his mother is a &#145;female adventurer&#146; whose humble Shetland origins are her guilty secret. The rest of the plot is upstaged by his exploration of his roots, rendered colourfully and humorously during his period of dumbfounded revulsion, lyrically as he discovers a wider Shetland life of landscape, culture, and economic problems. Campbell's accounts of folk customs and beliefs&#151;such as women raising a storm to wreck a ship&#151;are particularly striking.<br>
<br>Newman thought well enough of <span class="italic">Harley Radington</span> to promise Campbell cash for another novel. It seems she never wrote this, though she may have contributed to magazines. She impressed the Methodist preacher and scholar Adam Clarke when he visited Shetland in 1826, and remained his correspondent.<br>
<br>Campbell's earnings from teaching paid for a younger brother's education and supported her mother's old age, but she could never save a penny. In 1841 she was invited to England by descendants of Clarke, who then went bankrupt and could not employ her according to promise. She applied for jobs first as teacher, then as matron of a public institution, as housekeeper, or &#145;even&#146; as &#145;Sister in one of the Hospitals&#146;, but English employers looked askance at her age and origins. In 1844 she had not worked for a year and was destitute in London. She applied for help to the Royal Literary Fund: humbly, on grounds of need, though her referees, Jeffrey and the traveller and medical writer James Copland, stressed her literary merit. A grant of &pound;30 enabled her to take up a teaching job at Sevenoaks, Kent. She died on 6 January 1863 at an Aged Governesses' Asylum in Kentish Town, London.<br>
