<span class="headword">Innes,  Ralph Hammond</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Hammond Innes, Ralph Hammond]</span>  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 15 July 1913 at 68 Clarence Road, Horsham, Sussex, the only child of William Hammond Innes, a bank clerk, and his wife, Dora Beatrice Chisford. Ralph went to Cranbrook School, and by the age of thirteen he knew he wanted to be a writer.<br>
<br>Innes left Cranbrook at eighteen, and tried a number of jobs in the early 1930s including teaching and publishing before joining the staff of the <span class="italic">Financial News</span> in 1934 as a trainee industrial correspondent. He stayed at the paper for the next six years. Wanting to raise some money in order to get married, he sent off a manuscript of a supernatural thriller to an agent (<span class="italic">The Doppelganger</span>, published in 1937), and was soon committed to producing three more thrillers in two years for Herbert Jenkins, with lower than usual advances. He met these arduous terms, though he later disowned these works, describing them as &#145;ham-fisted&#146;. He did, however, acknowledge that the experience had been valuable: &#145;writing those four books I more or less taught myself how to do it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Innes married the actress, and later author, Dorothy Mary Lang (<i>d</i>. 1989) in Jevington, Sussex, on 21 August 1937.<br>
<br>Once he had worked out this first contract, Innes switched publishers, moving to Collins. He continued to write at a furious pace, and produced three more thrillers in the next two years. The first of these, <span class="italic">Wreckers must Breathe</span> (1940)&#151;a story of U-boats operating out of Cornwall&#151;met with considerable success. The third book for Collins, <span class="italic">Attack Alarm</span> (1941), was written largely during night watches defending an aerodrome during the battle of Britain. The book was serialized in an American newspaper, and has been credited with improving the image of Britain at this delicate stage in the Second World War.<br>
<br>Innes had volunteered for the Royal Artillery in 1940, served with the Eighth Army in the Middle East and Italy, and then transferred to the British army newspapers. By the end of the war he was editing the Florence edition of the forces' paper, and covering the invasion of southern France. After the war he left journalism to become a full-time writer. From then on he published a novel roughly every two years. <span class="italic">The Lonely Skier</span> (1947), a novel inspired by a gruelling skiing course taken just before he left the army, brought him to some prominence, and it was his first to be made into a film: <span class="italic">Snowbound</span> (1948). However, it was with <span class="italic">The &#145;Mary Deare&#146;</span> (1956) that Innes secured his long-held status as a best-selling author. A film of the book, starring Gary Cooper, Charlton Heston, and Michael Redgrave, was made in 1959 and was a tremendous success. Several more films of Innes's books followed, including <span class="italic">Campbell's Kingdom</span> (1952) starring Dirk Bogarde. In his heyday, in the 1950s and 1960s, Innes was selling more than 2 million copies of each book.<br>
<br>Innes's books are set in far-flung locations: from the western isles to Antarctica, the Indian Ocean, and the Australian outback. Each book was carefully researched. He never wrote about a place without having been there, and he and Dorothy&#151;both compulsive travellers, and with no children to tie them down&#151;spent months sailing around the world on these research trips in their 42 foot yacht the <i>Mary Deare</i>. His books fall into a familiar pattern. They are fast-moving adventure stories&#151;Innes himself rejected the term &#145;thriller&#146;&#151;with a first-person male narrator, and stories of high action, played out against the hostile elements. He saw himself as one of the &#145;last romantics&#146; in the tradition of Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Rudyard Kipling. He valued the wide expanse of their tales, which countered the provincialism, as he saw it, of England after the war. Critics have often found the novels' characterization wanting, and the dialogue rather flat. Praise for his work tended to be of the faint variety (the common fate of popular literature)&#151;for his workmanlike and unpretentious style. He did, however, maintain his commercial popularity over the length of his career, and V. S. Pritchett thought his depiction of action in a class of its own. His adventures have been translated into over forty languages.<br>
<br>Innes once described the theme of his books as being &#145;man's everlasting struggle against the enormous stature of nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), and this passion evolved into a strong ecological theme in his later works, from <span class="italic">Black Tide</span> (1982), about oil spillage, and <span class="italic">High Stand</span> (1985), his &#145;tree&#146; novel. With the profits from his early successes Innes had bought a medieval timbered house: Ayres End, in Kersey, Suffolk, and with it 233 acres of derelict woodland. He restored this, and went on to buy and reforest land in Wales and Australia, planting, at his estimation, about one and a half million trees.<br>
<br>In addition to his adventure novels, Innes wrote children's books under the pseudonym Ralph Hammond, and a number of non-fiction works, including two books of travels and a history of the conquistadors. He was appointed CBE in 1978, and was a member of the Society of Authors, the Royal Yacht Squadron, and the Timber Growers' Association. He was a dapper man, described by one interviewer in 1996 as a model of old-world courtesy and correctness. Innes died of cancer at Ayres End on 10 June 1998. He had amassed a fortune of nearly &pound;7 million from his books; he left &pound;5.4 million to the Association of Sea Training Organizations.<br>
