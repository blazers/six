<span class="headword">Yorke,  Philip James</span>  (1799&#150;1874), <span class="occ">chemist and mineralogist</span>, was born at Ely, Cambridgeshire, on 13 October 1799, the eldest son of Philip Yorke, prebendary of Ely (1770&#150;1817), and his wife, the Hon. Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of Charles Cocks, first Baron Somers. He was great-grandson on his father's side of the first earl of Hardwicke. He had two younger brothers and six sisters. Educated from about the age of nine at Dr Pearson's school at East Sheen, Surrey, he entered Harrow School in 1810. On leaving Harrow he obtained a commission in the Scots Fusilier Guards (5 May 1814), and remained in that regiment until he sold out on 5 November 1847 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1852 he was appointed colonel of the Herefordshire militia&#151;a post which he held during the Crimean War and until 1859.<br>
<br>A keen amateur chemist and mineralogist, Yorke was one of the founder members of the Chemical Society of London in 1841; he was a member of council (1842&#150;3), later became vice-president, and was president in 1853&#150;5. He married, on 27 April 1843, Emily (<i>b</i>. 1814?, <i>d</i>. 1868), youngest daughter of William Morgan Clifford of Perrystone, Herefordshire; there were no children of the marriage. Living in London by 1834 at the latest, Yorke came into contact with many leading scientists of the time. In 1849 he was elected FRS. He was also active at the Royal Institution, of which he was a manager.<br>
<br>Yorke's first scientific paper, published in 1834, contained a very careful investigation of the action of lead on water. It showed him to be a skilful chemical analyst. He found among other things that, after long contact with metallic lead, water dissolves one twelve-thousandth part of its own weight of a hydrated oxide of lead (formed by the action of the water and the oxygen dissolved in it). Among the thirteen papers by Yorke listed in the Royal Society catalogue, the most important was a study of the sulphides of sodium and potassium (1849). Other chemical papers were on the brown ore of iron (hydrated ferric oxide) and the quantity of caesium in the water of the hot spring at the Wheal Clifford copper mine in Cornwall. His researches on silica and silicic acid, though inconclusive, suggested the existence of a tetrabasic silicic acid.<br>
<br>Yorke also made some interesting meteorological observations on the climate of Herefordshire, including a laborious comparison of barometric readings at his house near Ross with those taken at the Royal Society during the same period. He also attempted to determine the relationship between wind direction and barometric pressure. In 1853 he published a translation of <span class="italic">Aus meinem Leben</span> by the German general and military historian Baron F. C. F. von M&uuml;ffling.<br>
<br>Yorke died at 89 Eaton Place, Pimlico, London, on 14 December 1874, and was buried in London. His death was followed, two days later at the same address, by that of his younger, unmarried sister, Juliana Caroline.<br>
