<span class="headword">Ham,  Elizabeth</span>  (1783&#150;1859), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 30 November 1783 in the village of North Perrott, Somerset, on the border with Dorset, the third of the seven children of Thomas Ham, a yeoman farmer and brewer, and his slightly older wife, Elizabeth, who was also, perhaps, of rather higher social standing. Some eighteen months later, at the time of her mother's next pregnancy, Elizabeth lived with various relatives in the neighbourhood and was taken home from time to time. Her own family came together later at Dorchester, Weymouth, and several villages between the two towns and to the west of them. Elizabeth had spells of schooling near home and, for a short time, at an unsatisfactory boarding-school at Tiverton in Devon. Part of her youth coincided with George III's summer visits to Weymouth during the wars with Napoleon when troops and seamen thronged the towns, and for Elizabeth life became a round of plays, balls, parties, fireworks, regattas, and reviews.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's father decided to move to Ireland and on 3 November 1804 he and Elizabeth set out for Milford Haven in Wales and from there by boat to Waterford. Their first winter in Ireland was spent in Carlow, and in March 1805 the family began a roundabout journey taking them to Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick, Ennis, Galway, Castlebar, and eventually Ballina in co. Mayo. There Thomas Ham hoped to make his fortune from cheap grain, and set up malting businesses to supply a brewery in Guernsey. Elizabeth deliberately recorded her impressions of the state of Irish society at the time, including the conditions of the Irish poor, whom she none the less admired. However, party-going and dancing among the soldiery still formed a main part of her life. At Ballina she fell in love with a junior officer who, it would seem, acted in bad faith. She never married, later remarking that we &#145;live a large portion of our lives between fifteen and twenty-five&#146;  (Ham, <span class="italic">Elizabeth Ham by Herself</span>, 61). Her recollections of her time in Ireland are characterized by a late eighteenth-century appreciation of the sublime and picturesque.<br>
<br>Thomas Ham's fortunes did not mend and in 1809 Elizabeth returned to Wessex and to the realization that she no longer had a settled home. She also discovered, to her distress, that her accent had been affected by her years in Ireland. She flitted from relative to relative, serving as housekeeper, maid, or nurse as required, and without payment. She visited Guernsey again (a previous family visit had occurred before she moved to Ireland), by which time she was writing verse. Despite a long romantic interest in Napoleon, she took a leading part in the many peace celebrations in 1814 which were taking place from Blandford in eastern Dorset to Yeovil and East Coker in southern Somerset. Later she taught in a small school in Fordington, near Dorchester.<br>
<br>It was in Yeovil that Elizabeth turned to Unitarianism. Eventually, about 1820, she became the governess to the household of the poet and patron Charles Elton&#151;then also a Unitarian&#151;of Clifton, Bristol, where she was, at last, treated as one of a large family of &#145;gentlefolks&#146;. <span class="italic">An Infant's Grammar</span> (1820?) was published, and Elton helped her with a long narrative poem which appeared anonymously in 1824 as <span class="italic">Elgiva, or, The Monks</span>, the latter displaying a wide reading on her part.<br>
<br>After the 1820s details of Elizabeth's life are few. The last of the Elton children was born in 1825 and it is difficult to tell how long she stayed on as governess. She had a piece published anonymously in <span class="italic">The Remembrance</span>, an annual, in 1831, and allusions to Dickens and Thackeray show that she kept abreast of the times in her reading. In 1837 she was in Bath, and was in Brislington, near Bristol, in 1844. In 1845 she recalled her Irish experiences in the romance <span class="italic">The Ford Family in Ireland</span>. She referred to the thunder of Louis Jullien's quadrille band, which she could have heard in Bristol or Bath in 1850, and she was still living in Brislington in 1851 as housekeeper for a lady of property.<br>
<br>At the age of sixty-six Elizabeth began writing her recollections; she had not kept diaries and some of her dates must therefore be accepted with caution. She was still working at it in 1852, by which time she had covered the years up to about 1825. An abridgement of her recollections was published in 1945 as <span class="italic">Elizabeth Ham by herself, 1783&#150;1820</span>. Her imaginative power strongly evokes a sense of her time and yet also describes events and people from a matter-of-fact Victorian perspective. The autobiography combines propriety with engaging frankness. Elizabeth Ham died of heart disease in Brislington, at Wick House, the home of her employer, on 1 March 1859.<br>
