<span class="headword">Simms,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">businessman and Irish nationalist</span>, was baptized in Belfast on 6 June 1763, the sixth child in the family of five sons and two daughters of Robert Simms, merchant and tanner, and his wife Elizabeth Stevenson of Belfast. With his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37960/', "Robert Simms")</script> he owned a tan yard in Belfast, a paper mill in Ballyclare, and a flour mill in Crumlin. He was a member of the Third Presbyterian Congregation in Rosemary Street, a noted reformer in the 1780s, one of the founders of the Society of United Irishmen and its secretary in 1791, and a proprietor of its newspaper, the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>. His house, The Grove, on the Shore Road in Belfast, became one of the meeting-places of the society, and with his brother he subscribed heavily to its finances. In May 1794 he was tried for, and acquitted of, publishing a seditious address in the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, of which he remained a proprietor until its suppression in May 1797.<br>
<br>William Simms is overshadowed by his brother Robert but he too was a dedicated revolutionary. Indeed some thought him more active than Robert but that he escaped notice, being &#145;more artful and cunning&#146;. He was detained in Newgate prison in Dublin in 1797 but he appears to have taken little part in the 1798 rising and was not among the state prisoners incarcerated after its suppression. He does not figure in R. R. Madden's history <span class="italic">The United Irishmen, their Lives and Times</span> (7 vols., 1842&#150;6) and has been neglected in consequence. Although the government continued to think him dangerous&#151;and there are signs that he may have remained in the revamped United Irish movement during his brother's imprisonment&#151;in 1803 he advised Thomas Russell against rebellion and there is no evidence of treasonable activity thereafter.<br>
<br>Simms was married with a son and four daughters, all of whom died before the age of ten. He was named one of the managers of the Belfast Academical Institution in 1810. He died at his Belfast home on 2 August 1843 and was buried in Knockbreda.<br>
