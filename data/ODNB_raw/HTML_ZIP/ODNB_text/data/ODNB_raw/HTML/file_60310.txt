<span class="headword">Franchi,  Gregorio</span>  (1769/70&#150;1828), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born in Portugal to Loreto Franchi, an Italian singer employed at court. William Beckford met him during his stay in Portugal in 1787, when he was invited to hear the seventeen-year-old play Haydn in the Patriarchal College, and gained his father's consent (as a letter testifies) to take him back to England and to provide for the young man's future well-being. The talented and artistic youth gradually grew to be indispensable within Beckford's entourage at Fonthill, and took a leading part in furnishing the new abbey buildings, the grandest of the eighteenth-century &#145;Gothic&#146; style mansions, with paintings, tapestries, furniture, silver, and <i>objets d'art</i>. He married in Portugal in 1795, but after the birth of a daughter he left his family in Lisbon and returned to England.<br>
<br>As Beckford became a leading collector in Europe, Franchi acted as his agent, visiting auctions and salerooms in England and abroad, buying and selling on his behalf, negotiating wartime blockades, commissioning new works; he also became his artistic collaborator, designing new <i>objets d'art</i> to suit the fantasy of the &#145;Romantic interior&#146;. Franchi and Beckford corresponded daily, even while living in the same house, Beckford writing over a thousand extant letters in Italian in a racy, intimate, at times salacious style, Franchi replying in Portuguese; a selection of the letters, in translation, was published by Boyd Alexander under the title <span class="italic">Life at Fonthill, 1807&#150;1822</span>. Recent work by curators of the Victoria and Albert Museum, which bought a number of items belonging to Beckford at the Fonthill and Hamilton Palace sales in the nineteenth century, has identified a number of drawings by Beckford, or by Franchi, initialled by Beckford, that served as patterns for leading silversmiths commissioned to carry them out, as well as supporting documents. A number of examples are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and still more in Brodick Castle in Scotland, a charming small castle on Arran Island that houses some silver and other items Beckford's daughter Susan brought with her when she married the tenth duke of Hamilton in 1811 or later inherited on Beckford's death in 1844; some other items are in the National Museum of Scotland. Some of the most exquisite are small spoons with &#145;oriental&#146; or &#145;Renaissance&#146; motifs. Franchi appears to have been on good terms with Beckford's daughters, not only Susan, but also Maria Margaret, whom Beckford had turned out for making a runaway love match with Major James Orde, and he continued to work for the tenth duke, who built up his own collections. In 1797 Beckford made his last journey to Portugal, where he had arranged for the order of Christ to be bestowed on Franchi, giving him the title of chevalier. Franchi's way of bringing the best out of the craftsmen is illustrated by a comment by William Gibbs Rogers, a woodcarver:<blockquote>Mons Franchi, a man of taste. He would come into the carvers workshop with a volume of Holbein or Aldegreve, select a spoon or handle and have them executed in ivory or ebony as high as he could get talent to bring them, would watch the progress of work day by day and the question would often be &#145;if you spent another day on it could it get finer&#146;.</blockquote>As Franchi's Portuguese letters relating to the detail of the works in hand have only just been translated, we can expect to know a good deal more about his role in the joint labours of commissioning, designing, procuring, and execution.<br>
<br>At about the time of the sale of Fonthill in 1822, however, Franchi and Beckford fell out; the exact circumstances are not known, but Beckford was unforgiving. Franchi had built up his own small collection while working for Beckford, and when it was sold at the time of his death the excellent taste of the items was noted. His will, made in Rome in 1825, showed his care in recording &#145;objects of curiosity&#146; he had stored in various locations and settling any small debts. He left an annuity to his wife, and to his daughter Isabella he left that portion of his property in Portugal that belonged to him, to come to her only after the death of his wife and her mother. He also left a remembrance to Miss Catherine Hillman and Miss Randall, both of 74 Upper Berkeley Street and Portman Square, with whom he had lodged. He instructed that Beckford's letters to him be returned, and the rest destroyed. He died in early August 1828 and was buried in the cemetery of St Marylebone on 9 August, with a headstone provided by Susan, duchess of Hamilton.<br>
