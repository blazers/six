<span class="headword">O'Connell,  Daniel Charles</span>, Count O'Connell in the French nobility  (1745&#150;1833), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, the youngest surviving son of Daniel O'Connell (<i>c</i>.1701&#150;1770), landowner, and Maire O'Donoghue (<i>c</i>.1708&#150;1795) of Derrynane, co. Kerry, was born in Derrynane on 21 May 1745, though August 1747 was the date cited during much of his lifetime. There is no specific information, but the fact that as a teenager he could read and write fluently and was conversant with French, English, and Latin indicates that he received some formal education. His career of choice was soldiering and his evident intention when he set off for Europe in 1760 was to join the imperial Austrian army. However, a chance encounter in Flanders resulted in his entering the French service as a boy cadet in the royal Swedish regiment. Promoted within a few months to the rank of sub-lieutenant, he was sufficiently confident of his future by 1764 to dismiss a suggestion from his brother Maurice that he should join the Spanish service as &#145;imprudent&#146; on the grounds that it would oblige him &#145;to relinquish a sure establishment for an uncertainty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Colonel</span>, 1.83). Having seen action in the German theatre during the later phases of the Seven Years' War, O'Connell augmented his military knowledge in the winter of 1765&#150;6 in the prestigious military academy at Strasbourg, following which he was promoted above &#145;elder officers&#146;  (ibid., 1.99) to the rank of first lieutenant. This helped him to endure the seven uneventful years he spent with the royal Swedish in Alsace and his continuing dependence on financial support from home. His promotion to the rank of sous-aide-major in 1768 and, following his decision to join Lord Clare's Irish brigade in 1769, to that of aide-major represented progress, and he was posted in the early 1770s to the French East Indies. His failure to secure a regimental majority in 1773 led him to lament the lack of &#145;encouragement for merit and ability&#146;  (ibid., 1.174) in the French army, and his &#145;expectations&#146;  (ibid., 1.184) were dealt a further set-back when Clare's Irish brigade was dissolved in 1775. Made a second captain, he devoted his free time to study. His prospects in the French service seemed slim when his insightful observations on military discipline attracted official notice and resulted in his elevation to the brevet rank of colonel, and the award of the cross of St Louis and a small pension. This did not relieve him from financial dependence upon his brother, but it helped him in 1776 &#145;to decline offers seemingly very advantageous made me by the emissary of the American congress&#146;  (ibid., 1.199). He was encouraged to reach this decision by his strong sense of loyalty to France, &#145;where I early found an asylum when refused one at home&#146;  (ibid., 1.207). He demonstrated his &#145;inviolable fidelity&#146;  (ibid., 1.207) to the French king when, following the outbreak of war with Great Britain in 1778, he rejoined the royal Swedish as a lieutenant-colonel and performed heroically during the capture of Minorca and the siege of Gibraltar in 1781&#150;2. This was O'Connell's finest fighting hour, and it resulted in his promotion to the rank of colonel-commandant and the bestowal upon him of the distinction of the title count.<br>
<br>Having finally attained a measure of financial security, a noble rank that gave him an entr&eacute;e to the highest levels of French society, and a military rank that ensured him a regimental command, O'Connell seemed set fair. His preference was for active military service. He was prepared, he informed his brother in 1785, &#145;cheerfully [to] spill the last drop&#146; of his blood  (<span class="italic">Last Colonel</span>, 2.40) for Louis XVI but instead he was given the task of revising the military code. This was not complete when the country was plunged into revolution in the summer of 1789. The outbreak of the French Revolution was &#145;extreamly disadvantageous&#146; to O'Connell and others like him who &#145;held &hellip; favours from [the] Court&#146;  (ibid., 2.89). In the short term his loyalty to France enabled him to bear the loss of his pension and to ignore the invitations of aristocratic acquaintances to conspire against the revolution. His promotion to major-general in the summer of 1791 seemed to suggest he might even profit by it, when his dislike of &#145;the changes that have taken place&#146; and &#145;the state of military anarchy&#146; he observed  (ibid., 2.95) meant he would have preferred to have declined the honour. Under threat of arrest, he fled France in the summer of 1792 and joined the royalist army in Germany as a private, but by November he was in London. He managed to protect his French property from confiscation by providing a false alibi to the effect that he was in Ireland while he sized up his options. He determined to continue the struggle against the revolution, and a proposal he submitted to William Pitt in 1794 became the basis of a plan to establish an Irish brigade in the service of George III. O'Connell was appointed colonel of the 4th regiment of the proposed brigade, but administrative difficulties, some of which derived from opposition to the recruitment of Catholics in Ireland, meant that his intentions that the brigade would fight against the French were not realized.<br>
<br>At the French chapel in King Street, Covent Garden, London, in 1796 O'Connell married Martha Gourand, countess of Bellevue (<i>d</i>. 1807), despite the objections of his brother, and with this his life entered a quieter phase. He and his wife and stepchildren returned to France after the peace of Amiens, where the combination of his military income and his wife's wealth enabled him to live well. By 1813 he maintained that &#145;retirement, ease and study&#146; were his &#145;sole enjoyments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.369), but his appointment as lieutenant-general in the army of France on the restoration of the Bourbons indicated that he was not entirely without consequence. He was not to soldier again, and he devoted his time thereafter to the care and advancement of his family. Having determined in 1801 to &#145;transfer &hellip; his ambition&#146;  (ibid., 1.52) to his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20501/', "Daniel O'Connell (1775&#150;1847)")</script>, then an emerging lawyer, he proved remarkably supportive financially of his fiscally profligate namesake. He was not always comfortable with his nephew's political tactics, but his belief in the &#145;justice and policy of Catholic Emancipation&#146;  (ibid., 1.369) and his manifest pleasure at Daniel O'Connell's rising &#145;reputation&#146;  (ibid., 2.408) ensured they remained on warm terms. His loyalty to the main branch of the Bourbons prevented him from taking an oath of allegiance to Louis-Philippe in 1830 and, though he became a naturalized Frenchman in 1831, he was deprived of his military pension. He lived thereafter at the Ch&acirc;teau Bellevue at Madon, near Blois, where he died on 9 July 1833. He was buried in the village cemetery at Cond&eacute;, near Madon.<br>
