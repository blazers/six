<span class="headword">Blixen <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dinesen]</span>,  Karen Christenze</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Isak Dinesen]</span>  (1885&#150;1962), <span class="occ">autobiographer and short-story writer</span>, was born on 17 April 1885 in Rungstedlund, near Copenhagen, Denmark, the second of five children of Wilhelm Adolph Dinesen (1845&#150;1895) and his wife, Ingeborg Westenholz (1856&#150;1940). Thomas, her younger brother, was her great confidant, especially during her later years in Africa. Her father came from a landowning family in Jutland in the north of Denmark and had been a soldier&#151;in both the Danish and French armies&#151;a writer, and a traveller, in Canada, North America, and Europe. Unlike his conservative family he was what the great Danish critic Georg Brandes called &#145;an aristocratic radical&#146;, and his book <span class="italic">Letters from the Hunt</span> has remained a minor Danish classic. Wilhelm later became an independent with liberal sympathies in the Danish parliament. He committed suicide in 1895, having been told that he had an incurable illness. Her mother was from an extremely wealthy family which also had land in Jutland, but they had made their fortunes through trade in corn and other commodities.<br>
<br>Educated initially at home, Karen Dinesen spent nine months at the &Eacute;cole Benet in Lausanne, Switzerland. This was followed by further study at the Hiller&oslash;d folk high school, at a private drawing school, and then at the Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi (Royal Academy of Fine Arts), Copenhagen. Despite opposition from her family, Karen became engaged in December 1912 to her Swedish cousin Baron Bror Blixen-Finecke (1886&#150;1946), &#145;the rough, extroverted nobleman and remorseless prankster&#146;  (Thurman, 105). Bror's uncle Count Morgens Frijs encouraged them to escape from Denmark: &#145;Go to Kenya, you two&#146;  (ibid., 106). Bror Blixen went on ahead to buy land, and they were married in a civil ceremony at Mombasa on 14 January 1914.<br>
<br>The different strands of Karen's Danish background&#151;her hero worship of her adventurous, radical, book-loving, aristocrat father Wilhelm, and her tense relationship with the members of her mother's wealthy bourgeois family, the Westenholzes&#151;in some ways prepared her well for her life in British East Africa, and Kenya as it later became. The early twentieth-century fluidity of the region left her relatively unconstrained by conventional gender, class, and even racial roles. She was both insider and outsider, a European but a Dane, and a woman, and therefore on the edges of the dominant imperial and very masculine nexus of settler, hunter, administrator. Of striking appearance&#151;her huge dark eyes were often remarked on&#151;she was courageous, unorthodox, and (on the strength of her husband's title) an &#145;aristocrat&#146;.<br>
<br>During the eighteen years following her marriage Blixen, or Tanne as she was familiarly known, managed a coffee estate of 6000 acres in the Ngong Hills, close to both Kikuyu and Maasai &#145;reserves&#146; and near the town of Nairobi. It was owned by the Karen Coffee company, set up largely by members of her family who were confident that coffee had a bright future. As it turned out, the land was a fraction too high for coffee and the soil too acidic. Her marriage was short-lived; Bror Blixen was regarded by contemporaries&#151;along with her lover <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39434/', "Denys Finch-Hatton (1887&#150;1931)")</script>&#151;as the model of the African white hunter, and is said to have inspired the figure of Robert Wilson in Ernest Hemingway's <span class="italic">The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber</span>. He was, according to his friends, &#145;one of the most durable, congenial, promiscuous, prodigal creatures who ever lived&#146;  (Thurman, 112). As a husband he was a disaster, and in the first year of marriage passed on syphilis (of the spine, <i>tabes dorsalis</i>) to his young wife. She struggled with its blight all her life, often suffering intensely from its secret and violent assaults on her body, particularly in her last years. Yet the Blixen marriage was finally dissolved only in 1925, and her own response to this was typical of her attitude to fate and misfortune: she loved the dramatic, the mocking gesture in the face of a harsh blow from life, and many of her later stories reflected this austere, gallant, and defiant philosophy. In a letter to her brother Thomas, in September 1926, she wrote: &#145;my illness was not so terribly &#147;repugnant&#148; to me; many shauries [difficulties] that might seem completely intolerable to some people, to me are quite stimulating, such as the difficulties that my &#147;pro-nativeness&#148; land me in with the English&#146;  (Dinesen, <span class="italic">Letters from Africa</span>, 283).<br>
<br>Even before the Blixens parted in 1919 she had met and taken as her lover the Ariel-like hunter&#150;scholar, the Honourable Denys Finch-Hatton, who was to be the great love of her African life. She and Finch-Hatton sometimes hunted together, and to a point he was her adviser and confidant, yet he visited only infrequently between safaris and journeys &#145;home&#146; to England. Finch-Hatton brought Tanne intense happiness, representing a kind of ultimate challenge she had wanted all her life; he introduced her to a range of English and French poets and writers outside her own extensive reading of Spinoza, Voltaire, Nietzsche, John Stuart Mill, and the classic Danish authors such as A. G. Oehlenschlager, S. S. Blicher, and J. L. Heiberg, and also Hans Christian Andersen, all of whom she continued to read avidly while in Kenya. Yet Finch-Hatton refused any real commitment, and their last meeting before his fatal crash in his light aeroplane in May 1931 (a month before she herself left Kenya) may well have been the scene of a bitter quarrel arising from Blixen's jealousy.<br>
<br>In Nairobi Blixen became&#151;in one way&#151;part of the European colonial and settler community based around the young, ramshackle town with its bricolage of buildings ranging from ambitious colonial structures to bungalows, shacks of corrugated iron, and the flimsy structures of the Somali ghetto on its periphery. Among the European community of Nairobi, itself made up of a colourful variety of social types and nationalities, Baroness Blixen must have cut a bold and unconventional figure, walking down Government Street with her finely dressed and dignified Somali servant Faraah Aden a short distance behind her, carrying, usually, her shawl and a rifle. At other times she would be driven by him perhaps to a party at Government House, to the Muthaiga Club&#151;known in the twenties as the Moulin Rouge of Africa and started by her friend Berkely Cole&#151;or she would be seen <i>en route</i> to visit the &#145;flimsy Somali ghetto&#146; on the Limuru Road  (Thurman, 151).<br>
<br>Karen Blixen was a fine shot and an intrepid hunter, earning the name Lioness Blixen from some of the Africans who knew her; she had also, among the Kikuyu &#145;squatters&#146; on her farm, a &#145;reputation as a great if quixotic doctor&#146;  (Thurman, 244). She was an extravagant hostess, who believed in grand menus perfectly executed; her second home, Mbogani House, was a magnet for outcasts and visiting dignitaries alike. These included the prince of Wales, who in 1928&#151;after meeting Karen Blixen at Government House&#151;asked to see an <i>ngoma</i> (a dance) on the farm. It was arranged with difficulty as it was the wrong time of the year for such harvest festivities, but the Kikuyu chiefs agreed, and it was a huge success. In the lesser-known of her two memoirs of Kenya, <span class="italic">Shadows in the Grass</span> (1960), Blixen describes how<blockquote>a stream of supple fiery young people of both sexes [arrived], set on dancing should it cost them their life. The small group of an old Chief and his aged counsellors in rich, heavy monkey skin cloaks, advanced in state, isolated from the common crowd by ten feet of empty space before and after them. (Dinesen, <span class="italic">Shadows</span>, 42)</blockquote>By the time she left Kenya, Baroness Blixen was a celebrity, not only among the circle around Government House, but also one who was known and respected by many Maasai, Kikuyu, and Somalis and by the Indian community. Her knowledge of Swahili, her fierce if hierarchic sense of justice, and her rare attitude of reciprocity towards other cultures, races, and religious beliefs (particularly Islam) marked her out from most other Europeans of the time. Her voluminous letters home (published in English as <span class="italic">Letters from Africa, 1914&#150;1931</span>, in 1981), written largely to her mother, her Aunt Bess Westenholz, and her brother Thomas, show not only her love for Africa as a landscape, but also her clear understanding that both Africans and Indians would play their part in a future Kenyan state. She was, as she herself once put it, &#145;God's chosen snob&#146;  (Thurman, 205), but she wore her &#145;pro-native&#146; label with a defiant pride.<br>
<br>Karen Blixen began drafting in English what later became her first collection of tales (<span class="italic">Seven Gothic Tales</span>, 1934) in the long lonely hours on the farm, and she began writing in earnest in 1926, when the collapse of the estate seemed near. The spare, beautifully written, and highly selective memoir of her life in Kenya <span class="italic">Out of Africa</span> (1937) was written in English and later translated by her into Danish. She had returned to Denmark in June 1931 to live with her mother, Ingeborg, in the old family home at Rungstedlund, next to the sea and looking across &Ouml;re Sund to Sweden. She was forty-six, the coffee estate had been sold, and the company was bankrupt. Blixen had lost her livelihood, her lover, and, perhaps most painful of all, any possibility of staying on in east Africa. For many years she exchanged letters with some of the people on the farm who had been a part of her Kenyan life, but she would never see them again.<br>
<br>The manuscript of her classic, yet unorthodox, account of settler experience in east Africa was written in 1936. By then she had begun to make a name for herself (as Isak Dinesen) through the success in 1934 first in America and then in Britain of <span class="italic">Seven Gothic Tales</span>. Blixen, encouraged by her brother Thomas and struggling to give her past in Africa some meaning in her life, worked partly from notes that she had begun on the Kenyan farm in 1926. She began writing at Rungstedlund and finally, needing solitude, moved to Skagen, on the northernmost tip of Jutland, and finished the manuscript there. As her biographer Judith Thurman states, <span class="italic">Out of Africa</span> is not in any sense documentary writing but rather an overview, &#145;a landscape from the air&#146; with time and action &#145;compressed and telescoped&#146;  (Thurman, 325). In 1985 the book provided the title and narrative structure of a major feature film, starring Meryl Streep as Karen and Robert Redford as Denys Finch-Hatton.<br>
<br>Karen Blixen never returned to east Africa, however much she wished to do so. World events and her uncertain health made it impossible. When Denmark was occupied by the Germans in 1940, she remained at Rungstedlund, writing <span class="italic">Winter's Tales</span> first in English and then in Danish. The English version was sent to Random House, New York, in the Swedish diplomatic pouch, and was published in 1942 under the name Isak Dinesen. A small armed-services edition, able to fit snugly in a soldier's jacket, was also produced, and there is a copy in the British Library. At Rungstedlund Blixen became a magnet for a group of younger Danish writers including Bjorn Parlsen and Thorkild Bjornvig, who later became one of Denmark's leading poets. In the early 1950s she began regular work for radio and spoke on her seventieth birthday speech in 1955 of her pleasure &#145;to be a voice and not a piece of printed matter&#146;  (Thurman, 397). Radio, she felt, confirmed her identity as a storyteller, one of an &#145;ancient, wild and useless tribe&#146;, her roots in the oral tradition, drawing her power from a charged complicity with those who listened  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Karen Blixen died at Rungstedlund on 7 September 1962 at the age of seventy-seven. The last pictures of her were taken by the photographer Cecil Beaton, whom she had met in France on one of her travels as a writer and celebrity  (C. Beaton, <span class="italic">The Restless Years</span>, 1976, 159&#150;61). By the end of her life Karen Blixen had carved a place for herself not only in Danish writing but also in British and postcolonial literature, where she remains a complex and unusual voice speaking from a particular moment in Britain's history of empire.<br>
