<span class="headword">McCrie,  Thomas</span>  (1772&#150;1835), <span class="occ">Original Secession minister and ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born at Duns, Berwickshire, in 1772 and baptized on 22 November, the eldest son of Thomas McCrie, manufacturer and merchant in Duns, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of John Hood, a farmer near Duns. His parents belonged to that branch of the seceders from the Church of Scotland in 1733 known as the Anti-Burghers, who had split from the original seceders by 1747 over the burgess oath, which was held to imply an acknowledgement of the Church of Scotland. Reared in that seceding tradition and encouraged by his maternal grandfather, Thomas received a classical education at Duns parish school, and before he had reached the age of fifteen served as an elementary teacher in two country schools near by. In 1788 he became an usher or assistant teacher first at the parish school at Kelso, Roxburghshire, and then in East Linton, Haddingtonshire, before entering Edinburgh University in December of that year. His arts course included classes in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, mathematics, logic, and moral philosophy, to whose professor, Dugald Stewart, among all his college teachers, he was most indebted. As was not unusual, he did not graduate; and in May 1791 he was appointed teacher at a private Anti-Burgher school in Brechin, Forfarshire. During the harvest months from September 1791 he attended the Divinity Hall at Whitburn, Linlithgowshire, where he studied for the ministry of his denomination under the Revd Archibald Bruce, professor of theology in the Anti-Burghers' General Associate Synod&#151;an office to which McCrie succeeded in 1816. In May 1794 he left his teaching post at Brechin and spent the summer at the home of his maternal uncle near Dunbar, Haddingtonshire, before returning to Edinburgh University in the winter to complete his arts course by attending the natural philosophy class. Licensed on 9 September 1795 by the associate presbytery of Kelso, he declined to express a view on the magistrate's power in religious matters, for the subject was then pending before the General Associate Synod, and was admitted minister of the second associate congregation in Potterrow, Edinburgh, on 26 May 1796. On 24 December that year he married Janet (<span class="italic">IGI</span> gives Jessie) Dickson (<i>d</i>. 1821), daughter of William Dickson, a farmer in Swinton parish, Berwickshire. They had four sons and one daughter: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17407/', "Thomas McCrie (1797&#150;1875)")</script>, professor of church history and systematic theology in the English Presbyterian College, London; William, a merchant in Edinburgh; Jessie, who married Archibald Meikle of Flemington; John, who died aged twenty-eight on 4 October 1837; and George, minister of Clova, Aberdeenshire.<br>
<br>From 1793 the Anti-Burghers, to McCrie's dismay, developed scruples on the civil magistrate's role within the church, which led them to revise their adherence to the teaching of the Westminster confession of faith on the magistrate's duty to promote true religion. Their &#145;new testimony&#146;, adopted by the General Associate Synod in May 1804, led McCrie with five other ministers, including his mentor Archibald Bruce, vigorously to protest at the synod's action. McCrie remained attached to the standards and constitution of the Church of Scotland &#145;as settled in her reforming periods&#146;, upheld the principle of an established church, and condemned the complete separation of church and state. On 28 August 1806 he and three other &#145;Old Light&#146; ministers formed themselves into the Constitutional Associate Presbytery. Deposed from his ministry by the synod on 2 September 1806 and ejected from his Potterrow meeting-house after a lawsuit in March 1809, McCrie assembled his people for worship in a chapel at the foot of Carrubber's Close, Edinburgh, until in 1813 a new church was built in West Richmond Street, where he preached for the rest of his life. By 1827 the &#145;constitutionalists&#146; were joined by former brethren who, dissatisfied with the union of the Burgher and Anti-Burgher synods in 1820, had split to form the Associate Synod of Protesters, and who merged with McCrie's Constitutional Presbytery on 18 May as the Associate Synod of Original Seceders, a designation intended to denote that they stood precisely on the same ground as that occupied by the original seceders; later they adopted the name Original Secession church.<br>
<br>In these disputes McCrie's stand was reinforced by his study of Scottish church history since the Reformation, and he proved a formidable scholar in defending Presbyterian traditions. His earlier writings on church history included a study of the Hussites and essays on the covenanting minister Alexander Henderson; Patrick Hamilton, first Scottish martyr in the Reformation; Francis Lambert of Avignon, the French reformer of Hesse; Andr&eacute; Rivet, French protestant and professor at Leiden; and John Murray, a Scottish Presbyterian opponent of James VI. His first major work, a scholarly and sympathetic biography of John Knox, published in 1811, sought to counter the prevailing &#145;enlightened&#146; view of Knox in the histories of David Hume and William Robertson as a fierce and gloomy bigot, the foe to polite learning and innocent enjoyment, who stirred up vulgar enthusiasm to effect a revolution against Rome and France in defiance of the crown. The evangelical revival helps account for the widespread popularity of McCrie's <span class="italic">Knox</span> and for a renewed interest in the principles of the Scottish Reformation. On 3 February 1813 Edinburgh University conferred on him the degree of doctor of divinity. His next study, appropriately, was a biography of Andrew Melville (1545&#150;1622), the champion of presbytery and adversary of James VI's bishops, in which McCrie made extensive use of manuscript material to elucidate the principles of early presbyterianism. That work, first published in 1819, did not gain the popularity of his study of Knox, though it involved &#145;a hundred times more labour&#146;, yet its scholarship remains unsurpassed nearly two centuries later. On the &#145;second reformation&#146; of the covenanting period, McCrie took to task Sir Walter Scott's view in <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span> that the covenanters, far from defending political freedoms, were no more than religious enthusiasts determined to impose an ecclesiastical tyranny. For McCrie, the Reformation principles of Scotland combined political and religious liberty, and the covenanters had played a crucial role in the struggle for national and individual rights. His literary output extended to histories of the Reformation in Italy (1827), translated into French, German, and Dutch (and placed on the papal <span class="italic">Index expurgatorius</span>) and in Spain (1829), and, at the end of his life, an uncompleted study of Calvin.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife on 1 June 1821, McCrie sailed for the Netherlands in May 1822, visiting The Hague, Leiden, Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Utrecht, and preached at the Scots Kirk in Rotterdam. At home he served as a founding member of the Gaelic School Society, opposed whig plans for Irish education in 1832, petitioned the House of Commons against Roman Catholic emancipation in 1829, and gave evidence in 1834 to a House of Commons committee on church patronage, which he considered to be at variance with Presbyterian principles. On 4 October 1827 he married Mary Chalmers, the fourth daughter of Robert Chalmers, minister of Haddington. McCrie died in Edinburgh on 3 August 1835 and was buried on 12 August in Greyfriars churchyard; a deputation from the general assembly of the Church of Scotland attended his funeral.<br>
