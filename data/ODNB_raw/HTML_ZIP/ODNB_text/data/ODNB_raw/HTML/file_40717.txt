<span class="headword">Innes,  James Dickson</span>  (1887&#150;1914), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 27 February 1887 at Greenfield Villas, Murray Street, Llanelli, one of the three sons of John Innes and his wife, Alice Ann Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rees. Although, as Augustus John put it, he felt bound to Wales &#145;by every tie of sentiment and predilection&#146;  (Holroyd, 352), his father, an engineer (or possibly, as recorded on Innes's birth certificate, an accountant) at a local tin-plate works, was in fact Scottish, and his mother was of French extraction. Innes was educated at the local higher grade school before being sent to Christ College, Brecon (1894&#150;1904). He then studied art at Carmarthen Art School (1904&#150;5) and from there won a scholarship to the Slade School of Fine Art (1906&#150;8), where he fell particularly under the influence of Philip Wilson Steer. His other formative influences were the works of John Cotman and Turner (he always carried with him a copy of Turner's <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span>). While still a student he began to exhibit at the New English Art Club. He had rooms in Fitzroy Street, London, and briefly experimented with the subject matter and techniques then being espoused by his neighbours Walter Sickert and Frederick Spencer Gore.<br>
<br>In 1908 Innes travelled to France with John Fothergill. They visited Caudebec, Bozouls, and then&#151;&#145;because it looked so good on the map&#146;  (Holroyd, 352)&#151;the little town of Collioure on the Mediterranean coast near the Spanish border. The revelation of southern light and colour had a lasting effect on Innes and his art. The trip had to be curtailed, however, when Innes fell ill. He returned to England and was diagnosed as consumptive. His mother took him to St Ives to rest and recuperate. During his convalescence he painted a series of idealized landscapes. When he was well enough Innes returned to France, where he took a studio in Paris. Outside a Parisian caf&eacute; he met and fell in love with Euphemia Lamb, the wife of the artist Henry Lamb. With her he travelled south again to Collioure. A one-man exhibition of his watercolours&#151;many of which were done on this trip&#151;was mounted at the Chenil Gallery, London, in January 1911. The work showed increasing stylization of forms and flatter bolder colours derived, perhaps, from his study of Japanese prints.<br>
<br>Innes returned to London in the autumn of 1910 and began to see much of Augustus John (whom he had first met while at the Slade). Together the two painters began to explore and paint in north Wales. In the spring of 1911 Innes &#145;discovered&#146; the mountain of Arenig, which was to become one of his sacred sites; under a cairn on the summit he buried a casket of Euphemia Lamb's letters. John and he rented a cottage nearby, at Nant-ddu. Following John's example, Innes began to make quick oil sketches, rather than watercolours. These small landscapes&#151;done at great speed&#151;he charged with the colour and intensity that he had first discovered in the south of France.<br>
<br>At the end of 1911, after a third excursion to Collioure, Innes returned to London and contributed to the second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64739/', "Camden Town Group")</script> show. His bohemian existence, and his refusal to compromise in the face of his illness, were, however, taking a heavy toll on his health. He travelled to Spain with Lord Howard de Walden (a new patron) and to Ireland (at the invitation of Lady Gregory), but suffered a collapse at Galway races and had to be taken back to England by John. In search of health, he made another visit to the south of France, accompanied by the young Australian painter Derwent Lees. Although frequently depressed, he produced some his best work, transforming the landscape through his heightened sense of colour and form. It was a style that, although essentially post-impressionist, also owed something to the symbolist tradition in its emotional intensity.<br>
<br>On his return to London in the spring of 1913 Innes enjoyed a successful one-man exhibition at the Chenil Gallery. It was his swan song. The money he earned was spent on a series of medical retreats, in England and then abroad&#151;in Morocco and on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He did no more work but his health continued to decline. Brought back to England by his brother Jack, Innes was nursed by his mother at Brighton, and then moved to a nursing home at Swanley, Kent, where he died on 22 August 1914.<br>
<br>Innes was an arresting and &#145;artistic&#146; figure, with his broad-brimmed Quaker hat, coloured silk scarf, long overcoat, and gold-topped ebony cane. John described him as having:<blockquote>features of a slightly cadaverous cast, with glittering black eyes, a wide sardonic mouth, a prominent nose and a large bony forehead, invaded by streaks of thin black hair &hellip; [He] spoke with a heavy English accent, which had been imposed on an agreeable Welsh substratum. (John, &#145;Fragment of an autobiography&#146;, 255)</blockquote>Yet besides this pose, and a certain appetite for dissipation, his most telling characteristic was a rare and unselfconscious, almost visionary, directness.<br>
