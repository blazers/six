<span class="headword">Kentish,  John</span>  (1768&#150;1853), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born at St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 26 June 1768, the only child (after the death in infancy of a daughter born in 1773) of John Kentish (<i>d</i>. 1814) and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1793), daughter and heir of Keaser Vanderplank. The Kentishes were a family of landowners and brewers whose importance in St Albans runs back at least to the fifteenth century. The elder John Kentish, at one time a draper, was the youngest son and ultimately the heir of Thomas Kentish, who in 1723 was high sheriff of Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Kentish was educated at the school of John Worsley (<i>d</i>. 1807) at Hertford and in 1784 entered Daventry Academy as a divinity student. At Daventry he was a &#145;parlour boarder&#146;, with better accommodation than students on the foundation and with easier access to the chief tutor, Thomas Belsham. In September 1788 with two fellow students, John Corrie (1769&#150;1839) and William Shepherd (1768&#150;1847), he left Daventry for the new college at Hackney, following the prohibition by the Coward trustees, who controlled Daventry, against any use of written prayers; the next year Belsham, having turned Unitarian, also moved to Hackney.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1790 Kentish left Hackney to become the first minister of a newly formed Unitarian congregation at Plymouth Dock. A chapel in George Street was opened on 27 April 1791 by Theophilus Lindsey, using a prayer book drawn up by Kentish and Thomas Porter, minister of the Treville Street congregation, Plymouth. In 1794 Kentish succeeded Porter, who, like many Unitarians in that repressive period, emigrated to the United States. In 1795 he moved to London as afternoon preacher at the Gravel Pit, Hackney, where Belsham had become the morning preacher in succession to Joseph Priestley in 1794, adding to this office appointment as morning preacher at Newington Green from 1799 to 1802 and at St Thomas's Street, Southwark in 1802&#150;3. On 23 January 1803 he became minister of the New Meeting in Birmingham. On 28 October 1805 he married Mary (1775&#150;1864), daughter of John Kettle of Birmingham (<i>d</i>. 1808); there were no children.<br>
<br>A full-length silhouette, executed in 1851, exhibits Kentish's short stature, portly figure, and old-fashioned costume with knee-breeches. He was a man of great personal dignity, and his weight of character, extensive learning, and ample fortune generously administered, secured him a wide respect rarely accorded a nonconformist minister. He was a sound scholar, versed in oriental languages and familiar with the works of German biblical critics. Relying heavily on biblical exegesis, he was a Unitarian of the most conservative type, holding closely to the miraculous foundation of revelation. His sermons, rigorously non-doctrinal and practical, were remarkable for beauty of style. In politics he was an old whig, as disapproving of radicals in the 1830s as he had been of his more extreme fellow students at Hackney. Until the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832 deprived him of his vote as a burgess of St Albans, he regularly supported the Spencer family, patrons of the borough, but looked dubiously on the narrow self-interest of other electors.<br>
<br>Kentish published a number of separately printed sermons and a collection in 1848, the second edition of which (1854) carries an admirable memoir by John Kenrick (1788&#150;1877). His most important and characteristic theological work is <span class="italic">Notes and Comments on Passages of Scripture</span> (1844; 3rd edn, 1848). His memoir of the Revd Timothy Kenrick (1759&#150;1804) is prefixed to Kenrick's <span class="italic">Exposition</span> (1807). He was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> and the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, usually with the signature N. In 1832 Kentish declined his stipend but remained a minister, continuing to preach frequently until 1844. He retained his faculties to a great age, but an attack of paralysis in 1850 began a slow decline. He died of pneumonia on Sunday 6 March 1853 at his residence, Park Vale, Edgbaston. On 15 March he was buried in the public general cemetery at Kaye Hill, Hookley, near Birmingham.<br>
