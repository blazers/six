<span class="headword">Bevan,  Francis Augustus</span>  (1840&#150;1919), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 17 January 1840 at 42 Upper Harley Street, London, the second son among the fourteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47420/', "Robert Cooper Lee Bevan (1809&#150;1890)")</script>, banker; his mother, Robert Bevan's first wife, was Lady Agneta Elisabeth Yorke, who died in 1851 when Francis was aged ten. His widower father did not immediately remarry and was assisted in bringing up the children by his deceased wife's maid, Lydia Marsh, and a private tutor, the Revd R. S. Tabor. Francis was then educated at Harrow School, before undertaking two years of foreign travel for which his taste persisted, with regular visits to the continent, and trips further afield to America, the Middle East, and India.<br>
<br>Bevan was married three times. In 1862 he married Elizabeth Marianne (1840&#150;1863), daughter of Lord Charles James Fox Russell. They had one son. Bevan's second wife, whom he married on 19 April 1866, was Constance (1841&#150;1872), youngest daughter of Sir James Weir Hogg, baronet. They had five sons. In 1875 he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1903), second daughter of John Trotter of Dyrham Park, Barnet.<br>
<br>Bevan became a partner in the leading Lombard Street bank of Barclay, Bevan &amp; Co. in 1859, succeeding as senior partner on his father's death in 1890. He was less decisive and rigid than his father and did not show his father's determination to maintain the bank's profitable independent existence at the heart of a national network of private banks. In 1896 he became the first chairman of a new corporate entity, Barclay &amp; Co., which merged his Lombard Street partnership with the dominant East Anglian bank of Gurney &amp; Co. (then controlled by the Barclay family and others), the north-eastern Backhouse Bank, and several smaller private banks. The new corporate bank grew rapidly, both by building new branches and by acquiring many small private banks whose owners warmed to Bevan's relaxed acceptance of their continuing local independence. However, the corporate bank was not as profitable as the old partnership, and from 1902 (when its shares were first quoted) the founding families' ownership interest was gradually diluted, becoming a minority one by the time Francis Bevan retired.<br>
<br>An Anglican, Bevan gave generously to a large number of Christian charities and missions; at a personal level, too, he was often uncritically open-handed. This generosity, together with his somewhat lax business instincts, appears to have led to a decline in the Bevan family fortune in real terms: his wealth at death was substantially below his father's, even in money terms. This was unlikely to have been due only to tax avoidance strategies, though certainly such strategies were more critical in 1919 than in 1890. The family estate at Trent Park, New Barnet, Hertfordshire, was sold in 1909 to Sir Edward Sassoon and Bevan settled at an old Mayfair house, at 1 Tilney Street, Park Lane. Although his son Cosmo (1863&#150;1935) was a local director in Lombard Street from 1896 to 1933 and a main board director from 1905 to 1933, he was overshadowed in the bank's senior management by the professional manager Frederick Goodenough from 1917: Bevan's descendants in the bank, including another son, Bertrand Yorke (1867&#150;1948) who also became director, did not produce another chairman until 1981.<br>
<br>Bevan enjoyed travel abroad, cricket, classical concerts, and motoring, but his latter years were marred by intermittent illness, and he retired from the chairmanship at the beginning of 1917. He continued to attend the board and committee meetings until his death from heart disease on 31 August 1919, at Monk Sherbourne, Granville Road, Eastbourne, aged seventy-nine. He was buried in the family vault at Trent Park churchyard.<br>
