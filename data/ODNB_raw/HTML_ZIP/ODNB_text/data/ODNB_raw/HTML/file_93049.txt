<span class="headword">Gaevernitz,  Gerhart  von Schulze-</span>  (1864&#150;1943), <span class="occ">political economist and commentator on Britain</span>, was born in Breslau on 25 July 1864, the only son of Hermann von Schulze-Gaevernitz (1824&#150;1888), constitutional lawyer and academic, who in 1853 had published a book on the English economy, and his wife, Luise, the daughter of the industrialist and liberal politician Karl August Milde (1805&#150;1861). Schulze-Gaevernitz's maternal grandfather, who was president of the Prussian national assembly in 1848, owned a cotton and calico-printing business, and had served an apprenticeship in Manchester, where he came under the influence of Richard Cobden.<br>
<br>Schulze-Gaevernitz was brought up until the age of fourteen on his maternal grandparents' estate in an intellectual and liberal Catholic milieu. In 1878 the family moved to Heidelberg, where Schulze-Gaevernitz attended the local Gymnasium. He studied jurisprudence in Heidelberg, Berlin, Leipzig, and G&ouml;ttingen. In 1886 he passed the exam for the higher civil service, before obtaining his doctorate from G&ouml;ttingen. Over the next five years he travelled widely, visiting England, Belgium, France, and Italy. He visited Lancashire, and lived in the East End of London, witnessing the London dockers' strike during the summer of 1889.<br>
<br>Schulze-Gaevernitz resumed his civil service career in Strasbourg, where he attended the lectures of the left-liberal economist Lujo Brentano, whose influence was apparent in Schulze-Gaevernitz's first book, <span class="italic">Zum socialen Frieden</span>, published in 1890. His progressive views and liberal background were ill suited to a career in the Prussian civil service and in 1890 he left to focus on academia, completing his <span class="italic">Habilitation</span> on Thomas Carlyle in 1891. After travelling and studying in Russia he taught economics at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, where in 1896 he was appointed to a full professorship. Soon after, he married Johanna Hirsch, the cultivated daughter of a well-known merchant, Emil Hirsch, and his social activist wife, Berta, from Mannheim. The marriage produced two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>In 1912 Schulze-Gaevernitz was elected to the Reichstag to represent Freiburg-Breisgau for the Progressive People's Party. After 1918 he represented the same part of Baden in the national assembly of the Weimar republic as a member of the German Democratic Party. As a serving officer during the First World War he opposed unrestricted aerial bombardment and U-boat warfare, publicizing his views in the American press, for which he was much criticized in Germany. In mid-life he became a Quaker. After the war he was a visiting professor in England and the United States, lecturing at Cornell, Columbia, and the University of Wisconsin in Madison. In 1925 he was appointed head of the department for bibliography and scientific relations at the League of Nations International Institute of Intellectual Co-operation in Paris. His last years, spent in retirement in Silesia, were devoted primarily to religious concerns. He died at Crainsdorf, near Neurode in Silesia, on 10 July 1943.<br>
<br>Schulze-Gaevernitz was a frequent visitor to and commentator on Britain: like other German writers, he viewed British industry as inaugurating a new economic era, destined to be followed throughout the capitalist world. It was therefore an important laboratory for the social investigator. In his early research into Lancashire he was aided by his acquaintance with the employers' secretaries, Samuel Andrew and Joshua Rawlinson. His contacts in Britain included Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas, Gilbert Murray, and the Liberal politician and journalist G. P. Gooch. His first book, <span class="italic">Social Peace</span>, was translated into English by C. M. Wicksteed, with an introduction by Wallas, in 1893. The German original was a sizeable intellectual and institutional study of the British labour movement, which was truncated in a translation that omitted the extensive consideration of Carlyle and Christian socialism.<br>
<br>Schulze-Gaevernitz stressed the value of a moralized conception of society, which he contrasted with atomistic individualism and sectional conflict. His left-liberal politics owed much to his Kantianism, apparent in his sympathetic examination of idealist aspects of British political thought in the nineteenth century. His work was principally addressed to contemporary German concerns, and sought to reveal and recommend to a German audience the British route to social peace through the development of the factory system, trade unions, and a high-wage economy. Britain, it appeared, had achieved lasting social stability at the same time as developing a highly productive economy. He elaborated his defence of the link between enhanced wages and rising productivity in an analysis of the cotton industry in Britain, translated into English in 1895. Reviewed in both economic and more general periodicals, his writings on British industry contributed to the debate about the impact of trade unions upon the economy. His account of the Lancashire cotton industry became a respected source, footnoted by Alfred Marshall and the Webbs, and translated into several languages.<br>
<br>During the 1900s Schulze-Gaevernitz's understanding of the lessons of British history for Germany changed, as his views became more nationalist. In 1906 he published a study of British imperialism in the nineteenth century, which explained British expansionism in ethical and religious terms and argued that protectionism would supplant free trade as its economic creed. His work in the 1900s had affinities with that of Weber, with whom he taught at Freiburg, and his advocacy of social reform and a reduction in junker power in Germany also paralleled Weber's political prescriptions. This work, however, received less notice in Britain, and was not translated into English. His most significant post-war work was perhaps his study of the role of banking in German economic development. His last book, based on his Swarthmore lectures delivered in London in 1929, returned to the history of Britain, and assessed the relationship between Quakerism and democracy. It was, however, his early work on the labour question that inspired most interest in Britain, and to which historians of Britain have paid greatest attention.<br>
