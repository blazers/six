<span class="headword">Gravelet,  Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois &Eacute;mile</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing names </em>Blondin, Charles Blondin]</span>  (1824&#150;1897), <span class="occ">tightrope walker</span>, was born on 28 February 1824 at Hesdin, near St Omer in France, the son of Andr&eacute; Gravelet (<i>c</i>.1789&#150;1832/3), himself a tightrope walker and a soldier in Napoleon's grande arm&eacute;e, the holder of the cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. His mother was Eulalie Merlet (<i>c</i>.1794&#150;1833/4). In 1829 a troupe of travelling entertainers came to the neighbourhood and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois was fascinated by them. He tried out tightrope walking between two chairs with disastrous but salutary results. He was then and there convinced of the necessity of being almost obsessively well prepared for any dangerous acts he proposed to carry out. A local former sailor skilled in climbing rigging took an interest in the boy's ambitions and helped him to practise in a wood nearby. When the parents were convinced of their son's prowess and single-mindedness they enrolled him at the age of five as a residential pupil in the famous &Eacute;cole de Gymnase in Lyon, the foremost training ground for acrobats of all kinds. He appeared professionally as the Little Wonder some six months later, and within two years was in Turin at the royal command of the king of Sardinia.<br>
<br>After leaving the school Gravelet, who was orphaned by the age of ten, joined circus troupes and appeared all over the continent for about eighteen years. In 1851 he became a member of the famous Ravel Family of French acrobats, which included one with the name Blondin, from whom some authorities say the pseudonym may have derived; others assert that he adopted a nickname first applied to his father. With the troupe he went to America under a contract from Phineas T. Barnum. In the course of the journey across the Atlantic, Blondin rescued a young nobleman who was swept overboard in a storm, and who was later to show his gratitude in a material way. With the Ravels he appeared at Niblo's Gardens in New York, and in Boston and Philadelphia. In the spring of 1858 Blondin visited Niagara Falls and conceived his plan of making a crossing on a rope. With his usual attention to detail, it took him nearly a year to work out a possible line of approach. About 1858 he married Charlotte Sophia Lawrence (1838&#150;1888), who was said in the dedication of a pamphlet by G. L. Banks in 1862 to be &#145;the high-minded and exemplary wife of a brave and devoted husband&#146;. They had three daughters and two sons. Blondin was described at this time as of medium height (5 feet 5 inches), stocky, weighing 10 stone, with a broad chest and muscular arms, light grey close-set eyes, fair (though not blond) hair to his shoulders, and a small imperial beard. He was a teetotaller.<br>
<br>Blondin had no capital to fund his venture and approached the editors of the <span class="italic">Niagara Falls Daily Gazette</span>, obtaining their support when he convinced them that he was in earnest. His agent, Harry Colcord, also took some persuading that the apparently mad plan was feasible. All sorts of problems were presented: General Porter, the owner of Goat Island, near the falls, where Blondin had calculated he should make the crossing, would not give permission and he had to go further downstream; the 3-inch-wide rope would cost $1300; and while the owners of local hotels and tourist venues were not slow to see the attraction of the &#145;show&#146;, they would not provide much finance. But Blondin doggedly went ahead, and crowds variously estimated at between 10,000 and 25,000 were brought in by extra trains and steamers.<br>
<br>Blondin stepped out onto the wide rope (by his standards) at five o'clock on a sunny day, 30 June 1859, with his 30 foot balancing-pole weighing 40 lb. He completed the crossing from the American to the Canadian side in seventeen and a half minutes, having stopped on the way to lie down to rest and to pull up a bottle of refreshing drink from the deck of the steamer <i>Maid of the mist</i>, moored in midstream. Bands played on both sides and were packing up when Blondin announced that he would make the return journey, and did so in seven minutes. Accounts of the feats he performed differ fairly widely, but it is certain that various other &#145;stunt&#146; crossings were organized in the next few weeks. On 14 September 1860 the prince of Wales, then on a tour of Canada and America, witnessed a performance. Blondin offered to take the prince across on his back but this was vetoed by the duke of Newcastle, who was in charge of the party. The prince none the less much enjoyed the spectacle, which included a crossing on stilts, and sent a cheque in appreciation. This must have been welcome, as no great financial success attended the venture. Jones' Wood in New York was his next venue, and there he met again the young nobleman, &#145;Comte A&#146;, whom he had rescued at sea; he urged Blondin to give up his dangerous profession and, when unsuccessful in his plea, presented him with a diamond ring.<br>
<br>Henry Coleman, Blondin's new manager, sailed for England and arranged an appearance at the Crystal Palace in London in June 1861, which was accompanied by the band of the Coldstream Guards. The crowds applauded, but Dickens and <span class="italic">Punch</span> were scathing, the latter publishing a skit interview between Boswell and Johnson on Blondin. The Crystal Palace Company made &pound;10,000 profit from seats at half a crown and 5<i>s</i>. (pre-booked), from which Blondin received only &pound;1200, out of which he had to pay all his expenses. A provincial tour followed, during which a lion was pushed across the rope strapped into a wheelbarrow. Further years at the Crystal Palace earned more money, and Blondin bought a house in London's Finchley Road, which he named Niagara Villa, with a carriage and pair and servants to ease Madame Blondin's domestic life. After a farewell performance in February 1863, the Blondin family set off on a tour of France, Spain, Russia, Portugal, and Italy, and in 1864 he went to South America for two years. India, Australia, and New Zealand followed, with another tour of South America. He became a naturalized British subject on 4 June 1868. In 1879 some unrecorded financial disaster struck, the house and trappings were sold, and another, more modest one, in Ealing, was purchased. So the performances had to continue: Europe and even Ceylon, then London again, and off to New York. Madame Blondin died on 19 December 1888. Another residence, Niagara House, was built in Northfield Lane, Ealing, where Blondin, though never fully retired, kept domestic animals and made small handicraft objects. Blondin's residence was demolished in the 1930s but a mansion block&#151;close to Niagara and Blondin avenues&#151;retains the name.<br>
<br>At the age of seventy Blondin again performed at the Crystal Palace, refusing a net, and in 1895 at Blackpool he injured his back. He married the nurse who looked after him, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James (1864/5&#150;1901), at Brentford register office on 29 November 1895, and lived another two years with her. His final performance was at Belfast in 1896. He died at Niagara House of diabetes on 22 February 1897 and was buried beside his first wife in Kensal Green cemetery. Phrenological examination, which was popular at the time, showed him to be careful, prudent, jealous of his own self-respect, and conscious of his obligations to his family and society.<br>
