<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martin,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1705, <em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">lecturer on science and maker of scientific instruments</span>, was baptized at Worplesdon, Surrey, on 1 March 1705, the third son of John Martin (<i>d</i>. 1731) of Broadstreet, who farmed near Worplesdon, and his wife, Jane. Nothing is known about his childhood; it is presumed that he spent his youth working on the land, during which period he acquired (apparently through extensive reading) knowledge of a wide range of subjects. In his late twenties he established a school at Chichester, Sussex, where (according to his advertisements) he taught almost everything from writing to astronomy. In this venture he was assisted by his marriage in 1729 to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1781), daughter of Joshua Lover, a recently deceased Chichester maltster. It was during Martin's residence at Chichester that he began to write, with the avowed intention of bringing down the price of books, especially for the benefit of those who were trying to educate themselves as he had done.<br>
<br>Martin's first publication <span class="italic">The Philosophical Grammar</span> (1735), consisted of an epitome of current knowledge in the various branches of natural philosophy presented in a single inexpensive volume. An enlarged second edition (1738) was reprinted six times up to 1778, and was translated into Dutch, French, and Italian. In 1737 he produced a complementary work on non-mathematical subjects, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca technologica</span>, which considered the literary arts and sciences under twenty-five headings, ranging from theology to heraldry; it was later translated into French and Italian. The <span class="italic">Bibliotheca</span> was published by subscription, and the 564 names listed show that Martin by this time was becoming well known. Other volumes written at Chichester include <span class="italic">Arithmetic</span> (1735), <span class="italic">Trigonometry</span> (1736), <span class="italic">Geometry</span> (1739), <span class="italic">Logarithms</span> (1739), and <span class="italic">Optics</span> (1740). Astronomy was presented in a large copperplate print, <span class="italic">Synopsis scientiae Caelestis</span> (1739).<br>
<br>Optics became a major field of interest and expertise for Martin. In 1738&#150;9 he devised a portable compound microscope with a micrometer. Later known as drum microscopes, instruments of this pattern were produced commercially into Victorian times. Martin's own Chichester microscopes, however, made mainly of wood and cardboard, were hardly comparable with the products of professional instrument makers in London. In 1742 Martin moved to Reading, Berkshire, where he produced two quarto volumes, <span class="italic">Micrographia nova</span> (1742) and <span class="italic">A Course of Lectures in Natural and Experimental Philosophy</span> (1743). By then he was trying to earn a living by giving lectures and demonstrations on Newtonian experimental philosophy similar to those given in London for many years by J. T. Desaguliers FRS.<br>
<br>Hoping to gain support for election to fellowship of the Royal Society, he wrote to Sir Hans Sloane and other members. This distinction, he told them, would be a great help in obtaining audiences for his lectures. His manner of approach was, however, somewhat inept, and he never acquired the coveted FRS after his name.<br>
<br>In August 1743 Martin was lecturing in Bristol, and in 1744 he gave several courses in Bath. Early in 1745 he attempted to find audiences in London: this initial sortie into the metropolis was probably not very successful, and by September he was again lecturing in Bath, which remained his base for the next few years. In 1746 his <span class="italic">Essay on Electricity</span>, describing experiments &#145;as I daily shew in my Course of Philosophy&#146;, was published there. A little earlier a work on electricity by John Freke FRS had been published in London, which caused Martin some concern. However, having obtained a copy and found that (in his opinion) it was nonsense, Martin said so in the preface to his <span class="italic">Essay</span>. This naturally upset Freke, who quickly produced a second edition in which he called Martin &#145;an unmannerly country show-man&#146; and deplored the practice of giving lectures for money. Martin responded at once with a supplement containing a witty and devastating attack on Freke and his theories.<br>
<br>In 1747 Martin produced <span class="italic">Philosophia Britannica</span> (2 vols.), a greatly expanded version of his <span class="italic">Lectures</span> (1743). An augmented three-volume edition appeared in 1759 (reprinted twice), and it was translated into German in 1772. A shorter <span class="italic">Plain and Familiar Introduction to the Newtonian Philosophy</span>, written primarily for people attending his lectures, was published in 1751 by William Owen in London; it reached a fifth edition in 1765.<br>
<br>After 1746 Martin spent about ten years travelling in southern England and the midlands. Although his principal occupation was lecturing on experimental philosophy, he also found time to write <span class="italic">Institutions of Language</span> (1748) and <span class="italic">Lingua Britannica reformata, or, A New English Dictionary</span> (1749). The second edition of the latter (1754) incorporated numerous topographical entries&#151;Martin later claimed to have visited most of the principal towns of England.<br>
<br>Martin's most ambitious literary project was <span class="italic">The general magazine of arts and sciences, philosophical, philological, mathematical, and mechanical</span>. Designed to be published in about 120 sixpenny monthly numbers, beginning in January 1755, it was extensively advertised in London and provincial newspapers. A combination of a part-work encyclopaedia and a topical periodical, each number consisted of a few pages of five separate main works, with associated copperplates, plus a few pages of topical material, such as births and deaths, and prices of stocks. On completion of the project in 1764 the text and plates were bound into thirteen octavo volumes entitled: <span class="italic">The Young Gentleman and Lady's Philosophy</span>, <span class="italic">The Natural History of England</span>, <span class="italic">A Comprehensive System of Philology</span>, <span class="italic">Mathematical Institutions</span> (all 2 vols.), <span class="italic">Biographia philosophica</span> (1 vol.), and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Correspondence</span> (4 vols.). Only the last had any resemblance to a periodical: the others were complete works in themselves.<br>
<br>In 1756 Martin abandoned travelling and settled in Fleet Street, London, near Crane Court, where the Royal Society then had its premises. Having obtained the freedom of the Goldsmiths' Company, he began to trade as an optician and instrument maker. He was now aged fifty and needed spectacles for reading. Initially for his own use, and then for general sale, he devised &#145;Visual Glasses&#146;, and used them for his shop sign. Unlike conventional spectacles, they had apertures partially blanked off by an annulus of horn, lenses tilted inwards, and glass tinted violet or green. Derided by established opticians, they nevertheless proved popular and were eventually copied by other traders. Martin explained their advantages in <span class="italic">An Essay on Visual Glasses</span> (1756), the first of at least thirty tracts to be published from his Fleet Street address.<br>
<br>Martin was assisted in his shop at first by both his wife, Mary, and daughter, Maria; the latter, who was born about 1738, became the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37589/', "Humphrey Jackson FRS")</script>, chemist, in 1763. In 1757 Martin acquired the globe plates and tools of the late John Senex FRS (<i>d</i>. 1740). Globe manufacture and sale became an important part of his activities, but he also dealt in all types of scientific instruments, primarily as a retailer and wholesaler. To promote his business he issued priced catalogues of standard products, advertised frequently in the newspapers, and published descriptive tracts on individual instruments. These were novel activities at the time and were viewed with suspicion by established traders, but eventually they became the norm. In the mid-1760s, probably as a result of this aggressive marketing, he obtained substantial orders from Harvard College, Massachusetts, to replace the scientific instruments lost in a fire in 1764.<br>
<br>It was characteristic of Martin that he felt he could improve whatever came under his scrutiny. In 1758 he produced <span class="italic">New Principles of Geography and Navigation</span>, which contained charts based on the true spheroidal shape of the earth. In 1766 he obtained his only patent, for a new form of bilge-pump; he hoped it would be adopted by the navy, but to his disgust the Admiralty rejected it. In the same year he published <span class="italic">The New Art of Surveying by the Goniometer</span>, and in 1770 reported a new form of pendulum and escapement in <span class="italic">The Description and Use of a Table Clock</span>.<br>
<br>During the winters from 1756 Martin gave continuous evening lecture courses in London on experimental philosophy. He was especially active as a lecturer around the time of the expected return of Halley's comet (1758 to 1759) and the transits of Venus (1761 and 1769). However, advancing age began to curtail his lecturing&#151;but not his writing&#151;activities, and from about 1778 he traded as &#145;Benjamin Martin &amp; Son&#146;. The latter, Joshua Lover Martin, had been formally apprenticed to him in 1758, but apparently lacked his father's business acumen.<br>
<br>In January 1782 Benjamin Martin was declared bankrupt, and on 9 February he died at his home in Fleet Street, possibly as a delayed result of a suicide attempt. He was buried in St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 14 February. His son made no attempt to continue the business, and is thought to have left England. Martin was one of the best known of the many popularizers of science of his day, remarkable for his successful versatility. As he died a bankrupt, all his effects were sold by auction: the sale catalogue reveals that, as one of the first true retailers in the scientific instruments trade, he held an astonishingly large and varied stock, which raised about &pound;1000.<br>
