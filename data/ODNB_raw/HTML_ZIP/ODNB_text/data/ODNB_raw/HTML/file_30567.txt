<span class="headword">Ballance, Sir  Charles Alfred</span>  (1856&#150;1936), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Taunton on 30 August 1856, the eldest son and second child of Charles Alfred Ballance, silk throwster, and his wife, Caroline Hendebourck, daughter of Samuel Hendebourck Pollard, of Taunton. He was educated first at Taunton College, then in Germany, and finally at St Thomas's Hospital, where he graduated MB (London) with first-class honours. He became aural surgeon at St Thomas's in 1885, and assistant surgeon to the West London Hospital. He was among the first to succeed in radical mastoid surgery. In 1882 he proceeded MS with a gold medal. In 1883 Ballance married Sophie Annie (<i>d</i>. 1926), only daughter of Alfred Smart, of Blackheath; they had one son and five daughters.<br>
<br>Ballance was elected assistant surgeon at St Thomas's in 1891, surgeon in 1900, and consulting surgeon in 1919; he was also surgeon with Victor Horsley at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, in Queen Square (1891&#150;1908). During the First World War he was a consultant with the rank of colonel in the Army Medical Service in Malta, and he was appointed CB in 1916 and KCMG in 1918. He was president of the Medical Society of London in 1906, a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1910 and its vice-president from 1920 to 1921, and the first president of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons in 1927. He was chief surgeon to the Metropolitan Police from 1912 to 1926.<br>
<br>Ballance approached surgical problems through physiological experiments on living animals, in the tradition of John Hunter. Some of his methods were superseded in his lifetime&#151;for instance, his technique for ligation of large arteries. His work with Charles Sherrington, published in 1889 in the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span>, on the formation of scar tissue, added significantly to contemporary knowledge. Ballance was a general surgeon who favoured aural and neurological surgery. In <span class="italic">Some Points in the Surgery of the Brain and its Membranes</span> (1907), he surveyed a field in which he had been an early practitioner, and his scholarly <span class="italic">Essays on the Surgery of the Temporal Bone</span> (2 vols., 1919) recorded his valuable contributions over thirty years. The repair of nerves was his chief interest. With James Purves-Stewart he wrote <span class="italic">The Healing of Nerves</span> (1901), and he applied their findings in the treatment of facial palsy. In 1919 he gave the Bradshaw lecture, on the surgery of the heart, to the Royal College of Surgeons. In the United States of America, in 1932, he studied the development of nerve grafts, and finally in London he developed a complicated cross-suture of divided nerves. In 1933 he gave the Lister memorial lecture and was awarded the Lister memorial medal. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow and Malta.<br>
<br>Ballance was a large and imposing figure. A slow, deliberate manner hid his cultivation and charm. He died a widower, at his home, 34 St John's Wood Court, London, on 8 February 1936.<br>
