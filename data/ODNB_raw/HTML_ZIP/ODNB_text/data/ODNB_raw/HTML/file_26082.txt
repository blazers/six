<span class="headword">Sparke,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a native of Kent; the names of his parents are as yet unknown. He matriculated as a sizar at Clare College, Cambridge, in Easter term 1626, graduated BA in 1630, and proceeded MA in 1633. He was created BD in 1640 and was incorporated at Oxford on 12 July 1653. He was created DD in 1660. On 15 September 1641 his first wife, Sarah (1615/16&#150;1641), aged twenty-five, &#145;dy'dst to give another life!&#146; according to one of Sparke's verses, &#145;Tears and Flowers Strew'd upon the Hearse of Mrs S.S.&#146;  (Sparke, <span class="italic">Appendix sacra</span>, sig. C4).<br>
<br>Sparke was preacher at St Mary's, Islington, in January 1638 when he delivered the funeral sermon of the herald Henry Chitting. He was instituted to the rectory of St Martin Pomeroy, Ironmonger Lane, London, on 28 September 1639, but was ejected during the civil war and according to a royalist newsletter was &#145;plundred by the Rebels&#146;  (Newcourt, 1.412). On 1 December 1646 a fifth of the income of the living was granted to his second wife, Martha. On 30 November 1650 the living was declared vacant by his resignation. In 1650 he was vicar of the Isle of Grain, Kent, to which he had been presented by Sir Edward Hales. By 1654 he was minister at St James's, Clerkenwell, where in July he buried a daughter, Elizabeth, and three years later his third wife, Judith. He retained this living until 1665; at the Restoration he also regained St Martin Pomeroy, Ironmonger Lane, and became a chaplain to Charles II. He resigned from St Martin's on 5 June 1661 and was instituted to the vicarage of Walthamstow in December 1662, which he held until he resigned and exchanged it for the vicarage of Tottenham, Middlesex, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Sparke's most important work was <span class="italic">Scintillula altaris, or, A pious reflection on primitive devotion, as to the feasts and fasts of the Christian church, orthodoxally revived</span>, first published in 1652 and reprinted seven times between 1660 and 1700. A long work, much of it written in poetic form, it detailed the lives of saints and various feast and fast days. The verses, many of which found the pun on Sparke's name irresistible (and whose authors included Thomas Fuller and Isaak Walton) underlined the work as an assertion of Anglican values in a time of adversity. Henry Delaune lauded the &#145;Bright shining Sparke of consecrated fire&#146;, while Thomas Shirley, mourning the distressed state of the church, proclaimed:<blockquote>
<div>In her eclipse no Herbert, not a Donne,<br>
</div>
<div>SPARKE only sings her Resurrection.<br>
</div> (Sparke, <span class="italic">Scintillula altaris</span>, no pagination)</blockquote>Sparke's book was a positive celebration of the rites and religious calendar of the Church of England: &#145;All being done decently and in Order, and tending only to Gods Honour, his Saints Memory, and our Edification&#146;, but without these, he warned, &#145;('tis too visible) Religion will soon languish, and even die away be degrees, into Profanenesse, Heresie and Atheisme&#146;  (ibid., 5). Later editions of the work contain an engraved portrait of the author.<br>
<br>Sparke died in 1693, between the making of his will on 2 May 1693 and its proving by his executors on 25 September. He requested to be buried on the site of his old church (which after the great fire had become the churchyard of St Olave Jewry), in a black-marble-topped tomb where the chancel had been. A son, Edward Sparke, a graduate of St John's College, Oxford, had died in 1675, and his will mentions only one child living, a daughter, Sarah Lister, wife of Matthew Lister. Sparke was survived by his (presumably fourth) wife, Ruth.<br>
