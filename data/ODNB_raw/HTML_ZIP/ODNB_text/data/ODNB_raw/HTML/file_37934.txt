<span class="headword">Sanger,  Sophy</span>  (1881&#150;1950), <span class="occ">internationalist and labour-law reformer</span>, was born on 3 January 1881 in Westcott, near Dorking, Surrey, the youngest of the three sons and three daughters of a wealthy London businessman, Charles Sanger, and his wife, Jessie Alice Pulford; Sophy was the sister of C. P. Sanger (1871&#150;1930), the legal authority on wills and friend of Bertrand Russell. She was educated at Dr Elizabeth Dawes's school, Weybridge, and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read mathematics (1899&#150;1902) and then moral sciences, narrowly missing a first in 1903. She was converted to pacifism by the Quaker Hilda Clark while at university during the South African War.<br>
<br>From 1903 to 1909 Sophy Sanger worked with Mary Reid Macarthur (later Anderson) and Margaret Bondfield for the Women's Trade Union League, setting up its legal advice bureau while studying labour law at University College, London, mastering insurance regulations for workers' compensation and interviewing women factory inspectors on conditions in the workplace. At the age of twenty-three she was called to give evidence on workmen's compensation before a parliamentary commission in the House of Lords and she also helped Labour MPs prepare their case for the <span class="roman">Shops Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Sophy Sanger soon realized that many of the worst evils of working life&#151;occupational disease, industrial injury, and sweated labour&#151;could be combated only by effective international action. Therefore, in 1905, she set up a British section of the International Association for Labour Legislation, and soon, with the help of volunteer translators, was bringing out an English edition of its French and German <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>. Between 1909 and 1919 Sophy Sanger edited and largely wrote the quarterly <span class="italic">World's Labour Laws</span>, which campaigned internationally on such issues as the abolition of child labour, the prohibition of the use of white phosphorus and lead, and the prevention of anthrax. It was Sophy Sanger's belief that by co-operating internationally for such practical, specific reforms, human beings might evolve into peaceful internationalists. The First World War, therefore, came as a terrible blow, but she persevered in keeping alive both the British section of the International Association for Labour Legislation and the <span class="italic">World's Labour Laws</span>&#151;to such effect that in February 1919 it was she who wrote the draft to the Paris commission on the basis of the International Labour Office to be established by the Versailles treaty. When the ILO was set up in Geneva, Sophy Sanger was appointed chief of its legislative section, a post she held until 1924, when she was edged out of the organization by Albert Thomas, the director.<br>
<br>On her return to Britain in 1924, Sophy Sanger read for the bar at Gray's Inn, qualifying in June 1928. However, she never practised, and neither did she publish more than an (authoritative) article on labour law for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. She had been an exemplary, modest public servant, hoping to build a more just world. Her life's motto was Goethe's &#145;Law alone can give us freedom.&#146; She died on 7 December 1950 in Cambridge, nursed by her lifelong companion, Maud Allen. She was unmarried.<br>
