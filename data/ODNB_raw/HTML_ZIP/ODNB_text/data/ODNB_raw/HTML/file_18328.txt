</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mathew,  Theobald</span>  (1790&#150;1856), <span class="occ">Capuchin friar and temperance campaigner</span>, was the fourth son of Ann Mathew, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whyte, and James Mathew, a cousin of Francis Mathew of Thomastown Castle near Cashel in co. Tipperary. James, who was descended from a Catholic line of the family, had been adopted by Francis, who had conformed to the established church to secure his property and later became the earl of Llandaff, and was employed by Francis as an agent at Thomastown Castle, where Theobald was born on 10 October 1790. While the title derives from the family's Welsh origins, the Mathews's association with Tipperary went back to the seventeenth century, when George Mathew of Llandaff in Glamorgan married the widow of Viscount Thurles.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>Mathew spent much of his childhood at Thomastown Castle, even after his father took a farm at nearby Rathcloheen, and Lady Elizabeth Mathew, who was later to inherit the castle and estate, took an interest in his education. He attended a school in Thurles and, in 1800&#150;07, a school in Kilkenny (which later became St Kieran's College). In 1807 he went to St Patrick's College, Maynooth, to train for the priesthood, but left about 1809 when he was caught entertaining some friends in his room, which was considered a serious breach of college regulations. He continued his studies for the priesthood, this time in the Capuchin order of Franciscans in Dublin, and at Easter 1814 was ordained by Dr Daniel Murray who later, as archbishop of Dublin, was to become a firm supporter of Mathew's temperance work. While an assistant priest in a poor parish in Kilkenny, Mathew was wrongly accused of a breach of regulations concerning the administration of paschal communion, and was transferred in late 1814 to Cork by the provincial of his order.<br>
<br>In Cork, Mathew was assigned as assistant to a Father Donovan at a chapel known as the Little Friary in Blackamoor Lane, a poor part of the city. He gained a reputation for his non-sectarian outlook in religion and politics, and as an effective preacher of charity sermons. Above all, he became known for his concern for the poor of Cork city. He set up schools for both boys and girls, organized charities for the poor and visits to the sick, and founded a cemetery in the south of the city where the Catholic poor could be interred free or for a nominal charge. He noticed that, in a city where brewing and distilling were major industries, many of the problems of the poor were related to excessive drinking.<h2>
<a name="Thetemperancemovement"></a>The temperance movement</h2>There had been temperance societies in Cork city from 1831, but as they were promoted mainly by Anglicans, Quakers, and other protestant nonconformists few Catholics had joined them. By the time Mathew was persuaded publicly to promote temperance by agreeing to become leader of the Cork Teetotal Society in 1838, the earlier pledge to drink in moderation had given way to a teetotal pledge which demanded total abstinence from all alcoholic drink except when prescribed for medicinal purposes. The public attachment of such a well-loved and charismatic figure as Mathew to the temperance cause enabled the movement to grow rapidly, especially among the Catholic poor in the city, and by the end of 1838, 6000 people had taken the pledge. Teetotal &#145;missionaries&#146; were sent to towns around co. Cork, and by the autumn of 1839 crowds were arriving daily from all over Ireland to take the pledge in person from Mathew.<br>
<br>At the end of 1839 Mathew conducted the first of many crusades outside Cork when he spent several days administering the pledge to large numbers in Limerick, where the native population had been swelled by thousands who had come into the city from the surrounding countryside. This was followed by equally successful missions in Waterford, Clonmel, Galway, and Dublin, and by 1842 almost every district in Ireland had been reached by one of his missions. In 1842 he made the exaggerated claim that 5 million people had taken the pledge, but even half that figure would have justified J. G. Kohl's reference to the enormous numbers flocking to take the pledge as &#145;extraordinary occurrences, for which the historian can hardly find a parallel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Travels in Ireland</span>, 1844, 100).<br>
<br>Temperance societies were established in towns throughout the country, providing mutual support for members who had pledged themselves to avoid drinking in a society where drinking had previously played such an important part. They organized confessional meetings and social gatherings, provided coffee houses and reading rooms, founded provident and savings schemes for members, and arranged processions with temperance bands and banners that offered an alternative to the drink-related entertainments of the fair day, the pattern, and the racecourse. Mathew reinforced these new attitudes by visiting and revisiting towns, encouraging teetotallers to persist with the pledge, and, while he was careful to explain that the pledge entailed no vow in the religious sense, many of his supporters at a local level were less scrupulous, and stories were current about the misfortunes that had befallen those who abandoned the pledge. But whether maintained by Mathew's charismatic influence, by the work of temperance societies, by superstitious rumours, or by individual commitment to a better way of life, there can be no doubt that for a number of years the Irish temperance movement succeeded in changing habits to the extent that social pressure to drink gave way to social pressure to abstain.<br>
<br>In the years before the famine of 1845&#150;9 alcohol consumption decreased dramatically in Ireland and there was a substantial reduction in crimes, especially those relating to intoxication. Although other factors besides Mathew's work contributed to those improvements, and the improvements did not endure into the second half of the century, many people who knew Ireland well saw his crusade as having a lasting effect on Irish life. One of them, Samuel Hall, writing fifteen years after Mathew's death, noted that while heavy drinking had once been acceptable in Ireland it was no longer so, but had become &#145;a shame and a reproach&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Book of Memories of Great Men and Women of the Age</span>, 1871, 409).<br>
<br>From 1842 the number of Mathew's crusades around Ireland began to decrease, partly because of his chaotic financial situation. This had come about by his poor financial organization, by parishes failing to reimburse him for medals he had bought and distributed, by his generous contribution to charities, and by his hopes of a legacy from Lady Elizabeth Mathew, the heir to the Thomastown estates, who, when she died in 1842, left him nothing. Attempts to raise money by public subscription to enable his work to continue met with only limited success because he was resentful of the interference that was thought necessary to put his financial affairs in order.<h2>
<a name="InEngland"></a>In England</h2>Mathew made a successful visit to Scotland in 1842, and although he had been invited to England as early as 1840 did not take up the offer of a major crusade there until the summer of 1843. The timing was partly determined by his wish to be away from Ireland while Daniel O'Connell's campaign for the repeal of the union with Britain was reaching its height. While he was not opposed to repeal, he was reluctant to have his temperance movement associated with it; but, as great numbers of people belonged to both movements, it was proving impossible to keep the two apart. Despite Mathew's opposition, many temperance bands were taking part in repeal meetings, and repeal speakers were referring to his work as Ireland's preparation for self-government.<br>
<br>Mathew was unable to escape from political and religious issues in England, however, where some newspapers, such as the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, insisted on associating his movement with repeal and with &#145;popery&#146;. His refusal to allow political issues to be raised on his platforms and his consistent respect for the representatives of all creeds that he encountered in England, as in Ireland, were sufficient to deflect the most prejudiced criticisms, and there was general approval of his work in the Irish quarters of English cities. There was opposition from brewers, who were suspected of offering free beer to men to disrupt some of his meetings in London. A few Catholic clergymen also had reservations about his mission, fearing it would interfere with the prospects of employment for Irish immigrants in England. Having pledged 200,000 people, most of them Irish, Mathew returned to Ireland in September 1843 in time to witness the decline in repeal agitation that followed the government's banning of the &#145;monster&#146; meeting planned for Clontarf.<h2>
<a name="InIrelandandtheUnitedStates"></a>In Ireland and the United States</h2>From as early as 1840 there had been suspicions that some of Mathew's supporters were breaking their pledges. Cordials containing alcohol and dispensations from doctors were among the stratagems employed by waverers to adhere to the letter, if not the spirit, of the pledge. With the onset of the famine there were increased accusations that many were abandoning the pledge, accusations which Mathew vigorously denied. In time he had to accept, however, that in the great social disruption that accompanied the potato failure of the late 1840s many of his followers would die of starvation, many would emigrate, and many of those who remained in Ireland would abandon the pledge for ever.<br>
<br>From 1846 Mathew's own energies became increasingly absorbed in famine relief work, although he continued to make regular, if less frequent, visits to promote temperance. He was on the Cork Relief Committee and worked tirelessly soliciting aid from abroad, advising and assisting government relief officers, publicizing the virtues of the controversial &#145;yellow meal&#146;, and even turning his own home in Cove Street into a soup kitchen for the starving.<br>
<br>Mathew was disappointed not to have been appointed bishop of Cork by the Vatican, having been the preferred candidate of the clergy of the diocese. Some of the Irish bishops, while supporting his crusade against drink, were suspicious of what they saw as his accommodating attitude towards British power in Ireland. He suffered an attack of paralysis, probably brought on from overwork, in 1848, from which he made a rapid but incomplete recovery.<br>
<br>In 1849 Mathew went to America, where he immediately became embroiled in a series of controversies. Catholics and protestants in New York vied with one other to welcome him, Irish nationalist immigrants condemned him for having received a pension from the British government in 1848 as a solution to his financial problems, abolitionists vilified him for not condemning slavery in public in America as he had done in Ireland seven years earlier, and politicians from southern states denounced him for having condemned slavery in the first place. He successfully steered his way through the various minefields, and large numbers, mostly Irish Americans, took the pledge in hundreds of towns and cities in twenty-five states over a period of two and a half years. His exertions in America weakened him further, and after his return to Ireland in December 1851 he was unable to take part in any further temperance crusades, although people continued to visit Mathew at his brother's home, where he was living, at Lehenagh near Cork to take the pledge.<h2>
<a name="Deathandinfluence"></a>Death and influence</h2>Father Mathew had a stroke early in 1856 and died on 8 December of the same year at Queenstown, near Cork. His friend and biographer, John Francis Maguire, recorded that he left no property except his watch and the altar plate and sacred vestments which belonged to him as a priest, so it was perhaps appropriate that he was buried in the cemetery which he founded many years earlier for the poor of Cork.<br>
<br>Considered attractive as a child, Mathew retained his good looks into middle age. Kohl described him in 1842 as having the same height and figure as Napoleon, &#145;really a handsome man&#146;, with a fresh complexion, large eyes, and a nose that was &#145;a little too arched in the middle&#146;  (J. G. Kohl, <span class="italic">Travels in Ireland</span>, 1844, 97). W. M. Thackeray, who met him the same year, recalled &#145;a stout, handsome, honest-looking man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Irish Sketch Book</span>, 1843, 113). Towards the end of his life, Mathew acknowledged that his cherished aim of banishing drunkenness from Ireland had not been achieved and he became more sympathetic towards legislative changes to prevent the abuse of alcohol. His personal influence on the Irish temperance movement was enormous, however, and several successful campaigns against drink in the late nineteenth century, both in Ireland and among the Irish in Britain, owed their inspiration to him and to those of his followers who had kept the pledge. The wider influence of his work, especially the activities of the temperance societies he encouraged, has been controversially viewed by H. F. Kearney as contributing to the modernization of Irish life. While there will continue to be discussion among historians on the influence of his work, his enigmatic personality&#151;with his single-minded commitment to opposing drunkenness and his reputation for personal sanctity&#151;will ensure that he remains a revered figure among the heroes of nineteenth-century Ireland.<br>
