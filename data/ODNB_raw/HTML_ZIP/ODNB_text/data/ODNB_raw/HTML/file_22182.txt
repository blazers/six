<span class="headword">Philpott <span class="st"> [Philpot]</span>,  John</span>  (1515/16&#150;1555), <span class="occ">clergyman and protestant martyr</span>, was born at Compton Waselyn, Hampshire, the third son of Sir Peter Philpott (<i>c</i>.1488&#150;1540) and Anne Troyes of Owlesbury, Hampshire. His father was a prominent member of the Hampshire gentry who served as sheriff for that county in 1524&#150;5 and 1535&#150;6, and as justice of the peace from 1523 to 1540. Unlike his son Sir Peter does not appear to have wavered in his loyalty to the old religion.<br>
<br>John Philpott entered Winchester College at ten years of age as a scholar in 1526. There he showed great aptitude for making friends, and for classical and biblical languages. On one occasion he made a bet of 20<i>d</i>. with his classmate John Harpesfield that he could compose 200 verses in Latin in one night with no more than three errors. Philpott won. Hebrew, however, seems to have been the ancient language for which he had the greatest love and the greatest talent, and he would become one of Oxford University's earliest Hebraists. On 27 January 1533 he was admitted as a scholar to New College, Oxford. New College, which was home to some of Oxford's earliest protestants during the 1530s and 1540s, made him a fellow in 1535. Some time before May 1541 he went to study in Italy, and visited Venice, Padua, and Rome. While in Italy he may have earned the degree of BCL. Always outspoken in his opinions, he also made no attempt to disguise his disapproval of scholastic theology and of the laxity of living that prevailed in the Italian church. While travelling from Venice to Padua he engaged in a heated discussion of the condition and learning of the Italian church with a learned Franciscan. Philpott's opinions so enraged the Franciscan that he threatened to denounce him to the Inquisition, although he never carried out his threat. Meanwhile in May 1541 New College deprived him of his fellowship because of his being absent beyond the time allowed by the college statutes.<br>
<br>Just when Philpott returned to England is not clear, but he was certainly in the vicinity of Hampshire by late 1548. There is some reason to believe that Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, had earlier promised to make the promising young scholar his archdeacon of Winchester. By 1548, however, Philpott had developed into a fervent protestant, and the conservative Gardiner would no longer honour his commitment. Just when his conversion occurred is uncertain. The contributing causes, however, are fairly obvious. The ferment of protestantism in England in general and in New College in particular during the mid-1530s would have been a big influence, as were his travels during the early 1540s in unreformed, pre-Tridentine, Italy. Back home in Hampshire he engaged in several bitter confrontations with Bishop Gardiner and other local adherents of the old religion. Gardiner refused to allow Philpott to preach in his diocese, but Philpott disobeyed him. The Oxford antiquary Anthony Wood later reported that Philpott lectured on the book of <span class="roman">Romans</span> in the cathedral for no fee, and that his interpretation was displeasing to the Catholic clergy and laity of Winchester. It is equally clear that Philpott also had his staunch supporters.<br>
<br>The Edwardian government's deprivation of Gardiner as bishop of Winchester on 14 February 1551 resulted in his quick replacement by the protestant John Ponet on 23 March. A year later Ponet made Philpott his archdeacon of Winchester, with Philpott compounding for his first fruits on 27 May 1552. Unfortunately the two protestant clerics soon fell into a quarrel incited by the unsavoury diocesan registrar, John Cooke. Cooke informed Ponet that Philpott owed him a yearly pension. When pressed to pay Philpott refused. It is possible that Philpott harboured bad feelings toward Ponet because he considered himself to be better qualified to be a bishop. In an effort to curry favour with Ponet, Cooke went so far as to gather some of his servants and ambushed Philpott on one of the roads outside of Winchester. Philpott defended himself stoutly, but was overwhelmed and badly beaten. Despite Cooke's heinous actions, Ponet refused to give Philpott justice. Eventually the privy council intervened in the dispute on 21 July 1552, and ordered Philpott to submit to Ponet and to pay the pension. From that point onward the two men were on good terms.<br>
<br>The death of Edward VI on 6 July 1553 resulted in Ponet's deprivation and Gardiner's restoration as bishop of Winchester, although Philpott remained archdeacon for the time being. An unbending protestant, he spoke against the real presence and other Roman Catholic doctrines at the Canterbury convocation held at St Paul's, London, during October 1553. He also excommunicated John White, another conservative who was treasurer of Winchester diocese and who became bishop of Lincoln on 1 April 1554, for preaching &#145;naughty doctrine&#146;. By March 1554 Philpott had been deprived as archdeacon, excommunicated, and placed in the king's bench prison. It was then that he began writing a series of twenty pastoral letters to fellow protestants which were preserved and later printed by John Foxe and Miles Coverdale. In these letters he encouraged his friends, male and female, and also his fellow prisoners John Careless and Robert Glover, to remain steadfast in their faith during the time of persecution, and to go into exile or suffer martyrdom if the need arose. Further examinations by the authorities led in October 1554 to his being transferred to the bishop of London's coalhouse prison, along with other protestants. Bishop Bonner later put him in solitary confinement in a tower of St Paul's Cathedral. After examining him thirteen times between 2 October and 5 December 1555, Bonner and others condemned the unrepentant Philpott for heresy on 16 December. During that time Philpott managed to keep a record of his examinations and had it smuggled out of prison. John Foxe soon published it in the Latin and English versions of his <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>. On 18 December 1555 the authorities conveyed Philpott to Smithfield to be burnt. The ground was particularly foul that day and two sheriff's officers tried to carry Philpott to the stake so that he would not dirty his feet. Witty to the end, Philpott quipped &#145;What! Will ye make me a pope? I am content to go to my journey's end on foot&#146;. Upon reaching the stake he then knelt and said &#145;I will pay my vows to thee, O Smithfield&#146;  (Eden, 161). Proceeding to his place of execution he kissed the stake; recited <span class="roman">Psalms</span> 106, 107, and 108; paid his executioners; and went to his death by the flames calmly. His body was consumed by the fire. While he published nothing during his lifetime, some of his manuscripts relating to his martyrdom were published by his fellow protestants at Emden about 1557, along with his treatise against Arianism. Other writings on the study of languages, <span class="italic">Epistolae Hebraicae</span> and <span class="italic">De proprietate linguarum</span>, and his translations of homilies by John Calvin and Chrysostom against heresy have been lost.<br>
