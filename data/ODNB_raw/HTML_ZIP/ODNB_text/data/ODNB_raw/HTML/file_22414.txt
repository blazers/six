<span class="headword">Plunket,  Thomas</span>, Baron Plunket in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1716&#150;1779), <span class="occ">army officer in the Austrian service</span>, a kinsman of Lord Dunsany, was born in Ireland. After entering the Austrian army he fought in Turkey and in the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1746, as a colonel and adjutant-general of the army in Italy, he much distinguished himself, and in the following year he was sent to Genoa as bearer of the imperial pardon to that republic. He served throughout the Seven Years' War. In 1757, by capturing the obstinately defended village of Krzeszow, he greatly contributed to the victory of Kollin. The cross of the order of Maria Theresa, which conferred the title of baron, was consequently awarded him on 4 December 1758. In the following year he was in command of eight Austrian regiments in Saxony. In 1763 he was nominated general. On St Patrick's day 1766 Plunket attended the dinner given at Vienna to men of Irish extraction by Count Demetrius O'Mahony, the Spanish ambassador. In 1770 he was appointed governor of Antwerp, which post he held until his death on 20 January 1779.<br>
<br>Plunket married Mary D'Alton, probably a sister of Richard and Edward D'Alton, Austrian generals, and had a son, an Austrian officer, killed at the siege of Belgrade in 1789, and a daughter, Mary Bridget Charlotte Josephine. Born at Louvain in 1759, she was educated at the English Austin nunnery in Paris, and married in 1787 the marquis de Chastellux, who died on 26 October 1788; she was later lady-in-waiting to the duchess of Orl&eacute;ans. Gouverneur Morris (1752&#150;1816), the American minister to France from 1792 to 1794, knew her late husband and attended her salon in Paris, where he was introduced to the duchess of Orl&eacute;ans and other members of the court. In November 1793 Madame de Chastellux was imprisoned in the Austin nunnery, her old school, along with a group of British subjects. According to Alger, her detention was on account of her aristocratic marriage and likely involvement in the flight of several members of the king's family. She escaped the guillotine and was released in November 1794; she remained in Paris, where she died on 18 December 1815. Her son Alfred (<i>b</i>. 1789) became an equerry to Princess Adelaide, the sister of Louis-Philippe, was a deputy (1832&#150;42), and was created a peer of France in 1845.<br>
