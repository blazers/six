<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1743&#150;1818), <span class="occ">minister of the New Connexion of General Baptists</span>, was born on 16 June 1743 at Fold in the township of Northowram in the parish of Halifax, the fourth of eight children of Azor Taylor, coalminer, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Willey of Fold. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27023/', "Dan Taylor (1738&#150;1816)")</script>, the founder of the New Connexion of General Baptists. John was put to work in a coalmine in 1749. Such education as he had came from his mother and brother Dan. The home was not particularly religious although his parents attended the parish church. It was his brother Dan who stimulated his spiritual interests. By the time John was eleven he and his brother were reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and praying together. He met for worship with the local Methodists for a number of years but never joined a class or became a member of the society. He was drawn to the Particular Baptist cause in Halifax, and this resulted in discussion and debate with his brother Dan who, as a consequence of his Methodist background and Arminian theology, was strongly opposed to Calvinism. Doctrinal differences between the brothers were resolved, and when his brother started an Independent church at Wadsworth John became a member, was baptized on 7 March 1770, and subsequently started preaching. On 22 April 1764 he had married Betty Whitely (<i>d</i>. 1806) at Halifax.<br>
<br>When a church was formed at Queenshead, near Halifax, John Taylor was ordained its first pastor on 30 September 1773. The ordination took place in the context of personal tragedy: his three-year-old daughter died on the evening of the ordination and his son at the end of the week on the Friday; both died from smallpox. The infant church had a troubled early history: internal problems, together with poverty and a heavy debt on the church building, resulted in little progress. For most of his ministry John Taylor worked either as a miner or wool-comber. Although he received invitations to more prosperous churches he complied with the request of the New Connexion's assembly to continue his ministry at Queenshead. He had a thirst for knowledge, was self-taught, and read widely. Theologically a General Baptist he was much influenced by the evangelical revival, &#145;I preach experience&#146;, he said  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 63). He wrote a manuscript autobiography and two &#145;Association letters&#146;, &#145;Family worship&#146; in 1790 and &#145;The religious education of children&#146; in 1810.<br>
<br>In the early stages of the development of the New Connexion, formed in 1770, John assisted his brother Dan, thereby giving him more time to travel the county on connexion business. His own ministry involved a considerable amount of travel, preaching and meeting the pastoral needs of the churches of the connexion: &#145;For two years I was not one Lord's day more than half my time at home&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 37). In 1795 he lost sight in one eye; his son Adam attributed this to the &#145;fatigues of so many journeys, during the winter season&#146;  (ibid., 63). The effect was to curtail his travels. Although he was assisted by a number of young preachers their tenure was short, usually as a result of being called to minister elsewhere.<br>
<br>The area around Queenshead suffered badly during the depression at the turn of the century. In January 1801 Taylor described the distress this caused as &#145;inexpressible&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 74). Following his wife's death in March 1806 he married &#145;a poor but worthy widow&#146; in November of that year. The final years of his life were marked by increasing debility. He died at Queenshead on 26 December 1818. A man whose ministry was exercised in adverse circumstances, Taylor had a reputation for piety and devotion. His two sons, Adam and James, also became ministers in the connexion, and the elder, Adam, wrote an early history of the connexion.<br>
