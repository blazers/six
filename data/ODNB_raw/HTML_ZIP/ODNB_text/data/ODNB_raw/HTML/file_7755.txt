</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dodsley,  Robert</span>  (1704&#150;1764), <span class="occ">bookseller and writer</span>, was born on 13 February 1704 in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the eldest of seven children of Robert Dodsley (<i>bap</i>. 1681, <i>d</i>. 1750), a master of the free school in Mansfield, and his first wife. Robert's early efforts at poetry suggest that he learned something of the art from his schoolmaster father, as well as a smattering of major authors, both classical and contemporary. However, in a practical-minded move, his father apprenticed Robert, at the age of fourteen, to a local stocking weaver. It is not clear when Robert left his master or under what circumstances, but by the mid-1720s he entered into service with a series of well-connected families that eventually took him to London.<br>
<br>The first known verses of the aspiring young poet were composed while Dodsley was in the service of Sir Richard Howe, who kept a residence both at Langar Hall, east of Nottingham, and at Compton, in Gloucestershire. At some time before September 1729 Dodsley became a footman to Charles Dartiquenave, a well-known London epicure, friend of Swift and Pope, member of the Kitcat Club, and contributor to <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. Dodsley's first publication, <span class="italic">Servitude</span>, a poem attempting to counter the increasing displeasure with the attitude of servants, appeared on 20 September 1729. At Dartiquenave's Dodsley became acquainted with visiting literati and probably first met Alexander Pope, who would later play a major role in his young career. Within two years Dodsley had moved to Whitehall as footman to Jane Lowther, a daughter of John, Viscount Lonsdale. On 14 February 1732, while still in Mrs Lowther's service, Dodsley married Catherine Iserloo (<i>d</i>. 1754), the beloved Kitty of his early poems. A little more than two months later, Mrs Lowther engaged a host of her fashionable friends to subscribe to Dodsley's <span class="italic">A Muse in Livery, or, The Footman's Miscellany</span>, his most significant publication to date (the first edition had appeared in February). The more than 200 subscribers included Sir Robert Walpole, the countess of Hartford, and the duchesses of Bolton, Bedford, and Cleveland. Not until the &#145;second&#146; edition, however, did Nourse, the publisher, add to the title-page: &#145;By R. Dodsley, now a Footman to a Person of Quality at Whitehall&#146;.<br>
<br>The earliest remnant of Dodsley's acquaintance with Pope, a brief letter from the older poet on 5 February 1733, acknowledged the receipt of Dodsley's manuscript of <span class="italic">The Toy-Shop</span> and promised to recommend the one-act play to John Rich, manager of Covent Garden theatre. Pope kept his word, and Rich produced <span class="italic">The Toy-Shop</span> as an afterpiece on 3 February 1735. A moralizing satire on the town's vanities delivered by the toyshop owner himself, the play captured the fancy of audiences and enjoyed at least thirty-four performances and seven editions in its first year alone.<h2>
<a name="ShopatthesignofTullysHead"></a>Shop at the sign of Tully's Head</h2>Although Pope had encouraged young Dodsley's poetic aspirations, apparently his own publishing agenda led him to convince Dodsley that his true talents would be realized in the book trade. Lacking experience in the bookselling business, Dodsley probably spent time learning the trade in the shop of Pope's current publisher, Lawton Gilliver, while Gilliver was publishing Dodsley's next three poems&#151;<span class="italic">The Modern Reasoners</span> (1734), <span class="italic">An Epistle to Mr. Pope, Occasion'd by his Essay on Man</span> (1734), and <span class="italic">Beauty, or, The Art of Charming</span> (1735).<br>
<br>With proceeds from <span class="italic">The Toy-Shop</span> and other works, together with a &pound;100 contribution from Pope, Dodsley opened his bookshop at the sign of Tully's Head in Pall Mall, London, probably in March or April 1735. Not surprisingly, his first publication found him linked in the imprint with Lawton Gilliver and James Brindley for volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</span>. The original site of Tully's Head is not known, but, three years later, he moved into the former quarters of Sir William Younge in Pall Mall, a large house at the end of a passageway almost directly opposite Marlborough House and running up towards King Street. Although some distance from the centre of the book trade around Stationers' Corner, Tully's Head was near the fashionable coffee houses in St James's, a short walk from parliament and government offices in Whitehall, and had no serious competition in the area, except for Brindley in New Bond Street.<br>
<br>During these early years Pope channelled several of his own works to Tully's Head and recommended the shop to his friends. To William Duncombe, he wrote on 6 May 1735: &#145;Mr. Dodsley, the Author of <span class="roman">the Toyshop</span> &hellip; has just set up a Bookseller, and I doubt not, as he has more Sense, so will have more Honesty, than most of [that] Profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Sherburn, 3.454). In 1737 Dodsley issued nine publications, including a volume of Pope's letters (together with Knapton, Gilliver, and Brindley); an edition of still another of his own plays, <span class="italic">The King and the Miller of Mansfield</span>; and the year's most popular work, Richard Glover's political epic <span class="italic">Leonidas</span>. The next year saw twenty-one new works, including <span class="italic">London</span> by the not yet famous Samuel Johnson, an edition of F&eacute;n&eacute;lon's <span class="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>, a translation of Tasso's <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, a few more poems by Pope, and another of Dodsley's own plays, <span class="italic">Sir John Cockle at Court</span>. By 1739 Dodsley had begun to mount sufficient reserves to publish several multi-volume works on his own, including two-volume editions of Mrs Rowe's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Sir Isaac Newton</span>, and Roger Boyle's <span class="italic">Dramatic Works</span>.<br>
<br>In the same year Dodsley's brief publishing career suffered a formal blow when he was prosecuted for publishing Paul Whitehead's <span class="italic">Manners</span>, a satire on various court figures and prelates. Bishop Thomas Sherlock, one of Whitehead's targets, induced the House of Lords to summon both author and publisher to Westminster Hall. Although Whitehead absconded to avoid prosecution, Dodsley was reprimanded and ordered to be detained in custody until further notice. A week later, upon the intercession of Dodsley's Pall Mall neighbour Benjamin Victor, a petition for his release was filed by one of Whitehead's victims, Lord Essex. After a formal apology upon his knees in the Lords and the payment of a &pound;70 fine, Dodsley was released. As Alexander Chalmers later commented, &#145;The whole process, indeed, was supposed to be intended rather to intimidate Pope, than to punish Whitehead&#146;  (Chalmers, 16.201).<br>
<br>Dodsley had not been wholly innocent in the Whitehead affair. A decade of service in aristocratic gatherings had acquainted him with arrogance and incompetence in high places, and, early on, he had begun to resent the haughty imposition of a privileged social class. His struggle to reconcile his sense of his own genius with the humiliations he was forced to endure as a footman were vividly expressed in his <span class="italic">Miseries of Poverty</span> (1731). <span class="italic">The Toy-Shop</span> of 1735 had indicted the vanities and pretensions of aristocrats and clergymen. In the opening scene of his second play, <span class="italic">The King and the Miller of Mansfield</span> (1737), Henry II, lost and alone at night in Sherwood Forest, realizes that, when not surrounded by his courtiers and flatterers, he is but a &#145;common Man&#146;; the king chastises Lord Lurewell for harassing the simple country folk and knights the humble, virtuous miller as Sir John Cockle, the titular character of Dodsley's next play  (pp. 26, 51). Also about this time, the bookseller became acquainted with Pope's circle of patriot friends&#151;George Lyttelton, Richard Glover, lords Chesterfield and Cobham, and the prince of Wales, major contributors to anti-ministerial literature. Dodsley also lent his shop to the cause by publishing Pope's satires on court and political figures: <span class="italic">The First Epistle of the First Book of Horace Imitated</span> (1737), <span class="italic">The Second Epistle of the Second Book of Horace Imitated</span> (1737), <span class="italic">One Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty Eight</span>, the last published just seven months before Whitehead's <span class="italic">Manners</span>.<h2>
<a name="The1740s"></a>The 1740s</h2>Except for 1740, Dodsley's list of publications and authors, both new and established, grew at full tilt during the 1740s. He brought out the first poems of Mark Akenside, John Brown, John Gilbert Cooper, Thomas Gray, William Mason, William Shenstone, Joseph and Thomas Warton, and William Whitehead, all of whom, except the contentious Brown, continued a long-term publishing relationship with Tully's Head. Also appearing under Dodsley's imprint for the first time were poems by William Collins, Stephen Duck, William Thompson, and Edward Young, specifically <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>. Also during the decade, he issued Johnson's <span class="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes</span>, the last works of Jonathan Swift, including <span class="italic">Directions to Servants</span>, and the tenth volume of <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, as well as various editions of Pope's <span class="italic">Works</span>.<br>
<br>Notable also was the broadening of the subjects and types of works Dodsley was publishing during the 1740s: translations of ancient and foreign authors, works on architecture, religion, philosophy, travel, and science. These included Christopher Pitt's edition of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> (1740), William Melmoth's <span class="italic">The Letters of Pliny</span> (1746), and translations of Callimachus (1744), Sallust (1744), the <span class="italic">Decameron</span> (1741), and <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1742); Joseph Spence's <span class="italic">Polymetis</span> (1747), John Wood's <span class="italic">The Origin of Building</span> (1741), George Lyttelton's <span class="italic">Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul</span> (1747), John Barr's <span class="italic">Summary of Natural Religion</span> (1749), Voltaire's <span class="italic">The Metaphysics of Sir Isaac Newton</span> (1747), William Duncan's <span class="italic">Elements of Logic</span> (1748), James Spilman's <span class="italic">Journey through Russia into Persia</span> (1742), Richard Pococke's <span class="italic">Description of the East</span> (1743), William Cheselden's <span class="italic">Anatomy of the Human Body</span> (1741), and Henry Baker's <span class="italic">The Microscope Made Easy</span> (1742) and <span class="italic">Natural History of the Polype</span> (1743).<br>
<br>The year 1741 saw the first of four periodicals Dodsley would publish during his career, the <span class="italic">Publick Register, or, The Weekly Magazine</span>. This threepenny sixteen-page weekly, containing foreign and domestic news, literary essays, and poetry, was aimed at capturing some of the market dominated by Edward Cave's monthly <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Cave met the challenge by exerting his influence in the trade, and Dodsley was forced to discontinue the periodical with the twenty-fourth number which carried the complaint: &#145;the ungenerous Usage I have met with from one of the Proprietors of a certain Monthly Pamphlet, who has prevail'd with most of the common News-Papers not to advertise it, compel me for the present to discontinue it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Publick Register</span>, 332).<br>
<br>Engaging Mark Akenside as editor, Dodsley made his second bid for the periodical market by issuing the fortnightly <span class="italic">The Museum, or, Literary and Historical Register</span> on 29 March 1746. Running regularly forty pages, the fortnightly contained literary essays, poems, book reviews, and historical essays, and attracted original contributions from a host of notables, including William Collins, Stephen Duck, David Garrick, Soame Jenyns, Samuel Johnson, Robert Lowth, George Lyttelton, Christopher Smart, Joseph Spence, Horace Walpole, William Warburton, the Warton brothers, and the future poet laureate William Whitehead. When <span class="italic">The Museum</span> was discontinued with its thirty-ninth number on 12 September 1747, once more Cave, in the preface to the collected edition of his <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1747, smugly celebrated the demise of the supposed &#145;super-excellent Magazine&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1747). Fifteen months later, Dodsley bought a quarter-share in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Gentleman</span>'s chief competitor. In the same year he purchased a share in the influential thrice-weekly <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>.<br>
<br>Dodsley's genius for envisioning new literary projects also brought to the market in the 1740s the two major works by which he is chiefly known to posterity. His love of the theatre&#151;largely bred of his own success (three of his plays running on London stages within a single month in 1738)&#151;inspired him to produce the twelve-volume <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span> (1744&#150;5). A compilation of sixty-one plays, ranging back beyond Shakespeare, the <span class="italic">Collection</span> drew upon the Harleian collection (then in his possession) and the collection of Sir Clement Dormer, to whom the work is dedicated. As announced in his preface, Dodsley's intention &#145;to snatch some of the best Pieces of our old Dramatic Writers from total Neglect and Oblivion&#146; produced an unprecedented repository of texts in the English theatre tradition to which all subsequent editors would be indebted  (<span class="italic">Select Collection</span>, 1.xxxv).<br>
<br>The advertisement to Dodsley's second major contribution to English literary history, <span class="italic">A Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span>, showed similar intent and foresight: &#145;to preserve to the public those poetical performances, which seemed to merit a longer remembrance than what would probably be secured to them by the Manner wherein they were originally published&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span>, 1748, vol. 1.iii&#150;iv). Given the extensive circle of poets Dodsley had cultivated by 1747, he had no trouble filling the first three volumes of the <span class="italic">Collection</span>, which appeared on 15 January 1748. Four editions were called for by March 1755 when Dodsley added a fourth volume, and, three years later, he completed the set with volumes 5 and 6. Although the earlier volumes showed many changes by their 1758 edition, the <span class="italic">Collection</span> set the canon for mid-eighteenth-century poetry, passing through several editions and supplements by other editors through the rest of the century. Although the earlier volumes show a disproportionate number of contributions by Dodsley's friends Shenstone and Akenside, except in the case of perhaps a half-dozen figures (including Swift and Young), its pages reflect the work of most major and minor practising poets of Dodsley's era.<br>
<br>In the late 1740s Dodsley solidified his publishing relationship with Samuel Johnson. Johnson provided the introduction and &#145;The vision of Theodore the hermit&#146; to Dodsley's two-volume <span class="italic">Preceptor</span> (1748), a compilation of essays for the education of youth on such topics as mathematics, architecture, geography, rhetoric, drawing logic, ethics, trade and commerce, and law and government. The work passed through many editions, even becoming a textbook in colonial American colleges. Also, in 1749, Dodsley published Johnson's <span class="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes</span> and his tragedy <span class="italic">Irene</span>. Within a week of the last night of <span class="italic">Irene</span>'s performance at Drury Lane, Dodsley's own masque, <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>, was acted on the same stage.<h2>
<a name="The1750s"></a>The 1750s</h2>During the 1750s Dodsley reached the zenith of his career: his book production reached new highs, he became <i>the</i> London publisher of <i>belles-lettres</i>, he introduced many significant works and new talent, and his own pen enjoyed a few triumphs. He opened the decade with his own popular compilation of moral aphorisms, <span class="italic">The Oeconomy of Human Life</span> by an &#145;Ancient Bramin&#146; (1750), a work that was soon translated into five languages and became the most frequently printed work of the entire eighteenth century. The next three years brought Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard</span>, Richard Owen Cambridge's <span class="italic">Scribleriad</span>, the first English edition of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Age of Louis XIV</span>, Christopher Pitt and Joseph Warton's edition of Virgil's <span class="italic">Works</span>, William Duncan's translation of Caesar's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, William Melmoth's translation of Cicero's <span class="italic">Letters</span>, William Popple's translation of Horace's <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span>, Edward Young's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, and, the least successful, Dodsley's own <span class="italic">Public Virtue</span>.<br>
<br>On 4 January 1753 Dodsley re-entered the periodical market with <span class="italic">The World</span>, a lively weekly on contemporary fashionable life. Immediately successful, the weekly was soon printing 2500 copies per week, ran for a full three years, and earned its conductor, Edward Moore, the amazing sum of &pound;858. Among its many contributors were lords Bath, Chesterfield, and Hailes, the earl of Cork, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, Richard O. Cambridge, Soame Jenyns, Joseph Warton, William Whitehead, and Horace Walpole. Two days after the close of <span class="italic">The World</span>, Dodsley ventured into the newspaper trade with William Strahan, publishing the first issue of their <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> on 1 January 1757. Samuel Johnson provided the introduction for this thrice weekly, which ran through to the end of the century and included many contributions from James Boswell. Dodsley's last entry in the periodical market, the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, was begun in 1758 (published in 1759) with Edmund Burke at the helm. This annual 400-page volume chronicled the previous year's major events, and printed literary, historical, and topographical essays, as well as poetry and reviews. Burke discontinued his services in the 1760s, but James Dodsley continued the publication until 1791, when it was taken over by the Rivingtons.<br>
<br>Dodsley's eminent stature in the trade during the last half of the 1750s is evident in both the number and importance of his publications. Collaborating with five other booksellers, Dodsley published one of the most notable works of the century, Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the English Language</span> (1755). Johnson later acknowledged that Dodsley had given him the idea for the dictionary and, since Dodsley had published all of his significant works to date, Johnson referred to the bookseller as &#145;Doddy &hellip; my patron&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.326).<br>
<br>Other notable first editions of these years included Edward Young's <span class="italic">Centaur not Fabulous</span> (1755), James Hampton's <span class="italic">History of Polybius</span> (1756), Thomas Blacklock's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1756), John Dyer's <span class="italic">The Fleece</span> (1757), Soame Jenyns's <span class="italic">Free Enquiry into the Origin and Nature of Evil</span> (1757), Edmund Burke's <span class="italic">Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</span> (1757), Thomas Gray's <span class="italic">Odes</span> (1757), volumes 4&#150;6 of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span> (1758), David Hume's <span class="italic">Remarks on the Natural History of Religion</span> (1758), Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe</span> (1759), and (with William Strahan and William Johnston) Johnson's <span class="italic">Rasselas</span> (1759). In 1758 Dodsley's own poetic exploration into the realm of terror and pity, <span class="italic">Melpomene</span>, appeared under Mary Cooper's imprint, and, in one week, he sold 2000 copies of his tragedy <span class="italic">Cleone</span>, as it was being acted at Covent Garden Theatre in early December. Although Dodsley baulked at the purchase of the copyright to Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> in late 1759, the first London edition would appear from the Dodsley's shop, his brother James having paid Sterne &pound;630 for volumes 1&#150;4 early the next year.<br>
<br>By the mid-1750s, Tully's Head became a fashionable gathering place of London's literati. As Joseph Warton recalled Johnson saying, &#145;The Noctes Atticae are revived at honest Dodsley's house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Tierney, 19), and Dodsley's correspondence frequently notes the visits and gatherings at Tully's Head. As his correspondence also reveals, Dodsley's regular literary advisers were Spence, Mark Akenside, George Lyttelton, and Horace Walpole. Outside London Dodsley relied heavily upon his Birmingham friend Shenstone and frequently on Shenstone's friend at Bath, Richard Graves. Besides his substantial contributions to Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span> and <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span>, Shenstone entertained Dodsley on several summer visits in the 1750s where the two would revise Dodsley's works. Graves did much the same for Dodsley's writings, although most of his advice came by letter.<br>
<br>In 1755, as one of the earliest members of the newly founded Society of Arts (then calling itself the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce), Dodsley was elected the society's first &#145;stationer&#146; and was thereby responsible for providing all of its printing and publishing. He also served, along with William Hogarth, Samuel Richardson, and Jacob and Richard Tonson, on several society committees delegated to offer rewards to the public for the execution of prescribed drawings and the invention of new processes related to paper making, as well as to judge the resulting submissions.<br>
<br>During his later years Dodsley's own pen and genius for literary projects remained active. After protracted revisions and continuing refusals by David Garrick, Dodsley's tragedy <span class="italic">Cleone</span> was finally produced by John Rich at Covent Garden on 2 December 1758, with George Anne Bellamy in the title role. The occasion found the whole town taking sides, and a bitter exchange arising between the author and his friend Garrick. In late February 1761 appeared Dodsley's <span class="italic">Select Fables of Aesop and other Fabulists</span>, printed by John Baskerville and including ancient, modern, and &#145;newly invented&#146; fables in three volumes, respectively. By his death, Dodsley, with the help of Graves, had managed to edit and publish the first few volumes of an edition of Shenstone's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1764&#150;9), as they were simultaneously serving as the poet's executors.<br>
<br>In his time, Dodsley was variously described as a man of modesty, simplicity, benevolence, humanity, and true politeness. His relations with his authors seem regularly to have been conducted with cordiality and integrity, but always moderated by practical business sense. Extant evidence of copyright purchases shows that he offered the age's standard rates for authors' manuscripts, meaning that he was consistently fair, though not overly generous. Although early contributors to Tully's Head, only William Warburton and John Brown quit Dodsley in pique. Warburton associated several attacks on his works with Dodsley authors, and, as Pope's literary executor, he thought Dodsley &#145;not very regardfull&#146; of the memory of his patron when the bookseller published such works as Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">Observations on the Faerie Queene</span> (1754), which accused Pope of prejudice and ignorance for enthroning Lewis Theobald as the &#145;prince of dullness&#146; (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Tierney, 212; Warton, 11.265). The Revd Mr Brown, fearing allusions to his penchant for cursing and swearing in Sir Charles Hanbury's forthcoming response to his <span class="italic">Estimate</span>, attempted to intimidate its publisher, but then resorted to dismissing Dodsley's mediation with &#145;Footman's language I never return&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 357).<h2>
<a name="Dodsleyandthetrade"></a>Dodsley and the trade</h2>Besides his brother James, Dodsley trained at least two other apprentices at Tully's Head, John Hinxman and John Walter. Both men advertised themselves as former Dodsley apprentices when they opened their own shops, Hinxman taking over John Hildyard's business in York in 1757 and Walter setting up at Homer's Head in Charing Cross, London, in 1759. James Dodsley left Walter &pound;1000 in his will, suggesting an ongoing relationship through the last half of the century. Hinxman returned to London in 1761 to marry Mary Cooper's sister and to take over the business of Dodsley's long-time publishing associate.<br>
<br>During his twenty-four-year career at Tully's Head, Dodsley co-published with at least fifty-three other booksellers, including the most notable members of the London trade: Charles Bathurst, Charles Hitch, Andrew Millar, the Knaptons, Rivingtons, Tonsons, and Longmans. Likewise, he collaborated with or served as the agent for a number of provincial booksellers including Joseph Bentham, Richard Clements, and James Fletcher. In the 1750s he also shipped some of his works to Dublin's George Faulkner for the issuing of Irish editions. By far, the names appearing most frequently in his imprint were those of Thomas (and later) Mary Cooper, Dodsley's City agents, who also occasionally published works with which Dodsley did not initially want his name connected.<br>
<br>Although at least thirteen printers had a hand in producing Dodsley's volumes, John Hughs seems to have been his primary printer, and the latter sometimes farmed out work to William Bowyer junior and William Strahan. John Baskerville printed Dodsley's <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span>, and the bookseller acted as the Birmingham printer's London agent for the sale of his Horace and Virgil, as well as for Baskerville's new typeface and wove paper. For the illustration of his publications, Dodsley enlisted the designing and engraving services of at least twenty-three hands, some among the best-known names in the trade: Francis Hayman, William Hogarth, William Kent, Samuel Wale, Charles Grignion, and Simon Ravenet.<br>
<br>By the time of his retirement, Dodsley's name had appeared in imprints, either as sole or joint publisher, for 468 first editions alone. He was listed as &#145;seller&#146; in the imprints to another 135 publications. Beginning in 1753, James Dodsley's initial had become linked with Robert's in Tully's Head imprints, and, although Robert officially retired in March or April 1759, the familiar imprint R. and J. Dodsley continued to appear on Tully's Head publications until his death.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlastwillandtestament"></a>Death and last will and testament</h2>On 23 September 1764, in his sixty-first year, Dodsley died of complications arising from his old nemesis, gout, while visiting Durham with his close friend Joseph Spence. Spence, who held a prebend in that city, saw to Dodsley's burial in the Durham Cathedral churchyard and provided the inscription on the large brown stone that marks his grave.<br>
<br>Dodsley's executors were Francis Dyer, husband of his sister Alice, and his younger brother Alvory, who had served in the house of Sir George Savile (and might have been running a London pamphlet shop at the time). Over the years, Dodsley must have reinvested his profits in the business because he had comparatively little savings at the time of his death. Although he bequeathed a total of &pound;1500 to his siblings John, Isaac, Alice, and Alvory and to his nieces Kitty (daughter of Isaac), Sarah (daughter of John), and Kitty (daughter of Alice), all of these legacies were to be paid from James's &pound;2000 bond to his brother (perhaps the purchase price of Tully's Head at Robert's retirement in 1759). James was left the remaining &pound;500 due, as well as the remainder of Robert's estate. Most lucrative, however, was James's inheritance of at least fifty copyrights that, by reason of continuing editions through the rest of the century, would help make the small fortune James himself left at his death (&pound;8000 apiece to two nephews alone).<br>
