<span class="headword">Whorwood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ryder]</span>,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">royalist agent</span>, was the elder daughter of William Ryder (<i>d</i>. 1617) of Charing Cross, Westminster, a Scot and principal harbinger of the royal stables, and Elizabeth de Boussy (<i>d</i>. 1659) of Antwerp, laundress to Queen Anne. Jane was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 3 February 1612, her name being entered in the register as Janna. Early in 1619 her mother married James Maxwell (<i>d</i>. 1650) of Innerwick, groom of Prince Charles's bedchamber and gentleman usher of the black rod. The couple, who continued to live at Charing, subsequently took Guildford Park, Surrey, as their chief estate five years before Maxwell was ennobled as earl of Dirleton in 1646. Jane's younger sister Anne (1613&#150;1683) later married Sir Thomas Bowyer of Leighthorne and North Mundham, near Chichester; of their two Maxwell half-sisters, Elizabeth (1620&#150;1659) married Lord William Hamilton, soon to become secretary of state for Scotland, and Diana (1622&#150;1675) married Charles Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, the first surviving son of the second earl of Salisbury. Jane, who outlived her sisters, was excluded from their wills, and none of the ten Hamilton and Cecil nieces was named after her, despite her naming her own daughters Diana and Elizabeth in compliment within weeks of her half-sisters' respective weddings.<br>
<br>In 1634 Jane married Brome Whorwood (1615&#150;1684), heir of Sir Thomas Whorwood of Sandwell, West Bromwich, and of Holton, Oxford, through his wife Ursula, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brome. The marriage was arranged in a deal with James Maxwell for a lenient judgment on Sir Thomas in Star Chamber, where he stood indicted for ordering his bailiff to kill a man; Jane's age was misrepresented as nineteen in the marriage licence declaration, probably to conceal that she was nearly four years older than Brome Whorwood; Sir Thomas died on the wedding day. Jane brought to the marriage &pound;2600 in money, plate, and jewels from her stepfather's famed wealth. After the marriage, which probably took place at St Faith's under St Paul's, Brome Whorwood erected a brass in St Paul's Cathedral to his parents. The couple had four children, Brome (1635&#150;1657), James and Elizabeth (who both died in infancy), and Diana (1639&#150;1701). Diana married Edward Master, chancellor of the diocese of Exeter, in 1677. In 1642 Brome Whorwood evacuated his family to Holton, to join Charles I's war capital at Oxford. He then opted for neutrality, living in France until 1645. Inevitably Jane was drawn into the war effort at Oxford, back in the court that was familiar to her from her youth. She smuggled gold worth more than &pound;80,000 to the king on behalf of Sir Paul Pindar, prominent among the East India and Levant Company merchants who financed the king's war and who had been Maxwell's commercial allies in peacetime. In 1646 Lord General Thomas Fairfax took over the Whorwood home at Holton for his personal quarters and there&#151;to mark the first anniversary of the battle of Naseby in June&#151;Cromwell's daughter Bridget married the New Model Army's commissary-general, Henry Ireton. Charles I, fleeing Oxford in April, entrusted jewels to John Ashburnham, treasurer and paymaster of the king's army, who was believed to have passed them to Jane.<br>
<br>In 1647 Whorwood followed Charles to Newcastle, where her stepfather attended the diminished, captive royal court. She successfully lobbied the king, against strong competition, for the embassy at Constantinople to be given to Sir Thomas Bendish, reputedly her paramour. As Charles moved south to Holdenby House, Northamptonshire, Jane lodged near Northampton where she negotiated with Sir Robert Banastre to pay off Banastre's fine for compounding, by corrupting the chairman of the committee for the advance of money. She acted as courier for Sir Lewis Dyve, carrying letters from the Tower of London to the king; for Alderman Sir Thomas Adams, also in the Tower, conveying money from him to the king, and consulted the astrologer William Lilly on Charles's behalf. Lilly's incomplete papers show appointments with Jane ranging from May 1647 to June 1659. The king was at Hampton Court from August 1647 until November, &#145;never a prisoner, any more than a bird in a pound&#146;  (A. Fea, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Martyred King</span>, 1905, 259). Jane's stepfather was joined there by her brother-in-law, William Hamilton, earl of Lanark, who attended as a Scottish commissioner in that &#145;scottified&#146; court. Under threat from radicals in the New Model Army, Charles decided to flee on 11 November and did not wait for Lilly's response, despite sending Jane to ask his advice on the same day.<br>
<br>Charles arrived on the Isle of Wight, more by default than by design. The island's governor, Colonel Robert Hammond, placed him in protective but open custody in Carisbrooke Castle. Sir John Oglander, deputy lieutenant, who was close to the king in the early weeks, was Jane's cousin by marriage through the Bromes of Holton. After word of escape plans and a &#145;tumult&#146; at Newport, parliament placed Charles under close guard in January 1648, forbidding private access, parley, or correspondence. From London and from a base at Netley Abbey, Hampshire, home of the first marquess of Hertford, Jane organized couriers and letters, largely in cipher; she corresponded as 409 with her brother-in-law Lanark, 410, as he planned an invasion from Scotland, and she continued to consult Lilly about the king's escape plans. On 20 March 1648 Charles failed in an attempt to escape from Carisbrooke when it proved impossible for him to squeeze between bar and window frame of his chamber. Another attempt was planned and, in April, Jane arranged a boat that she and John Browne, Ashburnham's retainer, took to an anchorage on the Medway, ready to take Charles to Holland. The venture was delayed as Hammond moved the king to a more secure lodging in the castle. When finally, on 29 May, Charles was about to climb through his window, Hammond&#151;who was well aware of the escape attempt&#151;walked into the room. The governor had been warned weeks before by the committee at Derby House that a boat was waiting for the king. Whorwood was identified as being on board, &#145;a tall, well fashioned and well-languaged gentlewoman with a round visage and pockholes in her face&#146;. The antiquary Anthony Wood, who had often seen Jane in Oxford, added to this description that she was &#145;red haired&#146;. Jane and Browne were overtaken by the Kent uprising and the mutiny in the fleet, and returned to London frustrated after five weeks. &#145;Had the rest done their parts as carefully as Wharwood&#146;, lamented Hertford, &#145;The King would have been at large&#146;  (letter from H to earl of Lanark, 27 June 1648, <span class="italic">Hamilton Papers</span>, 224).<br>
<br>Moderate parliamentarians feared the army more than the king and were still prepared to settle with Charles in order to pre-empt the army radicals. This was in spite of attempted royalist uprisings in Kent and Surrey, a naval mutiny, and the Hamiltons' failed invasion in the king's name, all in the summer of 1648. Talks were proposed to be held at Newport, near Carisbrooke, beginning in September 1648. Hammond accepted the king's parole on 27 August, allowing him free access to and correspondence with his friends. In July Charles had invited Jane Whorwood to come to his chamber secretly, explicitly promising an intimate encounter. His letters reveal they met alone on the evening of 28 August and planned to do so again on 31 August. That summer they exchanged letters on an almost daily basis, Jane's cipher being variously N, 719, and 390. She sent him a &#145;long wise discourse&#146;, &#145;a memorial&#146;, &#145;hints&#146;, and &#145;arguments and advice&#146;, which have perished  (cited by Charles I, BL, Egerton MS 1788, letters 32, 50, 17). He had &#145;perfect trial of her friendship to me&#146;  (ibid., letter 17), and wrote to her sometimes twice a day, but of their correspondence only two letters to her from the king survive. Of Jane's letters to Charles's close attendant, Henry Firebrace, six (and her countersignature on a letter from John Browne) survive; one (over the pen name Hellen) to William Hopkins of Newport, and two to her brother-in-law, William Hamilton, earl of Lanark, also survive. Between April and December 1648 the king noted thirty-three other letters he had written to Jane, and eighteen she had written to him, all of which are now lost.<br>
<br>William Fiennes, Lord Saye, commissioner for parliament and a &#145;conservative Independent&#146;, believed he had more influence with the army's commanders than was in fact the case. According to Lilly, he therefore advised Charles to protract negotiations with parliament until he, Saye, could achieve a better compromise for the king with the army. Lilly claimed to have advised Jane about Saye early in September 1648, arguing that the king should concede immediately and go to London. Jane spent the autumn of the Newport talks monitoring political developments in London and Westminster. The king ignored the advice of both Lilly and Saye, prevaricating while planning an escape to France. On 13 November Jane wrote from London, where she had ridden post-haste on news of the army's intent to arrest the king. She described to Hopkins how &#145;my travels, accidents, dangers more become a Romance than a letter&#146; (13 Nov 1648, Hopkins corresp., Royal Collection, 1080413/53; published inaccurately in Wagstaffe, no. 53, p. 5). On her return to Newport about 21 November she sounded out Colonel Hammond and begged the king to escape immediately. Charles chose instead to face what &#145;God shall be pleased to suffer men to do unto me&#146;  (&#145;Farewell speech to the commissioners at Newport&#146;, Firebrace, 153). Between the king's arrest and transfer from the island in November 1648, and his execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, escapes were planned, attempted, and rumoured, but Jane's role in them remains uncertain. Her last known exchanges with the king were two letters that he received at Windsor on 26 December, and to which he replied setting down &#145;all I know&#146;. It was his last letter to her.<br>
<br>On 28 January, the Sunday between sentence and execution, Charles sent his parliamentarian attendant, Sir Thomas Herbert, with an emerald and diamond ring from his finger to retrieve jewels left in the keeping of a woman on Cannon Row. Thomas Herbert, the antiquary Sir William Dugdale, and through them Anthony Wood, believed this to be Jane Whorwood. In 1681 Herbert changed his mind, identifying the woman as Lady Wheeler, the king's laundress, who lived on Cannon Row. The Wheelers had also owned a second house next door. Herbert may have wished to deflect from the notoriety of Jane's husband, Brome Whorwood, who after twenty years as MP for Oxford (1661&#150;81) had emerged as an extreme whig, and was regarded as an enemy of the crown. Jane even apologized for him to Charles II in 1682. S. R. Gardiner and others have since questioned Herbert's accuracy and truthfulness in several matters; his health was also deteriorating by 1681, when he changed his opinion regarding this matter. An emerald and diamond ring and ring box were found in the butler's safe keeping when an inventory was made of Holton House in 1684.<br>
<br>Jane Whorwood was imprisoned briefly and fined by parliament in 1651 for bribing the committee chairman, Lord Howard of Escrick, in the Banastre case. Her wartime complicity in gold smuggling and other royalist activity was concealed by John Ashburnham and the herald Sir Edward Walker when parliament was actively seeking out offenders as late as 1651&#150;3. The MP Thomas Coke admitted under interrogation in 1651 that Jane had played a considerable role in carrying intelligence to the king &#145;as well to Oxford as to the Isle of Wight&#146;, alongside Lady Wheeler. He also confirmed Lilly's account of Lord Saye's being &#145;the most inward with the King&#146; at Newport  (<span class="italic">The Manuscripts of his Grace the Duke of Portland</span>, 10 vols., HMC, 29, 1891&#150;1931, 1.582, 593).<br>
<br>Jane returned home about 1651 to a violent husband and his mistress, Catherine Allen, a baker's daughter from St Peter-in-the-East parish, Oxford, whom he had placed in charge of Holton House. Before this Brome had spent the war years in France and the couple, although not estranged, seem to have lived separate lives between 1646 and 1651. Brome's violence and adultery drove Jane from Holton in 1653, but she agreed to return the following year when Brome promised to treat her well. Again she was forced to flee in April 1657, this time seriously injured. That September her son, Brome, drowned in the Solent <i>en route</i> for the Isle of Wight. A judicial separation and alimony were granted to her in chancery in June 1659 (the court of arches having been abolished under the Commonwealth) and a month later, her mother, the countess of Dirleton, instituted a trust fund for &#145;my ill daughter&#146;. Jane fought for her alimony at the bar of the Commons, in private with Charles II, before the lord chancellor and the court of arches, and through the bishop of Oxford, yet Brome paid only one-tenth of the award over twenty-five years. He suffered a stroke in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, and died on 12 April 1684, four days before he was due to appear before Judge Jeffreys for &#145;treasonous libel&#146;. He was buried at St Bartholomew's Church, Holton, on 24 April. Jane died in obscurity five months later, either in London or with her daughter Diana Master at Holton, and was also buried in St Bartholomew's on 20 September 1684. In November of that year her daughter took letters of administration of her estate and an inventory estimated her possessions at &pound;40. Following Diana's death in 1701 the Holton and Sandwell estates passed to Brome's illegitimate son from his relationship with Catherine Allen, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1657), conditional on his taking the surname Whorwood.<br>
