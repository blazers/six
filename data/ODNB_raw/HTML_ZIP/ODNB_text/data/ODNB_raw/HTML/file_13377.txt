<span class="headword">Hoadly,  John</span>  (1711&#150;1776), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, born in Broad Street, London, on 8 October 1711, was the youngest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13375/', "Revd Benjamin Hoadly (1676&#150;1761)")</script>, subsequently bishop of Winchester, and his first wife, Sarah Curtis (1676?&#150;1743) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13379/', "Hoadly, Sarah")</script>], a portrait painter. He attended Dr Newcome's school at Hackney where he distinguished himself by his performance as Phocyas in John Hughes's <span class="italic">Siege of Damascus</span>. Hoadly's love of the theatre proved to be lifelong. He assisted his brother, the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13374/', "Benjamin Hoadly (1706&#150;1757)")</script>, in writing <span class="italic">The Contrast, or, A Tragical Comic Rehearsal of Two Modern Plays</span>, which was brought out at Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre on 30 April 1731, and performed several times. With its ridicule of living authors such as James Thomson, the wits and the critics were both intrigued and offended in equal measure. The play, which many critics regard as a model for Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Pasquin</span> (1736), was quickly suppressed at Bishop Hoadly's request. Thought lost, a manuscript copy of the play was part of four quarto volumes discovered in 2004 and now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
<br>Hoadly matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1731 and graduated LLB in 1735. Though originally admitted at the Middle Temple on 1 November 1726, he opted to pursue a career in the church, if only because of the patronage his father, newly translated to the wealthy see of Winchester, could confer on him. He was ordained deacon on 7 December 1735 and priest on the 21st. On 26 December he was named chaplain to Frederick, prince of Wales, having been appointed as chancellor of the Winchester diocese (29 November 1735) even before taking holy orders. On 10 February 1736 Hoadly married Elizabeth, daughter of James Ashe, of Salisbury. There were no children. Over the next two years Hoadly received further ample patronage: the rectory of Mitchelmersh, Hampshire, on 8 March 1737; that of Wroughton, Wiltshire, on 8 September; that of Old Alresford, Hampshire (with the chapelries of New Alresford and Medstead), on 29 November. The same day he was collated canon of the second prebend in Winchester Cathedral. This was far from the end of his accumulations. Hoadly was rector of Wield, Hampshire, from 1737 to 1776; on 9 June 1743 he was instituted to the rectory of St Mary's, Southampton, and on 16 December 1746 to the vicarage of Overton, Hampshire. On 4 January 1748 the LLD degree was awarded to him by Thomas Herring, archbishop of Canterbury. Hoadly was appointed a chaplain in the household of Augusta, the princess dowager of Wales, on 6 May 1751. In May 1760 he was awarded the mastership of St Cross, Winchester. He was a valued assistant to his father in the latter's declining years, on whose behalf he held a visitation in the Winchester diocese in 1759.<br>
<br>Hoadly spent his summers in alternate years at his houses in Old Alresford and Southampton. He told William Hogarth jestingly that he visited Alresford occasionally as the shepherd should always be seen among his flock even if only to fleece them. A regular visitor to David Garrick at Hampton (who dubbed him the &#145;Rev'd Rigdum Funnidos&#146;), he persuaded his friends to take part in amateur theatricals at every opportunity. Hoadly wrote a variety of texts for performance, many anonymously. They included <span class="italic">Florimel, or, Love's Revenge</span> (1734), a dramatic pastoral, set to music by Maurice Greene; <span class="italic">Jephtha</span> (1737), an oratorio, music by Greene; <span class="italic">The Judgment of Hercules</span> (also known as <span class="italic">The Choice of Hercules</span>), a masque (1739?), music by Greene (lost); <span class="italic">Phoebe</span> (1748), a pastoral opera, music by Greene; <span class="italic">The Force of Truth</span> (1744), an oratorio taken from the book of <span class="roman">Esdras</span>, again with music by Greene; and <span class="italic">Love's Artifice</span> (<i>c</i>. 1750), a masque set to music by John Stanley. Hoadly composed the fifth act of James Miller's tragedy adapted from Voltaire, <span class="italic">Mahomet the Imposter</span> (1744), and completed and revised George Lillo's <span class="italic">Arden of Feversham</span> (1764). He may have assisted his brother Benjamin in the writing of <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span>. Hoadly left several dramas in manuscript, including &#145;The Housekeeper, a Farce&#146;, on the plan of James Townley's <span class="italic">High Life Below Stairs</span>; &#145;The Beggar's Garland&#146;, a one-act burlesque opera; and a tragedy on the life of Thomas Cromwell. He also dabbled in humorous versifying; some of his poems are in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection</span>, with the best a translation of Edward Holdsworth's &#145;Muscipula&#146; in volume 5 (1758). Ever protective of Bishop Hoadly's reputation, John Hoadly edited his father's works in three volumes in 1773, to which he prefixed a short life originally contributed to the supplement to the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>. He also wrote for Greene's academy at the Apollo, and composed the verses for Hogarth which were placed under the prints of <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>. A friend of the novelist Sarah Fielding, Hoadly erected a monument in her memory.<br>
<br>After many years suffering from acute gout, Hoadly died on 16 March 1776 at St Mary's rectory, Southampton, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. He had retained all his preferments except the rectory of Wroughton and the prebend of Winchester which he had resigned on 12 June 1760. A final oratorio text, <span class="italic">The Song of Moses</span>, was set to music by Thomas Linley the younger and first performed in 1777. Hoadly's talents may not have run to serious theology, but there was a charitable side to his life which became apparent to all when his will set aside money for apprenticing the poorer children of the diocese. There was also a generous bequest to the widows of clergymen lodged at Bishop Morley's Wolvesey College in Winchester. In 1793, following his wife's death, her estate was inherited by her nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/749/', "Robert Ashe")</script> [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/749/', "Ashe, Robert Hoadly-")</script>], who took the additional surname of Hoadley. John Hoadly had gifts of loyalty, good humour, friendship, and personal modesty&#151;qualities evident in his recently published correspondence with the literary critic Richard Warner&#151;which were not spoilt by his rich accumulation of church livings.<br>
