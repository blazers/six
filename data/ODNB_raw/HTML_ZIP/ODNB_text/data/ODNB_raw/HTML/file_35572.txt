<span class="headword">Pope,  George Uglow</span>  (1820&#150;1908), <span class="occ">missionary and Tamil scholar</span>, was born on 24 April 1820 in Prince Edward Island, of devout Methodist parents: his father, John Pope (1791&#150;1863), of Padstow, Cornwall, emigrated to Prince Edward Island in 1818 and then moved to Nova Scotia, where he abandoned trade to become a missionary; his mother was Catherine Uglow, of Stratton, north Cornwall. In 1826 the family returned to Plymouth, where John Pope became a prosperous merchant and shipowner, and prominent in municipal affairs. George and his younger brother, William Burt Pope, attended Wesleyan schools at Bury and Hoxton, and by fourteen George had already committed himself to missionary service in south India. In 1839, just nineteen years old, he landed in Madras, having already taught himself Tamil during the voyage. In 1841 he married Mary, daughter of J. Carver, an Anglican priest; in the same year he was ordained in the Church of England and joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG), which sent him to Tinnevelly.<br>
<br>Twenty years earlier, the SPG had taken responsibility for works in India previously supported by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), including those involving the Tamil congregations founded by Christian Friedrich Schwartz and other German missionaries in Tanjore, and in Tinnevelly further south. Pope's wife, Mary, died at Tuticorin, in 1845, and Pope remained in the region until 1849, after which he returned to Madras; in the same year he married Henrietta Page, daughter of G. Van Someren, and sailed for England. Staying for two years, mainly at Oxford, he developed relationships with leading Anglo-Catholic figures of the Oxford Movement, such as Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Trench, Bishop Wilberforce, Bishop Lonsdale, E. B. Pusey, and John Keble. After returning to India in 1851, he went back to Tanjore. There he became embroiled in acrimonious and bitter conflicts with Tamil congregations, mainly over cultural and ecclesiastical differences, legacies of German Lutheran (Halle/Royal-Danish/Tranquebar) missionaries which he could not tolerate. Finally, in 1855, when members of old Tamil congregations, led by such Vallalar luminaries as Vedanayakam Shastri (a Schwartz disciple and friend who had served as court poet to Maharaja Serfoji), had been subjected to public abuse and humiliation (including floggings), so that they broke away to form separate (Tamil-Hindu) churches free from Anglican mission control, Pope resigned in disgust.<br>
<br>Pope's legacy in Tanjore were his &#145;reforms&#146; in the old schools at St Peter's Church (which Schwartz had founded and where Vedanayakam Shastri had taught for most of his life). In Sawyerpuram (Tinnevelly district), Pope founded a new seminary for training Anglican Tamil clergy; however, the troubles between &#145;old&#146; and &#145;new&#146; Tamil clergy did not end. Eventually, in 1859, he went to the hill station of Ootacamund and founded a grammar school for European children, in which he was headmaster. &#145;Ooty&#146;, at 7000 feet in the Nilgiri hills, was the seat of the government of Madras during the hot season, and, again in 1859, Pope was also made a fellow in the newly established Madras University, for which he often served as an examiner. An honorary (or Lambeth) degree of DD was conferred upon him in 1864 by the archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Longley. In 1870 his reputation for severity with the cane caught up with him, and he moved on to become principal of Bishop Cotton's School (and college) in Bangalore. Owing to its climate, this cantonment city within the princely state of Mysore was by that time attracting a sizeable European community.<br>
<br>A decade later Pope left India for good and in 1881 settled in Oxford. Here he won recognition, appointments, and honours: as diocesan secretary of the SPG; as university lecturer in Tamil and Telugu (1884); as honorary MA (1886); as chaplain and fellow at Balliol College (1888), where he enjoyed the friendship of two masters, Benjamin Jowett and Edward Caird; and, at the age of eighty-six, a gold medal from the Royal Asiatic Society (awarded every three years to an orientalist of distinction). Pope died on 11 February 1908 at his home, 26 Walton Well Road, Oxford, and was buried at St Sepulchre's cemetery, Oxford. Friends and former students in India, including many Hindus, subscribed to a monument for his grave; founded a memorial prize in Tamil studies at the University of Madras; named a gymnasium after him in Bishop Cotton's School, Bangalore; and built a memorial hall and library at the seminary he founded in Sawyerpuram, Tinnevelly. A portrait by Alfred Wolmark, painted under a subscription gathered by his Madras pupils, was hung in the Indian Institute at Oxford.<br>
<br>Pope was one of the greatest European scholars on Tamil, along with Joseph Constantius Beschi, Francis Whyte Ellis, and Bishop Robert Caldwell. Never as interested in other Dravidian languages and literatures as in Tamil, he saw Tamil as the key to understanding south India and its cultures, histories, peoples, and religions. His first work, <span class="italic">A Catechism of Tamil Grammar</span> (1842), published just three years after his arrival in India, was reissued in 1895 by the Clarendon Press, Oxford, with an English translation and notes; and again by Oxford University Press in his series of <span class="roman">Handbooks to the ordinary dialect of the Tamil language</span> (1904&#150;6), which also included Tamil&#150;English and English&#150;Tamil dictionaries, and readings in poetry and prose. What brought him widest scholarly acclaim, however, were his critical editions of famous works in classical Tamil literature: first, in 1886, the <span class="italic">Kural</span>, a thousand-year-old metrical poem on common morality attributed to the Paraiyar poet, Tiruvalluvar; second, in 1893, the even older and no less renowned <span class="italic">Naladiyar</span>, consisting of four hundred quatrains of morally edifying aphorisms; and, third, in 1900, the <span class="italic">Tiruvaragam</span>, a collection of the sacred utterances of Manikka-Varagar, to which Pope prefixed a summary of the life and legends of the author and added appendices on <span class="italic">Saiva Siddhantha</span> philosophy and praxis. This last work, celebrating Pope's eightieth birthday, was dedicated to the memory of Jowett.<br>
<br>Each of Pope's works was accompanied by an English translation, a Tamil lexicon, and a copious commentary. Apart from their obvious erudition, they reflected Pope's respect for Tamil culture, language, and literature. Pope also left manuscript editions and translations of other Tamil works, together with a vast amount of material which he had been collecting for the production of a standard Tamil dictionary, something he hoped that Tamil scholars in Madras would complete after his death. He had, moreover, begun work about 1890 on a catalogue of the Tamil printed books in the British Museum (later completed by L. D. Barnett). Numerous pamphlets and sermons, published during his early days in India, included <span class="italic">An Alphabet for All India</span> (Madras, 1859), a visionary plan for putting all the languages of India into a romanized alphabet.<br>
<br>An ardent student of all fine literature, Pope was especially fond of Robert Browning, to whose achievements he paid tribute in his <span class="italic">St John in the Desert</span> (1897; 2nd edn, 1904, with introduction and notes on Browning's &#145;A Death in the Desert&#146;). He knew Browning personally, and gave the poet a &#145;square old yellow book with crumpled vellum covers&#146;, which was to form the basis of Browning's major poem, <span class="italic">The Ring and the Book</span>, which Pope presented to the library of Balliol College. Keenly interested in philosophy and religion, he welcomed developments of modern (higher-critical) Christian thought, moving ever further from the Wesleyanism in which he had been brought up. Known for his lively and colourful conversation, his preoccupations reflected a wide variety of intellectual interests and an increasing catholicity of outlook.<br>
<br>After Pope's death his second wife, Henrietta, and two daughters received a civil pension of &pound;50, in 1909; after her death at Forest Hill, London, on 11 September 1911, she was buried alongside her husband. Three sons won distinction in government service: John Van Someren Pope was director of public instruction in Burma for seventeen years; Arthur William Uglow Pope CIE was a railway engineer and manager in India and China; and Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Henry Pope IMS was a professor of ophthalmology at Madras Medical College.<br>
