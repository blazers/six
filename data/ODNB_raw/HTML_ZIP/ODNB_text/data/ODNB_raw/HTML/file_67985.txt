<span class="headword">Marshall,  John</span>  (1642&#150;1677), <span class="occ">Indian scholar</span>, was the third son of Ralph Marshall and of his wife, Abigail, daughter of Robert Rogers of Netherthorpe, Yorkshire. He was baptized at East Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire, on 1 March 1642, and was educated at Louth, also in Lincolnshire, at the school of a Mr Skelton. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in December 1660, taking his BA in 1664. Although a person of scholarly inclination, he left Cambridge in January 1668, being unable to hold a fellowship at Christ's because the college could not appoint two fellows from the same county and already had one from Essex, where Marshall's family now lived. Having &#145;a great desire to travell&#146;, he applied to enter the service of the East India Company  (<span class="italic">John Marshall in India</span>, 39). Through the influence of his elder brother he was appointed a factor in the company's service on the Coromandel coast of south-eastern India, where he arrived in September 1668 after a nine-month voyage on one of the company's ships. The following year he moved up the coast to Balasore in Orissa, one of the company's trading posts in what was then called The Bay, that is the region round the Bay of Bengal. He was to live out the rest of his life in the company's Bay settlements, serving mainly at Balasore, at Patna in Bihar, and at Hooghly and the silk-producing centre of Cossimbazar in lower Bengal.<br>
<br>In all his postings Marshall seems generally to have earned the respect of his colleagues for the manner in which he managed the company's commercial business in obtaining cotton cloth, silk, and saltpetre to be shipped to England or dealt on its behalf with local officials, although his &#145;naturall modesty, calme disposition, and soft (though quick) utterance of speech&#146;  (Foster, 306) meant that he was thought to lack the necessary &#145;audacity&#146;  (ibid.) to hold his own in a major Indian court. He was clearly a fine linguist, proficient in Persian, Arabic, and &#145;Hindostand&#146; (presumably Hindi or Urdu). He was at least aware of Sanskrit and able to give a specimen of its script, which he &#145;writ from the Bramin Doctor in Pattana&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Marshall in India</span>, 423).<br>
<br>Marshall was not only a conscientious servant of the company, but he was also intensely interested in the surroundings in which he lived, and his linguistic abilities were such that he was able to communicate easily with Indians in order to elicit information from them and obtain texts. The legacy of his interests is a deposit of manuscripts, consisting of translations and of &#145;notes and observations&#146;, apparently intended for his old friends at Cambridge. Nothing of Marshall's, apart from an essay in the form of a letter later published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, appeared in print before the twentieth century, and thus what was the most significant body of material about India to be brought to Britain before James Fraser's collection was acquired by Oxford in the mid-eighteenth century remained largely unknown to contemporaries.<br>
<br>Marshall was especially interested in religion. Whereas knowledge of other religions shook the faith of some of his contemporaries, Marshall wrote that he had always had &#145;a profound Veneration for the Dictates of Nature, and the universal Traditions of Nations, for thereby are infinite things to be learned for the establishing of our Glorious Religion against Atheists, and the more easie propagation of the same amongst Infidels and Heathens&#146;  (&#145;Letter from the East Indies&#146;, 729). He records a number of discussions with Muslims, but his main efforts were to elucidate Hinduism. Here his principal informant seems to have been a Brahman at Cossimbazar called &#145;Muddoosoodun Raure&#146; (Madhusudhana Radha), who gave him a Persian version of the <span class="italic">Bhagavad purana</span>, one of the most revered texts of Vaishnavite Hinduism, which Marshall translated in six instalments between 1674 and 1677. Madhusudhana also gave him a version of the <span class="roman">Sama Veda</span> or &#145;Epicomie of the sum of the four Beads [Vedas] or the most materiall things in them&#146; to translate. Also surviving is Marshall's English version of &#145;A familiar and free Dialogue&#146; with Madhusudhana about Hindu beliefs and such questions as &#145;How shall I know that before the world was, God was?&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 4253, fol. 3). Marshall concluded from his inquiries that Hindus were monotheists who acknowledge &#145;the being of a mighty God&#146; and did not deserve condemnation as &#145;Barbarians, Heathens and Idolaters&#146;  (&#145;Letter from the East Indies&#146;, 729&#150;32).<br>
<br>Marshall's two manuscript books of &#145;notes and observations&#146; are extremely diverse. They include more about religious beliefs and much else besides, such as natural history, topography, customs, astrology, and medical practices. He set down without comment &#145;a great many Secrets in Physick&#146; and &#145;many Traditions and Stories&#146; that he had learned from his informants. He was, however, unimpressed by Indian &#145;Learning and Knowledge&#146;, which he dismissed as &#145;but little&#146; and full of &#145;Absurdities and Cabalistick Complications of Figures&#146;  (&#145;Letter from the East Indies&#146;, 737). Marshall died at Balasore, where he was in charge of the company's affairs, on 31 August 1677 after a short illness. Evidently he never married and had no children.<br>
