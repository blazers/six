<span class="headword">Evans,  George Ewart</span>  (1909&#150;1988), <span class="occ">historian and writer</span>, was born on 1 April 1909 in Abercynon, Glamorgan, one of the eleven children, seven boys and four girls, of William Evans, shopkeeper, of Abercynon. He was one of the eight children of his father's second marriage, to Janet Hitchings of Maesteg. He was educated at Mountain Ash grammar school, and then University College, Cardiff, where he went as a trainee teacher on a Glamorgan county council scholarship, winning a college bursary <i>en route</i>. He read classics and graduated in the summer of 1930 with a lower second-class degree. There followed a year of professional training, at the end of which he obtained his diploma in education and became unemployed. As he himself bitterly remarked in his autobiography: &#145;You swore to teach but the Board of Education &hellip; could not provide you with the opportunity.&#146;<br>
<br>When Evans finally found work in 1934 it was quite another aspect of his career which gave him the necessary qualifications. From his late boyhood Evans had been a fine rugby player and an excellent runner. He had played rugby both for the renowned Mountain Ash &#145;Old Firm&#146; before university, and for University College as an undergraduate. His running was in the rougher school of the old Welsh working-class semi-professional track, where, by side bets, he gained the money to finance part of his university career. It was this athleticism which got him his first job in 1934, as a games master at the newly opened Sawston Village College, Cambridgeshire, where he met Florence Knappett, who was later to become his wife.<br>
<br>Evans's move to East Anglia, although it happened by chance, was to prove momentous in what was to be his final career&#151;that of writer and historian of rural life. By 1934 he had already decided, as he later wrote, that &#145;I did not care ultimately what kind of job I took. I determined that my real work henceforth would be to write.&#146; In the following years he published a number of short stories, poems, and articles and became closely associated with the group around Keidrych Rhys's magazine <span class="italic">Wales</span>, and the London-based <span class="italic">Left Review</span>. These pieces are, in some ways, very much of their time, and yet they also show a close sense of the realities of life in south Wales which distinguish them from the run-of-the-mill socialist-realist fiction of the period.<br>
<br>In October 1941 Evans was called up into the Royal Air Force. Restricted because of his increasing deafness to home-based and ground-based duties, he served as a radio technician in 206 squadron, Coastal Command. After his wartime service Evans published a full-length novel, <span class="italic">The Voices of the Children</span> (1947), but it was badly received outside Wales. In the 1940s he suffered recurrent moods of black depression, in which he constantly questioned his own abilities, and felt a despair which was exacerbated by his deafness, which made it virtually impossible to find work as a teacher.<br>
<br>In 1948 Evans moved to Blaxhall in Suffolk, where his wife had been appointed village schoolteacher, and it was out of Blaxhall that his first book about English rural life, <span class="italic">Ask the Fellows who Cut the Hay</span>, came in 1956. The book was based on interviews with the older inhabitants of the village about their lives, their work, and their communities. This was a technique used in folk-life studies, and one which was beginning to find favour in the world of radio, but it was still well outside the bounds of conventional academic history. The book, however, was a success and in the next ten years three more followed. Part of their popularity certainly rested on the English nostalgia for a lost rural past, but, like Evans's earlier fiction, they contained a great deal more than that. Evans also lectured widely, particularly for the Workers' Educational Association. In the late 1960s, with the emergence of the technique of oral history in British academic life, there followed a period of stimulating, if not always easy, contact with academic life, especially the University of Essex, where Evans was Major Burrows lecturer in 1972 and a visiting fellow from 1973 to 1978. His books from this period, particularly <span class="italic">Where Beards Wag All</span> (1970), <span class="italic">The Days that we have Seen</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">From Mouths of Men</span> (1976), represent his best work. Careful and beautifully crafted, they remind the reader that Evans remained a writer as much as a historian. In the 1980s his relationship with academe, never easy, became more tense. His book on the myth of the hare, <span class="italic">The Leaping Hare</span>, written in 1972 with David Thomson, had been dismissed by academic anthropology, and he felt that oral history was moving away from its roots into ever wilder areas of theory, while neglecting the ordinary people. Some of these feelings are present in his fine volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">The Strength of the Hills</span> (1983), and in his last book, the much less satisfactory <span class="italic">Spoken History</span> (1987).<br>
<br>Through all this Evans retained much of his Welshness. Although not tall, he was an upright figure who kept his rugby-playing physique until late in life. He was a native Welsh speaker, and retained a clear Welsh accent all his life, which was often a shock to those who knew him only through his books and assumed he was East Anglian. His past also shaped him in other, more fundamental, ways. Politically he was born into a radical family; he was named Ewart after William Ewart Gladstone, and that radicalism never left him. He was a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s and remained very close to communism throughout his life. His politics and his Welshness drew him back in the 1970s to the subject matter of Wales, and in his last books he became a chronicler of the end of the south Wales coal industry, as he had earlier been the recorder of the end of horse-based agriculture in England.<br>
<br>Evans remained very much an outsider to the academic world. His honesty, which was often blunt, and always based on a deep distrust of the English ruling &eacute;lite, ill fitted him for English universities, and it is perhaps not surprising that it was at the politically radical University of Essex of the 1970s that he seemed happiest. He was awarded an honorary DU by Essex in 1982, and an honorary DLitt by the University of Keele in 1983. In 1971 he was president of the anthropology section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Swansea.<br>
<br>In 1938 Evans married Florence Ellen, daughter of Albert George Knappett, clerk in the stock exchange. They had a son, who became a director of Faber and Faber, Evans's publishers, and three daughters, one of whom married David Gentleman, who illustrated many of Evans's books. Florence was a key figure in Evans's life, supporting him with her teaching in the 1940s and early 1950s, when otherwise he would not have been able to write, as well as being a gentle but firm commentator on his work, of which she said once, &#145;[it was] a bit creepy &hellip; listening to all those dead voices&#146;. Evans died on 11 January 1988 at Brooke, Norfolk, where he had lived since the 1970s.<br>
