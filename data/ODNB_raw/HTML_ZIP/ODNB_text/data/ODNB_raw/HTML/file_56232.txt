<span class="headword">Garnett,  (Frances) Theresa</span>  (1888&#150;1966), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born on 17 May 1888 at 33 Stanningley Road, Armley, Leeds, the daughter of Joshua Garnett (<i>b</i>. 1862), an iron planer, and his wife, Frances Theresa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Armstead. Theresa Garnett was educated at a convent school and was for some time a teacher.<br>
<br>In 1907 Theresa Garnett joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the organization formed in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst to lobby for women's enfranchisement. She claimed to have inherited her fighting spirit from Irish ancestors  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 2 July 1909, 877). In April 1909, with four others, including Alys Russell (first wife of Bertrand Russell), Theresa Garnett chained herself to a statue in the central lobby of the houses of parliament to protest against the so-called <span class="roman">Brawling Bill</span>, which was intended to penalize anyone found guilty of disorderly conduct within the confines of the Palace of Westminster while parliament was in session. She suffered no punishment on this occasion but on 29 June, by now a seasoned protester, after having taken part in a WSPU deputation from Caxton Hall to the houses of parliament she was arrested in Whitehall while participating in the ensuing stone-throwing at government offices. She was sentenced to a month's imprisonment in Holloway, where she went on hunger strike and was, in addition, charged with biting and kicking a wardress. Her defence was that she had not bitten but that the wardress might have been scratched by her WSPU brooch. She was found guilty of assault, sentenced to a further term of imprisonment, again went on hunger strike, and was released within a few days. In August 1909, as Annie O'Sullivan, Theresa Garnett was sentenced after taking part in a demonstration in Liverpool on the roof of the Sun Hall, in which building R. B. Haldane, the Liberal minister, was holding a meeting. She was imprisoned in Walton gaol, went on hunger strike, and was released on 26 August.<br>
<br>In Bristol in November 1909, wearing a &#145;merry widow&#146; hat and with a whip in her hand, Theresa Garnett accosted Winston Churchill. The account in the WSPU newspaper, <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, on 19 November 1909, mentions that she struck him several times but in an interview, recorded in 1964, Theresa Garnett was adamant that she had not touched him. She was, in the end, charged with disturbing the peace, sentenced to a month's imprisonment in Horfield gaol, and went on hunger strike. As a protest against being forcibly fed she set fire to her cell, and was then placed in a punishment cell, in solitary confinement, for eleven of the fifteen remaining days of her sentence. After being found unconscious, she spent the rest of her sentence in a hospital ward. By the end of 1910, however, suffragette militancy had increased to a level that she could no longer support; she left the WSPU and did not join any other suffrage group, although she kept in touch with her erstwhile comrades. Theresa Garnett was a sister at the London Hospital and nursed at the front during the First World War. She was an active member of the Suffragette Fellowship after the Second World War and in 1960 was honorary editor of the Women's Freedom League <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>. In 1962 Theresa Garnett gave to the National Portrait Gallery a wooden head of Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, which had been sculpted by Albert Moroder in 1949. She died on 24 May 1966, virtually penniless, in Whittington Hospital, near her home in north London. She was unmarried.<br>
