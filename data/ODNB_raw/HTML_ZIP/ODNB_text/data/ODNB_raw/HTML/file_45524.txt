<span class="headword">Bevan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bennett]</span>,  Hannah Marishall</span>  (1798&#150;1874), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 1 February 1798 in London, one of three children and the only daughter of William Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1818), tea merchant, and his wife, Hannah Fossick. She was brought up as a member of the Society of Friends. After her mother had suffered a stroke, leaving her partly paralysed, Hannah Bennett was sent to a school in Croydon at the age of twelve. Even as a child her unselfishness, humility, and strong powers of sympathy were very marked. On leaving school she nursed her mother until her death. The death of her father shortly afterwards, in 1818, left her with only her two brothers, William (1804&#150;1843) and Samuel, for companions. Hannah kept house for both of them and, with Samuel, carried on her father's tea business. After his death from consumption she continued to live with William.<br>
<br>In April 1824 Hannah Bennett joined the British Ladies Society for promoting the reform of female prisoners, founded by Elizabeth Fry in 1821. In May she was appointed to visit the convict ships with Elizabeth Pryor, and she also campaigned for the better treatment of the female convicts during transportation. On 15 August 1827 she married Thomas Bevan (1804&#150;1847), a surgeon in Liverpool Street, London.<br>
<br>In 1828&#151;the same year in which her first child was born&#151;Hannah Bevan was acknowledged as a minister of the Society of Friends. Her son died at thirteen months old, but she gave birth to five more sons and two daughters between 1829 and 1842. Occupied by her family and entertaining her large circle of friends, Hannah Bevan continued her philanthropic work, establishing, with the assistance of some friends, the Foster Street ragged school. Still a member of the British Ladies Society (although she stopped visiting the ships after her marriage), she sat on the society's subcommittee to discuss the future management of convict ships in 1831. Her resignation is not noted; she seems simply to have stopped attending the meetings.<br>
<br>In her later years Hannah Bevan took an active interest in the total abstinence cause: the first Band of Hope in London was formed at her house by her friend Thomas B. Smithies and consisted of some of her own children with a few neighbours. During the potato famine of Ireland in 1846 she worked energetically with others for the relief of those who were starving. She also assisted in the establishment of the First Day School in Quaker Street, Spitalfields (later merged with the Bedford Institute), and was a teacher there. With John Pryor and her brother William Bennett she aided the establishment of the Friends' Institute, which had its headquarters at White Hart Court. She was also deeply interested in the care of young men separated from their homes.<br>
<br>In 1847 Thomas Bevan became ill and died at the age of forty-three; Hannah's two youngest sons also became severely ill and died that year. In 1852 she moved to Darlington, where two of her surviving sons lived. She visited the inmates of the local workhouse and would invite the children to tea as a treat. However, 1859 saw the start of a long illness, and in June 1864 Hannah Bevan suffered a stroke, from which she never fully recovered. She soon afterwards moved back to London, where she lingered on for ten more years. She died on 7 November 1874 at Linden House, Laurel Grove, Penge, near Sydenham, and was buried at Winchmore Hill with her late husband and children.<br>
<br>Hannah Bevan's philanthropic concern for the disadvantaged of early nineteenth-century society was not unusual among Quaker women, and she was but one of many who gained their first experience of philanthropic work in Elizabeth Fry's British Ladies Society; the range of her subsequent involvements, however, is perhaps more remarkable.<br>
