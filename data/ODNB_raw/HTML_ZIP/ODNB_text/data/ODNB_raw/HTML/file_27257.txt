<span class="headword">Thompson, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1799), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62531/', "Norborne Berkeley, later fourth Baron de Botetourt (1717&#150;1770)")</script>, of Stoke Gifford, Gloucestershire, governor of Virginia; his mother was a Mrs Thompson of Edinburgh, with whom Berkeley had another son. He first went to sea in a merchant ship but in 1755, shortly before the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, he entered the navy on the <i>Nassau</i>. Between 1755 and December 1760 he served successively in the <i>Nassau</i>, in the <i>Prince Frederick</i>, and with Captain Samuel Barrington in the <i>Achilles</i>. On 16 January 1761, having passed his lieutenant's examination, he was commissioned fifth lieutenant of the <i>Arrogant</i>, in which he served first in the channel and then in the Mediterranean. The <i>Arrogant</i> was paid off at the peace, and in August 1763 Thompson joined the sloop <i>Cygnet</i>, in which he served on the North American station until July 1768 when the <i>Cygnet</i> was sold out of the navy in South Carolina; Thompson, with the other officers, was left to find his own passage to England, for which he was later paid &pound;39 0<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>In May 1770 Thompson was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Salisbury</i>, again on the North American station, and in February 1771 he was promoted by Commodore James Gambier to command the sloop <i>Senegal</i>. Three months later he was appointed acting captain of the <i>Mermaid</i>, which he took to England in December 1771. The Admiralty refused to confirm this last commission, but promoted him to captain's rank on 7 March 1772, and appointed him to the <i>Chatham</i>, going out to the West Indies with the flag of Vice-Admiral William Parry. From the <i>Chatham</i> he was moved into the frigate <i>Crescent</i>, before returning to England in 1774. He was appointed to the frigate <i>Boreas</i> in 1775, and early in 1776 was sent to Jamaica, where he captured the French ship <i>Le Compas</i> (20 guns). He returned to England with a convoy of merchant ships in October 1777, and was again sent out to the West Indies. There in 1780 he began a long-running feud with Sir John Laforey following Laforey's appointment as commissioner of Antigua yard. Thompson's refusal to recognize this authority led to animosity; this flared up again fifteen years later when Laforey was commander-in-chief at the Leeward Islands. The later confrontation provided Lord Spencer with a reason for sending Laforey home, an act which created alarm in the Admiralty and led to the resignation of Sir Charles Middleton.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1780 Thompson was moved by Sir George Rodney into the <i>Alcide</i> (74 guns). He commanded the <i>Alcide</i> in the action off the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781, with Sir Samuel Hood at St Kitts in January 1782, and in the battle of the Saints on 12 April 1782. At the end of the American War of Independence he brought the <i>Alcide</i> to England, and later in 1783 he married Jane Selby, daughter and heir of Robert Selby of Bonington, near Edinburgh. They subsequently raised five children. In 1787 he commanded the <i>Edgar</i> at Portsmouth, and during the crisis of the Spanish armament in 1790 he was given command of the <i>Elephant</i>.<br>
<br>In 1793 on the outbreak of the war with revolutionary France, Thompson was appointed to the <i>Vengeance</i> and was attached to the expedition against French possessions in the West Indies led by Sir John Jervis and Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Grey. There, in 1794, as commodore, he took part in the capture of Martinique where he directed the boat attacks against Fort Royal, and Guadeloupe. On 12 April 1794 he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue; he returned to England in 1795 with his flag in the <i>Vanguard</i>, and on 1 June he was promoted vice-admiral.<br>
<br>In 1796 Thompson was elected MP for Monmouth and, with his flag in the <i>London</i>, he was given command of a detached squadron blockading the French coast off Brest. Towards the close of the year he was sent out to the Mediterranean in the <i>Britannia</i>, and was second in command at the battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797. Thompson's disregard of Jervis's signal to tack to counter a Spanish move to threaten the British nearly lost the battle. Jervis was angered by the failure to act but chose not to make it a public issue. Later in 1797 Thompson was made a baronet for his contribution to the battle. He continued with the fleet for some months, but again came into conflict with Jervis (now Lord St Vincent) when the latter insisted on hanging four mutineers on the Sabbath (Sunday 9 July 1797). St Vincent used the affair as a suitable pretext to write to the Admiralty insisting on Thompson's removal.<br>
<br>Thompson was accordingly recalled, and was appointed to a command in the fleet off Brest. He held this during 1798, but his health had for some time been failing, and early in the following year he was obliged to strike his flag and go on shore. He died at Fareham on 17 March 1799. On 16 April St Vincent wrote of Thompson as a &#145;gallant man, but the most timid officer&#146;, and drew attention to his having &#145;the manner of a rough seaman&#146; which Thompson cultivated by his habit of dressing casually in a sailor's frock and straw hat  (Brenton, 2.7).<br>
