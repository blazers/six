<span class="headword">Ferrers,  Robert  de</span>, first Earl Ferrers <span class="st"> [earl of Derby, earl of Nottingham]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1139), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9361/', "Henry de Ferrers (d. 1093x1100)")</script>, landowner, and his wife, Bertha, who succeeded to their English lands, notably the compact but undeveloped lordship of Tutbury, Staffordshire, around 1100. He is first mentioned, after his brothers, Engenulph and William, and before unnamed sisters, in the foundation charter for Tutbury Priory issued by his father between 1087 and 1100. William joined Robert Curthose and was captured at Tinchebrai; Engenulph is last heard of in 1100, but Robert de Ferrers supported Henry I from an early stage. He played a part in local administration in Derbyshire and elsewhere, chiefly in the midlands, throughout his reign. He also intermittently witnessed the king's charters, being with him at Westminster in 1107, Nottingham in 1122, Winchester in 1123, and in council at Northampton on 8 September 1131, but there is no record of his accompanying Henry I abroad. In 1129/30 he held the farm of Wirksworth soke, Derbyshire, an area rich in lead mines, for &pound;80; around this date he also granted the church of Potterspury, Northamptonshire, to Bernard the Scribe. It is, however, during his last years that he is most in evidence as a leading supporter of King Stephen.<br>
<br>As baron, Robert de Ferrers was with Stephen, at Reading about 4 January 1136, at York in February, Westminster at Easter (7 April), and Oxford later that month, witnessing many important royal charters, including a celebrated declaration of the liberties of the church. When civil war broke out Ferrers may have been at the siege of Shrewsbury in early August 1138, but his most notable military service was with William, count of Aumale, William Peverel, Geoffrey Aiselin, Walter Espec, and Gilbert de Lacy in the defeat of David, king of Scotland, and his Scandinavian and rebel allies, at the bitterly contested battle of the Standard, fought near Northallerton on 22 August 1138. In gratitude Stephen named Ferrers earl. Charters and chronicles from this point refer to him interchangeably as Earl Ferrers, earl of Nottingham or earl of Derby. But he died in the following year and was succeeded in his earldom by his son, also Robert (<i>d</i>. 1159), who continued to play a minor and largely temporizing role in the civil war, only finally throwing in his lot with the future Henry II after Tutbury Castle was besieged in 1153.<br>
<br>Some authorities claim that Robert de Ferrers married Hawise, or Havisa, daughter of the Breton lord Andr&eacute; de Vitr&eacute;, but no convincing proof has been adduced; Walkelin Maminot (<i>d</i>. 1170) was a son-in-law, won over to Stephen's cause by Ferrers in 1138; another daughter married Ralph Paynel, lord of Dudley, Worcestershire. Relations were also traditionally close with the Peverel family, hereditary castellans of Nottingham, and the younger Robert de Ferrers married the eventual heir, Maud Peverel, between about 1120 and 1135. The elder Robert de Ferrers remained a generous benefactor of Tutbury Priory, but other surviving charters show that he made gifts to Nostell Priory and settled his disputes with Burton Abbey.<br>
