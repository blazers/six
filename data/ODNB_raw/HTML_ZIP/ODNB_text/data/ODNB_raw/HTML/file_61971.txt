<span class="headword">Holme,  Thomas</span>  (1626/7&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, was born at Kendal in Westmorland to parents at present unknown, and was by trade a weaver. In 1652 he was convinced by William Gibson and later became &#145;the apostle of Quakerism in South Wales&#146;  (Braithwaite, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 92). In 1653 he began his first missionary tour of Cumberland, Westmorland, co. Durham, Lancashire, Staffordshire, and Cheshire where, although he experienced success in gaining converts, he occasionally met violent opposition. In October 1653, while preaching at a conventicle at Durham, he was &#145;violently pulled downe &hellip; from the seat on wch he stood&#146;  (Penney, 89), but was rescued by other Friends at the meeting. Similarly on 28 August 1655 while in prison at Chester, Holme wrote to Margaret Fell noting that prior to his arrest he had &#145;suffered sum percution &hellip; stones &amp; durt cast upon mee&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., Swarthmore MSS, 1.197). In a letter of 10 December 1655 Holme observed that William Bell, vicar of Huyton near Liverpool, had threatened to confront the Quakers and &#145;have our blood&#146;  (ibid., 1.194).<br>
<br>In earlier letters written from Chester between March and October 1654 to George Fox, Thomas Willan, and Margaret Fell, Holme noted that he was in prison along with other Friends, notably <a name="cosubject_69086"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Leavens</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1665) who was to become his wife and fellow <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>. In March 1654 he noted that before he was arrested the officer sent to apprehend him fainted, which was taken by Friends as a sign that Holme had received God's favour. To assist his missionary work in northern England and on the Welsh borders the Society supplied him with a pair of shoes and breeches worth 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. from a fund for travelling Quaker preachers, while Thomas Storey, another early Quaker, bequeathed &pound;5. During his confinement at Chester Holme was often moved by the Lord to sing loudly at any hour of the day or night; as he wrote to Margaret Fell on 5 April 1654:<blockquote>And the power was so great it made all my fellow-prisoners amazed, and some were shaken, for the power was exceeding great, and I scarcely know whether I was in the body, yea or no, and there appeared light in the prison and astonished me, and I was afraid, and trembled at the appearance of the light, my legs shook under me: and my fellow-prisoners beheld the light and wondered, and the light was so glorious it dazzled my eyes. (Braithwaite, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 125)</blockquote>Apart from his preaching and singing, in August 1655 Holme walked the streets of Chester &#145;naked as a sign&#146; which led to a further period of imprisonment in the city gaol. It seems that his preaching was successful and occasioned &#145;a remarkable revival in Cheshire and South Lancashire, where his excitable nature had awakened a condition in his hearers&#146;  (Brailsford, 149).<br>
<br>It was, however, in Wales that Holme made his greatest impact. He held open-air meetings or &#145;threshing meetings&#146; in Wales and frequently harangued clergymen. As a consequence he was constantly imprisoned and received &#145;many hardships, as scoffing, scorneing, beatinge, and Imprisonmt&#146;  (Penney, 257). On 16 October 1654 he married Elizabeth Leavens, after they had seen visions that this was the will of God. Their marriage and Elizabeth's subsequent pregnancy in 1656 caused Margaret Fell to rebuke the couple as she felt that they were undermining their missionary work and burdening recently &#145;convinced&#146; members in south Wales. Yet both continued to preach after their marriage and ensured that they conducted separate preaching tours. They had three children who remained with fellow Friends, but who after the death of Thomas and Elizabeth &#145;walked not in the steps of theire honrable parents&#146;  (ibid., 260).<br>
<br>The preaching of Holmes and his wife quickly converted many Welsh people to Quakerism. In 1655 Thomas Willan of Kendal wrote to Margaret Fell about the success of their missionary work, and on 27 February 1656 Holme himself wrote to Fox that his arrival in Radnor had led to the conversion of many Welsh Baptists and consequently &#145;many of the Churches ar[e] broken in pecses&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., Swarthmore MSS, 4.247). He had, he continued, held two further meetings in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire, the first at an inn and the second, the following day, in the market place where he &#145;drew the peopell into A convenient place &amp; spok A prety time to them&#146;  (ibid.). Such meetings, he felt, &#145;cast A sund thoraw the town &amp; country for not any frind had spoken ther before &hellip;&#146; and &#145;&hellip; the Lord is gathering A peopell in Munmuthshir &amp; Glamorganshir&#146;  (ibid.). Similarly he informed Margaret Fell the following April that in Monmouthshire and Glamorgan Friends were able to hold at least ten meetings on a regular basis and &#145;in many places hear is breakings thorow A peopell the lord &hellip; is gathering&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., Swarthmore MSS, 1.203).<br>
<br>With the assistance of Holme's wife, Elizabeth, and Alice Birkett, another itinerant preacher, further meetings were held throughout south Wales, and among the first attenders were two justices of the peace, one at Newport and Walter Jenkins of Llanfihangel Ystum Llywern. More conversions soon followed. As the meetings increased in size Holme was able to organize small communities of worshippers to meet in family homes or at other suitable venues.<br>
<br>In 1657 Holme complained about Welsh Friends who had accompanied James Nayler to Bristol. He criticized the constant interruptions of Nayler's devotees to the Welsh meetings and noted their &#145;tumbling on floors&#146; and their preference for sackcloth and ashes  (RS Friends, Lond., Swarthmore MSS, 1.196). In response George Fox visited Wales and, with the assistance of Holme, helped to convince many of &#145;Truth&#146; and established new meetings. On 16 April 1657 Holme expressed his fervent piety in a letter to Margaret Fell:<blockquote>I know that hee that hath delivered me will alsoe deliver mee, from every evell worke, hee hath not left my soull in hell, but hath redemed it by his precious blood, of which I daily drinke, wher by I am dayly refreshed. (ibid.)</blockquote>The following year Holme was imprisoned at Usk, Monmouthshire, for disturbing a minister during divine service at Caer-went, and continued to preach against &#145;hireling&#146; ministers throughout the remaining years of the interregnum. Outdoor meetings continued to be held: in March 1660 Holme recorded both that at several meetings in south Wales &#145;many was convinced of the truth &hellip; and unclean spirits are cept down &hellip; the power of god is on top of that which would have been on top of it&#146; and the continuing animosity that such meetings generated; soldiers had violently broken up a meeting in Monmouthshire and &#145;threatened to pistol one or two of us&#146;, later imprisoning nineteen Friends at Usk gaol  (RS Friends, Lond., Swarthmore MSS, 4.253, 252). He was again imprisoned at Cardiff in 1661. The persecution of Friends had not abated by 1663 when Holme wrote to Fox on 11 June noting the various meetings that had been established in Wales as well as the occasional violence encountered by Friends.<br>
<br>Holme, along with other missionary Friends from the north of England, was &#145;instrumentall to the Convincemt of many, and to strengthen in the Truth those that were convinc't before&#146;  (Penney, 323). On 10 September 1665 Elizabeth Holme died at Kendal and on 2 October 1666 Thomas died, at St Fagans, near Cardiff, aged thirty-nine. On 4 October he was interred at the Pont-y-Moel burial-ground in Pontypool. According to Friends his death was &#145;greatly Lameneted &hellip; his service amongst them haveing bene so great that he was highly Esteemed &amp; beloved by them above most&#146;  (ibid., 257).<br>
