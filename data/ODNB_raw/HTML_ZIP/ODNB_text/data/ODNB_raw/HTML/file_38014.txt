<span class="headword">Stone,  Edward</span>  (1702&#150;1768), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and discoverer of the active ingredient in aspirin</span>, was born in Lacey Green, Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, on 5 November 1702, the only son of Edward Stone (<i>d</i>. 1740&times;42), yeoman, and his first wife, Elizabeth Reynolds (<i>d</i>. before 1707). On 23 April 1707 his father married as his second wife Elizabeth Grubb (<i>d</i>. 1751), daughter of John Grubb (1625&#150;1700) of Horsenden and Owlswick, both in Buckinghamshire; they had a daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1709). In 1716 Stone's father bought his wife's two sisters out of their shares of the manor of Owlswick, and was thereafter styled gentleman. Stone remained in close contact with the Grubb family, and acted on his stepmother's behalf in money matters until her death.<br>
<br>Stone matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1720 and graduated BA (1724) and MA (1727). He was ordained deacon on 17 March 1728 by the bishop of Lincoln, becoming assistant curate of Saunderton, Buckinghamshire; four months later, on 16 June 1728, he was ordained priest in order that he could take up the curacy of Charlton-on-Otmoor, Oxfordshire. He remained there until 1730 when he was elected a fellow of Wadham. Stone preached the university sermon on 10 December 1732, which was later printed. This led to an exchange of polemical pamphlets. Although undoubtedly worsted by Thomas Chubb, Stone retained his dignity and courtesy.<br>
<br>In 1738 John Grubb (1674&#150;1760), his stepmother's brother, presented Stone as rector of Horsenden, Buckinghamshire. He never resided in the tiny parish, and seems only to have visited it occasionally. In the scandal that arose in Wadham in 1739 concerning the predatory homosexual activities of the warden, Robert Thistlethwayte, Stone was consulted by an aggrieved undergraduate and his friends, even though he was not resident at the time, and suggested that they seek legal advice. In 1741 he resigned his fellowship to marry Grubb's daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1751), on 7 July at Mercers' Hall chapel, Cheapside, London. They had one son, Edward (1744&#150;1811), who also entered the ordained ministry, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who died in infancy. Sir Jonathan Cope presented him as rector of St Peter's, Drayton, near Banbury, which he held in plurality with Horsenden until his death. In 1745 he moved to Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, as chaplain to Sir Jonathan Cope at Bruern Abbey.<br>
<br>In the Oxfordshire election of 1754, Stone was agent in Chipping Norton on behalf of the whig candidates. He was described by Lady Susan Keck as &#145;a good man, but slow for a very celebrated canvasser&#146;  (Robson, 50). Stone was rewarded for his service with his appointment in 1755 as a JP for Oxfordshire, where he was active in enforcing the poor law, and it is in this capacity that he appears most frequently in local records.<br>
<br>On 25 April 1763 Stone wrote to George Parker, second earl of Macclesfield, president of the Royal Society, describing the use of dried willow bark as a remedy for fevers and agues. He explained that for some time he had suffered from &#145;aguistic intermitting disorders&#146;, which may have been malaria  (Stone, 195). About 1757 he had &#145;accidentally&#146; tasted willow bark and noted its extreme bitterness and its resemblance to the bark of the cinchona tree (quinine) from Peru. Arguing from the doctrine of signatures&#151;&#145;that many natural maladies carry their cures along with them, or that their remedies lie not far from their causes&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;Stone concluded that the willow tree that &#145;delights in a moist or wet soil&#146;  (ibid.) might provide an antidote for agues that chiefly abounded in that environment. He therefore experimented by gathering about a pound weight of willow bark from the shoots of pollarded willows, dried it for more than three months in a bag on the outside of a baker's oven, pounded and sifted it. He dosed himself, using very small quantities at first, but finding that the powder had a salutary effect, increased the dose to two scruples repeated every four hours. To his delight &#145;the ague was soon removed&#146;  (ibid., , 196).<br>
<br>During the next five years Stone had continued to administer powdered dried willow bark to about fifty people suffering from agues or fevers, and in almost every case it achieved the same success. In treating those fevers that appeared to be more resistant to willow bark, he added a small quantity of quinine. No other accompanying treatment was used. Stone concluded that quinine was more effective than willow bark, but that in other respects their action was similar. He observed also that powered dried willow bark was &#145;a safe medicine&#146;  (Stone, 198), but in this he would prove mistaken. In this way Stone had accidentally stumbled on salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin.<br>
<br>Stone's letter to Macclesfield was read before the Royal Society on 2 June 1763 and published in volume 53 of its <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> that year. Willow bark thereafter received occasional mention in herbals, and nineteenth-century pharmacists experimented in producing salicylic acid from willow bark and meadowsweet. Unacceptable side-effects were mitigated by the development in 1853 of a new compound between acetyl chloride and sodium salicylate which proved more digestible, but it was not until 1897 that Felix Hoffman synthesized salicylic acid in a pure and stable chemical form. This was produced commercially by Hoffman and Heinrich Dreser in 1899, and was marketed by Bayer under the name &#145;aspirin&#146;, derived from <i>Spiraea</i>, then the Latin name for meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>).<br>
<br>Stone's interests also included astronomy. Following the transit of Venus observed on 6 June 1761 he published <span class="italic">The whole doctrine of parallaxes explained &hellip; by an arithmetical and geometrical construction of the transit of Venus</span> in 1763. One purpose of the book was to identify places where the next transit, of 1769, could best be seen. A second edition followed in 1768.<br>
<br>In January 1764 a fire destroyed Bruern Abbey and so ended Stone's chaplaincy there. He was still rector of Horsenden and Drayton, but continued to live in Chipping Norton, occupying the remaining four years of his life by serving as assistant curate for Churchill and Cornwell, and by applying himself more assiduously to his duties as a magistrate. Stone died intestate in Chipping Norton on 26 November 1768 and was buried at Horsenden on 2 December. Administration of his estate was granted on 2 January 1769 to his son Edward.<br>
