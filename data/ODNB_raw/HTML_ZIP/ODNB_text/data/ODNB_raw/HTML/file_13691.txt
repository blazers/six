<span class="headword">Hooke,  Nathaniel</span>, Jacobite first Baron Hooke  (1664&#150;1738), <span class="occ">Jacobite politician</span>, was born at Corballis, co. Meath, the third son of John Hooke, a merchant of Drogheda, and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of Christopher Hooke of Alway, Gloucestershire. His grandfather Thomas Hooke was a merchant and alderman of Dublin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13689/', "John Hooke")</script>, serjeant-at-law, was his eldest brother. In 1679 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, but he left almost immediately, possibly on account of his religious opinions, which were puritan. He went to Glasgow University in 1680, but soon moved to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he was admitted a sizar on 6 July 1681, leaving Cambridge as he had left Glasgow, without taking a degree. He then went abroad, joining the earl of Argyll in the Netherlands. In 1685 he landed with the duke of Monmouth at Lyme Regis, acting as the duke's private independent chaplain. When Monmouth passed into Somerset at the beginning of July, Hooke was sent secretly to London with Henry Danvers to raise an insurrection in the city. He was exempted from the general pardon issued on 10 March 1686, but in 1688 he gave himself up and was pardoned after what later enemies would claim were &#145;some services&#146; involving &#145;a good deal of treachery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 6.548).<br>
<br>Hooke then became a loyal servant of James II and converted to Roman Catholicism, though it was said that his conversion did not occur until the court went into exile at St Germain-en-Laye  (ibid.). After James's abdication Hooke joined Viscount Dundee in Scotland, but in May 1689 was captured at Chester and committed to the Tower of London. He was released on 12 February 1690 and travelled to Ireland, where he served in the Jacobite army at the battle of the Boyne, and then entered the French service in the Irish regiment of Galmoy. He was examined regarding Jacobite plots in March 1696. Hooke was in attendance upon King James in 1701, but received a discharge from his service in that year so that he could take service &#145;under other princes&#146;  (ibid., 4.3). In 1702 Hooke entered into communication with the duke of Marlborough; the next year he held a command in the regiment of Sparre, and served with the French army in Flanders and on the Moselle. In 1704 he married Eleanor Susan, sometime maid of honour to the exiled queen-dowager. She was the daughter of Donogh, or Denis, MacCarthy and Catherine Douvns. They had one son, James Nathaniel Hooke (1705&#150;1744), and a daughter, Louise Sophia Fran&ccedil;oise (<i>bap</i>. 1710), sometime governess of the royal children of France. In August 1705 Hooke went on a mission to the Scottish Jacobites in company with his brother John, and in 1706 he obtained letters of naturalization in France and took part in the battle of Ramillies. In April 1707 he again went to Scotland, with Lieutenant-Colonel John Murray, to confer with the Jacobites. The next year he became a brigadier in the French army (3 March 1708), was created Baron Hooke of Hooke Castle, co. Waterford (in the Jacobite peerage), and was present at the Dunkirk expedition of that year, and at Malplaquet in the next.<br>
<br>Hooke had now wearied of negotiating schemes for rebellion with the Jacobites in Scotland, and refused in 1709 to go again as an emissary. He is probably the Mr Hooke who appears as a correspondent of the duke of Marlborough in 1710, and in 1711 he went to Dresden on a diplomatic mission from Louis XIV to Frederick Augustus, king of Poland and elector of Saxony, but this negotiation was superseded by the general arrangements for peace at Utrecht. Hooke took no active part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. He communicated in that year with John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair, British ambassador in Paris, but there is nothing to prove that he turned traitor to the Jacobite cause; it is more probable that in his relations with Stair he was acting as a spy in the Jacobite interest. Plans were, however, afoot in 1716 to appoint him Jacobite ambassador to the Holy Roman emperor. On 18 March 1718 he became a <i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i> in the French army, though he was at this time heavily afflicted with rheumatism. Despite his protestations he was accused of being, and, on account of his support for Marischal, probably was, the active leader of the court opposition against Mar, Kellie, and Middleton, who in 1718 described him as &#145;no good man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 6.548). He was still in favour with James III (James Francis Edward Stuart), who appointed him envoy to Prussia on 12 May 1718, perhaps because he was still active in organizing his relations in London to cause trouble for the Hanoverian regime. On 1 January 1720 his letters of French naturalization were confirmed and registered, and on 27 February 1721 he became a knight commander of the order of St Louis. Hooke married his second wife, Helen de St Jean, widow respectively of the Sieur O'Brien and the Sieur MacCarthy, shortly before his death in France on 25 October 1738.<br>
<br>Lord Hooke's correspondence from 1703 to 1707, partly transcribed by his nephew, Nathaniel Hooke (<i>d</i>. 1763), the historian of Rome, is now in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This was edited, with a memoir by W. D. Macray, for the Roxburgh Club in 1870&#150;71. Portions of Hooke's correspondence had previously appeared in <span class="italic">R&eacute;volutions d'&Eacute;cosse et d'Irelande en 1707, 1708, et 1709</span>, published at The Hague in 1758, and in James Macpherson's <span class="italic">Original Papers</span> (1775).<br>
