<span class="headword">Towerson,  Gabriel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, on 2 July 1635, the son of William Towerson. After attending St Paul's School, Westminster, he was admitted to Queen's College, Oxford, in Michaelmas term 1650, where he was the Pauline exhibitioner until 1659. He matriculated on 27 February 1651, graduating BA on 17 June 1654 and proceeding MA on 21 April 1657. In 1657 his father petitioned Richard Cromwell, then chancellor of the university, to use his influence with the warden and fellows of All Souls to admit his son to a fellowship. He was admitted fellow there in 1659, losing his fellowship in 1663 following his appointment to the college rectory of Welwyn in Hertfordshire, a living he held until his death. At some point he married, and between 1670 and 1687 he baptized fourteen of his children at Welwyn, seven of whom survived him. From 1680 their mother is named in the register, Ann, though it is not as yet known whether she was his only, or a second, wife; Towerson was a widower by the time he died.<br>
<br>Towerson regarded writing as an important part of his ministry and pursued a long-term goal of adult education in the basics of the Christian religion. His work <span class="italic">An Explication of the Catechism of the Church of England</span> (published in four parts between 1676 and 1688) was rewarded with a Lambeth DD in 1678. He felt this huge compendium to be necessary because the prayer book catechism was &#145;written only for the younger sort&#146;, and that therefore something more substantial was required for adults  (Towerson, <span class="italic">Explication</span>, pt 1, introduction). He wrote that catechists should require from their audience as they grew &#145;some further deductions, and applications, and illustrations, so, to contribute to so useful a work, as well as to build men up in their most holy Faith, I have undertaken the following Explication&#146;  (ibid.). Towerson defined belief as primarily an &#145;inevident perswasion of the mind&#146;  (ibid., 1.20), but asserted that belief needed to be supported by a secondary appeal to evidence, to provide which he engaged in an expansive and reflective use of quotations from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the fathers.<br>
<br>Towerson's <span class="italic">Explication</span> reached nearly 1500 pages in folio. Repeat editions of various sections of the work, in both folio and octavo, showed that he succeeded in supporting adult readers anxious to grow in their understanding of the faith. Out of the strong catechetical tradition in the literature of English Christianity, Towerson was one of the few authors who abandoned the pattern of question and answer and opted for a text in continuous prose. His work evinces the didactic drive of the Church of England in this era. There was a determination to resource the faithful with the means of their own improvement. The <span class="italic">Explication</span> also underlined the commitment of the Church of England to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. When the <span class="italic">Explication</span> is considered in conjunction with Thomas Comber's <span class="italic">Companion to the Temple</span>, which explained church services, the Anglican prayer book was reaffirmed in grand style in a century within which it had not only been doubted but even proscribed, in the 1640s and 1650s. Even though his work was not reprinted after his death Towerson remains important because his massive work, for all its discursiveness, showed the effort that the Church of England was willing to expend in an age that was regarded as being marked by popular ignorance and apathy.<br>
<br>Towerson received an additional appointment as rector of St Andrew Undershaft, London, in 1692. He was alarmed at the inability of most people there to sing and an organ was installed. His <span class="italic">Sermon Concerning Vocal and Instrumental Musick in the Church</span> (1696) was delivered on the day that the new organ was first used. He remarked that &#145;The Organ &hellip; both by the Lowdness, and the Harmoniousness thereof doth, with a kind of grateful Violence, carry the Voices of Men along with it&#146;  (p. 26). Towerson not only wanted people to have an informed faith, but he also wanted them to be able to express themselves as a congregation as part of their duty to God. Towerson died on 14 October 1697 and was buried at Welwyn a week later. The funeral sermon, delivered by George Stanhope, recalled that Towerson had only ever sought preferment so that he could better provide for his family. His estate was divided among his surviving children.<br>
