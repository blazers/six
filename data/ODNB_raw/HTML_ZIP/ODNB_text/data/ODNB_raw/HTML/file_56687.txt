<span class="headword">Vernet <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cunningham; <em>other married name </em>Thornton]</span>,  Helen Monica Mabel</span>  (1875/6&#150;1956), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born in 1875 or 1876, but little else is known about her early life. She had a brief career as an actress, playing small parts, but this ended on her marriage, at the age of seventeen, to Spencer Thornton, a stockbroker. Influenced perhaps by her husband's occupation, Helen Thornton became a prolific gambler and quickly exhausted most of the &pound;8000 left her by her father, who had died when she was still a child. The dissipation of her inheritance was accelerated when, following a serious illness which affected her lungs, she was advised by her doctor to spend more time in the open air: she opted to go racing several times a week. Her marriage to Thornton was annulled, possibly because his income proved insufficient for her needs, and she subsequently married another stockbroker, Robert Vernet.<br>
<br>In her early racing days Helen Thornton became aware that many women wished to bet in small amounts which bookmakers on Tattersall's rails were reluctant to accept. Entry to Tattersall's ring was more expensive than to normal enclosures and the bookmakers expected their customers to wager accordingly and not in denominations as low as 5 or 10<i>s</i>. During the 1918 racing season Mrs Vernet, as she had by then become, let it be known among her friends that she would accept bets of this order handed to her in writing. This was illegal, and as her clientele increased the professional bookmakers objected and had her warned off by racecourse officials.<br>
<br>However, Arthur Bendir, who had essentially established the bookmaking firm of Ladbrokes in 1902, saw the economic potential and publicity value of employing Helen Vernet as the first female licensed bookmaker on British racecourses. He was proved right and during her career with Ladbrokes, which began in 1919, she never earned less than &pound;20,000 a year from her commission on gambling receipts. In 1928 she purchased a partnership in the firm. This was the year that the totalizator first came to British racing. It catered for the small-scale better but many gamblers still preferred the interaction with bookmakers, who offered character as well as negotiable odds. Mrs Vernet contrasted with the brash personalities of many of her male counterparts, being charming and extremely chic.<br>
<br>Helen Vernet's second marriage, coupled with her commission from bookmaking, allowed her to live in style in a succession of elegant, furnished London houses in Gray's Inn, Albany, and finally at 49 Eaton Place, Westminster. She also owned Cunningham Lodge at Hove where she installed her mother. She was fond of dancing and allegedly insisted that her clerks, who accompanied her to provincial meetings requiring overnight stays, should be both handsome and expert dancers. For holidays she favoured the Riviera where she could gamble in the casinos. She admitted to one weakness: a fondness for gigolos.<br>
<br>Helen Vernet continued with Ladbrokes until 1955, often in later years, as Parkinson's disease and arthritis took hold, being pushed to her position in a wheelchair by her &#145;bookmaker's runner&#146; (or assistant), Alf Simmons. Her death, on 30 March 1956, at 49 Eaton Place, was from a combination of bronchial pneumonia and Parkinson's disease. Her estate was valued at &pound;7573, &pound;500 of which went to Alf Simmons. Five years after Helen Vernet died, betting shops were introduced to Britain: although they brought money to her old firm, she would not have appreciated their lack of glamour.<br>
