<span class="headword">Baring,  Rowland Thomas</span>, second earl of Cromer  (1877&#150;1953), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 29 November 1877 at Cairo. He was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30583/', "Evelyn Baring, later first earl of Cromer (1841&#150;1917)")</script>, diplomat, and his first wife, Ethel Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1898), second daughter of Sir Rowland Stanley Errington, eleventh baronet. A bad attack of typhoid contracted in Egypt in his boyhood affected his health all his life. He was educated at Eton College, where he made many friends, but left early by his father's wish, without particular distinction, in order to learn foreign languages. In 1900 he entered the diplomatic service, serving as third and second secretary between 1902 and 1906 at Cairo, Tehran, and St Petersburg. He then transferred to the Foreign Office and acted as private secretary to successive permanent under-secretaries of state between 1907 and 1911, when he resigned the service. On 4 April 1908 he married Lady Ruby Florence Mary Elliot (1886&#150;1961), daughter of the fourth earl of Minto. They had a son and two daughters. His wife was of constant help to him in his career and his family life was ideal.<br>
<br>In 1913 Lord Errington, as he then was, became a managing director of Baring Brothers and, in a short time, acquired a useful knowledge of finance. In 1914 he joined the Grenadier Guards, serving as a lieutenant in the special reserve until 1920. In 1915&#150;16 he was aide-de-camp to successive viceroys of India (Lord Hardinge of Penshurst and Lord Chelmsford). In 1916 he was appointed assistant private secretary and equerry to King George V. The prince of Wales wanted Cromer (as he had become on the death of his father in 1917) as his private secretary in 1918, but the king refused to release him from his duties. Cromer acted as chief of staff during the duke of Connaught's visit to India (1920&#150;21), and returned there with the prince of Wales in the same capacity (1921&#150;2). His relationship with the prince of Wales was not entirely smooth, as Cromer attempted to act as a restraining influence.<br>
<br>In 1922 Cromer was appointed lord chamberlain, an office which he held with distinction until 1938; it was under Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government in 1924 that the appointment was changed from a political one, made by the prime minister of the day, to a permanent one, made by the monarch. He continued in office under Edward VIII, although with some reluctance, as he considered that &#145;war was in effect declared [by the new king] against the old gang&#146;  (Ziegler, 258). In 1938 he became a permanent lord-in-waiting, serving both George VI and Elizabeth II. Apprehension about the status of the monarchy during the First World War, despite the devotion to duty of the king and queen, had been expressed in 1918, notably by Cromer himself and by Lord Esher. This disquiet was soon dissipated but Cromer never forgot the need for the monarchy to adjust itself to the post-war social revolution. By his tact and imperturbability and his liberal and shrewd interpretation of his diverse functions, he gave general satisfaction and very little cause for offence, according the same serious but always sympathetic attention to his social as to his political functions. Probably his work as censor of plays (one of the main duties of the lord chamberlain until 1968) interested him most. Cromer came to know a great deal about the theatre, and in this contentious field his tact and sympathy earned the respect and gratitude of dramatists and actors. In his administration and reformation of royal household affairs his business experience stood him in good stead. A sense of humour lightened the burden of his responsibilities, if on social occasions his determination to keep inviolable the confidences of his office sometimes kept it in check.<br>
<br>Cromer was of middle height and slim build. Never robust, he enjoyed shooting and riding but his favourite recreations were reading, family golf, and gardening. A chief virtue of his character was an endearing modesty, to which were added shrewd common sense, moral courage, and a far-sighted liberalism of outlook. He was devoted to children, and young people were always at ease in his company. He devoted much time and trouble to the Cheyne Hospital for children, and was president of the National Hospital for Chest Diseases. At various times he was a British government director of the Suez Canal Company and a director of the P. &amp; O. and the British India steam navigation companies and various banking and insurance concerns. Cromer was not a rich man, and these City interests were of importance to him since the office of lord chamberlain carried no pension rights. In 1934&#150;5 he was president of the MCC. He received many high British honours and a variety of foreign orders. He was sworn of the privy council in 1922 and rose to the rank of grand cross in the orders of the Bath, the Indian Empire, and in the Royal Victorian Order, and received the Royal Victorian Chain in 1935. Cromer died suddenly on 13 May 1953 at 20 Devonshire Place, London. He was survived by his wife and was succeeded by his only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49616/', "(George) Rowland Stanley Baring (1918&#150;1991)")</script>, who was governor of the Bank of England from 1961 to 1966.<br>
