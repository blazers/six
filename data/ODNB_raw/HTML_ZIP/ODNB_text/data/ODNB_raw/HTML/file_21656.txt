<span class="headword">Payne,  Thomas</span>  (1752&#150;1831), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in London on 10 October 1752, the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21655/', "Thomas Payne (1716x18&#150;1799)")</script>, bookseller and publisher, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (<i>d</i>. in or before 1775). He was educated by M. Metayer in Charterhouse Square, London, and trained in modern and classical languages to equip him for the family business. He entered into partnership with his father in 1776, and succeeded him in 1790.<br>
<br>The original L-shaped premises at Mews Gate, Castle Street, London, acted as a coffee house and bookshop. It rapidly became too cramped for the many men of letters&#151;including Charles Lamb&#151;who visited and 88 Schomberg House, Pall Mall, was acquired. Schomberg House soon became widely recognized as a popular literary centre. Payne traded alone after his father's death in 1799 and then took into partnership his apprentice Henry Foss in 1813. The business was renamed Payne and Foss, though Charles Lamb playfully called it &#145;Pain &amp; Fuss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Diary of Frances Burney</span>, 2.130&#150;31).<br>
<br>In 1817 Payne became master of the Stationers' Company. By 1820 his poor health meant that he had to give up travelling in search of books. Previous successes had included large collections from the libraries of Dean Lloyd, the Revd Henry Homer, and the last keeper of the seals of France, M. Chr&eacute;tien Fran&ccedil;ois de Lamoignon, as well as the Borromeo collection of novels and romances. Such acquisitions meant that moving to the larger 81 Pall Mall became necessary in 1821.<br>
<br>Payne retired in 1825 and was succeeded by his nephew John Payne, but Payne and Foss continued until 1850. John Payne and his wife, Sarah Burney, then retired to Rome, where they spent their remaining years in the company of such distinguished figures as Cardinal Antonelli.<br>
<br>Thomas Payne died at 81 Pall Mall on 15 March 1831, after an attack of apoplexy on the 8th. He was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields on 24 March 1831. At the time of his death he was considered the father of the London booksellers.<br>
