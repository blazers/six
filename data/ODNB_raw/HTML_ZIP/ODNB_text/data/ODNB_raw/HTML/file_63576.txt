<span class="headword">Darton,  William</span>  (1755&#150;1819), <span class="occ">publisher and writer</span>, was born at the Coach and Six Horses, Tottenham, Middlesex, where he was baptized at the parish church on 14 November 1755. He was the second of three children (two boys and one girl) of John Darton (<i>d</i>. 1774), an innkeeper, and of Ann Bramton (1717&#150;1804), who had been a widow when John Darton married her in 1750/1751. He was apprenticed for seven years to Thomas Dent, a London engraver, and following the death of his father in 1774 returned to Tottenham, where he ran a village store. In 1777 he joined the Society of Friends, and on 2 July 1778 he married Hannah Pace (1755&#150;1822) of Spitalfields, herself a Quaker; they were to have eleven children (five girls and six boys). In 1787 he moved to London and set up as engraver, stationer, and printer in White Lion Alley, Birchin Lane. In this year he published what seems to be his first book, <span class="italic">Little Truths Better than Great Fables</span>, which blends information with moral teaching in the then approved style for children. He moved to 55 Gracechurch Street, London, in the next year, and in 1791 formed a partnership with Joseph Harvey (1764&#150;1841). Harvey, also a Quaker, was primarily a printer, while Darton saw to the publishing side, and in some thirty years, starting from nothing, a flourishing business had been built up with a distinctive house style. The firm's adult publications were mostly of Quaker origin, and included anti-slavery literature, but it was best known for juvenile books, several of which, like <span class="italic">Little Truths</span>, were written and probably illustrated by Darton himself. Among the firm's more famous authors were Maria Hack, Priscilla Wakefield, the grammarian Lindley Murray, and Jane and Ann Taylor, whose two volumes of <span class="italic">Original Poems, for Infant Minds</span> were published in 1804 and 1805. In 1810 William Darton's son Samuel Darton (1785&#150;1840) became a partner in the firm, and Darton sen., though still a partner, went to live in Plaistow, Essex, where he died on 13 August 1819.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63576"></a><span class="headword">William Darton</span>  (1781&#150;1854), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, the eldest son and second child (of eleven) of William and Hannah Darton, was born at Tottenham on 2 February 1781. He was educated at the Friends' school, Clerkenwell, London, and at Ackworth (Quaker) school, Yorkshire, and from 1795 was apprenticed to his father. In 1804 he set up his own business in Holborn Hill, London, and like his father specialized in children's books. He also published jigsaw puzzles and table games notable for their decorative detail. Among the firm's authors were the unidentified Arabella Argus, Mary Belson Elliott, and Mary Robson Hughs. He was a skilled engraver, and finished the work on <span class="italic">A Complete Atlas of the English Counties</span>, begun by Thomas Dix and published from Holborn Hill under their joint names in 1822. On 3 May 1808 he married Phoebe Harvey (1777&#150;1860) of Maldon, Essex. There were five children of whom the eldest, John Maw Darton (1809&#150;1881), became a partner in the Holborn Hill firm. William Darton retired in 1836 and died on 28 July 1854 at 47 Hemingford Terrace, Islington, London.<br>
