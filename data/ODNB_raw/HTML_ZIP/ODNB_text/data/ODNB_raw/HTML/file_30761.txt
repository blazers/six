<span class="headword">Anderson, Dame  Kitty</span>  (1903&#150;1979), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 4 July 1903 in St Anne's, Lancashire, the only daughter and eldest of three children of John Herbert Anderson, and his wife, Lizzie Dawson. Her father moved from St Anne's to Middlesbrough as a chartered accountant in private practice. From the High School for Girls, Saltburn by the Sea, where she was head girl, Kitty Anderson went on to Royal Holloway College, London, the first girl from the school ever to win a university place. There she read history. In 1925 she went to the London Day Training College, and took a teacher's diploma. She had always wanted to teach, and indeed had announced her intention of becoming a headmistress on her first day at high school. In 1926 she took a post at a co-educational school in Hull, Craven Street secondary school, but in 1930 she went back to Royal Holloway, as Christie scholar, to work for a PhD in Elizabethan history. She received her doctorate in 1933.<br>
<br>Kitty Anderson's next teaching post was at Burlington School, London, an old charitable foundation. There she very soon became second mistress. At the beginning of the Second World War, in September 1939, she left to become headmistress of King's Norton Grammar School, Birmingham. At first the school was divided between Birmingham and Gloucestershire, half of the girls and staff being evacuated. She had to divide her time between the two parts of the school. Nevertheless she was well known, as headmistress, not only for her excellent history teaching, but also for giving to the school a sense of unity and purpose. She stayed at King's Norton for five years, and then in 1944 became head of the North London Collegiate School, a direct-grant girls' school, and there she stayed until her retirement.<br>
<br>During her twenty years at North London, Kitty Anderson became an outstanding figure in the educational world. She was a member of the Carr&#150;Saunders committee on education for commerce from 1946 to 1949; president of the Association of Headmistresses from 1954 to 1956, and a member of the National Advisory Council for the Training and Supply of Teachers from 1953 to 1961. She was a member of the University Grants Committee (1959&#150;61) and of the committee on higher education chaired by Lord Robbins (1961&#150;3). In 1966 she became a member of the Public Schools Commission, under the chairmanship of John Newsom. This was a committee set up by government with an explicitly political task: &#145;To advise on the best way of integrating the public schools with the state system of education &hellip; and to create a socially mixed entry into the schools, in order to reduce the divisive influence which they now exert.&#146; Much as she enjoyed the work on this committee, travelling round with congenial colleagues to visit various schools, the terms of reference can never have pleased her. For she aimed always, as far as possible, to separate party politics from education. And when the first report was published, in 1968, she, with two colleagues, T. E. B. Howarth and John Davies, signed a minority report. The committee as a whole, they argued, had concentrated too exclusively on the social divisiveness of public schools, taking social reform as their first priority. They had lost sight of two major educational goals: the provision of boarding education, and educational provision for the less able. The courage of refusing to sign the report was typical of Kitty Anderson, and the clearly stated grounds of her refusal equally characteristic. She was above everything interested in education, and she did not regard education as a kind of social manipulation.<br>
<br>When, in 1965, she retired from the North London Collegiate, of which she had been an outstanding headmistress, despite her public commitments, she became chairman of the Girls' Public Day School Trust. No more happy appointment could have been made. She now had twenty-three direct-grant schools to look after. In 1965 the political threat to the direct-grant system was just apparent. She was its greatest defender. She took an astonishingly well-informed interest in individual schools, and became the friend and adviser of each of their headmistresses.<br>
<br>Kitty Anderson was small and birdlike, full of energy, and a great talker. Words and laughter seemed to bubble out of her. But she also had the gift of instant sympathy, so that people readily confided in her. They always felt better for it. She was not only sensible, but reassuringly firm in her beliefs. All her life she took pleasure in a wide variety of things, including clothes, and school plays and concerts. It was this enthusiasm that made her both a great teacher and a valued friend.<br>
<br>Kitty Anderson was appointed DBE in 1961. She became an honorary fellow of the College of Preceptors in 1966 and received an honorary LLD from Hull (1967) and a DUniv from York (1971). She retired from the trust, her health by now failing, in 1975. She went back to live in Yorkshire, and died in Northallerton on 15 January 1979.<br>
