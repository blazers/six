<span class="headword">Barlow,  Jane</span>  (1857&#150;1917), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 17 April 1857 at Clontarf, Dublin, the eldest daughter of the Revd James William Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1913), later vice-provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and his wife, Mary Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1893/4). Barlow was educated at home and was said to have been &#145;frail in body and slight in build&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Book Lover</span>, 141).<br>
<br>Using the pseudonyms Antares Skorpios and Felix Ryark, Barlow was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Dublin University Review</span> from 1866. Her first poem was published in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> in 1886. However, it was through her stories that she gained popularity. <span class="italic">Bogland Studies</span> appeared in 1892 and contained narrative poems making abundant use of the supposed dialect of the peasantry, including words such as &#145;begorrah&#146;, &#145;musha&#146;, and &#145;bedad&#146;. <span class="italic">Irish Idylls</span> was also published in 1892. Set in the fictional Connemara village of Lisconnel, the tales deal with the peasantry in a sentimental way. Lady Augusta Gregory was attracted by Barlow's account of peasant life and declared that <span class="italic">Irish Idylls</span> was &#145;one of my sermon books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, xx).<br>
<br>Barlow lived quietly in Raheny, near Dublin, for most of her adult life. She never married. In February 1893 Douglas Hyde described her as &#145;the great &#147;incognita&#148;&#146;  (Daly, 160). Hill walking was her main pastime. A friend of a number of Irish literary figures of the period, Barlow knew William Butler Yeats and Katherine Tynan, who first met her in 1893 at an afternoon party hosted by the artist Sarah Purser. Tynan noted Barlow's shyness and observed that she found it difficult to speak to anyone  (Tynan, <span class="italic">Middle Years</span>, 74). Tynan and Barlow became good friends and corresponded for over twenty years. Purser, who maintained a weekly correspondence with Barlow for some time, painted a portrait of her in 1894. She also illustrated a number of Barlow's stories and painted portraits of her mother and father.<br>
<br>Barlow's novels were usually critical of the Irish landowning class. <span class="italic">Kerrigan's Quality</span> (1894) describes the effect of the famine and evictions from the viewpoint of a returned Irish-Australian emigrant. In 1895 William Butler Yeats chose <span class="italic">Irish Idylls</span> as one of his &#145;Best Irish Books&#146;, praising Barlow's mastery of the &#145;circumstances of peasant life&#146; but regretting that she seemed &#145;to shrink from its roughness and its tumult&#146;  (<span class="italic">W. B. Yeats: Uncollected Prose</span>, 370). <span class="italic">Strangers at Lisconnel</span>, a second series of stories, was published in 1895. Further collections followed: <span class="italic">Maureen's Fairing</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Mrs Martin's Company</span> (1896), and <span class="italic">A Creel of Irish Stories</span> (1897). Barlow's work was much admired in America, where her books went into many editions. In her novel <span class="italic">Flaws</span> (1911) she gives a satirical view of middle- and upper-class Anglicized protestants in the south of Ireland, depicting them as full of petty jealousies and snobbishness.<br>
<br>Although Barlow subscribed to the foundation of the Abbey Theatre, her one play, <span class="italic">A Bunch of Lavender</span> (1911), which was produced there, was a notable failure. She continued to write and publish until ten days before her death. Her last sketch, &#145;Rescues&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> in April 1917. Jane Barlow died on 17 April 1917 at St Valerie, Bray, co. Wicklow. Her last novel, <span class="italic">In Mio's Country</span>, was published posthumously in 1917.<br>
