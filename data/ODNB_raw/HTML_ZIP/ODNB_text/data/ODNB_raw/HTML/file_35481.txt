<span class="headword">Perks, Sir  Robert William</span>, first baronet  (1849&#150;1934), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born at Old Brentford on 24 April 1849, the elder son of the Revd George Thomas Perks (1819&#150;1877), president of the Wesleyan conference in 1873, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of James Alexander Dodds, an Edinburgh architect of promise who died young.<br>
<br>Perks was educated at New Kingswood School, Bath (1858&#150;65), which was then exclusively for Wesleyan ministers' sons, and at King's College, London (1867&#150;71), where he gained honours in classics, English, and modern languages and won many open prizes. He competed for four years in succession for the Indian Civil Service, missing entrance each year by only a few places. This was a great disappointment at the time, but he lived to regard it as the most fortunate escape of his life. Turning to law he was articled to the firm of Messrs De Jersey and Micklem in the City, and qualified as a solicitor in 1875. In the following year he became the partner in London of Henry Hartley Fowler (afterwards Viscount Wolverhampton), a fellow Wesleyan, with whom he remained for twenty-five years. The firm specialized in railway and parliamentary practice, and by sheer business acumen Perks made a reputation as a lawyer who could pilot company bills through parliament. He studied intensively all railway law, and had little difficulty in being appointed solicitor (1879&#150;92) to the London Metropolitan District Railway Company; he was later (1901&#150;5) chairman of the company during its transition from steam to electricity. He was associated with Messrs T. A. and C. Walker of Westminster, contractors, in various construction and engineering works, including Barry docks and railway, the Severn Tunnel, Manchester Ship Canal, Preston docks, the harbour works that created the port of Buenos Aires, the Rio de Janeiro harbour works, and a railway tunnel through the Andes. After leaving Messrs Walker in 1912 he joined Messrs Macarthur, Perks &amp; Co., a firm of dock and railway contractors in Ottawa and New York.<br>
<br>His legal and business career established, Perks began his political life in 1886, serving as Liberal MP for the Louth division of Lincolnshire between July 1892 and January 1910, when he retired, somewhat disillusioned with the House of Commons (he subsequently said of his service there that &#145;there was no period of his life so fruitlessly spent, no time so absolutely wasted&#146;). In this capacity he gained a reputation for his vigorous (not to say abrasive) advocacy of the interests of his rural electors and of nonconformist concerns, earning the sobriquet of Member for nonconformity. He was the moving spirit behind the nonconformist caucus in the house during these years, being co-founder (in 1898) and chairman (until 1908) of the Nonconformist Parliamentary Council (or Committee), which had 200 members in the 1906 parliament, although it was nowhere near as effective a pressure group as Perks liked to believe. He was closely identified with a number of legislative measures to redress nonconformist grievances, notably the <span class="roman">Nonconformist Marriage Act</span> of 1898 (which removed the need for the attendance of the civil registrar at weddings held in non-Anglican churches); he advocated passive resistance against the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902, supported disestablishment of the Church of England (which he regarded as the Anglo-Catholic church), and promoted the temperance cause. Of strongly imperialist views, which caused him to be known as &#145;Imperial Perks&#146;, he endorsed the South African War and was involved in the founding of both the Imperial Liberal Council in 1900 and the Liberal League in 1902, the latter under the presidency of Lord Rosebery, with Perks as treasurer and later vice-president.<br>
<br>Perks's business and political skills also found expression in his service of Methodism, both in the local church and at connexional level. Among the first lay members of the Wesleyan conference in 1878, he rose to become one of the denomination's most influential laymen, serving on many key committees, including the committee of privileges (to which he was lay secretary in 1882&#150;92). An advocate of Methodist union from 1878, he worked tirelessly for its consummation, and, when the Wesleyan, Primitive, and United Methodists finally merged in 1932, Perks was elected unanimously as the first vice-president of the Methodist church. With similar success, he inaugurated the Wesleyan Twentieth Century Fund in 1898, which set out to raise 1 million guineas from one million Methodists, the intention being that nobody was to contribute more than 1 guinea in their own name. Through Perks's efforts as treasurer, and his personal contribution of over &pound;10,000, when the fund closed in 1908 &pound;1,074,000 had been raised. This was used for a variety of purposes, including the construction of the Westminster Central Hall (opened 1912) as Wesleyanism's connexional headquarters on the site of the Royal Aquarium, facing Westminster Abbey. Equally ambitious, but conspicuously less successful, was his Methodist Brotherhood, launched in 1907 as a sort of denominational welfare state, exploiting the worldwide Methodist family to provide facilities for emigration, employment, financial loans, and old-age support. Progressively watered down, the scheme was finally overtaken by the Liberal social reforms (which Perks regarded as socialism) and by the First World War.<br>
<br>Perks was created a baronet on 24 July 1908, but is believed to have declined a peerage as he disliked pomp and ceremony. He had married on 24 April 1878 Edith (<i>d</i>. 1943), youngest daughter of William Mewburn of Wykham Park, Banbury, and had one son and four daughters, of whom the eldest predeceased her father. Perks died at his home, 11 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, on 30 November 1934, and was succeeded as second baronet by his son, Robert Malcolm Mewburn (1892&#150;1979).<br>
