<span class="headword">Walker,  William</span>  (1840&#150;1931), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born in Aberdeen, the son of James Walker from Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was a Chartist and one of the last hand-loom weavers, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dingwall, who was originally from Strath Kildonan in Sutherland. His education appears to have finished when he left Blackfriars Street dame-school, Aberdeen, at the age of eight, although later he studied at the mechanics' institute. He started work for the Equitable Loan Company, rising from lowly message boy to successful managing director; his profession at his death was given as retired pawnbroker. Writing and books were his main outside interests, culminating in the local classic <span class="italic">The Bards of Bon-Accord</span> (1887), a thorough study of north-east poets from Barbour to the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Walker's extensive interest in balladry, folk-song, and related literature led to his becoming one of Professor Francis James Child's principal informants for <span class="italic">English and Scottish Popular Ballads</span> (1882&#150;98). In addition he aided Gavin Greig and James Duncan in amassing their monumental north-east folk-song collection in the decade before the First World War. After their premature deaths, he oversaw the final editing by Alexander Keith of the classical balladry in the collection, which was published as <span class="italic">Last Leaves of Traditional Ballads and Ballad Airs</span> (1925). In 1915 Walker had published <span class="italic">Peter Buchan and other Papers</span>, a celebration of an earlier local ballad collector whose working methods were regarded as suspect by many authorities. He persuaded Keith not only to give <span class="italic">Last Leaves</span> its unjustifiably elegiac title (the local folk-song tradition was, and still is, thriving) but also to write an introduction which was largely a justification of Peter Buchan. Walker had examined the Greig&#150;Duncan collection in 1919 and had been horrified by its catholicity (later regarded as an indicator of both comprehensiveness and authenticity). In his eyes it contained far too much that was not &#145;genuine&#146; folk-song, such as chap-book and music-hall versions, for Greig and Duncan had been uniquely thorough and non-selective in collecting all that their informants could give, altering virtually nothing in the process. Walker therefore determined that only the classical story songs (as categorized by Child) should see the light of day, in order that Aberdeenshire's reputation for fine balladry (for which he was partly responsible) should not be sullied by the publication of what he regarded as inconsequential rubbish. His great influence and standing ensured that only the <span class="italic">Last Leaves</span> ballad selection (including a statement&#151;against all the evidence&#151;that the great songs it contained had almost disappeared) ever saw the light of day and that any thought of publishing the collection in full was dismissed for almost half a century.<br>
<br>Walker amassed one of the most comprehensive and valuable libraries in private hands, covering both general song and balladry (especially works concerning Burns), general English and north-east literature, and works on theology, philosophy, and economics, in all of which he was well versed. From this foundation he wrote and published extensively&#151;newspaper articles, pamphlets, and books. The last of these contained the delightful <span class="italic">Letters on Scottish Ballads from Professor Francis J. Child to W. W. Aberdeen</span> (1930), which gave many insights into Child's mind, character, and working methods. Walker's Peter Buchan manuscripts, including the notorious <span class="italic">Songs of Silence</span>, were accepted by Harvard University after being refused by a shocked Aberdeen Public Library.<br>
<br>As well as being an expert on fiddle music (and a good performer) Walker was an authoritative collector of coins and medals. His extensive knowledge, generous, sociable, and friendly nature, together with his fund of anecdotes, songs, and fiddle tunes made him a popular local citizen respected for making a successful way in life as a typical Scottish &#145;lad o' pairts&#146;; his extensive and wide-ranging self-taught knowledge also made him an influential international authority, especially in the field of balladry. He was married for fifty-two years to Elsie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Noble; they had no children. He died at his home, 65 Argyll Place, Aberdeen, on 26 December 1931 and was buried, on 29 December, at Allenvale cemetery, Aberdeen.<br>
