<span class="headword">Locker,  Edward Hawke</span>  (1777&#150;1849), <span class="occ">hospital administrator and watercolour painter</span>, born at the parsonage house, East Malling, Kent, on 9 October 1777, was the fourth of the five surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16895/', "Captain William Locker (1731&#150;1800)")</script> and his wife, Lucy (1746/7&#150;1780), daughter of Admiral William Parry and granddaughter of Commodore Charles Brown. Locker was named after William Locker's patron Admiral Edward Hawke. He was educated at Eton College, and on 1 June 1795 entered the navy pay office as clerk (seaman's wages), a position which he held until about 1799. In October of that year he was appointed clerk to the Board of Control for affairs in India, and then to the board of naval enquiry. In 1804 he became civil secretary to Admiral Edward Pellew, Viscount Exmouth, and was with him during his commands in the East Indies (1804&#150;9), in the North Sea (1810), and in the Mediterranean (1811&#150;14). During this time he was a prize agent, engaged in the distribution of prize money, from which he himself derived considerable benefit. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1811.<br>
<br>In 1813, with Lord John Russell, Locker visited Spain during the Peninsular War, and carried dispatches to the duke of Wellington. His account, <span class="italic">Views of Spain</span>, was published in 1824, with illustrations after his own watercolours. In May 1814 he visited Napoleon at Porto Ferraio, Elba, later described by him in <span class="italic">The Plain Englishman</span> (3.375). On 28 February 1815 he married Eleanor Mary Elizabeth (1793&#150;1861), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2972/', "Revd Jonathan Boucher")</script>, a former friend of George Washington. They lived at Windsor until 1819, when Locker was appointed secretary to the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, where his father had ended his career as lieutenant-governor; in 1824 he became civil commissioner of the hospital. With Lord John Russell, John Wilson Croker (secretary to the Admiralty), the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey, and Sir Thomas Lawrence, president of the Royal Academy, he was one of the twenty-four founder members of the Athenaeum and sat on its general committee. Locker was co-founder (with Charles Knight) of <span class="italic">The Plain Englishman</span> (1820&#150;30), a periodical designed to supply its readers with &#145;useful information, in place of [the] infidel and disloyal publications&#146;  (&#145;Introduction&#146;, <span class="italic">The Plain Englishman</span>, 1824); he became the journal's editor. Its purpose was largely didactic and it advocated patriotism by lauding heroic deeds, including naval ones. Locker's friend the poet laureate Robert Southey was among its contributors.<br>
<br>At Greenwich, Locker used his astute business sense to reform the administration of the hospital, including the lead and coalmining interests of its large Northumbrian estates, employing McAdam to construct new roads to improve communication and introducing many improvements for its tenants. In 1823 he submitted a proposal to establish in the Painted Hall in the Royal Naval Hospital &#145;a gallery of pictures commemorating the distinguished services of the Royal Navy of England&#146;. This revived a scheme first put forward in 1795 by William Locker as a means of raising money for the hospital's charitable purposes, but his son's aims were predominantly didactic. The Naval Gallery received the approval of George IV: in 1824 he presented twenty-nine pictures from the Royal Collection, consisting mainly of portraits of naval commanders by Lely, Kneller, and Michael Dahl. In 1829, he added de Loutherbourg's <span class="italic">Battle of the 1st June, 1794</span> and Turner's <span class="italic">Battle of Trafalgar</span>, the only painting by Turner to have been in the Royal Collection. His support was continued by his successor, William IV, and the collection was also augmented by gifts which Locker assiduously solicited from naval families, and from the British Institution; he also encouraged commissions and presented pictures himself. The Naval Gallery was, in effect, the first gallery of national history in the country and may be seen as part of the general programme to establish national art collections and to raise the artistic reputation of the capital. Locker wrote a substantial companion to the gallery, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Celebrated Naval Commanders</span> (1832), illustrated with engravings of the collection.<br>
<br>In 1936 the collection passed into the care of the newly formed National Maritime Museum of which it forms a principal component, although still the property of the hospital. Locker's own collection, dispersed after his death, was displayed in his apartments there and included &#145;excellent specimens of Thomas Lawrence, Wilkie, Prout, Edridge, Girtin, Turner, Alexander, Chinnery, Paul Sandby, Hearne, Nicholson, Cipriani, Cozens, and Lady Farnborough&#146;  (Locker-Lampson, 73). In 1823 he contributed works from his collection to the first loan exhibition at the Old Watercolour Society. His correspondence with Robert Southey, Walter Scott, William Wilberforce, Croker, Thomas Lawrence, David Wilkie, and others reveals a many-sided interest in the events of his day, and his opinion carried weight with his contemporaries in matters of art, literature, and religion.<br>
<br>In 1844 Locker was forced to retire from his post at the hospital owing to &#145;mental failure&#146; from which he was to suffer until his death at Iver, Buckinghamshire, on 16 October 1849. He was buried at Iver. Among his children were the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16896/', "Frederick Locker-Lampson (1821&#150;1895)")</script>, and the novelist and journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16892/', "Arthur Locker (1828&#150;1893)")</script>, who became editor of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>. E. H. Locker's watercolours can be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum in London, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, and the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath.<br>
