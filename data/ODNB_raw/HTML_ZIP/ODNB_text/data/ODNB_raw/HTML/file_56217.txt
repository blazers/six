<span class="headword">Baines <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hunt]</span>,  Sarah Jane <span class="st"> [Jennie]</span></span>  (1866&#150;1951), <span class="occ">suffragette and social reformer</span>, was born on 30 November 1866 in Birmingham, the daughter of James Edward Hunt, gun maker, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. She started work in a Birmingham small arms factory aged eleven and at fourteen was assisting her parents in Salvation Army activities, rising to the rank of lieutenant. At twenty she was assigned to caring for women charged in court and was appointed evangelist to an independent working men's mission in Bolton. These experiences involved her in the temperance movement and, eventually, the broader sphere of feminism.<br>
<br>On 26 September 1888, at Bolton, Jennie Hunt married George Baines, a bootmaker; they had five children, three of whom survived childhood. Motherhood and work as a sewing machinist delayed full-time public activities but confirmed her commitment to social reform. She joined the Independent Labour Party, the unemployed committee, and the feeding of school children committee and stood, unsuccessfully, for the board of guardians in Stockport.<br>
<br>In October 1905, on reading of the arrest of the militant suffragettes Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney for assault, Jennie Baines joined their organization, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), as a voluntary worker. Appointed a paid organizer in February 1908, she organized disruption of meetings, held open-air rallies, and established new branches in the midlands and north. Though slightly built, she possessed a &#145;deep, rich and powerful voice&#146; that projected conviction  (private information).<br>
<br>In November 1908 Jennie Baines was the first WSPU member to be tried by jury. Convicted of unlawful assembly outside the Coliseum in Leeds, she was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment on refusing to be bound over because she did &#145;not recognise the laws of this Court administered by men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 26 Nov 1908). Her release occasioned an elaborate reception in Trafalgar Square. In July 1912, using the alias Lizzie Baker, she assisted Mary Leigh and Gladys Evans in their attempt to burn down the Theatre Royal in Dublin the night before the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, was scheduled to speak there. Sentenced to seven months' hard labour, she joined the others on hunger strike and was released after five days. On 8 July 1913, with her husband and son Wilfred, she allegedly attempted to bomb carriages in a Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway siding. Appearing at the assizes to deny involvement, Jennie was re-arrested under the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span> and consigned to Holloway prison, where she refused food and water and was released &#145;in a very serious condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, 15 Aug 1913). Though chorea had prevented force-feeding, WSPU leaders judged her health too frail to endure further imprisonment. Under the name Evans, Jennie and members of her family boarded the <i>Ballarat</i>, bound for Australia. George and Wilfred Baines were acquitted on 28 November and also embarked for Australia.<br>
<br>In Melbourne, the Baines joined the Victorian Socialist Party and the Labor Party but Jennie devoted her primary energies to the Women's Political Association and Women's Peace Army. With former suffragette Adela Pankhurst, she campaigned against conscription in 1916&#150;17 and in August 1917 led a series of violent protests by women against the surging cost of living. Though sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, both women were freed on appeal. Jennie was gaoled again in March 1919 for flying the prohibited red flag. Faced with six months behind bars, she resorted to hunger striking, reputedly the first prisoner in Australia to do so, and was released on the attorney-general's advice.<br>
<br>Jennie Baines helped found the Victorian branch of the Communist Party in 1920 but was expelled in 1925 and rejoined the Labor Party. In 1928 she was appointed special magistrate to the South Melbourne children's court. She maintained her fiery eloquence on the hustings, abandoning the public platform only months before her death from cancer in Port Melbourne on 20 February 1951. She was cremated, survived by her husband and three children. Jennie Baines distilled her evangelical devotion to socialism in these words: &#145;To fight for that which is better and nobler in this world is to live in the highest sense, but to submit and tolerate the evils which exist is to merely vegetate in the sewers of iniquity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Socialist</span>, 11 April 1919).<br>
