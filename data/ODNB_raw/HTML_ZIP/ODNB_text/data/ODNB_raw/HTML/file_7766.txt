<span class="headword">Doget <span class="st"> [Doket]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1501), <span class="occ">humanist scholar and college head</span>, was the nephew of Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1486), to whom Doget must have owed much of the considerable church patronage later bestowed on him. He was born in Sherborne, Dorset, and was probably educated in Bourchier's household before being admitted to Eton College as a king's scholar about 1447. From Eton he passed to King's College, Cambridge, in 1451, and became a fellow there in 1454. His humanist interests were no doubt encouraged at King's by the presence of a number of books from the library of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447), which gave King's the largest and most up-to-date collection of books in any of the Cambridge colleges. These books included the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> of Plato, and the <span class="italic">Republic</span> in the Latin translation of Pier Candido Decembrio  (now BL, Harley MS 1705).<br>
<br>In 1460 Doget took orders as a priest, and was granted leave to incept in theology in 1464. But in the same year he left Cambridge for Padua, the first of a number of King's fellows to follow this route. However, he was swindled out of more than &pound;50, intended to support him in Padua, by a London shearman named James Fynde, and had to leave, subsequently migrating to Bologna, where he studied canon law and earned his doctorate in 1469. He returned to Cambridge and continued his collection of benefices, which had begun with his appointment as archdeacon of Chichester in 1463. Papal dispensation enabled him to become a prebendary at Lincoln, Salisbury, and Southwell; to which were added by papal provision in 1479 canonries at Cambrai, St Omer, and St Mary's, Antwerp. He was also rector of Havant and Odiham, Hampshire, Eastbourne, Sussex, and Winterbourne Zelstone, Dorset, and became chancellor of Salisbury (1486) and Lichfield (1489) and master of Trinity College, Arundel (1499).<br>
<br>Doget was prolocutor of the clergy in the convocation of Canterbury in 1473, and was entrusted with important diplomatic duties in 1479&#150;80. He was sent to Rome to help arrange a peace between Pope Sixtus IV (<i>r</i>. 1471&#150;84) and Florence in 1479, dealing also with the princes of Sicily and Hungary. He was then appointed to an embassy to the king of Denmark. The standing he had attained at court was not affected either by the death of Edward IV, or by that of Richard III, whose domestic chaplain Doget had become in 1483. It was Henry VII who presented him to the provostship of his old college in 1499. At his death he bequeathed all his books on canon law and theology to King's, while also making bequests to the poor in the many parishes with which he was connected. His prosperity had taken a sad blow in 1491, when the fire that had destroyed his rectory house and outbuildings at Eastbourne cost him &pound;600, so he claimed. John Doget's will is dated 4 March 1501. He died the following month, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>Doget's principal claim to fame lies in his authorship of <span class="italic">Examinatorium in Phaedonem Platonis</span>, the first philosophical work by an English humanist. Dedicated to Cardinal Bourchier, to whom it must have been presented between 1473, when the latter became a cardinal, and his death in 1486, it survives in the British Library as Add. MS 10344. The script is italic and is probably that of Doget himself. But the parchment and illuminated vine-stem initials are English. The text of the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> on which Doget comments is the translation of Leonardo Bruni. As Roberto Weiss has pointed out in the commentary, &#145;his aim appears to have been an interpretation of some of Plato's passages as Christian maxims. Because of this he deals principally with an explanation of obscure passages in the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span>, which are presented so as to emphasize their common points with Christian doctrine&#146;  (Weiss, 166). The Neoplatonic texts cited by Doget, which include Marsilio Ficino's Latin version of the <span class="italic">Pimander</span>, or <span class="italic">Poemander</span>, of Hermes Trismegistus, are seen through the prism of Christian apologetics, and the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> was no doubt chosen in the first place as a vehicle for his commentary because it could be presented as a mythologized version of Christian doctrine. Doget's manuscript was later purchased by another humanist, Robert Sherborn, bishop of Chichester (<i>d</i>. 1536).<br>
