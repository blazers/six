<span class="headword">Puckle,  James</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1667, <em>d.</em> 1724), <span class="occ">writer and inventor</span>, was the son of James Puckle (<i>bap</i>. 1633, <i>d</i>. 1690), a merchant trading with Amsterdam, whose brother Thomas (1638&#150;1724), a London merchant, took out patents in 1693 for plastic wood and for a screw-wheel device for lifting heavy weights, thus perhaps encouraging his nephew's bent for invention. His mother's name is unknown and nothing is known of the younger James Puckle's life until he was married to Mary Francis at St Vedast, Foster Lane, on 22 January 1688. They had at least eight children before Mary died at some time between 1702 and 1714.<br>
<br>By 16 June 1690, when he obtained letters of administration for the estate of his father, who had died a widower overseas, Puckle was a notary public in partnership with one Jenkins in Pope's Head Alley, Cornhill. Puckle was also a stockjobber. Between 1696 and 1700 he published three pamphlets demonstrating the importance of the English fishing industry and advocating the purchase of shares in the company of the Royal Fishery of England (incorporated 1676), which it seems he was selling on commission. About 1707 he attempted to float a joint-stock company to be called &#145;The Merchant Adventurers of Great Britain&#146; which would trade on the Pacific coast of South America, and which sank with little trace.<br>
<br>In 1711 Puckle published <span class="italic">The Club</span>, a series of prose dialogues in which a young man describes members of his club to his father, who follows each description with appropriate moralisms. This device provides an alphabetical sequence of Theophrastian characters, from Antiquary and Buffoon to Youth and Zany. <span class="italic">The Club</span> was dedicated to two London tobacco importers, Micajah Perry and Richard Perry, and to the memory of a third, Thomas Lane, who had married Puckle's cousin Mary. Its third edition (1713) included a portrait of Puckle engraved by George Vertue after J. B. Closterman.<br>
<br>On 21 February 1715 Puckle was married at New Brentford to Elizabeth Fownes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cabell (<i>b</i>. 1675), widow of Richard Fownes, apothecary. Puckle and his new wife lived in the parish of St Stephen, Coleman Street, and had no children. There was apparently a family quarrel because Puckle signed a will on 30 June 1715 leaving 1<i>s</i>. to each of the four surviving children, aged thirteen to twenty-five, of his first marriage. The rest of his estate went to his new wife, who was named sole executrix.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1718 Puckle took out a patent for a portable breech-loading machine-gun that could be swivelled and elevated on a collapsible tripod, while its six-chambered breech could be turned by hand and replaced by others which enabled it to fire grenades, or either round or square bullets according to whether the enemy was Christian or Turk. Puckle's flotation of a joint-stock company to market this invention was satirized (along with many other &#145;bubbles&#146;) in prints and on playing cards. Prints and playing cards at this time also satirized the Royal Fishery. Undeterred, Puckle invented a patent sword, which, he wrote to James, first Earl Stanhope, on 11 April 1720, &#145;was worth a victory to the army first has it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 35/21/10). Though the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> on 31 March 1722 reported a successful trial of the machine-gun, asserting that &#145;one man discharged it 63 times in seven minutes&#146; despite continuous rain, though two of Puckle's guns were included in the armament of the second duke of Montagu's disastrous expedition to St Lucia that year, and though shares offered at &pound;4 rose at one point to &pound;8, the satirists were correct in saying that &#145;Puckle's Machine&#146; was dangerous only to investors. More reliably, Puckle revised <span class="italic">The Club</span>, now subtitled <i>a grey-cap for a green-head</i>, for a subscription edition in 1723, with a re-engraving of the Closterman portrait by J. Cole.<br>
<br>Puckle was interred in the burial-ground of St Stephen, Coleman Street, on 26 July 1724, the day after his contentious will was proved. <span class="italic">The Club</span> was reprinted in London, Dublin, and Philadelphia several times between 1733 and 1795, and came to wider notice in 1817 when it was republished with wood-engravings by John Thurston, John Thompson, and others, and became one of the works that significantly raised the prestige of wood-engraving in the early nineteenth century. The last reprint of the illustrated edition appeared in 1900 with an introduction by Austin Dobson, shortly after Sidney Lee observed that <span class="italic">The Club's</span> &#145;long lease of popularity seems to exceed its literary merits&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). There is a Puckle machine-gun in the Royal Armouries, Leeds.<br>
