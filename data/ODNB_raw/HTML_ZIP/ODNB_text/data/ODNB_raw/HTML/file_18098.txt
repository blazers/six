<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marryat,  Thomas</span>  (1730&#150;1792), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in London, was descended from a Huguenot family and was educated for the Presbyterian ministry. He possessed great natural talents, a brilliant memory, and a love for literature. His appearance was, to say the least, plain, but his wit, though frequently coarse, was irresistible. From 1747 until 1749 he belonged to a poetical club which met at the Robin Hood, Butcher Row, the Strand, every Wednesday at five in the afternoon, and seldom parted until five the next morning. Among its members were Dr Richard Brookes, Moses Browne, Stephen Duck, Martin Madan, and Thomas Madox. Each member brought a piece of poetry, which was corrected and, if approved, thrown into the treasury from which the wants of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and other periodicals were supplied. A supper and trials of wit followed; Marryat, whom Brookes nicknamed &#145;Sal Volatile&#146;, frequently kept the table amused, though he was never known to laugh himself.<br>
<br>In 1754 Marryat was ordained a minister at Southwold, Suffolk. He married Sarah, the daughter of John Davy of Southwold; their first son, Joseph, father of the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18097/', "Frederick Marryat")</script>, was born there on 8 October 1757. Marryat published his <span class="italic">Medical Aphorisms</span> in 1756 or 1757. This was followed by his <span class="italic">Therapeutics, a New Practice of Physic</span>, published in Latin in 1758. It was re-titled <span class="italic">The Art of Healing</span> for a pocket edition. Marryat gave up the ministry in 1760, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he studied medicine at Edinburgh University. It is said that for a while he sought practice in London, and that in 1762 he made a tour of continental medical schools, and subsequently visited America, obtaining practice where he could.<br>
<br>On his return to the British Isles in 1766 Marryat resided for several years in co. Antrim and the northern parts of Ireland. Here he set aside two hours every day to non-paying patients, allowing him to test his medicines on them; in this he tended to administer enormous doses of drastic medicines regardless of the patient's constitution. For dysentery his favourite prescription was paper boiled in milk. The poor, however, maintained a high regard for his skills as a doctor. In February 1774 Marryat moved to Shrewsbury, but finally settled in Bristol about 1785. Here he delivered a course of lectures on therapeutics which was well attended. He also published a book called <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Masons</span> (1790), a work that contained views which managed to offend even his best friends. Although his good fortune in restoring to health some patients who had been given up by other doctors gained him a reputation that quickly enabled him to achieve a good lifestyle, his improvident habits eventually reduced him to poverty. When Marryat found his friends deserting him, he fixed a note on the window of The Bush coffee-room, enquiring &#145;if any one remembered that there was such a person as Thomas Marryat&#146; and reminding them that he &#145;still lived, or rather existed, in Horfield Road&#146;  (Marryat, xi). Despite his distress, however, he persistently refused assistance from his relatives. In 1791 he published a new edition of his <span class="italic">Sentimental Fables for the Ladies</span>. Dedicated to Hannah More they had originally been published in Ireland.<br>
<br>Marryat's manners were disagreeably blunt, and towards the end of his life he became morose; but he is represented as a man of integrity and of genuine kindness, especially to the poor. He died in Bristol on 29 May 1792, and was buried in the ground belonging to the Presbyterian chapel in Lewin's Mead, Brunswick Square, Bristol.<br>
