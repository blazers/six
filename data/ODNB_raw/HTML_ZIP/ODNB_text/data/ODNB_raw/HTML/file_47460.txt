<span class="headword">Chapman,  Edward</span>  (1804&#150;1880), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was one of the nine children in a family of six sons and three daughters of Thomas Chapman (1771&#150;1833), a Richmond solicitor. In 1830 he went into business with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60803/', "William Hall (1800&#150;1847)")</script> as a bookseller and small publisher, leasing double-windowed premises at 186 Strand, London. On 6 June 1830 they published the first number of a sixpenny compendium, <span class="italic">Chat of the Week</span>; over the next five years they ventured cautiously into other, often joint, ventures. One evening in December 1833 a customer purchased a copy of the new <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> from Hall; the unremarkable event had important consequences for the firm two years later, when they were looking for a writer to supply text accompanying comic plates by the artist Robert Seymour. Having ascertained from Charles Whitehead, recently appointed editor of their new monthly <span class="italic">Library of Fiction</span>, the real name of Boz, the author of some admired sketches published in various London periodicals, they decided to ask Charles Dickens to pen the copy. When William Hall called upon Dickens on 10 February 1836, the author recognized the bookseller from their former transaction, and feeling that the coincidence was a sign, Dickens agreed to the general terms of Hall's proposal for <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span>. Of the many changes made in the course of publishing the novel, Chapman proudly took credit for the one that transformed the hero from the &#145;long, thin man&#146; Seymour had originally drawn to &#145;a fat old beau&#146; like a Richmond friend of Chapman &#145;who would wear, in spite of the ladies' protests, drab tights and black gaiters&#146;  (Forster, 1.91). From that point, Dickens was associated with, and to a large extent made the fortune of, Chapman and Hall, even though he broke with the firm in so far as new fiction was concerned in 1844, and did not return fully until 1859.<br>
<br>Dickens became very friendly with Chapman's family, including his eldest brother Thomas (1800&#150;1895), surveyor and land agent, and his sisters. He had more difficulty getting on with another brother, William (1802&#150;1874), a solicitor in Richmond who served as legal counsel for the firm and in August 1841 drafted terms for Dickens's next serial so stringent and demeaning that Dickens threatened to quit. The Dickenses were also friends with &#145;Little Hall and his little wife&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.358), on whose wedding Dickens based &#145;The Nice Little Couple&#146; in <span class="italic">Sketches of Young Couples</span> (1840). The bachelor friend who enviously observes the happiness of the newly-weds &#145;was Edward Chapman himself&#146;, according to Arthur Waugh  (Waugh, 6). Shortly afterwards, while visiting his uncle, Michael Chapman, in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Chapman saw over the garden wall the younger daughter of the next-door neighbour, a strict Quaker family, and fell in love with her. When communication was forbidden by her parents and elders of the society, Chapman bored a hole through an upstairs wall and into the neighbours' spare room through which he passed notes and whispers. Eventually Mary Whiting (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1820), spirited enough to defy authority, was read out of the society. She then travelled to a brother's house in Leeds, where she and Chapman were married on 22 September 1841. A year later the couple moved into a commodious house standing back from the Old Brompton Road, which they called Clareville Cottage and where they enjoyed a happy marriage. They had at least two daughters, Meta and Florence.<br>
<br>By the end of its run in November 1837, <span class="italic">Pickwick</span> was a triumphant financial as well as literary success. Recycling their capital monthly, Chapman and Hall made &pound;14,000 from a novel that, had it been published in three volumes, might have yielded some hundreds. Dickens, whose remuneration was increased often during the serial run, was so pleased by the generous nature of his publishers that he playfully nominated them &#145;my periodical publishers, until I am advertised in the daily papers, as having been compressed into my last edition&#151;one volume, boards, with brass plates&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.189). It was not easy being Dickens's publisher during his phenomenally swift rise, however. John Forster, a prosperous lawyer and literary critic, became the firm's literary adviser, as well as Dickens's, and managed, with Edward Chapman's good-natured financial collaboration, to buy out the projects Dickens had contracted with other publishers. Eventually the debts incurred by the firm on Dickens's behalf had to be repaid; Hall, the brisk businessman, hinted to Dickens in June 1843 that a reimbursement clause in the agreement of 7 September 1841 for <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> (1843&#150;4) might have to be invoked. Furious, Dickens turned in future to his printers, Bradbury and Evans. However, since Chapman and Hall shared in the copyrights of most of Dickens's previous books, they continued to sell his early works and, from 1847, collected editions.<br>
<br>Chapman often tended to matters involving the illustrations and proofs. He was meditative, studious, and literary. His daughter described him as &#145;truth and sincerity and very broad in judgement and his views&#146;; she did not, however, think he was &#145;a business man&#146;  (Waugh, facs. facing p. 4). In financial matters he vacillated between impulsive generosity and unsustained efforts at holding to contractual obligations. He steered the firm into two channels, one circulating sound literature and the other capitalizing on popular taste. William Makepeace Thackeray arrived at the door in 1840, contributed ten articles to the <span class="italic">Foreign and Quarterly Review</span> in the two years 1842&#150;4 after Chapman and Hall bought it from Black and Armstrong (Houghton), published with them his travel and Christmas books, and remained friendly with Edward and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5116/', "Frederic Chapman (1823&#150;1895)")</script> after he left the firm in 1850. But his major serial fictions were issued by Bradbury and Evans, who also published <span class="italic">Punch</span>, to which Thackeray was contributing. In 1843 Forster brought Thomas Carlyle to the Strand. He was not at first a valuable addition and grumbled about his &#145;hard-fisted, cautious bibliographer&#146;  (Waugh, 119), but his reputation and sales rose markedly from the 1850s. Other mid-century authors Chapman published included William Harrison Ainsworth, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Arthur Hugh Clough, William Allingham, and Elizabeth Gaskell. Charles Lever came at the height of his career in 1844; Dickens served as intermediary between Lever in Italy and the firm in the 1860s, when Lever's popularity plummeted. Chapman and his wife sustained cordial relations not only with George Henry Lewes's legitimate family, but also with George Eliot, whom Mary Chapman addressed as &#145;Mrs. Evans Lewes&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Eliot Letters</span>, 3.195&#150;6).<br>
<br>Chapman's daughter Meta (<i>b</i>. 1842), later Mrs Gaye, recalled in her eighty-eighth year that she &#145;used to wonder what he did at the office as when ever Mama took me to 193 Piccadilly, Papa was standing with his back to the fire&#146;  (Waugh, facs. facing p. 4). So he was standing one day in the spring of 1858, in the premises to which the firm had moved six years previously, when Anthony Trollope stormed in, saying what he had to say to Chapman<blockquote>in a quick torrent of words &hellip; Looking at me as he might have done at a highway robber who had stopped him on Hounslow Heath &hellip; I remember that he held the poker in his hand all the time that I was with him;&#151;but in truth, even though he had declined to buy the book [<span class="italic">Doctor Thorne</span>], there would have been no danger. (Trollope, 99)</blockquote>From that point on, the firm issued thirty-two of Trollope's titles, and in 1869 Trollope paid &pound;10,000 for a third interest in the firm for his son Henry Merivale Trollope, who stayed in the partnership for about three years.<br>
<br>Between 1847, when Hall suddenly died, and 1864, when Chapman retired, his cousin and Frederic Chapman rose to the status of partner. The firm enjoyed some good years. The expansion of railways, circulating libraries, and middle-class leisure improved book sales; Dickens's full-scale return to Chapman and Hall in 1859 afforded Frederic an opportunity to issue a new Dickens periodical, <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, and new serial fictions, and to reissue in new formats older titles and multiple collected editions&#151;all of which eventually turned a profit; and Dickens's renewed association brought to Chapman and Hall rising authors such as Wilkie Collins. When Forster retired in autumn 1860, he was replaced by George Meredith, who served as a conscientious and &#145;fastidious&#146; literary adviser for more than thirty years  (Waugh, 139&#150;40). While Meredith turned down a few hugely popular works, he looked after the standards of quality and soundness that Chapman had established.<br>
<br>In retirement Chapman travelled throughout Europe for nearly a decade. Poor health brought him back to the home he had built in Tunbridge Wells. On 20 February 1880 he died at Elm Lodge in Hitchin, the town where some four decades earlier he had wooed and won his bride.<br>
