<span class="headword">Atkyns, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1621, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and baptized there on 29 April 1621, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/862/', "Sir Edward Atkyns (1587&#150;1669)")</script>, a baron of the exchequer during the interregnum, and the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/863/', "Sir Edward Atkyns (1630/31&#150;1698)")</script>, who preceded Sir Robert as chief baron. His mother, Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1644), was the daughter of Sir Thomas Dacres of St Andrew-le-Mott.<h2>
<a name="Earlylegalandpoliticalcareer"></a>Early legal and political career</h2>After attending school at Hertford, Atkyns was admitted a pensioner at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on 2 May 1637. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 8 October 1638 and was called to the bar in 1645. His first marriage was to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1681), daughter of Sir George Clerk, of Watford, Northamptonshire; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/867/', "Robert Atkyns (bap. 1647, d. 1711)")</script> was their son. With his second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Dacres and great-niece of his mother, he had a daughter, Anne, who became the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/864/', "John Tracy Atkyns (1706&#150;1773)")</script>. During the interregnum Atkyns earned considerable success as an advocate, and he became a bencher in 1661 and a reader in 1664. In 1663 he received a masters degree from Oxford. He entered political life in 1656 when he was elected to the Commons to represent Carmarthen, and in 1659 he sat in Richard Cromwell's parliament as a member for Evesham, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>Despite his service to the Cromwells, Atkyns was selected as one of the sixty-eight men whom Charles II created knights of the Bath at the Restoration. In 1661 he became recorder of Bristol and, at the king's marriage, solicitor-general to the queen. Sitting in the Cavalier Parliament for East Looe in Cornwall he delivered more than fifty speeches and served on numerous committees, including the one that successfully opposed Charles II's early efforts to dispense with the statutes enjoining religious conformity. Nevertheless, Atkyns continued to enjoy the favour of the king, which, along with his successful law practice, enabled him to prosper. In 1665 Atkyns served as a royal commissioner to collect the extra tax money that parliament mandated for the Dutch war, and in 1671 he became receiver-general of all rates and duties levied by parliament on legal proceedings, from which he earned &pound;1000 in two years. In May 1673 a fellow traveller in the Loire valley described him as accompanied by &#145;his lady, a coach and six horses, a pack of hounds and half a dozen stable horses&#146;  (Landon, 49). He earned a reputation as &#145;a very learned man&#146; who was second only to Sir Matthew Hale in legal erudition. But he could also be &#145;very hot and indiscreet&#146;  (H. C. Foxcroft, <span class="italic">A Supplement to Burnet's &#145;History of my Own Time&#146;</span>, 1902, 122), probably a reference to his bold and outspoken opposition to Charles II and James II.<br>
<br>Atkyns's legal talents continued to serve him well throughout the period of the Restoration. In 1672 he attained the rank of serjeant-at-law and was appointed a justice of common pleas, perhaps in an attempt to remove him from the lower house, where he was acquiring a reputation as something of an anti-court troublemaker. In addition to opposing Charles II's use of the dispensing power, he openly objected to what he considered to be royal attacks on the independence of parliament. His political beliefs played a role in the case of Sir Samuel Barnardiston, an opponent of the court who had been elected to the Commons in Suffolk. The sheriff of Suffolk, Sir William Soame, sent in a double return on the ground that many of Barnardiston's supporters, especially dissenters, were not forty-shilling freeholders. In February 1674 the House of Commons voted to seat Barnardiston, who then sued Soame in king's bench for damages on the ground that Soame's actions had prevented him from taking his seat for a year. Although Chief Justice Matthew Hale decided in Barnardiston's favour, the exchequer chamber reversed Hale's judgment. One of two dissenters in the exchequer, Atkyns objected to the verdict on the ground that the common-law courts could, and indeed should, compensate Barnardiston for the damages he had incurred. But even more harmful than the private wrong, Atkyns continued, was the public wrong, which he described as &#145;a design to model the parliament to the humour of the court&#146;  (R. Atkyns, <span class="italic">Parliamentary and Political Tracts</span>, 1734, 137). After the revolution of 1688 the case figured in the enactment of statutes 7 &amp; 8 Wm. III c. 7, which made it illegal for a sheriff to make a double return in elections to the Commons. In June 1676 Atkyns's apparent support of the City of London's petition calling for a new parliament almost led to his removal from the bench.<br>
<br>The exclusion crisis exacerbated Atkyns's fear of the royal court and the court's fear of him. By 1680 his close connections to William, Lord Russell, and like-minded Englishmen led the government to press for his dismissal from the bench, and early in 1680 he resigned. Atkyns himself attributed his ouster to Sir William Scroggs, chief justice of king's bench, and Sir Francis North, chief justice of common pleas. In fact, he had clashed with North over several cases, including North's naming of a protonotary. Although this right belonged to the chief justice, Atkyns insisted that the entire court be consulted. An altercation ensued in court, with North arguing &#145;that he knows here was no republic&#146; and Atkyns responding &#145;no, nor a monarchy&#146;  (R. North, <span class="italic">The Lives of the Right Hon. Francis North &hellip;</span>, 1826, 387&#150;91). Testifying to the House of Commons in April 1689, Atkyns further explained that North and Scroggs had objected to his attacks on parliamentary pensions, his opposition to Charles II's policy of censoring books without parliamentary approval, and his support of the right of the people to petition peacefully. A man of his convictions, Atkyns declined a royal offer of &pound;500 for having attended &#145;diligently in parliament&#146;, replying &#145;I will not accept anything for my attendance&#146;. He added that &#145;those who took pensions were not fit to be sent up to parliament again&#146; (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 5.307&#150;8; A. Grey, <span class="italic">Debates of the House of Commons, 1667 to 1694</span>, 1763, 9.307&#150;9).<br>
<br>The political climate of the early 1680s led Atkyns to retire to Lower Swell near Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, but not for long. Friends pressured him to stand for Bristol in the third Exclusion Parliament, which election he and Sir John Knight lost to Charles II's supporters Sir Richard Hart and Sir Thomas Earle. Although determined to carry on the fight before the Commons committee on elections and privileges, Atkyns and Knight once again met defeat when Charles II dissolved the Oxford parliament before the lower house could consider their case.<br>
<br>Atkyns soon encountered still another political setback. In September 1681, as the government proceeded with the remodelling of the corporations, the citizens of Bristol elected tories to the offices of mayor and sheriff. Soon the corporation indicted Atkyns, along with several other Bristol aldermen, for &#145;most riotously&#146; creating an alderman without the assent of the mayor, who was his former opponent Richard Hart. Convicted at the assizes, Atkyns exploited his legal connections by appealing to king's bench, where in November 1682 the justices overturned the assize verdict after allowing him to plead his own case while appearing at the front of the court in his robes. Upon learning that the Bristol tories planned another indictment Atkyns resigned the recordership, which had been the purpose of his opponents' attacks all along. He insisted, however, on several conditions: first, that he receive his arrears of salary; second, that Charles II's government order that the corporation drop all further attempts to proceed against him and his friend Sir John Knight. The city agreed, and in January 1683 Atkyns was replaced by Sir John Churchill, attorney-general to the duke of York and a cousin of the future duke of Marlborough.<br>
<br>Once again Atkyns retreated to Lower Swell, only to be called in June 1683 to aid in the defence of Lord Russell, whom the government charged with treason after the discovery of the Rye House plot. Although he could not officially serve as counsel, Atkyns agreed to help Russell's lawyers Henry Pollexfen and John Holt in their efforts. He entered the fray despite the fact that in the wake of the plot's discovery local officials searched his house and removed all weapons, even the sword with which he had been knighted at the Restoration (it was returned to him in 1689). In letters to Russell's family and friends Atkyns joined Pollexfen and Holt in arguing against Russell's conviction on the ground that not all of the jurors were forty-shilling freeholders or possessed of &pound;100 in goods. Russell was executed on 21 June 1683, too quickly for an appeal to be filed. Shortly before he laid his head on the block he handed the sheriff a document in which he presented an argument that had probably come from Atkyns, namely that, under statute 2 Edward III c. 2, Russell's mere presence when insurrection was being plotted made him guilty of misprision of treason, not treason itself. Atkyns later published some of these letters along with more extensive arguments in two tracts written in reply to the tory Sir Bartholomew Shower's works upholding the verdict against Russell  (R. Atkyns, <span class="italic">Parliamentary and Political Tracts</span>, 1734).<h2>
<a name="Atkynsandtherevolutionof1688"></a>Atkyns and the revolution of 1688</h2>Atkyns's opposition to the Stuart monarchy continued under James II, whose policies caused him to hone and more fully articulate his political beliefs. At issue for him and the political nation at large was the new king's Catholicizing policy which would soon unite the country against him and lead to his overthrow at the revolution. In order to place his coreligionists in high governmental and military positions, James had to defeat the numerous statutes enjoining religious conformity, including the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. Not content to dispense with these laws on an individual basis, he suspended them wholesale and, in Atkyns's view, thereby imperilled not only the established church but the English constitution itself. More specifically, Atkyns believed that because statutes were made by king and parliament, they must be defeated by the same authority and not by the king alone. Indeed, the dispensing power constituted no part of the royal prerogative, having begun in the reign of Henry III. This followed from the fact that the thirteenth century lay well within the time of legal memory, which early modern common lawyers took to be 3 September 1189, the date of Richard I's coronation. Put differently, kings possessed no prescriptive right to dispense.<br>
<br>At first glance Atkyns's position regarding the royal dispensing power is puzzling, for in denying the king's right to set aside statutes he turned his back on centuries of legal learning. As even the most cursory examination of medieval and early modern records demonstrates, before 1660 monarchs had freely exercised the dispensing power and its twin the suspending power (which was simply the dispensing power writ large) without serious dissent. Indeed, generations of lawyers and political theorists viewed the right as an essential and inseparable prerogative of the crown.<br>
<br>Atkyns's disregard of medieval and early modern legal theory and practice can be explained by an examination of the changing ideological climate in the late seventeenth century. According to some modern scholars (Weston and Greenberg, <span class="italic">Subjects and Sovereigns</span>) the years following the restoration of Charles II saw the waning of one persuasive political ideology and the growing acceptance of another. The first was the &#145;order&#146; or divine right theory of kingship in which the dispensing power played a central role; the second, favoured by Atkyns and his fellow whigs, was the radical ancient constitutionalist ideology to which the order theory was inimical. First fully articulated during the civil wars of the 1640s by writers such as William Prynne, the theory of the radical ancient constitution held that while government in general was from God, the particular form proceeded from the people. In ancient times the English made a contract with their ruler according to which they gave him their allegiance in return for his promise to govern according to the laws made by king and people. The ruler who broke this original agreement deposed himself and left his subjects free to replace him with a king more to their liking. Importantly, parliamentarians and whigs such as Atkyns further argued that this particular form of government was in place at least as early as the Saxon period and had weathered potential breaks in continuity such as the Norman conquest.<br>
<br>According to modern scholarship (Greenberg, &#145;The Confessor's laws&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Radical Face of the Ancient Constitution</span>), this theory of government rested on several medieval sources that dissidents such as Atkyns held dear, in particular, the <span class="italic">Modus tenendi parliamentum</span>, the <span class="italic">Mirror of Justices</span>, and the so-called laws of St Edward the Confessor. Although actually manufactured in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, all three purported to date from Saxon England, and all three told how Saxon institutions, in particular parliament and the common law, survived the conquest intact.<br>
<br>Atkyns and his like-minded colleagues also drew inspiration from Charles I's notorious <span class="italic">Answer to the Nineteen Propositions</span> (1642), in which the king had fatefully sanctioned the notion of co-ordination and coevality among the legally sovereign estates of king, Lords, and Commons. The ineluctable conclusion of all such theorizing was that because law was made by three co-ordinate estates in ancient times, so it must now be dispensed with by the same authority. In other words, by the late seventeenth century the acceptance of radical ancient constitutionalism among anti-royalists doomed the exercise of the royal dispensing power.<h2>
<a name="AtkynsscareerinthereignofWilliamandMary"></a>Atkyns's career in the reign of William and Mary</h2>This version of law, politics, and history Atkyns fully developed in several tracts written in support of William and Mary. Moved by James II's policies and their high tory defence, which took the form of the order theory of kingship, Atkyns argued the now-standard ancient constitutionalist line: according to the <span class="italic">Modus</span>, the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, and St Edward's laws, the governmental contract vested legal sovereignty in king, Lords, and Commons. So England had been continuously ruled since long before the Norman conquest. In his words, &#145;We ourselves of the present age chose our common law, and consented to the most ancient acts of parliament, for we lived in our ancestors one thousand years ago, and those ancestors are still living in us&#146;. This meant in turn that the community had a hand in making the law, which was the act of the whole body politic, the rule by which the king governed and the subject obeyed. Therefore, Atkyns concluded, James II possessed no power to set aside statutes, since &#145;none but the law-maker can dispense with the law, not he that hath but a share in the legislature&#146;&#151;and this by &#145;grant from the people&#146;. That is, the power to dispense rested in king and parliament, not the king alone. &#145;The king, the nobles and the commons of the realm present in parliament&#146; could dispense whenever they judged it &#145;meet and convenient for the wealth of the realm&#146; (<span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Power of Dispensing with Penal Statutes</span>, 1689, 5&#150;7; &#145;A postscript: being some animadversions upon a book writ by Sir Edward Herbert&#146;, in <span class="italic">State trials</span>, 11.1269; <span class="italic">The Power and Jurisdiction of Parliament; and the Antiquity of the House of Commons Asserted</span>, 1689, 17&#150;18, 25, 27, 59).<br>
<br>Enjoying the good will of William and Mary, Atkyns was appointed lord chief baron of the exchequer (1689&#150;94) and speaker of the House of Lords (1689&#150;93). In these positions he took part in the debates concerning the revolution settlement. His radical ancient constitutionalist views proved particularly valuable when the upper house discussed the Commons' declaration of 28 January 1689. One of the points at issue was the declaration's use of the term &#145;original contract&#146; to describe the nature of government and the relationship between king and subject. Such language provoked extended debate, especially among those lords who worried that it conjured up visions of rebellion. Called upon to give advice to the upper house, Atkyns noted that legal treatises shed no light on the subject. However, he suggested that the phrase must refer &#145;to the first original of government&#146;. Indeed, kings never ruled without an agreement with their people, which explained how England came to be a &#145;limited monarchy&#146; (<span class="italic">House of Lords MSS</span>, 2.15; Weston and Greenberg, 255&#150;6).<br>
<br>Although the ensuing compromise between the two houses dropped references to an original contract, the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> itself enshrined Atkyns's views of English law and government. Thus its opening clauses abolished the suspending power outright and the dispensing power &#145;as it hath been assumed and exercised of late&#146;. Admittedly the qualified language concerning the dispensing power, which the Lords had added (perhaps with Atkyns's counsel), might seem to indicate that they favoured some saving of the royal discretionary authority. But in fact the upper house restricted its exercise only to two circumstances: first, when a statute itself permitted dispensation; and second, if the measure fell within a certain category of statutes that the Convention Parliament provided for at the revolution&#151;a statute which, however, never passed the two houses. So in the end Atkyns's opinions of kingship, which reflected that of the whigs in general, prevailed. Henceforth, the dispensing power would be exercised in accordance with the will of a sovereign parliament, if at all.<br>
<br>With the Commons' acceptance of this final wording on 25 November 1689, the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> had achieved its final form, and Atkyns's view of the English constitution now constituted the law of the land. Indeed, his entire description of the workings of the English government and its long history summed up the political conclusions of radical ancient constitutionalists from the civil wars down to the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>Atkyns retired from public life in 1694, retreating to his manor of Saperton near Cirencester, Gloucestershire. His last public act was to write two works in which he argued for the right of the common-law courts as against the encroachments of the House of Lords and the chancery (<span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Jurisdiction of the Chancery in Causes of Equity</span>, 1695; <span class="italic">A Treatise of the True and Ancient Jurisdiction of the House of Peers</span>, 1699). He died at Saperton Hall on 18 February 1710 &#145;after half an hour's indisposition&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 25). A monument to him as well as to his younger brother, Edward, and his father stands in Westminster Abbey.<br>
