<span class="headword">Laroon,  Marcellus, the younger</span>  (1679&#150;1772), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 2 April 1679 in London, the second son of the painter <a href="#cosubject_16073">Marcellus Laroon the elder [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Elizabeth Keene. Though baptized Marcellus Lauron, he always used the name Laroon. He was trained with his brothers by his father as a painter, but also learned fencing, dancing, French, and music.<br>
<br>At eighteen, in 1697, Laroon attended the peace conference at Rijswijk (Ryswick) in Holland as a page before visiting Venice with Charles Montagu, fourth earl of Manchester. After returning to London in 1698, Laroon worked briefly with his father before embarking on a career as an independent painter. He was soon obliged to find other work, as a singer for Colley Cibber at the Drury Lane Theatre, where he remained until 1706.<br>
<br>In 1707 Laroon joined the 1st regiment of foot guards, beginning an army career described in his autobiography (which tells little of his artistic life). His earliest attributed drawings, for example, <span class="italic">A Market Tent in Camp: Soldiers Making Merry</span> (1707; Courtauld Inst.), record army life in Flanders. On campaign in Spain in 1709&#150;11, Laroon was imprisoned. Ransomed after two years, he resumed civilian life (on half pay) in Covent Garden; he worked at Kneller's academy of painting from 1712 to 1715, and socialized with the painter Samuel Scott at the Rose and Crown Club. In 1715 Laroon returned to soldiering, and he served in Scotland before retiring from the army, aged fifty-three, on a captain's full pay, free from reliance on art commissions.<br>
<br>Laroon interpreted eighteenth-century English life with sympathetic humour and refinement in paintings and drawings. Most of his conversation pieces, like <span class="italic">The Dinner Party</span>, given by Laroon to George I (1725; Royal Collection), resemble scenes from plays, often incorporating a few apparent portraits and details such as Venetian furniture and music-making which reflect Laroon's personal interests and experience. The actions of minor figures often serve as commentaries on the central action. For example, in <span class="italic">A Nobleman's Lev&eacute;e</span> (<i>c</i>.1740; priv. coll.), the boy grooming a dog in the foreground parodies the relationship between the nobleman and the valet tending his wig. Laroon's individualized treatment of servants and his gentle mockery of aristocratic pride may derive from his period as a page.<br>
<br>Laroon's works reveal his Franco-Netherlandish artistic heritage and his interest in contemporary French art, filtered through English cultural attitudes, as in <span class="italic">The Village Wedding</span> (1735; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Tavern Interior with Peasants</span> (1742; priv. coll.), which includes details reminiscent of works by Teniers and Watteau. The jolly server leaning forward at the left in <span class="italic">The Dinner Party</span> is a miniature version of a Dutch &#145;merry toper&#146;. The cello propped against a stool in <span class="italic">A Musical Assembly</span> (1720) is a quotation from Watteau. (Laroon, himself a cellist, was certainly familiar with musical instruments.)<br>
<br>Laroon's finished drawings include a group of &#145;music party&#146; scenes intended as gifts for friends. Into old age Laroon continued to compose lively crowd scenes. In his <span class="italic">A Fight</span> (1770; AM Oxf.); Laroon depicts a battle between rival serenading parties with the expertise of an army veteran.<br>
<br>Preliminary sketches survive for some of Laroon's finished drawings, but few for his paintings. He worked out details of individual figures on the final canvas, outlining them in brown on a greyish ground and filling them in with oil colour, which he increasingly used like watercolour wash. From the 1760s he relied on white highlights rather than chiaroscuro to create depth.<br>
<br>Laroon also collected art. His sale (17 March 1775) included works by Cuyp, Hobbema, Ostade, Kneller, Bril, Teniers, Van de Velde, and (allegedly) Watteau. According to Vertue, Laroon possessed portraits by Frans Hals of the portrait painter Thomas Wyck and his wife.<br>
<br>Laroon was high-spirited and good-humoured, judging from his writings, for example his farewell letter written on the eve of the battle of Schellenberg (Raines, 1996, 44; Weyerman, appx 4, p. 102), and from his challenge in 1729 to friends at London's Tavern Club who criticized his advice to Sir Robert Walpole on buying art. In old age, Laroon moved to Oxford. He died there on 1 June 1772 in the parish of St Mary Magdalen.<br>
<br>Laroon's father, <a name="cosubject_16073"></a><span class="headword">Marcellus Laroon the elder</span>  (1648/9&#150;1702), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at The Hague in the Netherlands, the son of Marcel Lauron, a French painter of portraits and landscapes. Lauron apprenticed his son to a history painter before taking him (after 1660) to London, where Laroon trained until about 1670 with &#145;La Zoon&#146; (perhaps Hendrick Sonnius, Lely's assistant), and with Balthazar Flesshier, a painter of seascapes and portraits. He then became a portrait painter in Yorkshire (where, he told George Vertue, he met Rembrandt at Hull). After returning to London, Laroon joined the Company of Painter&#150;Stainers in 1674. In 1675 he married Elizabeth Keene, daughter of Jeremiah Keen, a rich builder of Little Sutton, near Chiswick. Elizabeth's wealth probably enabled the Laroons to live from 1680 at 4 Bow Street, in fashionable Covent Garden. They had six children. Their three surviving sons (including Marcellus Laroon the younger) were trained by their father as painters, and received a liberal education.<br>
<br>Laroon's most famous works were his drawings of London street traders and entertainers. Examples are at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire. Engraved by different hands, these were published in 1687 as <span class="italic">The Cryes of the City of London Drawne after the Life</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Tempest's Cryes of London</span>, after its publisher Pierce Tempest). They inspired copies, children's books, and a set of Meissen porcelain figurines by Johann Kaendler (1706&#150;1775). The final edition from the original copperplates was printed in 1821. Laroon also provided twenty-four illustrations for <span class="italic">The Art of Defence</span> (1699), a book about fencing, and erotic engravings (with titles like <span class="italic">The Brothel</span> and <span class="italic">A Fryer's Civil Chastisement</span>), for sale in 1691 at Will's Coffee House, Bow Street. Vertue recorded a <span class="italic">Coronation Procession of William III and Mary II</span> by Laroon the elder.<br>
<br>Laroon's masterpiece was his <span class="italic">Charles II</span> (1684) for Christ's Hospital (it measured 15 feet by 10 feet). He also produced portraits of John, Lord Lovelace (1689; Wadham College, Oxford), William Savery (1690; City Art Gallery, Plymouth), and Caius Gabriel Cibber, the sculptor. His <span class="italic">Deliverance of Andromeda</span> was engraved by John Smith. A versatile painter, Laroon also worked as a copyist, notably of the Dutch architectural artist Bartholomeus van Bassen, and painted animals (including the lost <span class="italic">Spaniel</span> and <span class="italic">Sparrowhawk</span>), small conversation pieces, &#145;drolls&#146; (comic paintings), and &#145;fancy&#146; paintings. He excelled in drapery painting, and became a studio assistant to Kneller.<br>
<br>Laroon commemorated his combative personality in a lost self-portrait showing sword-fighting scars. (He appears unmarked in portrait prints by William Humphrey and G. P. Harding.) He died of consumption aged fifty-three on 11 March 1702 at Richmond, Surrey, and was buried there, bequeathing his art collection to his three sons.<br>
