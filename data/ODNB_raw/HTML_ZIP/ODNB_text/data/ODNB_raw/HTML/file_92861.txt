<span class="headword">Heller,  Erich</span>  (1911&#150;1990), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 27 March 1911 in Komotau, in what was then the German-speaking part of northern Bohemia, in Austria-Hungary, the son of Alfred Heller, a doctor, and his wife, Elsa. The family was of Jewish origin. He became a citizen of Czechoslovakia when that state was created after the First World War. After attending a German <i>Gymnasium</i>, he studied law, philosophy, and German literature at Charles University, Prague, from 1930 until 1935, when he graduated with a doctorate of law. He was then attached to a lawyer to train for the profession, but his interests were increasingly turning to German literature, on which he published a short work, mainly about Thomas Mann and Karl Kraus, in 1938. He was active in the Social Democratic Party, and involved himself in efforts to combat the Sudeten German nationalists. But the tide could not be held in check, and the Germans occupied Prague in March 1939.<br>
<br>Heller fled from Czecholovakia in the summer of 1939 and managed to get away to Poland. He never forgot how last-minute his escape was&#151;not least because his mother and a number of his family perished in concentration camps. He sailed out of Poland on one of the last boats to leave Gdynia, and docked in London on 26 August 1939. He spent the first months of wartime in a hostel for refugees in Epping Forest, and learnt English swiftly and well. On the strength of his early publication, he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to work on a PhD thesis on Thomas Mann, which he completed in 1948. His studies were interrupted by teaching appointments: from 1943 to 1945 he was assistant lecturer in German for the London School of Economics, which had been evacuated to Cambridge, and from 1945 to 1948 he was lecturer in German and director of studies in modern languages at Peterhouse. In June 1947 he was naturalized as a British citizen, and retained British nationality until his death.<br>
<br>After holding visiting lectureships in the universities of Hamburg, G&ouml;ttingen, and Bonn, Heller was in 1948 appointed head of the department of German at the University College of Swansea, in the University of Wales, subsequently becoming, in 1950, the first holder of its chair of German. He was eagerly sought after as guest lecturer in the United States&#151;at, for example, Brandeis, Yale, Brown, and Oberlin College. Finally, in 1960 he moved to the United States to take up a professorship of German at Northwestern University in Illinois; in 1967 he was appointed the first Avalon professor in the humanities, a post which he held until his retirement in 1979.<br>
<br>Although he never married, Heller had a family life because his brother Paul (a survivor of wartime concentration camps) was professor of medicine at the University of Illinois and lived with his family near Chicago. Erich Heller was frequently honoured&#151;for example, by the award of the Goethe medal of the Goethe Institut (1968), of the fellowship of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1971), and of the Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (1978). Among his papers, which are deposited at Northwestern University, are exchanges of letters and cards with T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, and Werner Heisenberg. He died at Evanston, near Chicago, on 5 November 1990.<br>
<br>Erich Heller was the author of six books: <span class="italic">The Disinherited Mind</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Thomas Mann: the Ironic German</span> (1958)&#151;both of which appeared while he was at Swansea&#151;<span class="italic">The Artist's Journey into the Interior</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Kafka</span> (1974), <span class="italic">In the Age of Prose</span> (1984), and <span class="italic">The Importance of Nietzsche</span> (1988). Three aspects of his writings are especially noteworthy. One is that they all have a unifying theme, which derives from Heller's sense of the devalued, uprooted state of the modern world. For him, the finest representatives of that fraught condition were those writers who most strenuously felt, diagnosed, explored, and resented that spiritual wasteland. The second recurring strand has to do with Germanness. Most of the writers whom Heller cherished were German; but this allegiance to one national literature did not betoken any kind of cultural patriotism on his part; rather he felt that the troubled, often problematic course of German history had brought about an unusual coexistence of high cultural sophistication on the one hand and political catastrophe on the other. He saw German culture, then, as offering a particularly clear, painful, and pained articulation of the modern condition. Third, Heller wrote all his major works in English first, before then translating them into German. It was a quite remarkable English that he wrote: urbane, passionate, profound, moving easily, almost casually, between journalistic and scholarly (often very abstract) vocabularies. He was very fond of the essay form, which he understood in its English mode (as having more to do with registers of spoken immediacy than with austere scholarly dispassion): <span class="italic">The Disinherited Mind</span> grew out of material first published in Michael Oakeshott's <span class="italic">Cambridge Journal</span>, <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. He once wrote:<blockquote>I have grown so allergic to words like &#147;Rilke-Forschung&#148; or &#147;Kafka scholarship&#148; that I was rather negligent in providing references, a rather tiresome way of proving one's &#147;scholarliness&#148;; but partly also because of my&#151;possibly overambitious&#151;wish that these essays should be read as essays rather than be looked upon as sources of learned information. (<span class="italic">In the Age of Prose</span>, 1984, xii)</blockquote>It was, then, arguably Heller's signal achievement to have made the concerns of major German writers and thinkers of the past two centuries or so central to any thoroughgoing understanding of the energies and depradations of modern culture. He mediated between German and Anglo-American culture by thinking and writing in a discourse that truly seemed to embody not some dreary compromise but rather the quickening confluence of the best of both worlds. Particularly in the aftermath of the Second World War his voice had matchless urgency and force. This kind of voice had more to offer to the 1950s and 1960s than to the 1970s and 1980s. And this may account for the fact that Heller's later works seem to be engaged in restating what has already been said with rare authority in <span class="italic">The Disinherited Mind</span> and in <span class="italic">Thomas Mann: the Ironic German</span>. But even so it must be stressed that precisely Heller's urgent, impassioned, buttonholing mode made him a wonderfully committed and engaged teacher. Generations of students were in his debt because he gave them a firm sense of why literature mattered, and mattered in terms that went beyond any notion of cultural adornment. He was an unforgettable lecturer. Moreover&#151;and this is something that is not always evident because of the spiritual fervour of his published work&#151;he could be a wonderfully funny raconteur. One of his best anecdotes was told against himself, and it invoked the herculean efforts he made as dean of arts at Swansea to produce a passable simulacrum of knowing what he was doing and saying when he presented his students for their degrees&#151;in Welsh.<br>
