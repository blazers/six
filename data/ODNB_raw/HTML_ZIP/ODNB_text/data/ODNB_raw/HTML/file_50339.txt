<span class="headword">Brewer,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1244), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was a nephew and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the baron <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3369/', "William Brewer")</script>, an important royal servant with considerable territorial interests and frequent employment in Devon; nothing is known of either his parentage or his education. Through his namesake's influence Brewer obtained, in the vacancy after Bishop Henry Marshal's death in 1206, the episcopal church of Braunton (1208) and the cathedral precentorship; and in the vacancy after Bishop Simon's death (September 1223), when the baron was royal custodian of the bishopric, Brewer was quickly elected to the see and was consecrated on 21 April 1224. No one thought him learned, but his promotion was not considered scandalous.<br>
<br>Brewer assumed office towards the close of Henry III's turbulent minority and was caught up in the new spirit of liberty in English society sparked off in 1215 by <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. His cathedral chapter, dissatisfied with its archaic constitution and lack of an elective head, had probably made reform a precondition of his election, and within two years he agreed to the creation of the offices of an elective dean and a chancellor, endowed the deanery, and increased the revenues of the other dignitaries, the vicars-choral, and the common fund, all at the expense of the episcopal estate. He sanctioned the building of a chapter house and started to erect a new palace. He agreed not to confirm or alienate in perpetuity any churches or lands without the consent of the dean and chapter. And he issued in a synod the first comprehensive set of statutes for his diocese. These owed much to those promulgated at Salisbury. He also granted charters of liberties to the boroughs he founded at Crediton and Penryn.<br>
<br>Hardly had Brewer been consecrated than Henry III ordered him to take custody of the rebel Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute;'s castle at Plympton; and he would have taken it by storm had not his troops demurred. His creation of a semi-independent capitular government at Exeter increased his own freedom. In the summer of 1227, making use of the 4000 marks of silver bequeathed to him in 1226 by his uncle, the baron, he sailed from Brindisi with his friend Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester, for the Holy Land, where the two played an important part in its affairs both before and after the arrival of the emperor Frederick II on his belated crusade. In March 1228 Brewer visited Jerusalem, liberated by the emperor, and, since his presence is not noted at Exeter before April 1231, he probably then accompanied des Roches on his leisurely return through Italy and France, engaged in diplomatic business. Back in England, he carried out some diplomatic missions for Henry III: in 1234, again with des Roches, treating for peace with Louis IX of France; in 1235 conducting Henry's sister, Isabella, to her marriage with the emperor at Worms in July; and early in 1236 again negotiating in France. In January 1241 he crossed the channel with the departing papal legate, Otto, bound for Gregory IX's (abortive) general council at Rome. He reached Pontigny by 24 March. Before October 1231 he was constructing with the king's help a deer park at Faringdon, parcel of his chapelry of Bosham, and royal gifts of deer, venison, and timber were regular until August 1237.<br>
<br>The man of action was also pious. Brewer was devoted to the Virgin Mary and founded at Crediton a hermitage dedicated to her. He was generous to religious houses and interested in indulgences. He fostered the religious services in his cathedral, and was remembered as the greatest donor of vestments and ornaments to the cathedral treasury; his anniversary service was awarded the exceptional use of eight candles. Brewer requested permission to resign, and on 15 December 1244 Pope Innocent IV ordered the new bishop of Winchester to receive his resignation; but he had already died, on 24 November. The chronicler Matthew Paris noted that he was remarkable for his good character, noble birth, and ability, perhaps an understatement of his virtues.<br>
