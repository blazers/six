<span class="headword">Cornwallis,  Caroline Frances</span>  (1786&#150;1858), <span class="occ">author and feminist</span>, was born on 12 July 1786 at Wittersham, Kent, the second of two daughters of Revd William Cornwallis (1751&#150;1827), rector of Elham and Wittersham in Kent. Her mother, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris), wrote a number of religious works, including <span class="italic">A Preparation for the Lord's Supper &hellip; Intended for the Use of Ladies</span> (1826; 3rd edn, 1838), which revealed views similar to those of the evangelical Hannah More. Caroline Cornwallis demonstrated remarkable intellectual capacity as a child and wrote prodigiously from the age of seven. In 1803 her sister, to whom she had been extremely close, died following the birth of her first child. In her grief, Cornwallis pledged herself to a frugal way of life, devoting herself to scholarship and to her parents, and living &#145;as if there had been no gaieties in the world&#146;  (Cornwallis to Miss Liscomb, 25 Dec 1844; Cornwallis, 268). During this period, despite poor health, she learned many languages, including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, Anglo-Saxon, and Ancient Egyptian, as well as studying philosophy, science, history, law, theology, and politics. In 1826 she moved to Pescia, Italy, where she was lent a house by a close friend, the historian Jean Charles L. Simonde de Sismondi. The change in environment and beauty of the Italian landscape appear to have given her a new zest for life. However, she continued to study as hard as ever, focusing on mineralogy and Tuscan law. In 1827 she travelled to England to be with her mother, following the death of her father, and returned to Italy in 1829 before settling permanently in Kent, where she owned farm property.<br>
<br>In 1842 Cornwallis's first published work appeared, <span class="italic">Philosophical Theories and Philosophical Experience, by a Pariah</span>. This formed the first volume of an ambitious project, <span class="roman">Small Books on Great Subjects</span>. The aim was to popularize difficult subjects for a general readership and was the result of a collaboration between Cornwallis and a small group of unnamed friends, whom she called the ABC Society. The majority of the twenty-two volumes, covering a remarkable variety of subjects, including philosophy, chemistry, theology, grammar, geology, and criminal law, were written by Cornwallis herself, and enjoyed a wide readership in both Britain and America.<br>
<br>A committed Christian, Cornwallis also wrote on the decline of Christianity and the need for it to be understood as a philosophical system based upon rational principles (see, for example, her contribution to the <span class="roman">Small Books</span> series, <span class="italic">On the State of Man Subsequent to the Promulgation of Christianity</span>, 1851&#150;4). She had earlier been involved in the production of her mother's theological works, though she came to describe herself as an episcopalian, distancing herself from her mother's evangelicalism. In 1846 Cornwallis wrote a historical novel, <span class="italic">Pericles</span>, which received some favourable reviews, but she did not carry out her intention of writing a sequel.<br>
<br>In the latter part of her life Cornwallis became particularly interested in schemes to prevent crime, arguing firmly that prevention was better than punishment. The solution she most favoured was the establishment of &#145;ragged schools&#146;, offering a basic education to the most destitute of children. She suggested that school meals might be provided and that children should also be instructed in a trade. In 1853 her essay on juvenile delinquency was bracketed with that of Micaiah Hill for a prize of &pound;200 offered by Lady Byron. Cornwallis believed that the suffrage might be extended to all classes of society once education was enjoyed by all.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Cornwallis felt frustrated and inhibited by the position of women within contemporary society. She longed to have enjoyed the academic opportunities open to men of her class and chafed against the domestic duties which had distracted her from her studies. By the 1840s her private letters reveal that such feelings were developing into a deeply held feminist consciousness&#151;comparing women's position to that of black slaves and calling for women's emancipation and the vindication of their rights. These sentiments were given their fullest expression in two seminal articles on the inequities of married women's legal position which appeared in the advanced Liberal journal the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> in 1856 and 1857. Written at the height of the bitter debates then raging in parliament over proposed changes to married women's legal rights, the anonymous essays became widely cited and proved to be very influential. It is by these essays that Cornwallis is best remembered. She used her extensive grasp of the workings of the law to trace the development and social purposes of the system of common law. With the use of telling examples she argued that by denying property rights to married women the law revealed itself to be a relic from a &#145;semi-barbarous&#146; age. Cornwallis maintained that such a system degraded not only marital relations but the whole tenor of society. She advocated legal reform based upon the principle of the &#145;inalienable rights&#146; of every human being. Only then, she insisted, might women make their full contribution to society. At the time of writing the articles Cornwallis was extremely ill, but she persevered in their composition, believing that it was a cause &#145;of the deepest import to the highest interests of humanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections</span>, vii).<br>
<br>In addition to her scholarly interests Cornwallis was also artistically gifted&#151;a favourite pastime was to create models from wax. However, this interest was overshadowed by her great passion for science. She was extremely knowledgeable on contemporary developments and discoveries. She was friendly with Michael Faraday, who, she was pleased to report with characteristic self-confidence, &#145;allows me to question his notions&#146;  (Cornwallis to Miss Mansfield, 1844; <span class="italic">Selections</span>, 260). A single woman (she turned down a marriage proposal from Sismondi), Cornwallis enjoyed the companionship of a circle of many such accomplished friends. She was particularly close to David Power QC, the author of several works on electoral law, and to Samuel Birch, the orientalist, who shared her views on women's position. She was cousin to the mother of Dorothea Beale, the celebrated pioneer of girls' schools, and while Miss Beale did not know Cornwallis personally, she claimed that her relative's literary achievements had been a great inspiration to her. Cornwallis was described as &#145;large-featured, tall and thin&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), though in her self-portrait she presented herself as tall and rather glamorous, with striking eyes. She suffered from debilitating illness for much of her life and was often bedridden. However, this physical weakness was greatly belied by her vigorous and dominant personality. Cornwallis died at her home, Sidwells, Goudhurst, Kent, on 8 January 1858, and was buried in the churchyard of Linton, near Maidstone.<br>
