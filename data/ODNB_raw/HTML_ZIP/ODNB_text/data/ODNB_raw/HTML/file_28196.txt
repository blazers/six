<span class="headword">Vennor,  Henry George</span>  (1840&#150;1884), <span class="occ">geologist and meteorologist</span>, was born on 30 December 1840 in Montreal, Lower Canada, the son of Henry Vennor, hardware merchant, and his wife, Marion Paterson. He was educated at Philips School and the high school in Montreal before enrolling at McGill University in the late 1850s. There Vennor studied civil engineering, geology, mineralogy, and zoology under professors including Sir John William Dawson and Thomas Sterry Hunt, while simultaneously taking chemistry at the Montreal Medical College. After graduating with honours in 1860, he spent five years in the employ of the mercantile firm of Frothingham and Workman.<br>
<br>From an early age it became evident that Vennor possessed the aptitude and interests to be a naturalist. While still a schoolboy, he had assembled a collection of local reptiles (mostly snakes), preserved in alcohol and displayed at a provincial exhibition; it eventually became the property of McGill University. Part of his leisure time was devoted also at this time to studying the weather and amassing large collections of the birds and fossils of Montreal Island. By 1865 he had several papers on the ornithology of Canada published in the <span class="italic">Canadian Naturalist</span> and the <span class="italic">British American Magazine</span>. This was followed, in 1876, by the appearance of his book <span class="italic">Our Birds of Prey, or, The Eagles, Hawks, and Owls of Canada</span>.<br>
<br>Five years after graduating from college, Vennor embarked on a career in geology, working under Sir William Edmond Logan, director of the geological survey of Canada, on a survey of Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron. During this time his zeal as an amateur naturalist drove him to gather, in his free time, a collection of the birds he encountered, a collection subsequently donated to Queen's College, Kingston. In 1866 Vennor became a permanent staff member of the survey and began to develop detailed topographical maps of south-eastern Ontario and Pontiac county, Quebec. It was there that he conducted the majority of his field work during his years with the survey. In 1867 he published a ground-breaking paper on the stratigraphy of the Precambrian Shield in the Hastings county area in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London</span> (23/1, 256&#150;7); he was elected a fellow of the society in 1870. While mapping the geographical distributions of the Laurentian Mountains, he began to record in detail the economically significant mineral and metal deposits in the region. In the process, he discovered Precambrian gold in a mine in Hastings county in 1866. Initially he down-played the importance of this find, but it nevertheless led to a brief gold rush in the region.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Vennor actively promoted the interests of local mining operators and he was instrumental in directing their attention to the phosphate deposits in Ottawa county as early as 1872, a mining industry which boomed during the 1880s and remained profitable long thereafter. He continued to work for the geological survey on projects that traced the Precambrian formations of the Laurentian Mountains; he reported his findings in seven reports for the geological survey of Canada. Partly because these reports were never published, he came into conflict with Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn, who was the survey's director from 1869 to 1895. The two men quarrelled frequently over working conditions and the preferential advancement of a younger generation of geologists, such as George Mercer Dawson, over the more experienced members of the survey. Vennor continued, meanwhile, to focus his efforts on promoting the economic development of local minerals until, in 1881, he was &#145;dismissed for using his position to traffic in phosphate lands in the Ottawa valley&#146;  (Zaslow, 136). He subsequently opened a consulting office in Montreal.<br>
<br>Over the years, Vennor developed a personal interest in meteorology. Interested in weather forecasting, he compiled and compared data on weather patterns and believed that he had detected a &#145;law of recurrences&#146; which allowed for a degree of predictability. After successfully forecasting Montreal's excessively mild Christmas and new year's day in 1875, he decided to begin publishing <span class="italic">Vennor's Almanac</span> annually from 1877. This venture was so successful in terms of distribution and critical acclaim that by 1881 he not only issued a separate American edition, but he also published <span class="italic">Vennor's Weather Bulletin</span> monthly throughout 1882 and part of 1883. Vennor died in Montreal on 8 June 1884 and was buried two days later. Walter Smith, who continued to publish the almanac after Vennor's death, claimed in the 1885 edition that Vennor was survived by a wife and three children, but no mention of them is made in any contemporary obituaries.<br>
