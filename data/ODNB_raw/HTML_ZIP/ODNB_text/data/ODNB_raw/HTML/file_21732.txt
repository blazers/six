<span class="headword">Pebody,  Charles</span>  (1839&#150;1890), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born at Queen Street, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 3 February 1839, the son of Charles Pebody, a household servant, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cory. His parents moved to Watford, Northamptonshire, from where the family had originated, and Pebody was sent to the village school, being taught privately by the schoolmaster afterwards. At the age of fourteen he went to London, where he joined a lawyer's office, but soon found work as a reporter, eventually joining the staff of the <span class="italic">Chelmsford Chronicle</span>. At the age of twenty-one he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Barnstaple Times</span> and at about the same time, on 22 August 1859, he married Mary Ann Martyn, the daughter of Henry Martyn, a bank clerk from Essex. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>From Barnstaple Pebody moved to Exeter as editor of the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span>, and from Exeter to Bristol as editor of the <span class="italic">Bristol Times and Mirror</span>. In 1875, when living in Bristol, Pebody won the prize of &pound;50 offered by James Heywood for the best essay revision of the rubrics in the prayer book. His other works included <span class="italic">Authors at Work</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">English Journalism and the Men who have Made it</span> (1882).<br>
<br>In 1882 Pebody was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, a Conservative daily paper published at Leeds, a position he held from 1 October. During his time as editor the paper rapidly grew in circulation and influence, and by the year of his death had become one of the most important and influential local newspapers. An enthusiastic journalist, Pebody was a member of the board of directors of the Press Association and a member of the Yorkshire Newspaper Society, and was elected president of the West Riding district of the national Institute of Journalists by the working journalists of west Yorkshire at an annual meeting.<br>
<br>In 1888 Pebody suffered internal pain, supposedly from gout in the stomach, but after six months' rest he resumed work and organized a new evening paper. He died at his home, Towerhurst, 20 De Grey Terrace, Leeds, on 30 October 1890, survived by his wife; he was buried on 3 November in Lawnswood cemetery. Doctors diagnosed that he died from a malignant ulcer in the stomach.<br>
