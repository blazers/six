<span class="headword">Young,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1825), <span class="occ">mezzotint-engraver</span>, studied under Valentine Green, with whom he remained familiar until the latter's death in 1813. He continued to work with several of the painters who collaborated with Green, notably Benjamin West, John Hoppner, and Johann Gerhard Huck. On 16 July 1784 he married Elizabeth Gibbs, of South Mimms, Hertfordshire. He began to publish his own prints in 1785 and was trading with Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois Basan in France before 1788. At this time he lived adjacent to Green at 28 Newman Street, a street that was then home to several leading artists. He moved to Store Street in 1789 and later to Charlotte Street, but remained in this area of Westminster throughout his life. Young executed some eighty portraits after various contemporaries, including several notable portraits of boxers, but was better known for his subject pieces, chiefly after West, Johann Zoffany, and especially Richard Morton Paye and Hoppner, with whom he collaborated frequently. In 1789 he was appointed mezzotint engraver to the prince of Wales, to whom Hoppner was portrait painter.<br>
<br>In 1813 Young succeeded Green as keeper of the British Institution, an arduous post which he filled until his death with unfailing tact and efficiency, for, as his obituarist recorded, &#145;he was a friend of artists, and a conciliator where many sore feelings, jealousies and angry passions are constantly generated&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 95/1, 1825, 466). He was honorary secretary of the Artists' Benevolent Fund from 1810 to 1813, when he transferred his services to the rival body, the Artists' General Benevolent Institution. In later life he published <span class="italic">Portraits of the Emperors of Turkey from the Foundation of the Monarchy to the Year 1808</span> (1815), thirty plates printed in colours, with the lives of the emperors in English and French text. He then worked on a series of catalogues, illustrated by his own etchings, of some leading collections of paintings in Britain&#151;the Grosvenor, Leicester, Miles, Angerstein, and Stafford galleries. He was working on a catalogue of the king's collection at Carlton Palace at the time of his death, after a long illness, at his house at 65 Upper Charlotte Street on 7 March 1825. A sale of his prints and books was held on 25 May.<br>
