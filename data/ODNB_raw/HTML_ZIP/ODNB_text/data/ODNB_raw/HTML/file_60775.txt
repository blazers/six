<span class="headword">Medd,  Henry Alexander Nesbitt</span>  (1892&#150;1977), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 21 September 1892 at the rectory, North Cerney, Gloucestershire, where his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34971/', "Peter Goldsmith Medd (1829&#150;1908)")</script>, one of the founders of Keble College, Oxford, had been rector since 1876; his mother was Louisa, the daughter of Alexander Nesbitt of Byfield House, Barnes. Medd had to overcome physical disabilities as well as being the youngest in the family. Poor eyesight prevented him joining the Indian forestry service as he wished and it was decided that he should be an architect. In 1911 he was articled to the ecclesiastical designer Frederick Charles Eden who, by coincidence, would later embellish North Cerney church; he also attended evening classes at the Architectural Association in London. Repeatedly rejected for war service on medical grounds during the First World War, Medd was fortunate to be employed by Edwin Lutyens in the Apple Tree Yard office working on the drawings for New Delhi (the British having moved the Indian capital from Calcutta in 1911 and embarked on building a new imperial capital next to the old Mughal capital, &#145;Old Delhi&#146;). Later in the war he worked as a turner in a munitions factory and on the erection of a large tank factory for the Anglo-American Commission in France. <br>
<br>In the autumn of 1919 a meeting with one of Herbert Baker's assistants resulted in Medd's successful application to act as Baker's assistant representative in Delhi; &#145;Such was the fortuitous encounter which set me on the course I was to pursue for the best part of my working life&#146;, he later recalled  (&#145;What India meant to me&#146;, 44). A few weeks later Medd found himself on the SS <i>Egypt</i> with Lutyens bound for Bombay. At Christmas, soon after his arrival in Delhi, Lutyens encouraged him to see Agra. &#145;On this occasion I also visited Fatehpur Sikri, always a favourite of mine, and it was on that first excursion into India's past that was laid the foundation of what has remained a life-long interest in Indian history, archaeology and architecture&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Medd's task in Delhi was to receive, interpret, and, if necessary, adapt the drawings sent from Baker's office in London. These were mostly for the secretariat buildings flanking Viceroy's House and for the circular legislative assembly building required by the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms of 1919. However, although it was Baker for whom Medd acted, it was Lutyens who was his mentor and inspiration, and the paramount influence of Lutyens is evident in Medd's own executed buildings. In 1925 Medd won a competition, assessed by Lutyens, for an Anglican church in New Delhi, but the project was aggrandized following the arrival of Lord Halifax as viceroy the following year. The church (later cathedral) of the Redemption was begun in 1927 on a new site on an axis north of Viceroy's House; the central tower and dome were completed in 1935. The influence of both Palladio and Wren is evident in the design, but it is also very reminiscent of Lutyens's Free Church at Hampstead Garden Suburb in London; when Medd sent him photographs of the church under construction, his hero wrote back that he was surprised and horrified to see that Viceroy's House was being demolished. Medd also designed the Roman Catholic church (also later a cathedral) of the Sacred Heart in New Delhi, won in competition in 1927. Based on the Ges&ugrave; in Rome, the interior employs the idea of a hierarchy of arches developed by Lutyens for his Liverpool Cathedral project. The west front had to be redesigned with two towers to incorporate a huge cartouche of St Francis ordered from Florence without consultation with the architect. Medd later admitted that the towers were &#145;rather banal. I could have done better than that&#146;  (personal knowledge). <br>
<br>In 1931, on the inauguration of the new capital, Medd returned home to England and, in addition to working on the drawings for his Delhi churches, vainly attempted to resume practice by entering architectural competitions. However, unlike his Delhi colleague A. G. Shoosmith, Medd was eventually able to return to India. In 1935 he was appointed consulting architect to the government of the Central Provinces and Berar with the specific task of designing a new high court building at Nagpur (1937&#150;42). Medd recorded that &#145;the work was absorbing. But I was alone, isolated, there was not a soul with whom I could discuss a professional matter other than those of a structural nature which the P.W.D. [Public Works Department] were able and willing to solve&#146;  (&#145;What India meant to me&#146;, 45).<br>
<br>In 1939 Medd succeeded Robert Tor Russell as chief architect to the government of India, an appointment blighted by the outbreak of the Second World War. His principal task was to plan the huge amount of temporary accommodation in New Delhi required by the war effort, and Medd achieved this without sacrificing a single tree planted in the new capital. &#145;It was a sad time for me&#146; Medd nevertheless later recalled. &#145;I used to feel that, though I had a good deal to do with the original New Delhi, I was now the principal instrument of spoiling it&#146;  (&#145;What India meant to me&#146;, 46). More congenial was involvement in restoration work at the Badshahi mosque in Lahore and at the Taj Mahal in Agra; he also succeeded in designing a new mint for Calcutta in an appropriate neo-classical style. On 21 September 1945, while on home leave, he married Marjorie Isabel Lloyd (1898&#150;1986) of Carmarthen, the daughter of the Revd John Francis Lloyd. He was appointed OBE the following year.<br>
<br>Medd left India at independence in 1947. His wife later revealed that he burst into tears on the quay at Bombay when he realized that he might never see India again. After this, he was obliged to take on work scarcely commensurate with his achievements in India until he retired from architectural practice. Although a convinced classicist with little sympathy for either the arts and crafts approach or modernism, he unsuccessfully submitted a design in a traditional Islamic manner in the competition for the mausoleum of Mohamed Ali Jinnah in Karachi in 1958. A man of strong moral convictions, always modest about his own achievements, he was pleased to be master of the Art-Workers' Guild in 1959, thus following in the footsteps of Sir Edwin Lutyens, to whose memory he remained devoted. Living latterly in Ashley Gardens, Emery Hill Street, Westminster, he died of cancer of the colon in St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, on 26 October 1977. A plaque commemorating him in the cathedral church of the Redemption, New Delhi, was unveiled in 1982.<br>
