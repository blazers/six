<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Robert Wylie</span>  (1868&#150;1958), <span class="occ">collector and mountaineer</span>, was born at Grove House, Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Lancashire, the only son of John Lloyd, a calico printer, and his wife, Rachel Wylie (1844&#150;1890). His grandfather was Nathaniel Lloyd, a successful calico printer at Church, Accrington. His father and mother separated, and he was brought up by his mother in reduced circumstances at Clapham. He started work as a clerk in Mincing Lane in the City of London, and by ruthless determination became a rich businessman, not only as managing director of his own company, Nathaniel Lloyd Ltd, colour printers and paper manufacturers, but also as a director of Druce &amp; Co. Ltd, Chadwicks (Manchester) Ltd, cotton piece finishers, and Christie, Manson, and Woods Ltd.<br>
<br>It was at Clapham that Lloyd first started to collect beetles and butterflies, of which he made an important collection, and it was in pursuit of his entomological interests that he climbed the hills of Norway, and there discovered the fascination of mountains. Lloyd made important ascents in the Valais, the Matterhorn, and Mont Blanc, accounts of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>. He travelled in the old style, with one or two first-rate guides, but after a serious operation had put an end to his own climbs he devoted his energies to raising funds for the expeditions of others, including the celebrated Mount Everest expedition of 1953. It was said that his assiduity in raising funds was matched only by his extreme reluctance to part with them.<br>
<br>Lloyd was a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London from 1885 and a member of the Alpine Club from 1901. He was scrupulously honest but at the same time had a dour strain and a vein of ruthlessness in his character. He never married. He died in his chambers at 15 The Albany, Piccadilly, London, on 29 April 1958, and was buried, at his express wish, in his mother's grave in the necropolis, Glasgow.<br>
<br>Lloyd's substantial collections of alpine books were left to the National Library of Scotland, his Swiss topographical prints and drawings and his Turner drawings to the British Museum, as were his Japanese swords and Chinese red lacquer. His entomological collections are at Manchester University. He was also a collector of Napoleonica&#151;he bequeathed a portrait of the emperor to the museums of France&#151;and he was known to express regret that Wellington had won at Waterloo. The variety of his collections provoked the opinion that he was essentially a collector of collections.<br>
