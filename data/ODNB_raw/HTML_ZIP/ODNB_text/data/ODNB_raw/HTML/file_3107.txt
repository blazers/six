<span class="headword">Boyd,  James</span>  (1795&#150;1856), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, the son of a glover, was born at Paisley on 24 December 1795. After receiving his early education partly in Paisley and partly in Glasgow, he entered Glasgow University, where he gained some of the highest honours in the humanity, Greek, and philosophy classes. After taking his degrees of BA and MA (1817), he devoted himself for two years to the study of medicine, but, having abandoned this pursuit, entered the Divinity Hall of the University of Glasgow, and was licensed to preach the gospel by the presbytery of Dumbarton in May 1822. Towards the close of that year he removed to Edinburgh, where for three years he maintained himself by private tuition. In 1825 he was unanimously chosen house governor in George Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh. The University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of laws in 1827. He married, on 24 December 1829, Jane Reid, eldest daughter of John Easton, an Edinburgh merchant. They had nine children.<br>
<br>Boyd became classical master at Edinburgh high school on 19 August 1829; from this time he edited published editions of a number of classical texts. For many years he was also secretary to the Edinburgh Society of Teachers. He died at his house in George Square, Edinburgh, on 18 August 1856, having taught for nearly twenty-seven years in the high school. He was buried at New Calton, Edinburgh, on 21 August. The affectionate respect in which he was held by his pupils was shown after his death. Two &#145;Boyd clubs&#146; were formed in the Crimea during the Russian war by British officers who had been taught by him, and other societies were founded in his honour by his classes. At a meeting held in Edinburgh his friends and pupils subscribed for a medal, to be named the &#145;Boyd medal&#146;, and to be annually presented to the &#145;dux&#146; of the class in the high school taught by Boyd's successor.<br>
