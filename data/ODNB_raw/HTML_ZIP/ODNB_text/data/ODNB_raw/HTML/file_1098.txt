</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baird, Sir  David</span>, first baronet  (1757&#150;1829), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 26 December 1757 at Newbyth, Haddingtonshire, the fifth son of William Baird (<i>c</i>.1711&#150;1766), merchant, and Alicia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnstone, of Hiltown, Berwick (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1787). Baird's siblings included five sisters, two older, two younger, and one close in age, and two younger brothers. Within years of his birth the family moved to Gordon House, near the top of Castle Hill, Edinburgh. After William Baird's death the family faced financial hardship and young David gave his mother some difficulty. The commission Baird obtained as an ensign in the 2nd regiment of foot on 14 December 1772 had been purchased by his mother for an older, more promising brother who died suddenly. Before sailing to Gibraltar to join his regiment in April 1773, Baird attended Lewis Loch&eacute;e's military academy at Chelsea, where, as a 6 feet tall, athletic youth he enjoyed the emphasis on physical activity. He otherwise lacked education, being &#145;too volatile to attend closely to study&#146;  (Hook, 1.2), but proved a brave soldier and a good regimental officer who, over the course of three decades, saw active service on three continents. A comrade recalled him as &#145;a fine soldier-like man; with such a determined air, that you might draw the inference from his countenance, that he was ready, if ordered, to march into a fiery furnace&#146;  (&#145;Recollections of the British army&#146;, 191).<h2>
<a name="India17801801"></a>India, 1780&#150;1801</h2>Having returned from Gibraltar with his regiment in 1776, Baird obtained a leave of absence and travelled to Elgin, where, on 26 December 1777, he became a captain in Lord Macleod's new regiment, the 73rd highlanders. The regiment was ordered to India and embarked for Portsmouth on 8 May 1778. They arrived fifteen days later, missing the India-bound fleet's departure, and were sent to the Channel Islands, then subject to French threat. After spending six months on Guernsey, they returned to Portsmouth in November, wintered nearby at Petersfield, departed for India on 7 March 1779, and reached Madras on 20 January 1780. In July 1780 Haidar Ali, ruler of Mysore, attacked Madras and the nawab of Arcot, a British ally. Baird accompanied the force sent to the relief of Arcot when, on 10 September 1780 at Perambaukum, they were surrounded and destroyed by Haidar and his son Tipu Sultan. Baird's corps &#145;fought with such determination and heroism, that many of them were seen loading their muskets after their legs had been shot away; almost all disdained to accept quarter&#146;  (Hildyard, 17). With sabre wounds to the head, a pike wound in the arm, and a ball in the thigh, Baird fell senseless to the ground. Nearly left for dead his pillaged body was found by two comrades; the trio were soon among Haidar's prisoners. Referring to her son's active disposition, a variously quoted apocryphal story credits Baird's mother, upon learning of her son's capture, with the statement &#145;God help the puir man that's chained to my Davy&#146;  (&#145;Investigator&#146;, 5). Baird received rudimentary medical treatment before he was carried in a litter to Seringapatam, Mysore's fortified capital, while the other 250 captives made the journey on foot. At Seringapatam the fifty officers were kept in &#145;small rooms, or rather dungeons&#146;  (Lindsay, 3.278), often with 9 lb irons shackled to each leg. The hungry and diseased prisoners manufactured clothing for themselves and, when not chained, grew food. On 11 March 1784, with the signing of the treaty of Mangalore, the survivors were released. After a brief convalescence Baird joined his regiment near Arcot. He became a major on 5 June 1787, obtained a leave of absence, and departed India in October 1787.<br>
<br>After three years in Britain he became a lieutenant-colonel on 8 December 1790 and returned to India in March 1791 to participate in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, a conflict precipitated in December 1789 by Tipu's attack on Travancore, a British ally. He arrived at Madras during the summer of 1791, and joined Governor-General Cornwallis's army near the recently captured town of Bangalore. Advancing slowly, Cornwallis reached Seringapatam on 5 February 1792, and the following evening attacked the force Tipu had assembled before his capital. During this action Baird successfully led his highland regiment and four Indian battalions against troops entrenched on Carrighaut Hill. Two weeks later peace was settled and Cornwallis's army dispersed. Baird was stationed at Madura when news arrived of the French declaration of war against Britain. He was ordered to Pondicherry and attended when the city surrendered without a fight on 22 August 1793. From Pondicherry Baird was dispatched to Tanjore to command the British force hired by the local raja. He worked against the plans of Lord Hobart, governor of Madras, to obtain greater control over the raja's military and fiscal affairs. Although Governor-General Sir John Shore blocked Hobart's venture, Baird was moved from Tanjore in September 1796. A year later he and his regiment were rotated home.<br>
<br>Baird sailed from Madras on 17 October 1797 and arrived at Cape Town in December, when Governor George Macartney asked him to remain and train the garrison. With thoughts of succeeding Macartney, he agreed. Promoted to major-general on 18 June 1798, in October he was ordered to lead 1800 men to Madras to counter the threat posed to British India by Napoleon Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt and the reception at Seringapatam of eighty-six French soldiers sent by the governor of Mauritius. Baird reached Madras on 7 January 1799 and on 1 February joined the army gathering at Vellore under General George Harris. Two days later, having determined that Tipu's reception of French soldiers constituted a <i>casus belli</i>, Governor-General Richard Wellesley, second earl of Mornington, ordered Harris to mobilize. When the army crossed into Mysore on 5 March, Baird knew &#145;Our object is Tippoo&#146;  (Baird to R. Baird, 13 Feb 1799, Baird MSS, M 1995.51.2). On 5 April Seringapatam was reached. A siege commenced, and once the walls were breached in early May, Harris decided to storm the city. Baird volunteered to lead the assault: he wanted, he said, to &#145;pay off old scores&#146;  (Hook, 1.205). The night before the assault he led men into the forward entrenchments located 1000 yards from the breach. At 1 p.m. on 4 May 1799 Baird rose from his trench yelling &#145;Come, my brave fellows, follow me, and prove yourselves worthy the name of British soldiers&#146;  (Beatson, 126) and in six minutes led 4000 men through heavy rocket and musket fire across the Cauvery River and into Seringapatam. They seized the ramparts and within hours had overcome all opposition. In the palace Baird took custody of royal prisoners and soon discovered Tipu:<blockquote>we found a man who being severely threatened said that the Sultan was killed in attempting to escape thru' the northern sally port and offered to conduct us to the body. We accordingly proceeded thither and under a slaughtered heap of several hundreds, many of whom were men of consequence in his service, had the pleasure to discover the body of the Sultan. He had been shot thru the head and body and was quite dead. (Baird to Harris, 6 May 1799, Baird MSS, M 1995.51, fol. 3)</blockquote>The following morning Baird's breakfast was disrupted by Colonel Arthur Wellesley, the governor-general's brother and the future duke of Wellington, who arrived with orders to supersede Baird to the command of Seringapatam. Maladroitly relieved of his conquest by a junior officer, Baird left Tipu's palace without finishing his meal. Mutual antipathy lingered.<h2>
<a name="EgyptandCapeTown18001807"></a>Egypt and Cape Town, 1800&#150;1807</h2>After the war Baird was stationed at Dinapore, Bengal, from where he wrote that he was &#145;a soldier whose greatest ambition ever has been and ever will be to endeavour to gain the approbation and applause of his King and Country&#146;, but who was &#145;now heartily sick of this country and wish to get home as soon as I can with propriety&#146;  (Baird to R. Baird, 13 June 1800, Baird MSS, M 1995.51, fol. 8). In 1801 he was instructed to lead an expedition to the Red Sea, co-operating with a larger force attacking Egypt from the Mediterranean. He sailed from Bombay in early April 1801 with 5000 men and reached Quseir on 8 June, from where he dispatched parties of engineers and sepoys 100 miles across the desert. After they had established a string of food and water depots between Quseir and the Nile, Baird, wanting to &#145;get forward&#146;  (S. Auchmuty to C. Beresford, 22 June 1801, Baird MSS, M 1995.44), sent the first of five columns to Keneh. The rest followed, and by 8 July all had reached the Nile. From Keneh, Baird floated 400 miles down the Nile, arriving at Alexandria in September, immediately after the French had capitulated to General John Hutchinson. The French removed from Egypt, Baird sailed from Suez in May 1802 and reached Calcutta in August. He left India for good in March 1803, after being superseded once more by Arthur Wellesley.<br>
<br>In July 1805 Baird, a popular hero due to his exploits in India and Egypt, went to Cork to prepare an army to attack Cape Colony. A soldier who trained at Cork recalled that he appeared to have been &#145;bitten by a mad adjutant, or rather been inoculated with the pacing-stick drill&#146; as he taught his men &#145;the mystery of standing on one leg &hellip; for two hours&#146;  (&#145;Recollections of the British army&#146;, 192). On 31 August he left Ireland with 6000 troops. The force reached Table Bay on 4 January 1806 and landed two days later. On 8 January the Dutch made a stand near Cape Town. Baird described the battle of Blauberg:<blockquote>on approaching the Enemy our line was formed with much precision &amp; expedition &amp; the left or Highland Brigade advanced with utmost resolution &amp; steadiness under a severe fire of round &amp; grape-shot &amp; musketry &hellip; a charge bore down all opposition. (Baird to the duke of York, 12 Jan 1806, Baird MSS, M 199.45, fol. 90)</blockquote>Cape Town capitulated two days later. Hoping to obtain prize money, Baird, in spring 1806, agreed to lend troops to Admiral Sir Home Popham and Colonel Charles Beresford in an unsanctioned attack on Buenos Aires. Vast wealth never materialized, and Baird left Cape Town on 19 January 1807, recalled and censured by London. He was not in Britain long before sailing to the Baltic, where he led a division during the capture of Copenhagen in September 1807.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer18081809"></a>Later career, 1808&#150;1809</h2>In spring 1808 Baird spoke of &#145;rural felicity &hellip; [as] perhaps &hellip; the happiest state of any&#146;  (Baird to Young, 27 March 1808, Baird MSS, M 199.47.19) and was considering retiring when he agreed in April 1808 to train and lead an army to northern Spain, where General Sir John Moore was supporting the Seville-based junta opposed to Joseph Bonaparte's rule. He sailed from Cork with 10,000 men in September 1808 and reached Corunna on 13 October. Marching through the Le&oacute;n mountains, he reached Astorga on 19 November. A week later, before his army had completed the mountain crossing, Moore instructed him to retreat, since the French had defeated the Spanish near Madrid. After re-entering the mountains Baird received countermanding instructions. He was told Madrid had risen against the French and that:<blockquote>If the flame catches elsewhere and becomes all general, the best results may be expected. If confined to Madrid, that town will be sacrificed, and it will be as bad, or worse than ever &hellip; I mean to proceed bridle in hand; for if the bubble bursts and Madrid falls, we shall have a run for it. (Moore to Baird, 6 Dec 1808, Sorrell, 35)</blockquote>Baird turned his army around again and met Moore at Mayorga on 20 December, but the Madrid insurgency was broken, French armies approached, and they were compelled to retreat to Corunna. Morale became &#145;soured by fatigue and hunger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of William Gavin</span>, xiii) and the rearguard actions Baird helped to organize were increasingly hampered by supply shortages, a breakdown in discipline, and the harsh Spanish winter. When the army reached the mountains, a &#145;march of death&#146; began<blockquote>up Monte de Cabero &hellip; There was nothing to sustain our famished bodies, or shelter them from the rain or snow &hellip; The sick and wounded that we had been still enabled to drag with us in the waggons, were left to perish in the snow. The road was one line of bloody-footmarks, from the sore feet of men; and on its side lay the dead and dying. (Pococke, 75&#150;6)</blockquote>On 13 January 1809 Moore's army reached Corunna, and on 16 January the French attacked. Their weight centred on Baird's division, and early on grapeshot struck his left arm and torso. With his sash keeping his arm attached, he walked 2 miles to the harbour, where, on board a transport, his limb was amputated. The French were repulsed, but Moore was killed, leaving Baird commander. He relinquished his duties on 17 January and sailed home, reaching Portsmouth on 25 January 1809.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears18091829"></a>Final years, 1809&#150;1829</h2>Baird recuperated at Yardleybury, Hertfordshire, and after receiving a baronetcy on 13 April 1809, he journeyed to Scotland, declaring his intention to become &#145;a <i>great</i> and <i>good</i> farmer&#146;  (Baird to Young, 30 May 1809, Baird MSS, M 1995.47, fol. 22). On 4 August 1810 he married Ann Campbell Preston and moved to her house, Ferntower, near Crieff, Perthshire. A devoted husband, Baird jested &#145;I could command 10,000 men; yet I cannot command one woman&#146;  (Haley, 167). His torso remained painful, but he rode daily and claimed to be as good a shot with one arm as two. He was a member of the Melton Mowbray hunt, Leicestershire; it was said of Baird and a friend that except for them<blockquote>very few attempted to go strait. The fences were higher then, and no caps were worn, and both of them would have their clothes torn off their backs, and their flesh from their faces, rather then not go every inch of the way with the hounds.</blockquote>Another Meltonian commented that if Baird &#145;did get a fall, and you thought he was out of the run, he would always pop up by your side&#146;  (Paget, 82). Promoted to general on 8 May 1814, he regularly sought patronage, including the Cape governorship, and perhaps needed money to fund Ferntower's ongoing improvements. In February 1820 he became Ireland's commander-in-chief, but after a riding accident in June 1822 left Dublin without the peerage he expected. Near Ferntower in the early autumn of 1828 he had another, more serious riding accident. He wintered in London and fell ill. At a royal levee in April he was appointed commander of Fort George, but he never reached the highlands. Suffering from fevers and headaches, he travelled to Ferntower and arrived home in debilitating pain on 20 July. Baird's condition deteriorated, and he died at home on 18 August 1829. He was succeeded in his baronetcy by his nephew David Baird.<br>
<br>As well as building an obelisk commemorating her husband on a summit overlooking the Strath and hiring T. E. Hook, a popular novelist, to write her husband's biography, Lady Baird commissioned David Wilkie to paint <span class="italic">General Sir David Baird Discovering the Body of the Sultaun Tippoo Sahib</span> and insisted that her husband be depicted wearing an impressive cape; the finished work was hung in the drawing room at Ferntower. In 1813 Baird reflected on his and Wellington's careers, indicating &#145;It is the highest pride of my life that anybody should ever have dreamed of my being put in the balance with him &hellip; I know both him and myself <i>now</i>&#146;  (Edgecumbe, 2.25). The duke meanwhile remembered Baird as &#145;a gallant, hard-headed, lion-hearted officer, but he had no talent, no <i>tact</i>&#146;  (Jennings, 102), yet at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1839, where Wilkie's grand canvas was the centrepiece, he proudly told his lady companion how well he had known Sir David.<br>
