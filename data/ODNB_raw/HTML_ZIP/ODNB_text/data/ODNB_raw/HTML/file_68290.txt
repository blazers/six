<span class="headword">Rolli,  Paolo Antonio</span>  (1687&#150;1765), <span class="occ">translator and librettist</span>, was born on 13 June 1687 in Rome, son of the architect Filippo Rolli, of Burgundy, and Marta Arnaldi, of Torre Ceccona. He resided in London from 1715 or 1716 to 1744, and was a leading figure in the Italian circle and a cultural mediator between England and Italy. He was a member of several Italian academies and a fellow of the Royal Society (1729). He received a patent of nobility from Todi in Italy (1735) and styled himself &#145;patrizio tudertino&#146;. Generally ranked second to Pietro Metastasio among early eighteenth-century Italian poets, his literary reputation rests primarily on his translation of Milton and a handful of lyrics and epigrams.<br>
<br>Rolli's early education was from the church, and later at the Collegio Romano, and occasional references to &#145;l'abate Rolli&#146; suggest he may have taken minor orders. His studies were completed under the jurist and dramatist Gian Vincenzo Gravina, one of the founders of the reformist Arcadian Academy, from whom Rolli (and his fellow student Metastasio) absorbed the ideals of neo-classicism. His first publication, <span class="italic">Componimenti poetici</span> (1711), is an edition of Arcadian poetry.<br>
<br>In 1715 Rolli was invited to England by the earl of Pembroke or the earl of Stair, or perhaps both. Through his various literary activities Rolli worked to foster English appreciation of the language and classic literature of Italy. He taught Italian and Italian literature to the royal family and other noble families. The many peers to whom he dedicated his works and who subscribed to his 1725 London edition of Boccaccio's <span class="italic">Decameron</span> indicate the range of his British contacts and patrons.<br>
<br>In London Rolli published original poetry and Italian translations and editions of classics not otherwise available, including works of Anacreon, Virgil, Boccaccio, Ariosto, a group of Italian satirists, and Marchetti's famous Italian translation of Lucretius (1717). His Italian translations and editions served both scholarly and pedagogic aims by giving English students easily understandable classic Italian texts. &#145;Solitario bosco ombroso&#146; in <span class="italic">Di canzonette e di cantate</span> (1727) was long considered a model of classical perfection in Italian lyric poetry.<br>
<br>Rolli's most important contribution to Italian letters, his translation of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, is its first complete Italian translation; Rolli's preface and life of Milton are pioneering pieces of Italian Milton criticism. Despite omissions to avoid offending Roman Catholic sensibilities, the translation landed on the Index. Rolli's translation is literal and smooth, although literalness often overrides the poetic. The first six books, in folio, appeared in London in 1729; the revised, complete poem appeared in 1735 adorned with three portraits, and was dedicated to Frederick, prince of Wales, who supported the publication with &pound;100. The translation quickly acquired a European reputation and was frequently reprinted.<br>
<br>When the Royal Academy of Music (a company for producing Italian opera) was organized in 1719, Rolli became its secretary, charged primarily with providing librettos for the house composers; he was dismissed in 1722 following a dispute with the directors. He also prepared librettos for the Opera of the Nobility, established in 1733 as a rival to George Frideric Handel, and for the subsequent company headed by Lord Middlesex. Because of uncertain attributions and the vague line between original works and adaptations, the number of his librettos is uncertain; but Rolli at least produced more than twenty-four librettos and five adaptations for the London stage.<br>
<br>Rolli's correspondence with his circle of friends (including Giuseppe Riva, Senesino, Antonio Cocchi, and Gio. Giacomo Zamboni) is a wealth of observations and opinions. Rolli delights in entertaining his distant friends with the intrigues, jealousies, manoeuvres, and gossip of the musical and literary life of London. Rolli returned to Italy in 1744 and published further verse and translations. He died at Todi on 20 March 1765, and was buried there. A posthumous collection of epigrams, <span class="italic">Marziale in Albion</span> (1776), satirizes many literary and musical figures of Rolli's London days.<br>
