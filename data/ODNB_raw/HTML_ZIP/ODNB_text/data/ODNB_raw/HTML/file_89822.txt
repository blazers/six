</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Faith,  Adam</span>  (1940&#150;2003), <span class="occ">singer and actor</span>, was born Terence Nelhams Wright on 23 June 1940 at 4 Churchfield Road East, Acton, London, the third of five children of Alfred Richard (Alf) Wright (later Nelhams), coach driver, and Ellen May (Nell) Nelhams, cleaner. He was brought up on a council estate in Acton and attended John Perryn Secondary Modern School. As a teenager he supplemented the family income with a paper round and by helping his mother clean factories in the evening. In 1955 Terence Nelhams saw James Dean in <span class="italic">Rebel Without a Cause</span> and copied his clothes and mannerisms. Having left school at the age of fifteen he found employment as a messenger boy for the Rank Organisation and moved into the cutting rooms.<br>
<br>Following the popularity of Lonnie Donegan's &#145;Rock Island Line&#146;, some workmates formed a skiffle group, the Worried Men. Nelhams was the lead singer and they performed at the pivotal 2 I's coffee bar in Old Compton Street. When the BBC broadcast a live edition of the teenage programme <span class="italic">6.5 Special</span> from the 2 I's the producer Jack Good recognized Nelhams's potential. It was Good who suggested that Nelhams call himself Adam Faith, combining the names of two of Good's friends, Adam Freemantle and Nicholas Faith. Faith prepared for his first solo TV appearance by lying in the bath in his jeans so they would be skin-tight. When the format of <span class="italic">6.5 Special</span> changed Faith became a resident on the revamped programme, <span class="italic">Drumbeat!</span>, performing rock and roll with the sullen look of the day. However, when he smiled wistfully he entered young girls' hearts and his singles made the charts.<br>
<br>&#145;What Do You Want&#146;, written by Johnny Worth (from <span class="italic">Drumbeat</span>'s resident vocal group, the Raindrops) and arranged by John Barry, was released by EMI's Parlophone label in November 1959. The presiding influence was Buddy Holly's &#145;It Doesn't Matter Anymore&#146;, with John Barry emulating its pizzicato strings. It topped the UK charts for three weeks. The team followed it with another number one, &#145;Poor Me&#146;, and a number two, &#145;Someone Else's Baby&#146;. The B-side of that third single, &#145;Big Time&#146;, about a London boy wanting to be successful, was written by Lionel Bart. Bart knew that making records was about communication: &#145;Adam had an incredible voice. He could just about make it as a singer but his voice was very distinctive, especially the way he said &#147;bay-beh&#148;. Everybody thought they could sing as well as he could, and that's why he made it&#146;  (private information). Fans copied Faith's brushed-forward hairstyle, and he appeared in a film set in Soho, <span class="italic">Beat Girl</span> (1960), although he subsequently called it &#145;a disastrous teenage exploitation movie which bore little or no relation to Soho or the youth it was supposed to represent&#146;  (private information). The score included an atmospheric top ten single, &#145;Made You&#146;, which was banned by the BBC for its sexual connotations. Faith showed his dramatic skills in <span class="italic">Never Let Go</span> (1960) and fans squirmed when a villainous Peter Sellers shut his hand in a car door.<br>
<br>In December 1960, against the advice of his management, Faith appeared on the BBC's interrogative television programme, <span class="italic">Face to Face</span>. It was anticipated that the host, John Freeman, would expose his shallowness, but Faith held his own, claimed that Dvo&#345;&aacute;k and Sibelius were his favourite composers and <span class="italic">The Catcher in the Rye</span> his favourite book, and, in an astonishing revelation for its time, not only admitted to pre-marital sex but said he enjoyed it. Faith commented:<blockquote>The BMA had a committee to look at the morals of today's youth and they asked me to appear before them. They thought I was the Voice of Youth but I could only speak for myself. It prompted the BBC to get Ludovic Kennedy to chair a discussion between myself and the Archbishop of York. The public was surprised that a working-class pop star could talk. (private information)</blockquote>Another reaction was even more surprising: Faith's parents got married so that they would not be an embarrassment to him.<br>
<br>Although he had a string of hit records, the quality of Faith's work was erratic. The nadir was his 1960 Christmas record, &#145;Lonely Pup (in a Christmas Shop)&#146;. He also rejected good material, including Lonnie Donegan's &#145;Have a Drink on Me&#146; and Mitch Murray's &#145;How Do You Do It?&#146; In 1962 Faith copied Eden Kane's hully-gully rhythm for the top ten single &#145;Don't That Beat All&#146;, but he was losing ground. At first he was outselling his new labelmates, the Beatles, but &#145;Baby Take a Bow&#146; was feeble compared with &#145;Love Me Do&#146;. He changed his style, working with a beat group, the Roulettes, and a new songwriter, Chris Andrews, in the hope of forestalling the inevitable decline. &#145;The First Time&#146; and &#145;We Are in Love&#146; were good examples of British beat and Andrews wrote an entire album for Faith, <span class="italic">On the Move</span> (1964). The same year Faith made his best record when he covered Burt Bacharach's &#145;Message to Martha&#146;, which became his last top twenty hit. Faith then moved into cabaret but hated it:<blockquote>I didn't think that I was giving value for money. The music, the clubs, the environment didn't appeal to me and there was no way I could do it justice. I told my manager, &#145;I'll work when I have to but I'm never going to sing again&#146;. (private information)</blockquote>Although Faith was a long way from being the best of Britain's rock and roll singers, he was easily the best actor among them. His performance alongside Donald Sinden in <span class="italic">Mix Me a Person</span> (1961) showed his potential, and in the late 1960s he went into repertory and learnt his craft. He was supported by the dancer Jacqueline (Jackie) Irving, whom he married on 19 August 1967. She was the daughter of William Henry Irving, aircraft skinner, and at the time of their marriage was aged twenty-four. Their son, Heathcliff, died within hours of being born; their daughter, Katya, was born in 1970. In 1968 Faith did well in a touring version of <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span> with Dame Sybil Thorndike. His performance as <span class="italic">Billy Liar</span> in the stage version of the film, in 1969, prompted its authors, Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, to create the television series <span class="italic">Budgie</span> (1971&#150;2), in which Faith played a small-time London crook living on his wits but always outmanoeuvred by Charlie Endell, played by Iain Cuthbertson. The phrase, &#145;Leave it out, Hazel&#146;, entered the language. In 1973 Faith suffered serious injuries in a car crash. He was told he would be left with a limp, but with typical resolve he regained his normal stance. The psychological effect was more damaging: apart from an appearance in the David Essex film <span class="italic">Stardust</span> (1974) he was reluctant to act for some years.<br>
<br>Faith was also successful as a manager. Dave Courtney, who had played drums for Faith, asked him to vet a contract for a new artist, Leo Sayer. When Faith heard Sayer's songs, he tore up the contract and said, &#145;Dave, you and I are going to manage this boy. He's too good to give to anybody else&#146;  (private information). To finance the venture, Faith negotiated a deal for a comeback album with Warner Brothers. He made <span class="italic">I Survive</span> (1974) with just half of his allocated budget (but with guest appearances from Paul and Linda McCartney) and used the remainder to finance Sayer. To save costs, Faith held business meetings in the tea-room at Fortnum and Mason's. Courtney and Faith produced Sayer's first hits&#151;&#145;The Show Must Go On&#146; and &#145;One Man Band&#146;&#151;at Roger Daltrey's studio, and Daltrey was so impressed that he recorded Sayer's &#145;Giving It All Away&#146;, a top ten record produced by Faith. Daltrey and Faith acted together in <span class="italic">McVicar</span> (1980). Faith eventually made more money from managing Sayer than he had from his own singing career, but the relationship ended in acrimony, Sayer suing Faith for mismanagement and winning large damages in an out-of-court settlement.<br>
<br>In 1978 Faith organized an all-star album, <span class="italic">Puttin' On the Style</span>, to resuscitate the career of his friend Lonnie Donegan. In 1983 he toured in a revival of <span class="italic">Alfie</span>, directed by Alan Parker. During the early 1980s he also presented the first video review programme, <span class="italic">Video Video</span>, for Channel 4, and conducted an affair with the tennis star Chris Evert, which almost wrecked his marriage. In 1986 he had open-heart surgery for blocked arteries, but he recovered quickly and the following year went into a West End musical, <span class="italic">Budgie</span> (based on the television series), which had been created for him. Its lyricist, Don Black, commented, &#145;When a musical doesn't work, it doesn't work and we never got the book right. It was too violent, and it was about abortions and the seedy low-life in Soho. People preferred <span class="italic">42nd Street</span> and the big blockbusters&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Faith gained something of a reputation for investing his money wisely, and by the late 1980s was writing financial columns for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and <span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span>. In one infamous column he claimed he could make anyone a millionaire in six months. With a financial adviser, Roger Levitt, he formed a company to look after the money of celebrity friends. Much to Faith's embarrassment, Levitt was arrested for fraud in 1990, and Faith himself was discredited and lost an estimated &pound;7 million. He lost further large sums in the Lloyd's insurance scandals of the early 1990s. In 1999 his digital station, the Money Channel, attracted few viewers. The station closed with debts of &pound;32 million and Faith was declared bankrupt in 2002.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Faith's acting career continued. In 1992&#150;4 he starred alongside Zo&euml; Wanamaker in the BBC drama series <span class="italic">Love Hurts</span>, which ran for three series. He said his character &#145;changed my relationship with the public. For the first time, they were looking at me as a man instead of a young pop kid who was growing old&#146;  (private information). A touring production of <span class="italic">A Chorus Line</span> was successful and he wrote his autobiography, <span class="italic">Acts of Faith</span>, in 1996. In 2002 he appeared in a BBC comedy series, <span class="italic">The House that Jack Built</span>, with Gillian Taylforth. He was touring in <span class="italic">Love and Marriage</span> and considering a further series of <span class="italic">Love Hurts</span> and concert appearances when he died from a heart attack at the North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on 8 March 2003. He was survived by his wife, Jackie, and daughter, Katya.<br>
