<span class="headword">Strathearn,  Malise</span>, sixth earl of Strathearn  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1261, <em>d.</em> in or before 1317), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was descended from a native Celtic family of considerable antiquity, whose members began to be styled earls of Strathearn in the early twelfth century. The best known of the early earls was Gilbert (<i>fl</i>. 1171&#150;1223) who, together with his wife, Matilda d'Aubigny, in 1198 founded a priory of Austin canons at Inchaffray; it became an abbey in 1220 or 1221.<br>
<br>The sixth earl of Strathearn was born <i>c</i>.1261, the son of Malise, the fifth earl, and the latter's wife, Matilda, daughter of Gilbert, earl of Orkney and Caithness. He became an important figure on the political stage during the wars of independence, and ultimately lost his title and lands as a consequence of the turmoil of that period. In 1284 he was one of thirty-nine magnates who accepted Alexander III's granddaughter, Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as heir-presumptive to the throne of Scotland. In 1290 he attended the parliament at Birgham which made arrangements for the marriage of the Maid to the prince of Wales, and he attested the treaty of Salisbury which confirmed those marriage plans some months later. In June 1291 he was one of the auditors for John de Balliol in the competition for the Scottish crown, and a month later he swore fealty to Edward I as lord superior of Scotland. He was also present in Berwick in the autumn of 1292, throughout the final stages of the proceedings of the Great Cause, and thereafter he threw in his lot with the Scots in their opposition to Edward I. In July 1295 he was present in the parliament held at Stirling which wrested the exercise of power from the hands of King John, subsequently acting as one of a council of twelve who assumed governance of Scotland in place of the deposed king, setting his seal to the confirmation of the Scoto-French treaty negotiated as one of the first acts of the new council. In the spring of 1296 he took part in an expedition to Carlisle.<br>
<br>Strathearn submitted to the English king after the conquest of Scotland in 1296. He was restored to his possessions, but was compelled to send two of his sons to the Tower as hostages for his good behaviour. Reverting temporarily to the Scottish cause in the years 1297&#150;1303, he was once again in the allegiance of Edward I in 1303, and for the next three years served the English king, though not very energetically. Earl Malise's political troubles began in earnest in the summer of 1306 when he was taken prisoner by the English, probably soon after the battle of Methven in June, and sent to confinement in Rochester Castle. The following summer he was permitted to present a memorial to the English council explaining his alleged support of the rebel Robert Bruce. He claimed that in March 1306 he had been captured and compelled under pain of death to perform homage to Bruce, but in spite of his protestations of loyalty the earl remained in custody. He was sent to York Castle in November 1307 and his son and heir was detained as a hostage. The earl was not finally released until November 1308, and forbidden until 1310 to return to Scotland, subsequently receiving a pension and gifts from the English king. Strathearn demonstrated his ultimate loyalty by joining the English garrison in Perth in 1312, where he helped to defend the town against assault by King Robert in 1313. Ironically, his heir fought on the side of the Scots at this siege, and the old earl was taken captive there by his son. Although his life was spared by Bruce, he was compelled to resign his earldom in favour of his son.<br>
<br>Strathearn married Agnes, possibly a member of the Comyn family, and probably the same countess of Strathearn who, according to Fordun, was accused in the parliament of 1320 of having taken part in the conspiracy to assassinate King Robert. They had four children. The sixth earl was dead by 1317 (when his eldest son, and successor, Malise, was noted as having been &#145;in the king's peace&#146;) and he was buried in Inchaffray Abbey.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26651"></a><span class="headword">Malise Strathearn</span>, seventh earl of Strathearn  (1275<span class="mult">x</span>80&#150;1328<span class="mult">x</span>30)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded his father as earl soon after the siege of Perth of 1313. Unlike his father he remained firmly committed to the Scottish patriotic cause. In 1320 he was one of eight earls and over thirty barons whose seals were appended to the declaration of Arbroath, a petition addressed to the pope in which the independence of Scotland was vigorously asserted. He was not implicated in the conspiracy of that year to assassinate Robert Bruce, though his mother, Agnes, was condemned and convicted. Little is known of his career. The last certain mention of him occurs in a royal charter of 28 July 1328, and he was dead by 1329 or 1330, when his son and heir, another Malise, succeeded to the title of earl of Orkney and Caithness (through his great-grandmother Matilda), as well as of Strathearn. The seventh earl married twice. The identity of his first wife is unknown, but she was the mother of his two children, Malise, the eighth earl, and Maria. His second wife was Joanna, daughter of Sir John Menteith, who survived her husband by many years, and eventually became countess of Strathearn again, by marriage to a subsequent earl, Maurice Murray of Drumsagard.<br>
<br>The accounts of previous historians of Strathearn have hopelessly confused the later history of the native earldom. It was the eighth earl who fought on the Scottish side at the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, but later resigned his earldom into the hands of Edward Balliol. In June 1344 he was tried before David II in a parliament held at Scone and, although acquitted of treasonable intent, was never restored to the earldom of Strathearn. That title had been granted in 1343 to Maurice Murray of Drumsagard, with whom it remained until 1346.<br>
