<span class="headword">Coke,  Thomas</span>, earl of Leicester  (1697&#150;1759), <span class="occ">politician, architect, and art collector</span>, was born on 17 June 1697, the eldest of the five children of Edward Coke (1676/8&#150;1707), landowner, and his wife, Carey (1680&#150;1707), the daughter of Sir John Newton, third baronet, of Barr's Court, Gloucestershire. The Cokes were a thriving gentry family in Norfolk whose considerable estate in the north of the county around Holkham had been established by Sir Edward Coke, James I's eminent chief justice. In 1671 the estate, comprising more than 1800 acres, was inherited by Robert Coke (<i>c</i>.1651&#150;1679), Thomas's grandfather, who belonged to the younger branch of the dynasty, settled at Thorington, Suffolk, and served as MP for King's Lynn.<br>
<br>In April 1707 Coke's father died, followed by his mother a few months later. Until Thomas Coke came of age in 1718 four relatives acted as his guardians and ran the estates conscientiously. Besides its large nucleus in Norfolk, the Coke estate consisted of lands and property in Suffolk, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Staffordshire, Dorset, Kent, Somerset, and London. Prudent management and increased rents not only overcame the large debts left by his father but also enabled young Coke to embark in 1712 at the age of fifteen on a prolonged grand tour, one that would later prove to have made arguably the most artistically profound impact on an English student&#150;traveller. Under the tutelage of Thomas Hobart, a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, Coke had already developed a passion for classical antiquity. Accompanied by Hobart, he travelled extensively in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the Habsburg empire, but it was classical Italy, especially Rome, that made the deepest impression. Coke saw himself as a young &#145;virtuoso&#146; and spent liberally on rare books, manuscripts, paintings, drawings, and sculpture, as well as commissioning new works from contemporary artists. At Rome in 1714 he began taking instruction in the rudiments of architecture and draughtsmanship from the architect Giacomo Matiari, and during one of these sessions was introduced to William Kent, who at the time was still pursuing a painter's vocation. Over the next few years a lasting friendship grew from their architectural sightseeing excursions together to various parts of Italy, with Kent often acting as Coke's agent in the purchase of works of art.<br>
<br>Coke returned to England in May 1718, and a month later, on coming of age, acquired control of estates that by then were yielding about &pound;10,000 a year, making him one of the richest commoners in Britain. On 3 July he married Lady Margaret Tufton [<a name="cosubject_96151"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Coke</span>, countess of Leicester and <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Clifford  (1700&#150;1775)], the third surviving daughter and coheir of Thomas Tufton, sixth earl of Thanet (1644&#150;1729). The match had been arranged by his guardians primarily for the valuable social and financial benefits it would bring. Lady Margaret's marriage portion of &pound;15,000 was used to defray the portions of Coke's two recently married sisters (&pound;5000 in both cases), thus leaving untouched the estate and the income it provided. Their only surviving child, a son, Edward, was born in February 1719; two more children, born in 1721 and 1723, died in infancy. Coke nevertheless continued the dissolute ways he had fallen into while abroad, and was known to have resumed his debaucheries within six months of marriage. Margaret Coke&#151;&#145;a very agreeable and good lady&#146;&#151;quietly tolerated her husband's persistent and open infidelity, tending to shy away from society. In 1737 he was reported to be involved &#145;with several ladies of quality and fashion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 2.392&#150;3), and had lately been the subject of gossip on account of having lost to Lord Chesterfield in their rivalry for the affections of Lady Frances, a daughter of Robert Shirley, first Earl Ferrers.<br>
<br>Coke quickly ruined the exemplary financial condition in which his estates had been handed over to him in 1718. Heavy expenditure, including large gambling losses, landed him in debt amounting to &pound;15,000 by 1720. His hopes for a quick solution to these difficulties led him to speculate disastrously during the South Sea Bubble; the South Sea stock on which he laid out &pound;48,900 resold for only &pound;10,971. Not until the mid-nineteenth century would the Cokes feel confident again to invest significantly in the stock market. In the years that followed the crash Coke learned to live within his annual income of &pound;10,000 or more, paying large sums of interest on his debts without drastically curtailing the lifestyle and expenditure of a gentleman of large estate. His high-spirited, boisterous nature was too deeply ingrained to keep him from the gaming table, the chase, the cockfighting arena, or from adding to his magnificent collections of art, manuscripts, and books.<br>
<br>Coke chose to enter parliament at the general election of 1722, and was elected unopposed as knight of the shire for Norfolk. In the Commons he naturally supported his near neighbour, friend, and distant relative Robert Walpole, now one of the king's principal ministers, and in 1725 Walpole ensured that Coke was one of the wealthy commoners appointed knights of the newly created Order of the Bath. At court Coke became well known on account of his cultural interests and friendship with Kent, who by now was employed on various commissions in the royal residences. In May 1728 he was elevated to the peerage, as Baron Lovel of Minster Lovel, after his manorial property in Oxfordshire, though there was also dynastic affectation in his revival of this medieval barony. He felt, however, that he and his estate were worthy of an earldom, or at least a viscountcy, and confided to Lord Chesterfield in 1730 that since he always voted for the court in parliament &#145;I expect to be paid for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.10). He was introduced in the Lords on 25 February 1729. Already a freemason by the early 1720s, he served as grand master of the grand lodge of England during 1731&#150;2. His quest for pecuniary reward was eventually answered in 1733 when he was appointed joint postmaster-general, the proceeds of which brought him about &pound;1000 a year. He was to hold this office for the rest of his life, exercising control over an important branch of local patronage throughout the country. A further reward came when Lady Lovel became a peeress in her own right in 1734, when the abeyance of the medieval barony of Clifford, which had been held by her father, was terminated in her favour. But although he enjoyed close social and sporting companionship with leading ministers and courtiers, and spoke fairly frequently in the Lords on some of the most important topics of the day, he was never regarded as material suitable for high ministerial office. Lord Hervey complained in 1729 that Lovel currently basked undeservedly as &#145;the darling idol of the wits&#146;  (Ilchester, 41&#150;2), and it was this delight in social attention that he grandly exhibited at Holkham, with its convenient proximity to Walpole's Houghton, and where as part of the entertainment he would seek to impress ministerial friends and guests with his vision of a sumptuous new house in his barren corner of Norfolk.<br>
<br>Lovel seems to have conceived the notion of one day building a classically styled mansion at Holkham while he was still on his grand tour. But the recovery of his finances meant that he could proceed only gradually, and work on the house did not begin until 1734. He had begun in the 1720s by sheltering the intended site from the bitter North Sea winds by planting extensive woodland. He also made considerable progress in landscaping the vicinity of the house, commissioning William Kent to design the obelisk, triumphal arch, and temple, although some of his visitors doubted whether such an inhospitable coastal area of dunes and salt marshes was suitable for country house-building. Lovel's plans for the mansion itself had been perfected over a long period. Initially he envisaged a rectangular block in simple but distinctive neo-Palladian style, the drawings for which were produced under his close supervision by his Norwich-born clerk of works, Matthew Brettingham. In due course this was elaborated by the addition of four connecting &#145;pavilions&#146; at each corner, designed by Kent, to accommodate the family apartments, while the central block or <i>corps de logis</i> would contain the state rooms and Lovel's collections of art and books. Lovel also worked on his design in close consultation with the earl of Burlington, the leading exponent of Palladianism, whose villa at Chiswick, completed in 1729, Burlington himself had designed.<br>
<br>Holkham has previously been regarded entirely as the work of William Kent, following assertions by Horace Walpole, while others have accepted Brettingham's claim to have been the principal architect. But scholars are now convinced that though both Kent and Brettingham were much involved, it was Lovel himself who masterminded the final design, habitually intervening, amending, and redrawing. On completion of the first pavilion during 1740&#150;41, Lovel was at last able to move from his cramped Elizabethan manor house nearby, Hill Hall. Holkham would not in fact be completed until after Lovel's death, but visitors who came to see its progress marvelled at the achievement and its promise as one of the most splendid new country houses in England. Lovel was never in easy financial circumstances, but remained undeterred by immense debts and large building costs. In order to press on with construction he sold off much land outside Norfolk, while also maintaining his policy to buy up property that would augment the Holkham estate. The effect of this, however, was serious depopulation in his locality, and towards the end of his life he lamented that he had swallowed up so many of his neighbours that the nearest one remaining was the king of Denmark.<br>
<br>In May 1744 Lovel was advanced to the coveted earldom, but caused a minor furore in snapping up the title of Leicester, another title of medieval origin, which had only recently become extinct in the Sidney family. The dynastic vision that lay behind his peerage and the construction of Holkham was shattered, however, in 1753 upon the death of his heir, Viscount Coke. Coke had turned out even more dissolute than his father and his marriage on 1 April 1747 to Lady Mary Campbell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68372/', "Coke, Lady Mary")</script>], a daughter of the second duke of Argyll, quickly ended in their separation. Leicester withdrew from society for a while, much concerned at the toll his wife's grief was taking on her, and feeling unable to recover his spirits until she had recovered hers. In subsequent years, finding himself out of place in fashionable London society, he dedicated himself with renewed determination and vigour to the completion of Holkham, while the constant stream of guests and visitors could count on the generous hospitality of &#145;the fat, laughing, joking peer &hellip; whose taste for building is so elegant that it is far beyond conception or description&#146; (Admiral Edward Boscawen, 1757, quoted in James, 273). He died at Holkham Hall on 20 April 1759 and was buried in the Coke ancestral vault at Tittleshall church some 20 miles south. In accordance with his will, the entire estate passed to his wife to whom he also left detailed instructions for the completion of the mansion. By 1765 the dowager countess had dutifully fulfilled this wish. She died on 28 February 1775. Thomas Coke's Holkham has survived almost entirely unchanged and is widely acknowledged as the finest Palladian mansion constructed in eighteenth-century England.<br>
