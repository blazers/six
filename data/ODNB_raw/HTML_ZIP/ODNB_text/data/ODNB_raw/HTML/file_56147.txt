<span class="headword">Needham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Moyle]</span>,  Dorothy Mary</span>  (1896&#150;1987), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born in London on 22 September 1896, one of the three daughters (there was also a son) of John Thomas Moyle, a civil servant at the Patent Office, and his wife, Ellen Daves. Dorothy was educated in Cheshire at Claremont College, Stockport, a private school run by her aunt, and at St Hilary's, Alderley Edge. She entered Girton College, Cambridge, in 1915. After graduation in 1919, she began research, supported by a grant from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, under Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins at the Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry, Cambridge. Hopkins, having worked with Sir Walter Fletcher on lactic acid in muscle, interested Dorothy in the biochemistry of muscle contraction. She won the Gamble prize at Girton College in 1924 for an essay on the structure, function, and chemical constitution of different types of striated muscle. In 1925&#150;8 she was a Beit memorial medical research fellow, gaining her PhD in 1926.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1924 Dorothy Moyle married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58035/', "(No&#235;l) Joseph Terence Montgomery Needham (1900&#150;1995)")</script> with whom she had a close affinity in ideas and attitudes. There were no children of the marriage, a fact which served to deepen their relationship and their many shared interests, especially an unshakeable commitment to Christianity and socialism. They rarely collaborated in research, except during summer vacations spent in marine biology laboratories where they micro-injected amoebae and sea-urchin eggs with pH and rH indicators to determine the reaction of the cytoplasm.<br>
<br>Between 1928 and 1940 Dorothy Needham taught widely both at Cambridge, where she gave advanced lectures on muscle biochemistry, and in America, France, Belgium, and other countries. Her most important research work dates from this period when O. Meyerhof, O. Warburg, and she, independently, elucidated the chemical changes by which glucose is broken down in the cell to yield the energy-rich compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). She also studied the roles of pyruvic, succinic, and lactic acids, and transamination. Her influence in the Cambridge laboratory was profound, largely owing to her sympathetic gentleness combined with penetrating intelligence and a quiet sense of humour. She was affectionately known as Dophi to those who worked closely with her and who often remained her lifelong friends. Among her numerous post-graduate research students, some later attained high academic positions.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Dorothy Needham was a member of the chemical defence group led by Professor Malcolm Dixon for the Ministry of Supply. In 1940&#150;43 she worked on the effects of chemical weapons such as mustard gas on the metabolism of skin and bone marrow. She was also a member of the Biochemical Society committee (1941&#150;3). In 1944 she accompanied her husband to Chungking (Chongqing), China, where he was appointed scientific counsellor at the British embassy and she was associate director of the Sino-British co-operation office which he established. During this period she contracted tuberculosis from which she only slowly recovered after her return to the Sir William Dunn Institute in 1945. She was awarded the ScD degree at Cambridge in that year and in 1948 was elected FRS, one of the earliest women fellows. Joseph Needham had been elected in 1941 and Dorothy's election made the Needhams the Royal Society's first married couple.<br>
<br>Despite her academic distinction Dorothy Needham never held a pensionable post in the biochemical laboratory, but throughout her working life she received numerous research grants from various national bodies. During 1946&#150;52 she worked on enzyme biochemistry on a grant from the Medical Research Council; afterwards, until 1955, she received a grant from the Broodbank Fund of Cambridge University. This was followed by work on smooth muscle for the Agricultural Research Council in 1955&#150;62. She also received a Foulerton gift donation from the Royal Society in 1961&#150;2 and a Leverhulme award in 1963, the year in which she retired after forty years spent in active research.<br>
<br>From 1967 Dorothy Needham devoted herself to writing her <i>magnum opus</i>; entitled <span class="italic">Machina carnis</span>, it was a historical account of studies in the biochemistry of muscular contraction. Published in 1971, this book represented the culmination of her life's work on the link between the uptake of oxygen and the binding of phosphates in energy-rich bonds in muscle tissue and it remains a unique and authoritative contribution to the history of muscle biochemistry. In 1972 she collaborated with Dr E. B&uuml;lbring in organizing for the Royal Society the first British symposium on the chemistry and physiology of smooth muscle. At the time of her death she was working with Mikul&aacute;&#353; Teich on a documentary history of biochemistry which was published in 1991.<br>
<br>Dorothy Needham was an honorary fellow of three Cambridge colleges: at Lucy Cavendish College, which she was instrumental in establishing, she became a foundation fellow in 1965; at Girton, her own college, she became an honorary fellow in 1976; and at Gonville and Caius College, where Joseph Needham was master for eleven years (1965&#150;76), she became an honorary fellow in 1979. As the wife of the master and hostess at the events and festivities held in the master's lodge, she was deeply appreciated by many members of Caius, both senior and junior. Her fellowship there pleased her greatly; she was the first woman to be admitted and was, for a long time, the only woman fellow.<br>
<br>Dorothy Needham's chief hobby and relaxation was painting in watercolours and her travels all over the world provided opportunities for recording scenes and events which she experienced. Paying tribute to her in November 1988, Joseph Needham said, &#145;she retained a certain innocence, and a complete freedom from worldliness&#146;. This was echoed by many of her students, who loved her for her qualities of kindness, warmth, and patience, while admiring her keen intelligence and strength of mind. In retirement, after leaving Caius in 1976, she began to show the early signs of Alzheimer's disease and very gradually she declined. She died peacefully at her home, 42 Grange Road, Cambridge, on 22 December 1987, at the age of ninety-one. The funeral service was held on 31 December at Caius College chapel, followed by cremation.<br>
