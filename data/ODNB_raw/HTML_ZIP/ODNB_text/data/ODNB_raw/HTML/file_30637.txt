<span class="headword">Bates,  Cadwallader John</span>  (1853&#150;1902), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Kensington Gate, London, on 14 January 1853, the eldest son of Thomas Bates (1810&#150;1882) and his first wife, Emily (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of John Batten of Thorn Falcon, Somerset. His father, of Aydon White House and Heddon, Northumberland, was a barrister who had been a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, from 1834 to 1849. The Bates family had been established in Northumberland since the fourteenth century, but through his mother Bates was a kinsman of Cadwallader, twelfth Lord Blayney of Gregynog (extinct 1874), after whom he was named. He was at Eton College from 1866 but left after two years because of weak eyesight, which was to trouble him throughout his life. In 1869 he proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, but poor sight led to his being awarded an <i>aegrotat</i> in the moral sciences tripos of 1871. He proceeded MA in 1875. Between 1871 and 1882 he travelled much abroad, especially in Germany and Poland, where two of his uncles had lived for many years, in particular Edward Bates, who lived at Schloss Cl&ouml;den, Brandenburg, Prussia. In 1882, having inherited this Prussian property, he succeeded to the family estates in Northumberland, to the family interest in the Heddon colliery, and to Kirklevington, near Yarm, Yorkshire. He invested in land in Silesia and had family interests in Wittenberg. Although his interests were mainly scholarly, he had a practical knowledge of farming and mastered the intricacies of the herd-book to rebuild partially the celebrated Kirklevington shorthorn herd, dispersed in 1850, of his great-uncle Thomas Bates, whose biography he published in 1897.<br>
<br>In 1882 Cadwallader Bates bought Langley Castle, near Haydon Bridge, from the commissioners of the Greenwich Hospital estates and spent large sums on restoring it, using the Durham architect C. Hodgson Fowler. As magistrate and deputy lieutenant, Bates took his full share of county business in Northumberland, and was high sheriff in 1890. His enduring contribution to county life lay, however, in his historical work, especially on the medieval history of Northumbria. In <span class="italic">Border Holds</span> (1891), the first but only volume published of a detailed study of Northumberland castles, he showed keen observation and documentary accuracy on a subject much burdened with legend. Twenty-seven castles and towers were discussed, but no sequel was published. A concise <span class="italic">History of Northumberland</span> (1895), more popular in tone, raised standards in his day. Bates was active as a promoter of the collaborative <span class="italic">History of Northumberland</span>, and made contributions to its first six volumes (1893&#150;1902). He was a vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne and, from 1880, a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span>. He was deeply read in Christian origins and medieval hagiography, and left some unfinished studies of St Patrick and St Gildas. Attracted by its difficulty, he took up the history of the Paschal controversy and likewise left several studies on the subject.<br>
<br>In 1893, while on a visit to Austrian Poland, Bates was received into the Uniate Church. On 3 September 1895 he married Josephine (<i>d</i>. 1933), second daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob d'Echarvine, of Tailloires, Savoy; there were no children. Bates's indefatigable historical labours told on his health, and he died at his home at Langley Castle of heart failure on 18 March 1902; he was buried in the castle grounds. A collection of his letters, spirited in expression and displaying wide learning in local antiquities, was published in 1906.<br>
