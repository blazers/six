<span class="headword">Duckworth,  Gerald L'&Eacute;tang</span>  (1870&#150;1937), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 29 October 1870, probably in London, five weeks after the death of his father, Herbert Duckworth (1833&#150;1870). Herbert was a barrister whose family were landed gentry from the county of Somerset. His mother, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson (1846&#150;1895), had aristocratic connections and her aunts included Julia Margaret Cameron, the well-known photographer, and Sarah Prinsep, mother of the painter Valentine Prinsep. Gerald was his mother's favourite, a delicate and petted child who liked to write to her in baby language. His elder brother, George Herbert Duckworth (1868&#150;1934), was at one time private secretary to Austen Chamberlain and was knighted in 1927; he married Lady Margaret Herbert (1870&#150;1958), daughter of the fourth earl of Carnarvon, with whom he had three sons. His sister Stella (1869&#150;1897) died just three months after marrying John Waller Hills (<i>d</i>. 1938).<br>
<br>Gerald's mother remarried in 1878. Her new husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Leslie Stephen")</script>, was to become well known through his editorship of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> (1882&#150;91). Together Leslie and Julia had four children, two boys, Thoby (1880&#150;1906) and Adrian (1883&#150;1948), and two girls, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30694/', "Vanessa Bell (1879&#150;1961)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37018/', "Virginia Woolf (1882&#150;1941)")</script>. Over the years the family divided their time between 22 Hyde Park Gate in London, and Talland House at St Ives in Cornwall. Gerald did not take kindly to his stepbrothers and stepsisters and was not above telling tales on the Stephen children, mocking them with his sneering, teasing, and treacherous laughter. Virginia Woolf's diaries suggest that both he and his brother sexually molested her over a period of years, starting when she was just six years old  (Schulkind).<br>
<br>Duckworth, like his brother and stepfather, was educated at Eton College and then went on to Clare College, Cambridge, but he was not given to hard work, preferring instead the pleasures of the stomach and the delights of London nightlife. Virginia Woolf likened him to &#145;a pampered overfed pug dog with white hair, hardly a gleam of life, let alone intelligence in his eye&#146; and &#145;with no opinions, merely a seaweed drift in the prevailing current&#146;  (King, 242).<br>
<br>In 1898 Duckworth decided to go into publishing, apparently believing it to be an occupation suitable for a gentleman. Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. was established at Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, and A. R. Waller, a literary adviser and bookman, left the firm of J. M. Dent to join the company. The first list included Leslie Stephen's Ford lectures, <span class="italic">English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1898); a translation of August Strindberg's <span class="italic">Der Fater</span> (<span class="italic">The Father</span>, 1899); Henry James's <span class="italic">In the Cage</span> (1898); and <span class="italic">Jocelyn</span> (1898) by the unknown John Sinjohn, an early pseudonym of John Galsworthy.<br>
<br>It was at Waller's instigation that Galsworthy's fiction was published by Duckworth, though Gerald, a lifelong friend of the author, did turn down <span class="italic">The Man of Property</span> (1906)&#151;the first of the novels that were to become <span class="italic">The Forsyte Saga</span> (1922)&#151;with the words &#145;Stick to plays, my man, stick to plays&#146;. Duckworth published all of Galsworthy's plays over a period of twenty years from 1909, and in 1929 produced a limited omnibus edition. Much to his horror, Galsworthy was required to sign all 1250 copies. On being told however that he would receive a royalty of 15<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. on each copy, he placed his watch on the table and said: &#145;It will be interesting to see how long it takes me to earn &pound;984 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.&#146;  (Beare, 103&#150;7).<br>
<br>Despite Virginia Woolf's antipathy to her stepbrother, it was Duckworth &amp; Co. that published her first two novels. She rewrote <span class="italic">The Voyage Out</span> several times before submitting it, but Edward Garnett, who had joined the company in 1901 as a reader, was enthusiastic, and the book was published in 1915. Her second book, <span class="italic">Night and Day</span>, came out in 1919 and Woolf recorded her feelings, saying that <blockquote>I thought of my novel destined to be pawed and snored over by him &hellip; I don't like the Club man's view of literature &hellip; [yet] I can't think of stout smooth Gerald smoking a cigar over my pages without a smile. (King, 243)</blockquote>On 2 March 1921 Duckworth married Cecil Alice Scott-Chad (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), the daughter of Charles Scott-Chad, a barrister. Virginia Woolf commented that he would either marry &#145;an older woman for money or a younger, sexually inexperienced woman for the same purpose&#146;  (King, 290). The marriage proved childless. Duckworth's publishing venture, however, prospered. Edward Garnett, considered by many to be the greatest reader of his time, stayed for nearly twenty years. He brought a number of authors to the firm including W. H. Hudson, Charles M. Doughty, and D. H. Lawrence. He initiated the <span class="roman">Popular Library of Art</span> series (1902) which included volumes on D. G. Rossetti, and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the <span class="roman">Studies in Theology</span> series (1907).<br>
<br>Thomas Balston joined the company in 1921 and became a partner in 1923. His interest in avant-garde literature was reflected in the firm's publications of Evelyn Waugh and practically everything produced by Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell. He left Duckworth ten years later having never forgiven the company for the loss of Waugh's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall</span> which had happened while he was away on holiday. The following year, 1924, the firm became a limited company.<br>
<br>Anthony Powell joined as literary editor in 1926 and in his novel <span class="italic">What's become of Waring?</span> (1939) the publishing firm of Judkins and Judkins is based on Duckworth's. Powell said that Gerald's interest in books, as far as reading was concerned, &#145;was as slender as that of any man I have ever encountered&#146;. As for his appearance, he was at this time &#145;a big, burly man with a slight grey moustache, small baleful eyes behind steel spectacles, a vaguely dissatisfied air and he moved gloomily through the office, a haze of port-fumes and stale cigar-smoke in his wake&#146;  (Garnett, 198).<br>
<br>Duckworth died on 28 September 1937 while on holiday in Milan. Apart from his publishing interests he was honorary secretary of the Savile Club and was remembered for his considerable zest and skill at billiards. E. Phillips Oppenheim, a popular fiction writer, described Duckworth as having a &#145;severe smile and a rather school mastery air which disappeared suddenly when he heard a familiar voice&#146;  (Phillips Oppenheim, 195). Of the few people who had a good word for him, Leonard Woolf said that he had found him to be &#145;a kindly, uncensorious man&#146;  (Garnett, 198). His publishing company continued to prosper and in 1969 it moved to a spacious Victorian building in Camden Town which was once owned by the piano makers Collard and Collard. It successfully celebrated its centenary in 1998.<br>
