<span class="headword">Orde, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1751&#150;1824), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born on 22 December 1751 at Nunnykirk, Morpeth, the youngest of three sons of John Orde (<i>c</i>.1704&#150;<i>c</i>.1786) of East Orde and Morpeth. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20811/', "Thomas Orde-Powlett, first Lord Bolton")</script>, was young John's brother, both being the sons of Anne (<i>d</i>. 1788), their father's second wife, daughter of Ralph Marr of Morpeth and widow of the Revd Pye.<br>
<br>Orde is thought to have attended grammar school at Morpeth before entering the navy in 1766 on the <i>Jersey</i>, bearing the broad pennant of Commodore Richard Spry, officer commanding the Mediterranean station. After further service on the Newfoundland and Jamaica stations he was promoted lieutenant of the sloop <i>Ferret</i> in 1773 by Sir George Rodney before returning home in the <i>Rainbow</i> the following year. After travel in France, in 1775 he sailed for America at the outbreak of the American War of Independence in the <i>Roebuck</i> with Captain Andrew Snape Hamond.<br>
<br>In early 1776 Orde was captured and held for a short period during the evacuation of the governor of Virginia, the earl of Dunmore, to Gwynn Island. At the time of his capture Orde had been leading an advance party under a flag of truce onto Gwynn Island to deliver a proclamation and negotiate a ceasefire and surrender. He became first lieutenant in August 1776 after that officer, M. S. Leake, was killed in the combined offensive launched on New York when a squadron, including the <i>Roebuck</i>, ran the gauntlet of a barrage of fire from onshore batteries. Early in 1777 Lord Howe appointed Orde first lieutenant of his flagship, the <i>Eagle</i>, and soon afterwards he promoted him commander of the sloop <i>Zebra</i>, in which command he assisted in the reduction of both Philadelphia and the forts of Delaware, for which, in May 1778, he was made post captain with command of the frigate <i>Virginia</i>. In the summer of 1779 the <i>Virginia</i> led Sir George Collier's squadron up the Penobscot River in pursuit of Commodore Saltonstall's expeditionary force which was advancing on Fort MacLean. When caught, the Americans ran for the shore and there set fire to all but one of their ships.<br>
<br>In 1780 Orde took part in the reduction of Charlestown. In a combined naval and military offensive Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot's squadron, including the <i>Virginia</i>, succeeded in clearing the estuary by forcing a passage through the gut guarded by the well-defended Fort Moultrie, the chief defence of the town. Arbuthnot afterwards singled out six officers for commendation, including Orde, who had taken Mount Pleasant with a contingent of 500 seamen, after which Fort Moultrie had quickly capitulated. At the close of the campaign he was given command of the <i>Chatham</i>, in which he captured the <i>General Washington</i>, and then, on 14 April 1781, the <i>Confederacy</i>. In July he sailed for London as Arbuthnot's flag-captain. In April of that year he had married Margaret Emma (1759&#150;1790), daughter of Richard Stevens of St Helena, Charlestown; the couple had one child who died in infancy.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Orde remained first in the North Sea and then off the coast of France, until, in February 1783, he was appointed governor of Dominica, restored to Great Britain under the peace of Versailles. There his primary objectives were to develop the harbour in Prince Rupert's Bay, restore law and order among the quarrelsome white, black, and Carib population, and retain the island for the British. In all this he was largely successful, so much so that he was rewarded with a baronetcy in 1790, though proceedings were later taken against him by the colonial assembly over his plans for funding improvements to the harbour and fortifications. The privy council dismissed the allegation as &#145;frivolous&#146;. With the onset of the war with France in 1793 Orde returned to naval duties. He served in the <i>Victorious</i>, the <i>Venerable</i>, and the <i>Prince George</i>, and then, on 1 June 1795, moved out of the <i>Prince George</i> on being raised to the rank of rear-admiral of the white in a general promotion. William Dillon described him at this time as &#145;tall, well-limbed [and] &hellip; of a haughty disposition&#146;  (Dillon, 1.188, 191), while James Ralfe assessed him as &#145;firm, cool, kind, dignified, with a noble prepossessing appearance finished by high good breeding&#146;  (Ralfe, 2.78&#150;80).<br>
<br>Orde was appointed to temporary command at Plymouth in March 1797, but then, in recognition of his success in suppressing mutinous elements there, he was moved to Portsmouth to preside over the courts martial of the more serious mutineers at the Nore. That autumn he hoisted his flag in the <i>Princess Royal</i> and joined the Mediterranean Fleet standing off the Tagus as third in command to Lord St Vincent. After a winter of successful blockade duty at Cadiz, Orde was bitterly disappointed to learn that the more junior Horatio Nelson had been given command of an independent squadron to hunt down and destroy Napoleon's expeditionary force. This was followed on 24 May 1798 by the arrival of reinforcements under Sir Roger Curtis. Orde was thus relegated to fourth in command. A childish squabble then arose between himself and St Vincent concerning a complaint written to St Vincent which he wrongly attributed to Orde and which permanently soured their relationship. St Vincent ordered Orde to strike his flag and return to England in the <i>Blenheim</i>. On his return Orde's request that St Vincent be court-martialled was refused; however, the Admiralty gave St Vincent a written reprimand. Orde turned down an offer of employment with the Channel Fleet. Rather, he chose to wait for the arrival of St Vincent in October 1799 and demand satisfaction. However, word of Orde's intention reached Lord Spencer and both Orde and St Vincent were bound over to keep the peace and then forbidden by the king to accept any challenge.<br>
<br>Orde was promoted vice-admiral on 14 February 1799, but remained unemployed until St Vincent's removal as first lord. In the autumn of 1804 he was given command of a squadron formed to strengthen the British presence off Cadiz now that Spain had entered the war. However, although he mounted a most efficient blockade which kept the Spanish fleet in harbour throughout that winter, many complaints emanated from Nelson in the Mediterranean about Orde's policing of the strait and Nelson's lost opportunity to obtain prize money. Weary of his task, Orde made a written request that he should be allowed to retire home. However, soon afterwards Villeneuve escaped through the Strait of Gibraltar and sailed for Cadiz, where Orde's squadron lay at anchor. Outnumbered, and complying with standing orders, Orde skilfully withdrew to join the Channel Fleet off Ushant. His dispatches to London were the first to divine Napoleon's plan that Villeneuve should draw off the Channel Fleet by sailing west and then return to escort his army of invasion across the channel.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1805 Orde was promoted admiral of the blue, in October 1809 of the white, and in June 1814 of the red. A professed admirer of Nelson, his admiration was probably not reciprocated although he acted as a pallbearer at Nelson's funeral. After the death of his first wife in 1790 Orde married Jane (<i>c</i>.1773&#150;1829), daughter of John Frere; the couple had five children, including a son, John Powlett Orde, who was to inherit the baronetcy on his father's death. In 1807 Orde became MP for the Yarmouth division of the Isle of Wight. This followed the death of his brother Lord Bolton and the elevation of Bolton's son, the then sitting MP, to the peerage. Orde represented the seat until 1812. He died at his home, 20 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, on 19 February 1824 after a long and painful illness. He was buried at Hanwell parish church, Middlesex, and was survived by his wife, who died on 16 September 1829.<br>
