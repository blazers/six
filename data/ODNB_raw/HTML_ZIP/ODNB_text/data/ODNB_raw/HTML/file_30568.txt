<span class="headword">Banbury,  Frederick George</span>, first Baron Banbury of Southam  (1850&#150;1936), <span class="occ">politician and stockbroker</span>, was born in London on 2 December 1850, the eldest son of Frederick Banbury of Shirley House, Surrey, and his wife, Cecilia Laura, daughter of William Cox of Woodford Hall, Essex. He was educated at Winchester College and afterwards abroad. In 1872 he was elected a member of the stock exchange and from 1879 until his retirement in 1906 was head of the firm of Frederick Banbury &amp; Sons, stockbrokers; the firm was known for arranging foreign loans. At the general election of 1892 he was elected as a Conservative for the Peckham division of Camberwell, and he retained that seat until heavily defeated in 1906. In June 1906 he was returned unopposed at a by-election for the City of London and retained his seat until he entered the House of Lords in January 1924 as Baron Banbury of Southam in Warwickshire. In 1903 he was created a baronet and he was sworn of the privy council in 1916.<br>
<br>Although Banbury never held ministerial office, he made for himself a unique position as an opponent of legislation which appeared to him unnecessary and of change which he did not regard as progress. This was facilitated by his ability to talk at any length at any moment on any subject; unembarrassed by other MPs' complaints, he talked out many a clause and many a bill. He declared that in his opinion there was too much legislation and he generally opposed bills proposed by private members. His opposition prevented trams being allowed to cross London's bridges. His long experience in the City made him an able critic of finance bills, on which he was an undoubted authority, and a ferociously effective member of the public accounts committee, of which he was for a time chairman, and during the 1905&#150;15 Liberal government he energetically exposed corruption. He was a member of the select committee on the Marconi scandal (1912&#150;13) and of that on national expenditure (1919&#150;20). He earned esteem by his technical knowledge, and his criticism of his own party was seldom resented. A master of House of Commons procedure, he was dextrous in raising points of order.<blockquote>Punctual in his attendance, he came to be regarded in his corner of a back bench as the uncompromising champion of the old order &hellip; He was always most carefully dressed, and with his formal frock-coat and tall hat, and his slow dignified carriage he would walk to his seat and look round at the increasingly slipshod attire of his colleagues with sad disapproval. The advent of women members into the house he regarded as nothing short of an outrage. Banbury, in fact, became an institution. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>A. G. Gardiner thought him &#145;the sort of person that our public-school system turns out in troops&#146;  (Gardiner, 336).<br>
<br>Banbury was for many years a member, and in 1927&#150;8 chairman, of the council of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and was prominent in Our Dumb Friends League. He was a director of the Great Northern Railway from 1903 and its chairman from 1917, and he was a director of the London and Provincial Bank. He married in 1873 Elizabeth Rosa (<i>d</i>. 1930), daughter and coheir of Thomas Barbot Beale of Brettenham Park, Suffolk; they had one son, who was killed in action in 1914, and one daughter. Banbury died at Warneford Place, Highworth, Wiltshire, on 13 August 1936, and was succeeded as baron by his grandson, Charles William (1915&#150;1981).<br>
