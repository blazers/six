<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Philip</span>, first earl of Chesterfield  (1583/4&#150;1656), <span class="occ">royalist nobleman</span>, was the son of Sir John Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1609) and his first wife, Cordell Alington. Aged seventy-two when he died, Stanhope must have been born in 1583 or 1584; he may well have been the Philip Stanhope, son of John Stanhope, baptized at Holy Trinity-the-Less, London, on 6 January 1584. In the reign of Elizabeth the Stanhopes of Shelford had become one of the leading families in Nottinghamshire with substantial estates in the south of the shire. Philip Stanhope was knighted in 1605 and in the same year married Catherine, daughter of Francis, Lord Hastings. After her death in 1636 he married again; his second wife was Anne (<i>d</i>. 1667), widow of Sir Humphrey Ferrers and daughter of Sir John Pakington of Westwood, Worcestershire, and his wife, Dorothy Smith.<br>
<br>In November 1616 Stanhope paid Secretary Winwood &pound;10,000 for the barony of Shelford. This aroused the ire of another leading Nottinghamshire figure, Sir John Holles, who had recently paid a similar sum for a barony. Holles justified his complaint that his cousin's creation was &#145;a perpetuall dishonor to the King his Majesty and all the nobility&#146; with a list of Stanhope's brushes with the law. Holles reported that Stanhope had been twice indicted for buggery at the assizes, though he admitted the indictments had been passed over by the lord chief justice. Sir Philip and his accusers were embroiled in Star Chamber proceedings, where Holles claimed Stanhope had to pay costs for his unjust vexations. The accusation that Stanhope was often bound over to keep the peace can be sustained on one occasion, for in 1611 he forfeited a recognizance of &pound;500 after he failed to appear at the assizes and keep the peace. The more serious charge that he had been cleared by the king's pardon for a murder by his servants has less substance, for an investigation exonerated Stanhope of any involvement in the death. Stanhope's first appearance at the Nottinghamshire quarter sessions was in July 1612 and according to Holles he had been removed from the commission for his conduct. This could explain his absence from the sessions after April 1614, but he had returned by January 1616. Though it is not possible to substantiate all Holles's accusations, there is sufficient evidence to appreciate why John Chamberlain wished Winwood had &#145;met with a more worthy subject&#146; (<span class="italic">Letters of John Holles</span>, 1.142; <span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.33).<br>
<br>Stanhope remained on the Nottinghamshire bench, serving conscientiously until July 1627. Though no evidence appears to survive of his views about the legality of the forced loan, his removal from the commission of the peace at the same time as other opponents of the levy suggests he shared their views. He rarely attended the House of Lords, preferring to send a proxy. During the adjournment of parliament in August 1628 he was advanced to the earldom of Chesterfield and in December 1629 he was restored to the Nottinghamshire commission of the peace. Thereafter his attendances at quarter sessions were infrequent and none is recorded after January 1635. In February 1639, when he was commanded to attend the king at York, he pleaded for his failure to attend an &#145;extremity of weakness&#146; from which he doubted he would recover.<br>
<br>Chesterfield continued to be absent from the House of Lords. It is only in October 1642 that some indications of his political views emerge. The earl, who had built a mansion at Bretby in Derbyshire, joined the earl of Devonshire and the gentry of the shire in accusing Sir John Gell of disrupting the peace by his attempts to raise troops for parliament. In December, when Chesterfield and his son Ferdinando Stanhope vowed to attack Derby, Gell took his revenge and sent troops to attack Bretby House. When the parliamentarian troops stormed the house Chesterfield and his son fled and, after the earl's wife refused to give money to the soldiers for drink, the house was sacked. Chesterfield's troops plundered houses in the Vale of Belvoir and in January 1643 his house at Shelford became a satellite garrison for the royalist stronghold of Newark. In March 1643 Chesterfield was among the defenders of the close of Lichfield Cathedral when it was besieged by parliamentarian forces led by Lord Brook and Gell. According to Clarendon, Gell proceeded so vigorously and the defenders &#145;so faintly or unskilfully&#146; that the strong natural defences of the close were easily overcome  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.474&#150;5).<br>
<br>Chesterfield was taken prisoner and sent to London. In June 1643 the Lords granted his request that because of ill health he should be allowed to live in a private house. After pleas to parliament in 1646 he was allowed &pound;5 a week for his maintenance provided he did not entertain &#145;malign preachers&#146; or use the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>  (Whitelock, 2.239). It was not until April 1649 that Chesterfield asked to compound and his fine was fixed at &pound;8698 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The earl had previously claimed he was utterly disabled of all means to redeem himself for during his captivity his houses were ruined, his woods felled, and his lands laid waste, with personal estate worth more than &pound;36,000 carried away. As a result of the sequestration of his lands the burden of debts had been greatly increased. The committee for compounding reported that &pound;4000 was the most that the earl could procure on his credit and suggested that this sum should be accepted lest the whole be lost. The recommendation failed to pass the Commons and the lands of the earl were included in the first act of sale. As Chesterfield was tenant for life and was probably sixty-seven years of age any purchase of his lands was speculative. The Nottinghamshire properties were sold in 1652 but were later transferred by their purchasers in trust for his grandson and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26253/', "Philip Stanhope, Lord Stanhope (1633&#150;1714)")</script>. In 1654 Chesterfield had his allowance withdrawn by parliament as his house had become a refuge for dissidents. The earl paid heavily for his support of the king; three of his sons were killed fighting for the royalist cause and Shelford House was burnt to the ground. He died in London on 12 September 1656 and was buried in St Giles-in-the-Fields; his estates descended to his grandson Philip, who became the second earl.<br>
