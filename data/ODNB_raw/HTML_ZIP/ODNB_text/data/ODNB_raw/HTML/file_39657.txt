<span class="headword">Callender,  William Romaine</span>  (1825&#150;1876), <span class="occ">cotton spinner and politician</span>, was born on 2 June 1825 at 7 Nelson Street, Chorlton Row, Manchester, the elder son of William Romaine Callender (1794&#150;1872), merchant and calico printer, and his first wife, Hannah, the daughter of Samuel Pope from Exeter, probably a solicitor.<br>
<br>The Callenders were an ancient Scottish family, while the Romaines were of Huguenot origin, William Romaine (1714&#150;1795), Callender's great-uncle, having been a noted Calvinistic Anglican divine. Callender's father, after apprenticeship to a Birmingham draper, was by 1825 a partner in the expanding Manchester firm of Kershaw, Leese and Callender. He left this firm in 1836 and, after several more partnerships, set up Callender &amp; Sons, merchants and manufacturers, with his sons William Romaine Callender (from 1847) and Samuel Pope Callender as partners. This became one of Manchester's leading cotton spinners and merchants, acquiring in 1862 the mills of Thomas Bazley in Water Street, Manchester, and the Dean mills, Halliwell, Bolton.<br>
<br>The latter village community provided an ideal setting for Callender to put into practice his paternalist beliefs, as he attempted to revive its mutual improvement society and regularly addressed his workers on the values of literacy and self-help. Callender also invested, with Thomas Hughes among others, in the co-operative Cobden memorial mills in 1866, and in the late 1860s the family firm had purchased and modernized the Jackson Street Spinning Company of the philanthropic tory Robert Barnes. In 1849 Callender married Hannah, the only daughter of John Mayson JP of Manchester. Of their three sons and two daughters, the eldest son, Arthur William, Wykehamist, cotton spinner and insurance agent, was the father of the naval historian Sir Geoffrey Callender.<br>
<br>Callender's early death was to leave his business ventures in a parlous state, but his originality lay in his articulate rejection, in several influential pamphlets, of the creed of the cotton masters which his father, a stalwart Liberal nonconformist supporter of the Anti-Corn Law League, typified. For already by 1850 Callender, identifying himself with Manchester's strong tory&#150;Anglican &eacute;lite, was a critic of Cobdenite panaceas, doubting the ability of free trade to create new markets abroad for British goods, and urging the importance of home demand. He also discounted the ethical optimism of the league, emphasizing, in the manner of earlier evangelicals, the dependence of prosperity on morality in commerce.<br>
<br>Callender became a leading Manchester churchman and sought to rebuild local Conservatism on the pillars of church defence and working-class welfare. Unlike many employers, he defended, even lauded, trade unions and shorter hours. He was also a stalwart advocate of popular education, ready to insist that it should be compulsory and free, and of temperance, for, with his fellow Manchester tory Hugh Birley, he was one of the few tory supporters of the United Kingdom Alliance (led by his cousin Samuel Pope). Callender became the linchpin for the organizational rebuilding of the Conservative Party in south-east Lancashire in the 1850s, and sought a full place within it for the working classes.<br>
<br>Callender's anti-Liberalism took him in some strange directions (including financial succour to the former Chartist, Ernest Jones), but he became the most influential of the Lancashire employers, who in the late 1860s not only ensured the revitalization of the tory party locally, but also gave it a growing voice within the national party. Callender acted as Benjamin Disraeli's host on his famous Manchester visit of 1872 and influenced significantly the social legislation of the Conservative government, having become MP for Manchester in 1874. A leading and original exemplar of grassroots tory democracy, he would have been rewarded for his important contribution to the Disraelian Conservative Party with a baronetcy but for his unexpected death.<br>
<br>Balding, but heavily sideburned, Callender was a familiar, kindly, energetic, and popular figure in Manchester, occupying the usual array of positions for a provincial notable, JP for Salford, JP and deputy lieutenant for Lancashire, a director of the Manchester chamber of commerce, a captain in the volunteers, a member of the Union of the Institutes of Lancashire and Cheshire, a member of the Manchester school board from 1870 to 1873, and, succeeding J. A. Nicholls, honorary secretary of the Manchester Athenaeum. He was also prominent in the freemasons locally and nationally. His personal interests may be gleaned from his fellowship of the Society of Arts, travel in Palestine and Spain, and his collection of fine porcelain.<br>
<br>Callender, suffering from rheumatic neuralgia, and nervous prostration, died at 27 Eversfield Place, St Leonards, Sussex, on 22 January 1876, and was buried on 29 January at St John's, Heaton Mersey, his coffin accompanied by a mile-long cort&egrave;ge from his home, Mauldeth Hall, Burnage, Manchester (until 1872, the episcopal palace of Bishop James Fraser). He was survived by his wife. His untimely death belied his career and beliefs, for following the deaths of his father and brother in 1872 it was claimed that Callender had retained in the firm large sums due to the latter's heirs. This precipitated a complicated family legal dispute (resolved only in 1889), as a result of which the mills were closed in August 1877, the workforce was dispersed, and Barrow Bridge, the erstwhile model community, was soon known as Lancashire's &#145;deserted village&#146;.<br>
