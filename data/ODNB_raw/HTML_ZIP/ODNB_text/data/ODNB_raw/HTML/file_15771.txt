<span class="headword">Knowles,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1677), <span class="occ">antitrinitarian preacher and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Gloucester, the eldest of the three children of Henry Knowles, a prosperous tradesman in that city, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1661/2), who appointed her &#145;Loveing Son John Knowles&#146;  (will, 8 April 1661, Glos. RO) sole executor in her will.<br>
<br>Knowles's education is unknown but he was already preaching to Independent congregations as a teenager and he was clearly familiar with both the Greek text of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and the Latin commentators. Suspected of being an antitrinitarian for his association with the teacher John Biddle, he was requested about 1646 by the parliamentary committee at Gloucester to state his theological views. He sent them a letter confessing that he had denied for a while &#145;the Godhead of the holy Ghost&#146; but that afterwards he had been convinced that &#145;the holy ghost is God&#146;  (Eaton, 234). In 1646 Knowles found himself in controversy with the minister Giles Workman, who objected to Knowles's manuscript tract defending lay preaching, a document which Knowles then developed in his <span class="italic">A Modest Plea for Private Mens Preaching</span> (1648). By 1648 he had moved from Gloucester to London where he lodged in Aldersgate Street with Edward Atkinson, an antitrinitarian. He then joined the parliamentary army, belonging to &#145;the Life-Guard of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax&#146;  (Knowles, <span class="italic">Modest Plea</span>). He succeeded the Independent Samuel Eaton as preacher to the army garrison at Chester in 1650. His preaching at Chester was &#145;the earliest recorded case of avowed antitrinitarianism in an English pulpit&#146;  (Wilbur, 198). During his stay there he secretly distributed Biddle's <span class="italic">Confession of Faith</span>. Samuel Eaton was ill disposed towards his successor, no doubt because he had heard rumours of his &#145;unsoundnesse in the Doctrine of the Trinity&#146;  (Eaton, 5), and he sent a paper to Knowles's flock in defence of orthodoxy. Knowles replied with <span class="italic">A Friendly Debate on a Weighty Subject</span> (1650), in which he expressed views which were Arian rather than Socinian, arguing that Christ was truly the son of God but was not himself &#145;that most high God, whose Being and Actings are originally of himself&#146;  (Greaves &amp; Zaller, <span class="italic">BDBR</span>, 163). Eaton countered with <span class="italic">The Mystery of God Incarnate</span> (1650) and <span class="italic">A Vindication, or, Further Confirmation of some other Scriptures</span> (1651).<br>
<br>By the end of 1650 Eaton succeeded in securing Knowles's removal, as is evident from Thomas Porter's pamphlet <span class="italic">A Serious Exercitation</span>, published on 26 December 1650 and directed against the &#145;late Preacher at Chester&#146; John Knowles. Knowles came twice to the notice of the council of state for his erroneous opinions, witnesses being questioned about his views on 12 October 1650, when he was still in Chester, and on 19 November 1650, when he was back again in Gloucester. It is unclear whether any further action was taken but he then moved to the small country town of Pershore in Worcestershire, where he lived for some fifteen years as a professed minister. Here he devoted himself to studying, preaching, and collecting money in aid of the Polish exiles. From 5 June 1662 to 1 April 1665 he carried on an interesting correspondence with his Socinian friend Henry Hedworth, who vainly invited him to London to take charge of Biddle's congregation.<br>
<br>On 9 April 1665 Knowles was arrested under suspicion of disaffection towards the government. He was imprisoned first at Worcester and then, at the end of May, committed to the Gatehouse, Westminster. Papers found in his house at Pershore were seized and made the basis of charges of heresy and sedition. On 23 June he petitioned Lord Arlington for a speedy trial. In July he wrote to the king and to the duke of Albemarle protesting his innocence and entreating release, as the plague was then raging in London. These appeals were left unheeded for on 2 February 1666 he petitioned again. Not long after this fourth petition he was released.<br>
<br>Knowles remained in London and it seems that he accepted the invitation to become the leader of a group of Socinians. In 1668 he published his final works, this time on the moral theory of atonement, in opposition to the Calvinist Robert Ferguson, publishing two pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Freeness of Gods Grace in the Forgiveness of Sins by Jesus</span> (1668) and <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. Ferguson's Book</span> (1668), in both of which he argued that the sacrifice on the cross had for ever reconciled man to God. In early 1676 he is said to have preached at a Socinian meeting-house in Coleman Street. He was buried at St Peter Cornhill, London, on 23 November 1677. His will, dated 1 May 1676, named his nephew John Knowles and Henry Hedworth as executors. He owned a significant number of &#145;Books of value&#146;, some of which apparently went to a library in Gloucester, and he left &#145;a Third of all he had, for the Relief of Men persecuted for Religion, and other Charities&#146;  (Nye, 16).<br>
