<span class="headword">Pearce, Sir  William George</span>, second baronet  (1861&#150;1907), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and philanthropist</span>, was born at Chatham, Kent, on 23 July 1861, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21692/', "Sir William Pearce, first baronet (1833&#150;1888)")</script>, and his wife, Dinah Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Socoter of Gravesend, Kent. He was educated at Rugby School (1876&#150;8) and went in 1881 to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA and LLB in 1884. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1885.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in December 1888 Pearce succeeded him as chairman of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Glasgow, an undertaking the development of which had been the principal work of his father's life. Under Pearce's chairmanship, which lasted until his death, the company maintained its high reputation. He was also a chairman of the Scottish Oriental Steamship Company.<br>
<br>Pearce was returned to parliament in 1892 as Conservative member for Plymouth along with Sir Edward Clarke, but did not seek re-election in 1895. He was honorary colonel of the 2nd Devon volunteers Royal Garrison Artillery. He was a keen country sportsman, and his estate of Chilton Lodge, Hungerford, Berkshire, was noted for its shooting.<br>
<br>Pearce married Caroline Eva, daughter of Robert Coote, on 18 March 1905. They had no children. He died after a short illness on 2 November 1907 at his London home, 2 Deanery Street, Park Lane, and was buried at Chilton Foliat, near Hungerford. By his will he left the residue of his property, estimated at over &pound;150,000, subject to his wife's life interest, to Trinity College, Cambridge, though he had had no close association with the college since his graduation. Lady Pearce survived her husband by only a few weeks, and the college thus acquired probably the most valuable of the many accessions which have been made to its endowments since its foundation by Henry VIII in 1546.<br>
