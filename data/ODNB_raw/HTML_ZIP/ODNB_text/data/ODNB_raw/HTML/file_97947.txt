<span class="headword">Goddard,  Henry</span>  (1800&#150;1883), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born in the parish of Christ Church, Southwark, London, on 16 June 1800, the son of Joseph Goddard, fishmonger, and his wife, Catharine. He initially followed in his father's footsteps and became a fishmonger at Drury Lane. On 4 September 1825 he married, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies (1805/6&#150;1854), with whom he had at least two sons and five daughters. In the previous year he had enlisted, on 7 April 1824, in the Bow Street foot patrol. This body was part of the system of policing created in 1748 by Henry Fielding and his half-brother Sir John Fielding. He is listed in the foot patrol register as being 5 feet 9 inches tall&#151;above average height for the time&#151;and sturdily built. Goddard proved an able officer, and at the end of 1826 he successfully applied for the post of principal officer or &#145;runner&#146; at Great Marlborough Street public office, run by the magistrate Frederick Roe.<br>
<br>Great Marlborough Street was one of the seven public or police offices created by the <span class="roman">Middlesex Justices Act</span> of 1792 and modelled on the Bow Street public office. At Great Marlborough Street Goddard operated as a plain-clothes detective; principal officers never wore uniform and never patrolled the metropolitan streets in the manner of the less senior patrol constables. Goddard acquitted himself well and in early 1834 he followed the recently knighted Sir Frederick Roe to Bow Street, where he was engaged as a principal officer. This would undoubtedly have been regarded as a promotion, as Bow Street was seen as <i>primus inter pares</i>. As a principal officer Goddard took part in many daring and dangerous investigations. In March 1834 he was ordered to investigate the murder of the steward of Earl Arden at Epsom and he recorded that &#145;as I &hellip; would have to contend with desperate characters, I was not to forget to go armed with a brace of loaded pistols which Mr Stafford, the Chief Clerk would provide me&#146;  (Goddard, 78). Bow Street's early chronicler remarked that while &#145;their ensign of office &hellip; was a tiny baton with a gilt crown on the top malefactors knew perfectly well that their pockets held pistols as well as handcuffs&#146;  (Fitzgerald, 1.93).<br>
<br>Goddard proved himself to be an able and quick-witted principal officer, as testified by the magistrates of Tunbridge Wells, who in 1836 praised him in a letter to Bow Street for his investigation of an arson attack at Frant:<blockquote>Considering the very slight clue we had as to the offenders, the conduct, activity and intelligence of Mr Goddard cannot be too much commended. I can only express my own appreciation and that of the principal inhabitants of this place of his exertions in this matter. (Goddard, 130)</blockquote>He is often credited with being the first detective to carry out ballistic forensic analysis; in 1834 he solved a mysterious murder by proving that a projectile had been fired from a particular pistol by examining marks on the lead bullet and matching them to a bullet mould. In fact, this distinction belongs to one of Goddard's colleagues, Harry Adkins, who had done a similar analysis in 1812, though Goddard went one step further by locating and matching the ripped-up newspaper used for the wadding around the projectile, thereby proving his theory beyond doubt.<br>
<br>The Bow Street principal officers were disbanded in August 1839, some ten years after the creation of the Metropolitan Police. Goddard was awarded a pension of &pound;100 per year, and in April 1840 successfully applied for the post of chief constable of Northamptonshire at a salary of &pound;250 per year. He was sworn in as Northamptonshire's first chief constable at the Easter sessions of 1840, but does not appear to have taken his role&#151;in charge of 215 subordinates&#151;very seriously, and in 1848 was reprimanded by the county magistrates for failing to attend quarter sessions. On 3 January 1849 he handed in his resignation (possibly as a result of an injury he had sustained).<br>
<br>Goddard obviously disliked his period of inactivity, and in the following year he returned to London, where he joined the department of the gentleman usher of the black rod as a messenger, soon being promoted to the post of principal door keeper at the House of Lords, with a salary of &pound;300 per year. This does not appear to have been a very onerous position, as his diary for 1856 records that he was only in attendance for a total of 89 days throughout the year. Goddard took full advantage of this by operating as a private detective for many years, working both in the metropolis and in the provinces. He seems to have been primarily hired by the brothers John and Daniel Forrester of Mansion House, who ran a semi-official detective agency throughout the 1840s and 1850s.<br>
<br>Goddard married his second wife, Rose (1819/20&#150;1910), daughter of Charles Pryor, miller, in Stepney on 13 July 1858. He remained as principal doorkeeper for another twenty-three years, and retired in August 1883 on the grounds of failing health. He was granted a superannuation of &pound;165 per year and the Treasury also resumed its pension of &pound;100 per year for his former services as a Bow Street principal officer. He died at his home, 42 Maitland Park Road, Haverstock Hill, Middlesex, on 29 October 1883.<br>
<br>Goddard kept a diary from early on in his policing career, and in the mid-1870s he drew on these sources to produce a four-volume manuscript of his memoirs. Although these seem to have been compiled with a view to publication, they remained unpublished and forgotten until 1949, the bicentenary of the founding of the Bow Street public office, when a descendant donated the manuscript to Bow Street. Published in 1956, Goddard's <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Bow Street Runner</span> remains the only major published work by a former Bow Street principal officer and his writing is unusually candid and accurate; he clearly had an extremely good memory. His <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> have proved an invaluable source of information about the workings of both Bow Street and Great Marlborough Street public offices. As well as providing evidence for the professionalism of the &#145;old police&#146; in general and the Bow Street officers in particular, they have shown those forces' preoccupation with political as well as ordinary crime, and the extent of their reach outside London. Goddard's account of his own career after 1839 testifies to the continuing demand for private detective services in England after the creation of the &#145;new police&#146;.<br>
