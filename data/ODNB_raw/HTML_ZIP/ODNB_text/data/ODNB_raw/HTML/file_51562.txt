<span class="headword">Ian,  Leslie Charles Bowyer  Charteris</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Leslie Charles Bowyer Yin; <em>pseud. </em>Leslie Charteris]</span>  (1907&#150;1993), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born Leslie Charles Bowyer Yin in Singapore on 12 May 1907, the son of Dr Suat Chuan Yin (1876&#150;1958), a wealthy Chinese surgeon who claimed descent from the Shang emperors, and Lydia Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowyer (1876&#150;1953).<br>
<br>Yin's part-Chinese origins, which were clear from his good-looking features, grated with him and he reinvented himself as often as his famous fictional character Simon Templar, &#145;the Saint&#146;. He was brought up speaking Chinese and Malay as well as English. At ten he produced a four-page magazine, with his own illustrations of matchstick men&#151;the prototype for the Saint's distinctive haloed logo.<br>
<br>After the breakup of his parents' marriage in 1919, Yin and his mother went to England, where he attended Rossall School in Fleetwood, Lancashire, from 1920 to 1924 and King's College, Cambridge, which he left in 1926 after a year because, to his father's dismay, he wanted to write thrillers like Edgar Wallace and Sapper.<br>
<br>To support himself initially, Yin worked in a goldmine in Malaya and as a bartender, professional bridge player, and temporary policeman in Britain. He published his first stories as Leslie C. Bowyer. On 16 October 1926 he changed his name by deed poll to Leslie Charles Bowyer Charteris-Ian; he adopted &#145;Charteris&#146; after Colonel Francis Charteris, the eighteenth-century rake who was a founder member of the Hellfire Club. From then on he was known as Leslie Charteris.<br>
<br>Charteris's first book, <span class="italic">X Esquire</span>, published in 1927, told of a plot to destroy Britain with poisoned cigarettes. He experimented with a couple of heroes&#151;a Bulldog Drummond lookalike, Terry Mannering, and the cavalier Ramon Francisco de Castila y Esproneda Manrique&#151;before settling on the debonair Templar, who first appeared in <span class="italic">Meet the Tiger</span> in 1928. The character also appeared in stories for the magazine <span class="italic">The Thriller</span> and found popularity with <span class="italic">Enter the Saint</span> in 1930.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1931 Charteris married Pauline Schishkin (<i>d</i>. 1975), daughter of a Russian former tsarist diplomat. Unlikely to grow rich on <span class="italic">The Thriller</span>'s rate of 2 guineas per 1000 words, Charteris began visiting the United States in 1932 and wrote Hollywood film scripts, starting with <span class="italic">Midnight Club</span>, adapted from an E. Phillips Oppenheim novel.<br>
<br>Charteris continued his increasingly successful Saint books&#151;the mix of light humour, sophisticated settings, and story-line emphasizing the role of a crusader tackling the forces of evil having special appeal in the depression. He enjoyed the quasi-mythical element evident in his hero's <i>nom de guerre</i>, derived from the initials of Simon Templar&#151;itself a nod to the legend of the knights templar.<br>
<br>During the 1930s the Saint, who had many similarities with his author, went through a process of Americanization, apparent in the harder-edged <span class="italic">The Saint in New York</span> (1935). In 1938 the first Saint film was produced in Hollywood, starring the South African Louis Hayward. George Sanders later took up the role in 1939 in <span class="italic">The Saint Strikes Back</span>. By then Charteris was effectively living in North America, where his divorce from his first wife in 1937 was followed by marriage to Barbara Meyer (<i>d</i>. 1950) on 15 May 1939. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1943.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Saint in Miami</span> (1941) was an anti-Nazi thriller designed to encourage the United States to enter the Second World War. After Pearl Harbor, the Saint was transformed into a sober patriotic hero who worked alongside FBI chief Edgar Hoover's G-men.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1943 Charteris married his third wife, Elizabeth Bryant Borst (<i>b</i>. 1909), and in 1946 he became a naturalized American. He was divorced again in 1951, but on 26 April the following year he married actress Audrey Gwendoline Long (1922&#150;2014). From 1953 his stories appeared in his own <span class="italic">Saint Magazine</span>, as well as in ongoing novels, films, radio features, and cartoon strips.<br>
<br>The Saint metamorphosed again into a mere private detective, operating in colourful locations, but after more than a quarter of a century Charteris was tiring of his creation. In 1962 he sold the rights to make twenty-six television episodes of <span class="italic">The Saint</span> for &pound;500,000. The series starring Roger Moore gave Simon Templar a new lease of life, though, in reality, the Saint had been superseded in the public imagination by Ian Fleming's James Bond, a figure whom Charteris found vulgar and violent.<br>
<br>Having returned to Europe, Charteris became increasingly right-wing politically, backing Enoch Powell and capital punishment. Wealthier than ever, he devoted his time to pleasures such as eating, drinking, and racing. (He was a columnist for <span class="italic">Gourmet Magazine</span> and ran his own racehorses.) He maintained his intellectual interests, becoming a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and inventing a pictorial language called Paleneo. He also founded the Saint Club which raised money for east London charities. In the early 1970s he was resident in Dublin for tax purposes, though his main house was a large bungalow in Surrey and he also kept a hotel apartment in the south of France.<br>
<br>Further television adaptations of <span class="italic">The Saint</span> followed in the 1970s (featuring Ian Ogilvy) and 1980s (with Simon Dutton) and Charteris was happy for &#145;novelizations&#146; by others to appear under his name. He spent his final years in Britain as something of a recluse. He and his reputation were cared for by his fourth wife. In 1992 he won the Crime Writers' Association's diamond dagger award for lifetime achievement. In all he wrote fifty books, which were translated into twenty-one languages. Though his later novels were formulaic, his early work had a mischievous <i>jeu d'esprit</i> and understated sophistication not unlike that depicted by Roger Moore in his cinema James Bond&#151;significantly after he had played the Saint on television. Leslie Charteris died at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Windsor, on 15 April 1993 and his remains were cremated at Woking on 20 April.<br>
