<span class="headword">Dod,  John</span>  (1550&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in March 1550 at Shocklach, Cheshire, and baptized there on 15 March 1550, the youngest of seventeen children. He was educated at Chester School and Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1576. In 1578 he was appointed a fellow; in 1579 he proceeded MA and in 1580 he was ordained priest at Ely. While under suspicion of fraud at college he fell ill and converted to godly religion&#151;or puritanism as his opponents would have described it. Calvinist predestinarianism was the prevailing norm, but puritans claimed to be able to achieve a degree of assurance of elect status. As Dod's contemporary hagiographer Samuel Clarke explained &#145;the Lord sealed to him that his sins were washed away&#146;  (Clarke, <span class="italic">Generall Martyrologie</span>, 404). He befriended the Elizabethan reformer Thomas Cartwright, who was later to make him and Arthur Hildersham his literary executors; Dod preached Cartwright's funeral sermon. He joined a conference of Cambridge academics dedicated to scriptural study&#151;William Fulke, Laurence Chaderton, and William Whitaker&#151;and commenced his preaching career first as university lecturer then as lecturer to a godly congregation at Ely.<br>
<br>Dod was one of a handful of seventeenth-century puritan leaders with national standing. Cartwright described him as &#145;the fittest man in England for a pastoral office&#146;  (Clarke, <span class="italic">Lives of Thirty-Two English Divines</span>, 319), and Chaderton duly recommended him to Anthony Cope for his living of Hanwell, Oxfordshire. He resigned his fellowship in 1585, but always stayed in touch with his alma mater. At Hanwell, Dod practised a piety which treated parochial observances merely as the starting point for an entire evangelical puritan way of life. Preaching twice every sabbath was insufficient; he also read a lecture on Wednesdays, conducted catechism classes, and led a combination of ministers&#151;including Robert Cleaver, Robert Harris, William Scudder, and William Whately&#151;who preached at Banbury, ordered public fasts, and acted as a seminary. He enjoyed much godly kudos as a spiritual physician to assuage deathbed doubts about election&#151;performing this service for Thomas Peacock in 1611. Godly dynasticism is seen at work in Dod's choice of a bride, Ann Bownd, sister of the sabbatarian controversialist Nicholas Bownd, and stepdaughter of Richard Greenham. They had twelve children, two of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7732/', "Timothy Dod")</script> and John, became divines. In 1604 puritan aspirations to national reformation under a new, Calvinist monarch suffered a serious set-back. James I placated moderate puritans, but Dod and other hardliners rejected the proffered compromise&#151;subscription to Whitgift's three articles as the price of latitude on the observation of ceremonial conformity&#151;and as a result Bishop Bridges of Oxford suspended him from Hanwell about 1604 and ejected him by March 1607. The tight collegiality of his following is shown by the seamless transition that was made to the ministry of his pupil Harris.<br>
<br>On the run Dod tried to eke out a living at Fenny Compton, Warwickshire, before being invited to Northamptonshire by Sir Erasmus Dryden (the grandfather of the poet), who shielded him at Canons Ashby, which was little more than a private chapel. From here Dod and Cleaver evangelized the surrounding parishes between 1606 and 1611. Archbishop Abbot of Canterbury, who respected Dod, at first took no action, and this facilitated the production between 1605 and 1615 of Dod's and Cleaver's phenomenal <i>&#339;uvre</i>, although their most enduring work on the ten commandments (<span class="italic">A Plaine and Familiar Exposition of the Ten Commandements</span>, which had nineteen editions between 1603 and 1635, and which led to Dod's being nicknamed Decalogue Dod) had been produced at Hanwell. Three of the works were dedicated to Dryden and a further one to Lord John Harrington of Rutland; several were edited by John Winston of Ashby. Their work constitutes the most cogent explication not only of the religious observances of the community of the saints but of a distinctly godly code of ethics pervading every aspect of life: marriage, the household, the calling, dealings with the unregenerate mass. The convert was to reject his previous values and rely on the godly: &#145;Vicinitie and neighbourhood will faile, and alliance will fail, but grace and religion will never faile&#146;  (Dod and Cleaver, 119). Their sabbatarianism was particularly uncompromising. In an age when the book trade was crucial to disseminating ideas, this output explains the great scope of Dod's influence: both John Bunyan and Nehemiah Wallington possessed a copy of his work on the decalogue.<br>
<br>James I shattered this peaceful existence by requiring a reluctant Archbishop Abbot to interrogate Bishop Dove of Peterborough concerning Dod's unlicensed preaching in Northamptonshire and, under the wing of Lord Harrington, in Rutland. It was not until James's reiteration of the demand in 1614 that Dove took action and Dod was forced into hiding: the sympathy he aroused in Abbot and other moderates such as James Ussher was inadequate protection. (Dod, Ussher, and Ezechiel Culverwell had held a fast in 1612 on the day of Prince Henry's funeral, who was thought to be more sympathetic to the godly.) Dod was closely linked with London puritanism. On Ann's death he married a Miss Cleiton of Stratford-le-Bow at some date between 1607 and 1621. Before so doing he consulted the puritan minister Stephen Egerton of Blackfriars; and the ceremony was conducted by another godly friend, William Gouge. Dod also established contact with the Cambridge puritan leaders Richard Sibbes and John Preston, and in 1616 he approved Henry Jacob's formation of a semi-separatist church at Southwark. By the 1620s he was participating (with Preston and Thomas Hooker) in the quasi-exorcism of Joan Drake of Surrey. This backfired, initially at least, as the patient collapsed in gales of laughter comparing the heavily bearded Dod to Ananias, the fanatical puritan of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Alchemist</span>. This was strangely appropriate, as the playwright had heard of Dod and had previously told a joke about a gentlewoman who longed for sexual intercourse with the preacher &#145;for the procreation of an Angel or Saint&#146; but it proved &#145;an ordinary birth&#146;  (Collinson, &#145;Ben Jonson&#146;, 158). On James I's death in 1625 Abbot lifted Dod's suspension from preaching, but he was probably never required to subscribe, a singular favour. He now began to enjoy the patronage of the Drydens' godly neighbours, the Knightleys of Fawsley. Richard Knightley in 1625 installed him as the <i>de facto</i> vicar while another minister was titular incumbent. Dod remained at this essentially private chapel for the rest of his life, free to practise his own brand of semi-separatism as the patriarch of a godly enclave.<br>
<br>Through Preston and Knightley, Dod was now linked with a puritan network in the midlands centred on William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele, which led opposition to crown policies from the 1620s onwards. Dod demonstrated his opposition to prerogative taxation by preaching a sermon at London's Fleet prison to stiffen the resolve of Sir Francis Barrington, the first to refuse to pay the forced loan of 1626. Preston retired to Fawsley to die in 1628; Dod received a special mention in his will and preached at the funeral. In the same year Dod again served as spiritual physician&#151;this time for a dying minister called Throgmorton at Ashby. In 1630 Knightley set up a trust to support his prot&eacute;g&eacute;; trustees included Fiennes, Christopher Sherland, John Hampden, John Pym, John Crewe, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Edward Bagshaw, and Sir Arthur Hesilrige. In 1630&#150;31 Dod operated as an intermediary between Sir Erasmus Dryden and Sir John Isham during their attempted negotiation of a marriage settlement for Dryden's grandson John (not the poet) and Isham's daughter Elizabeth. The breakdown was chiefly the result of disagreements over finance, but Isham perhaps also baulked at Dryden's insistence that he employ a godly household chaplain approved by Knightley and &#145;worthely beloved Mr Dodd&#146;  (Northants. RO, Isham correspondence, 184). Dod's own response to the Caroline emphasis on ceremonial conformity was predictably resolute: in 1633 Bishop Lindsell of Peterborough reported that he was preaching heresy, and at Archbishop Laud's visitation of 1635 he was described as having refused to conform since 1607. He must also have supported Knightley's failure to set up an east-end railed altar at Fawsley in 1637. However, a variety of godly responses were tolerated: when John Cotton was harassed by the courts in 1632 Dod condoned the young man's emigration. Growing disillusionment with several bishops was balanced by concerns at the sectarianism of the New England churches, which was deemed to pose a threat to ministerial authority. In 1637 Dod led a gathering of midlands clergy including his son Timothy, Cleaver, and Winston, Julines Herring, Simeon Ashe, Ephraim Huitt, and John Ball which controverted several points of colonial ecclesiology.<br>
<br>In 1637 Knightley appointed first John Wilkins, who was Dod's grandson by marriage, and then Dod himself as titular incumbent of Fawsley. Knightley, to whom Dod had dedicated a grateful printed work in 1634, died in the same year, but his son and namesake continued to harbour the ageing evangelist, as he confirmed to another patron, Sir Robert Harley, in 1639. He also received the support of Lady Mary de Vere of London. Dod was harassed by royalist forces during the civil war, but continued to comfort his fellow professors; at the last he longed to be &#145;dissolved and to be with Christ&#146;  (Clarke, <span class="italic">Generall Martyrologie</span>, 416) and died at Fawsley, where he was buried on 19 August 1645.<br>
