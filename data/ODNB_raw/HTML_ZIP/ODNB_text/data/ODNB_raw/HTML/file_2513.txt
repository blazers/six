<span class="headword">Blackburne,  Francis</span>  (1705&#150;1787), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Richmond, Yorkshire, on 9 June 1705, the elder son of Francis Blackburne (<i>bap</i>. 1680?, <i>d</i>. 1708/9?), a businessman and alderman, and his wife, Alice (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1670), the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6024/', "Dr Thomas Comber")</script>, dean of Durham, and Alice Thornton. His father died at the age of twenty-nine, and his mother later married William Kirkby of Ashlack, Lancashire, to which the family moved. He was educated at schools in Kendal, Hawkshead, and Sedbergh, after which he spent a year studying with his maternal uncle, Thomas Comber, of East Newton, Yorkshire. He was admitted in May 1723 at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he became conduit or chaplain-fellow when ordained on 12 March 1728 by Bishop Green of Ely. He graduated BA in 1727, and MA in 1733. He was refused a fellowship of his college by its conservative fellows, who strongly disliked the firmly Lockean politico-theology which Blackburne had quickly imbibed when advised to read Locke on government on going up to Cambridge. He left Cambridge for East Newton, where he lived until 1739, having been taken ill with a nervous disorder which he overcame by taking up fox-hunting and other field sports. He was ordained priest by Bishop Gooch of Norwich at Ely Chapel, Holborn, on 18 March 1739 in order to qualify for the rectory of Richmond, which had been promised to him on the first vacancy. After taking up the rectory he resided in Richmond until his death. On 30 August 1744 he married Hannah Elsworth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hotham (1713&#150;1799), the widow of Joshua Elsworth, with whom she had had three children, one of whom, Hannah, later married Theophilus Lindsey, the founder of Unitarianism.<br>
<br>It was at Richmond that Blackburne began seriously to read. In 1742 he became chaplain to Henry D'Arcy of Sedbury, near Richmond. He was collated to the archdeaconry of Cleveland in 1750, and in August that year he was given the prebend of Bilton by Archbishop Hutton, to whom he was titular chaplain. His liberal principles prevented him from taking any further preferment since he had made up his mind never again to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. In an apology published in 1750 he defended John Jones's <span class="italic">Free and Candid Disquisitions Relating to the Church of England</span> (1749), denying that he had any part in their composition, though he had seen the work in manuscript. In 1752 he anonymously published a controversial attack on Bishop Joseph Butler's 1751 charge, <span class="italic">A Serious Inquiry into the Use and Importance of External Religion</span>, in which he accused Butler of coming close to Roman Catholicism on the matter. This was first printed with Blackburne's name in 1767 in <span class="italic">Pillars of Priestcraft and Orthodoxy Shaken</span>, a collection edited by the dissenting minister and controversialist Richard Baron.<br>
<br>Blackburne supported the mortalism of his Cambridge friend and contemporary Edmund Law in a tract called <span class="italic">No Proof in the Scriptures of an Intermediate State</span> (1755). This stated the heterodox belief that the soul, which was not naturally immortal, but was made so by Christ, passed into a state of sleep between death and the resurrection into eternal life. This restatement of a doctrine which had been held by several of the civil war sects provoked a minor controversy in the 1750s and 1760s, and it related to Blackburne's increasing interest in the incendiary politico-theology of the mid-seventeenth century. A further contribution to the debate, <span class="italic">A Historical View of the Controversy Concerning an Intermediate State</span>, appeared in 1765, of which a second, much enlarged edition appeared in 1772. This brought him into collision with Bishop William Warburton on the matter, and Blackburne considered his own &#145;masterpiece&#146; to be his response to Warburton's ire, <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr. Warburton's Account of the Sentiments of the Jews Concerning the Soul</span>. Blackburne played a leading role in the controversy over subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> which convulsed Cambridge in the 1760s and 1770s, an engagement which also saw him on Law's side. In 1758 he had argued, in <span class="italic">Remarks on the Rev. Dr. Powell's Sermon in Defence of Subscription</span>, against what he considered to be the casuistry which would permit subscription to articles to be made with a considerable latitude of meaning. This led him to write his best-known work, the <span class="italic">Confessional, or, A full and free inquiry into the right, utility, and success of establishing confessions of faith and doctrine in protestant churches</span>, which appeared in May 1766, but which had been in preparation for some years before. Nathaniel Lardner, the dissenting divine and a fellow church historian, had long wanted Blackburne to go into print on the matter, and it was the bibliophile and philanthropist Thomas Hollis, a champion of the commonwealth tradition in English political thought, who finally persuaded him to publish the manuscript. Andrew Millar published the work anonymously; a second edition appeared in 1767, and a third, enlarged edition in 1770. The work took the form of a decidedly polemical account of the history of the Church of England, in which Blackburne attacked those who defended subscription to Calvinist articles according to their own lax interpretations; he denounced orthodoxy as a man of straw. He was particularly critical of Laud's Arminian interpretation of the articles, and he lamented that conditions of service in the church required of honest men that they confront the dilemma of &#145;<i>subscribe</i> or starve&#146;. A lively controversy arose; it has been calculated that orthodox responses to the <span class="italic">Confessional</span>, largely supported by Archbishop Thomas Secker who despised Blackburne for his attack on Butler, amounted to enough to fill ten volumes. In 1772 a petition was drawn up at the Feathers tavern in London, which belonged to Peterhouse, in support of Blackburne's proposal that a private statement of faith, of the sort sworn by his own son at Cambridge, should be substituted for subscription to the articles. The petition was signed by some 200 people: it was rejected by the House of Commons by 217 votes to 71.<br>
<br>Theophilus Lindsey, the husband of Blackburne's stepdaughter, and Dr John Disney, who married his elder daughter, Jane, were deeply involved in the debate, and both of them shortly afterwards left the Church of England in favour of the new denomination which they founded: Unitarianism. Blackburne was widely supposed to share their views, and his sincerity on the doctrine of the Trinity was questioned accordingly. On Disney's secession, Blackburne drew up a paper called &#145;An answer to the question, why are not you a Socinian?&#146;, in the course of which he denounced &#145;<i>rational Christianity</i>, the foster father of modern infidelity&#146;. He also declared himself to be a Calvinist of &#145;the largest and most liberal sort&#146;. This was later published as an appendix to the introductory &#145;Life&#146; with which his son, also named Francis, prefaced an edition of his works in 1804&#150;5. Blackburne continued to emphasize his opposition to tests, but it was pointed out that he was no clerical careerist since his preferments produced only &pound;150 a year, and he had declined an offer to succeed Samuel Chandler at the fashionable dissenting chapel in London, the Old Jewry, at a salary of &pound;400.<br>
<br>Blackburne abandoned plans to publish a life of Luther, on which he had undertaken considerable amounts of research, in favour of an act of personal piety, writing instead a two-volume life of his friend and patron Hollis, which appeared, together with many rich engravings, in 1780. This anonymously published work takes the form of a memorial to the radical tradition whose values Hollis had venerated and encouraged, both in England and in America, and whose extremely liberal religious views were admired but not shared by Blackburne. A figure central to this tradition, John Milton, had been defended by Blackburne in his <span class="italic">Remarks on Johnson's Life of Milton</span> (1780). Blackburne began to lose his sight in 1784, and he resorted to the use of an amanuensis. In 1787 he performed his thirty-eighth visitation of Cleveland, and he died peacefully in his chair at home in Richmond on 7 August 1787. He left his wife, who died on 23 August 1799, and four children: Jane, married to Dr Disney; Francis, vicar of Brignal; Sarah, married to the Revd John Hall, vicar of Chew Magna; and William, a physician in London. A son Thomas had died aged thirty-three in Durham in 1782.<br>
<br>Blackburne's <span class="italic">Works, Theological and Miscellaneous</span>, together with a detailed memoir, were edited by his son and published by Benjamin Flower, a radical Cambridge publisher, in seven volumes. Besides the works mentioned above, they contain his charges as archdeacon, which reveal his marked antipathy towards Roman Catholicism, to which he was not at all prepared to extend full toleration and of which denomination he was a very firm critic. A large number of miscellaneous pamphlets comprise the remaining volumes.<br>
