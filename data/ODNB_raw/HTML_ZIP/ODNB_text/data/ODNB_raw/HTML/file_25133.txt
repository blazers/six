<span class="headword">Bovill,  Sewal  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1257), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, is of unknown origins. He attended Oxford University where he was a contemporary of Edmund of Abingdon; he was described by Matthew Paris as the &#145;disciple in the schools, pupil and fellow scholar&#146; of the future archbishop, whose canonization he was later to support  (Paris, 5.691). Edmund, who was greatly attached to Sewal, is said to have foretold his friend's promotion and troubles. By 1244, when he was chancellor of the university, Bovill was a doctor of theology. In 1236 he was made canon and prebendary of York, a position he still held in 1241, and canon and prebendary of Southwell; he also obtained the prebend of Fenton about 1247. Between 1245 and 1248 he was archdeacon of York, after which he became dean of that cathedral, retaining this post until his advancement to the episcopate in 1256. On the death of Archbishop Walter de Gray in 1255 the canons elected him to the vacant see, but the king refused his consent on the ground that Bovill was of illegitimate birth. The chapter appealed to Rome on 1 October, and eventually the pope granted a dispensation removing the defect of birth, and confirmed the election. The king gave his assent on 4 May 1256, and Bovill was consecrated at York on 23 July by Walter de Cantilupe, bishop of Worcester. Shortly after Sewal's consecration, Adam Marsh sent him a long letter of advice urging him to take Bishop Grosseteste as his example. The pope claimed the right to appoint to the now vacant deanery, and in 1257 an Italian, Jordan, was installed by his authority. Bovill resisted the intrusion, and as a consequence was suspended from his office and excommunicated. The dispute was resolved (and the excommunication therefore lifted) by the provision of a pension for Jordan, and Godfrey of Ludham was appointed as dean. In March of that year Bovill was granted a licence to visit the shrine of St Edmund at Pontigny, and on 20 July 1257 he was one of the commissioners appointed to decide the dispute between Alexander of Scotland and his nobles.<br>
<br>Bovill's rule as archbishop was troubled by his quarrel with the pope, whom on his deathbed he summoned to judgement. But his sufferings and resistance to papal intrusion won him great popularity. Matthew Paris describes him as, &#145;a humble and holy man well skilled in law and other sciences&#146;  (Paris, 5.516). However, despite assertions of John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563), his only surviving work is a verse repeated by one of his clerks to Matthew Paris. Sewal de Bovill died on 10 May 1257 and was buried in the south transept of York Minster, where his tomb is marked by a marble slab bearing a cross.<br>
