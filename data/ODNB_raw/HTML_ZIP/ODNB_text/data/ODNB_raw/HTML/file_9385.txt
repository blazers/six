<span class="headword">Field,  George</span>  (1777&#150;1854), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in March 1777 at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, where he was baptized on 16 March 1777 and where his family had resided since at least the sixteenth century. Field was educated at St Peter's School in Berkhamsted. In the mid-1790s, following the death of his father, he moved to London, where he was soon attracted to the study of natural dyestuffs, especially the widely used red colourant obtained from the root of the madder plant. At that time the main European suppliers of the dye were the French and the Dutch, but access to these sources had been restricted by war. As a result, Field decided to attempt the cultivation of madder in England. It has been claimed (without substantiation) that he turned for advice to Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, who had made an earlier (abortive) attempt to grow the plant in Essex. Field succeeded, both in growing the plant and in extracting from the crushed root a preparation that contained the colourant. A growing interest in art and artists' pigments led him to become one of the three directors of the British School, an exhibition gallery opened in Berners Street, London, in October 1802. In this venture Field was associated with the marine painter John Thomas Serres, whose parlous financial affairs brought about closure of the school in 1804.<br>
<br>After the school's closure Field devoted his energies to the improvement of artists' colours, undertaking experiments with madder lakes (coloured compounds made from a dye and a metal salt). He devised a drying stove for which he was awarded a silver medal by the Society of Arts in 1806 and, in 1808, opened a works for production of lakes at Conham, near Bristol. This well-planned works, laid out in the form of a circle, was to make Field's fortune. His interest in science and art led to the invention of the &#145;lenticular prism&#146; or chromascope and the development of an alkaline yellow (Lemon yellow) based on barium chromate. He also invented a chromometer, or metrochrome, that permitted him to work out values of the three primaries for any colour. However, the values he obtained were questioned even during his lifetime. Field also developed an improved process for madder production, which involved a drying stove and press for removal of colourant from the root, as well as a novel apparatus&#151;a &#145;physeter&#146;, or percolator&#151;working at atmospheric pressure. These were exhibited before the Society of Arts, and in 1816 gained Field the society's gold Isis medal &#145;for his apparatus for preparing coloured lakes&#146;. (The percolator was later patented by other inventors and used for the clearing of sugar.) Field constructed a new and larger factory at Hounslow Heath, west of London, about 1813, and subsequently became an avid collector of paintings and sketches. He went on to enlarge his range of high quality artists' colours, notably with various madder-based lakes, and the mineral pigment ultramarine.<br>
<br>In 1817 Field published his first contributions to the study of physical sciences, and went on to write about theology, art, science, and technology. He is best-known as the author of the technically detailed <span class="italic">Chromatography, or, A Treatise on Colours and Pigments, and of their Powers in Painting</span> (1835), which was intended to point out to students of art the &#145;true character and powers of colours and pigments&#146;  (xi). There were three later editions (1841, 1869, 1885), and a German edition. A version was published as <span class="italic">Rudiments of the Painters' Art, or, A Grammar of Colouring Applicable to Operative Painting, Decorative Architecture and the Arts</span> (1850), which again went to three further editions (1858, 1870, 1875); his concern with the harmony of colours and their impact on painting was carried over to his aesthetic writings. Field died at his home, The Cottage, Syon Hill Park, Isleworth, Middlesex, on 28 September 1854.<br>
