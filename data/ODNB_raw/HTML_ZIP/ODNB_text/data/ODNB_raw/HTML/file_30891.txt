<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Calder,  Peter Ritchie</span>, Baron Ritchie-Calder  (1906&#150;1982), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born on 1 July 1906 at 6 Newmonthill, Forfar, Forfarshire, the youngest in the family of one daughter and three sons of David Lindsay Calder, linen worker (later works manager), and his wife, Georgina, daughter of John Ritchie, master mason. He was educated at Forfar Academy, which he left at the age of sixteen.<br>
<br>Calder began his career in 1922 as a police court reporter with the <span class="italic">Dundee Courier</span>. He then worked with the D. C. Thomson Press before joining the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (1926&#150;30), the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> (1930), and the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> (1930&#150;41). During these years his range of interests broadened considerably. Politically he was, and always remained, a dedicated socialist and member of the Labour Party, and the social problems and political strife of the inter-war years provided many subjects for perceptive record and comment. In 1927 he married Mabel Jane Forbes McKail (1906&#150;2001), daughter of David McKail, a physician, of Glasgow. They had three sons and two daughters; the middle son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99794/', "Angus Calder (1942&#150;2008)")</script>, was later a distinguished historian and literary critic.<br>
<br>A chance assignment to cover a science story opened up a completely new field for Calder. He realized that application of new scientific knowledge could powerfully augment the conventional approach to social problems. A timely stimulus to this new interest was provided by acquaintanceship&#151;which grew into close and lasting friendship&#151;with John Boyd Orr, who was making a name for himself in the field of animal and human nutrition. Seeing malnutrition as a global problem, Calder devoted much effort to publicizing Boyd Orr's ideas and activities. This he did not only through his own newspaper connections but also through documentary films, then establishing themselves as a powerful means of influencing public opinion. Boyd Orr's book <span class="italic">Food, Health and Income</span> was published in 1936 and Calder played an important part in producing a film version entitled <span class="italic">Enough to Eat?</span>
<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War inevitably diverted much of Calder's activity into other fields. During the blitz his vivid reports helped to make the world aware that temporarily the front line of the war was in London. In 1941 he was appointed to the political warfare executive of the Foreign Office, a service for which he was appointed CBE in 1945. One of his first tasks during this time was to assist, with Boyd Orr, in the production of a film, <span class="italic">World of Plenty</span>, to show the world how Britain was using food sent from the USA.<br>
<br>The immediate post-war years were very favourable to the resumption of Calder's career, initially as science editor of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> (1945&#150;56) and as a member of the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. The new Labour government was committed to a radical programme of social reform in which a key element was to be the harnessing of science to national needs. On a wider front, the newly created agencies of the United Nations sought to achieve similar ends internationally. In recording and promoting all these activities he found himself involved to an extent that severely taxed even his seemingly boundless enthusiasm and energy. He clearly understood that progress could be made only if public opinion was informed and favourable.<br>
<br>Despite the euphoric view of science created by great wartime achievements such as atomic energy, radar, and penicillin, the post-war media paid little more than lip-service to science. To help to alleviate this, Calder took a leading role in establishing the Association of British Science Writers, of which he was the first chairman (1949&#150;55), and in which he always took great pride. In 1960 he was awarded the Kalinga award for science writing.<br>
<br>After the war Calder undertook many assignments for United Nations agencies, often on the initiative of Boyd Orr, who became the first director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization and invited him to attend the famine conference in Washington (1946) as a special adviser. He went on arduous missions to study the utilization of human resources in north Africa, Congo (1960), and south-east Asia (1962).<br>
<br>Calder's exceptional knowledge of international affairs led the University of Edinburgh to appoint him to the Montague Burton professorship of international relations (1961&#150;7). This was a remarkable tribute to a man who had had no formal higher education. His fluent and easy manner, and varied reminiscences, appealed to the students. The appointment opened many academic doors and he was awarded honorary doctorates by the Open University (1975) and York University in Ontario, Canada (1976). He was senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, Santa Barbara, California, USA (1972&#150;5).<br>
<br>Calder was passionately devoted to the cause of peace, particularly in the post-war years when there was so much uncertainty about where atomic weapons would ultimately take us. He was president of the British Peace Council and a leader of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He wrote a number of books on scientific, medical, and environmental topics for a general audience, including histories of the World Health Organization (1958) and the Weizmann Institute (1959). In 1966 he was created a life peer as Baron Ritchie-Calder of Balmashannar and three years later was made chairman of the Metrication Board, retiring in 1972. He died on 31 January 1982 at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh.<br>
