<span class="headword">Robinson,  Emma</span>  (1814&#150;1890), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born in London, the daughter of Joseph Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1856), a bookseller at 309 Oxford Street. Nothing is known of her mother nor much of her own life. In 1844 at the age of thirty she published, anonymously, <span class="italic">Whitefriars, or, The Days of Charles the Second: an Historical Romance</span>, the first of twelve historical novels. She was apparently self-educated. According to contemporaries, all her fiction was published anonymously because her father forbade her using her own name, and one source suggested that Joseph Robinson led people to believe he was the author of her works  (Tinsley, 1.92).<br>
<br>In the same year that she published her first novel, Robinson sent a historical three-act play, <span class="italic">Richelieu</span> (under the pseudonym a Young Oxonian), to J. R. Planch&eacute; at Covent Garden. Although he recognized merit in the work, he felt that it was not strong enough to produce, and it is also possible that he foresaw the reaction of the lord chamberlain's office which quickly banned the play for &#145;bringing church and state into contempt&#146;  (Blain, Clements &amp; Grundy, <span class="italic">Feminist comp.</span>, 914). Robinson subsequently published it as <span class="italic">Richelieu in Love</span>, and it was licensed and performed in 1852, albeit without success.<br>
<br>After publishing seven historical novels from 1844 to 1849 (followed by five more from 1854 to 1865), Robinson shifted her interests to social critiques of contemporary society. Her first effort was <span class="italic">The Gold-Worshippers, or, The Days we Live in: a Future Historical Novel</span> (1851), followed by four others. One of these, <span class="italic">Which Wins, Love or Money?</span> (1862), provided the story, character, incidents, and dialogue for H. T. Craven's three-act <span class="italic">Philomel</span>, produced at the Globe Theatre in London in 1870. Her last publication was a critique of the marriage market, <span class="italic">The Matrimonial Vanity Fair</span> (1867). None of her works has been republished.<br>
<br>Robinson's historical fiction is characterized by fluency and na&iuml;vety, and most of her social fiction is conventional and made up of stereotypical characters. But both types of fiction display a surprising lack of moral righteousness about sexual matters which leads to an uncharacteristic investigation of physical desire and a lack of sentimentality about marriage. In the case of <span class="italic">Mauleverer's Divorce, or, The Story of a Woman's Wrongs</span> (1858), written in the wake of the debates over the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Bill</span> of 1857, her lack of moralism and her efforts to deal complexly with a complex issue led to an interesting novel that experiments with point of view, an open ending, and indeterminacy of character.<br>
<br>Robinson was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;75 in 1862 on the basis of her various works. Earlier she had applied to the Royal Literary Fund for relief. Some time after her last publication in 1867, she became mentally ill. She died in the London County Lunatic Asylum at Norwood on 18 December 1890, with the causes of death listed as bronchitis, heart disease, and cirrhosis of the liver.<br>
