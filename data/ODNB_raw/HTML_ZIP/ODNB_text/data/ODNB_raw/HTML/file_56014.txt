<span class="headword">Hal&eacute;vy,  &Eacute;lie</span>  (1870&#150;1937), <span class="occ">historian and philosopher</span>, was born on 6 September 1870 at &Eacute;tretat, Normandy, in France. He was the elder son of Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy (1834&#150;1908), writer and librettist, and his wife, Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Br&eacute;guet (1847&#150;1930), heir to the industrialist and scientist Louis Br&eacute;guet. His younger brother was the critic and contemporary historian Daniel Hal&eacute;vy. Hal&eacute;vy's father was Jewish and his mother protestant; the children were raised as protestants. Brought up in Paris, Hal&eacute;vy was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet and at the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. He passed the <i>agr&eacute;gation</i> in 1892, but instead of proceeding to an academic career within the state system he accepted &Eacute;mile Boutmy's offer of a post at the &Eacute;cole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. He held a chair there from 1898 until his death, and his teaching was interrupted only by a period of wartime medical service.<br>
<br>Boutmy, himself a distinguished student of British history and institutions, initially invited him to teach the history of British political ideas, and from 1902 Hal&eacute;vy offered this alternately with a course on the history of socialism. These were to remain his chief interests in a remarkably focused career. His private income spared him the quest for academic preferment and enabled him to devote himself to his scholarly writing. He was no recluse: like his brother, he was active in rallying intellectuals to the cause of Dreyfus in 1898, and after the First World War he was offered, but declined, a post in the secretariat of the League of Nations. But he was unwavering in his commitment to his scholarly vocation. On 17 October 1901 Hal&eacute;vy married Florence Noufflard (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1957), daughter of the musicologist Georges Noufflard and his Italian wife, Emilia Landrini. There were no children of the marriage. Florence accompanied him on many of his research trips to Britain, and shared in his scholarly activities to the full.<br>
<br>Hal&eacute;vy was by training a philosopher rather than a historian: his first book was <span class="italic">La th&eacute;orie platonicienne des sciences</span> (1896), and together with his former classmates Xavier L&eacute;on and L&eacute;on Brunschvicg he founded and co-edited the <span class="italic">Revue de M&eacute;taphysique et de Morale</span>. He also assisted in the foundation of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Philosophie. Hal&eacute;vy's involvement in both institutions was lifelong. His closest friends were <i>normalien</i> philosophers such as &Eacute;mile Chartier (Alain) and C&eacute;lestin Bougl&eacute;, as well as Brunschvicg and L&eacute;on. Yet Hal&eacute;vy made his name not as a philosopher but as a historian of nineteenth-century Britain. He seems to have been launched on this intellectual itinerary by a distaste for philosophies that lacked practical bite, and this led him to the study of Bentham, a philosopher not of the front rank, but who fascinated Hal&eacute;vy as &#145;le type du philosophe <i>r&eacute;formateur</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondance</span>, 179). This interest yielded a remarkable and enduring work of intellectual history, <span class="italic">La formation du radicalisme philosophique</span> (3 vols., 1901&#150;4), part of which he submitted as his doctoral thesis in 1901; it then led him into mainstream political and general history of Britain in his multi-volume <span class="italic">Histoire du peuple anglais au XIXe si&egrave;cle</span>. This work, Hal&eacute;vy's <i>magnum opus</i>, remained incomplete: volumes 1&#150;3 (1912&#150;23) dealt with the period 1815&#150;41, and in 1926 and 1932 he published a two-volume epilogue treating the period 1895&#150;1914. He never completed his treatment of the high Victorian period. Nevertheless he made a major and lasting impact upon the study of modern British history. The popularity of the English translations, which first appeared between 1924 and 1934, was confirmed by their publication in paperback by Penguin Books.<br>
<br>Hal&eacute;vy's study of the philosophic radicals was a pioneering work in the history of ideas, and in analytical depth it greatly surpassed Sir Leslie Stephen's contemporaneous work on <span class="italic">The English Utilitarians</span>. It has never been bettered as a study of Benthamism, although more recent work has suggested a more modest estimate of the Benthamite influence on the nineteenth-century mind. Hal&eacute;vy's interpretation&#151;which was characteristic of his historical method&#151;was structured about a pivotal distinction between two ultimately contradictory strands in Benthamism: the principle of the artificial identification of interests, which underpinned the philosophic radicals' political and legal theory; and the principle of the natural identity of interests, which underlay their economic doctrine. Hal&eacute;vy hinted at the collectivist potential in utilitarianism, and the implications of his work were thus subtly different from those of Dicey's lectures on the shift from individualism to collectivism in public policy.<br>
<br>In his volume <span class="italic">L'Angleterre en 1815</span>&#151;Hal&eacute;vy's acknowledged masterpiece, which was rejected by the first publisher he approached&#151;he expounded the &#145;Hal&eacute;vy thesis&#146; that nineteenth-century Britain was saved from revolution by the influence of nonconformist religion, and especially Methodism. His work displayed great historical sensitivity and command of the sources; it also revealed, typically, a deep philosophical purpose. Like Max Weber just a few years before, Hal&eacute;vy was keen to deploy historical investigation as a tool with which to refute historical materialism. The Marxist thesis would suggest that Britain was ripe for revolution in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. Britain's avoidance of that fate could hardly be explained by the strength of its political institutions, for the student of Bentham depicted the unreformed British state as a ramshackle chaos. It was ideas&#151;not abstract ideas, but ideas as they acted on the public mind and were altered thereby&#151;that provided the only credible explanation for Britain's political stability in the early phase of the industrial revolution.<br>
<br>The volumes Hal&eacute;vy's fellow countrymen most admired dealt with the period 1895&#150;1914. Here he expounded a remarkably controlled thesis that both predated and surpassed George Dangerfield's more famous interpretation in <span class="italic">The Strange Death of Liberal England</span> (1936). But these volumes on the pre-war crisis were somewhat detached from the overall conception of Hal&eacute;vy's <span class="italic">History</span>; they were distinctly more pessimistic, as he traced the erosion of the vigorous liberal consensus of the high Victorian decades. They had more affinity with his inter-war reflections on problems in the interpretation of contemporary history. War and its impact now preoccupied him, and he served on the commission for the publication of French diplomatic documents on the origins of the First World War. He expounded an original thesis on this question in <span class="italic">The World Crisis of 1914&#150;1918: an Interpretation</span> (1930); and in a paper, &#145;L'&egrave;re des tyrannies&#146;, which he delivered to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Philosophie in 1936, he considered the relations between socialism and fascism, and traced their convergence to the impact of the war. These works, acute and powerful as they are, show his sympathetic interest in socialism hardening into the hostility of the liberal critic of generic totalitarianism.<br>
<br>Hal&eacute;vy moved easily between French and British intellectual circles, perhaps more easily than any other twentieth-century French academic of the first rank. He spent a good portion of each year in Britain, usually working in the British Museum, and he reviewed for British periodicals. He also had an impressively wide range of British friends, who included H. A. L. Fisher, Graham Wallas, the Webbs, and Bertrand Russell; this circle of friends, mostly to the left of Hal&eacute;vy in politics, reflected his lifelong interest in British political ideas and in the history of socialism. He was awarded the honorary degree of DLitt by the University of Oxford in 1926, and delivered the Rhodes memorial lectures in the same university in 1929. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 21 August 1937, at his home, La Maison Blanche, Sucy-en-Brie (Seine-et-Marne), to the south-east of Paris.<br>
<br>In his lifetime, and for decades afterwards, Hal&eacute;vy and his works were better known in Britain than in France. Later, however, French interest in Hal&eacute;vy revived with the rediscovery of that lost tradition of French liberalism stretching from Constant and Guizot through Tocqueville to Hal&eacute;vy's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Raymond Aron. Hal&eacute;vy's work came to be celebrated by the allies of Fran&ccedil;ois Furet. The philosopher who turned via the history of ideas to British political history at last became, through his historical work on Britain, an important presence in the intellectual history of France.<br>
