<span class="headword">Light,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1740, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">colonist in Penang, Malaya</span>, was baptized on 15 December 1740 in the parish church of Dallinghoo, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk, the natural younger son of William Negus, a prominent landowner of Melton, near Woodbridge, and Mary Light. He was educated at Seckford's Grammar School at Woodbridge and entered the Royal Navy in 1759 as a midshipman aboard the <i>Captain</i>. He transferred shortly afterwards to the <i>Dragon</i> as an able seaman, but in 1761 he joined the <i>Arrogant</i> as a midshipman. In 1763 he was paid off and two years later he embarked for India.<br>
<br>At Madras he obtained command of a country ship belonging to a syndicate of European merchants with interests in Sumatra and the northern regions of the Malay peninsula. He established trading connections with the sultan of Kedah, by whom he was offered in 1771 the port and the coast as far as the island of Penang in return for protection against the bugis of Selangor. He urged on his superiors in Madras the advantages of accepting this offer and on the East India Company the desirability of acquiring Penang as a commercial centre. Missions led by Edward Monckton and Charles Des Voeux were dispatched by the company in 1772 to north Sumatra and Kedah, but without results, because the East India Company refused to promise aid against Selangor.<br>
<br>Light continued to engage in private trade during the 1770s and early 1780s, notably in Salang, off the north-west coast of Siam. Growing Dutch power in the region led to new interest in establishing a British base in the Strait of Malacca, and in 1786 he obtained a renewal of the offer of Penang from the sultan of Kedah, on condition of a defensive alliance with the East India Company. This offer was accepted and Light was appointed superintendent of the island, which was formally acquired as a British possession on 11 August 1786 and called Prince of Wales Island.<br>
<br>From then on Light administered Penang with great skill and energy, and this led to a considerable growth in population and trade. He also successfully defended the island against an attempt by the sultan of Kedah in 1791 to reclaim it because of the East India Company's failure to observe the defensive clause in the treaty of cession.<br>
<br>Light lived with a Portuguese Eurasian woman, Martinha Rozells, and they had at least three children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16646/', "William Light (1786&#150;1839)")</script>, the founder of Adelaide. Light died on 21 October 1794 in Penang.<br>
