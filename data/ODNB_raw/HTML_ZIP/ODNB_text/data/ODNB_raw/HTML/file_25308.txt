<span class="headword">Sheldrake,  Timothy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1691?, <em>d.</em> before 1759), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was probably the son of Timothy Sheldrake (<i>d</i>. 1717), saddler, and his wife, Anne, baptized at St Gregory, Norwich, on 25 September 1691. In a biographical sketch given to Sir Hans Sloane in 1736 Sheldrake explained that as a youth his leisure had been spent in drawing and painting. He was not successful as a saddler, and, when unemployed, studied natural history. A series of letters written from Norwich to the gardener and botanist Thomas Fairchild (1667&#150;1729) demonstrates his interest in botanical subjects, notably the cultivation of tropical fruit and nut-bearing trees. Needing an occupation, he took over a distilling office adjacent to his saddlery, and found himself required to study botany, chemistry, and the manufacture of drugs. At the same time, he gained a small knowledge of medicine, sometimes being improperly known as MD, and his affairs prospered.<br>
<br>By this time Sheldrake and his wife, Mary, had baptized two children at St Peter Mancroft, Norwich&#151;Timothy on 8 February 1729 and Anne on 18 June 1732. When an act was passed in 1736 restricting the sale of distilled spirits, apothecaries were not affected, and Sheldrake wrote to Sloane seeking his advice, as he needed to keep his business going to support a young family. Shortly after, perhaps on Sloane's advice, he moved to Westminster and settled near the Strand.<br>
<br>Sheldrake's interest in tropical plants led him to send a letter on the causes of heat and cold in all climates, which was read to the Royal Society and published in 1756, and to draw up a large chart entitled <span class="italic">The gardener's best companion in a greenhouse, or, Tables showing the greatest heat and cold of all countries &hellip; measured upon the thermometer</span> (1756), dedicated to Sloane and stated to have the approval of Philip Miller. These tables were based on Sheldrake's na&iuml;ve assumption that temperature at a particular place on the earth was directly related to its latitude. A posthumous work, <span class="italic">Botanicum Medicinale: an Herbal of Medicinal Plants on the College of Physicians' List</span> (1759), gave names in nine languages and was illustrated by 120 copper plates, mostly engraved by C. H. Hemerich, and said to be &#145;from the exquisite drawings of the late ingenious T. Sheldrake&#146;. The work was issued at &pound;3 plain and &pound;6 coloured. A pamphlet by Sheldrake on the &#145;Norwich Gothic cross&#146; was advertised in the <span class="italic">Gardener's Companion</span>. No details of his death are known.<br>
<br>Sheldrake's son Timothy (1729&#150;1800), lived in the Strand, Westminster, and practised as a truss maker. Known as &#145;the elder&#146;, he and his common-law wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1813), had several children, of whom the eldest son, Timothy Sheldrake the younger (<i>b</i>. 1759), also practised as a truss maker, and was employed by the Westminster Hospital and Marylebone Infirmary. The younger Sheldrake was not medically qualified but the high cost of his appliances gained him a considerable reputation, and he travelled through Britain attending to children of the richer classes. He was latterly in partnership with Henry Bigg. His brother William (<i>b</i>. 1770) also practised orthopaedics, and treated Byron's club foot, though apparently without much success.<br>
