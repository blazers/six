<span class="headword">Altham,  Harry Surtees</span>  (1888&#150;1965), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and cricket historian</span>, was born at 8 The Terrace, York Town, Frimley, Surrey, on 30 November 1888, the younger son of Sir Edward Altham Altham (1856&#150;1943), army officer, and his wife, Georgina Emily (1855&#150;1945), daughter of W. Macpherson Nicol, of Inverness. His father was the first university candidate for the army, in 1876, and retired with the rank of lieutenant-general, having served as quartermaster-general in India (1917&#150;19). Altham was educated at Repton School, where he showed himself a gifted cricketer and natural leader, and he remained devoted to the school for the rest of his life. In the opinion of a number of good judges, the side which he captained in 1908 challenges that of 1905 as the best English school cricket eleven ever. He made his d&eacute;but in first-class cricket, for Surrey against Leicestershire, at the Oval in August 1908, and after the First World War played also for Hampshire from 1919 to 1923. After going up to Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1912, he gained his cricket blue in 1911 and 1912. In May 1913 he became an assistant master at Winchester College, and apart from war service with the 5th King's Royal Rifle Corps, during which he was appointed to the DSO, awarded the MC, and three times mentioned in dispatches, he lived in Winchester for the rest of his life. On 27 June 1917 he married (Winifred) Alison (1889&#150;1979), daughter of Somerville Reid Livingstone-Learmonth, sheep farmer in Australia; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In his chosen profession as schoolmaster Altham found supreme happiness and complete fulfilment. He felt an instinctive sympathy for the young, and for over fifty years infected young Wykehamists with his own vitality and optimism, and with his simple belief that life was there to be lived with zest, courage, and conviction. He had, too, the great teacher's priceless gift of being able to communicate to others his delight in the things he valued&#151;a play by Shakespeare, maybe, or a poem by Browning or Housman, a trifid spoon, an illuminated capital, a well-executed on-drive, or a well-loved feature in the cathedral at Winchester, which he served as editor of its <span class="italic">Record</span> from 1948 onwards. When Altham was &#145;on form&#146; and involved, his eyes would light up and his hands move, as he caught the humour or the happiness of the moment with an allusive comment, a warm reflection, or a lively quip.<br>
<br>Altham was, perhaps, most at home, apart from home itself, in the classroom, on the cricket field&#151;though cricket was only <i>primus inter pares</i> of several games that he enjoyed and excelled at&#151;and in Chernocke House, or Furley's, as it is known colloquially, of which, wonderfully supported by his wife, he was housemaster between 1927 and 1947. This was for him an especially happy period, when a whole set of shared assumptions had yet to be questioned and when those under him could react instinctively to his concern both for them and for the values he hoped they would accept.<br>
<br>Altham's influence on cricket was profound. On returning to Winchester after the war in 1919 he quickly showed that that influence would not be parochial, for he found time, while teaching in term and playing for Hampshire in the summer holidays, to write <span class="italic">A History of Cricket</span> (1926) which John Arlott found &#145;remarkable for its scope, perception and mature style&#146;. Subsequent editions were published in collaboration with E. W. Swanton. Altham regarded as of great importance his editorship and authorship of large parts of <span class="italic">The M.C.C. Cricket Coaching Book</span> (1952), the outcome of the rhetorical question asked at a meeting of the MCC committee by him and G. O. Allen, &#145;What does MCC do to encourage and help the young to play cricket?&#146; It was thus a seminal work, used as the coach's bible for several decades. Altham was also joint author of <span class="italic">Hampshire County Cricket</span> (1957) and regularly contributed to <span class="italic">Wisden</span>, <span class="italic">The Cricketer</span> (in which his <span class="italic">History of Cricket</span> first appeared in serial form in 1922), <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, <span class="italic">World of Cricket</span> (1966), county cricket club handbooks, and various publications in Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>In addition Altham made a notable contribution to the cricketing scene as an administrator, an after-dinner speaker of real distinction&#151;at, for instance, the centenary dinners of Hampshire County Cricket Club in 1962 and Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1963&#151;and an unrepentant advocate of what cricket could do for the young in terms of character and enjoyment. He was a successful MCC president in 1959&#150;60, treasurer from 1950 until 1963, and member of the committee for close on a quarter of a century; he was chairman (in 1949) of the MCC cricket inquiry committee which pioneered <span class="italic">The M.C.C. Cricket Coaching Book</span> of 1952; and although not himself a test player, he was chairman of the test selection committee in 1954. He helped to found the MCC youth cricket association and became its first chairman (1952&#150;65), being the &#145;head and right arm&#146; of the coaching courses at Lilleshall, where he was in his element as companion, conversationalist, and coach. He was the first president of the English Schools' Cricket Association (1951&#150;7); and, even more satisfying, perhaps, president of the Hampshire County Cricket Club from 1947 until his death. Hampshire's first county championship win in 1961 owed much to his inspiration. It is fair to say that few people can have given back to a game so much of what they have taken from it. He was appointed CBE in 1957.<br>
<br>Altham died suddenly at 363 Fulwood Road, Sheffield, on 11 March 1965, some two hours after addressing the Sheffield Cricket Lovers' Society. He was buried on 20 March at Morn Hill cemetery, Winchester. There is a tablet to his memory in the memorial gallery at Lord's.<br>
