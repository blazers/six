<span class="headword">Applegarth,  Robert</span>  (1834&#150;1924), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born in Kingston upon Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire on 26 January 1834, the son of Robert Applegarth, who was engaged in the whaling trade. Robert had no formal education and began work at the age of ten. After a number of juvenile jobs he began work in a local joiner's shop and acquired the skills of a carpenter although he was never officially apprenticed. In 1852 he moved with his mother to Sheffield, where she died after a few months. Three years later, on 20 August 1855, Robert married Mary, the daughter of Stephen Longmoore, a farmer, but within a few months he left for America in order to improve his position. His wife, for health reasons, stayed in England.<br>
<br>America had a powerful impact upon Applegarth. He appreciated the openness of American society compared with that of Britain and he also became a strong abolitionist. He might have stayed there (he was in Galesburg, Knox County, Illinois) but for his wife's health. When he returned he joined the local carpenters' union, and in 1861 he persuaded his Sheffield union to become part of the newly established Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASCJ). A year later he became the general secretary, a position he was to hold until 1871. These were years of growth in power and status for the skilled unions of mid-Victorian Britain, and Applegarth established himself among the leading union personalities of his day. His own union grew from 1000 when he first took office to 10,000 within a decade.<br>
<br>A radically minded Liberal, Applegarth was at the centre of all the political and industrial issues of the 1860s: the vigorous support for the north in the American Civil War; the agitation for the repeal of the master and servant acts; the political aims of the Reform League; and after union affairs his main concerns were the co-operative movement and a national system of education for working people.<br>
<br>Applegarth joined the International Working Men's Association (the First International) in January 1865, a few months after its foundation, and at the third congress in Brussels in June 1868 he was elected chairman of the general council. In this high-profile role he was the subject of some interesting comments in letters from Karl Marx to Friedrich Engels. Applegarth's main activity at the end of the 1860s, however, was concerned with the legal status of trade unions. The royal commission which was established to review the whole situation included two sympathetic members&#151;Frederic Harrison and Thomas Hughes&#151;and Applegarth worked closely with them as a counter to the evidence of individual employers and their association. He himself was the first, and most important, trade unionist to present evidence to the commission, and he made a powerful impression upon its members. The final report was as satisfactory as could be expected.<br>
<br>In 1870 Applegarth was war correspondent in the Franco-Prussian war for the <span class="italic">Sheffield Independent</span>, <span class="italic">Scotsman</span>, and <span class="italic">New York World</span>. In the early 1870s his career as a trade union leader came to an end. He had accepted membership of the royal commission on contagious diseases&#151;the first working man ever to be appointed in this capacity&#151;but this led to fierce opposition from within the union's executive, and Applegarth resigned in April 1871. The opposition against him was straight prejudice, and a commentary upon the social conservatism of mid-Victorian trade unionists.<br>
<br>The interesting thing is that while Applegarth did not return to his trade, or to the union movement, he retained his political radicalism to the end of his days: for another fifty years. He became a successful businessman, on a small scale, with a continuing faith in the co-operative movement, and above all a consistent advocate of compulsory, free, and unsectarian education.<br>
<br>Applegarth was small in stature, only 5 feet 2 inches tall. His first wife died in 1870. Two sons aged fifteen and four, and a daughter of one year old, were mentioned in the 1871 census, but according to another source, he had five children to support  (Humphrey). In summer 1871 he married Sophia Anne Huitson (1843&#150;1915), of Lambeth, Surrey, with whom he had a daughter, Grace Edith (<i>bap</i>. 1875, <i>d</i>. 1965). The couple appear to have separated, though they did not divorce, as Sophia and Grace were recorded in census returns from 1881 no longer living with Applegarth; in the 1911 census he was recorded as a &#145;widower&#146;. Applegarth died at his home, 23 Parchmore Road, Thornton Heath, Surrey, on 13 July 1924. Trade union leaders, among them Ben Tillett, gave the funeral addresses at a secular service. In 1917 he had rejected the invitation to become a Companion of Honour, preferring, as he wrote to Lloyd George, to remain &#145;plain Robert Applegarth&#146;. A newspaper obituary mentioned four children living at the time of his death.<br>
