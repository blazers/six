<span class="headword">&Oacute; N&eacute;ill,  &Eacute;inr&iacute;</span> <span class="st"> [Henry O'Neill, &Eacute;inr&iacute; Aimhr&eacute;idh, Harry Avery]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1392), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50029/', "Niall M&#243;r &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1397)")</script>, king or chief of T&iacute;r Eoghain, and his wife, Beanmidhe (<i>d</i>. 1385), daughter of a Mac Mathghamhna chief. He was nicknamed &Eacute;inr&iacute; Aimhr&eacute;idh (Henry the Turbulent or Henry the Contentious) and was long remembered in Ulster folklore as Harry Avery. Evidence that his sobriquet was not bestowed on him, as the annals of Connacht flatteringly allege, <i>per antiphrasim</i>, comes in a letter to his father, Niall M&oacute;r, dated 18 July 1375, in which Milo Sweteman, archbishop of Armagh, complained: &#145;your degenerate sons Henricus and Catholicus [C&uacute; Uladh Ruadh], hunters ordained by the devil, are raping the wives of divers husbands and their handmaidens with them&#146;  (register of Milo Sweteman, fol. 27<i>r</i>), causing the citizens and tenants of Armagh to threaten emigration.<br>
<br>Subsequently &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill is found in western T&iacute;r Eoghain, on the borders of Fermanagh and T&iacute;r Conaill (the Donegal area). In 1379 he inflicted a defeat on the men of Fermanagh and in 1380 intervened in the succession struggles of T&iacute;r Conaill to enable his brother-in-law, Toirdhealbhach an Fh&iacute;ona &Oacute; Domhnaill (<i>d</i>. 1423), to become king there. He appears to have exercised authority over the area around the modern Newtownstewart, in Tyrone, where his sons and grandsons, known as the Sliocht &Eacute;inr&iacute; (&#145;descendants of Henry&#146;) or Slughte Henry Avery O'Neill, held sway subsequently and where the ruin called Harry Avery's Castle is traditionally associated with his rule (the implied date being accepted as possible by modern archaeologists). &Oacute; N&eacute;ill married a kinswoman, Aiffric (<i>d</i>. 1389), the daughter of Aodh &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. The year of her death saw the first recorded raid by one of their sons against a vassal of &Oacute; Domhnaill.<br>
<br>In contrast to his sons, who turned against both &Oacute; Domhnaill and Niall M&oacute;r, &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was a loyal supporter of his father and of his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55287/', "Niall &#211;g &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1403)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50029/', "&#211; N&#233;ill, Niall M&#243;r")</script>]. In March 1390 he yielded his second son as a hostage for the release of Niall &Oacute;g, captured in battle by the Anglo-Irish the previous year. This son, soon ransomed, may be identical with Domhnall Bog &Oacute; N&eacute;ill (<i>d</i>. 1432), the future king of T&iacute;r Eoghain, who, after the death of his brother Briain M&oacute;r in 1402, emerged as the leader of &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's descendants, and seized the kingship from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20782/', "Eoghan &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1456)")</script>, son of Niall &Oacute;g &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. Other sons of &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill are named as Aodh (<i>fl</i>. 1412), Niall Ruadh (<i>d</i>. 1430/1432), Se&aacute;n, Ruaidhr&iacute;, and &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute;g. &Eacute;inr&iacute; Aimhr&eacute;idh &Oacute; N&eacute;ill died on 16 May 1392. Described by most annalists as worthy to succeed his brother in the kingship and praised for his extravagant generosity, he was criticized by Aughuist&iacute;n Magraidhin (<i>d</i>. 1405) as &#145;an unjust, wicked and sinful man&#146;  (&Oacute; hInnse, no. 8, 147).<br>
