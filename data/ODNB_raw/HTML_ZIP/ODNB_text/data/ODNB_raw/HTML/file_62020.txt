<span class="headword">Beynon, Sir  (William John) Granville</span>  (1914&#150;1996), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 24 May 1914 at Pen-y-bryn, Dunvant, a suburb of Swansea, Glamorgan, the youngest of the four children of William Beynon, a colliery checkweighman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas. His parents were both Welsh and his father was a tall, sandy-haired, good-humoured, courageous man of impressive personality, a pillar of the community, with his manipulative skills as an &#145;ambulance man&#146; being in great demand. When nine-year-old Granville fell from the parapet of Oystermouth Castle during a Sunday school outing and broke both his arms, his father set the bones and made the splints that resulted in a complete healing.<br>
<br>On completing his primary education at the village school Beynon entered Gowerton Boys' Grammar School, and, in 1931, the University College of Swansea, a constituent of the federal University of Wales. There he graduated with first-class honours in physics in 1934, and proceeded to research under the supervision of Professor E. J. Evans. In his early teens he tinkered with clocks, bicycles, and radios, took a keen interest in rugby football, and was sent by his parents for violin lessons. Later in his teens he and his father built a crystal radio; using it, he heard a Saturday night broadcast on science by E. V. (Edward) Appleton, with whom he later worked. At twelve he became a member of a band of young musicians called Urdd y Pobl Bach (the guild of young people) organized by the wife of a local solicitor, Arthur Morgan James, whose daughter, Megan Medi James, was also a member. Megan James also graduated with first-class honours in physics at Swansea. She and Granville Beynon were married at Ebenezer Congregational Chapel, Swansea, on 31 July 1942. They had a daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>Although E. J. Evans was not himself a distinguished researcher, he knew how to inspire and encourage promising students, several of whom became fellows of the Royal Society. After Beynon's death his wife found among his papers a much folded letter written in 1938 by Evans shortly after Beynon had started working at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL): &#145;I believe you have the ability to go far if you persevere. Always look for the unexpected. E. J.&#146;  (private information). Following graduation Beynon's PhD studies at Swansea under Evans were concerned with the natural and magneto-optical dispersions of organic liquids, mainly alkanols. They demanded painstaking measurement and quantitative analytical treatment, which Beynon took in his stride. Three of the four publications to emerge from his thesis work appeared in his own name in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>This work was, however, far removed from, and quite unrelated to, that which Beynon pursued upon his appointment in January 1938 to the radio division (based at Ditton Park, Slough) of the NPL. By the late 1930s measurements of the ionosphere had revealed much; but there was an exigent need to understand the manner in which radio waves (of various wavelengths) were transmitted through the ionosphere to varying distances over the earth. This was the investigation on which Beynon, in conjunction with Edward Appleton, was first engaged at the Slough laboratory of the NPL. Two definitive papers under their joint authorship were published in the 1940s, dealing with theoretical and practical investigations of the reflection of radio waves incident obliquely on the ionosphere. These papers formed the basis for the UK method of predicting the conditions for radio-wave propagation. Although his collaboration with Appleton continued to be strong Beynon also discovered (at Slough) in work that was exclusively his own the earliest indication of horizontal motions in the ionosphere: in the so-called F<sub>2</sub> layer of the ionosphere between 200 and 350 km above the earth there is an east-west flow with a velocity of 430 km per hour.<br>
<br>After his return to a lectureship post at Swansea in 1946 (the year before Appleton received the Nobel prize for work on the physics of the upper atmosphere) Beynon continued to collaborate with Appleton on radio-wave absorptions and lunar tidal oscillations in the ionosphere. Both at Swansea, where he was assisted from 1947 by a younger colleague, G. M. Brown, and at Aberystwyth (another constituent college of the University of Wales), where he became professor and head of department in 1958, Beynon studied the &#145;winter anomaly&#146; in ionospheric absorption, a phenomenon first reported in the mid-1930s. Collaboration with Brown, who also joined the staff at Aberystwyth, flourished. Their joint editorial work&#151;including the production of the forty-eight volumes of the <span class="italic">Annals of the International Geophysical Year</span> (1957&#150;8), arising from a major geophysical study over the sunspot maximum period, and the single volume <span class="italic">Solar Eclipses and the Ionosphere</span> (1956)&#151;made them key figures in the ionospheric literature.<br>
<br>One of Beynon's great strengths as an experimentalist was the speed with which he identified and applied the potential of new techniques. This was exemplified by his use in the period 1968 to 1974 of the available Skylark, Skua, and Petrel rockets, launched from Australia and the Hebrides, for the refined measurement of radio-wave transmissions. His extraordinary effectiveness in designing and orchestrating international collaborations using rocket experiments throughout the 1970s involved experiments undertaken by his own group at Aberystwyth with teams from the NPL at Slough, Queen's University, Belfast, the Swedish Meteorological Institute at Stockholm, the University of Saskatchewan, and the Max Planck Institute of Heidelberg.<br>
<br>Of even greater significance was Beynon's early appreciation of the versatility of the incoherent radar scatter technique and its future value to his research programme at Aberystwyth and other centres in the UK. When J. J. Thomson (discoverer of the electron) showed in 1906 that electromagnetic waves were incoherently scattered by electrons he also showed that the extent of the scattering (its so-called cross-section) was minute. What Beynon was quick to appreciate nearly sixty years later was that, with the availability of powerful radar sources and ever more sensitive means of detecting scattered photons, a vital role could be played in ionospheric research by the incoherent scatter technique. A national incoherent scatter radar facility was established initially in 1970 by collaboration between the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth, and the NPL at Slough. This trio was the first to measure three components of the plasma velocity in both E and F regions of the ionosphere. The emergence of the enlarged body (involving the research councils of six nations) that constituted the European Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility (EISCAT), of which Beynon was regarded as the father, culminated in its official inauguration in 1981 in the presence of King Karl Gustav of Sweden.<br>
<br>Beynon's persuasive qualities, sense of humour, clear-headedness, and sheer ability appealed to scientists from widely different cultures. It explains why he was <i>persona grata</i> as much in Moscow as in Washington, and why he was elected to so many key committees: he was president of the International Union of Radio Science, and of the Special Committee for the International Years of the Quiet Sun, and a member of the national committee for space research of the Science and Engineering Research Council; he was also a member of Antarctic Research, Geodesy and Geophysics, and the International Council of Scientific Union. His role in international co-operation in solar-terrestrial physics was further enhanced during his editorship from 1976 to 1989 of the <span class="italic">Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics</span>. He was also vitally interested in secondary and tertiary education. For eleven years he chaired the schools council committee for Wales and he also served as president of the education section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. From 1972 to 1974 he was vice-principal of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He was appointed CBE in 1959, elected FRS in 1973, and knighted in 1976. He received many honours and awards, including the Goddard prize of the National Space Club of America, and the Chree medal of the Institute of Physics.<br>
<br>Beynon was a devoted family man who greatly enjoyed music-making with his wife Megan and three children: Margaret, Meurig, and James. He also had a strong sense of community. During the depression of the 1930s, while still a student, he founded a social club and helped organize summer camps for the unemployed in his village, Dunvant. While a lecturer at the university in Swansea he trained his village chapel choir, which for several years performed Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> on Palm Sunday. At Aberystwyth in the early 1970s he was co-founder of, and an accomplished first violinist in, the Philomusica Orchestra of Aberystwyth, made up of musicians from &#145;town and gown&#146;. Among his enormous circle of friends he was admired for his open personality, story-telling gifts, sense of humour, and prodigiously energetic gardening. Countless thousands of undergraduates taught by him at Swansea and Aberystwyth remembered him as one of the best lecturers they ever heard. He died of heart failure at the Abermad Nursing Home, Llanilar, Aberystwyth, on 11 March 1996. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
