<span class="headword">Lindsay,  John</span>  (1685/6&#150;1768), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was probably a kinsman of Robert Lindsey, father of the Unitarian minister Theophilus Lindsey of Middlewich in Cheshire. Although he is described in his epitaph as an alumnus of Oxford, his name does not appear in the records of the university. After acting as attorney-at-law in Cheshire, he was admitted into holy orders among the nonjurors, although the date of his admission is unknown. In 1727 he was living in Islington, and appears to have acted as chaplain to Lady Fanshaw at her house in Little Ormond Street, about 1728. In 1741 he moved to Pear Tree Street, near St Luke's, Old Street, where he lived quietly, dividing his time between study and gardening. He officiated in London for many years as minister of the nonjuring society in Trinity Chapel, Aldersgate Street, and was reputedly their last minister, and among the last of the nonjurors. He is also said to have acted as corrector of the press for the printer William Bowyer the younger. Lindsay was married, although the date of his marriage is unknown. His wife's name was Mary, and she predeceased him by over forty years, dying in 1727 at the age of forty-three.<br>
<br>As a nonjuror Lindsay was involved in controversy with the mainstream Church of England, and his various works tend to reflect this, dealing with subjects such as episcopal and royal succession. Also typical of nonjuring sympathies was his account of the character of the &#145;Royal Martyr&#146; Charles I, in reply to attacks on that monarch made in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (February 1758). Like most nonjurors Lindsay was often accused of being partial to Catholicism, but his <span class="italic">Seasonable Anecdote Against Apostasy</span> (1758), which is strongly anti-Catholic, seems to disprove this.<br>
<br>Lindsay's translation of Thomas Mason's <span class="italic">Vindicatio ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> (1728) was valued for the preface he added, which contains a comprehensive account of the episcopal succession in all the English bishoprics, as well as an early sermon by Mason. Other works by Lindsay include a history of England, two parallel dialogues in support of the nonjuring position, and works of biblical commentary. Lindsay died on 21 June 1768, aged eighty-two, and was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Islington, alongside his wife; they were together commemorated in a Latin epitaph.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> article on John Lindsay concluded with a brief memoir of his namesake, but apparently no relation, <a name="cosubject_16708"></a><span class="headword">John Lindsay</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1758&#150;1759), <span class="occ">naval chaplain and writer</span>, who served as the chaplain in the <i>Forgueux</i> during Augustus Keppel's attack on Goree in September 1758. In the following year he published <span class="italic">A Voyage to the Coast of Africa</span> with details of this engagement; other works attributed to him are <span class="italic">A Voyage to Senegal</span> and &#145;Sir John Tostle, a Poem&#146;. This John Lindsay's brother, William, served as a brigade major in Lord Ancrum's dragoons and was killed in action during the Seven Years' War.<br>
