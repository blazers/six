<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Greenwood,  Joan Mary Waller</span>  (1921&#150;1987), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 4 March 1921 at 122 Fulham Road, Chelsea, London, the only child of Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood, artist, and his wife, Ida Waller. The name Mary does not appear on her birth certificate. She was educated at St Catherine's School in Bramley, Surrey, and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She first appeared on stage in 1939, when she was seventeen, in a small part in <span class="italic">The Robust Invalid</span>, a translation of Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le malade imaginaire</span> at the Apollo Theatre, London, and two years later in an unimportant film, <span class="italic">John Smith Wakes Up</span>.<br>
<br>Thereafter Joan Greenwood was much in demand on both stage and screen, in every sort of production. Her first major film was <span class="italic">The Gentle Sex</span> in 1943, directed by Leslie Howard, as one of a group of conscripts in the ATS (Auxiliary Training Service). Her first leading part was in a comedy of 1946 called <span class="italic">A Girl in a Million</span>, playing opposite Hugh Williams. It took her longer to make her mark in the theatre. During the war she took over from Deborah Kerr in <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span>, toured with ENSA (the Entertainments National Service Association), did a season with Worthing Repertory Company, and toured with the company run by Donald Wolfit, playing Ophelia in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and Celia in <span class="italic">Volpone</span>. For several years after the war she concentrated on the cinema, becoming well known to the general public when she had roles in a number of Ealing films. <span class="italic">Saraband for Dead Lovers</span> (1948) was a historical romance with Stewart Granger, then at the height of his popularity. Her light touch as a comedian was particularly suitable for the gentle Ealing comedies of the day and she appeared in three of the best: <span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span> (1948), <span class="italic">The Man in the White Suit</span> (1951), and, above all, <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span> (1949). In 1952 she was a piquant Gwendolen in the elegant film of <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>, directed by Anthony Asquith.<br>
<br>In the United States, Joan Greenwood appeared in New York and made two disappointing films in Hollywood, where she disliked the lifestyle. On her return to London, after taking over from Lilli Palmer in <span class="italic">Bell, Book and Candle</span> at the Phoenix Theatre in 1955, she scored two critical successes with <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span> at the Royal Court Theatre in 1957, later transferred to the West End, and <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> at the Oxford Playhouse in 1960, which was repeated in the West End in 1964. When appearing in <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> at Oxford, at the age of thirty-nine, she surprised everyone by eloping to Jamaica and secretly marrying an older fellow member of the cast, Andr&eacute; Cecil Morell formerly Mesritz (1909&#150;1978), son of Andr&eacute; Cecil Mesritz. They had one son, Jason, also an actor.<br>
<br>Joan Greenwood appeared at the Chichester festival of 1962 in <span class="italic">The Broken Heart</span>, and the following year in the film <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span>, Tony Richardson's rip-roaring adaptation from the novel by Henry Fielding. This, however, was the last big film in which she had a role of any importance. She appeared in a few minor productions, the last being a partly animated Anglo-Polish version of <span class="italic">The Water Babies</span> which, despite a wonderful cast, was disappointingly flat. She later returned to the screen in 1987, the year of her death, for a small cameo part in the distinguished film <span class="italic">Little Dorrit</span>. On the stage she gave a fine performance in <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span> in 1971 but, like her film career, her stage career virtually ended when she was in her mid-fifties, although she did appear in several television series later than this. She also returned to the stage later to take over the part in <span class="italic">The Understanding</span> played by Dame Celia Johnson, when the latter died in 1982.<br>
<br>A versatile actress and a talented comedian, Joan Greenwood appeared in everything from sophisticated comedy, romance, and adventure to classical drama and even revue. Only 5 feet tall, slight, and with dazzling blonde hair, she was both sophisticated and elfin, quizzical and mocking, with her full pouting mouth and lingering glance. Her distinctive voice and almost exaggerated diction have been described as &#145;gargling with champagne&#146;, husky, purring, deliciously seductive. Her work as an intelligent and witty comedian endeared her to a discriminating minority, and her films, especially the Ealing comedies, brought her a wider public. However, both on stage and screen her career seems to have been strangely uneven. Perhaps the very distinctiveness of her style limited the opportunities offered to her. The strength and emotional power of her Lysistrata and even more her Hedda Gabler suggest possibilities not realized in the rest of her career. Joan Greenwood died of acute bronchitis and asthma on 27 February 1987, at her home, 27 Slaidburn Street, Chelsea, London.<br>
