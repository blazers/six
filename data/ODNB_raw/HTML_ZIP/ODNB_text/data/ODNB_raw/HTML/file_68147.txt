<span class="headword">Lambert,  Harold Ernest</span>  (1893&#150;1967), <span class="occ">Swahili scholar and ethnographer</span>, was born on 4 September 1893 at Pield Heath, Hillingdon, Middlesex, the second of three sons of George Lambert (1863&#150;1915), gardener, and Amy Hearn (1868/9&#150;1937), both of Hillingdon. Lambert attended Bournemouth School from 1905 to 1912 when he was admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge, as a minor scholar. On the outbreak of the First World War he was commissioned temporary lieutenant in the Gloucestershire regiment in 1916; in 1917 he was seconded to the King's African rifles. His name remained on the college books for the duration, but it seems that he never took his degree.<br>
<br>In April 1919 Lambert was appointed temporary assistant district commissioner in the East Africa Protectorate (renamed the colony and protectorate of Kenya in the following year), the appointment being confirmed in 1923. For the next two years he was stationed at Shimoni, which was close to the island of Wasini, a stronghold of Swahili culture, where Lambert acquired his mastery of kiVumba (the local dialect of Swahili), composed poetry in that dialect, and learned to write Swahili in Swahili-Arabic script. He was referred to by the local literati as Shaykh Lambert, and people later recalled with approval that during the fasting month of Ramadan he did not eat, drink, or smoke in public during the hours of daylight. He also had a reputation for being neatly dressed. On 9 June 1925, while on leave in England, he married Grace Beatrice (1885&#150;1972), daughter of Tom Firr, formerly huntsman with the Quorn hounds. In 1929, for some six months, he was district commissioner of Lamu, on the coast north of Mombasa and, like Wasini, a stronghold of Swahili culture. There he sat at the feet of Muhammad Kijumwa al-Bakri, an exceptional poet and scholar. In 1939 Lambert was made OBE; in his recommendation, the governor, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, wrote: &#145;Wherever he serves he succeeds in winning the full confidence of Settlers and Natives alike.&#146; From 1944 until his retirement in 1950 he was seconded to the African settlement and land utilization board in Nairobi, during which time he prepared ethnographic material on the peoples of the Meru and Embu districts, and on the Kikuyu. A good example of this phase is his <span class="italic">Social and Political Institutions of the Kikuyu</span> (1955). During Lambert's career he trained a number of colonial administrators, such as Richard Turnbull and Walter Coutts, who later held important posts.<br>
<br>Able though Lambert was in matters anthropological, it was his mastery of Swahili as spoken by the Swahili people on which his claim to fame rests (a mastery which was all the more amazing since he had served only twice at the coast, and then for comparatively short periods). He began to make his erudite contributions to the <span class="italic">Journal of the East African Swahili Committee</span> only in the early 1950s, after his retirement. His three <span class="italic">Studies in Swahili Dialects</span> (1956&#150;8) remain, like the <span class="italic">Grammaire des dialectes swahilis</span> (1909) by Charles Sacleux, outstanding; and <span class="italic">Wimbo wa kiEbrania</span> (&#145;Hebraic Songs&#146;), based on the erotic <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>, is a clever <i>jeu d'esprit</i>. A collection of Lambert's Swahili poems appeared posthumously in 1971. He and W. E. Taylor were the only Europeans ever to have published Swahili poetry acceptable to the Swahili.<br>
<br>H. E. died in Nairobi on 28 May 1967. Grace died in Nairobi on 15 April 1972. There were no children. It is relevant to add that few foreign scholars have any reputation among the Swahili people themselves, although the names of Krapf and Taylor are invariably recognized. It is with these that H. E. will be remembered.<br>
