<span class="headword">Boyle,  Henry Edmund Gaskin</span>  (1875&#150;1941), <span class="occ">anaesthetist</span>, was born on 2 April 1875 in Christ Church, Barbados, the only child of Henry Eudolphus Boyle, manager of the Hope and Bannatyne estates in Christ Church, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Benjamin Law Gaskin, a member of the Barbados house of assembly. Boyle attended the local schools of Codrington and Harrison before leaving Barbados for England in 1894 and enrolling at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school, London. He qualified MRCS LRCP in 1901. An intensely loyal &#145;Barts man&#146;, Boyle was a keen sportsman and played both rugby and cricket for the hospital.<br>
<br>Boyle's first post, in August 1901, was as casualty officer at Bristol Royal Infirmary. He returned to Barts as junior resident anaesthetist in April 1902 and was appointed senior resident administrator of anaesthetics in 1905 at a salary of &pound;350 per annum. Later that year he became non-resident assistant administrator of the department of anaesthetics. During this time he wrote a popular textbook entitled <span class="italic">Practical Anaesthetics</span> (1907), which went through two further editions. On 1 October 1925 he became anaesthetist to St Bartholomew's Hospital; he resigned on health grounds in February 1939, and the following July he was elected to the honorary position of consulting anaesthetist to the hospital, a position he filled until his death.<br>
<br>In his initial researches, with Somnoform, Boyle developed an apparatus for its administration; however, the drug never became popular. He then worked with intratracheal insufflation techniques before developing what was to become his most famous contribution to anaesthesia: a continuous-flow oxygen, nitrous oxide, and ether apparatus. In 1912 Boyle met the New York anaesthetist James T. Gwathmey, who had designed a continuous-flow anaesthetic apparatus that included a water-sight flow-meter for oxygen and nitrous oxide. He persuaded Boyle to obtain one of these devices, and having used it Boyle then asked Coxeters to manufacture a similar apparatus that would have a gas tight fitting for English cylinders (a problem with the Gwathmey machine). Known as Boyle's nitrous oxide-oxygen-ether outfit, it was first used at Barts in September 1917 and a short report describing its use in more than 3600 cases appeared in 1919. Over the next two decades Boyle constantly modified this apparatus. Further refinements took place after his death, and although the name of &#145;Boyle's machine&#146; was dropped it remained essentially as he had designed it throughout the rest of the century. Boyle had been made a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps in September 1914, and he was appointed OBE in 1920 because of his work in caring for wounded soldiers in London during the war. He made other important contributions to anaesthesia, developing a special laryngotomy tube and then the Boyle&#150;Davis gag that was used for decades in tonsil surgery. He also introduced one of the first Sorensen electrical suction apparatuses ever used in Britain.<br>
<br>Boyle married a widow, Mildred Ethel Green, daughter of John William Wildy, of Coutts Bank, on 3 September 1910. He had one stepdaughter. Affectionately known as Cocky, he was a man of great personal charm, a social person renowned for his rotund frame, hearty laugh, and fund of amusing stories. He entertained lavishly and this might have accounted for his considerable financial difficulties later in life. He received no financial gain from any of his inventions. Boyle was a founder member of the editorial board of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Anaesthesia</span>, an original member of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, and one of the first two examiners for the diploma in anaesthesia. He was a member of the Society of Anaesthetists that evolved into the anaesthetic section of the Royal Society of Medicine. He was a staunch supporter of this latter group and was elected president for 1923. He was created FRCS in 1935.<br>
<br>Boyle died in London on 15 October 1941 at the Royal Cancer Hospital, Chelsea. He was cremated two days later at Golders Green, and was survived by his wife. In January 2000, the department of anaesthesia at St Bartholomew's Hospital was renamed the Boyle department of anaesthesia.<br>
