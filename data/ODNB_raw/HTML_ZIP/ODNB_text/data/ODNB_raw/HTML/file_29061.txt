<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wentworth,  William Charles</span>  (1790&#150;1872), <span class="occ">politician and landowner in Australia</span>, was born on 13 August 1790 on board the <i>Surprize</i>, in harbour at Cascade Bay, Norfolk Island, Pacific Ocean, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52455/', "D'Arcy Wentworth (1762&#150;1827)")</script>, a surgeon from Portadown, co. Armagh, and his mistress, Catherine Crowley (1772&#150;1800), a felon.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>The family went to Sydney in 1796 and thence to Parramatta, where they settled. Catherine Crowley died in 1800. Late in 1802 Wentworth was sent with his brother D'Arcy to England, where they were educated from 1803 at the Revd Mr Midgley's school at Bletchley. From 1805 to 1809 Wentworth attended Dr Alexander Crombie's institution at Greenwich. Having abandoned ideas of becoming a naval midshipman or a cadet in the East India Company, Wentworth embarked for New South Wales in October 1809, rather at a loss as to his future. A familiar figure in Sydney, he was tall and broad, and wore his auburn hair like a mane. He could speak with a brilliance that befitted a scion of the whig aristocracy and seemed something of a Gulliver in Lilliput. And yet his features were coarse, his appearance was untidy, his gait was clumsy, and his language at times resembled that of a convict brat. In October 1811 Governor Lachlan Macquarie appointed him acting provost-marshal and in 1812 Wentworth established his estate, Vermont, on a grant of 1750 acres by the Nepean River. Knowing that a number of the free immigrants (the &#145;exclusives&#146;) wanted to exclude former convicts (the &#145;emancipists&#146;) from positions of trust and influence in the colony, he set out to become more powerful than those who had slighted his family.<br>
<br>In May 1813 Wentworth accompanied William Lawson and Gregory Blaxland in the first great feat of inland exploration, the crossing of the Blue Mountains. The discovery enabled pastoral expansion, and Wentworth was rewarded with a further 1000 acres. To help his father secure valuable sandalwood from a Pacific island, he joined a schooner as supercargo in 1814. He was nearly killed by natives at Rarotonga while courageously attempting to save a sailor whom they clubbed to death. Wentworth helped to bring the ship safely to Sydney. If much of what he did was stamped with majesty, he could none the less be mean and underhand. In 1816 a scroll of satirical verse was found in the streets of Sydney. It lampooned the lieutenant-governor, Colonel George Molle, not least for being Macquarie's secret enemy. Protracted enquiries revealed that Wentworth had composed the lines before departing for London in March.<br>
<br>To prepare himself to be &#145;the instrument of procuring a free constitution for my country&#146;, Wentworth entered the Middle Temple in February 1817. For a time he was characteristically restless. He petitioned the Colonial Office to allow him to explore Australia, but was told that his services were not required. He spent over a year in Europe, chiefly in Paris, where he roistered by night and squandered his money. In 1819 he published <span class="italic">A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales</span>. His hopes of marrying John Macarthur's daughter Elizabeth came to nothing. Then Henry Grey Bennet MP declared in his <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Sidmouth</span> (1819) that D'Arcy Wentworth had been sent to Sydney as a convict. Cut to the quick, Wentworth challenged Bennet to a duel and later rebuked Commissioner John Thomas Bigge for repeating the libel in his report on the state of the colony; but his pride had suffered a shock, and he more resolutely identified himself with the emancipists' cause.<br>
<br>Wentworth's book was reissued in revised and enlarged editions in 1820 and 1824. In proposing reforms for New South Wales, he pressed for a nominated legislative council and an assembly elected on a small property franchise; former convicts were to be denied neither membership nor the vote. No taxation should be imposed without parliamentary sanction. There should be trial by jury and free immigration. Yet the book was no tract for democracy. Landed property was &#145;the only standard&#146;, he conceived, &#145;by which the right either of electing, or being elected, can in any country be properly regulated&#146;. The council bore &#145;many resemblances to the House of Lords&#146;: it formed a &#145;just equipoise between the democratic and supreme powers of the state&#146;, and was &#145;necessary not less to repress the licentiousness of the one, than to curb the tyranny of the other&#146;.<br>
<br>After being called to the bar in February 1822, Wentworth entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he competed for the chancellor's gold medal for a poem on Australasia. His entry, placed second, speedily published and dedicated to Macquarie, ended with the hope that Australasia, with flag unfurled, would become &#145;A new Britannia in another world&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoAustraliaandentryintojournalism"></a>Return to Australia and entry into journalism</h2>Wentworth returned to Sydney in 1824, determined &#145;to hold no situation under government&#146;: &#145;As a mere private person I might lead the colony, but as a servant of the Governor I could only conform to his whims.&#146; He had had some influence on the <span class="roman">New South Wales Act</span> of 1823, which instituted a nominated legislative council and permitted trial by jury in civil actions, when demanded by both parties. With Dr Robert Wardell, a lawyer who had edited the London newspaper <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, he planned, in journalism and at the bar, to champion the emancipists and smaller free settlers, and to campaign for self-government, a free press, and trial by jury. Meanwhile, disputes and litigation flourished in the unsettled colony, and Wentworth and Wardell built up a lucrative practice.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1824 the first issue of their newspaper, <span class="italic">The Australian</span>, appeared. They had not sought permission to publish the paper, but Governor Brisbane thought it &#145;expedient to try the experiment of full latitude of freedom of the Press&#146;. Despite Colonial Office objections, approval continued well into the reign of his successor. The exclusives bitterly prophesied a nation of freebooters and pirates, but could do nothing while <span class="italic">The Australian</span> retained Government House favour.<br>
<br>Wentworth pilloried the exclusives as the &#145;yellow snakes of the Colony&#146; and awaited a pretext for attacking autocratic government. In October 1825 he reworded a farewell address to Brisbane, acknowledging his emancipist sympathies, and demanding the &#145;two fundamental principles of the British constitution&#146;: trial by jury and representative government. Then in November 1826&#151;after a soldier, Joseph Sudds, convicted of felony, died after being put in irons and drummed out of his regiment on the orders of Governor Darling&#151;Wentworth seized on the alleged illegality of Darling's act and, with violent invective, demanded his recall.<br>
<br>At a meeting on 26 January 1827, which resulted in a petition calling for an elective assembly of at least 100 members, Wentworth also called for trial by jury and taxation by consent. Convinced that the licentiousness of the press should be restrained by laws, Darling submitted two bills to the legislative council to regulate newspapers and impose a stamp duty. Chief Justice Forbes regarded the licence clauses as being &#145;repugnant to the laws of England&#146; and refused to certify them. Wentworth vilified Darling, who then prosecuted the &#145;vulgar ill-bred fellow&#146; for seditious libel. In his defence, Wentworth overwhelmed the lamentably weak crown prosecutors with torrents of invective and masterly arrangement of his facts. Darling wrote that Wentworth and Wardell kept &#145;the Court and the Bar by their effrontery and talent equally in subjection&#146;, but, largely as a result of Wentworth's insistent demands, the 1828 <span class="roman">New South Wales Act</span> allowed civilian juries in civil cases, on the application of either party and the approval of the Supreme Court. Wentworth prepared articles of &#145;impeachment&#146; against Darling but never followed them up. They did little damage to the governor's reputation at the Colonial Office, but they certainly undermined Wentworth's, so intemperate was their language. None the less, by taking up the fight against autocracy, and by his defence of the emancipists, Wentworth had awakened a political instinct among the people of Sydney and become their hero.<h2>
<a name="Wentworthandselfgovernment"></a>Wentworth and self-government</h2>The swelling tide of immigration lowered the proportion of former convicts in the population, and the exclusive&#150;emancipist issue gradually receded into the background of politics. A larger fight remained&#151;to achieve self-government. Changes in Wentworth's status and activities began to cause disillusion among many who only partially understood his aims. Bequests from his father had added substantially to his landholdings. On 26 October 1829, at St Phillip's Church, he married Sarah (1805&#150;1880), the daughter of an emancipist blacksmith, Francis Cox. Their cottage at Vaucluse was rebuilt into a stately mansion. It was adorned with the trappings of the Old World and became a symbol of the new era that was coming to the rich in New South Wales. With his large legal earnings, Vaucluse, his father's estate at Homebush, and up to fifteen sheep- and cattle-stations, Wentworth increasingly considered himself the prototype of a new nobility, a governing class which would re-create in the Antipodes the way of life of the whig aristocracy of eighteenth-century England. His own way of life became spacious, even to the point of lapses from his marriage vows.<br>
<br>With Darling's successor, Richard Bourke, Wentworth had much in common, and in 1835 his name was on Bourke's list of possible legislative councillors. In London there was growing support for Wentworth's policies: the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> and events in Canada fostered a climate of opinion favourable to constitutional change. At the foundation-day meeting in 1833 another petition for self-government was drafted, which Henry Bulwer presented to the House of Commons. In 1835 the Australian Patriotic Association was formed to agitate for an amended constitution. Wentworth was its vice-president; Bulwer and Charles Buller were employed as its agents in the Commons. With help from William Bland, who was his chief local supporter after Wardell's murder in 1834, Wentworth drafted two alternative bills for the consideration of the British government, and the second, considerably modified, formed the basis of the <span class="roman">New South Wales Act</span> of 1842 which granted a degree of representative government. In an enlarged legislative council two-thirds of the members would be elected, though the electors' property qualification was high enough to exclude two-thirds of the adult male population. The governor ceased to preside over the council and was replaced by an elected speaker.<br>
<br>As Wentworth's whiggism intensified, he increasingly identified political capacity with property and poverty with ignorance. He had given up his legal practice to concentrate on his landed interests. His wealth increased rapidly. The onset of middle age, his experience of the crowd, and the shift in the balance of population caused by assisted immigration all strengthened his conservatism. Lord John Russell's decision to abolish convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840 and to raise the price of crown land drew the exclusives and leading emancipists into united opposition to any change in the conditions allowing them cheap land and cheap labour. When Wentworth supported the idea of importing &#145;coolies&#146; from Asia, he alienated many former supporters and was spurned by newly arrived radicals. In January 1842 <span class="italic">The Australian</span> summed up popular feeling: &#145;Mr Wentworth &hellip; first taught the natives of this colony what liberty was, but he has betrayed them.&#146;<br>
<br>Gipps recommended Wentworth's appointment to the legislative council in April 1839, but was soon at enmity with him. In 1840 Wentworth and some associates bought from seven Maori chieftains, for a pittance, nearly one-third of New Zealand. Aghast, Gipps persuaded the council to block the scheme. It would have made Wentworth the greatest landowner on earth. In his frustration, he swore &#145;eternal vengeance&#146;. Gipps withdrew his nomination to the council. The enmity between the two was to bedevil almost every issue until the governor left in 1846. Wentworth was elected to the legislative council in 1843 to represent Sydney. With his unrivalled knowledge of parliamentary procedure and colonial affairs, he led the council against Gipps. As an orator, he could marshal arguments brilliantly, but he relied little on subtlety or logic. He created a mood, and stormed rather than seduced the mind. Careless and even slovenly in manners and dress (he now wore corduroys with his badly fitting morning-coat), he knew his power and was unconsciously arrogant.<br>
<br>Wentworth led the squatters in their demands for new land regulations and the surrender to the legislative council of imperial control over crown lands. Seeking security of tenure so that they could improve their runs without fear of displacement, they waged unceasing war against Gipps's policies. They won most of their demands in the <span class="roman">Imperial Act</span> of 1846, which gave them security, for varying periods, in the &#145;settled&#146;, &#145;intermediate&#146;, and &#145;unsettled&#146; districts, and they could thwart most would-be purchasers by buying key points on their runs, such as the land around waterholes. Henceforward the graziers could build spacious homesteads and develop the way of life of a landed, governing class. Because pastoral interests were strong in the partly elected council, Wentworth held a firm position there, but he was never again popular as he had been in 1831. In the 1848 election, despite the public outcry over the renewal of transportation, he again headed the Sydney poll, but in 1851&#151;when his unpopularity stood at its height through his insistence on a preponderance of squatter-controlled rural representation over that of Sydney, and his opposition to a wide franchise and to the &#145;spirit of democracy abroad&#146;&#151;he came in third.<br>
<br>Wentworth's fury against unintelligent officialdom or military autocracy sprang from the same source as his distrust of mob rule: a hatred of anything which shackled the human spirit. He was no democrat and no leveller. Individuals must be free, but free to rise. The welfare of the community depended on men of substance. Like his father, he was a monopolist at heart. The realities of the Australian economy, combined with his whiggism, taught him that the landed interest was the one to which, as he told them in 1851, the inhabitants of Sydney &#145;were indebted for all their greatness, all the comforts, all the luxuries, that they possessed&#146;. He told them, too, with no little courage, that he &#145;agreed with that ancient and venerable constitution which treated those who had no property as infants, or idiots, unfit to have any voice in the management of the State&#146;. The way out of infancy, or idiocy, was through education.<br>
<br>Wentworth played a leading part with Robert Lowe (Viscount Sherbrooke) in establishing in 1848&#150;9 the first real system of state primary education in New South Wales. The colony was on the brink of gaining responsible government, which, he argued, would be workable only through national education. He went on in 1849&#150;50 to lead the movement that resulted in the founding of the first colonial university in the British empire, the University of Sydney. In his view, tertiary education should be open to all, regardless of religious denomination, and would serve two ends: &#145;to enlighten the mind, to refine the understanding, to elevate the soul of our fellow men&#146;; and to train men to fill &#145;the high offices of state&#146;. Wentworth helped to endow the university and was a member of its first senate.<br>
<br>When leading the opposition to Gipps in the legislative council, Wentworth had wanted to make ministers responsible to the elected representatives of the people, but he lost enthusiasm for this reform after Gipps's successor, Sir Charles FitzRoy, eased the friction between executive and legislature. Wentworth then turned to demands that the colony should control crown lands, official appointments, colonial revenue, and all local affairs. These demands, expressed in the remonstrances of 1850 and 1851, remained urgent when gold was discovered and the pastoral ascendancy seemed likely to be seriously threatened by &#145;pure democracy&#146;. Although the Colonial Office finally agreed in 1852 that New South Wales should have responsible government, the council's select committee which drafted the constitution in 1853 provided only a limited form of individual responsibility for some members of the executive. With Wentworth as chairman, it recommended a lower house of fifty members elected on a &pound;10 property franchise, and a nominated upper house consisting of members with hereditary titles. The rural bias of the proposed lower house and the idea of a peerage were vociferously opposed in Sydney, and despite Wentworth's vigorous defence, the bill, as eventually passed, provided for a nominated legislative council (shorn of the hereditary principle) and an elected legislative assembly. With Edward Deas Thomson, Wentworth sailed for England in 1854, and in July 1855 had the satisfaction of seeing the new constitution made law. The General Association for the Australian Colonies&#151;which he formed in London in 1857 to induce the Colonial Office to inaugurate a federal parliament for Australia&#151;died an early death.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>His life's work triumphantly achieved, Wentworth spent his remaining years in England, except for a brief return to Sydney in 1861&#150;2, when he was prevailed upon to accept the presidency of the council. He had consolidated his fame more by staying away and being remembered for his great achievements than if he had returned, been drawn into the political fray, and tried to halt the democratic tide. In England he became a member of the Conservative Club and lived at Merly House, near Wimborne, Dorset. There he died on 20 March 1872, survived by his wife, five of their seven daughters, and two of their three sons. His estate was sworn for probate at &pound;96,000 in Sydney and &pound;70,000 in London. As he had wished, his body was taken to Sydney and, following a state funeral on 6 May 1873, was laid to rest in a vault on his estate at Vaucluse.<br>
<br>Wentworth was an heir to the whig tradition and a child of the Romantic movement. The chief intellectual influence upon him was Edmund Burke. Emotionally, however, he was Byronic. The subjection of his proud and romantic nature to the classical restraints of law and politics, though sometimes imperfectly achieved, increased rather than diminished his achievement. In his determination to secure for his own country those free institutions which in eighteenth-century England bore an aristocratic form, he may have regretted that their very freedom would allow them to become democratic, but their freedom meant more to him than their form. His love of Australia was, he confessed, the &#145;master passion&#146; of his life. It is his chief claim to greatness that he played a significant part in securing in Australia, in one lifetime, that which he and other contemporaries revered as the fundamental liberties of the British constitution.<br>
