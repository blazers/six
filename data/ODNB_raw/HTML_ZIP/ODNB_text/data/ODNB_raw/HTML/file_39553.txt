<span class="headword">Hughes,  Marian Rebecca</span>  (1817&#150;1912), <span class="occ">Anglican nun</span>, was born on 14 January 1817 at Shenington, Gloucestershire, the youngest of the three children of the Revd Robert Edward Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1846), rector of Shenington, and his wife, Martha Pyner (1786&#150;<i>c</i>.1852). She had a brother, Robert, and a sister, Fanny.<br>
<br>Marian Hughes is distinguished as being the first woman to take religious vows in the Church of England since the Reformation. The idea of reintroducing Sisters of Mercy within the Church of England had first been suggested by E. B. Pusey in 1839 but it was not until 1845 that the sisterhood at 17 Park Village West began its life. Meanwhile, after reading an essay by Newman, Marian Hughes had resolved to become a Sister of Mercy. She became acquainted with the Revd Charles Seager (1808&#150;1878), a friend of Pusey and of her cousin the Revd Thomas Chamberlain, vicar of St Thomas's, Oxford, and from them she learned that there were no Anglican sisterhoods.<br>
<br>Despite this, Marian Hughes took the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience privately before Pusey at Seager's home early in the morning of Trinity Sunday (6 June) 1841. She then went to St Mary's Church and received holy communion from Newman. Kneeling beside her was Pusey's daughter, Lucy, who was receiving her first holy communion. That night Marian Hughes wrote: &#145;This day Trinity Sunday 1841, was I enrolled one of Christ's Virgins, espoused to Him and made His handmaid. &hellip; Written by me in the 24th year of my life at 12 o'clock at night on my knees&#146;  (Hughes, MS diary). Family ties prevented Marian from forming a sisterhood or from joining Park Village but she played an important advisory role in these formative years. Thus a few months after making her vows she accompanied Seager and his wife to Normandy, where she visited several religious orders and studied their rules and constitutions. On returning home she helped Pusey draw up the Park Village rule and also advised Lydia Sellon (1821&#150;1876), who was planning her sisterhood at Devonport.<br>
<br>After Robert Hughes's death in 1846 Marian's brother became rector of Shenington and Marian stayed there to keep house. Following his marriage in 1849 she and her mother moved to Oxford and lived in Chamberlain's parish, where there was much work to be done among the poor. On 10 December 1849 Bishop Samuel Wilberforce formally sanctioned the foundation of a sisterhood, but it was not until after her move to a house in St John's Street in 1851 and her mother's death shortly afterwards that it assumed the character of a religious community. The Society of the Holy and Undivided Trinity (not to be confused with Lydia Sellon's Society of the Most Holy Trinity) had as its object service of the poor, sick, and needy. Within a few years it ran a number of schools and an orphanage, besides carrying out parish work in the Jericho district of Oxford; in 1854 the sisterhood displayed great heroism in the cholera epidemic. The rule and habit, formulated by Mother Marian, were based on those of the French Ursulines, and the magnificent new convent erected in 1866&#150;8 along the Woodstock Road (later St Antony's College) was known for its austerity.<br>
<br>Mother Marian Hughes died on 7 May 1912 at the convent, having remained mother superior until her death. She was buried on 9 May in St Sepulchre's cemetery, Walton Street, Oxford, following a requiem in the convent chapel. A large number of clergy and lay people joined in the funeral procession, which was headed by girls from the orphanage carrying flowers, with twenty-four sisters following the bier.<br>
<br>Mother Marian was described in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as: &#145;a woman of great force of character, great capacity for organisation and government, and remarkable energy&#146;. The church newspaper <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> paid similar tribute to her strength of character, and to her &#145;deep devotion of life&#146;, adding that &#145;she died as she had lived&#151;in prayer&#146;. Canon Henry Scott Holland remarked that: &#145;She never let her wonderful past imprison her &hellip; and was always a most delightful companion and friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span>). Her later years had been spent within the convent where she loved to reminisce about Pusey, Newman, and Keble; but while the past may not have imprisoned her, deafness certainly did. Hindsight might question the wisdom of retaining the office of mother superior all those years, but her real achievement lay in that vast act of faith made on Trinity Sunday 1841 when she stood completely alone in the Church of England under the vows she had made&#151;and which she kept for seventy-one years.<br>
