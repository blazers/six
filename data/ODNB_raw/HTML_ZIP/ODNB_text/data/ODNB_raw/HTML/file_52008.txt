<span class="headword">Browne,  Maurice</span>  (1555/6&#150;1583), <span class="occ">adventurer and courtier</span>, was the fourth son of John Browne, merchant, of London, and his third wife, Christian, daughter of William Carkett of London. He was thirteen at the time of the visitation of London in 1568. John Browne died in September 1570, leaving Maurice's education to the care of his executors: Maurice had matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1569. His father had made a contract securing a little London property in Hart Street for him, probably from Maurice's mother's family. In 1576 Sir Thomas Smith referred to Maurice Browne as his servant and kinsman, and by 1580 he was apparently one of Sir Francis Walsingham's assistants. He was also the busy London agent for the Thynne family of Longleat, dealing with all kinds of tasks for them, domestic and political&#151;he provided a lively commentary on the implications of court fortunes for the Thynne&#150;Knyvet alliance. He negotiated with Walsingham and other court patrons for help against Thynne's enemies, especially Lord Stafford; and for John Thynne's appointment to Wiltshire offices. He informed Thynne in April 1580 that his ally Henry Knyvet would not gain the office of <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Wiltshire, because the earl of Leicester supported the earl of Pembroke for it. In May 1583 Browne described the rise to royal favour of Walter Ralegh, noting Ralegh's luxurious surroundings and sumptuous apparel. Since Thynne was at loggerheads with Ralegh's brother Carew, Browne thought Thynne should create a more dashing image when coming to court by investing in new clothes. Browne's advice was to cultivate Leicester, but also to approach a different patron, Sir Christopher Hatton. Browne also reported on family events in London such as the planned marriage of Thynne's widowed father-in-law, Sir Rowland Hayward, to the young daughter of Thomas (Customer) Smith.<br>
<br>In 1581 Browne went to Terceira in the Azores, probably sent by Walsingham as an agent for England's support of Don Antonio's claim to the Portuguese crown, against Spain. Browne returned about September 1581, with a Father John of the Holy Spirit, who was to serve as a &#145;living letter&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1581&#150;2</i>, nos. 366&#150;7, 439), to report on the state of the island and its readiness for Don Antonio's defence.<br>
<br>Browne became interested in maps and cosmography, and in August 1582 Sir Humphrey Gilbert convinced him of the great riches expected in Gilbert's proposed colony in North America. Walsingham was a supporter of Gilbert's project, and encouraged Browne to go, and on his return to tell the queen of the colony's establishment, upon which news she had promised to send more shipping and men. During the long delays of late 1582 and early 1583 Browne spent much time with Gilbert. The little expedition departed in June 1583. Browne went as captain of the 40 ton <i>Swallow</i>, despite his lack of marine expertise; and he could not prevent the men from plundering a passing fishing ship. After Gilbert formally claimed possession of Newfoundland for England, Browne was appointed captain of the 120 ton <i>Delight</i> for the continuation of the voyage, leaving St John's on 20 August 1583. Allegedly, Gilbert insisted that the three ships sail a course towards Sable Island. On 28 August the men on the <i>Delight</i> were heard carousing with trumpets, drums, and fifes all night, but the crew did not keep proper watch as the wind rose, and the ship grounded next morning, with the loss of the supplies, and almost a hundred men. According to Edward Hayes's account, Browne nobly refused calls to save himself in the small boat in which sixteen men survived, instead going up to the highest deck to await imminent death. Browne had been an assiduous and apparently charming courtier, on the fringe of the Walsingham&#150;Gilbert&#150;Hakluyt connection, and he impressed people: Walsingham and Gilbert gave him responsibilities, and Edward Hayes lamented the loss of a virtuous, honest, and discreet gentleman. However, enthusiasm could not compensate for inexperience (or Gilbert's misjudgements), and Browne could not adequately discipline the rough sailors. On 9 September Gilbert drowned too. This ambitious venture to colonize North America failed. Browne's untimely death on 29 August 1583 cut short his promising career and ended his lively reporting on the Elizabethan court.<br>
