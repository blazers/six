<span class="headword">Lopez <span class="st"> [Lopes]</span>,  Roderigo <span class="st"> [Ruy, Roger]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1517&#150;1594), <span class="occ">physician and alleged conspirator</span>, was born in Portugal, where his father, Ant&oacute;nio Lopes, was physician to Jo&atilde;o III. A New Christian, or son of a Jew baptized by force in 1497, he studied at the University of Coimbra, graduating BA on 7 February 1540 as Ruy Lopes, MA on 4 December 1541, and going on to enrol for the medical course on 23 December 1541. The university's degree registers for the period from 1537 to 1550 have not survived, but it is likely that he received his degree in medicine in 1544. Lopez settled in London in 1559, soon after Elizabeth I's accession. He was admitted as a fellow of the College of Physicians (the date is not recorded) and was the first appointee as physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital following its refoundation in 1547. He received &pound;2 a year with a house and garden nearby in Little Britain. One of his colleagues at the hospital, William Clowes, noted in his work on gunshot wounds (1591) that Lopez showed himself to be both careful and very skilful, not only in his counsel in dieting, purging and bleeding, but also for the direction of Arceus's apozema. About 1563 he married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1550), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40770/', "Dunstan Anes")</script>, citizen and grocer of London. She was English born of Portuguese Jewish parents. They conformed to the established church but secretly adhered to Judaism. Their eldest daughter, Ellyn or Elinor, was baptized on 9 January 1564 at St Bartholomew-the-Less, as were other children: Ambrose on 6 May 1565, Douglas on 13 May 1573, William on 24 October 1577, and Ann on 1 March 1579. Their son Anthony was sent to Winchester College. In the 1571 census of aliens in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn, Lopez is described as &#145;Doctor Lopus, Portingale, howsholder, denizen came into this realm about xij yeares past to get his lyvinge by physycke; and Lewis Lopez, his brother, is a soiourner in his howse and a joyner&#146;  (Huguenot Society). Another brother, Diego Lopes Aleman, was a merchant in Antwerp and Venice.<br>
<br>Lopez became physician to the earl of Leicester and after the death of Giulio Borgarucci he was appointed physician to the queen and her household in 1581. As such he received a life pension of &pound;50 a year. In June 1584, by way of reward, he was granted a monopoly of the importation of sumach and aniseed for ten years. This was renewed again in January 1593. In 1588 he was granted land and tithes in Worcestershire belonging to the bishop of Worcester. Lopez lived at one time in Wood Street and later in Mountjoy's Inn, Fenchurch Street.<br>
<br>In 1580 King Henrique of Portugal died and Philip II of Spain invaded and seized the country. The other claimant to the Portuguese throne, Dom Ant&oacute;nio, prior of Crato, took refuge in France and then in England with his followers. Lopez, who was among his keen supporters, helped to persuade the queen to recognize him as king of Portugal. However, Dom Ant&oacute;nio's cause did not prosper and after the failure of his counter armada attack on Lisbon, in 1589, his followers gradually defected and made their peace with Philip.<br>
<br>In 1584 <span class="italic">Leicester's Commonwealth</span>, an anonymous Roman Catholic tract attacking the earl of Leicester, mentioned Lopez among his instruments: &#145;Iulio the Italian and Lopes the Iewe, for Poysoning &amp; for the arte of destroying children in women's bellies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leicester's Commonwealth</span>, 116). This was the first suggestion made that Lopez was a poisoner. A second such suggestion was made in 1586 by Ant&oacute;nio da Veiga, one of Dom Ant&oacute;nio's turncoat followers. In a letter to Don Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador to France, he claimed that in 1572 Don Gerau de Espes, the Spanish ambassador in London, had persuaded Lopez to sabotage Bartolomeo Bayon's voyage to the Spanish Indies by giving him a purge, which, however, Lopez did not do. Veiga claimed that he could persuade Lopez to poison Dom Ant&oacute;nio. The Spaniards did nothing about it.<br>
<br>In 1590 Lopez himself approached Mendoza, through the intermediacy of Manuel de Andrada, who was a double agent, possibly on the initiative of the secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham, who had used Hector Nunes in 1586 to open negotiations with Spain. Lopez, who was Walsingham's physician, was an obvious alternative intermediary. Mendoza sent Andrada on to Spain, where he was interviewed by the Portuguese secretary of state, Dom Cristov&atilde;o de Moura. Andrada proposed two things: first the opening of peace negotiations through Lopez, and second the immobilization of Dom Ant&oacute;nio by getting the English to agree either to his house arrest or else to his expulsion. The Spaniards were also interested in persuading Dom Ant&oacute;nio's son Manuel to defect. The correspondence between Dom Cristov&atilde;o de Moura and Philip II in the Spanish state papers makes it quite clear that these were then their sole aims in opening negotiations with Lopez. They gave Andrada a jewelled ring worth &pound;100 as a gift for Lopez's daughter. Walsingham died in 1591 and Lopez continued his correspondence with the Spanish officials without the knowledge or authority of the English government.<br>
<br>Lopez also incurred the enmity of his former patient, the earl of Essex. In a conversation with Dom Ant&oacute;nio and with Philip II's former secretary, Ant&oacute;nio Perez, who lived at Essex House, Lopez told them of what diseases he had treated Essex, &#145;which did disparage his honour&#146;  (Goodman, 1.152&#150;3). Perez reported this back to Essex, who was understandably furious.<br>
<br>After Walsingham's death in 1591 Essex took the latter's principal cryptologist, Thomas Phelipes of the Customs House, into his service and he discovered a secret correspondence between Estev&atilde;o Ferreira da Gama, one of Dom Ant&oacute;nio's erstwhile supporters, and the count of Fuentes, in the Spanish Netherlands. This was followed by the arrest of Lopez's courier, Gomez d'Avila, a Portuguese New Christian living in London, and of one Manuel Luis Tinoco, who was carrying letters from Spanish officials in the Netherlands to Ferreira da Gama. When they were interrogated they implicated Lopez. On 28 January 1594 Essex wrote to Anthony Bacon,<blockquote>I have discovered a most dangerous and desperate treason. The point of conspiracy was Her Ma<sup>ties</sup> death. The executioner should have been Dr Lopus. The manner by poison. This I have so followed that I will make it appeare as cleere as the noone day. (LPL, MS 653 fol. 312, vol. 7, no. 17)</blockquote>Once Essex had committed his reputation to this thesis Lopez's fate was sealed. Matters were also made worse by a letter which Manuel Andrada had sent to Lord Burleigh in 1591, in which he wrote, &#145;The King of Spain had gotten three Portuguese to kill her Majesty and three more to kill the King of France&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1591&#150;2</i>). Once a clandestine correspondence with Spain had been discovered this naturally left William Waad and Sir Robert Cecil keen to unmask Andrada's three unnamed Portuguese assassins. Tinoco was tortured and Ferreira da Gama threatened with torture until their confessions confirmed Essex's preconceptions. Ferreira da Gama was asked if Lopez would have been willing to poison the queen and confirmed that he would have been. Philip's main concern was to neutralize Dom Ant&oacute;nio and to eliminate Ant&oacute;nio Perez. Lopez had acted stupidly and dishonestly. Once his intrigues came to light, and these included passing information about the English court to Spain and a cryptic letter concerning his donation to a secret synagogue in Antwerp, the privy council, including William Waad and Robert Cecil, were ready to believe the worst. Lopez's claim that the sole purpose of his intrigue was &#145;to deceive the Spaniard and wipe him of his money&#146;  (Camden, 484) was not believed. Lopez, Manuel Luis Tinoco, and Estev&atilde;o Ferreira da Gama were tried at Guildhall. The attorney-general, Sir Edward Coke, made great play with Lopez's secret Judaism. All three were convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 7 June 1594. The government published an official account of the plot, stressing the criminal conduct of Philip of Spain in trying to murder the queen of England, whereas she never had and never would attempt to murder him.<br>
<br>Many people, influenced by the flow of polemics after the event, were shocked at Lopez's alleged venality and ingratitude to the queen, who had been his benefactress. Christopher Marlowe's play <span class="italic">The Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta</span> with its villainous Jewish character, Barabbas, was revived. William Shakespeare responded by writing and staging <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> with its murderous Jewish character, Shylock, who hates all Christians. Their audiences would have been well aware of the story of Lopez's alleged plot.<br>
<br>Some ten years later Count Gondomar wrote to Philip III about the affair, alleging that Lopez and Ferreira da Gama had been innocent and unjustly convicted. He wrote,<blockquote>the King our master had never conceived nor approved such measures &hellip; the Count of Fuentes neither received nor gave such an order, moreover it is understood that Dr Lopez never passed through his thoughts, because he was a friend of the Queen and a bad Christian. (Documentos ineditos, 196&#150;8)</blockquote>Sarah Lopez petitioned the queen to be allowed her late husband's estate. The queen kept King Philip's ring and most generously gave her back the rest, which was little enough.<br>
