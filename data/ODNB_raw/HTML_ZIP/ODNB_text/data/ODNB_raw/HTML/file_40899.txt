</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacLean,  Sorley</span> <span class="st"> [Somhairle MacGill-Eain]</span>  (1911&#150;1996), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 26 October 1911 at Oscaig, Raasay, Inverness-shire, the second of the seven children of Malcolm MacLean (1880&#150;1951), a tailor, and his wife, Christina (1886&#150;1974), daughter of Sorley Nicolson of Braes, Skye, and his wife, Isobel.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>MacLean received his early education at Raasay primary school (1918&#150;24) and then at Portree High School, on Skye (1924&#150;9), where he had a very good grounding in such subjects as Latin (he became a great lover of Virgil) and French (including Corneille, Racine, Villon, and Verlaine). Much seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poetry in Gaelic was read, and he also took a great interest in English and history.<br>
<br>However, as with many poets and other writers it was not what he was taught in school that influenced MacLean's work (though of course it was important); he was also greatly influenced by the historical evidence of the clearances, and communicated especially by oral tradition. He had been born into a family of traditional singers and pipers. The first great artistic impression on MacLean was made by his father's mother, who sang some of the very greatest of Gaelic songs. His father, too, had a fine voice and was very interested in Gaelic poetry. Other relatives were also good singers and his brother John was a player of pibroch. Thus the poet grew up in an environment that was rich with Gaelic culture of all kinds, particularly song. This had an immense influence. Indeed so great an impression did these songs have on MacLean that he later wrote: &#145;Even to this day, I sometimes think that if I had been a singer I would have written no verse, but perhaps if I had been a singer I would have tried to create original melodies&#146;  (MacLean, 9). These great songs of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had for him, above all, intense passion&#151;of love and grief and hate and other emotions&#151;and they were a powerful influence.<br>
<br>MacLean was brought up in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland which, according to him, believed that &#145;not only were the secular arts dangerous vanities but also that the great bulk of humanity, and the great bulk of Free Presbyterians as well, were to spend an eternity of physical and mental torture&#146;  (MacLean, 10). The small number of the elect who could be saved made MacLean anti-&eacute;litist. In a letter to Douglas Young written in 1941 he stated:<blockquote>Perhaps my obsession with the &#145;cause&#146; of the unhappy, the unsuccessful, the oppressed comes ultimately from this. I preferred the multitude of my friends who [were] certain to be &#145;lost&#146; to those few who were to be saved. In fact there was no-one of my own family who on form showed any potentiality for salvation. I disliked many of the obvious &#145;elect&#146; not because of their good fortune, but because most of them were unlovable people and I regarded their preoccupation with salvation much as I regard the careerist at present. (Whyte, 141)</blockquote>Even so MacLean was influenced constructively by his Free Presbyterian background, admitting that he was &#145;very familiar with Seceder metaphysics and imagery and vocabulary&#146;  (ibid., 3). The theme of choice, with free will pitted against constricting circumstances, which generates much of the creative tension in MacLean's work, can perhaps be seen as a reflex of the religious debate about election. He was also ready to acknowledge his debt to the great Gaelic preachers within the Free Presbyterian tradition, like the Revd Ewen MacQueen, whose powerful rhetoric moved him. He also retained warm friendships with clergymen of different churches throughout his life. Although he is sometimes regarded as antipathetic to the church in the highlands his views need to be read carefully. His well-known poem &#145;Ban-ghaidheal&#146; (&#145;Highland woman&#146;), in which he condemns Christ and his church for failing to address the oppression of highland women, weighed down by burdens in their creels and the demands of the rent, should not be taken as a blanket dismissal of the whole church in the highlands. It is a comment on the church's general lack of social conscience. MacLean's indictment foreshadows the critique at the heart of &#145;liberation theology&#146; in Latin America, Africa, and the Third World in the second half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>From sixteen or so MacLean had been writing some verse in English and in Gaelic. Moreover from the age of twelve he had been &#145;an idealist democratic revolutionary&#146;  (MacLean, 9), fancying his future as a politician who would help to change the world. In his later teens &#145;a dichotomy&#146; took him: &#145;my pure aesthetic idols of old Gaelic songs, and my humano-aesthetic idols of Blake and Shelley&#146;  (ibid., 10). His English verse became more influenced by Donne, Eliot, and Pound. Though he came from a thoroughly Gaelic environment it seemed economically sensible to study English. The great Herbert Grierson, who was doing so much to make Donne influential, was professor at Edinburgh University when MacLean began his studies there aged seventeen.<br>
<br>In 1933 MacLean met James B. Caird, who introduced him to the poetry of Christopher Murray Grieve 
    (known as Hugh MacDiarmid, 1892&#150;1978)
  . So overwhelmed was he by that poet's early lyrics that it almost destroyed his chance of writing poetry himself. MacDiarmid's work seemed to him to be &#145;the unattainable summit of the lyric, and the lyric is the summit of all poetry&#146;  (MacLean, 11). In it he found a combination of timeless and modern sensibility. MacDiarmid's <span class="italic">A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</span> also suggested to him the idea of a song medley with lyric peaks, an idea that would bear fruit later in his long poem <span class="italic">An Cuilithionn</span> (<span class="italic">The Cuillin</span>, 1939). Caird recalls discussions with MacLean that ranged over Greek, Latin, French, English, and Scottish poetry; he describes MacLean as passionate and eloquent when his interest was aroused. They were both devoted to MacDiarmid and to Yeats. At this time MacLean was becoming discontented with his own poems in English, feeling that they did not express his authentic self, and in 1932 he wrote a Gaelic poem, &#145;The Heron&#146;, which shows quite clearly that a new poetic power had entered Gaelic literature. This is the first work in his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1989) and shows that he himself felt that it was here that he found his voice. It is a very modern poem, troubled in its thought but decisive in the expression of that thought.<br>
<br>After four years at Edinburgh University, where he achieved a first-class honours degree in English, MacLean undertook a year of teacher training at Moray House College of Education, in Edinburgh. By 1934 he had met MacDiarmid, and the two men remained in close contact thereafter. Together with George Campbell Hay (1915&#150;1984), MacLean and MacDiarmid formed part of a literary circle whose presiding genius was Douglas Young (1913&#150;1973), himself a poet and a lecturer in Latin and Greek at several Scottish universities before his emigration to Canada and, later, the USA. Young's passionate commitment to Scottish nationalism and to a modern renaissance of Scottish verse encouraged all within the group: &#145;He cemented the relationships between Hugh MacDiarmid and Sorley MacLean&#146;  (Byrne, 3).<br>
<br>MacLean's professional life was spent as a teacher, beginning at Portree High School, on Skye, in 1934 and ending at Plockton High School, Ross-shire, where he was headmaster until his retirement, in 1972. He could not be a &#145;professional poet&#146; and wrote only when intensely moved to do so. His life in education, first as teacher, then principal teacher of English, and finally headmaster, prevented him, as he himself would say, from writing poetry for long periods.<h2>
<a name="DindoEimhiragusdineileworkofthe1930s"></a>D&agrave;in do Eimhir agus d&agrave;in eile: work of the 1930s</h2>Though not published until 1943 the poems in <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do Eimhir agus d&agrave;in eile</span> (&#145;Poems to Eimhir and Other Poems&#146;) were mostly written in the thirties. They are for the most part love poems set against the background of the Spanish Civil War. The Eimhir of the title is the name of the wife of the Ulster hero, C&uacute; Chulainn, and it covers the identity of four young ladies who attracted MacLean's attention to varying degrees and who had a catalytic role in the creation of the poems. MacLean wrote:<blockquote>My mother's long illness in 1936, its recurrence in 1938, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the progressive decline of my father's business in the Thirties &hellip; made these years for me years of difficult choice and the tension of these years confirmed self-expression in poetry not in action. (MacLean, 12)</blockquote>Thus MacLean did not go to the Spanish Civil War, because he was needed to support his family. However, what comes across in <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do Eimhir</span> is a conflict between private love and public duty: it seems that he did not go because of a passionate and, in historical terms, selfish love affair. In effect what we have here is the key book of Gaelic twentieth-century poetry in the same way as <span class="italic">A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</span> and Eliot's <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span> are key texts in Scots and English, respectively. Many of the poems have a lovely musical quality, as one would expect from a poet who loved the great Gaelic songs of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but this is at the same time infused with an urgent political content. It was unusual to find, in Gaelic, poetry that dealt so urgently with contemporary issues that lay outside the highlands, an issue that was in fact at the centre of history. MacLean had himself been dismissive of nineteenth-century Gaelic poetry: &#145;in the main, [it] is an expression of a somewhat romantic nostalgia for a hopelessly gone past rather than a realist examination of the change&#146;  (MacLean, 45). It had for the most part not faced the clearances directly. His own poetry in <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do Eimhir</span> certainly has an urgent political tone.<br>
<br>However, it is MacLean's love poetry that makes the greatest impact. Behind it is the influence of William Ross, the great eighteenth-century Gaelic love poet, and almost certainly of Yeats. The influence of Donne can perhaps be found in &#145;The Selling of a Soul&#146;. In these poems there are references to the doomed miner of Spain fighting &#145;the brute and brigand at the head of Europe&#146;. Sometimes, as in &#145;The Choice&#146;, the poet shows contempt for himself that he did not fight in Spain. There are references to Francis Cornford, Julian Bell, and Federico Garcia Lorca.<br>
<br>From a Marxist standpoint there are attacks in the love poems on the bourgeoisie and on religion. A whole complex of ideas is brought together in a longish work, &#145;Prayer&#146;, which describes the agony of seeing Spain &#145;lost&#146; while MacLean himself did nothing. Should he ask that his &#145;heart be purified&#146; from the &#145;weakness&#146; of his &#145;pure-white love&#146; so that he could become as &#145;brave as Dmitrov or Connolly&#146;? He calls his own life &#145;the death-like life&#146; because he preferred &#145;a woman to crescent History&#146;. He recognizes that his prayer is not sincere and that his spirit is not &#145;one-fold&#146;. There are poems with metaphysical imagery and ones of surrealism. Such poetry was quite new in Gaelic, but these works were to be found alongside lovely lyrical poems like &#145;Under Sail&#146;. All the love poems, however, resonate from a common centre and with the same intensity and personal rhythm. There is a mixture of the traditional and the new, as this Marxist highlander is remade by an existential experience.<h2>
<a name="AnCuilithionnTheCuillin"></a>An Cuilithionn (The Cuillin)</h2>
<span class="italic">An Cuilithionn</span> is the long poem that MacLean started in 1939. The idea for it had probably been generated by a reading of MacDiarmid's <span class="italic">A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</span>. He had left Portree High School in 1937 and gone to teach in Mull, and that island, with its desolation, had made him aware of the highland clearances. He was also obsessed with the approaching war and the idea that Nazism and fascism would conquer Europe. The poem stopped in late May or June 1939 and was not resumed until late October or November of that year; it was concluded in December.<br>
<br>The &#145;Cuilithionn&#146; are the Cuillin mountains of Skye, which in the poem become a symbol for a human ideal. The poem has much in it about the highland clearances, which are combined with the sufferings of Spain. In the poem MacLean was able to see, by means of Marxist theory, the clearances as part of a European capitalist aggrandizement. Other highland poets had been more na&iuml;ve and not equipped with that analysis. In this long poem MacLean attacks the bourgeoisie, and Scotland itself, among many other nations including England, France, and of course Germany. They are all part of the morass at the foot of the Cuillins&#151;the quagmire that has swallowed so many of the poor and oppressed. This morass even swallowed the French Revolution, and swallowed the heroism of Spain. The poet has no hope of ever ascending &#145;to the high hunting ground of the moorland&#146;. He says that there is so much of the morass in his spirit that his &#145;courage has taken the grey hue&#146;. It may be that this hatred of the self came about because he did not fight in the Spanish Civil War.<br>
<br>Under the personification of Clio, the muse of history, there is a long catalogue of the sufferings of populations, beginning in Skye and spreading outwards to Ireland, England, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Germany, India, and China. However, as well as mention of these sufferings there is mention of heroes who fought for freedom&#151;Connolly and Pearse, Wat Tyler and John Ball, Spartacus, Nehru and Gandhi, among others&#151;as well as writers such as Rousseau, Voltaire, and Cobbett.<br>
<br>Two particular men stand out in the catalogue of the heroic. One is John MacLean, a man of his own clan of whom he felt very proud and to whom he dedicated a poem. John MacLean was a schoolmaster and member of the Social Democratic Federation. He believed passionately in workers' education. He was anti-militarist and was imprisoned four times between 1911 and 1921. He died at the age of forty-four. The other outstanding figure was Dmitrov, a Bulgarian communist who was arrested in 1933 on a trumped-up charge of having set fire to the Reichstag. He conducted his own defence, making a fool of Goering, his prosecutor.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">An Cuilithionn</span> is not as fine a poem as <span class="italic">A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</span>. There is not enough variation of tone nor are there any of the comic passages and philosophic bravura with which MacDiarmid enlivened his poem. MacLean's best poetry has always been passionately lyrical, for he does not have the same interest in ideas as MacDiarmid. What we get from <span class="italic">An Cuilithionn</span> is the passionate cry of a sensitive mind against deeply felt oppression.<br>
<br>MacDiarmid and MacLean continued to encourage one another, MacLean by providing translations of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Gaelic verse for MacDiarmid's <span class="italic">Golden Treasury of Scottish Verse</span> (1940) and MacDiarmid by saluting and affirming MacLean's verse when his first volume, <span class="italic">Seventeen Poems for Sixpence</span>, produced in collaboration with the poet Robert Garioch, who hand-printed it, was published in 1940. MacDiarmid found MacLean's support invaluable in his ongoing crusade against parochialism and Anglocentrism.<h2>
<a name="Warservicemarriageandfurtherpoems19401946"></a>War service, marriage, and further poems, 1940&#150;1946</h2>MacLean volunteered for the army in September 1939 but, having learned that he would lose his teaching salary, he waited for conscription, which came in September 1940, when he was enlisted into the signal corps. In the meantime he taught evacuees at Hawick between October 1939 and June 1940. His army training took place at Catterick Camp, Yorkshire, and from there he corresponded with Young on the preparation of <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do Eimhir</span> for publication. Young typed and edited the drafts, checking every difficult point with MacLean. In December 1941 MacLean was sent to Egypt on active service. He wrote to MacDiarmid:<blockquote>My fear and hatred of the Nazis [is] even more than my hatred of the English Empire &hellip; I support the British Empire because it is the weakest and therefore not as great a threat to Europe and the rest of the world as a German victory. (Ross and Hendry, 27)</blockquote>He served in north Africa and was wounded three times. The last time was in 1942, during the battle of El Alamein. He was seriously injured when a land mine exploded near him, shattering many of the bones in his feet and heels. The following nine months he spent in military hospitals, until his discharge from Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, in August 1943. For many years parts of <span class="italic">An Cuilithionn</span> were published here and there in magazines and journals. When MacLean was invalided out of the army he says that there was some talk of publishing it in full, but production was delayed until &#145;the behaviour of the Russian government to the Polish insurrection in 1944 made me politically as well as aesthetically disgusted with most of it&#146;  (S. MacLean, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1989, 63).<br>
<br>It seems that MacLean lost his faith in the USSR as the political saviour of the working classes, and in 1946 he was writing to MacDiarmid that he was &#145;utterly at sea in politics these days, having for the past year and a half, come to the conclusion that the Communist Party is no use for me&#146; and that he had gone back to &#145;social democracy and swithering between Labour and S.N.P&#146;  (Ross and Hendry, 28).<br>
<br>In 1944 he met (Catherine) Renee Stewart Cameron (<i>b</i>. 1920), whom he married on 24 July 1946. They had three daughters: Ishbel, Catriona, and Mary.<br>
<br>Six poems from the war period are to be found in MacLean's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>. &#145;Going Westwards&#146; shows his general attitude to the war and the enemy. However, he says there is no avoidance of the struggle and he reflects in the last verse on his own heroic ancestors. &#145;Heroes&#146; is an interesting poem in which he describes an Englishman who fought with him in Egypt. Unlike the handsome highland chiefs commemorated in Gaelic poetry this is:<blockquote>
<div>a poor little chap with chubby cheeks<br>
</div>
<div>and knees grinding each other,<br>
</div>
<div>pimply unattractive face.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Nevertheless this is &#145;a lion against the breast of battle&#146;. Though he was killed while firing into the German tanks he did not receive any medals. One of the most powerful of the war poems is &#145;Death Valley&#146;, where the poet finds a dead soldier:<blockquote>
<div>a boy with his forelock down about his cheek<br>
</div>
<div>and his face slate-grey.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>As he observes the &#145;flies about grey corpses&#146; he wonders about the &#145;right and joy&#146; that this German got from his <i>F&uuml;hrer</i> and whether the boy had in his lifetime abused the Jews or communists. In &#145;Autumn Day&#146; there is an interesting reference to the Free Presbyterian doctrine of the elect. Six men are killed beside MacLean quite suddenly. He concludes:<blockquote>
<div>One Election took them<br>
</div>
<div>and did not take me,<br>
</div>
<div>without asking us<br>
</div>
<div>which was better or worse.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Of MacLean's other poems one might single out the lovely &#145;The Woods of Raasay&#146;, in some ways one of his most traditional pieces, with its many adjectives, such as one finds for instance in the great eighteenth-century poem &#145;Ben Dorain&#146;, by Duncan Ban Macintyre. However, though &#145;The Woods of Raasay&#146; has a lovely freshness it is also shot through with sexual imagery, disturbances, and anguished reflections on love. Another poem, &#145;Hallaig&#146;, about one of the cleared townships in Raasay, may be his best single poem. The tone is quiet and eerie, elegiac and gentle. He sees the dead people in the shape of a wood going up beside the stream. He writes of the young girls going to church as they did when they were alive. But now it is a &#145;Sabbath of the dead&#146;. It is a heart-breaking poetic vision in which MacLean reaches the very heart of the highland experience of desolation and lost community and beauty, Hallaig's ghostly history and its suffering. And yet it is also a resurrection.<br>
<br>Two of MacLean's poems about Ireland are worth mentioning: first, &#145;The National Museum of Ireland&#146;, a poem about the great Irish hero Connolly, on whose shirt the poet sees &#145;the rusty red spot of blood&#146;. Connolly is the hero &#145;who is dearest to me of them all&#146;. In the other poem, &#145;At Yeats' Grave&#146;, MacLean says that &#145;courage and beauty had their flagpoles through your side&#146;. Another fine poem is his elegy on his brother Calum (1915&#150;1960), who died of cancer and by whose bravery in enduring the disease MacLean was greatly struck. Calum was a very distinguished folklorist who had done a spectacular thing, being converted to Catholicism from Free Presbyterianism. MacLean writes:<blockquote>
<div>You dearly bought the pride<br>
</div>
<div>that we bought in your death.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>MacLean also spent a long time on the poem &#145;The Cave of Gold&#146;. Apart from &#145;The Woods of Raasay&#146; all these poems were written during that period, one of which is called &#145;Screapadal&#146;. Screapadal is a deserted township in the north of Raasay, which like Hallaig was cleared of its people. Screapadal is again threatened, this time by a new enemy, a submarine off the sound of Skye. The poet imagines the &#145;sudden holocaust&#146; and the &#145;poisonous bracken&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Risabhruthaichcriticalwritingandlateryears"></a>Ris a' bhruthaich: critical writing and later years</h2>
<span class="italic">Ris a' bhruthaich</span> (&#145;Up the brae&#146;) is subtitled &#145;The criticism and prose writings of Sorley MacLean&#146;. It consists of occasional papers and articles, and three Gaelic short stories, and was published in 1985. The papers were given to the Gaelic Society of Inverness and published in their <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. Other criticism and articles written by MacLean between 1934 and 1976 were published in magazines such as <span class="italic">Scottish Art and Letters</span>, <span class="italic">Gairm</span>, and <span class="italic">Chapman</span>. MacLean's criticism was of foundational importance in the Gaelic context, since very little in the way of properly critical analysis of Gaelic literature had been attempted previously. Much of what existed tended to summarize and to affirm the literature, often in a romantic vein. A critical engagement that assessed the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the material was hardly known; Gaelic scholars of the time tended to be more concerned with language than literature. MacLean was not, however, alone in reacting against the prevailing shallowness and the worship of romantic idols. MacDiarmid had reacted in a similar manner to the romantic reconstructions of Marjory Kennedy Fraser in the 1920s. A Lewisman, Murdo Murray (1890&#150;1964), also began to assess nineteenth-century Gaelic literature in a critical light at much the same time as MacLean, and independently of him. Both MacLean and Murray reacted against the type of romanticism found in the songs and verse of Neil MacLeod and other nineteenth-century sentimentalists, and both wrote critical essays that rehabilitated the verse of Mary MacPherson 
    (M&agrave;iri Mh&ograve;r nan Oran; 1821&#150;1898)
  , the poet of the highland land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s. MacPherson's verbosity and unvarnished realism offended the romantic practitioners of the late nineteenth century and the earlier twentieth century, including MacLean's maternal uncle Alexander Nicolson, who dismissed her verse on Skye as a &#145;glorified tourist guide&#146;.<br>
<br>MacLean, like MacDiarmid, attacked the &#145;Celtic twilight&#146; idea, and much of his criticism was in praise of the great sixteenth- and seventeenth-century songs. The best Gaelic poetry, MacLean pointed out, is hard and clear and objective: &#145;Great poetry may cry in despair for one thing that exists or that it would like to exist, but it never assumes the existence of something which it knows perfectly well doesn't exist&#146;  (MacLean, 17). Again and again in the best Gaelic poetry he showed either the existence of real passion or authentic detail as well as sharp visual imagery. However, he found nineteenth-century poetry &#145;flabby and anaemic: it lacks power, gusto, spontaneity, joie de vivre&#146;  (ibid., 57). He wrote a seminal paper, &#145;The poetry of the clearances&#146;, and he found with some notable exceptions that such poetry suffers from &#145;intellectual weakness&#146;  (ibid., 61). To some extent MacLean overstated his case, and his criticism has helped to darken the pall that still hangs over nineteenth-century Gaelic verse. Nevertheless his analysis demonstrated some of the real strengths of the period, displayed notably in the work of John Smith of Lewis, Mary MacPherson of Skye, and William Livingston of Islay. All three poets had voiced disapproval of the <i>status quo</i> of their own time, and to an extent MacLean's affirmation of their political robustness echoed the sentiments of Hugh MacDiarmid, although it also reflected his admiration for the stand of highland crofters against landlordism in the 1870s and 1880s and the radical socialism that had shaped his own world view in the 1930s. Moving beyond the Gaelic world, MacLean sometimes compared Gaelic poets to English ones. Thus, while Wordsworth infected nature with philosophy, Duncan Ban Macintyre had physical exactness. Similarly he preferred the eighteenth-century love poet William Ross to Keats. Here too what now appears to be a deliberate and probably over-argued attempt to rescue Gaelic literature from the thrall of English perspectives can be detected, reminiscent of MacDiarmid's campaign. Nevertheless MacLean's essays provided the first consistent body of modern analytical writing that took Gaelic literature seriously and applied critical yardsticks to it. There is therefore a clear parallel between his work as a poet who brought Gaelic verse firmly into the twentieth century and as a critic who laid new foundations for Gaelic literary criticism.<br>
<br>Though by their occasional nature these essays tend to be repetitive they are valuable in that they show quite clearly MacLean's grasp of the strengths and weaknesses of Gaelic poetry, and the prolific examples he quotes undoubtedly strengthen his case. Also, to him, the visual and audible were very important, as was &#145;the great lyrical cry&#146; that he found time and again in the passionate songs that he admired. (It is interesting, for instance, that in connection with the Spanish Civil War his favourite poem was Cornford's &#145;Heart of the Heartless World&#146;, a poignant love lyric, rather than, for example, anything by Auden.) In their enthusiasms and clear-headedness these essays show quite clearly the influences on MacLean's poetry.<br>
<br>In appearance Sorley MacLean was tall and well-built. Indeed he himself says in his poem &#145;Going Westwards&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>And be what was as it was,<br>
</div>
<div>I am of the big men of Braes,<br>
</div>
<div>of the heroic Raasay Macleods.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In his youth he played much shinty and was a university blue. He restarted shinty in his period as headmaster at Plockton High School and was a highly competitive instructor to the pupils. He writes too of rowing when he was young and having political arguments with an aunt as he rowed the boat. Later the Cuillins seduced him from the sea.<br>
<br>MacLean admired heroism, and was very proud of his clan and of Gaelic culture, about which he was very knowledgeable. He had a very strong memory and was extremely interested in genealogy. He was friendly and approachable, very much appreciated wit in others, and had a highly developed sense of humour, which was never revealed in his writing. The fact was that as he became older he sometimes fell asleep in company. He did this once, late at night, in the company of fellow poet Norman MacCaig, and to excuse himself he said &#145;he had now got to the stage that he could not guarantee keeping awake, even if he had the company of Voltaire on one side, and Helen of Troy on the other&#146;  (private information). One could imagine him passionate in argument in his youth, one whom the ills of the world would not let rest.<br>
<br>MacLean was in great demand as a reader of his poetry from the time that he retired from teaching, in 1972. He read often in Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, and in Europe. His wife, Renee, accompanied him to many of his readings. He read with passion, though it often seemed that he did not regard his translations very highly in comparison with the original poems. Often in Ireland, MacLean was venerated there as a great Celtic poet. In 1973 he made an album recording of a selection of his poems, <span class="italic">Barran agus Asbhuain</span>, while acting (to 1975) as creative writer in residence at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>MacLean's final <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1989) contains 313 pages composed of Gaelic poems with English translations. His output therefore is not large; he was one of those poets who wrote only under compulsion. As a teacher he was highly conscientious, and it was perhaps because of this that he wrote so little in his latter years. He received many honours, including honorary degrees from eight universities as well as prestigious prizes, especially the queen's medal for poetry. He was also made a freeman of Skye and Lochalsh. <span class="italic">Somhairle: d&agrave;in is deilbh: a Celebration on the 80th Birthday of Sorley MacLean</span> was published in 1991. Yet in spite of all this recognition he was rooted in Skye. It inspired much of the subject matter and the symbolism of his poetry, and it is this rootedness that gave his work most of its authenticity.<br>
<br>Sorley MacLean died on 24 November 1996 at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, of a stroke, and was buried on 28 November at Portree, on the Isle of Skye. By the time of his death his reputation went far beyond Scotland. Increasing interest in his work is evidenced by the numerous articles and critical assessments in academic journals and studies of Scottish and Gaelic literature. A corrected edition of <span class="italic">From Wood to Ridge</span>, containing both English and Gaelic versions of the poems, was published in 1999. In 2002 Christopher Whyte reconstructed the creation of <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do Eimhir</span> as a sequence of sixty-one poems, <span class="italic">Somhairle MacGill-Eain</span>. He examines in detail the emotional, intellectual, and contextual processes that determined its shape, and he provides many insights into the pressures (and not least the poet's own reservations) that affected its presentation in different collections and editions. Even in the first edition, of 1943, twelve poems were missing from the original sequence, and in Whyte's reconstruction one (no. 7) is still lacking. MacLean's personal view of the sequence was at times despairing, as he indicated to Young, and he himself was prepared to publish only certain parts of it. Latterly he took an aversion to it, and denied as lately as 1989 that it was &#145;really a sequence&#146;  (Whyte, 1). It is interesting to consider whether MacLean would have been content with the recreation and restoration of the sequence and the &#145;original&#146; forms of the texts. Whatever the poet's personal inhibitions it is beyond doubt that <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do Eimhir</span> represents a remarkable literary achievement. The edition is a major scholarly contribution to the understanding of MacLean's mind and of the literary world in which he operated in the 1930s and 1940s.<br>
