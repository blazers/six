<span class="headword">Robinson,  Philip Stewart</span>  (1849&#150;1902), <span class="occ">journalist and writer on natural history</span>, was born at Chunar, North-Western Provinces, India, on 13 October 1849, the eldest son in a family of three sons and three daughters of Julian Robinson, Indian army chaplain and editor of <span class="italic">The Pioneer</span>, and his wife, Harriet Woodcocke, daughter of Thomas Sharpe DD, vicar of Doncaster and canon of York. After education at Marlborough College (1860&#150;65), he was from 1866 to 1868 librarian of the free library in Cardiff. He resigned this post to go to India, where he assisted his father in editing <span class="italic">The Pioneer</span> in 1869. In 1872 he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Records of the Benares Collectorate</span> (2 vols., 1876), and in the following year became professor of literature, and then in 1875 of logic and metaphysics, in Allahabad College. He edited the <span class="italic">Cameleon: an Anglo-Indian Periodical of Light Literature</span> in 1872&#150;3, and later became censor of the vernacular press. Robinson returned to England in 1877 and joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> as leader writer. In the same year he married Elizabeth King. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1878&#150;9 Robinson served as correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and in the Anglo-Zulu War, and during the next five years he acted as publisher's reader for Sampson Low &amp; Co. and edited and prepared for the press H. M. Stanley's <span class="italic">Through the Dark Continent</span> (1878). In 1881&#150;2 he travelled the United States as special commissioner of the <span class="italic">New York World</span>, publishing his experiences as <span class="italic">Sinners and Saints</span> (1883; new edn, 1892). Later in 1882 he went to Egypt as war correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, and in 1885 he was in the Sudan. Subsequently he made lecturing tours through the United States and Australia, and in 1898 was correspondent at first of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and then of the Associated Press in Cuba during the Spanish&#150;American War. The hardships of the Cuban campaigns, including imprisonment and fever, undermined his health, and in his last year he wrote very little.<br>
<br>In addition to his many newspaper and journal contributions, Robinson published some twenty-three works between 1871 and 1902, the majority being keenly observed, whimsically humorous essays on Indian natural history. These included his <span class="roman">Indian Garden</span> series&#151;<span class="italic">Chasing a Fortune</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Tigers at Large</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">The Valley of Teetotum Trees</span> (1886)&#151;which enjoyed the largest circulation of any of his works. In this respect he might be considered one of the pioneers of Anglo-Indian literature, yet his work guaranteed him little lasting reputation. Other diverse topics of his work included mythological fishes (1883), Cyprus (1878), and the Indian famine (1877). Between 1882 and 1899 he contributed twenty-one articles to the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. He also wrote for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Harper's Monthly</span>. Robinson died on 9 December 1902.<br>
