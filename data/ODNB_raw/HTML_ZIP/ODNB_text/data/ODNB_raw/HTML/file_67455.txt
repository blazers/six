<span class="headword">Goodman,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1592, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was baptized at Ruthin, Denbighshire, on 7 November 1592, the son of Gawen Goodman and his second wife, Gaynor Price. He was therefore a first cousin to Godfrey Goodman, bishop of Gloucester, whose ambivalent relationship to the Church of Rome made him an object of suspicion to his more godly colleagues. John Goodman was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1612, graduating BA in 1617. He took orders on 20 September 1618 and went to London, where he was curate of St Nicholas Olave for a time before his conversion to Catholicism by Richard Ireland. This took place in Paris about 1621 and Goodman entered the seminary at Douai on 12 February 1621, but left in minor orders on 6 May 1624 for the Jesuit noviciate at Watten. He did not proceed with the Jesuits, but was ordained as a secular priest somewhere in France about 1631. He returned to England, but was soon arrested and imprisoned in Newgate from 1632 until about 1635, when he was discharged. The release of an active and zealous priest with connections to the establishment was criticized by puritans like William Prynne, and Goodman's freedom was short-lived, for he was prisoner in the Gatehouse on 1 July 1637. He was released shortly afterwards but imprisoned, once again in the Gatehouse, in 1639. Another brief period of freedom followed before his arrest on 17 January 1640 and indictment as a priest on 29 August. He was found not guilty, but on the evidence of a fellow prisoner was later condemned to death on 21 January 1641. His influential connections and the possible intervention of Queen Henrietta Maria secured a reprieve from Charles I, but in the heightened political temperature of the day Goodman's case became an important issue between crown and parliament, the king receiving a remonstrance from both houses demanding Goodman's execution. Lengthy statements were prepared by both his supporters and opponents, with parliament referring especially to his former status as a Church of England clergyman as a further factor against him. In the worsening relations between king and parliament Goodman intervened personally, petitioning Charles that he, Goodman, might be executed rather than become a source of division between the parties. Goodman's letter resulted in parliament withdrawing its demand for the death penalty, a compromise was effected, and Goodman was committed to prison indefinitely, dying in Newgate some time in 1645.<br>
