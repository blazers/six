<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James</span>, first duke of Leinster  (1722&#150;1773), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 29 May 1722 at Carton, co. Kildare, Ireland, the second son but surviving heir of Robert Fitzgerald, nineteenth earl of Kildare (1675&#150;1744), landowner, and Lady Mary O'Brien (1692&#150;1780), eldest daughter of William O'Brien, third earl of Inchiquin (<i>d</i>. 1719). After being educated at home he embarked on a grand tour through France and Italy, which lasted from February 1737 to September 1739. In April 1740 he became heir apparent to the Fitzgerald estate, with rentals of &pound;15,000 per annum in 1745, and took the title Lord Offaly. He succeeded his father as twentieth earl of Kildare on 20 February 1744. He married Lady Emily Lennox (1731&#150;1814) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48893/', "Fitzgerald, Emilia Mary, duchess of Leinster")</script>], second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16450/', "Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond (1701&#150;1750)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Sarah Cadogan (<i>d</i>. 1751), on 7 February 1747. The marriage brought him important political connections&#151;for his wife's brother-in-law was Henry Fox&#151;great happiness, and a small dowry of &pound;10,000. Emily Fitzgerald, Lady Kildare and later duchess of Leinster, encouraged him to complete all the building work and garden design at Carton House and then to commission the same architect, Richard Castle, to build a grand Palladian house in Kildare Street, Dublin. Later home to the Royal Dublin Society and then to the Republic of Ireland's Oireachtas or parliament, Leinster House became the focus of the rapid architectural development on the south side of the Liffey River. Setting or following the trends of fashions in art, architecture, and interiors was to mean that Kildare left debts of &pound;148,000 at his death in 1773.<br>
<br>On 17 October 1741 Offaly, as he then was, entered political life with a seat for Athy borough in the Irish parliament, and, during the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland of 1745, he offered to raise an infantry regiment to serve if Ireland was invaded. Politics and the military life were to remain the great pressing interests in his life. He was sworn of the Irish privy council on 12 May 1746 and on 1 February 1747 was created an English peer, as Viscount Leinster of Taplow, Buckinghamshire, owing to the influence of his uncle, the third earl of Inchiquin, and his father-in-law. In politics his ambition was to become the leading politician after Speaker Boyle and he sought to achieve this by cultivating his electoral interests in Leinster, particularly in counties Kildare and Carlow, and his growing popularity with the protestant gentry, who shared his patriot politics. Two of the most skilled orators in the Irish Commons, Thomas Carter and Anthony Malone, who represented Leinster constituencies, found him politically attractive. In addition, his brother-in-law, Henry Fox, with whom he had a stormy relationship, throughout the 1750s and 1760s seemed on the verge of breaking the Pelhamite hold on whig politics in England. Kildare was always hampered by his major character flaw, an inability to contemplate political compromise, even when it did not threaten his integrity. The decade of the 1750s, when he was in his thirties, was a key one in determining his political career. His fierce opposition, as the most determined patriot leader, between 1750 and 1755 to the viceroy, the duke of Dorset, and his allies, especially Archbishop Stone, marked him out. He was f&ecirc;ted in Ireland as a patriot icon and despised in much of the political world in London for his rash memorial of July 1753, which demanded that George II remove his viceroy from Ireland. Although he pursued a stronger opposition line than Henry Boyle, he was persuaded by his family and his sense of whig service to the crown to act as a peacemaker for the next viceroy, Lord Hartington, and was rewarded by his sole appointment as lord justice on 11 May 1756.<br>
<br>Kildare's hostility to Archbishop Stone and his refusal of any kind of expediency led him in February 1758 to reject a settlement between the primate and the viceroy, the duke of Bedford. However, he was appointed to a post which allowed him to indulge his military ambitions, that of master-general of the ordnance, on 12 October 1758. He threw himself into this office with great energy, creating the Royal Irish Artillery in March 1760 and becoming its first colonel. On 11 November 1761 he was commissioned lieutenant-general and then on 30 March 1770 major-general. Yet he also showed why he was difficult to work with, continually clashing with Lord Ligonier and the earl of Rothes, successive commanders-in-chief in Ireland, over jurisdiction. On 19 March 1761 he was created a marquess, and he finally achieved his ambition to be the first peer in Ireland, when created duke of Leinster on 26 November 1766, after George III fulfilled his promise to ennoble him at the same time as he created a new duke in England. In politics Leinster remained occasionally active in the House of Lords and on the privy council, often as an opponent of the government. Disappointed in his hopes of replacing Henry Boyle as chief undertaker and leading lord justice, he veered between paying court to viceroys, such as Lord Hertford (1756&#150;6), and showing open hostility to them. A victim of the latter was Lord Townshend, who between 1767 and 1772 attempted to reform the system of parliamentary management. Leinster strongly opposed both Townshend's methods, including the division of the revenue board in order to increase civil patronage, and his aims, especially the augmentation of the Irish army. His last intervention was characteristic: after he had been dismissed from the privy council in June 1770 he signed a Lords protest in March 1771 against the continuation of Lord Townshend as the viceroy because of his alleged corruption of the Irish parliament. Despite such gestures, he was becoming outflanked by newer patriot leaders, such as Henry Flood and Lord Charlemont. He died on 19 November 1773, aged fifty-one, at his home, Leinster House, in Dublin, and was buried in Christ Church in the city. He was survived by his wife and fourteen of their nineteen children, of whom two of their sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9588/', "Admiral William Robert Fitzgerald, second duke of Leinster (1749&#150;1804)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9546/', "Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1763&#150;1798)")</script>, played prominent, albeit differing, roles in Irish politics in the second half of the eighteenth century. Their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59363/', "Lady Lucy Anne Fitzgerald")</script> was a renowned radical.<br>
