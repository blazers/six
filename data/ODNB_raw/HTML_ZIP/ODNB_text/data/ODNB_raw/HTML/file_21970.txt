<span class="headword">Perkins,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1545?), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, is said by Wood to have been &#145;born of genteel parents&#146; and to have studied grammar and logic at Oxford  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.147), though whether he had any direct evidence for these assertions is unclear. If the Master Walbeiff whom Perkins referred to as his old master may be identified as John Waldboeuf, an official in Brecknockshire, then an origin in south Wales seems likely. Perkins was admitted to the Inner Temple about 1518, when he was assigned a chamber in &#145;Le Lane Syde&#146;, and called to the bar in due course. There is nothing to suggest that he had much to do thereafter with the affairs of the inn, which in 1530 discharged him from all offices except those of steward and reader, and in 1539 sued him for outstanding dues. In fact he never did read and did not become a bencher (as stated in some sources), and no contemporary evidence has been found of the extensive practice claimed for him by Wood. Indeed, there was a rumour&#151;which Perkins felt obliged to deny as a slander in 1537&#151;that his &#145;heels was turned upward&#146; in Westminster Hall twenty years earlier  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/115, fol. 110<i>v</i>), a punishment meted out to dishonest attorneys rather than barristers.<br>
<br>Certainly by the later 1530s Perkins was residing and practising in Oxford, where he became a thorn in the side of the university and Osney Abbey. In his later years he became mentally unbalanced. He wrote a long letter to Cromwell in 1537 proposing a means of suppressing the northern rising by a combination of espionage and terror, such as killing women and children, and a scheme for dissolving and remodelling on secular lines the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, each of which would be required to do away with academical dress and raise and maintain a contingent of archers and halberdiers. A flimsy accusation of treason and unmentionable vices which he simultaneously flung against two local abbots led to imprisonment, banishment from Oxford, and an end as obscure as his beginning. Bale said he died in 1545, and Wood conjectured (probably wrongly) that he was buried in Temple Church.<br>
<br>Despite his disturbed professional and personal life, Perkins was a household name for generations of law students by reason of his little book on land law, called <span class="italic">Perkins' Profitable Book</span>, which first appeared (in law French) in 1528 under the Latin title <span class="italic">Perutilis tractatus magistri Johannis Parkins interioris Templi socii</span>. A manuscript version in the British Library (Hargrave MS 244), fairly copied but lacking the last page or two, seems to be more or less coeval with the first printing. There were three further editions in French, and then an English translation in 1555 (<span class="italic">A Verie Profitable Booke Treating of the Lawes of this Realme</span>) which went through seventeen editions or reprintings before 1660, was again reprinted in 1757, enjoyed a Dublin edition in 1792, and reached its final form in a new edition (called the fifteenth), with notes by Richard J. Greening of the Inner Temple, in 1827. There is a different English translation by Gilbert Trobridge, admitted to the Middle Temple in 1594, in the British Library (Harley MS 5035). The English versions are divided into eleven chapters (dealing with grants, deeds, feoffments, exchanges, dower, curtesy, wills, devises, surrenders, reservations, and conditions) and 845 numbered sections. The <span class="italic">Profitable Book</span> was intended as a kind of supplement to Littleton's <span class="italic">Tenures</span>, dealing chiefly with points of conveyancing which were not to be found in Littleton, and it does not therefore have the coherence or elegance of Littleton's great work. It nevertheless has a thoughtful jurisprudential preface, is clearly written, and was considered authoritative. Coke praised it as witty and learned, though in 1600 William Fulbeck offered the more severe opinion that &#145;it might be wished that he had written with less sharpness of wit, so he had discoursed with more depth of judgment&#146;  (Fulbeck, 72).<br>
