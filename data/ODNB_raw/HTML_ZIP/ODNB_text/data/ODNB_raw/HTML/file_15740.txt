<span class="headword">Knight,  William</span>  (1786&#150;1844), <span class="occ">natural philosopher</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 17 September 1786, the son of William Knight, a bookseller in that city and his wife, Janet Hoyes. In 1793 he entered the Aberdeen grammar school, where he was a contemporary of Lord Byron (whose disposition he described in later life as most damnable). He entered the Marischal College in 1798, graduated MA there in 1802, and delivered several courses of lectures to the students in natural history and chemistry between 1810 and 1816. He also published, in 1813, his <span class="italic">Outlines of Botany</span>.<br>
<br>In 1816 Knight was elected to the professorship of natural philosophy in the Belfast Academical Institution. In 1817 he received from Marischal College the degree of LLD, and in the following year he published his chief work, <span class="italic">Facts and Observations towards Forming a New Theory of the Earth</span>, a series of papers on geological subjects. This was followed in 1820 by <span class="italic">First Day in Heaven, a Fragment</span>, a curious book, which Knight himself subsequently suppressed. On 17 September 1821 Knight married Jean, the eldest daughter of George Glennie, professor of moral philosophy at Marischal College. The couple later had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Knight returned to Aberdeen from Belfast in 1822 when he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at the Marischal College. His style of lecturing, according to Professor Masson, was characterized by much pungency, occasionally relieved by a &#145;sarcastic scurrility which no other lecturer ventured on, and which was far from pleasant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, 9.331). Though his teaching was varied and interesting, its effect was greatly marred by the shallowness of his mathematical knowledge.<br>
<br>Knight died at Aberdeen on 3 December 1844. He left eight volumes of manuscript collections relating to Marischal College which went to the library of the University of Aberdeen (and formed the basis of the <span class="italic">Fasti academiae Mariscallanae</span>, edited by P. J. Anderson for the New Spalding Club). He also left relatives some autobiographical material which was said to contain racy criticisms of contemporaries.<br>
