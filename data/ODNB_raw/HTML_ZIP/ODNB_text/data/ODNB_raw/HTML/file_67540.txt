<span class="headword">Magennis,  Arthur</span>, third Viscount Magennis of Iveagh  (1623/1626&#150;1683), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son and heir of Hugh Magennis, later second Viscount Magennis of Iveagh (1599&#150;1639), and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1641), the daughter of Sir John Bellew of Castletown, co. Louth. He was a minor, aged either thirteen or sixteen, at the time of his father's death in 1639 but, following representations by his kinsman the earl of Antrim, the government did not insist on asserting wardship on the grounds that &#145;the youth [Arthur Magennis] hath but little time to be in wardship and was soured already&#146;  (Ohlmeyer, 54). In other words he was too old to be a likely convert to protestantism. Iveagh's inheritance (some 44,800 acres), like the estates of most surviving native landowners in Ulster, was threatened by indebtedness; it was valued at &pound;1200 per annum but a third of this was tied up in a jointure to his grandmother Viscountess Sara (<i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Neill, daughter of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone) and the rest was encumbered by a debt of &pound;4500.<br>
<br>Iveagh was in Dublin when the 1641 rising broke out in October of that year. By the following February he had returned to south co. Down where he reportedly participated in the burning of Downpatrick. In April and May 1642 he led an army of some 2500 men in trying to halt the southward advance of Monro's newly arrived Scottish covenanter army. Monro subsequently captured Newry and the town and its hinterland remained in protestant hands throughout the 1640s.<br>
<br>Having been forced to leave Ulster, in November 1643 Iveagh was selected as a member of the supreme council, the standing executive of the confederate Catholic regime. As an inducement for French financial aid, the supreme council in 1644 agreed to permit a regiment of infantry to be raised in Ireland for the French service. In November Iveagh embarked at Galway as colonel of this regiment. He subsequently returned and served as colonel of an infantry regiment in Owen Roe O'Neill's army during the latter's campaign in Connaught in summer 1647. By then the confederate Catholics were beginning to sunder into Ormondist and clericalist factions, divided mainly by the religious guarantees in any proposed peace treaty with the royalists. O'Neill's Ulster army, too, split in May 1649. Those officers who owned land in Ulster before the war, including Iveagh, Alexander Mac Donnell, and Phelim O'Neill, sided with the Ormondist party against Owen O'Neill. Oliver Cromwell's lightning campaign in Ireland (September 1649&#150;May 1650) forced an uneasy rapprochement and in March 1650 Iveagh formally acknowledged to the Catholic primate that he had &#145;sinned against natural, no less than human law&#146;  (O'Ferrall and O'Connell, 4.396). In return the primate lifted the sentence of excommunication laid on him for his adherence to the Ormondist party.<br>
<br>Although Iveagh was away from his regiment when it was attacked by Cromwell in October 1649 as part of the garrison defending Wexford, he remained for the dying days of the Catholic and royalist cause. He was a signatory to last minute reassertions of unity and appeals for foreign aid sent from Inishbofin (off the coast of Galway) in July and August 1652. In March 1653 he signed articles for the surrender of Belturbet (co. Cavan), making this along with nearby Cloughoughter (surrendered in April) the very last Irish strongholds to hold out. The conditions of surrender allowed him to recruit a regiment for service in the Spanish army. Some time after this he transported and, in 1660, was listed as captain-lieutenant (acting company commander) in the duke of Gloucester's regiment of infantry in Spanish Flanders.<br>
<br>Iveagh lost all his estates in the Cromwellian confiscations and after the Restoration these were not restored to him, despite the intervention of Charles II. Iveagh continued in the king's service abroad for a number of years, but about 1662 he was in prison in London, having been obliged to live on credit in England. Some time afterwards the king awarded him an estate of 1860 acres in Ballintober barony, co. Roscommon, and an annual pension of &pound;150, subsequently raised to &pound;500. This was &pound;1600 in arrears and had fallen back to &pound;300 p.a. at the time of his death in Dublin on 30 April 1683. He was buried on 1 May in St Catherine's Church and was survived by his wife, Margaret, daughter of Philip McHugh O'Reilly of co. Cavan, and four daughters, three of whom were married in 1688; his brother Hugh succeeded to the title. The Ballintober estate may have been sold before his death or shortly after; at any rate it is not included in the list of confiscated Jacobite estates dealt with by the Chichester House trustees after the Williamite wars (1689&#150;91). On the other hand the estate may not have been confiscated, because while the eldest son and heir of his brother, Brian, Lord Iveagh, was an active Jacobite, he enlisted in the service of Austria (an ally of William III) rather than France after the war.<br>
