<span class="headword">Boulton, Sir  Harold Edwin</span>, second baronet  (1859&#150;1935), <span class="occ">songwriter and philanthropist</span>, was born at Lower Woolwich Road, Charlton, Kent, on 7 August 1859, the elder son and third of eight children of Samuel Bagster Boulton (1830&#150;1918), of Copped Hall, Totteridge, Hertfordshire, who was created baronet in 1905, and his wife, Sophia Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of Thomas Cooper of Newbury, Berkshire. Samuel Boulton was co-founder of Burt, Boulton, and Haywood Ltd, timber merchants and chemical manufacturers; he was also winner in 1884 of the Telford medal for research in the chemical industry, and a founder in 1889 of the London Labour Conciliation and Arbitration Board. Harold Boulton was educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a third in classical moderations in 1879 and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1881. With James Rennell Rodd he founded and edited a magazine of contemporary poetry, and he was runner-up for the Newdigate prize poem in his final year.<br>
<br>Boulton had enjoyed singing at Harrow, where he led the school choir, and after an undergraduate reading party in Scotland he became interested in Scottish folk-songs and their preservation, and wrote new words to traditional melodies himself. The most famous of these was <span class="italic">Skye Boat Song</span> (1884), which tells the story of the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie (Charles Edward Stuart) after his defeat at Culloden in 1746. He wrote English words for <span class="italic">All through the Night</span>, the traditional Welsh lullaby, and edited many collections of songs, including <span class="italic">Songs of the North</span>, in three volumes (1885, 1905, and 1925), gathered from the highlands and lowlands of Scotland; <span class="italic">Songs of the Four Nations (1892)</span>; <span class="italic">National Songs and some Ballads (1908)</span>; and <span class="italic">Prince Charlie in Song</span> (1933), a collection of Jacobite songs. His lyrics were set to music by well-known composers, including Charles Villiers Stanford, who wrote the music for &#145;For Ever Mine&#146; (1891), and Granville Bantock, who set &#145;Song to the Seals&#146;. Edward German wrote the music for many of the songs, including &#145;Glorious Devon&#146; (1905) and &#145;The Drummer Boy&#146; (1908). Boulton's published poetry includes <span class="italic">Songs Sung and Unsung</span> (1894), <span class="italic">The Ballad of Thyra Lee</span> (1899), and <span class="italic">Lyrics and other Poems</span> (1902). In 1926 he published <span class="italic">The Huntress Hag of the Blackwater</span>, a medieval romance in verse, which was followed by <span class="italic">An Unrecorded Miracle of St Columba</span> (1930) and the verse saga <span class="italic">Olaf and Uaine</span> (1934), &#145;a tale of a thousand years ago&#146;. Boulton was an ovate bard of Wales and president of the Scottish Literature and Song Association in 1929, and was made a director of the Royal Academy of Music in 1931. He was also honorary secretary of the Keats&#150;Shelley Memorial Association from 1906 to 1926, and was present at the opening of the memorial in the piazza di Spagna, in Rome.<br>
<br>Boulton became involved in the university settlement movement shortly after leaving Oxford. Toynbee Hall was founded in January 1884 in the East End of London by a group of Balliol men, but Boulton was one of those mainly associated with Keble College and the high-church party, and supported by Octavia Hill, who thought that a settlement should be religious in character: Oxford House opened in the autumn of 1884 in a disused church school in the large slum parish of St Andrew, Bethnal Green, the most densely populated district of east London. There the focus was on setting up clubs for working men&#151;as an alternative to public houses&#151;and for boys. The Oxford House Club, founded in 1885, was the first started in the East End and became a model for other clubs. Among its many other cultural and sporting activities it was famous for its male voice choir. Boulton, with James Granville Adderley, head of Oxford House from 1885 to 1886, founded the Federation of Working Men's Social Clubs, and by the time he was elected president in 1895 there were sixty-five federated clubs. He remained president until 1930. While living at Oxford House he helped to found the People's Palace Horticultural Society, which was an offshoot of the People's Palace which had opened in 1887, and with Charles Bethune he founded the House of Shelter at Bow, where homeless men could find refuge and help in getting employment. In 1932 he was elected chairman of the Mendicity Society. Boulton remained at Oxford House until his marriage, on 26 January 1889, to Adelaide Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1926), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan Henry Caithness Reay Davidson, of Tulloch Castle, Dingwall, Scotland. They had two sons, the younger of whom was killed in action in 1917, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Boulton had joined the family firm after leaving Oxford and touring Canada, and in 1903 he and his father started the Dominion Tar and Chemical Company in Nova Scotia, setting up tar-distillery companies and creosoting plants. He visited Canada at least once a year until 1918, when he became chairman on the death of his father and inherited the baronetcy. He sold the company in 1929. Before the First World War he was a captain in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and during the war he served in the City of London yeomanry, the rough riders. He was appointed CBE in 1918. He was president of the Associated Tar Distillers and a member of the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers from its foundation in 1916. First president of the British Association of Wood Preservers in 1930, in that year he published <span class="italic">A Century of Wood Preserving</span>.<br>
<br>Boulton's interests also extended to medical and nursing organizations: he was a member of the committee of the London Hospital from 1896 to 1921; he helped to organize bush nursing in Australia in 1910; he was vice-president of the Queen's Institute for Nurses, and chairman from 1908 to 1932; from 1909 to 1914 he was honorary commissioner for Canada of the St John Ambulance Association; he was chairman of Queen Mary's Hostel for Nurses from 1918 to 1921; and chairman of the committee for the national memorial to Queen Alexandra from 1926 to 1928.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife on 26 April 1926, Boulton remarried on 29 December 1926. His second wife was Margaret Cunningham McKennet (<i>d</i>. 1938), widow of Robert Charles Simpson Moodie of Montreal, and daughter of James Lennox Lyons of Montreal. Boulton died at Grosvenor House, Park Lane, London, on 1 June 1935 after a long illness. A requiem mass was held on 4 June at Farm Street Church, London; he was buried at Brookwood cemetery the same day.<br>
