<span class="headword">Greaves, Sir  George Richards</span>  (1831&#150;1922), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 9 November 1831 at Briery Close, Lowwood, Windermere, Westmorland, one of the eight children of George Greaves, a retired captain in the 60th rifles. Greaves's mother had poor health and the family went abroad in 1838, eventually settling at Gr&auml;tz, with the result that three of his brothers subsequently joined the Austrian services. Greaves himself attended a number of continental day schools but, intended by his father for the Royal Artillery, returned to Quartman's preparatory school, Woolwich. The unexpected death of Greaves's sponsor left him without nomination to the Royal Military Academy, but an uncle secured nomination to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on 13 October 1846, and Greaves was commissioned as ensign without purchase in the 70th foot on 30 November 1849.<br>
<br>Greaves joined the 70th in India in October 1850, being promoted lieutenant on 16 January 1852. The routine of regimental service was alleviated by a spell as deputy assistant adjutant-general during the Usofzai expedition on the north-west frontier in 1857&#150;8, Greaves's regiment remaining on the frontier throughout the mutiny. After becoming regimental adjutant in May 1858, Greaves married Ellen, the daughter of Brigadier-General Hutchison, on 9 July 1859. Promoted captain on 11 October 1859, Greaves next accompanied his regiment to New Zealand in January 1861, becoming deputy assistant quartermaster-general on the staff and surveying the Waikato River country. He was present at actions against the Maori at Mangatawhiri, the Gate Pa, and Weraroa Pa. Promoted to both a brevet majority and a lieutenant-colonelcy as a result of his services on 1 March 1864 and 21 March 1865 respectively, he brought part of the 70th home and, having turned down the offer of an appointment in Ceylon, became brigade major at Dover in April 1867. Greaves was then appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general at the Horse Guards on 1 June 1870, sharing an office with Garnet Wolseley.<br>
<br>Greaves's particular passion in India had been sport; introduced to a form of callisthenics by a fellow officer, he had developed a powerful physique. Wolseley laid particular store on physical strength and later described Greaves as &#145;a good sportsman, strong and healthy in body and resolute in mind&#146;  (Wolseley, <span class="italic">Story of a Soldier's Life</span>, 2.280). However, Wolseley also added that Greaves was &#145;with strong opinions&#151;I might even add prejudices&#146; and, in many respects, this was to become Greaves's defining characteristic to the ultimate detriment of his career. One officer wrote that Greaves was a &#145;short, sharp-featured individual, with a pompous and rather disagreeable manner, a loud voice, a quick temper, and a sense of his own importance which defied everything&#146;  (E. G. Parry, <span class="italic">Suakin</span>, 1885, 120). Another recalled Greaves as having &#145;an old-fashioned vocabulary of exceptional virulence and potency&#146;  (Younghusband, 95). Yet, he also had a roguish charm. His first wife died in 1880, but Greaves had already made the acquaintance of Julia Rose Venour, daughter of the Revd E. Morris and wife of W. Venour, the doctor of the 15th hussars. Mrs Venour was certainly Greaves's mistress by 1884, but he then took up with Mrs Rochfort-Boyd  (Lady Wolseley to Wolseley, 27 Nov and 25 Dec 1884, Hove, LW/P 10/28 and 30). He married the widowed Mrs Venour in 1908; she survived him.<br>
<br>Wolseley wanted Greaves as chief of staff on his Asante expedition in 1873, but the commander-in-chief, the duke of Cambridge, feared criticism if two of his staff secured the principal appointments while also claiming Greaves was too young, despite being older than Wolseley. However, the wounding of John McNeill led to Greaves, who had received a brevet colonelcy on 12 September 1872, being sent in December 1873, receiving the CB for his services. Greaves then returned to the Horse Guards as assistant adjutant-general in April 1874, serving on the Stanley committee in 1877. In July 1878 Greaves again accompanied Wolseley as chief of staff to Cyprus, succeeding him as administrator in May 1879. However, Greaves believed the island insufficiently healthy for a major British base, offending government by the forthright public expression of his views. As Wolseley was to remark, Greaves &#145;has yet to learn that it does not do to insert the whole truth in official correspondence&#146;  (Wolseley to Lady Wolseley, 8&#150;13 Aug, 1879, Hove, W/P 8/19). Indeed, Greaves did not secure the KCMG for which Wolseley had recommended him until May 1881.<br>
<br>Greaves escaped Cyprus in July 1879 on appointment, at Wolseley's suggestion, as adjutant-general in India, the Second Anglo-Afghan War having broken out. Cambridge had favoured T. D. Baker, but he was private secretary to the viceroy, Lord Lytton, and the commander-in-chief in India, Sir Frederick Haines, advised against any impression that the new incumbent was Lytton's nominee. Greaves, who took up his post on 30 October 1879, suggested in his memoirs that he acted as chief of staff to Haines at Lytton's request, at the same time loyally supporting Haines in his frequent clashes with Lytton. In reality, as Lytton complained, Greaves's &#145;incessant endeavour&#146; was to &#145;get the entire control of military operations, little by little, through the CinC, into his own hands&#146;  (Lytton to Roberts, 20&#150;21 March 1880, Roberts MSS 7101-23-37/84). Moreover, Greaves urged himself on Haines as chief of staff directing field operations while simultaneously endeavouring to prevent Haines from taking the field personally by communicating Haines's intentions to Lytton through his fellow Wolseley prot&eacute;g&eacute; Henry Brackenbury.<br>
<br>Having been promoted major-general on 25 October 1882, Greaves completed his term in India on 31 October 1884, being chosen almost immediately for the expedition to Suakin in February 1885. Wolseley had urged the appointment of either McNeill or Greaves to command, but Cambridge refused on the grounds that both were junior to the commander at Suakin, Major-General A. J. Lyon-Fremantle. The unhappy compromise was Sir Gerald Graham in command, with Greaves as chief of staff and McNeill and Fremantle each commanding a brigade. Even before they left England, Greaves was referring to Graham as a &#145;fiddle headed fool&#146;  (Lady Wolseley to Wolseley, 11 Feb 1885, Hove, LW/P 11/7). Sent to report on the situation after the near-disastrous action at Tofrek in March, Wolseley concluded that &#145;every one seemed to desire to play his own hand and to think solely of himself whilst he hated and ridiculed his neighbour&#146;  (Wolseley to Lady Wolseley, 20&#150;27 May 1885, Hove, W/P 14/13). Indeed, Wolseley now believed Greaves could not be entrusted with more than a divisional command in future. Greaves briefly commanded at Suakin after the main expedition's withdrawal and was rewarded with the KCB in August 1885 before returning to India to command the Meerut division in November.<br>
<br>Greaves was made commander-in-chief in Bombay on 14 March 1890, receiving promotion to lieutenant-general on 11 October 1890. His tenure was marked by improvements to the hospitals and barrack accommodation of Indian troops as well as the establishment of Deolali as a convalescence camp for British troops. Greaves also improved musketry standards and marked the young Douglas Haig as suitable for Staff College training. Greaves expected to succeed Roberts as commander-in-chief in India in October 1892, blaming his subsequent passing over by the much junior Sir George White on the accession of the Liberal government at home and the machinations of Roberts. However, as Brackenbury noted, Greaves's defects of character had ruled him out of consideration from the beginning: &#145;He is very quarrelsome &amp; rude&#151;jealousy being always the cause of his rudeness&#146;  (H. Brackenbury to R. Buller, 19 July 1892, Buller MSS 2065M/SS4/27). Greaves promptly resigned his command and left India two years early on 31 March 1893.<br>
<br>Greaves was promoted full general and created GCB upon his retirement in 1896, becoming honorary colonel of the East Surrey regiment in 1898 to add to that of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway volunteer rifle corps, which he had assumed in India. He settled at Netherwood, Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire, where he died on 11 April 1922.<br>
