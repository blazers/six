<span class="headword">Farley,  John</span>  (1755/6&#150;1827), <span class="occ">cook and writer on cookery</span>, is a figure about whom little is known apart from his highly successful book, <span class="italic">The London Art of Cookery</span> published in 1783; it went into twelve editions by 1811. It includes a handsome and youthful likeness of Farley.<br>
<br>Farley's name first appears on 6 May 1778, when the Vintners' Company registered his name as a freeman by servitude. He is listed in the company's records as a servant at the London tavern in Bishopsgate, London, but by 1783 he was described by his publishers as principal cook there. Although a freeman of the Vintners' Company, Farley was also known to the Cooks' Company, as an undated cryptic note found in the Cooks' Company records reveals: &#145;a Cook he works at the London Tavern &hellip; employed there sometime, Roast and Boil'd, he has made a Ragout, Receiving Wages for it, Paid as a servant&#146;  (Cooks' Company MSS).<br>
<br>Farley's claim to fame has rested solely on his cookery book, although this is now known to be the work of a hack writer, Richard Johnson. Ninety per cent of <span class="italic">The London Art of Cookery</span> was compiled from the two culinary best-sellers of the eighteenth century, without ever acknowledging his female sources. These were Hannah Glasse's <span class="italic">The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</span> (first published 1747) and Elizabeth Raffald's <span class="italic">The Experienced English Housekeeper</span> (first published 1769). The remaining 10 per cent of Farley's book came from several other eighteenth-century cookery books. Copyright laws did not cover the field at that time and other contemporary cookery writers borrowed material. Johnson appears not only to have used two-thirds of Glasse's book and half of Raffald's to compile Farley's book, but his copying technique involved changing the first and last lines of each recipe without seemingly improving the original text to any marked degree. His selection of excellent and often workable recipes, however, may well account for the book's popularity.<br>
<br>The year following publication of <span class="italic">The London Art of Cookery</span>, on 7 April 1784, Farley paid the required fine of &pound;26 5<i>s</i>. to become a member of the livery of the Vintners' Company. In 1792 he was still listed in the company's records as being cook at the London tavern. In April 1808 he became a member of the court of assistants of the Vintners' Company at a fine of &pound;50 and on 8 June 1819 he achieved the honour of being elected master. As master of one of the twelve superior companies of the City he was invited to assist the chief butler of England on the day of George IV's coronation. Farley's last recorded attendance at the court of assistants was on 13 April 1824. He died at his home in Clapham Common on 25 November 1827. Farley was presumably married; his son Thomas joined the Vintners' Company on 4 October 1809.<br>
