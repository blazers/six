<span class="headword">Hewson,  John</span>, appointed Lord Hewson under the protectorate  (<em>fl. </em>1630&#150;1660), <span class="occ">army officer and regicide</span>, rose to prominence from low social origins. During the 1630s he was employed as a shoemaker or cobbler in Westminster and Edward Hyde later claimed that he was also for a time a brewer's clerk. In 1642 he enlisted in the parliamentarian forces and subsequently served under the earls of Essex and Manchester. On the formation of the New Model Army in 1645 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Colonel Pickering's regiment and in July of that year he took part in the storming of Bridgwater in Somerset. On Pickering's death in December 1645 Hewson succeeded him as colonel. In 1646 while stationed in the Oxford area, he illegally preached several times in a local parish church, denouncing the incumbent minister as an agent of Antichrist.<br>
<br>During 1647 Hewson was heavily involved in the political struggle between the army and parliament. In April he was chosen as one of the commissioners to represent the army's grievances to parliament and he subsequently presented the army's charges against the eleven presbyterian members. In November he took part in the debates of the army council at Putney, and at their close was one of those charged with drawing up instructions to be communicated to the army at the proposed general rendezvous. In December 1647 he joined his fellow officers in a prayer meeting at Windsor.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1648 Hewson helped to put down the royalist uprising in Kent. His regiment fought at Maidstone, assisted in the relief of Dover, and captured castles at Deal, Walmer, and Sandwich. In December 1648 he assisted Colonel Pride in his purge of parliament and at the subsequent debates of the army council at Whitehall he argued that the magistrate had a right to enforce the moral law. He was subsequently named as one of Charles I's judges and attended the court regularly during January 1649 and signed the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>For all his religious radicalism Hewson was a staunch opponent of the Levellers, and in May 1649 helped Cromwell crush them at Burford. The following autumn he was part of Cromwell's expeditionary force sent to reconquer Ireland. He took part in the sack of Drogheda&#151;subsequently commenting that if the Irish did not submit &#145;the lord by his power shall break them in pieces like a potter's vessel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Occurences</span>). He was involved in the relief of Arklow, helped to take Ballyronan and Leighlinbridge, and was wounded during the unsuccessful storming of Kilkenny. It may have been here that he lost an eye. In 1650 he was appointed to the strategically vital position of governor of Dublin, a post he held until 1656.<br>
<br>A godly Independent and supporter of religious toleration, Hewson joined the radical John Rogers's gathered church in Dublin. Rogers later included in his tract <span class="italic">Ohel or Bethshemesh</span> an account of Hewson's testimony before the congregation, in which he had spoken of how he had lived originally as a &#145;child of wrath&#146; in a &#145;wicked and profane family in London&#146; before being converted through the influence of a godly preacher  (Rogers, 395&#150;6). In 1652 Hewson was recalled to London to discuss the best way to provide godly preachers for Ireland. He strongly supported the policies of Charles Fleetwood as lord deputy, and following the latter's replacement in 1655 by the protector's son Henry he unsuccessfully petitioned for Fleetwood's return. His relationship with Henry Cromwell thereafter remained tense and uneasy and in 1656 he was ordered to return to England.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1653 Hewson was chosen to represent Ireland in Barebone's Parliament. He took an active part in the assembly's work and in December was involved in the moderate members' plan to bring the assembly to an end. On the establishment of the protectorate he reluctantly supported the new constitutional order, but the republican Edmund Ludlow claimed that he was induced to do so only by the payment of his arrears of pay. In lieu of some of these arrears, he was granted land at Luttrellstown near Dublin.<br>
<br>Hewson represented Dublin in the first protectorate parliament in 1654, and Guildford in the second in 1656. In spring 1657 he bitterly opposed the moves in parliament to offer Cromwell the crown. In December 1657 he was knighted by Cromwell and chosen as a member of the new second chamber, where he took his seat in January as Lord Hewson; according to Ludlow the earl of Warwick refused to take his seat in this house because it contained figures of such mean extraction as Hewson. After the resignation of Richard Cromwell, Hewson was chosen by the Rump in July 1659 as commander-in-chief of the foot in Ireland. By the autumn he was back in England and, following John Lambert's closure of parliament, was named to the army committee of safety. In December he was ordered to suppress a demonstration in London in favour of a free parliament, and in the course of the action several demonstrators were killed and about twenty injured. As a result Hewson became a target of a great deal of criticism and was satirized in several ballads and lampoons, including Thomas Flatman's <span class="italic">Don Juan Lamberto</span>, where he appeared as the one-eyed giant, Hussonius, and Edmund Gayton's <span class="italic">Walk Knaves Walk</span>, a mock sermon by his chaplain on how to wax boots. According to Samuel Pepys, in January 1660 a gibbet was erected in Cheapside with Hewson's image nailed to it.<br>
<br>After the Rump's return on 26 December 1659 Hewson was deprived of his command but escaped more serious punishment. In May, as the return of Charles II became increasingly more likely, he fled to the continent. He was exempted from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> but remained at liberty until his death. The Oxford antiquarian Anthony Wood claimed that he died at Amsterdam in 1662, but a pedlar who was arrested and questioned in 1665 on suspicion of being Hewson stated that he had died at Rouen in 1662 or 1663.<br>
