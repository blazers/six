<span class="headword">Wiles,  Maurice Frank</span>  (1923&#150;2005), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born at 24 Dingwall Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 17 October 1923, the third and youngest son of Sir Harold Herbert Wiles (1892&#150;1965), civil servant, and his wife, Stella, daughter of the Revd J. H. Wilkinson of West Grinstead, Wiltshire. His father served as deputy secretary at the Ministry of Labour and National Service from 1946 to 1955, and was knighted KBE in 1947. Wiles was educated at Tonbridge School, then gained an open scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge, to read classics. At school he had participated in the evangelical children's special service camps and the varsities and public schools camps at Iwerne Minster in Dorset. In 1942 he was called up, learning Japanese, and working on military codes at Bletchley Park. He went to Christ's in 1945, changing to read philosophy, despite a conversation with the evangelical leader John Stott, who tried to get him to change his mind. He gained a second-class degree in moral sciences and a first in theology. At Christ's he came under the influence of the chaplain, Ian Ramsey, later bishop of Durham, who had sought to combine theology and linguistic philosophy, and he slowly moved away from his initial enthusiastic conservative evangelicalism. A long-standing friendship with C. F. D. (Charlie) Moule showed him that evangelicalism could be combined with a critical approach to the tradition. Nevertheless he remained thoroughly orthodox, moving to the evangelical theological college, Ridley Hall, in Cambridge to prepare for ordination in the Church of England. He was ordained deacon in 1950, and served a curacy at St George's, Stockport, under Wilfrid Garlick, a well-known broadcaster. On 1 April the same year he married, at All Saints' Church, Lindfield, Sussex, Patricia Margaret (Paddy) Mowll, the 22-year-old daughter of Robert James Mowll, schoolmaster. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>After his curacy Wiles commenced his academic career as chaplain at Ridley Hall from 1952 to 1955. In preparation for a Cambridge prize essay he began his detailed studies of Origen and other patristic thinkers, which led to two important monographs on early Christian hermeneutics, <span class="italic">The Spiritual Gospel: the Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel in the Early Church</span> (1960) and <span class="italic">The Divine Apostle: the Interpretation of St Paul's Epistles in the Early Church</span> (1967). After a period as lecturer in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies at the University College of Ibadan in Nigeria (1955&#150;9), he was appointed dean of Clare College and university lecturer in divinity at Cambridge, succeeding Henry Chadwick, another long-standing friend. Still regarded as wholly orthodox, he was appointed by Geoffrey Fisher, archbishop of Canterbury, as an examining chaplain, a role he continued under Michael Ramsey. At Cambridge he published his first general work and highly regarded text-book, <span class="italic">The Christian Fathers</span> (1966).<br>
<br>Wiles was an ardent enthusiast for cricket, regularly playing for the Oxford diocese as well as the village of Stonor. It was perhaps a sense of fair play, combined with a liberal protestant approach to study, that meant that he was able to approach early Christianity in a way which refused to use the labels of orthodoxy and heresy. By the mid-1960s he was beginning to recognize that serious study of the early church &#145;had turned out to pose much more serious questions to the traditional understanding of the faith than I had previously realised&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scholarship and Faith</span>, 145). As early as 1962 he had published an article entitled &#145;In defence of Arius&#146;, and the following year a highly critical discussion of Cyprian (a saint with many Anglican adherents). He developed a keen interest in the relevance of early Christian doctrine to the post-Enlightenment world, publishing what was probably his most widely read book, <span class="italic">The Making of Christian Doctrine</span>, in 1967. In this he sought to explain patristic theology in its own terms rather than in the light of later tradition: &#145;We ought not &hellip; to begin with any preconceived theory concerning the pattern of doctrinal development. We can only proceed by a patient study of the historical evidence&#146;  (p. 15). In the same year he became professor of Christian doctrine at King's College, London. His inaugural lecture, &#145;Looking into the sun&#146;, and other writings including &#145;Does Christology rest on a mistake?&#146;, both of which were republished in <span class="italic">Working Papers in Doctrine</span> (1976), typified his approach to doctrine, which sought to test commonly held traditions.<br>
<br>In 1970 Wiles was appointed by the crown as regius professor of divinity and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, where again he was able to combine ecclesiastical, pastoral, and preaching duties with the life of an academic. He did not appear hampered by his church position and continued to explore the boundaries of theology, publishing his Hulsean lectures, <span class="italic">The Remaking of Christian Doctrine</span>, in 1974, which noted the &#145;continually changing&#146;  (p. 2) character of doctrine and its restatement in terms acceptable to the modern world. He was appointed as chairman of the Church of England doctrine commission, which produced its controversial report, <span class="italic">Christian Believing</span>, in 1976; this was, he noted, &#145;not an easy report to write&#146;  (p. xi) since its contributors could not reach complete consensus. Afterwards Donald Coggan, archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the commission, removing Wiles as chairman. The following year he was embroiled in the controversy over <span class="italic">The Myth of God Incarnate</span> (edited by John Hick), to which he had contributed an essay calling for the metaphorical reinterpretation of ancient sources. He remained a loyal churchman, who understood the Christian life as &#145;commitment to the struggle to interpret and to live by the confused images that we are enabled to glimpse with the help of what our predecessors have seen&#146;  (&#145;Worship and theology&#146;, in D. W. Hardy and P. H. Sedgwick, eds., <span class="italic">The Weight of Glory</span>, 1991, 77). His introductory lectures became the basis for his widely read textbook, <span class="italic">What is Theology?</span> (1976).<br>
<br>Wiles was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1981, and shortly afterwards produced a small and personal book, <span class="italic">Faith and the Mystery of God</span> (1982), which won the Collins religious book award, and which saw mystery as a warning &#145;against the speciously attractive answers that could dissolve it&#146; and as a way of encouraging &#145;us to continue with the looking, for we can never tell whether we have reached the limits of human understanding&#146;  (p. 129). More philosophical themes were approached in his Bampton lectures at Oxford in 1986, which were published the same year as <span class="italic">God's Action in the World</span>, and which again questioned the established orthodoxy. He was widely in demand as a lecturer, and among others gave the Kellogg lectures at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1977, which provided the basis for much of his collection <span class="italic">Explorations in Theology 4</span> (1979). The breadth of his interests was shown in his judicious Ferguson lectures delivered at Manchester University and published as <span class="italic">Christian Theology and Inter-Religious Dialogue</span> (1992). For much of his time in Oxford he also held the chair of the Oxford patristic conference, and helped to edit a number of its collections.<br>
<br>After retirement in 1991 Wiles continued to edit the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, which he had taken over in 1985, until its centenary in 1999, and was keen to promote the work of younger and less-established scholars. For his seventieth birthday in 1993 he was presented with an affectionately critical Festschrift (<span class="italic">The Making and Remaking of Christian Doctrine</span>, edited by Sarah Coakley and David Pailin). In an active retirement he continued his research into the history of doctrine, publishing a scholarly account of the development of Arianism into modern times in <span class="italic">Archetypal Heresy: Arianism through the Centuries</span> (1996), which was inspired by William Whiston, a predecessor at Clare who was dismissed for maintaining the &#145;Arian heresy&#146; in the eighteenth century. This book adopted Wiles's customary approach to the study of history which sought to &#145;free us from the restrictive shackles that that history is liable to impose upon us&#146;  (p. 186). Three years later, at the suggestion of his wife, he published a popular work of apologetics, <span class="italic">Reason to Believe</span>. His final book, <span class="italic">Scholarship and Faith: a Tale of Two Grandfathers</span> (2003) was a fascinating account of his two clergyman grandfathers, one a Strict and Particular Baptist, and the other an Anglican, which traced the conflicts between academic study and the Christian faith. It also contained a brief autobiographical chapter.<br>
<br>Although he was a naturally shy and private man most at home among his talented family, Wiles was also a gifted teacher and lecturer, as well as a respected and careful supervisor. He was immensely courteous, open-minded, and generous to people of all opinions, and had an unusual diffidence and humility. His theology was often developed in dialogue with friends, which was exemplified by a collection of articles mainly from Festschriften: <span class="italic">A Shared Search: Doing Theology in Conversation with One's Friends</span> (1994). His life work was perhaps best summarized at the end of <span class="italic">Reason to Believe</span>: the &#145;faith by which a Christian lives is fully compatible with a continuing search to understand better what the content of that faith should be&#146;  (p. 119). In his final years he suffered from prostate cancer, from which he died at his home, 11 Bay Tree Close, Iffley, Oxford, on 3 June 2005. He was survived by his wife, Paddy, and their three children. His son Sir Andrew John Wiles (<i>b</i>. 1953), mathematician, was best known for proving Fermat's last theorem.<br>
