<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yoxall, Sir  James Henry</span>  (1857&#150;1925), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 15 July 1857 at Redditch, Worcestershire, the eldest son of Henry Houghton Yoxall, fishing tackle manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Smallwood. At the age of thirteen he left what he called his small, pinched Wesleyan school in Redditch to become a pupil teacher, first at the Wesleyan school in Bridgehouses, Sheffield, then at the Pyebank School under the Sheffield school board. He won a queen's scholarship, and from 1876 to 1878 attended Westminster Training College in London, for which the examining inspector was Matthew Arnold, whose writings long influenced him.<br>
<br>Yoxall returned to Sheffield and was employed by the board first as an assistant master, then from 1887 as headmaster of the Sharrow Lane School, which became famous&#151;even though &#145;payment by results&#146; was still in force&#151;for its academic, artistic, and sporting achievements. He married in 1886 Elizabeth (1858&#150;1925), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel William Coles RE; she had trained at the National School of Cookery, London, and taught domestic subjects at Sheffield schools. They were to have one son and two daughters. As a member of the National Union of Elementary Teachers, Yoxall established his reputation at the Cheltenham conference of 1888 when, with T. J. Macnamara, he organized the so-called &#145;symposium of the indefatigables&#146; to boost membership. He became vice-president, then acting president in 1891, and president and general secretary in 1892. Retaining the latter post, he gave up teaching.<br>
<br>At the Leeds conference of 1892, what had now become the National Union of Teachers (NUT) resolved to advance its aims by sponsoring its leaders as members of parliament. Having unsuccessfully contested Bassetlaw as a Liberal in that year, Yoxall was returned for Nottingham West in 1895, just as he was completing his duties as a member of the Bryce commission on secondary education. Incorporated into the commission's report was his memorandum, based on NUT policy, advocating the reform of both the central and local administration of publicly provided education. The incoming Unionist government created a central ministry (the Board of Education) in 1899; replacing the school boards, set up under <span class="roman">Forster's Act</span> of 1870, proved more difficult. Sir John Gorst's bill of 1896 failed; it also almost split the union. Nevertheless Yoxall and his fellow NUT MPs, Ernest Gray (Unionist) and Macnamara (Liberal) persisted. They encouraged A. J. Balfour to make another attempt and gave him every assistance in refining the successful <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1902 (which invested the administrative counties and county boroughs with educational responsibilities at both elementary and post-elementary levels), winning general approval for their effective participation in the parliamentary process.<br>
<br>Over the next few years Yoxall was closely concerned in monitoring the implementation of the new <span class="roman">Education Act</span> and its counterpart for London, passed in 1903. Against union expectation the Board of Education, under its permanent secretary R. L. Morant, assumed a directive stance, encroaching upon the autonomy of the new local authorities. Resisting Morant's plans for selective post-elementary education, Yoxall referred to the terms in which the consultative committee's report on higher elementary schools (1906) was cast as &#145;snobbish and caddish to the last degree&#146;. He sought instead to secure equal opportunities for children transferring from elementary to secondary schools. Five years later Morant's apparent approval of derogatory comments about elementary school educated local inspectors, expressed in the board's so-called Holmes circular, left, according to Yoxall, a hundred thousand teachers aggrieved that they had been unjustly condemned and held up to ridicule. A mass meeting organized by the NUT hastened the permanent secretary's resignation.<br>
<br>Much of the latter part of Yoxall's career as general secretary of the NUT was taken up with teachers' salaries and pensions. A salaries committee of the union, set up in 1913 to advance the adoption of a national scale, launched a campaign which won support from some 150 local authorities. Suspended as the war began, it was renewed in July 1916 in response to a general rise in wages and supported by strikes. During the second reading of H. A. L. Fisher's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, in March 1918, Yoxall urged the president of the Board of Education to secure salaries, promotions, and pensions for teachers on civil service lines. The existing pension scheme, originally set up with Yoxall's support in 1898, was reorganized on a non-contributory basis by the <span class="roman">Teachers (Superannuation) Act</span> of 1918. In September the following year Fisher established, under the chairmanship of Lord Burnham, the standing joint committee on a provisional minimum scale of salaries for teachers in public elementary schools, with Yoxall (who had resigned his parliamentary seat as the war ended) as joint secretary as well as NUT spokesman. National salary scales were duly agreed (except by some women teachers who now aspired to equal pay) but they were soon under attack from the government which, as the post-war boom ended, strove to amend the new superannuation scheme and to reduce salaries. Yoxall, giving evidence in 1922 to the parliamentary select committee on teachers in grant-aided schools (superannuation) pointed out that teachers had accepted low salary scales on the assumption that the pension question was settled. The government, however, was adamant. The NUT was obliged to accept new superannuation terms and a reduction of 5 per cent in teachers' salaries. Consequently 1923 was a year of strikes. At the Scarborough conference, the following April, Yoxall resigned as general secretary.<br>
<br>Yoxall received honorary MAs from Cambridge (1899) and Oxford (1907) during NUT annual conferences. From June 1909, the year in which he was knighted (he was the first elementary school teacher to receive this honour), until April 1924 he edited <span class="italic">The Schoolmaster</span>, the union's weekly journal. Since his student days, Yoxall had been a prolific writer. Besides magazine articles, he published school textbooks (for example, <span class="italic">The Pupil Teacher's Geography</span>, 1891) and several novels, including <span class="italic">The Romany Stone</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Smalilou</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">Ch&acirc;teau Royal</span> (1908). A keen traveller and collector, he had a developed interest in the decorative arts. In <span class="italic">The Schoolmaster</span> he wrote a regular column entitled &#145;Books and pictures&#146;; <span class="italic">Collecting Old Miniatures</span> and <span class="italic">Collecting Old Glass, English and Irish</span> appeared in 1916. He and his wife settled at Kew, where she was active in local affairs and organizations, including the Social Purity Crusade and the National Suffrage Union. She was a co-opted member of the local education committee, a manager of Darell Road School, and, from 1919, Richmond's first woman magistrate.<br>
<br>Slightly above medium height, well built, with a beard, Yoxall remained to the end of his life an alert, sociable, and sympathetic figure. As Isabel Cleghorn, later first woman president of the NUT, said in 1903: &#145;they all loved Mr Yoxall. He was so tactful, so kindly, so gracious and helpful to anyone who went to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Schoolmaster</span>, 11 April 1903). He died of influenza at his home, Springfield, 20 Kew Gardens Road, Kew, Surrey, on 2 February 1925. Lady Yoxall died on 18 July.<br>
