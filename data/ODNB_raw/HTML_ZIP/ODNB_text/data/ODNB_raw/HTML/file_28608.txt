<span class="headword">Walsh,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [&Eacute;adbhard Breathnach]</span>  (1805&#150;1850), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was born in Londonderry. His parents were natives of Millstreet, West Muskerry, co. Cork. His father had had a smallholding there but was dispossessed after eloping with a young woman, Edward's mother, who was of a higher social standing than he. Walsh senior joined the North Cork militia for want of better employment. He was a sergeant and stationed in Londonderry when Edward was born, returning to his native place some years later.<br>
<br>West Muskerry was almost entirely Irish speaking at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and Edward, who spent many years in the area, had complete mastery of the language. Indeed it is likely that he first learned Irish from his own parents. Muskerry, moreover, had a vigorous Irish scribal and literary tradition and as part of his education in local &#145;hedge schools&#146; Walsh learned to read and write Irish, an ability unusual at the time in much of Ireland. The Irish form of his name was &Eacute;adbhard Breathnach, although most of his later publications appeared under the Anglicized version. Walsh eventually became a schoolmaster and was tutor for a while to the children of a local member of parliament. Walsh took part in anti-tithe agitation, which was widespread in west Cork, and is said to have been imprisoned for a period. He was appointed teacher in the national school in Glantane, near Mallow. Having written an article entitled &#145;What is repeal, Papa?&#146; in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> (founded 1842), he was dismissed from his post.<br>
<br>About this time Walsh began writing English versions of Irish folk tales in the <span class="italic">Dublin Penny Journal</span>. He was next employed as a teacher at Tourin, near Cappoquin, co. Waterford. Here he met Bridget O'Sullivan, daughter of a teacher from Aglish, co. Waterford, whom he married about 1843. They had several children. While at Tourin Walsh contributed original compositions in English and translations of Irish poetry to various magazines. Walsh moved to Dublin about 1843 in the hope of improving his position in life. He was sub-editor for a while on a weekly newspaper called <span class="italic">The Monitor</span>, a post he obtained through the influence of John O'Daly and Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, editor of <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. He was thereafter employed as clerk in the corn exchange, where the work was particularly arduous.<br>
<br>In 1844, in collaboration with John O'Daly, Walsh published <span class="italic">Reliques of Irish Jacobite Poetry</span>, a collection of his own verse translations of eighteenth-century Irish songs together with the Irish texts. A second edition appeared in 1866. In 1847 he published a collection of original works and translations under the title <span class="italic">Irish Popular Songs</span>. A second edition appeared in 1883. Irish folk-songs are noted for their restrained simplicity; Walsh's translations are by comparison precious and effusive. Although interesting as examples of Victorian sentimentality, they are greatly inferior to the Irish originals. His verses were none the less much admired in the nineteenth century, not least because of their overtly nationalist tone.<br>
<br>In 1847 poverty obliged Walsh to accept the post of schoolteacher to the young convicts in the penal settlement of Spike Island in Cork harbour. On 30 May 1848 he obtained a clandestine interview with John Mitchel, the political convict, and was dismissed. Walsh was always of delicate health; Mitchel in his <span class="italic">Jail Journal</span> says of him, &#145;Poor Walsh! He has a family of young children. He seems broken in health and spirits &hellip; There are more contented galley-slaves moiling at Spike than the schoolmaster&#146;  (Mitchel, 12). On 24 August 1848 Walsh was appointed resident teacher to the Cork union workhouse at a salary of &pound;40 per annum. His health deteriorated further and he was compelled to take private lodgings at 13 Prince's Street, where he died on 6 August 1850. Walsh was buried in the Cork Botanical Gardens. A monument was erected to his memory by the trades of Cork city in 1857. His widow and children were befriended by Sir Charles Gavan Duffy and subsequently emigrated to Australia.<br>
