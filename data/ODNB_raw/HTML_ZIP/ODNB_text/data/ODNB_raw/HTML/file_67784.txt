<span class="headword">Roper <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harley; <em>other married name </em>Codrington]</span>,  Primrose</span>  (1908&#150;1978), <span class="occ">painter and gardener</span>, was born on 19 April 1908 at 25 Harley Street, Marylebone, London, the younger daughter of Vaughan Edward Berkeley Harley (1864&#150;1923), a doctor, and his wife, Mary Blagden, of Harley Street and Walton Hall, Bletchley, Buckinghamshire. After the sudden death of her father in May 1923 (when Walton Hall was left to her elder sister, Diana) she became spiritedly independent: having studied at Chelsea School of Art and in Paris, she settled at 5 Seaforth Place, London, where she began to paint professionally. On 21 December 1936 she was married, in the chapel of Wellington Barracks, to Major John Alfred Codrington (1898&#150;<i>c</i>.1990), who had just returned from three years in India. She leased Park House in Onslow Square, London, and they made the garden there together. The marriage was only briefly happy, and she obtained a divorce in 1942 when Codrington left for service abroad. Primrose Codrington volunteered for work as a war artist, designing and painting camouflage with, among others, Basil Spence, painting murals for rescue centres, hospitals, and schools, and&#151;in her spare time&#151;drawing and painting the ruins of bombed city churches: as all this work was unpaid, it is also largely unrecorded. After the war she divided her life between Park House, where she restored her garden with an innovatory use of wild flowers to create the feeling of a country garden, and winters spent in Claviers in Provence. Many commissions for murals were fulfilled, most notably for the British European Airways offices at Dorland House in Lower Regent Street in 1948 (now destroyed). The only surviving mural attributed to her is in the church at Walton, Buckinghamshire, now part of the campus of the Open University.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1952 Primrose Codrington married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46398/', "Lanning Roper (1912&#150;1983)")</script> and they both contributed to the development of Park House and its garden, which was widely illustrated in magazines and newspapers and seen by thousands of garden visitors when it was opened for the National Gardens Scheme. While in England she mainly painted flowers, studies in oil in the manner of R. J. Thornton's <span class="italic">Temple of Flora</span> (which was one of her husband's most treasured possessions), and watercolours of garden vignettes or plants, exhibiting a marvellous control of colour both in the garden and on canvas or paper. In Claviers she painted many landscapes, always with abundant plants, of tremendous variety and with a sure touch, and also still lifes. She was an accomplished draughtswoman, and painting was a constant and vital means of self-expression for her otherwise reserved personality. Her work is mainly of the quality and in the manner of British Romantics such as John Nash and Edward Bawden; indeed, many of her friends were part of their East Anglian artistic community. In appearance she was neat, elegant, and chic; in manner she was efficient and sometimes intimidating, undoubtedly because of her shyness and deep desire for privacy. These last may have been the reason for her separation from Lanning Roper after about ten years, and their eventual divorce in 1968. Her reserve and the possession of private means explains why she rarely (if ever) exhibited her work for sale, and at her death many paintings were distributed among her circle of long-standing and devoted friends. She died of cancer at her home, 44 Cadogan Square, London, on 22 April 1978, and was buried at Walton church. In her will she left substantial donations to the Friends of Hammersmith Hospital, the Sir Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children, the National Art Collections Fund, and other charities.<br>
