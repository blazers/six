<span class="headword">Lattimore,  Owen</span>  (1900&#150;1989), <span class="occ">Mongolist and Sinologist</span>, second son of David Lattimore (1874&#150;1965) and his wife, Margaret Barnes (1873&#150;1958), was born in Sibley Hospital, Washington, DC, on 29 July 1900. His father was a language teacher who accepted a job with the Chinese government teaching English and French in 1901. Owen was raised in Shanghai, Paotingfu (Baodingfu), and Peking (Beijing); the children were educated at home. In 1912 Margaret Lattimore took their five children to Switzerland for formal schooling. Owen was enrolled at the <i>coll&egrave;ge classique cantonal</i> in Lausanne until war broke out in 1914; he was then sent to St Bees School, Cumberland (1914&#150;19), where he flourished although he failed to secure a place at Oxford. Years later, he was glad that he had not attended Oxford. He felt that he would have emerged &#145;an insufferable aesthete&#146; like Evelyn Waugh or Aldous Huxley, or would perhaps have been influenced by one of the extremist ideologies of the day, fascism or Marxism, which would have pre-empted the strong empirical bent that dominated his scholarship.<br>
<br>After returning to China in 1919 Lattimore obtained a job with the British trading firm Arnhold &amp; Co., first in Tientsin (Tianjin), then in Shanghai. He learned Chinese and frequently travelled to the interior, where he learned much about politics, economics, banditry, landlordism, and peasant unrest.<br>
<br>On 4 March 1926 Lattimore married Eleanor (1895&#150;1970), daughter of Dr T. F. Holgate, a Northwestern University dean then living in China. The story of their honeymoon trip through central Asia was told in Owen's <span class="italic">Desert Road to Turkestan</span> (1929) and <span class="italic">High Tartary</span> (1930), and in Eleanor's <span class="italic">Turkestan Reunion</span> (1934). From India they went to Italy, England, and the United States.<br>
<br>From 1928 to 1929 Lattimore studied anthropology at Harvard, after which he obtained grants including the Royal Geographical Society's Cuthbert Peek grant, that enabled him to travel widely in the Chinese areas bordering the USSR between 1929 and 1934. He emerged from this study vigorously hostile toward Japanese aggression, and dedicated to the welfare of the Mongols whose autonomy he espoused for the rest of his life. He also developed the appreciation for the Soviet minority policies in central Asia that later was interpreted by American cold-warriors as pro-communist. The Mongols and other minorities that he studied had kin on the Soviet side of the Sino-Soviet border; &#145;democracy&#146; to them meant the educational and economic opportunities afforded by the USSR, which contrasted strongly with Chinese repression. This was what Lattimore called Russia's &#145;power of attraction&#146; for the central Asian peoples; this was a phrase that, in mid-century America, was held to be pro-communist.<br>
<br>In 1934 Lattimore became editor of <span class="italic">Pacific Affairs</span>, the major journal of the Institute of Pacific Relations, which he edited from a base in China. By 1937 Japanese depredations made it impossible to continue working there. Isaiah Bowman, president of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, offered Lattimore a job lecturing and shortly thereafter as head of the Page School of International Relations at Johns Hopkins.<br>
<br>In 1941 President Roosevelt nominated Lattimore political adviser to Chaing Kai-shek. Lattimore had never met Chiang but thought him the only person with the stature to lead China against the Japanese. In 1942 Lattimore resigned from Chiang's service to direct the Pacific operation of the American office of war information. He was then asked by Roosevelt to accompany Vice-President Henry Wallace's mission to Siberia and China in 1944.<br>
<br>After a short return to Johns Hopkins, Lattimore served on the Pauley reparations mission in Tokyo from December 1945 to January 1946. Back at Johns Hopkins, he organized a programme of Mongol studies and published some 350 articles between 1945 and 1950, many of them scholarly but most popular discussions of world affairs. His first mass-market book, <span class="italic">Solution in Asia</span> (1945), advocated entrepreneurial enterprise freed from European colonial control and endemic corruption as in China. Among many international academic honours he received by this time was the Royal Geographical Society's patron's medal (1942).<br>
<br>But events in China did not go as Lattimore hoped. Instead of promoting political and economic liberalization the nationalist government concentrated on destroying Mao's forces, with the aid of American arms and transport. This did not work; as whole nationalist armies defected with their American equipment to the communists, Lattimore became the most prominent exponent of the heresy that aid to Chiang was throwing good money after bad. And since Mao had won without significant Soviet aid, the people's republic established in 1949 was not a creature of the Kremlin hence not part of a monolithic world communist conspiracy. With the defeat of the American Eighth Army in Korea in 1950, this &#145;Mao was independent&#146; heresy became intolerable in Washington.<br>
<br>In 1950 Senator Joseph McCarthy selected Lattimore not only as the scapegoat on whom to blame the &#145;loss&#146; of China, but as the &#145;top Soviet spy&#146; in the United States, the &#145;boss&#146; of the ring to which Alger Hiss had allegedly belonged. Democratic senator Pat McCarran, a ferocious supporter of Chiang and of Francisco Franco, in 1951 assembled a senate internal security sub-committee of like-minded ultra-conservatives to probe the Institute of Pacific Relations and Lattimore as its former editor. For twelve days in 1951 Lattimore was questioned by McCarran and his sub-committee, the longest interrogation in senate history up to then. He emerged bloody but unbowed; McCarran, on the basis of testimony by former communist witnesses who were known by the FBI to be mendacious, declared him a &#145;conscious, articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Institute of Pacific Relations Report</span>, p. 224) and persuaded the attorney-general to indict him for perjury in December 1952. The FBI was not consulted as to whether this indictment should be sought and indeed their five costly and extensive evaluations concluded that there was no perjury (or any other) case against him. A federal judge threw out most counts of the indictment, but not until June 1955 did Attorney-General Brownell dismiss the case.<br>
<br>Johns Hopkins kept Lattimore on during the inquisition, but the post-indictment years there were a torment to him. He no longer had a public audience, and right-wing professors constantly attacked him. In 1963 the University of Leeds asked him to head a new department of Chinese studies, organizing it as he saw fit. He accepted gladly. At Leeds he was able to incorporate all that he believed necessary to sound scholarship: language, literature, history, economics, geography, anthropology, and sociology. Leeds's willingness to ignore conventional disciplinary boundaries, which had been stultifying at Johns Hopkins, was to Lattimore a <i>summum bonum</i>. He counted the years at Leeds the most satisfying of his life. He acquired a new audience, and his public appearances returned to what had been normal before McCarthy, with the BBC and <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> the most prominent outlets. The Foreign Office asked him to interpret for the queen when the new Mongolian ambassador presented his credentials on 14 November 1963. He gave the Chichele lectures at the University of Oxford in May 1965.<br>
<br>In 1961 the Mongolian people's republic invited Lattimore to visit and he visited Ulan Bator almost every year from then until he was too old to travel, becoming a major force in the small but active world of Mongol scholarship. In 1969 he became the only foreigner to hold full membership of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, an honour that he prized above all others. Even the USSR decided in the 1960s that, capitalist apologist or not, his ideas were worth hearing, and he spent extensive periods in Moscow and Soviet Central Asia. He was invited to lecture and advise at every centre of Asian studies in Europe. As he put it in a letter to the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, the &#145;outrageous Department of Justice indictment became an international passport&#146;  (23 March 1972).<br>
<br>In 1970 Lattimore retired from Leeds but his wife's death the same year deprived him of the support and domestic discipline that had made his earlier writings possible. From 1970 to 1985 he wandered ceaselessly. As professor emeritus at Leeds from 1970 he still visited the department to work with colleagues and students and sporadically to lecture, but his main residence was at Paris (1973&#150;9) and then Cambridge (1979&#150;85) where honorary links to the university and King's College gave some institutional stability in a period otherwise marked by great restlessness.<br>
<br>Many of Lattimore's books became classics, especially <span class="italic">Inner Asian Frontiers of China</span> (1962), but his major claim to fame was the clarity and prescience of his many predictive judgements. What were once heresies, at the turn of the century appear to be perceptive and well informed analyses of the countries of the Far East and central Asia and their relations with the West. To beleaguered American liberals, and perhaps some British people, his most important legacy was proof that it was possible for a single individual to prevail against a powerful committee of the American senate, without knuckling under, confessing imagined sins, or running away.<br>
<br>In 1985 Lattimore moved to Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to be near his only son, David, and six grandchildren. He was frail, but still keen of mind. He died there of pneumonia on 31 May 1989; his ashes were to be scattered on a mountain in Mongolia.<br>
