<span class="headword">West <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Iliffe]</span>,  Jane</span>  (1758&#150;1852), <span class="occ">writer and poet</span>, was born on 30 April 1758 in a building which afterwards became St Paul's Coffee House, London, the only child of Jane and John Iliffe. Her parents moved with her when she was eleven to Desborough in Northamptonshire. A useful source for West's early life is her letter of 1800 seeking Bishop Percy's patronage in order to support her &#145;rising family&#146; which is reprinted along with other biographical and literary information in her obituary  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 38.99&#150;101). West states that she was &#145;self-instructed&#146; and began writing poetry at the age of thirteen, having by the age of twenty a &#145;formidable&#146; catalogue of compositions: &#145;I scorned corrections, and never blotted&#146;  (ibid., 99). By 1783 she had married Thomas West (<i>d</i>. 1823), a yeoman farmer from neighbouring Little Bowden, Leicestershire, members of whose family had been rectors of the parish for a century and a half. Thomas West was related to Vice-Admiral Temple West and to Gilbert West, a minor poet. They had three sons: Thomas (1783&#150;1843), John (1787&#150;1841), and Edward (1794&#150;1821). Jane West was to outlive them all  (Lloyd). In 1810 she paid a visit to Bishop Percy at Dromore in Ireland. After Percy's death, she continued to write but her popularity seems to have suffered from the loss of her patron and of influential subscribers. West was also a correspondent of Sarah Trimmer, the educational and children's writer.<br>
<br>All of West's works are didactic and conservative in their ethical judgements regarding political change and women's role in society. Her first novel, <span class="italic">The Advantages of Education</span> (1793), written under the pseudonym Prudentia Homespun, aims &#145;to enstruct rather than entertain&#146;  (preface). This was followed by what is now her best-known novel, <span class="italic">A Gossip's Story</span> (1796), also published under the facetious pseudonym, and written to expound &#145;The Advantages of Consistency, Fortitude and Domestic Virtue&#146;. Critics have noted how <span class="italic">A Gossip's Story</span> with its anti-sentimental plot line anticipates the themes and judgements of Jane Austen's fiction, particularly the latter's <span class="italic">Sense and Sensibility</span>. Her third novel, <span class="italic">A Tale of the Times</span> (1799), addresses her familiar theme of the necessity for young women to make the right marriage choice, but expands on this with its expression of anxieties of the day, particularly fears of revolutionary upheaval. In its anti-Jacobin, tory, and reactionary emphasis <span class="italic">A Tale of the Times</span> forms a counterpoint to the Jacobin novels of the period.<br>
<br>West's other novels include <span class="italic">The Infidel Father</span> (1802) which attacks atheism; <span class="italic">The Refusal</span> (1810); <span class="italic">The Loyalists: an Historical Novel</span> (1812), credited as a possible influence on Walter Scott's first novel <span class="italic">Waverley</span>; and <span class="italic">Alicia de Lacy: an Historical Romance</span> (4 vols., 1814). <span class="italic">Ringrove, or, Old Fashioned Notions</span> (1827), her last novel, written when West was sixty-nine, broke a silence of over ten years. Pamela Lloyd has also identified a children's story, <span class="italic">The Sorrows of Selfishness</span> by Prudentia Homespun, as the work of West.<br>
<br>West's conservative views on woman's role are particularly strident in her popular conduct literature: <span class="italic">Letters to a Young Man</span> (1801), written to her son and dedicated to Percy, went through six editions by 1818. This was followed by <span class="italic">Letters to a Young Lady</span> (1806), which was dedicated to Queen Charlotte and addressed to Miss Maunsell, who died in 1808. In many respects <span class="italic">Letters to a Young Lady</span> forms an ideological counterpart to Mary Wollstonecraft's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span> (1792). Where Wollstonecraft advocates &#145;Rights&#146;, West insists on &#145;Duties&#146;. However both, as feminist critics have pointed out, were involved in the debate on the &#145;Woman's question&#146; and foregrounded the necessity of improved education for women, although not for the same ends.<br>
<br>Jane West wrote poetry from a young age, much of it in a didactic vein. Roger Lonsdale, editor of <span class="italic">Eighteenth Century Women's Poetry</span> (1990), considers her best poetry to be that written in a familiar manner rather than her more polished, consciously literary verse. Her poetic works include <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poetry, Written at an Early Period of Life</span> (1786), her least interesting collection; <span class="italic">The Humours of Brighthelmstone: a Poem</span> (1788); <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems and a Tragedy</span> [&#145;Edmund&#146;] (1791); <span class="italic">An Elegy on the Death of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke</span> (1797); <span class="italic">Poems and Plays</span> (vols. 1 and 2, 1799; 3 and 4, 1805); and <span class="italic">The Mother: a Poem in Five Books</span> (1799). <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems, Translations and Imitations</span> (1780), previously attributed to her, is now known to be the work of Benjamin West. West's poems also appeared in journals and anthologies of the day. She also wrote <span class="italic">Select Translations of the Beauties of Massillon</span> (1812) and <span class="italic">Scriptural Essays Adapted to the Holy Days of the Church of England</span> (2 vols., 1816). West's dramatic works have now been largely forgotten. A contemporary commentator attributes her lack of dramatic success to the vogue for German sentimental drama  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 69.1129). West was herself a contributor for many years to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>West's reputation in her own day was for the clear didacticism of her texts. It was reported that Queen Charlotte purchased her novels, and Bishop Percy, who had praised West's writing and character in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> (1801), complained of his delay in obtaining a copy of <span class="italic">A Tale of the Times</span> from the circulating libraries at Brighton owing to its popularity. Her works were recommended for &#145;their pure morality, and forcible arguments&#146;, and her character described as &#145;a model of imitation&#146; in her roles as &#145;a wife, a mother, and a daughter&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 69.1128). Her obituarist took great pains to dispel any inference of lowly status associated with the author insisting that her &#145;gentlewoman&#146; status was concurrent with her literary accomplishments  (ibid., 1st ser., 72.99). Little is known of West's actual social status during her lifetime, although Pamela Lloyd has uncovered her will and other papers which reveal that West, as sole beneficiary of her parents, inherited in 1805 property which, when sold in 1812, produced &pound;3000. West's descriptions of herself reinforce a linking of domesticity and morality with female literary authority: she insists that &#145;My needle always claims the preeminence of my pen. I hate the name &#147;rhyming slattern&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 72.99). However later critics (Lonsdale, 1990, Shattock, 1993) have pointed out that West was not above self-promotion and exploiting the media of the day; about 1800 there seems to have been a conscious campaign to obtain a wider audience for her.<br>
<br>West's life and writing career were long but towards the end of her life she felt herself to be out of kilter with the times. This sense of isolation was increased by her failing sight. She describes herself as &#145;an old Q. in the corner whom the rest of the world has forgotten&#146;  (Lloyd, 470). West died on 25 March 1852 at Little Bowden aged ninety four, having lived most of her adult life there, in a &#145;retired situation with few connections&#146;, as she described her circumstances, and never achieving the wider literary fame that she courted. She was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Little Bowden. Her estate was divided among her six grandchildren; her manuscripts and letters were originally left to her grandson the Revd Edward West, but these have not been traced.<br>
