<span class="headword">Pilkington,  Matthew</span>  (1701&#150;1774), <span class="occ">satirist and art historian</span>, was born in Ballyboy, King's county, the son of William Pilkington, a watchmaker. The father moved to Dublin in time for the boy's schooling, acquired rental properties in the eastern suburbs, and eventually (according to Laetitia Pilkington) turned alehouse keeper. Admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1718, the son was elected scholar in 1721, graduated BA in 1722, and the following March was irregularly ordained deacon by the high tory bishop of Ossory, Sir Thomas Vesey. By 25 May 1725, when he qualified for his MA at Trinity, Pilkington was serving as reader at St Andrew's, Dublin, and courting Laetitia (<i>c</i>.1709&#150;1750) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22270/', "Pilkington, Laetitia")</script>], the daughter of a prominent parishioner, Dr John Van Lewen, to whom he had laid claim that spring as his beloved &#145;Laetitia&#146; in his earliest published poem, <span class="italic">A Pastoral Elegy on the Death of a Lady's Canary-Bird</span>. On 31 May the couple were hurriedly married, and on 17 November, with Van Lewen's help, Pilkington was promoted to curate at St Andrew's. Through his immediate literary patron, Patrick Delany, Pilkington next came to the attention of Jonathan Swift&#151;probably late in 1728, when he produced the official royal birthday <span class="italic">Ode</span> for Dublin Castle. (Swift spoofed it in his <span class="italic">Directions for a Birth-Day Song</span> but then apparently helped Pilkington to revise it for a repeat performance in 1729.) With the backing of Swift, Delany, and another early patron, the poet Mary Barber, he next collected and published his <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (Dublin, 1730; expanded edition, London, 1731). Again through Swift's sponsorship, he travelled to London in September 1732 as chaplain to the incoming lord mayor, the Jacobite printer John Barber (no relation to Mary Barber), whose opposition to the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> increasingly alarmed the Walpole government. In London, Pilkington promptly alienated Barber and Swift's other friends, paid court to the prime minister's libertine son Edward Walpole, and took up with the actress Mary Heron. In the months before his appointment, seemingly with Swift's assent, he had unsuccessfully tried to broker a collected London edition of Swift's works, while palming off as Swift's his own <span class="italic">Infallible Scheme to Pay the Publick Debt of this Nation in Six Months</span> (London, 1732, &#145;By D&#151;n S&#151;t&#146;). Once in London he found publishers for some new satiric verse which Swift sent over with Mary Barber, while passing off as Swift's another of his own satires, <span class="italic">A Serious and Useful Scheme to Make an Hospital for Incurables of Universal Benefit</span> (London, 1733, &#145;By a Celebrated Author in Ireland&#146;). When the government took action against one of the new Swift poems, <span class="italic">An Epistle to a Lady</span>, both Pilkington and Mrs Barber were arrested in January 1734. The speed of his release and return to Ireland&#151;within three months, compared to a year and a half for Mrs Barber&#151;convinced contemporaries that he had turned informer. Almost certainly it was John Barber rather than Swift whom he informed on, but as his wife later remarked, &#145;The Notion of his having betray'd Dr. Swift incens'd the whole Kingdom of Ireland against him&#146;  (L. Pilkington, 68). Thereafter Pilkington kept a lower public profile, quietly cultivating successive pro-Walpole archbishops of Dublin, John Hoadly and Charles Cobbe. From the latter, in 1741, he received the living of Donabate, co. Dublin, adjacent to Cobbe's country seat at Newbridge House. Meanwhile the death of Pilkington's father-in-law in January 1737&#151;leaving debts instead of the large fortune anticipated&#151;effectively ended his marriage to Laetitia. After unsuccessfully forcing her on a male friend&#151;or so she claimed&#151;he finally caught her in a sufficiently compromising position to effect a separation, in September 1737, and an ecclesiastical divorce, granted in February 1738. At the same time, by her account, he was romantically involved with the rotund but wealthy &#145;Widow Warren&#146; (probably Mary Warren, widow of a Kildare MP), and was spending time with the stage-struck painter James Worsdale&#151;implicated that season in the formation of the Dublin Hellfire Club but protected through the influence of their mutual friend Edward Walpole, then in town as the lord lieutenant's chief secretary. For its Dublin production that January, Pilkington reportedly revamped the text of Worsdale's racy ballad opera <span class="italic">A Cure for a Scold</span> (Dublin, 1738).<br>
<br>Publication of these charges in Laetitia's first volume of <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (February 1748) ended any hopes that Pilkington might climb higher in the Church of Ireland. In a series of anonymous broadside retorts that year, he called her a whore and a liar, hinted that five of their six children were bastards, and threatened a counter-narrative to expose her. Nothing of the sort ever appeared. By this time, as Laetitia remarked in her third volume, Pilkington had largely given up literature for what sounds like secretarial work: &#145;I fancy when thy <i>Pen-using</i> Talents perish'd, thy <i>Pen-making</i> ones shot forth&#146;, in welcome service to &#145;a certain Bishop&#146;, Charles Cobbe  (L. Pilkington, 300). At some point after his divorce Pilkington also took up the study of old master paintings. In Beaumont Brenan's satiric farce about Dublin art auctions, <span class="italic">The Painter's Breakfast</span> (performed at Smock Alley, 2 April 1756), he appears as the Revd Mr Busy, a local expert and buying agent so devious that no one believes him even when he speaks truth. About the same time, as an adviser and buying agent, he began helping Cobbe's son Thomas in building up the family's notable collection of paintings at Newbridge House. Eventually, in 1770, he published his influential <span class="italic">The Gentleman's and Connoisseur's Dictionary of Painters</span>, a 723-page biographical and critical compendium which ranks as the first original treatment of the subject in English, giving special attention to the Italians (who were then at the height of fashion), to the Dutch and Flemish (who were not), and to the contemporary art market in both the British Isles and the Low Countries. Periodically expanded, revised, and retitled (as <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Painters</span> in Henry Fuseli's 1805 and 1810 editions, <span class="italic">A General Dictionary of Painters</span> after 1824) this held its own for nearly a century, the last edition appearing in 1857. On a moderate salary&#151;&#145;about &pound;150&#146; a year by 1772, according to diocesan records&#151;Pilkington also managed to acquire a few nice pieces for himself, including a Camphuysen landscape, a Heemskerk conversation piece, six Baptiste watercolours, and the sketch of a Tintoretto in Venice, &#145;reputed to be the original sketch&#146;, formerly in the ducal collection at Kilkenny  (M. Pilkington, <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, 112, 283, 36, 614).<br>
<br>By the end of 1740, before his two younger surviving children escaped his custody and rejoined their mother in London, Pilkington had dropped the Widow Warren and taken up with Nancy Sandes, daughter of a minor landowner in Queen's county. He married her on 27 August 1750, less than a month after Laetitia's death. They had two children, neither of whom survived infancy. Pilkington died in Cumberland Street, Dublin on 18 July 1774, Nancy living on until 1785.<br>
<br>Thanks to his penchant for anonymity and intrigue, Pilkington's full literary output has yet to be traced. When his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Painters</span> first appeared, he told his publisher that he had on hand an extensive unpublished account, or &#145;Character&#146;, of the artist William Hogarth, too long and too sensitive politically to include in the dictionary. For the earlier period, his wife Laetitia indicates that he wrote at least one of the mock-heroic poems satirizing the Trinity College censor Hugh Graffan assembled in <span class="italic">Graffanio-mastix, or, A Collection of Curious Poems on the Censor</span> (1730), as well as the libellous prose portrait of his former employer, John Barber, eventually published by Edmund Curll in <span class="italic">An impartial history of the life, character, amours, travels, and transactions of Mr John Barber, City printer</span> (1741).<br>
<br>Pilkington is a leading suspect in two celebrated literary forgeries from the 1730s: the counterfeit letter from Swift to Queen Caroline in ostensible praise of Mary Barber, of 22 June 1731, which effectively cut her off from royal patronage; and the ludicrous James Thomson pastiche in (dis)praise of a poetic rival of Pilkington's, James Dalacourt (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, November 1734), which poor Dalacourt continued to reprint as genuine even after Thomson publicly disclaimed it. Pilkington's ability to hold a grudge is independently attested by the <span class="italic">Impartial History</span>, where he falsifies his story of meeting Swift in order to deny any credit to his original patrons, Delany and Mary Barber, whom he suspected of blocking his advancement  (pp. 26&#150;8), and by his last will, dated 14 February 1754. There the son who tried to stay neutral in his war with Laetitia (&#145;never felt a filial affection for me&#146;) is cut off with &pound;5. To &#145;those abandoned wretches&#146; Jack and Betty Pilkington&#151;his two other surviving children by Laetitia, not acknowledged as such in the will&#151;he leaves a shilling apiece, though &#145;I should abhorr to mention them in any Deed of mine, if it were not to prevent all possibility of Dispute or litigation&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 11 ser., 6.66).<br>
