<span class="headword">Stuart, Lord  Bernard</span>, styled earl of Lichfield  (1622&#150;1645), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was born on 28 December 1622, the youngest of ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67529/', "Esm&#233; Stuart, third duke of Lennox (1579?&#150;1624)")</script>, and his wife, Katherine (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1637), only daughter and heir of Gervase Clifton, Lord Clifton of Leighton Bromswold, Huntingdonshire. After her father's death in 1618 Stuart's mother became Baroness Clifton in her own right. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26707/', "James Stuart, fourth duke of Lennox and first duke of Richmond")</script>, was his eldest brother.<br>
<br>Stuart was brought up under the direction of appointees of the king, with distinct revenue assigned for his maintenance. He was created MA at Cambridge University in 1637. On 30 January 1639 he obtained a licence to travel abroad for three years with his elder brother John. It was probably before they went abroad that Van Dyck painted a double portrait of the brothers, a painting greatly admired by Thomas Gainsborough who came across it in 1785. He produced a full-scale copy of the work and a head-and-shoulders study of Lord Bernard.<br>
<br>Stuart was knighted at York on 18 April 1642 by his kinsman Charles I. On the outbreak of the civil war he was appointed captain of the King's Own life guards. This troop attracted so many &#145;persons of honour and quality&#146; and was so dazzlingly equipped that it was known as the &#145;show troop&#146;. It formed, Clarendon recorded:<blockquote>so gallant a body, that upon a very modest computation the estate and revenue of that single troop might justly be valued at least equal to all theirs who then voted in both Houses under the name of the Lords and Commons of Parliament, and so made and maintained that war. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.348)</blockquote>Stuart and the king's life guard of cavalry were given permission to serve in the front rank of Prince Rupert's cavalry at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. Stuart himself left a brief account of the battle  (Davies, 38&#150;9), in which his brother George Stuart, Lord D'Aubigny, was killed. Stuart was with Rupert when he retook Lichfield on 20 April 1643. Stuart fought at the battle of Newbury on 19&#150;20 September 1643. On 29 June 1644, at the head of the life guards, he supported Thomas Wentworth, earl of Cleveland, in his charge against Sir William Waller's parliamentarian troops at Cropredy Bridge, Oxfordshire. He was among the last to remain at Charles I's side at the devastating defeat at Naseby on 14 June 1645, while they vainly attempted to &#145;prevail with those shattered and frightened troops either to give or stand one charge more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 2.386&#150;7). In July Stuart attended the king at Raglan Castle where the marquess of Worcester ensured that they gained a brief respite from the war.<br>
<br>Before Naseby the king had designated Stuart as Baron Stuart of Newbury and earl of Lichfield, but the money to pay the necessary fees had been lost in the battle and its aftermath. Sir Edward Nicholas consequently wrote to the king recommending him to command the patent to pass the seals without any fee being paid. Before this could be done, however, Stuart fell in battle. He accompanied the king on his march to relieve Chester, and entered the town with the king on 23 September. While most of the cavalry quartered 3 miles from the city the king's life guard and Lord Gerard's troops remained with Charles. The next day, while Sir Marmaduke Langdale engaged the parliamentarian forces on Rowton Heath, Stuart led a sally out of the city. For a time he was successful, but he was eventually driven back. Although there were few casualties in the rout that followed, Stuart himself was killed, in view of the town and the king, &#145;who from one of the towers of the wall, saw his troops defeated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Henry Slingsby</span>, 66).<br>
<br>Stuart's death was &#145;such a loss&#146;, Lord Digby told the marquess of Ormond, &#145;as a victory would scarce repair&#146;  (Carte, 1.92&#150;3). &#145;He was&#146;, Clarendon wrote, &#145;a very faultless young man, of a most gentle, courteous, and affable nature, and of a spirit and courage invincible; whose loss all men exceedingly lamented, and the King bore it with extraordinary grief&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.115&#150;16). The royalist memorialist claimed that Stuart said of the hazards of war, &#145;That a small courage might serve a man to engage for that cause; the ruine whereof no courage would serve him to survive&#146;  (Lloyd, 329).<br>
<br>Stuart died unmarried. Richard Johnson, his master of horse, obtained a licence from parliament to bury his lord in October. He was buried with his fallen brothers, George and John (who had been mortally wounded at the battle of Cheriton on 29 March 1644) in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, where the date is recorded (possibly wrongly) as 11 March 1646.<br>
