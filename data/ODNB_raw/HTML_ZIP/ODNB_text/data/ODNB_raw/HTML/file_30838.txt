<span class="headword">Bowen,  Edmund John</span>  (1898&#150;1980), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in Worcester on 29 April 1898, the eldest in the family of two sons and two daughters of Edmund Riley Bowen (<i>b</i>. 1866), headmaster of St John's Elementary School for Boys, Worcester, and his wife, Lilias, daughter of Thomas Kamester, carpenter, of Clewer, Windsor. He was educated at his father's school and at the Royal Grammar School, Worcester. Bowen won a science scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, and went into residence in October 1915. In 1916 he volunteered and in April 1917 was posted to France with the Royal Garrison Artillery.<br>
<br>Following demobilization Ted Bowen returned to Oxford in January 1919 and took first-class honours in chemistry in 1920 after only five terms of study. He was one of several highly gifted scientists whose abilities were recognized by their tutor, H. B. Hartley, for whom he and his contemporary C. N. Hinshelwood carried out undergraduate research. Immediately after graduation he was appointed a demonstrator in the Balliol and Trinity laboratories. This was followed by a lectureship (1921) and a fellowship (1922) at University College which he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1924 Bowen married Edith, eldest daughter of Joseph and Margaret Moule, farmers of Hartlebury, Worcestershire. They had a happy marriage, and two children were born, Margaret Lilias (<i>b</i>. 1927) and Humphry John (<i>b</i>. 1929). From 1938 onwards he was also university lecturer and later Aldrichian praelector. Bowen sat on numerous university committees, but his main contributions to university administration were in connection with the University Museum, the Museum of the History of Science, and the university observatory.<br>
<br>Bowen's scientific work lay almost entirely in the field of photochemistry and the related phenomenon of fluorescence. His pioneer work in the period 1923&#150;35 provided some of the earliest experimental confirmation of the fundamental laws of photochemistry in the theoretical work of Einstein. In 1935 Bowen was elected FRS, and later served on the council (1943&#150;5). During the Second World War he was a member of the Oxford research team working on respirator problems for the Ministry of Supply.<br>
<br>Bowen's early research had been carried out using largely home-made apparatus, often put together using domestic odds and ends. However, from 1945, electrical and optical devices became commercially available, and Bowen used these extensively in his later work on fluorescence. One of the notable results of this work was the demonstration that energy could be transferred from one molecule to another over distances much greater than a molecular diameter. Although no mathematician, he took a keen interest in the developments in quantum theory, which were of basic importance for his experimental work.<br>
<br>Bowen had a remarkable gift for explaining abstruse theories by means of simple diagrams and models. This was put to good use in his book <span class="italic">The Chemical Aspects of Light</span> (1941) and in discussion with pupils and colleagues. He was widely read in many branches of science outside chemistry, and an avid collector of fossils and antiquities. One ammonite from Dorset, where he had a holiday house, was named <i>Perisphinctes boweni</i> after him. He was keenly interested in the history of science, and published several articles on the early history of the Royal Society and of science in Oxford. In 1963 Bowen was awarded the Davy medal of the Royal Society. He also became vice-president of the Chemical Society and of the Faraday Society and was Liversidge lecturer of the Chemical Society in 1966.<br>
<br>Bowen was an inventive scientist, more interested in understanding underlying principles than in accumulation of detail. His enthusiasm and kindness to others were widely acknowledged. He retained his boyish character and youthful appearance until his death at his home, 10 Park Town, Oxford, on 19 November 1980 following a heart attack.<br>
