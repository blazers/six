<span class="headword">Faber,  Albert Otto</span>  (1612&#150;1684), <span class="occ">chemical physician</span>, was born in L&uuml;beck, north Germany, the son of Gallus (or Walter) Faber, a government official. He was educated at the University of Marburg, where he studied jurisprudence and gained a doctorate. Thereafter he practised medicine, at first in L&uuml;beck; he moved to Hamburg in 1641, and later became the personal physician and army physician to the prince of Sultzbach. He then served the king of Denmark in the same capacities and afterwards the king of Sweden; as late as 1663 he continued to refer to himself as &#145;Royal physician to the Swedish Army&#146;  (Faber, <span class="italic">A Relation of some Notable Cures</span>, 4).<br>
<br>Faber moved to England in early 1661, supposedly at the invitation of Charles II, who gave him &pound;50 on 13 August 1661 &#145;in respect of services and necessities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Treasury Books, 1660&#150;67</span>, 276). He was befriended by Samuel Hartlib, who called him an &#145;excellent Helmontian physician&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence of Dr John Worthington</span>, 363). By 1662 he was settled in Thames Street, at the bottom of Addle Hill, London, with his wife, Claude, with whom he had two children, Gertrude and Albert Otto.<br>
<br>Faber's first book, <span class="italic">Paradoxon de morbo gallico</span> (1662), was a curious treatise on syphilis, which traced the origin of the disease to the fall of man, condemned the widespread use of mercury as a cure, and presented his own cure in the disguise of an extravagant metaphorical parable written in a form similar to contemporaneous alchemical allegories. The book was first printed in German (Altona, 1660) and later in English (1662). In 1663 Faber published a four-page <span class="italic">Relation of some Notable Cures</span>, which, like all his subsequent medical publications, was a privately printed pamphlet advertising remedies he was offering for sale. In April 1666 he acted as a witness to the cures of Valentine Greatrakes, the Stroker, who claimed to cure by his touch.<br>
<br>Shortly after his arrival in England, Faber began an association with the Quakers, possibly at the instigation of his wife and possibly as a &#145;commercial expediency&#146; to obtain a network through which to vend medicines  (Sampson, 484&#150;6). He translated two pamphlets from German, published as <span class="italic">The Twelve Visions of Stephen Melish</span> (1663) and <span class="italic">England's Warning</span> (1664), containing prophecies popular in Quaker circles. At a Quaker meeting on 14 August 1664 he was arrested pursuant to the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, fined &pound;5, and imprisoned at Newgate for three months. From prison he wrote <span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span> (1664), in which he argued that the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> did not extend to foreigners such as himself. Faber, described by the lord mayor and lord chancellor as &#145;a very suspected person, reather of crafty principalls &amp; soe a maker of Quakers&#146;  (Penney, 215), was ordered to leave the country. He did not do so and later claimed that he could not obtain a passport. In November 1666 he, his servant, and two Quakers were arrested in Banbury on suspicion of arson. While his co-defendants were quickly acquitted, Faber was sent to Oxford gaol. In a letter to the king dated 30 April 1667, he repudiated Quakerism, stating that he was merely curious about it and claiming regular attendance at the French protestant church of London. He was freed in August and deported (without his wife) to Flanders on 22 August.<br>
<br>In requesting a pass to return to England in 1672, Faber admitted entering England illegally at least once in order to tend to his wife, who was ill. This visit probably occurred in the spring of 1668, during which time his pamphlet <span class="italic">Some Kindling Sparks in Matters of Physick</span> was published privately in London. He was granted leave to enter the country on 22 April 1672, and took up residence in London near the Old Palace Yard, Westminster. In 1673&#150;4, he corresponded on medical matters with the Galenist physician John Twisden. Copies of their correspondence seem to have been privately circulated: a copy is extant among Isaac Newton's papers.<br>
<br>In 1677 Faber published <span class="italic">De auro potabili medicinali</span>, on the title page of which he referred to himself as the king's physician-in-ordinary. This brief work described the use and effects of his version of &#145;potable gold&#146;, an esteemed preparation of chemical medicine purportedly made from gold and popularized in the early seventeenth century by one Francis Anthony. Faber's tract compared the successes of his own &#145;cordial&#146; with those of Anthony, and detailed Faber's administration of the cordial to Sheldon, then archbishop of Canterbury. Faber died on 15 August 1684, in London, and was buried there in St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, where in 1685 his daughter, Gertrude, had a marble monument raised to his memory.<br>
