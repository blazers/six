<span class="headword">Chisholm,  Mairi Lambert Gooden, of Chisholm</span>  (1896&#150;1981), <span class="occ">ambulance driver and first aider</span>, was one of the two &#145;women of Pervyse&#146;. Born on 26 February 1896 in Datchet, Buckinghamshire, she was the second child and elder daughter of Roderick Chisholm (<i>b</i>. 1864), chief of clan Chisholm, and his wife, Margaret Fraser, daughter of Colonel William Fraser of Colbokie and Guisachan. Privately educated, she spent her girlhood in Hampshire and Dorset, developing a lifelong interest in the new technology of motor vehicles. Encouraged by her father's gift of a motorcycle, she took part in trials and rallies in the south of England, where she encountered the redoubtable Mrs Elsie Knocker [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67675/', "T'Serclaes, Baroness Elizabeth Blackall de")</script>]. Mairi, eighteen in 1914, slender and attractive with brown hair and blue eyes in an oval face, was eleven years younger than Elsie Knocker but no less robust in character. When war was declared in August 1914 both headed immediately for London&#151;with motorcycles&#151;to volunteer their services for the war effort. Unsurprisingly Mairi's mother felt that this was most unsuitable for her young daughter and refused her even a suitcase. Her father was more supportive and Mairi, showing the boldness that would characterize her work at Pervyse, wrapped her belongings in a bandanna on the back of her bike and set off regardless.<br>
<br>Once in London, Mairi volunteered as a dispatch rider for the Women's Emergency Corps (founded by the Women's Social and Political Union). Here she was noticed by Hector Munro, Scottish doctor and founder of the volunteer Flying Ambulance Column (FAC). Mairi's motoring skills recommended her, and on 25 September 1914 the FAC left for the war zone in Belgium. Unlike the British military authorities the Belgians gratefully accepted the services of the FAC and for the first few weeks on the Yser front they collected casualties to transport back to base hospitals. Mairi Chisholm, with characteristic understatement, recalled one incident of Belgian and German hand-to-hand bayonet fighting as &#145;a particularly unpleasant little battle&#146;  (&#145;Mairi Chisholm&#146;, <span class="italic">Yesterday's Witness</span>). At this early stage of the war Mairi and Elsie Knocker were sometimes allowed by the enemy to crawl out into no man's land and retrieve the bodies of English airmen.<br>
<br>Mairi encouraged Elsie Knocker when, unhappy with Munro's leadership but not unwilling to accept his support, she persuaded the Belgian authorities to allow the two women to set up a first aid post actually on the front line between Nieuport and Ypres at Pervyse. First a cellar, then half a bombed-out house, it was 3 miles ahead of any other ambulance posts. Mairi Chisholm later wrote:<blockquote>Apart from the steady stream of wounded day and night (we slept in our clothes) we had a surgery. Many of the men in the trenches suffered from boils, sores, foot troubles &amp;c. VD was prevalent and unattended to in the early stages of the war&#151;all these cases came to the dugout for our attention. (Chisholm)</blockquote>With a Wolseley ambulance, donated by the people of Sutton Coldfield, Mairi would nightly undertake the terrible drive with the wounded from the front line at Pervyse to base hospital; between 1915 and 1917 she carried 1500 casualties. The only women permitted to work at the front line on the entire western front, Mairi and Elsie's importance was recognized by the appointment of each as chevalier of the order of Leopold on 31 January 1915 with a later investiture by King Albert of the Belgians himself. By 1917 their fame was acknowledged in Britain too&#151;encouraged by the fund-raising they had perforce to do on brief home-leave trips, which Elsie Knocker enjoyed but Mairi cared for less. On 10 October 1917 both women were awarded the Military Medal. On 17 March 1918 they were caught in a gas attack and had to be invalided home. Mairi returned to Pervyse alone for a brief spell but was gassed a second time while on the field telephone. She was twenty-two years old.<br>
<br>Mairi continued her interest in motor vehicles, working for a time, immediately after 1918, in the London motor trade and, later, driving a Sunbeam sports car well into her eighties. She took an interest in the Chisholm family history and, with her nephew the clan chief, established the Clan Chisholm Society in 1952. But Mairi's health had been adversely affected by the war. She left London about 1921 and soon moved to Cantray, a highland estate, where she stayed to run a poultry farm with her lifelong friend May Davidson. From the 1930s they lived with a group of women friends in Connal, Argyll, until Mairi's death on 22 August 1981 at Perth Hospital. She was cremated at Perth crematorium on 26 August.<br>
<br>After the war, in 1918, the two &#145;women of Pervyse&#146; had gone their separate ways. Unlike Elsie Knocker, Mairi never published but, following her inclusion in the 1977 Imperial War Museum exhibition &#145;Women at war, 1914&#150;18&#146; and the BBC television series <span class="italic">Yesterday's Witness</span>, she left her diaries and a brief memoir to the museum. In the latter she refers generously to the work of Elsie Knocker and concludes:<blockquote>Unlike her I have found much happiness and sense of purpose in peace time. I have been blessed with friendships of both men and women, and although my health has not always been good it has never justified self-pity. What more can one say?</blockquote>
