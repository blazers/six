<span class="headword">Evans <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Canual or Canval]</span>,  Katharine</span>  (<em>c.</em>1618&#150;1692), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, declared to the Maltese inquisition in 1658 that she was the daughter of Anne and Roger &#145;Canual&#146; and that she was then aged about forty; this was an Italian rendering of her maiden name, which may have been Canval. At an unknown date she married John Evans (<i>d</i>. in or after 1690), a yeoman. Before her conversion to Quakerism, she was a member of the Church of England, then a Baptist, and eventually an Independent. Presumably the Evans family converted to Quakerism in the summer of 1654 together with Thomas Murford, who was arrested in 1655 because he disturbed a minister in Bath Abbey and whose wife, Jane, was probably John Evans's sister.<br>
<br>Possibly between the end of 1655 and the beginning of 1656 Katharine Evans went to the Isle of Man. She was banished from the island, and probably shortly thereafter went to Ireland. There she was interviewed by Henry Cromwell and was placed under arrest for four days. At the end of May 1657 she was arrested and publicly whipped in the market square of Salisbury. Shortly after this, together with Murford, she returned to the Isle of Wight. Afterwards she preached in Portsmouth, Salisbury, and Warminster and in all these places was received with fiery abuse. In the winter of 1657 Evans felt inspired to go to Alexandria and during 1658 went twice to London to organize her journey. In London she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64776/', "Sarah Cheevers")</script> who, independently, had felt the same inspiration. They set out for the Mediterranean in the autumn of 1658. After a short stay in Leghorn the two women got passage in a Dutch ship that reached Malta on 21 December 1658. A few days after their arrival they were interrogated by the Inquisition and arrested. After three months of detention in the house of the English consul in La Valletta, they were taken to the Inquisition prison in Birgu at the beginning of April 1659. The imprisonment of the two women lasted until the summer of 1662. During their stay in the Inquisition prison, the Quaker Daniel Baker went to Malta. He met the inquisitor and the new consul to intercede for them. Their freedom was requested by English shipmasters who visited the island, and by the consul. However, it was probably only through the intercession of Ludovic Stuart, seigneur d'Aubigny, lord almoner to Queen Henrietta Maria and Jansenist abbot of Haute Fontaine and canon of Notre Dame, who had been contracted by the Quakers Gilbert Latey and George Fox, that the two women were released in the summer of 1662. After staying almost three months in the consul's house, they got passage on the <i>Sapphire</i> and returned to England. Their letters and the accounts of their travels to Malta, arrest, and imprisonment, recounting their sufferings, fasting, and visions, were taken to England by Daniel Baker and published in 1662 (shortly before the announcement of their release). This miscellany of documents was republished in 1663 with the account of the last period of detention and of their release.<br>
<br>On 6 September 1663 Katharine Evans was arrested at Rochester, Kent, but released a few days later. According to the Quaker annalist John Whiting, she went to Scotland in 1663 together with Sarah Cheevers, and then they went to Ireland. They returned to England in May 1664  (Whiting, 221). On their way back they were arrested at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, and remained in prison for a few months. Shortly after their release Sarah Cheevers died. After the death of her friend, Katharine Evans continued her missionary work. In 1666 she was imprisoned at Welshpool, Montgomeryshire. In 1671 she was back in Ireland where she was arrested at Wicklow. On 29 January 1681 she was arrested at Bristol. She died in June 1692.<br>
