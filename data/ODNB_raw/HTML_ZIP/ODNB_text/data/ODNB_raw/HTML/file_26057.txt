<span class="headword">Southgate,  Henry</span>  (1818&#150;1888), <span class="occ">anthologist and auctioneer</span>, was born in London, the son of James Webb Southgate, floor cloth manufacturer and auctioneer. Little is known of his early life or education, but on 4 June 1840 he married Elizabeth Lawson Robertson (<i>b</i>. 1819/20). Southgate entered his father's business, and from 1840 to 1866 carried on his practice as an auctioneer of prints and engravings at 22 Fleet Street. The firm was known as Southgate and Barrett from 1845 until 1860, when the partnership was dissolved, and Southgate began gradually to take over the business. He had by this time made a considerable reputation as a compiler of selections in prose and verse from English classics.<br>
<br>Southgate's works include <span class="italic">Many thoughts on many things: being a treasury of reference, consisting of selections from the known great and the great unknown</span>, published in London in 1857; the third edition was extensively revised, and published under the title, <span class="italic">Many Thoughts of Many Minds</span> in November 1861. It had a large circulation and was frequently reprinted. The first edition was denounced by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in 1857 as &#145;an enormous book, an enormous blunder&#146;. It did, however, receive commendations from the <span class="italic">London Examiner</span> and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (5, 1858, 196), and in the nineteenth century was considered equal to Bartlett's <span class="italic">Familiar Quotations</span>. A second series was published in London in 1871. In 1864 appeared <span class="italic">What Men have said about Woman: a Collection of Choice Thoughts and Sentences</span>, which was reprinted in 1865 and 1866, while 1866 also saw the publication of <span class="italic">Musings about Men, Compiled and Analytically Arranged from the Writings of the Good and Great</span>, illustrated by Birket Foster and Sir John Gilbert; this was reprinted in 1868. <span class="italic">Noble thoughts in noble language: a collection of wise and virtuous utterances in prose and verse</span> appeared in 1871 and was reprinted in 1880. The book was arranged alphabetically from &#145;Ability&#146; to &#145;Zeal&#146;, and, after <span class="italic">Many Thoughts of Many Minds</span>, was the most popular of Southgate's compilations.<br>
<br>More thematic compilations included <span class="italic">Christus redemptor, being the life, character and teachings of Jesus Christ; illustrated in many passages from the writings of ancient and modern authors</span> (1874, 1880). Southgate also produced a book dedicated to his daughter Julia, entitled <span class="italic">Things a Lady would Like to Know Concerning Domestic Management and Expenditure</span> (1874, 1875); and in 1876 he dedicated <span class="italic">The Way to Woo and Win a Wife, Illustrated by a Series of Choice Extracts</span> to his wife, editor of her own anthology, <span class="italic">The Christian Life: being Thoughts in Prose and Verse from the Best Writers of All Ages</span> (1883).<br>
<br>During the last fifteen years of Southgate's life a collection of &#145;plates, cuttings, and extracts, printed and manuscript&#146;, was compiled by him for publication as <span class="italic">The Wealth and Wisdom of Literature, or, A Dictionary of Suggestive Thought</span>. A title-page was printed, but Southgate sought in vain to find a publisher for this huge anthology, which eventually extended to forty weighty volumes (with an alphabet from &#145;Abandoned&#146; to &#145;Zymotic&#146;).<br>
<br>From 1870 Southgate lived first at Salcombe and then at Sidmouth in south Devon. He afterwards moved to Ramsgate, Kent, where he died on 5 December 1888 at 32 Hardres Street.<br>
