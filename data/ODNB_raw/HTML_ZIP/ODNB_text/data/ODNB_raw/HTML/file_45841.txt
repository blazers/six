<span class="headword">Clark,  Emily Frederick</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1798&#150;1833), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was one of several daughters of a customs official named Clark (<i>d</i>. 1824) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1825), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10138/', "Felice Frederick (1725?&#150;1797)")</script>. Emily Clark described herself on the title-page of her first novel as &#145;grand-daughter of the late Colonel Frederick, Son of Theodore, King of Corsica&#146; and continued to invoke the name of her grandfather on the title-pages of her other novels and in her advertisements for private language teaching. It is fairly certain, however, that Felice Frederick was not the son of Theodore, although Clark probably believed it to be true, as she continued to assert her lineage in letters to the Royal Literary Fund as late as 1830. Her grandfather was a charming impostor who had fooled persons more august and astute than his granddaughter about his supposed royal parentage. He also wrote several volumes on Corsica, and was responsible for Emily Clark's education. One of her sisters was Eliza Fenwick (not the novelist of that name).<br>
<br>Emily Clark's life story consists largely of a desperate resistance to the decline, from at least assumed gentility, into penury, through an attempt to support her family: &#145;It is a cruel world for a female, whose expectations have been superior, to encounter&#146;  (19 Feb 1819, Royal Literary Fund archive). Educated to aspire to the higher arts, she exhibited miniatures at the Royal Academy in 1799. Yet her first novel, <span class="italic">Ianth&eacute;, or, The Flower of Caernarvon</span> (1798), was prefaced by the caveat: &#145;I declare that I have been impelled to exercise the talents, which nature has given me, to aid me in the support of myself, my sisters, and a mother, to whose cultivation they are so much indebted&#146;  (p. vi). The novel was dedicated by permission to the prince of Wales, and demonstrates a considerable familiarity with the Welsh countryside, as do most of her novels. In <span class="italic">Ianth&eacute;</span> pastoral is used in &#145;a contrast of peace and happiness in Wales with sorrow and deceit in London&#146;  (Todd, 85). Reviews of this first novel tended to focus on the motives for its production rather than its literary merits. This was also true of her second novel, <span class="italic">Ermina Montrose, or, The Cottage of the Vale</span> (1800), published by subscription, the list for which included several aristocrats, as well as Maria Edgeworth, who ordered twenty copies. The <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, after reminding readers of the recent death of Felice Frederick, carefully stated: &#145;independently of the good wishes we entertain for her welfare, as the descendant of Baron Neuhoff, we are happy to discover in her novel some traces of abilities, much above mediocrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, 1801, 355&#150;6). This novel eulogizes the life of the young heroine, who survives the early adventures of escaping from a convent in France and eluding the evil machinations of villainous monks. She manages to return to Wales unscathed, have her virtue proved, and marry and raise a family in perfect felicity.<br>
<br>By the time of Emily Clark's third novel, <span class="italic">The Banks of the Douro, or, The Maid of Portugal</span> (1805), the reviews had petered out, and the reviewers were becoming impatient, one describing the characters as a &#145;parcel of puppets&#146; who &#145;vanish out of sight&#146;, and recommending that Clark &#145;study our best novels with attention, if she means to give the world any more of her writings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Journal</span>, 1805, 644). The tone of such reviews and, worse still, the almost complete critical neglect of later works such as her volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1810), <span class="italic">Tales at the Fireside</span> (1817), or <span class="italic">The Esquimaux</span> (1819), meant that the Clark family were continually in dire financial straits.<br>
<br>In 1811 Emily Clark submitted the first of forty-two applications for monetary assistance to the Royal Literary Fund. The letters are increasingly pathetic and desperate, detailing debts incurred, the illnesses and deaths of her parents, and a horrific accident when a candle set alight her muslin dress, burning her badly, and preventing her from writing. As a result of this last calamity, she wrote to the committee: &#145;I am obliged to conceal where I reside, fearful of being arrested for my Doctor's bill &hellip; in consequence of my fatal accident&#146;  (7 Dec 1829, Royal Literary Fund archive). The continual stream of begging letters, heedless of the policy restricting the committee from assisting authors more than once in a year, caused a certain degree of impatience on the part of the board members and their associates, one of them referring to Clark as &#145;this mendicant annuitant&#146;  (Sir Benjamin Hobhouse to Joseph Snow, 7 Dec 1827, Royal Literary Fund archive). She herself felt the shame of her applications, maintaining that only &#145;[t]o shun despair&#146; had she &#145;humiliated&#146; herself &#145;to ask pecuniary aid of the amiable and feeling&#146;, and was conscious that the quality of her works made her less eligible for assistance than others:<blockquote>Far be it from me the presumption that I had any claim on the Committee, from my writings, which are very insignificant and little known &hellip; Though I have written nineteen volumes, one volume of real merit is more than worth the whole, and I can only wish as I have been destined to write that I had the genius of a Burney, or Sir Walter Scott (18 Jan 1830, Royal Literary Fund archive)</blockquote>Twenty-four of her pleas for assistance to the Royal Literary Fund were successful. The last such application occurred in 1833 (&#145;I am very weak and obliged to leave off writing&#146;; 7 March 1833, Royal Literary Fund archive), after which time Emily Clark, who remained unmarried, disappears from the historical record.<br>
