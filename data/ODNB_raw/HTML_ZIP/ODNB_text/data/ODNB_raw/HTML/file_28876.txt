<span class="headword">Watson,  William</span>, Baron Watson  (1827&#150;1899), <span class="occ">judge</span>, the elder son and second of the six children of Thomas Watson (1794&#150;1864), minister of the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Eleonora (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of David McHaffie of Eastwood and Overton, was born on 25 August 1827, at the manse, Covington, Lanarkshire. His parents were both Scottish and, like them, he became a member of the Church of Scotland. He was educated at the universities of Glasgow (1842&#150;3) and Edinburgh (1843&#150;7). Both later conferred on him the degree of LLD, the latter in 1875 and the former in 1879. He was admitted advocate on 8 March 1851, but had almost no practice until the 1860s. On 6 August 1868, then residing at 6 St Colme Street, Edinburgh, Watson married Margaret Bannatyne (1846&#150;3 March 1898), youngest daughter of Dugald John Bannatyne (1805&#150;1863), writer and solicitor, and his wife, Janet Bogle. They set up house in Dublin Street. Before moving to London on his promotion in 1880, they were living at 34 Moray Place. They had seven children&#151;six sons and one daughter. Their second son predeceased them in 1891. All their surviving sons became lawyers. The second and most distinguished of these, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36778/', "William Watson")</script>, became a lord of appeal in ordinary, in 1929, as Lord Thankerton of Thankerton.<br>
<br>In July 1865 Watson appeared for the defence in the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of Dr Edward Pritchard, the poisoner. Thereafter his practice grew steadily. In July 1874, when he was well established, Disraeli rewarded his Conservatism, then exceptional at the Scottish bar, with the office of solicitor-general for Scotland. On 6 November 1875 he was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates. In 1876 he succeeded Edward Strathearn Gordon as lord advocate and as member of parliament for the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. On 26 March 1878 he was sworn of the privy council, and on 2 April he was placed on the committee of the council for education in Scotland. In 1879 as lord advocate he successfully conducted the prosecution of the fraudulent directors of the City of Glasgow Bank, and he appeared in several civil actions which followed the bank's failure. On 28 April 1880 he was appointed a lord of appeal in ordinary, in place of Lord Gordon, who had died in August 1879. He was created a life peer by the title of Baron Watson of Thankerton, Lanarkshire, taking his seat on 7 May 1880.<br>
<br>With his limited experience Watson might well have occupied himself mainly with Scottish cases but he was, it seems, determined to make his mark as neither of his Scottish predecessors, the lords Colonsay and Gordon, had done. Almost from the outset he grappled with the multifarious, intricate, and frequently recondite legal problems then facing the House of Lords and the privy council, which exercised a much wider territorial jurisdiction than subsequently. Watson's natural acumen and assiduity gave soundness and solidity to his decisions. In later life he was reputed the most profound lawyer in the three kingdoms, and his influence was commensurate. His familiarity with the civil law, which he owed to his Scottish training, stood him in good stead in dealing with appeals from civil law systems (see <i>Gera v. Ciantar</i>, 1887), but where such aid failed him, as in vexed questions of domicile (see <i>Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier</i>, 1895) or French or Indian custom, his judgments were no less able. The part he took in determining the policy and practice of the privy council in Canadian appeals was of capital constitutional importance, and his mastery of English law, if less conspicuous, was hardly less consummate; the English bench and bar came to look on him as one of their own.<br>
<br>Watson's authority in Scots law was immense and he showed himself sedulous to preserve its purity where he saw no cause to follow English precedent (see <i>Royal Bank of Scotland v. Commercial Bank of Scotland</i>, 1882). Both on the bench and in the legislature, however, Watson was ready to work for its assimilation to English law where he thought it was justified. At times he carried this policy too far, as in <i>Mayor of Bradford v. Pickles</i> (1895), when he denied the existence in Scots law of an action in respect of malicious exercise of a right in order to prejudice a neighbour.<br>
<br>Watson was homely in appearance and unassuming in manner, though a merciless dissector of bad argument and famous for interrupting counsel in the course of argument in his anxiety to examine every aspect of the case before him. He never lost his broad Scottish accent or acquired niceties of English style. His judgments are distinguished by methodical arrangement rather than elegance. His &#145;Address on the repression of crime&#146;, delivered by him in 1877 before the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, is printed in the association's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. Watson was a keen sportsman&#151;an angler, an excellent shot, and a curler&#151;but was otherwise somewhat indolent. He would probably have been happier living a quiet country life than dispensing justice in the most august tribunals of the British empire.<br>
<br>In London Watson lived at 20 Queen's Gate, but he kept up a Scottish residence. At the time of his death it was Sunlaws House, Kelso, Roxburghshire, where he died on 14 September 1899 from an enlarged prostate and cystitis. His funeral took place in Edinburgh on 19 September 1899.<br>
