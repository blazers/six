<span class="headword">Kidd <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>MacDonald]</span>, Dame  Margaret Henderson</span>  (1900&#150;1989), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 14 March 1900 at Grange Park, Carriden, Bo'ness, Linlithgowshire, the elder daughter of James Kidd (1872&#150;1928) and his wife, Janet Gardner Turnbull (1872&#150;1930), a teacher. Her parents were both Scottish. Her father was a much respected solicitor and (Unionist) MP for the local seat of West Lothian (Linlithgowshire); and on his death in 1928 she contested the seat in the unionist cause but was defeated by Emanuel Shinwell. She was educated at Linlithgow Academy and thereafter at the University of Edinburgh, where she graduated MA and LLB in 1922. Her early legal training was with Mitchell and Baxter, writers to the signet, in Edinburgh where the young Robert Louis Stevenson had preceded her. She had hoped to pursue a diplomatic career but despite the passing of the <span class="roman">Sex Disqualification Act</span>, 1919, it was not considered possible. It was her father's suggestion that she should go to the bar &#145;and have fun&#146;.<br>
<br>When she passed advocate in July 1923 Kidd became the first female member of the Faculty of Advocates, the Scottish bar; and between 1923 and 1948 she remained the only lady advocate. Then and indeed until very much later, the ladies' robing-room was situated off a lower corridor in Parliament House, opposite the condemned cell. Margaret Kidd recalled that hot water was put in only after the Second World War. Although her practice was wide, it centred on family law, where she was appreciated by her contemporaries as adding a new dimension to old problems. She was later to recommend that a family court at sheriff court level would be more responsive. Kidd was the first lady advocate to appear before the House of Lords and before a parliamentary select committee; and in 1948 she had the distinction of becoming the first woman KC in Britain, if only by a few months. By that time she had been standing junior counsel for the Post Office and for the Ministry of Works.<br>
<br>Kidd married Donald Somerled MacDonald (<i>d</i>. 1958) on 22 March 1930. He was a writer to the signet and son of a barrister. They had a daughter, Anne, who married a Cambridge surgeon. Much of Kidd's adult life was spent in India Street, Edinburgh, where she regretted the lack of a proper garden. Her flat was filled with plants as well as legal books, good furniture, and paintings. She was kind, welcoming, and encouraging. Herself one of a large family, she always maintained a strong affection and interest in not only her own family and grandchildren, but also her extended family at the bar. Kidd was tall and, even in later life, retained the clear eyes and complexion that can be seen reflected in her portrait as a young advocate hanging in the advocates' reading-room.<br>
<br>In 1960 Kidd became the first lady sheriff-principal when she was appointed to Dumfries and Galloway. Appointed to Perth in 1966, then the most prestigious of the sheriff-principaldoms, she held the post until retirement in 1974. As sheriff-principal she exercised both a criminal and a civil jurisdiction, apart from the very wide administrative duties which were part of her appointment. Kidd herself took the view that women made particularly apt administrators. In addition, she was keeper of the Advocates' Library, one of the Faculty of Advocates' main honorary posts, from 1956 to 1969. Her successor, A. J. Mackenzie-Stuart, later became the first United Kingdom judge in Europe. Kidd was also editor of the Court of Session law reports of the <span class="italic">Scots Law Times</span> from 1942 until 1976. During all that time she never failed to meet her set timetable, and wrote her reporters' reports for them where they had failed. Her editor's strength lay in her ability to marshal facts in an orderly fashion.<br>
<br>Kidd had a very active public role in Scotland. She cared about her Christian faith. An assistant lecturer in public law at Edinburgh University, she was also a founder member of the Stair Society. She became a vice-president of the Federation of University Women and of the Electrical Association for Women. A tireless worker for a number of charities, she acted as chairwoman of the Queen's Nursing Institute in Scotland and for Blind Welfare. In addition, Kidd served as a member of the royal commission on betting, lotteries and gaming in 1950 (and said that she always enjoyed a good point-to-point). In 1975 she was made a DBE. She received an honorary LLD from Dundee University in 1982 and Edinburgh University in 1984.<br>
<br>Kidd was a traditionalist, a Conservative by temperament and training. But she could be both formidable and constructive in her criticism of the legal and university institutions of Scotland and of the Conservative Party. Professionally, she did not consider herself discriminated against. Never impressed by her own success, she said that she &#145;had a lot of luck to be in the right place at the right time&#146;. Those who knew her well pointed to her remarkable integrity, self-discipline, and sheer hard work. As Lord Hope of Craighead said at her death,<blockquote>Her success was won by strength of character, courage and integrity and it is a mark of her true qualities that despite what might seem to be the revolutionary nature of her achievements she always held the affection and respect of others. (Hope)</blockquote>Dame Margaret Kidd died at 53 Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 22 March 1989. A funeral service was held at the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh. The Scottish bar, and its lady members in particular, owe her a deep debt for the qualities and standards she brought and maintained as its first lady member.<br>
