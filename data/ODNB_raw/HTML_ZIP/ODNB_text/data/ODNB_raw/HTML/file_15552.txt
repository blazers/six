<span class="headword">King,  Charles</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1713&#150;1721), <span class="occ">merchant and writer on economics</span>, was a significant contributor to the <span class="italic">British Merchant</span>, a periodical which appeared twice weekly during the hotly debated negotiations towards a commercial treaty with France following the close of the War of the Spanish Succession in summer 1713. The details of his background, family life, and later career are unknown, and nor is it known if he married or had children.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">British Merchant</span> was one of a number of periodicals and a rash of pamphlets that followed news of the eighth and ninth, commercial, articles of the treaty of Utrecht, which opened the possibility of a new, less restrictive, trading agreement with France. A consequence of the treaty, if passed by parliament, would be the repeal of a number of laws laying high duties on French imports. Tory sentiment in favour of the eighth and ninth articles was effectively propagandized by the <span class="italic">Mercator</span>, a paper funded by Viscount Bolingbroke and largely written by Daniel Defoe. It argued that a ready market existed for British goods in France, despite legal prohibitions on trade that had been established in wartime, and that Britain would be a net gainer from any trade with France. The Dutch and Italians, it was argued, imported British goods, then re-exported these to France at a considerable gain, and a net loss to British producers and shipping.<br>
<br>The opponents of the commercial articles of the treaty, drawn mainly from the ranks of the whigs, were convinced that a more open trade with France would be fatal for some infant industries, such as silk manufacturing, and detrimental to Britain's comparative advantage in general. The <span class="italic">British Merchant</span> concocted statistics to show the treaty would result in an adverse trading balance of &pound;1.4 million. Woollen and linen makers were to the fore in the campaign against the treaty. It was also felt that the new treaty would endanger the Portugal trade established by the Methuen treaty (1703). The earl of Halifax was the major supporter of the <span class="italic">British Merchant</span>, and King was taken on, alongside Joshua Gee, Henry Martyn, and other leading figures of the merchant community, to rally opposition. The paper ceased publication after parliament voted down the disputed articles, prompting the collapse of that part of the treaty. Some of the most important numbers, however, had a prolonged life and influence, being collected by King in three volumes as <span class="italic">The British Merchant, or, Commerce Preserv'd</span> in 1721. By this date King had been appointed as chamber-keeper to the Treasury, and the exchequer provided funds for the printing and circulation of the work to each of the corporate towns and boroughs of the nation. The collection enjoyed an authoritative status lasting until mid-century; the last edition was published in 1743. Rather than containing any advances in the theory of trade, the work represented a compilation of contemporary merchant opinion. The writers, King included, had been especially concerned to refute what they saw as the fallacious doctrine of reciprocity as advocated by Bolingbroke and Defoe. Most held fast to mercantilist nostrums of maximizing exports of manufactured goods and minimizing the import of foreign wares. An unregulated overseas trade was held to be an unreliable basis for national prosperity. King sought to preserve the home market for British-made goods, and argued that the &#145;first and best market of England are the natives and inhabitants of England&#146;  (King, 1.165&#150;6). Such ideas would prevail in commercial policy debates until the later part of the eighteenth century.<br>
