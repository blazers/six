<span class="headword">Hatton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kemble; <em>other married name </em>Curtis]</span>,  Ann Julia</span>  (1764&#150;1838), <span class="occ">writer and actress</span>, was born on 29 April 1764 in Worcester, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15325/', "Roger Kemble (1722&#150;1802)")</script>, owner of a travelling theatre company, and his wife, Sarah Ward (1735&#150;1807). Her siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25516/', "Sarah Siddons (1755&#150;1831)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15322/', "John Philip Kemble (1757&#150;1823)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15316/', "Charles Kemble (1775&#150;1854)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15326/', "Stephen George Kemble (1758&#150;1822)")</script>. Congenitally lame and scarred by smallpox, she claimed that she was neglected by both parents, and although nicknamed the Genius by other members of the family, received little schooling. She was apprenticed to a mantua maker before going on the stage. Her marriage to an actor, C. Curtis (<i>d</i>. 1817), proved bigamous but it was as Ann Curtis that she published <span class="italic">Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects</span> (1783). Accusing her family of failing to help her, a newspaper advertisement of 1783 solicited donations from the public to relieve her financial distress; she lectured at James Graham's notorious &#145;Temple of Health&#146;, and later attempted to poison herself in Westminster Abbey. A press report of 1789 indicates that she was working in a bagnio when she was accidentally shot in the eye.<br>
<br>On 30 January 1792, Ann Julia married William Hatton (<i>d</i>. 1806), and a year later went to America where she addressed an ode to the Democratic Society of New York and wrote the libretto for an opera, <span class="italic">Tammany, or, The Indian Chief</span>, first performed in 1794. Yellow fever drove the Hattons to Nova Scotia but by 1799 they had returned to Britain and settled in Swansea where William Hatton took out a lease on the bathing house, providing bathing machines, an assembly room, and lodgings for visitors to the &#145;Brighton of Wales&#146;. After her husband died in 1806 Ann Julia kept a dancing school in Kidwelly; she returned to Swansea in 1809 and made her home there for the rest of her life. For many years she received an allowance from her relatives on condition (so it was said) that she lived at least a hundred miles from London.<br>
<br>For some years Ann Julia Hatton was connected with the Swansea Theatre. In 1803 J. T. Barber described her as lame and grossly overweight, but in reciting &#145;Alexander's Feast&#146;, &#145;the lady did not fail to exhibit a vivid tincture of the family genius&#146;  (Ross, 83). In 1810 she wrote <span class="italic">Zaffine</span> for Edmund Kean and the following year adapted a novel by Madame de Genlis. At Neath in 1815 her performance of Lady Randolph in <span class="italic">Douglas</span> was so well received that it was announced in <span class="italic">The Cambrian</span> that she intended playing Calista in <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, &#145;expressly after the manner of Mrs Siddons&#146;  (Price, 120). According to J. Jones, however, the &#145;Old rancarous hag&#146; [<i>sic</i>] had become &#145;The scoff of grinning Neath&#146;  (Jones, &#145;To Mrs Hatton&#146;).<br>
<br>Ann Julia Hatton's first prose work was possibly &#145;The Unknown, or, The Knight of the Blood-Red Plume&#146;  (Haining, 1.200&#150;26), a story which appeared anonymously in <span class="italic">Welsh Legends</span> (1802). In 1810 <span class="italic">Cambrian Pictures</span>, the first of her fourteen novels, was published under the pen-name Ann of Swansea. At her best, she was capable of writing fluent narrative and lively dialogue, but the novels are immensely long and for the most part undeniably tedious. As she confesses in the preface to <span class="italic">Lovers and Friends</span> (1821), &#145;an author finds his inventive faculties spun as thin as a cobweb in supplying the requisite number of pages for his story&#146;. The novels, all but one published by the Minerva Press, have some generic interest in reflecting the literary fashions of the time&#151;<span class="italic">Sicilian Mysteries</span> (1812) is a pale imitation of Ann Radcliffe's Gothic tales while both <span class="italic">Secret Avengers</span> (1815) and <span class="italic">Cesario Rosalba</span> (1819) feature Byronic anti-heroes. <span class="italic">Cambrian Pictures</span>, <span class="italic">Secrets in every Mansion</span> (1818), and <span class="italic">Gerald Fitzgerald</span> (1831) utilize motifs familiar in contemporary fictions of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. <span class="italic">Gonzalo de Baldivia</span> (1817), dedicated to William Wilberforce, includes the story of an African family brutally transported to the Peruvian silver mines, annotated with a personal statement by the author deploring slavery. <span class="italic">Conviction</span> (1814) is notable for a self-portrait: Mrs Mortimer, author of <span class="italic">Welsh Likenesses</span>, a &#145;coarse, large, ill-shaped creature&#146;, who squints abominably and is pitted with the smallpox  (3.204), vigorously denies that she is about to bring out a novel containing &#145;scandalous anecdotes of this most immaculate town&#146;  (3.238). Ann Julia Hatton herself, however, did not scruple to reveal in <span class="italic">Chronicles of an Illustrious House</span> (1816) that &#145;your little town of Gooselake abounds with all the vices of the metropolis&#146;  (2.120). The novel caused a furore in Swansea.<br>
<br>Ann Julia Hatton was a prolific writer of verse. <span class="italic">Poetic Trifles</span> (1811) includes the celebrated &#145;Swansea Bay&#146;. In 1832 she was seeking subscriptions for <span class="italic">Fifty-Two Poetic Cumaean Leaves. Predicting the Destiny of Ladies and Gentlemen</span>. In 1834 she approached the publisher Richard Bentley with <span class="italic">The Raconteur</span>, and presented a scrapbook of verse to the young Swansea physician, Dr Douglas Cohen, fulfilling a promise that she would write him a poem every day for a year. Although &#145;A Resident of Swansea&#146; described her at seventy as &#145;still a splendid woman&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 7.175), her autobiographical verses are a poignant expression of her sense of desolation in old age, as well as conveying her bitterness towards her family.<br>
<br>Ann Julia Hatton wrote &#145;Farewell Lines&#146; to Dr Cohen on 28 September 1838 and dictated her last letter to him on 21 December, &#145;when in <i>articula mortis</i>&#146;  (D. Cohen to J. D. Francis). She died on 26 December 1838 at 15 Park Street, and was buried in St John's churchyard on 31 December. Brought up a protestant like her mother, it is said that she died a Catholic like her father. The bulk of her estate was left to Mary Johns, her servant.<br>
