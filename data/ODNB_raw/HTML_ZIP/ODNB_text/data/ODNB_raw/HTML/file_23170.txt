<span class="headword">Ravenet,  Simon Fran&ccedil;ois</span>  (1721&#150;1774), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Paris and trained there with Jacques Philippe Le Bas. Little of his early work is known, but he must have been well respected at an early age, since he was among those chosen to engrave reproductions of Charles Le Brun's decorative paintings at Versailles for Jean-Baptiste Mass&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Grande galerie de Versailles</span> (1731&#150;51); the engravers involved in this ambitious volume are described on the title-page as &#145;les meilleurs Ma&icirc;tres du tems&#146;. Engravers trained in the virtuoso techniques developed in seventeenth-century Paris were still unsurpassed in the mid-eighteenth century, and in 1743 when William Hogarth wanted to publish high-quality reproductions of his <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span> paintings he went out of his way to commission French engravers. Ravenet travelled to London to engrave the fourth and fifth of the series (the others were engraved by Bernard Baron and G&eacute;rard Scotin), and he appears to have settled into the &eacute;migr&eacute; community, never returning to France.<br>
<br>In 1745&#150;6 Richard Dalton employed Ravenet to engrave a series of large prints of classical sculpture in Italian collections and, with Jean Baptiste Claude Chatelain, to engrave a scene from book 6 of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. In 1752 he engraved the first of the large plates after John van Rymsdyck's drawings showing the dissection of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy for William Hunter's <span class="italic">Anatomy of the Human Gravid Uterus</span>, eventually published in 1774. In 1753 he engraved Benjamin Wilson's painting <span class="italic">David Garrick and Miss Bellamy as Romeo and Juliet</span>, which was sold by subscription, possibly at the painter's instigation.<br>
<br>The majority of Ravenet's work was produced for large-scale publishers: Robert Sayer, John and Paul Knapton, and, especially, John Boydell. In 1759 or 1760 Ravenet was working again with Hogarth on two illustrations after the artist for the second edition of Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> (vol. 1, 1760; vol. 4, 1761). Hogarth hoped that Ravenet would also engrave his controversial painting <span class="italic">Sigismunda Mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo</span>, but the subscription was stopped on 26 March 1761 after about three weeks, evidently because Ravenet was committed to a project for Boydell. He had already been employed by Boydell to engrave Andrea Casali's <span class="italic">Gunhilda</span> (priced at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.), one of five prints issued to subscribers in April 1761 after paintings at the first exhibition of the Society of Artists (the other four were engraved by William Woollett). In 1763 Boydell advertised for subscriptions to <span class="italic">A Collection of Prints, Engraved from the most Capital Paintings in England</span>. The series was published in three volumes from 1769 to 1773 under the title <span class="italic">Sculptura Britannica</span>, and its huge international success marked the beginning of the domination of the European art world by British print-publishers. Ravenet produced about a quarter of the prints in the first volume and most of those in the second.<br>
<br>Ravenet played a significant part in the London art institutions that were coming into being in the late eighteenth century, sitting on the committee of the Society of Artists in 1767 and in 1770 joining the Royal Academy as one of only six associate engravers. In 1772, after the artist's death, Ravenet engraved Hogarth's paintings of <span class="italic">The Pool of Bethesda</span> and <span class="italic">The Good Samaritan</span> at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, working with Victor Marie Picot and Jean Marie Delattre, who were partners in a printselling business in St Martin's Lane. Picot was married to Ravenet's daughter Angelique. About this time Ravenet retired to Kentish Town, then a suburban village. He died there on 2 April 1774.<br>
<br>Ravenet's son, also Simon Fran&ccedil;ois Ravenet (1748&#150;1814), followed in his father's footsteps as an engraver. It is possible that a number of small portraits and book illustrations signed &#145;Ravenet&#146; may be his juvenile work rather than that of his father. He moved to Paris in the mid-1770s and studied under Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher. In 1779 he was appointed engraver to the duke of Parma, became director of the academy in Parma, and made a series of engravings of the paintings of Correggio in that city.<br>
