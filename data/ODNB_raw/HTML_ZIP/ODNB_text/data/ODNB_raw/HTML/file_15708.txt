<span class="headword">Knell,  Thomas, the younger</span>  (1543/4&#150;<em>c.</em>1592), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and pamphleteer</span>, was presumably the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15707/', "Thomas Knell the elder (d. 1576/7)")</script>. When ordained deacon on 24 June 1567 by Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, he was living at Great Stambridge, Essex, stated that he had been born in Canterbury, and gave his age as twenty-three. Grindal ordained him priest on 17 April 1568, merely as &#145;of London&#146;. He was probably, therefore, the &#145;Mr&#146; Thomas Knell who was paid &pound;4 per quarter for serving (presumably as curate) in the London parish of St James Garlickhithe between Easter and Christmas 1568 and again for the quarter ending at Lady day 1570. Meanwhile he appears to have served as curate in St Giles Cripplegate during 1569.<br>
<br>Failing to find higher preferment Knell seems to have plunged into the Elizabethan equivalent of tabloid journalism. In the will of an obscure London curate, Henry Holtbie, proved on 4 August 1568, he was bequeathed a copy of <span class="italic">The palace of pleasure</span> on condition that he restore to Holtbie's wife all the other books that he had borrowed. In 1569 he published, in verse, <span class="italic">An epitaph, or rather a short discourse made upon the life &amp; death of D. [Edmund] Boner, Bisshop of London</span>. Probably in response to the northern rising of 1569&#150;70 there followed a flurry of anti-Catholic verse tracts. These effusions were undoubtedly intended to win him promotion but in the event they were unsuccessful.<br>
<br>It is not clear whether it was he or Thomas Knell the elder who on 21 March 1570 received letters patent for the vicarage of Dartford, Kent, from the lord keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon. The presentation was made at the petition of Lord Mountjoy and at the commendation of James Pilkington, bishop of Durham, but no institution is subsequently recorded. Knell the younger was present on 8 August 1570 at the execution of John Felton, condemned for setting up in the churchyard of St Paul's Cathedral Pius V's bull excommunicating Elizabeth, and accordingly published <span class="italic">A piththy note to papists all and some that joy in Feltons martirdome</span>. The anonymous title-page states that the tract, which enshrines a blow-by-blow account of the execution, was &#145;set forth by one that knew his life, and was with him at the hour of his death&#146;. Only on the final page did he reveal himself as &#145;T. Knel Juni.&#146; This was followed in early 1571 by <span class="italic">A declaration of such tempestious, and outragious fluddes, as hath been in England</span>, previously attributed to Knell senior, and <span class="italic">An historicall discource of the life and death of doctor Story</span>, a diatribe against Bonner's hated chancellor, John Story, executed for treason on 1 June 1571.<br>
<br>Since the composition record for St Nicholas Acon, London (15 March 1571), clearly states that the new incumbent was Thomas Knell &#145;senior&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 334/8, fol. 236<i>v</i>), both logic and chronology suggest that it was the elder Thomas who also subsequently held, but quickly relinquished, the vicarages of Hackney, Middlesex, and of St Bride, London, between early 1571 and early 1574. In that case nothing further is known of the younger man's activities until the latter months of 1573 when, in the wake of the <span class="italic">Admonition to the parliament</span> (1572) many Londoners suspected of nonconformity, both men and women, were required to sign a form of subscription to the English prayer book. Since Knell was one of them&#151;his signature is preserved among the Petyt MSS as &#145;Thomas Knell Jnr&#146;&#151;his nonconformity may have prompted him to retire from the capital.<br>
<br>Thus the younger Thomas Knell may have been the &#145;Mr Knell clerke&#146; who, along with his wife, was presented during Archbishop Parker's episcopal visitation of 1573 for not receiving communion in the parish of St Alphege, Canterbury, at Easter or since. Of two tracts published in 1581, <span class="italic">Certain true marks wherby to knowe a papist</span> is signed only &#145;Thomas Knell&#146; but <span class="italic">A Godlie and Necesserie Treatise, Touching the Use and Abuse of Praier</span> is clearly by Thomas Knell the elder. It seems likely that the younger Knell died about 1592 since a probate record exists for one Thomas Knell, clerk, of the parish of Kenardington, Kent.<br>
