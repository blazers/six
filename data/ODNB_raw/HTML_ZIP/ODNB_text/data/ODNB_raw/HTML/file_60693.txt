<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armour,  Jean</span>  (1765&#150;1834), <span class="occ">wife of Robert Burns and subject of poetry</span>, was born in Mauchline, Ayrshire, on 25 February 1765, the second of the eleven children of James Armour and his wife, Mary Smith. The family lived in Mauchline's Cowgate. James Armour was a master mason whose work included Dumfries House and commissions for the duke of Argyll at Inveraray; a black marble punchbowl, worked by her father from the Inveraray project, was among Armour's wedding presents. Less is known about Armour's mother, aside from her reputation for liking music, and her encouragement of her daughter to practise singing and dancing.<br>
<br>Armour's education was brief due to domestic demands. She attended the local school under Andrew Noble (later the session clerk who recorded her name, along with Burns's, for fornication). Her minister, William &#145;Daddy&#146; Auld, also later chastized her, along with Burns. Armour met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4093/', "Robert Burns")</script> in Mauchline, probably early in 1784, soon after he came to the neighbouring parish of Mossgiel. As she recalled in 1827 to John McDiarmid, editor of the <span class="italic">Dumfries Courier</span>, on their first meeting Burns's dog had run over Armour's clothes, which were spread on the bleach-green:<blockquote>I scolded, and threw something at the animal. Burns said, &#145;Lassie, if you thought ought o' me, ye wadna hurt my dog!&#146;&#151;I thought to myself&#151;&#145;I wadna think much o' you at ony rate!&#146; I saw him afterwards at a dancing-room and we fell acquainted. (Westwood, 15)</blockquote>Burns recalled John Blane speaking highly of Armour's voice and this attracted him strongly: later he praised her &#145;wood-note wild&#146; to correspondents including George Thomson  (2 July[?] 1793, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.180).<br>
<br>Against the orders of her parents Armour and Burns continued to meet. They became lovers by the end of 1785 and soon Jean was pregnant. Due to her parents' objection the couple could not perform a conventional marriage and instead signed a paper&#151;a certificate of marriage&#151;in March or April 1786 in the presence of witnesses. Armour's father had the paper mutilated, thus nullifying the union. Jean was sent during her confinement to Paisley, where she stayed with her uncle, Andrew Purdie. Meanwhile her father took out a warrant to have Burns imprisoned until he found security for Armour and her child; this precipitated Burns's move into hiding, &#145;wandering from one friend's house to another&#146;, as he explained to John Richmond  (30 July 1786, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.35).<br>
<br>Armour returned to Mauchline in early summer 1786. There, on 18 June, she refused to account for herself in person to the kirk session, and instead sent a letter: &#145;I am heartily sorry that I have given and must give your Session trouble, on my account. I acknowledge that I am with child, and Robert Burns in Mossgiel is the father&#146;  (session minutes, Westwood, 18). Several weeks later Burns told John Richmond that he had &#145;waited on Armour since her return&#146;, though not &#145;from any the least view of reconciliation, but merely to ask for her health; and to you I will confess it, from a foolish hankering fondness&#146;. He explained that he was prepared to accept William Auld's request to acknowledge paternity and so, in return, receive &#145;a Certificate as single man&#146;  (9 July 1786, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.32). Burns would later express his low opinion of the Armours, particularly as their previously hostile attitude to him changed following the success of the Kilmarnock edition of his poems, published in July 1786. As he wrote to James Smith, &#145;If any thing had been wanting to disgust me completely at Armour's family, their mean, servile compliance would have done it&#146;  (11 June 1787, ibid. 1.95).<br>
<br>On 3 September 1786 Armour gave birth to twins, Robert and Jean. In all she and Burns had nine children, three of whom survived infancy; in addition she raised Burns's daughter Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1791) from his affair with Anna Park. Of the twins Robert was sent to Mossgiel to be cared for by his father's family while Jean died in October 1787. By this time her mother was again pregnant, Armour and Burns having revived their relationship in the summer. In December Armour was once more called before the kirk session and went to stay with William Muir at Tarbolton Mill (Burns was in Edinburgh), returning to Mauchline in February 1788. Burns now took a room for himself and Armour in Mauchline's Backcauseway; he also visited Ellisland, on the River Nith, north of Dumfries, to plan for their future together there. On 3 March 1788 Armour bore him twin girls, who died a few days later. About this time the couple were married by a magistrate in a civil ceremony at the office of the Mauchline lawyer Gerald Hamilton, and the union was confirmed by the kirk session on 5 August 1788. In June Burns had moved to a farm at Ellisland and Armour joined him at the end of the year.<br>
<br>Before their marriage Burns's letters suggest some unkindness to Armour, particularly in his correspondence to her rivals in love. In an infamous letter to Agnes Maclehose (23 February 1788) Burns referred to &#145;a certain woman.&#151;I am disgusted with her; I cannot endure her! &hellip; Here was tasteless insipidity, vulgarity of soul, and mercenary fawning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.194&#150;5). Even less chivalrous is the often quoted letter to Robert Ainslie, in which Burns describes visiting Armour, reconciling her to her mother, and giving her a mahogany bed and a guinea; moreover, &#145;I have f&#151;d her till she rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory &hellip; I swore her, privately and solemnly, never to attempt to claim on me as a husband &hellip; She did all this like a good girl&#146;  (3 March 1788, ibid. 1.200).<br>
<br>After their marriage, however, Burns's tone became uniformly affectionate, even when the union was not yet public. To James Smith he spoke of his &#145;clean-limbed, handsome, bewitching young hussy&#146;: &#145;my girl has been <i>doubly</i> kinder to me than even the best of women &hellip; in similar circumstances&#146;  (28 April 1788, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.218). Writing to his close companion Robert Ainslie he claimed that his marriage had given &#145;a stability to my mind &amp; resolutions, unknown before; and the poor girl has the most sacred enthusiasm of attachment to me, and has not a wish but to gratify my every idea of her deportment&#146;  (26 May 1788, ibid. 1.223). To his patron Frances Anna Wallace (Mrs Dunlop) he praised Armour as a housewife and &#145;agreeable companion&#146;, noting that &#145;The Muses must not be offended when I tell them, the concerns of my wife &amp; family will, in my mind, always take the Pas&#146;  (10 Aug 1788, ibid. 1.234). Burns later spoke of Jean's good health, describing her as one of the &#145;hale, sprightly damsels, that are bred among the Hay &amp; Heather&#146;  (11 April 1791, ibid. 2.68), and, again to Dunlop, praised her as an enthusiastic mother &#145;determined to make me the Patriarchal leader of a band&#146;  (24 Sept 1792, ibid. 2.125).<br>
<br>Burns's letters to Armour suggest their early, passionate attachment developed into a close, affectionate, and mutually nurturing relationship. On 14 October 1788 Burns wrote to inform her about the recent offer of a furnished house: &#145;I am extremely happy at the idea of your coming to Nithsdale, as it will save us from these cruel separations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.265). A month earlier he had shown an intimacy and lack of affectation that was unusual in his correspondence: &#145;My dear Love, I received your kind letter with a pleasure which no letter but one from you could have given me.&#151;I dreamed of you the whole night last.&#146; Moreover, he made clear his regard for Armour's judgement on song: &#145;I had [a fine] Strathspey among my hands to m[ake verses to,] for Johnson's Collection&#146;  (12 Sept 1788, ibid. 1.254). As these remarks on her knowledge of song indicate, Armour acted on occasion as a sounding board for Burns's compositions, recalling airs for his use in writing new settings.<br>
<br>Armour and Burns spent their final years together in Dumfries, moving there in late summer 1791, first to the Wee Vennel (now Bank Street) and, from May 1793, in Mill Hole Brae (now Burns Street). Burns's final letter to Jean, written from the Brow Well on 14 July 1796, showed the depth of his feeling for &#145;My dearest love&#146; and sought to minimize his distress to spare her feelings:<blockquote>I delayed writing until I could tell you what effect sea-bathing was likely to produce &hellip; it has eased my pains, and I think has strengthened me; but my appetite is still extremely bad &hellip; I am very happy to hear by Miss Jessy Lewars that you are all well. My very best and kindest compliments to her, and to all the children. (16 July 1796, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.329)</blockquote>Two days later Burns wrote to her father of his fears for his &#145;poor girl, without a friend&#146;  (ibid., 2.330), who was shortly to give birth to their ninth child. Burns died at home on 21 July 1796 and their son, Maxwell, was born on 25 July, the day of Burns's funeral.<br>
<br>At the time of her bereavement Armour was responsible for six children: Robert, Francis, William, Betty (Anna Park's child), James, and Maxwell, who died in 1799. She did not obtain money from Burns's estate until October. As the widow of an excise officer, Armour received a pension of &pound;12 a year, and a benefactor took over her rent. A trust fund was established to provide for the family and to assist the children when they reached the age of twenty-one. Armour gave over Burns's papers to his biographer, James Currie, who also sought to benefit the family from the proceeds of his work. However, Armour has often been criticized for this action, or at least for not making sure that the papers were returned.<br>
<br>In the decades following Burns's death Jean Armour was celebrated as a living link to the poet, her fame growing in parallel with the development of her husband's status. In this period, and now a grandmother, she sat for several portraits, including that by John Alexander Gilfillan (1822, Scot. NPG). She also drew the attention of writers when, in a well-known incident, she missed a visit from Dorothy and William Wordsworth, being at the coast with her children. Armour was of particular interest to writers from working-class backgrounds like James Hogg and Allan Cunningham. Hogg first encountered her in 1804 at St Michael's Church, Dumfries, while working at Mitchel Slacks farm. Looking back he recalled her as &#145;then smartly dressed, had fine eyes, and looked very well. She had several wooers.&#146; In 1811 or 1812 Hogg met Jean again in Edinburgh and wrote later of having &#145;scarcely ever met a woman, either high or low who improved as much on acquaintance. She had a great deal of good sense and good nature&#146;  (Hogg, 246).<br>
<br>In later life Armour suffered a series of strokes and was cared for by a granddaughter. She died at her home on Mill Hole Brae, Dumfries, on 26 March 1834 and was buried on 1 April next to her husband in the Burns mausoleum, St Michael's Church. Understandably, Jean Armour's life has been overshadowed by her husband's, but equally she would not be remembered without him. Burns celebrated his Mauchline Belle&#151;a &#145;delicious &hellip; armful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.63)&#151;in about a dozen songs, including &#145;I hae a wife o' my ain&#146;, &#145;My wife's the winsome wee thing&#146;, &#145;The Bonie lad that's far awa&#146;, and &#145;Of a' the airts the winds can blaw&#146;, which celebrates &#145;The Lassie I lo'e best&#146;. Among the wider community she was also regarded with affection and respect, as shown in a description of her funeral:<blockquote>The attendance of invited mourners was &hellip; a handful, compared with the crowd &hellip; [of] men, women, and children &hellip; There were few persons within reach of the handspokes, on which the coffin was borne, that did not, after an old and affecting Scottish custom, show their respect &hellip; by assisting to carry her remains in their passage to their honoured resting place. (&#145;Funeral of Mrs Burns&#146;)</blockquote>Since her death Jean Armour has continued to attract affection and admiration, particularly in Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. Recent commemorations have included the unveiling of statues in Mauchline (2002) and Dumfries (2004). In January 2009, on the 250th anniversary of the poet's birth, stained-glass windows of Armour and Burns were installed at St Michael's. Such commemorations demonstrate a continuing appreciation of her importance for her husband's life and work. It is an appreciation eloquently expressed by John De Lancey Ferguson, editor of the poet's correspondence, for whom Armour was<blockquote>the real heroine of Burns's life, for of all the women who, more or less, loved him, and whom he, more or less, loved, she alone had to live with him, and did so &#147;not weighing his merits, but pardoning his offences&#148;. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.343)</blockquote>
