<span class="headword">Sunley,  Bernard</span>  (1910&#150;1964), <span class="occ">property developer</span>, was born on 4 November 1910 at 46 Jugela Street, Catford, London, the son of John Sunley and his wife, Emily Martha Gillies. He was educated at St Anne's School, Hanwell, Middlesex. He left school at the age of fourteen to help his father, who worked as a muck shifter with a pony and cart. Described in 1910 as a landscape gardener, by 1931 John Sunley was listed as a retired florist and fruiterer. Sunley himself made a brief move into the landscape gardening business, but earned his first fortune from earth moving, via Blackwood Hodge Ltd, a company of which he was chairman until his death. This firm also acted as agents for a number of motor vehicle-related products. Its clients included General Motors, Cummins Diesel, and Rolls-Royce.<br>
<br>On 18 November 1931 Sunley married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), daughter of William Goddard, a farmer from Southall; they had one son and two daughters. Like several other property developers, Sunley entered the property industry first as a contractor, establishing his building company, Bernard Sunley &amp; Sons Ltd, in 1940. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bernard Sunley Investment Trust shortly before the latter company went public. During his thirties Sunley considered leaving business for a career in politics. He stood as Conservative candidate for Ealing West in 1945, but was defeated.<br>
<br>By this time, however, Sunley had already established the property development company which was to form the basis of his post-war fortune. Bernard Sunley Investment Trust Ltd was founded in 1944. Its development projects were to range from office blocks in the City and West End to flats, hotels, and shops in the Bahamas, and Sunley served as its chairman and managing director until his death. The company was publicly floated in 1959, with an issued capital of &pound;1.5 million. In 1960 a further development company, Sunley Homes, was acquired as a subsidiary, to develop residential property.<br>
<br>Bernard Sunley Investment Trust developed close financial links with Eagle Star. In 1961 Eagle Star agreed to finance Bernard Sunley's property development programme by making &pound;12 million available over a five-year period, to be secured by a twenty-year first mortgage debenture stock. At the same time Eagle Star purchased &pound;4 million of Bernard Sunley Investment Trust's shares&#151;one third of the company's equity&#151;from existing shareholders. Eagle Star's chairman, Sir Brian Mountain, and one of its assistant general managers, H. J. A. Harbour, joined the company's board as part of this agreement.<br>
<br>Sunley ranked alongside the most successful property developers of the 1950s property boom; Bernard Sunley Investment Trust had assets of &pound;33 million at the time of his death in 1964. While he is said to have become carried away by success towards the end of his life  (Marriott, 38), Sunley remained proud of his working-class origins and was happy to recall his early days working as a muck shifter with his father. Edward Erdman recalled Sunley as &#145;a rumbustious character. Blunt and with little regard for convention&#146;  (Erdman, 120).<br>
<br>Sunley's recreations included golf, swimming, and horse-racing. One of his horses, Slippery Serpent, started as third favourite in the 1959 Grand National, but fell at the thirteenth fence and had to be destroyed. In addition to his property development activities, Sunley also served as a director of the Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company (Bahamas) Ltd, from 1961, and as a member of the council of the Royal Society of St George. He was also well known for his many gifts to charity, and donated about &pound;500,000 in the year before his death. The beneficiaries included a number of Oxford colleges.<br>
<br>Bernard Sunley suffered from obesity and hypertension and died of a heart attack at his home, 26 Harley Road, Hampstead, on 20 November 1964, at the age of fifty-four. Bernard Sunley Investment Trust was eventually taken over by Eagle Star in 1979, following an earlier bid in 1973 which was thwarted by referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the 1973&#150;4 property crash. Sunley's personal estate was worth at least &pound;5 million at the time of his death. Although Sunley's will stipulated that no funeral or committal or memorial service be held, a sum of up to &pound;3500 was provided for a banquet to be held at Claridge's Hotel for his employees and business friends.<br>
