<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Odger,  George</span>  (1813&#150;1877), <span class="occ">shoemaker and trade unionist</span>, was born in Roborough, south Devon, the son of John Odger, a Cornish miner. After attending the village school, he became a shoemaker at an early age, tramping about the country before settling in London, where he became active in the Ladies' West End Shoemakers' Society. A first-class craftsman, he was the only significant labour leader of his generation to practise his trade throughout his life: his death certificate described him as &#145;Ladies Boot Maker and Public Orator&#146;  (d. cert., 4 March 1877). Odger, who rose to prominence in delegate meetings of London trades to support building workers in the 1859 strike and lock-out, helped to initiate the London Trades Council, succeeding George Howell as secretary in 1862 and serving in that capacity until 1872.<br>
<br>With the London Trades Council as his organizational base, Odger, who never held office in his trade union, promoted the cause of parliamentary suffrage through the Manhood Suffrage and Vote by Ballot Association, of which he became the chairman in 1862. Odger was instrumental in persuading the labour newspaper <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> to reverse its pro-Confederate position in the American Civil War and spoke at a meeting held at St James's Hall on 26 March 1863 in support of the Unionist cause. He was also involved in the popular welcome to Garibaldi and in meetings to express sympathy with the Polish revolt in 1863. His fraternal address to French workers in December 1863, following a French deputation over the Polish question, was a precursor of the International Working Men's Association, established in September 1864; Odger became president and subsequently chairman of its council. His influence within the First International, like that of other British workers, proved transitory, and he resigned in June 1871 in protest against the promulgation of Karl Marx's socialist interpretation of the Paris Commune.<br>
<br>An opponent of George Potter's management of <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span>, Odger transformed the <span class="italic">Workman's Advocate</span> (later <span class="italic">Commonwealth</span>) into the organ of the International and of the Reform League. Serving as editor of <span class="italic">Commonwealth</span> in 1866&#150;7, he voiced support for manhood suffrage, land redistribution, reduction of hours of work, and legal protection of trade unions. He was employed as a paid lecturer for the Reform League in 1866 and an election organizer in 1868, canvassing on behalf of the Liberal Party in Devon and Cornwall. In 1867 Odger became a member of the Conference of Amalgamated Trades formed by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/61765', "junta")</script> of amalgamated union leaders to articulate the case for legalization, and was a member of the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress in 1871 and in 1873&#150;4.<br>
<br>On five occasions Odger contested parliamentary seats, but his candidacy was invariably blocked by the official Liberals. In Chelsea (1868) he was obliged to withdraw when an arbitration committee decided in favour of another Liberal candidate. In Stafford (1869), despite local support, he withdrew after coming third in a test ballot, and in Bristol (1870) he retired rather than split the Liberal vote. In Southwark (1870) Odger went to the poll, losing to the Conservative by only 304 votes after Sir Sidney Waterlow declined to withdraw. Four years later Odger, opposed again by both Liberals and Conservatives, came third in the Southwark contest.<br>
<br>During the early 1870s Odger flirted with republicanism and endorsed the Land and Labour League's advocacy of land nationalism. More radical than contemporaries like George Howell and Robert Applegarth, he was never a socialist or a revolutionary, believing that working-class advance could be achieved only by legitimate political and industrial means. A brilliant orator, effective in parliamentary deputations, he was a popular leader but lacked the capacity for sustained administrative tasks.<br>
<br>Odger died from congestion of the lungs on 4 March 1877, survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter. His funeral on 10 March followed a procession of London workers to Brompton cemetery, where eulogies were delivered by Professor E. S. Beesly and Henry Fawcett MP.<br>
