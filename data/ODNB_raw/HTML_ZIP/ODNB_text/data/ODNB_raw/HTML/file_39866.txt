<span class="headword">Cousins,  Frank</span>  (1904&#150;1986), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 8 September 1904 at 28 Minerva Street, Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, the eldest son in a family of ten (five sons and five daughters) of Charles Fox Cousins, miner, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, the daughter of a miner from Bulwell. He was educated at Beckett Road School in Wheatley, Doncaster, and King Edward elementary school, Doncaster, which he left at the age of fourteen in 1918 shortly before the end of the First World War. He immediately started work alongside his father, as a trainee at Brodsworth colliery in Doncaster, where he worked underground and joined the mineworkers' union (then the Yorkshire Miners' Association, which was part of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, the forerunner of the National Union of Mineworkers). After working in the colliery for more than five years Cousins left to become a truck driver, first delivering coal locally and then, in 1931, as a long-distance road haulage driver&#151;by which time he had joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), led by Ernest Bevin. Meanwhile, on 26 December 1930 he married Annie Elizabeth 
    (Nance; <i>b</i>. 1907)
  , daughter of Percy Judd, railway clerk, of Doncaster. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>Cousins mostly ferried meat between Scotland and London until July 1938, when he became a full-time official of the TGWU, as an organizer in the Doncaster district. In one sense he was born into trade unionism as were so many of his generation&#151;men of great natural ability but without extended education or social opportunities open to the more prosperous groups in society. Becoming a trade union activist was a calling, quite the equal of similarly dedicated work for a political party. At this time Cousins first met Ernest Bevin, clashing with him over organizing road haulage workers into the union. It was a brotherly clash, but one which both men remembered, and especially Cousins, since he felt it may have been a turning point in his own career, demonstrating as it did his characteristic style as a fearless, stubborn, awkward, and rebellious negotiator. His physical stature helped to accentuate these characteristics: he was 6 feet 4 inches tall, powerfully built, and immensely strong. He spoke with a sharp rasping tone, especially when excited by events. His loyalty to his principles and political beliefs was absolute.<br>
<br>Cousins's development as a full-time official for the TGWU took him from Doncaster to Sheffield during the Second World War. In 1944 he was appointed to his first national trade union post, as national officer for the road haulage section of the TGWU, based in London. In October 1948 he was appointed national secretary for the group, a substantial achievement in view of his difficult relationship with the TGWU general secretary, Arthur Deakin, with whom he had frequently clashed, on industrial as well as political policy. Deakin, a rock of the established right-wing authority of the trade union movement, sought to keep Cousins firmly under control and, where possible, deny him advancement in the union. But a series of remarkable circumstances thrust Cousins into the top ranks of the TGWU.<br>
<br>Deakin died in 1955 before he could secure his preferred successor. The job of general secretary of the TGWU, arguably the most important power-broking role in the British labour movement, then went to Deakin's number two, Arthur Tiffin, and to everyone's surprise Cousins was appointed by the union's executive as Tiffin's deputy. Tiffin died unexpectedly within six months of taking over and on 2 January 1956 Cousins was appointed &#145;acting&#146; general secretary. Later, on 11 May 1956, after a union ballot, he was confirmed as general secretary by 503,560 votes to 77,916&#151;which was the largest ballot return in the history of any British trade union. At that time the union ran membership ballots only for the general secretary's post.<br>
<br>The whole affair was an extraordinary sequence of events, which was to have far-reaching consequences for the entire labour movement&#151;especially for the Labour Party, then under the leadership of Hugh Gaitskell. The largest union in the country had a left-wing radical at the helm for the first time in its history. Cousins immediately made an impact on the industrial front, first in the motor industry, where he inherited a difficult and tense climate of industrial relations as automation was being introduced, and then in London buses, where he led a strike lasting nearly two months. At the same time he quickly sought to switch the TGWU's traditional political stance from staunchly pro-Gaitskell to the support of Aneurin Bevan and the Bevanite left. In fact he went beyond this and personally associated himself and his family with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In 1960 Cousins led the campaign to &#145;ban the bomb&#146; at the Labour Party conference at which Gaitskell was defeated on defence policy. The defeat precipitated Gaitskell's famous &#145;fight and fight, and fight again&#146; speech.<br>
<br>After Gaitskell's death in 1963 Cousins played a prominent part in helping to secure Harold Wilson as leader of the Labour Party. In October 1964, when Wilson won the general election, Cousins was invited into the Labour cabinet as the first minister of technology. At the same time he was sworn of the privy council. Yet the rebellious instinct refused to desert him even in the cabinet. He quickly found himself at odds with Wilson, as he opposed all moves by the Wilson government to establish a statutory incomes policy. When, in the end, he failed to persuade his cabinet colleagues, he resigned from the Wilson government in July 1966. Shortly afterwards he also resigned his parliamentary seat at Nuneaton&#151;a seat that had been found for him in a by-election in 1964 and which he assumed in January 1965.<br>
<br>Cousins consistently resisted any form of state control over pay, carrying this opposition back with him to the TGWU where, after resigning from the government, he resumed as general secretary in 1966. Yet he never again quite recaptured the force of his earlier years. However, during the three years which remained before he retired from the TGWU in September 1969, he ensured the succession of his chosen &#145;crown prince&#146;, Jack Jones.<br>
<br>Cousins's final role was as the founding chairman of the Community Relations Commission, set up in 1968 by the Wilson government, and charged with improving race relations in Britain. It was a cause close to Cousins's heart&#151;so much so that he remained in the post for a short while even after the election of a Conservative government under Edward Heath in 1970. Indeed, he was persuaded to do so by the home secretary, Reginald Maudling. In November 1970 he finally resigned his chairmanship of the commission and went into retirement in the village of Wrington near Bristol, curiously enough only a few miles from where the founder of the TGWU, Ernest Bevin, was born. He refused several invitations to return to public life and declined a seat in the House of Lords. He died at the Royal Hospital, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, on 11 June 1986, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife and four children. His ashes were scattered across moorland near Chesterfield, and a memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 9 July 1986.<br>
<br>Cousins was the most forceful of all trade union leaders to emerge in the post-war years: he had a remarkable and galvanizing effect on the rank and file of the entire labour movement. He shifted the Labour Party and the trade union movement to the left and turned the Transport and General Workers' Union&#151;then the largest union in the country&#151;from a pillar of the Labour right-wing establishment into a driving force for radical left-wing reform.<br>
<br>The reasons behind Cousins's remarkable, albeit temporary, success went beyond his own forceful, commanding personality&#151;he emerged on the trade union and political scene at a psychologically important moment in the post-war development of organized labour. By the mid-1950s a good deal of disillusion had set in to dampen the idealism of the immediate post-war years. The Attlee government's loss of office in 1951 led to a widespread conflict of ideas as to what kind of socialist programme should be adopted to appeal to the British voters. The split inside the Labour Party between right and left wing was sharper than ever, with the Gaitskellites and the Bevanites engaged in ideological warfare. Before Cousins the trade union majority within the TUC was solidly Gaitskellite. Cousins changed that balance and in the process began an ideological debate within the entire labour movement about the direction of a future Labour government. His eventual alliance with Harold Wilson&#151;whom he decisively helped into the leadership of the party&#151;was expected to be similar to the kind of alliance that Bevin had with Attlee in the 1945 Labour government. But that did not happen. The realities were conditioned by Labour's extremely narrow majority in the 1964 election, by disagreement within the Wilson cabinet, and by Cousins's own impatience. He wanted to push ahead with radical policies, not only in his own new Ministry of Technology, but also for the government as a whole. One example was his deep disagreement with Wilson's foreign policy, especially Britain's political support for the Americans in Vietnam. These factors, along with his refusal to accept a policy of wage restraint, led to his resignation from the government.<br>
<br>As a cabinet minister, at the pioneering technology department, Cousins was a failure&#151;like so many &#145;imports&#146; from industry. He did succeed in launching a number of important developments at the new ministry but his style in the Commons was too abrasive. He privately confessed to feeling ill at ease in the parliamentary ambience. The launching and development of a completely new department of state is, by definition, a formidable task; it requires experienced political skills which Cousins, the combative trade union leader, did not possess. Nor did he get the response he had hoped for from his cabinet colleagues&#151;some of whom still resented the thrust of his political ideas.<br>
