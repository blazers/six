<span class="headword">Barnett, Sir  Denis Hensley Fulton</span>  (1906&#150;1992), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 11 February 1906, son of Sir Louis Edward Barnett CMG (<i>d</i>. 1946), a surgeon, and his wife, Mabel Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fulton. He was educated at Christ's College, Christchurch, New Zealand, and Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1929, proceeding MA in 1935.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Barnett learnt to fly with the university air squadron and was commissioned into the RAF officer reserve. He received a permanent commission in the RAF in 1929, rising to the rank of flight lieutenant by 1934. In these early years he had periods as an instructor and had some experience of what was then the fledgeling art of army co-operation. By the late 1930s, however, he was committed to bombers, and in 1938 was placed in command of 84 squadron, which operated antiquated Vickers Vincent biplanes from Shaybah, Iraq. On 22 April 1939 Barnett married Pamela (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), daughter of the late Sir Allen John Grant, engineer, at Christchurch, Sheffield. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Throughout the Second World War Barnett served with Bomber Command. With the fall of France in 1940 he was given command of 40 squadron of Blenheim bombers and ordered to attack German shipping in the Channel ports where amphibious forces were being assembled for an invasion of Britain. These planes lacked any real punch in terms of bomb load, were lightly armed, and had a low top speed which made them easy prey to enemy fighters. Faced with a difficult and dangerous task, Barnett and his crews nevertheless made a series of courageous raids whose nuisance value, if not material destruction, was considerable. His leadership in these operations earned him the DFC in 1940.<br>
<br>Barnett was promoted to group captain in 1941 and for the remainder of the war commanded bomber stations and a bomber group, subsequently occupying the posts of deputy director, bomber operations, Air Ministry (1944), and senior air staff officer, Bomber Command headquarters (1945). Promoted to air commodore in 1945, he served as director of air operations, Air Ministry, until 1946 before joining the air staff in India (1946&#150;7). Periods of service with the Staff College, Camberley (1948), and central bomber establishment followed.<br>
<br>With the Malayan emergency of the early 1950s Barnett once more found himself organizing bombing operations with outdated aircraft, in this case the Avro Lincoln, a lumbering, piston-driven, four-engine bomber that made little impact against an enemy hiding in thick jungle. By contrast, at the time of the Suez crisis Barnett, who had risen to the rank of air vice-marshal in 1953, was placed in command of allied air task force, Near East, where an all-jet bomber force was at his disposal. When the Anglo-French offensive began on 31 October 1956, Valiant and Canberra bombers, together with the Royal Navy's carrier-borne aircraft, virtually annihilated the Egyptian air force on the ground within forty-eight hours. This action paved the way for the invasion which went ahead untroubled by Egyptian air attacks: a result that was a tribute to Barnett's ability to organize and utilize the precise capabilities of aircraft available to him.<br>
<br>Thereafter Barnett's career flourished. Promoted to air marshal in 1959 and air chief marshal in 1962, he held the posts of commandant, RAF staff college, Bracknell (1956); air secretary, Air Ministry (1957&#150;9); air officer commanding-in-chief, RAF Transport Command (1959&#150;62); and air officer commanding-in-chief, RAF Near East (1962&#150;4). In this last and final position, he was responsible for British forces in Cyprus and the administration of the sovereign base areas.<br>
<br>In retirement Barnett was a full-time member of the Atomic Energy Commission with special responsibility for weapons research and development (1965&#150;72). A quiet man who enjoyed fishing in his spare time, his leadership was thoughtful rather than fiery. Yet beneath a modest exterior was a person of great personal bravery with a capacity for outstanding tactical analysis. Barnett was made CBE (1945), CB (1956), KCB (1957), and GCB (1964). In addition, he was appointed commander, US Legion of Merit (1954) and awarded the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur (commandeur) and Croix de Guerre (1958).<br>
<br>Barnett died at his home, River House, Rushall, Pewsey, Wiltshire, of coronary thrombosis on 31 December 1992. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
