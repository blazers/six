<span class="headword">Adler,  Jacob</span>  (1855&#150;1926), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 1 January 1855 in Odessa, Ukraine, the son of Feivl Abramovich, an Orthodox Jewish wheat merchant, and his wife, Hesye. Of the twelve children of Hesye and Feivl (she had one son with her first husband, whom she divorced), only Jacob and a younger sister, Sarah, survived infancy.<br>
<br>Jacob's parents had ambitious plans for him, hoping that with his quick mind he would become a doctor. Schooling did not agree with him, however, and he eventually left to earn his own living. With abundant charisma and beautiful handwriting, he advanced rapidly through a series of clerical and civil-service positions, culminating in a prestigious job as municipal overseer of weights and measures. His solid income allowed him to live the life of the bon vivant; he dressed like a dandy, caroused until the wee hours, and frequently attended the Russian theatre. There he became the leader of a claque that supported a popular local actress, and was bitten hard by the theatrical bug.<br>
<br>When Adler learned that a Yiddish company led by Avrom Goldfaden was active in Bucharest, he extended an invitation to them to visit Odessa, and in 1879 they did so. Adler became an extra in the company and travelled with them to Kherson, thereby staying away from his office job so long that he was fired. Intentionally or not, he virtually forced himself into becoming a professional actor.<br>
<br>Adler toured extensively with the Yiddish troupe, soon making his way to more important roles in such plays as Goldfaden's <span class="italic">Brayndele kozak</span> and <span class="italic">Shmendrik</span>. During one of these early tours, in Yekaterinoslav, he met and married Sofia (Sonya) Oberlender. In 1882 Adler joined the throng of Jews fleeing Russia in the wake of worsening conditions after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. Adler settled for several years in London, where he and Sonya were among the pioneers who established Yiddish theatre in the East End. Sonya died in 1885. They had two children: Rivke, who died at age three, and Abe, who, like many of the Adler children by four different mothers, became an actor himself. At about the same time, another child was born to Adler out of wedlock, when Jenny Kaiser gave birth to a son named Charlie, who took his father's last name.<br>
<br>Shortly after Sonya's premature death, Jacob married an actress named Dina Stettin, who became an international star, primarily as Dina Feinman, after her divorce from Adler a few years later and her marriage to leading man Sigmund Feinman. Adler and Dina had one daughter, Celia, who also became a major star.<br>
<br>Adler was part of the original troupe at the Prince's Club Theatre in London, where in 1887 a false fire alarm created a stampede, leading to the deaths of seventeen in the audience. At least partly in response to the tragedy, Adler soon left London for the United States. Initially bypassing New York, the hub of the American Yiddish theatre, he worked for a short time in Chicago, then returned to Europe, where he spent two years performing in Warsaw. In 1889 he passed through London again before being invited to perform in New York, where he spent most of the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Adler formed his two most lasting partnerships shortly after arriving in New York. He had fallen in love with actress Sara Heimovich-Heine (<i>c</i>.1858&#150;1953), who was married at the time to actor Maurice Heine. In 1891 he and Sara both obtained divorces in order to marry each other. As a couple and as individuals they became theatrical royalty, and most of their children became professional actors as well. Frances and Julia had successful careers on the Yiddish stage; Stella and Luther crossed over into the American (English-language) stage with great success; and Stella made an indelible impact on American acting with her actor training programme.<br>
<br>The other crucial partnership in Adler's career&#151;a symbiotic professional relationship that transformed the development of the Yiddish theatre&#151;was his involvement with playwright Jacob Gordin. Missing from Adler's many talents as a performer was a good singing voice, which often seriously limited a repertoire dominated by operettas and musical comedies. Adler's salvation as a leading man came in the form of Gordin, a Russian intellectual who, shortly after immigrating to New York in 1891, met Adler and other Yiddish actors and was inspired to write plays for the first time. Gordin's first effort, later that same year, was <span class="italic">Siberia</span> (1891), which audiences reportedly resisted until Adler won them over through sheer force of personality. Gordin went on to write several more leading roles that became among Adler's best-known creations, including the title characters <span class="italic">Der yidisher kenig Lir</span> (&#145;The Jewish King Lear&#146;) and <span class="italic">Der vilder mentsh</span> (&#145;The Wild Man&#146;), and <span class="italic">Elisha Ben Abuye</span>. So effective was Adler as Dovid Moysheles, the contemporary Russian Jewish version of King Lear, that he was deluged with letters from parents thanking him for making their Shloymes and Moyshes better children.<br>
<br>The late 1890s and beginning of the 1900s brought Adler's creative peak, with talented playwrights like Gordin, Leon Kobrin, and David Pinski writing for him. He also attracted attention outside the Jewish quarter with his portrayal in 1901 of Shylock, modelled closely on Henry Irving's sympathetic reading of the role. The production attracted, among others, prominent producers like Daniel Frohman, who mounted a Broadway production two years later with Adler playing Shylock in Yiddish, and an English-speaking supporting cast. The production was a critical as well as a commercial success, and Adler reprised the role on Broadway in 1905.<br>
<br>An aged and feeble Adler gave his last performance in 1925, and died of a stroke on 31 March 1926 in New York city. The following day tens of thousands of onlookers lined the streets of New York to pay their last respects as his body was carried to its final resting place in Mount Carmel cemetery.<br>
