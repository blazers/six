<span class="headword">Chapman <span class="st"> [Barker]</span>,  Edmund</span>  (1537/8&#150;1602), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, probably hailed from the family named Chapman or Barker long established in Sibton, Suffolk. He matriculated as a sizar from Gonville Hall, Cambridge, in November 1554, graduating BA from Trinity in 1559; appointed a fellow in 1560, he proceeded MA in 1562. Thus Garrett's identification of him with the Marian exile from Hastings who was living in Aarau with a wife and child in 1558 must be discounted; it was perhaps that man who was rector of Marsham, Norfolk, from 1559 to 1576.<br>
<br>Chapman was ordained deacon at Norwich on 8 June 1566. Appointed university preacher the following year, he was granted the degree of BD in 1569. On 16 March 1570, at the petition of the master of Trinity and future archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, Chapman received letters patent from the lord keeper, Nicholas Bacon, as canon of the first prebend in Norwich Cathedral. He then emerged as an active supporter of Thomas Cartwright, who that year launched the presbyterian campaign for further reform of the Church of England in his lectures as Lady Margaret professor at Cambridge. Chapman preached against pluralism, and with other members of the chapter broke into Norwich Cathedral and destroyed the organ. At about this time he married Susan, sister of William Cardinal of Great Bromley, Essex, a wealthy lawyer and former MP.<br>
<br>As town preacher at Bedford in 1572 Chapman was suspended by Thomas Cooper, bishop of Lincoln, for contentious sermons. An oblique reference to this matter by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, has led to the assumption, unsupported by the Norwich chapter acts, that he was also deprived of his prebend for nonconformity. It seems more likely that he eventually resigned because it did not provide an adequate income. On 12 April 1574 George Gardiner, dean of Norwich, urged Bishop John Parkhurst to &#145;travail&#146; with him &#145;that he may stay upon his prebend and [have] some other help in Norwich&#146;  (Houlbrooke, 239). Chapman was still in residence on 3 January 1575, when Parkhurst noted with displeasure that he and others had inveighed against singing in the cathedral during the Christmas season.<br>
<br>Perhaps Chapman finally quitted Norwich after the arrival of Edmund Freake as bishop in November 1575. In 1577 John Aylmer, bishop of London, told Lord Burghley that, like John Field and others, he was preaching &#145;God knows what&#146; in private houses  (Strype, 36&#150;7). Later that year he gravitated to Dedham, Essex, where William Cardinal endowed a lectureship for him. Although no preacher was listed there during Aylmer's primary visitation of London diocese in July, Chapman was licensed to preach throughout Essex on 2 November. The foundation of the lectureship may thus be dated to the autumn of 1577.<br>
<br>Chapman was incorporated BD and DD at Oxford on 7 and 10 July 1578. In October 1582 he was chief organizer of the Dedham classis, the only clerical conference active during the 1580s whose records survive, and remained its presiding intellect until it ceased to meet in June 1589. Throughout these years he remained on close terms with Cartwright and with Field, the co-ordinator of the conference movement. Letters to the former and from the latter survive among the Dedham papers.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1583 Chapman asked the conference's advice about publishing a short catechism, the brethren having &#145;perused and allowed&#146; its doctrine  (Usher, 28). His only known work, it appeared anonymously the same year as <span class="italic">A Catechisme with a Prayer Annexed, Meete for All Christian Families</span>, the prayer being followed by the initials &#145;E. C.&#146;. It enshrines the proposition that true faith in God is implanted &#145;by no other means but by the preaching of his holy word&#146;  (sig. A6<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Despite his earlier iconoclasm, Chapman's level-headed superintendency at Dedham belies the claim of its contemporary opponents that the movement was led only by irresponsible hot-heads. He frequently urged restraint and moderation on less temperate colleagues, and perhaps for that reason seldom clashed with Bishop Aylmer. He nevertheless suffered a period of suspension after the episcopal visitation of 1586, and again in 1588, because during a visit to Fulham in March he refused to assist Aylmer in conducting an ordination in the chapel. Even so, he was not one of those leaders of the movement examined or prosecuted between 1589 and 1592 for their clandestine activities.<br>
<br>By the terms of William Cardinal's will in January 1596 Chapman received substantial property in Great Bromley as long as he retained the lectureship. By his own, dated 12 May 1601, he bequeathed half his goods and all his property in Dedham and nearby Ardleigh to his wife. Their son Paul, still a minor, was to inherit after her death. Bequests to their second son, John, included a property in Bread Street, London. Their daughter Susan received &pound;200 at marriage or majority. Another daughter, Chrispian, is mentioned only in the codicil. There were bequests to his brother Nicholas, to Nicholas's sons Thomas and Edmund, and to a nephew named Dannocke. No member of the former Dedham conference was remembered.<br>
<br>Chapman died on 7 November 1602, aged sixty-four, and was buried at Dedham church on 8 or 9 November. Two of the three executors he nominated renounced executorship. Letters of administration were therefore issued to the third, Simon Fenn, clothier of Dedham, on 10 February 1603. Both Chapman's gravestone and funeral monument survive, and were described in print by Canon Rendall, the last independent lecturer of Dedham. Two letters to John Reynolds, dated 1601, are preserved at Corpus Christi College, Oxford  (MS 303, fol. 200). The Dedham lectureship still exists, but by an order in council of 1908 was officially vested in the incumbent vicar of Dedham, following the death of Canon Rendall in 1938.<br>
