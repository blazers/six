<span class="headword">Wall,  John</span>  (1588&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born into a gentry family in Holborn, Middlesex, and educated at Westminster School. Having matriculated at Oxford from Christ Church in 1604, he graduated BA in 1608 and proceeded MA in 1611. Appointed rector of St Aldates, Oxford, in 1617, he gained his BD and licence to preach in 1618 and his DD in 1623.<br>
<br>Wall gained wide recognition as a preacher. In the 1620s he published several sermons dedicated to members of the Berkeley and Stanhope families and to Bishop Williams of Lincoln, the &#145;lord and patron of my studies and fortunes&#146;  (Wall, <span class="italic">Apollos</span>), who in turn described Wall as &#145;the best read in the fathers of any he ever knew&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.734). Exhibiting a combination of learning, sycophancy, and high-flown language, Wall's sermons are characterized by Christocentricity and by a scorn of separatists and of Roman Catholics, the &#145;bloudie instruments of voluntarie penance&#146;  (J. Wall, <span class="italic">Alae seraphicae: the Seraphins Wings to Raise Us to Heaven</span>, 1627). About this time he was chaplain to Philip Stanhope, first earl of Chesterfield, at whose Shelford seat he preached <span class="italic">Christ in Progresse</span> (1627) and <span class="italic">The Lion in the Lambe, or, Strength in Weaknes</span> (1628).<br>
<br>Preferment followed as Wall was made a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1632, vicar of Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, in 1637, and a canon of Salisbury in 1644. Deprived of his canonry at Christ Church by the parliamentary visitors in March 1648, in September he was the sole member of the chapter to be restored following a submission apparently given with &#145;reluctance&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">History</span>, 4.811&#150;12). Remaining at Christ Church through the 1640s and 1650s, he became subdean and moderator, and in <span class="italic">Ramus olivae</span>, preached in the university church in 1653, hailed Oliver Cromwell, the dedicatee, as &#145;most invincible leader of the troops of &hellip; Britain and Ireland &hellip; most honorable chancellor of the academy of Oxford &hellip; [and] most extraordinary propagator of arts and sciences&#146;; just as Alexander the Great had civilized the barbarians, so the campaigning Cromwell had brought the people to the true faith and recognition of Jesus. However, by 1658 Wall had experienced some disillusionment: <span class="italic">Christian Reconcilement</span>, while celebrating the peace Christ had obtained, regretted that &#145;we should live to make debate among our selves, striving and struggling, like Jacob and Esau in the wombe, and bowels of Church and Country, not as true Israelites, but as vaine Ishmaelites&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Reconcilement</span>, 1658, 18).<br>
<br>Wall publicly welcomed the Restoration with a sermon in the university church on 1 May, <span class="italic">Solomon in solio</span> (1660), and asserted in dedicating <span class="italic">A Divine Theater, or, A Stage for Christians</span> (1662) to Bishop George Morley, lately dean of Christ Church, that he had &#145;wept for joy&#146; when he read Morley's coronation sermon, &#145;perform'd, to the &hellip; Gracious settlement of Church and State in their Ancient and Fundamentall Government and Splendour, the continuance whereof I do heartily pray for&#146;. According to Anthony Wood's account, however, he was unpopular with his newly installed colleagues and with students because of insufficient loyalty to Christ Church and excessive generosity towards the town of Oxford. Although he subscribed to the college's rebuilding in 1660, it was to Pembroke College that he willed his &#145;Great <span class="roman">Bible</span> &hellip; in severall languages&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/322, fol. 257), and the &pound;100 left to the poor of Holborn on his death was apparently on top of much larger donations during the last years of his life to the poor of Oxford. Friends and executors Dr Sebastian Smith of Christ Church and Richard Croke of Marston, city recorder, did not, as Wood claimed, receive &#145;an incredible mass of money that he had hid&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 2.91)&#151;they in fact received &pound;100 each&#151;but Croke, a leading local parliamentarian during the civil war, was deeply distrusted by many in the university, and the association would not have helped Wall. After he died, unmarried, at Christ Church on 20 October 1666, none of his colleagues, Wood asserted, joined the funeral procession to the cathedral, where he was buried.<br>
