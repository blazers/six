<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woodroffe, Sir  John George</span>  (1865&#150;1936), <span class="occ">judge and tantric scholar</span>, was born on 15 December 1865, the eldest son of James Tisdall Woodroffe, a lawyer, and his wife, Florence Hume. After completing his schooling in Woburn Park School, Surrey, he studied at University College, Oxford, and was awarded a second-class degree in jurisprudence. In 1889 he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple.<br>
<br>Like his father, who had been the advocate-general of Bengal and legal member of the government of India, Woodroffe opted to serve in India and enrolled as an advocate in the Calcutta high court in 1890. His contribution to enriching legal knowledge in India was aptly acknowledged when Calcutta University elected him the Tagore law professor for 1896&#150;7 and made him a fellow. The government of India appointed him as the standing counsel in 1902. He was elevated to the bench of the Calcutta high court in 1904, and he held the high office with distinction for the next eighteen years. In 1905 Woodroffe married Ellen Elizabeth, daughter of S. D. Grimson; they had a son and a daughter. In 1915 he became the chief justice of Bengal and was knighted. After retiring from the judicial service in 1923, he served as reader in Indian law for seven years at Oxford University.<br>
<br>Woodroffe wrote a number of authoritative legal texts on civil and criminal law. With the Indian jurist Ameer Ali he compiled <span class="italic">Law of Evidence Applicable to British India</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Civil Procedure in British India: a Commentary on Act V of 1908</span> (1908). Based on S. L. Phipson's <span class="italic">Law of Evidence</span>, the former contained both explications of clauses of the <span class="roman">Indian Evidence Act</span> and commentaries on it. Sir John's <span class="italic">Criminal procedure in British India (being a commentary on Act V of 1898 as amended up to date)</span> (1926) was an impressive treatise on both procedural and substantive criminal law in British India. His Tagore law lectures, published as <span class="italic">The Law Relating to Receivers in British India</span> (1900) and <span class="italic">The Law Relating to Injunctions in British India</span> (1919), long remained standard reference works.<br>
<br>Like William Jones, Sir John had an abiding interest in promoting oriental learning. With an unusual mastery of Sanskrit he enriched the understanding of Hindu philosophy, especially the Shakta school of thought which believes in the worship of the divine power (Mahashakti) as the Great Mother Mahadevi of the universe. Many of his commentaries on Tantra, a branch of the Shakta philosophy, were published under the pseudonym Arthur Avalon. In <span class="italic">Shakti and Shakta: Essays and Addresses on the Shakta Tantrashastra</span> (1918) he demonstrated that Shaktaism was neither irrational nor obscurantist. Sir John claimed this work to be Shakta doctrine's first British account from an Indian standpoint. In <span class="italic">Mahamaya: the World as Power: Power as Consciousness</span> (1929) Sir John joined co-author Pramatha Natha Mukkhayopadhyay to show how the doctrine of Shakti offered an alternative conception of consciousness to western philosophy. He criticized the &#145;racial and credal bias&#146; of those European scholars who used &#145;exaggerated&#146; Christian notions of &#145;universal piety and morals&#146; to characterize Hinduism as &#145;the most puerile, impure and bloody of any system of idolatry&#146;. Instead, in <span class="italic">Principles of Tantra</span>, part 1, in <span class="italic">The Serpent Power</span> (1919), and in the commentaries for the <span class="roman">Tantric Text Series</span>, he underlined Tantra as &#145;the great Mantra and Sadhana Shastra (Scripture)&#146; wherein lay the source of fundamental concepts concerning &#145;worship, images, initiation, yoga&#146;. In his foreword to <span class="italic">The Tibetan Book of the Dead</span> (1927) Woodroffe explained the science of death in the context of Tibetan Mahyana Buddhism. His <span class="italic">The Garland of Letters</span> (1922) was an interesting collection of studies in Mantra-Shastra, a term commonly applied to Tantra-Shastra.<br>
<br>Sir John sought oriental knowledge to unravel the racial, religious, and political presuppositions that underlay Britain's cultural conquest of India. Like many orientalists he exposed the basic fallacies within European critique of Indian culture written from a &#145;rationalist&#146; standpoint. He juxtaposed western materialism to Indian spiritualism, but was confident that the Indian spirit, shaped by ideas and instincts of thousands of years, would assert themselves. Not unnaturally, a work by Kathleen Taylor, <span class="italic">Sir John Woodroffe, Tantra and Bengal</span> (2001), has described Sir John in its subtitle as &#145;an Indian soul in a European body&#146;. But it is doubtful if he could impress upon the English audience his positive impressions of Indian civilization; for &#145;most hearers found it difficult to follow him in the bewildering mazes of the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). However, Woodroffe's glorification of Indian spiritualism was itself a part of the colonial sociology of knowledge. His characterization of the Indian civilization as essentially spiritual and primarily Hindu  (Woodroffe, xii) undermined both the material and eclectic aspects of Indian culture.<br>
<br>Sir John Woodroffe died on 16 January 1936 at the Villa Aurelia, boulevard du Tenas, Beausoleil, Alpes Maritimes, France. He was survived by his wife.<br>
