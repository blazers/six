<span class="headword">Seton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1359/60), <span class="occ">justice</span>, probably came from one of the northern counties where the place name Seton or Seaton is common, and where much of his legal work was done. Though his origins and private life remain obscure, it is known that his wife was called Isabel and that they had a son called William. First recorded in 1340 as serving on an oyer and terminer commission investigating official misconduct in Cumberland and Westmorland, from Michaelmas term 1342 Seton appears as a serjeant-at-law in both the year-books and the records of the common bench. He held the office of king's serjeant from 1343 to 1345, and in June 1345 appeared before the king's council on behalf of the commonalty of the bishopric of Durham, asking for the remission of an eyre in return for a payment of 600 marks. A record from 1351 terms him Sir Thomas, but there is no firm evidence that he was knighted.<br>
<br>He was appointed a justice of the king's bench at Easter 1354, but on 12 October of the following year was moved to the common bench (having, however, enjoyed the higher salary paid to justices of the latter court even while on the king's bench). He served on the common bench until Trinity 1359, and on 5 July 1357, he was made a justice of the king's bench again, &#145;for this turn&#146;. Just before his death he was said to be a member of the king's secret council. Edward, the Black Prince, also employed him in a legal capacity as a serjeant-pleader, and also as a member of his council. Periodic evidence of this service appears between 1347 and 1358, and he received robes and 50<i>s</i>. annually from the prince.<br>
<br>Seton sat on scores of oyer and terminer commissions and commissions of the peace. Many of these commissions involved issues of public order in the northern counties (Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland), such as the conflict between the garrison and civil administration at Carlisle in 1345, an assault on the warden of the Scottish march in October 1351, and in the winter of 1352 trespasses in the towns of Kingston upon Hull and Beverley (where he and his associates quickly filled the gaol and then delivered the prisoners under separate commission).<br>
<br>Seton evidently had enemies. While he was on his way to a council meeting in the exchequer in November 1357, a woman named Lucy, the wife of Robert Cokeside, loudly denounced him as a faithless traitor who deserved to be drawn and hanged. Seton secured her conviction and won damages of 100 marks. Yet only a few years later, in the summer of 1359, his enemies&#151;&#145;satellites of the devil&#146; the court termed them  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1358&#150;61</i>, 280)&#151;hired a chaplain, Thomas Nesebit, who gained entrance to Seton's dwelling on Fleet Street and then stuck a knife into his belly. Seton had died by May 1360, almost certainly as a consequence of this assault.<br>
