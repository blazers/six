<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wesley,  Charles</span>  (1707&#150;1788), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and a founder of Methodism</span>, was born on 18 December 1707 at Epworth rectory, Lincolnshire, the sixteenth or seventeenth child and third surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29070/', "Samuel Wesley (bap. 1662, d. 1735)")</script>, rector of Epworth, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66878/', "Susanna Wesley (1669&#150;1742)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/566/', "Samuel Annesley")</script> and his second wife, Mary White. Among his elder siblings was Hetty [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38156/', "Wright, Mehetabel")</script>], who later achieved prominence as a poet.<h2>
<a name="Frombirthtoconversion17071738"></a>From birth to conversion, 1707&#150;1738</h2>Wesley was born prematurely, wrapped in soft wool, and opened his eyes and cried only at two months. He was subjected to Susanna's strict and methodical child-rearing, based on subduing the child's will to its parents. Charles entered Westminster School in 1716 where he was overseen by his brother Samuel, one of the ushers, who imbued him with his own high-church tory principles. He became king's scholar (1721) and captain of the school (1725), and protected William Murray (the future lord chief justice the earl of Mansfield), who was persecuted for his family's Jacobite associations. Charles also did some acting, and his lively personality sometimes led him into difficulties. An often repeated story, now thought to be accurate, states that during his schooldays Garrett Wesley of Dangan, co. Meath, Ireland (most probably a relative), offered to make Charles his heir and supported him financially at school. Charles, however, refused the offer and Garrett adopted his cousin Richard Colley, the grandfather of the future duke of Wellington. The claim to a family relationship is almost certainly mistaken. However, the rest of the story first appeared in print in John Whitehead's biography of the Wesleys (1793), citing John Wesley's manuscript biography of Charles, which a letter proves he began in 1788&#151;though it has since disappeared. Charles's daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63664/', "Sarah Wesley")</script> claimed that her father told the story to his friend Lord Mornington, father of Wellington, before Mornington's death in 1781. There is therefore probably real substance to the story.<br>
<br>On 13 June 1726 Wesley matriculated and in 1727 was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford, with a Westminster scholarship of &pound;100 p.a. He graduated BA in 1730 and proceeded MA in March 1733. Freed of family restraints Charles now led a more relaxed life, including excursions to London and emotional entanglements with London actresses. To his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29069/', "John Wesley's")</script> attempts to make him more serious he objected: &#145;What? would you have me to be a saint at once?&#146;  (Moore, 1.151).<br>
<br>But by January 1729 Wesley was prepared to reform:<blockquote>My first year in college I lost in diversion. The next I set myself to study. Diligence led me into serious thinking. I went to the weekly sacrament and persuaded two or three young scholars to accompany me and to resume the method of study prescribed by the statutes of the university. This gained me the harmless nickname of Methodist. (letter to Dr Chandler, 29 April 1785, Methodist church archives, DDWES/1/38)</blockquote>Later that year John Wesley &#145;came to our assistance&#146;  (ibid.). It is on the basis of this letter that Charles is sometimes credited with being the first &#145;Methodist&#146;, though this probably overplays the significance of the term. Charles in 1785 wished to claim that Methodism had been an organization loyal to the church until its betrayal by John Wesley's ordinations of 1784. There is no known contemporary reference to &#145;Methodists&#146; before August 1732, and Charles's informal efforts were systematized by John.<br>
<br>As a student Charles Wesley told John that he was &#145;very <i>desirous</i> of knowledge but can't <i>bear</i> the drudgery of coming at it near so well as you could. &hellip; My head will by no means keep pace with my heart&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Charles Wesley</span>, 12). Like John, he was attracted by the Kirkham circle, centred on John's close friend Sally Kirkham (Varanese), in Stanton, Oxfordshire, Charles's nickname being Araspes; as late as February 1736 he addressed an emotional, self-critical letter to Kirkham. Serious concerns did not stifle Charles's ebullience or jokes about his poverty. John Gambold was told in 1730 about &#145;the whimsical Mr Wesley, his preciousness and pious extravagancies&#146;. He found Charles &#145;a man made for friendship&#146;, vivacious but considerate for a friend's needs, though deferential to his brother who &#145;was always the chief manager&#146;  (Tyerman, <span class="italic">Oxford Methodists</span>, 157). Both brothers were influenced by the nonjurors even, to some extent, after their conversions in 1738.<br>
<br>Wesley was ordained deacon and priest on 5 and 12 October 1735. At this point he &#145;only thought of spending all my days in Oxford. But my brother, who always had the ascendant over me, persuaded me to accompany him and Mr Oglethorpe to Georgia&#146;. Charles's letter also makes clear that John had been instrumental in pushing his brother towards an ordination which he &#145;exceedingly dreaded&#146;  (letter to Chandler, 29 April 1785, Methodist church archives, DDWES/1/38). In Georgia from 1736, Charles acted as secretary to James Edward Oglethorpe. However, designing women and pastoral na&iuml;vety divided the brothers from Oglethorpe by mutual suspicions of misconduct. Despite an emotional reconciliation, Charles was so shattered by physical illness and emotional and spiritual depression that he offered his resignation on 25 July 1736, when Oglethorpe perceptively advised him that, being &#145;of a social temper&#146;, he would find &#145;in a married state the difficulties of working out your salvation exceedingly lessened, and your helps as much increased&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Jackson, 1.35). Charles left for England and after a difficult voyage landed there on 3 December 1736.<br>
<br>Wesley continued to think that he should return to the colony, though as a minister rather than secretary, but finally resigned his Georgia post on 3 April 1738, swayed by medical advice and by his mother's and brother's opposition to his return. Meanwhile he had visited friends, and from July to November 1737 descanted frequently on &#145;the new birth&#146; and &#145;inward change&#146; which affected some of his hearers, reflecting the ideas of the devotional writer William Law. Early in 1738, however, the Moravian Peter B&ouml;hler persuaded the Wesleys to accept the idea of justification by grace through faith, experienced through a sudden conversion. It was Charles who first received the gift, on 21 May, in a way at once less clear-cut and more apparently supernatural than did his brother. Inspired by a mysterious voice (in fact that of a Moravian adherent) &#145;I found myself converted, I knew not how nor when&#146; and &#145;found myself at peace with God and rejoiced in hope of loving Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Jackson, 1.91&#150;2). John's conversion followed on 24 May, and shortly afterwards Charles's poetic gift was released in his &#145;conversion hymn&#146; &#145;When shall my wondering soul begin&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Travellingevangelist17381756"></a>Travelling evangelist, 1738&#150;1756</h2>Wesley's health and temperament seemed poorly fitted for the hardships of a travelling evangelist. A return to Oxford or parish life appeared more suitable options even to his demanding brother. Yet Charles seemed relieved when a prospective living fell through in February 1739. Instead he spent his time in testifying to his new-found faith to individuals and small groups and in preaching. In July 1738 he began what became a lifelong interest by speaking to condemned prisoners at Newgate gaol and achieved startling results despite initial doubts about deathbed repentances. From then until August 1739 he was also an unlicensed curate to George Stonehouse in Islington, finally being forced out by the bishop and churchwardens. On 25 October he began to preach without notes, which gave him greater freedom and made a greater impact upon his hearers; and on 29 May 1739 he followed George Whitefield and John Wesley by preaching in the open air.<br>
<br>Despite his successes Wesley frequently longed for retirement or even death. He was troubled by converts' convulsions and encounters with the French prophets who claimed divine inspiration and healing powers. Though far from denying supernatural influences, Charles became more sceptical than his brother, for he saw some convulsionaries as exhibitionists and put them aside, after which they quietened down. Soon there were also conflicts with Moravians who taught &#145;stillness&#146;, the notion that people must wait passively for God to convert them. Charles, who was more open to mystical impulses than John, may have briefly wavered on the issue. But on 20 July 1740 John Wesley broke with the Moravians and Charles purged the &#145;still brethren&#146; in Bristol. In March 1741 a similar break occurred with the predestinarian followers of George Whitefield in Bristol and London, which provoked Charles to write hymns on the universal offer of salvation. He nevertheless often acted as peacemaker and tried to maintain friendly relations with those estranged by his brother.<br>
<br>At first the Wesleys ministered to their followers by shuttling to and fro between London and Bristol. From 1740 the work expanded to Wales, then northern England, Cornwall, Ireland, and finally, in 1751, to Scotland. Except in Cornwall, John usually preceded Charles. It appears that the general plan was for each brother in turn to attend to London and Bristol while the other visited the more remote areas. Lay preachers filled the gaps between the brothers' visits and met in an annual conference from 1744.<br>
<br>The Methodists often faced mob violence, which provided some of the most dramatic passages in the Wesleys' journals. In the edgy mid-1740s they were suspected of being Jacobites, Charles being cited before the magistrates at Wakefield in March 1744 for praying &#145;that the Lord would call home his [spiritual] banished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Jackson, 1.361). However, he dissuaded John from issuing a declaration of Methodist loyalty which might identify them as a sect.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1747 Charles Wesley first met <a href="#cosubject_63663">Sarah Gwynne [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the twenty-year-old daughter of Marmaduke Gwynne of Garth, Brecknockshire, a magistrate who supported the Methodists. In September 1748 Charles expressed his love plainly in verse:<blockquote>
<div>Two are better far than one<br>
</div>
<div>For counsel or for fight!<br>
</div>
<div>How can one be warm alone<br>
</div>
<div>Or serve his God aright?<br>
</div> (Baker, <span class="italic">Charles Wesley</span>, 58)</blockquote>Fortunately John Wesley supported his brother's suit and was able to satisfy members of the Gwynne family, concerned about Charles's income, by guaranteeing him &pound;100 p.a. from their book profits. Charles had concluded by December that the marriage was indeed God's will for him, and he and Sarah were married at Llanllywenfel parish church, Brecknockshire, on 8 April 1749. &#145;A stranger that intermeddleth not with our joy said &#147;It looked more like a funeral than a wedding&#148;. My brother seemed the happiest person among us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Jackson, 2.56). It was a love-match of rare harmony and achieved a degree of happiness seldom seen in the marriage of a Wesley.<br>
<br>In that same year, 1749, came the confused and painful attempt by John Wesley to marry Grace Murray (who subsequently married the Methodist preacher John Bennet), followed by his disastrous marriage to Mrs Mary Vazeille in 1751. To both Charles Wesley reacted with alarm and high emotion. The rights and wrongs of the Murray affair remain debatable. Charles believed that John Bennet had the prior claim to Grace Murray, that her union with John Wesley would split Methodism, and that she was socially unsuitable. He therefore hustled Bennet and Murray into marriage. The account handed down by Charles's wife, Sarah, to her daughter depicted Grace Murray as at best an unstable woman torn between love for Bennet and a prestigious marriage to her leader, but this probably exonerates the Wesley brothers, and especially Charles, too easily. John's marriage to Mary Vazeille dismayed Charles, and he and his sister-in-law remained mutually distrustful until she left her husband in 1771. It may well be that the strained relationships between the brothers over the Murray affair and John's marriage continued to aggravate disagreements on policy over the next few years.<br>
<br>Certainly these personal disturbances coincided with tensions within Methodism. John Bennet's decision to break away was followed by the charge of sexual misconduct by the preacher James Wheatley which led the brothers to agree that Charles should from now on investigate preachers' characters and abilities. Although Charles reluctantly sanctioned lay preachers he doubted their talents and competence. In response to his criticisms in 1751 John Wesley said they needed all the men they could recruit and that &#145;I prefer grace before gifts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 26.472). Charles wrote on this subject to Selina, countess of Huntingdon, in intemperate terms. The preachers, he insisted, should live by their trades and only occasionally take preaching journeys; in addition new recruits would be thoroughly tested by the Wesleys. In making these comments Charles confided his underlying interest that these measures &#145;will break his [John's] power, their [preachers] not depending on him for bread&#146; and so &#145;reduce his authority within due bounds as well as guard against that rashness and credulity of his which has kept me in continual awe and bondage for many years&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Charles Wesley</span>, 84&#150;5).<br>
<br>Wesley was even more alarmed about preachers' lack of loyalty to the Church of England. In the mid-1750s a crisis erupted which recurred periodically for the next thirty years. Some preachers registered under the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> as a defence against persecution and some pressed for the right to administer sacraments. Both actions appeared to imply separation from the church. In October 1754 a preacher administered communion in London and, according to Charles, John maintained that &#145;&#147;We have in effect ordained already&#148;. He urged me to sign the preachers' certificates: was inclined to lay on hands, and to let the preachers administer&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Charles Wesley</span>, 92). Charles was only partly reassured at the conference of 1755 when John issued a statement concluding that, whether or not separation was &#145;lawful&#146;, it was not &#145;expedient&#146;. Doubting John's resolution, Charles urged his evangelical friends to put pressure on his brother, even sympathizing with suggestions that the lay preachers should become mere assistants to evangelical clergy. John Wesley believed that to curb them in this way risked losing the evangelistic effectiveness of Methodism.<br>
<br>Between September and November 1756 Wesley made his last tour of the midlands and north of England and then ceased to itinerate. Although family responsibilities, recurring ill health, and depression restricted his movements, his daughter Sarah later claimed that his main concern was not to create discord within the Methodist movement. This was a discreet indication that Charles's doubts about the quality of their preachers and fears about separation from the church would lead to conflict with his brother. She may have been correct in this interpretation, for some of the preachers were certainly hostile to him. On the other hand, Charles's retirement from itinerancy did not prevent him from criticizing his brother.<br>
<br>John Wesley deplored his brother's abandonment of itinerancy. In a revealing letter in October 1753 he had already demanded that Charles &#145;either act really in connexion with me: or never pretend to it&#146;. In reality, he complained, &#145;Either you move (quite contrary to me) by those impressions which you account divine or which is worse, <i>pro ratione voluntas</i> [will instead of reason]&#146;. Charles, he said, had not acted in concert with him &#145;for ten years last past and upwards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 26.527&#150;8). Though John's complaints were coloured by his desire to control preachers' movements, it does look as though Charles's focus, particularly after his marriage, was more on problem areas (especially where there was disaffection towards the established church) rather than on a co-ordinated approach with his brother. He never visited Scotland, nor Ireland after 1748, nor Cornwall after 1753. While seemingly free to interfere where his prejudices were threatened, Charles appeared unwilling and unable to accept regular responsibilities of leadership.<h2>
<a name="MinistryinBristolandLondon17561788"></a>Ministry in Bristol and London, 1756&#150;1788</h2>Charles Wesley remained in Bristol until 1771, though he frequently visited London as well as, on occasions, friends and relatives elsewhere in the south. During this period he continued to worry over the issue of preachers and possibility of separation from the Church of England. In February 1760 three preachers in Norwich administered communion, but John Wesley proceeded as planned to Ireland, merely asking Charles to look into the matter. Charles reacted violently, going so far as to tell the veteran preacher John Nelson: &#145;John, I love thee from my heart: yet rather than see thee a dissenting minister, I wish to see thee smiling in thy coffin&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Charles Wesley</span>, 101). While acknowledging that preachers faced uncertain prospects after the Wesleys' deaths, he could only promise (unrealistically) that he would use his &#145;interest&#146; to obtain Anglican orders for them. His priorities contrasted sharply with his brother's: &#145;My chief concern upon earth &hellip; was the prosperity of the Church of England; my next, that of Methodism, my third that of the preachers&#146;. He would in effect give up the preachers for the good of the Methodists and the Methodists for the good of the church  (ibid., 101, 102). During 1760 he was, in addition, at odds with John over the outbreak of claims to Christian perfection and was much distressed by the trial and execution of Lady Huntingdon's homicidal cousin, Lord Ferrers.<br>
<br>Wesley's growing interest in the careers of his precocious musical sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29068/', "Charles Wesley (1757&#150;1834)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29072/', "Samuel Wesley (1766&#150;1837)")</script>, helped to influence his decision to move to the London area in 1771. He was given the remaining lease on a fully furnished house, 1 Chesterfield Street, in Marylebone (including a cellar of wine), by his friend Mrs Gumley, whose sister-in-law was married to the earl of Bath. Despite his misgivings about Methodism, Charles seems to have been content to act as resident minister in Bristol and then in London, and showed no sign of wishing to settle in an Anglican parish despite rumours of offers. He regularly preached and administered communion in church service hours, using the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. A diligent pastor and prison visitor, he also enjoyed social relationships with the upper classes more than his brother, partly to further his sons' careers.<br>
<br>Wesley took little direct part in the Calvinistic controversy of the 1770s, though he did provide support for his friend John Fletcher, the main protagonist against the evangelical Calvinists. In 1771&#150;3 and again in 1786 he attempted a reconciliation with the Moravians, hoping to combat Methodist separatism. In June 1777 he was greatly exercised over the trial and execution of the popular clergyman William Dodd for forgery. Like his brother, he attacked the American revolutionaries and the Wilkite radicals, though in his case in verse rather than prose. In 1780 he witnessed the anti-Roman Catholic Gordon riots, which he vividly described in letters, poems, and hymns. He furthered the careers of his musical sons by concerts in his home to save them from a more worldly environment, though this also brought Methodist disapproval.<br>
<br>Despite his interventions when the interests of the church seemed threatened, Wesley always made it clear that he dreaded taking on full leadership responsibilities himself. The fate of Methodism after John Wesley's death was a recurring problem. Both Wesley brothers had hopes of a clerical successor, John Fletcher of Madeley being the most favoured candidate. However, in 1773 Fletcher not only refused, but even suggested Charles as his brother's successor. In the end John had to turn to the preachers. In 1784 he enrolled a deed of declaration, fixing the composition and powers of the annual Methodist conference as his legal successor. Meanwhile the American War of Independence had temporarily severed ecclesiastical relations with England, and John seized on the opportunity in 1784 to supply the American Methodists with an ordained ministry together with a revised version of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and articles of religion. He ordained two of his preachers, together with his clerical colleague Thomas Coke as a &#145;superintendent&#146;, and Coke was to ordain Francis Asbury as his co-superintendent in America. In the last years of his life John also ordained for Scotland and, finally, three preachers apparently in reserve for England.<br>
<br>Wesley, who had not been consulted, was outraged at what he took to be the final seal on separation, though John denied this. Charles's disgust was expressed partly in letters, partly in verse:<blockquote>
<div>W&#151; himself and friends betrays,<br>
</div>
<div>By his good sense forsook,<br>
</div>
<div>While suddenly his hands he lays<br>
</div>
<div>On the hot head of C&#151;.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Still more insultingly:<blockquote>
<div>A Roman emperor 'tis said<br>
</div>
<div>His favourite horse a consul made<br>
</div>
<div>But Coke brings other things to pass,<br>
</div>
<div>He makes a bishop of an ass.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Representative Verse</span>, 367)</blockquote>It was in this context that Charles wrote his autobiographical letter to Dr Chandler in April 1785 to portray Methodism as a church movement betrayed by his brother. He quoted Lord Mansfield's assertion that ordination meant separation. The brothers had to agree to differ, Charles leaving John to his own devices. Yet despite their differences he continued his London ministry and summed up his feelings by writing: &#145;Thus our partnership here is ended but not our friendship. I have taken him for better for worse till death do us part&#151;or rather re-unite in love inseparable&#146;  (letter to Chandler, 29 April 1785, Methodist church archives, DDWES/1/38).<br>
<br>In 1788 Wesley's health deteriorated, and despite John's characteristic optimism that travel and folk-remedies would revive his brother, Charles died at home, aged eighty, of exhaustion on 29 March 1788. It is symptomatic of the brothers' ecclesiastical differences that John was buried behind his City Road Chapel, denying the notion of consecrated ground. Charles, however, was interred in the graveyard of his parish church, St Mary's, Marylebone, on 5 April, his pall borne by eight clergymen of the Church of England. The claim that, ironically, this churchyard was unconsecrated appears to be an error. Charles's family had so little money at the time of his death that his funeral expenses were defrayed by his friends.<h2>
<a name="Wesleyaschurchmantheologianpreacherandhymnwriter"></a>Wesley as churchman, theologian, preacher, and hymn writer</h2>John Wesley described himself as &#145;an high churchman, bred up from my childhood in the highest notions of passive obedience and non-resistance&#146;. He was also a &#145;tory&#146;, meaning &#145;one that believes God, not the people, to be the origin of all civil power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Telford, 7.305&#150;6, 6.156). So too was Charles Wesley, yet both violated church order. Likewise, Charles shared John's general view of evangelical theology plus a belief in a form of sacrifice and real presence in the Lord's supper, which he expressed with dramatic physicality in his hymns. But Charles thought Christian perfection scarcely attainable before death. John, operating with a restricted view of sin as &#145;a voluntary transgression of a known law which it is in our power to obey&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 25.289, 318), claimed that the gift could be received at any time, by faith. Charles, by contrast, visualized a gradual and incomplete growth in holiness. He also believed that God used suffering as a purifying agent and might discipline individuals by withholding assurance of salvation, a view which John rejected as unscriptural. These divergences clearly reflected their respective temperaments. Elsewhere, John neatly hit off their differences in preaching style thus: &#145;In connexion [reasoned argument] I beat you; but in strong pointed <i>sentences</i> you beat me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Telford, 5.16). Charles was liable to open his <span class="roman">Bible</span> and select a text at random. Even in old age he sometimes recovered his old fire, and once accidentally knocked the <span class="roman">Bible</span> off the pulpit to be fielded by Thomas Coke. Equally, though, he could also fall into long introspective pauses or announce a hymn if he felt faint. Some thought both brothers were liable to offer poor fare in old age, and Charles's monopoly of the City Road pulpit was resented by some lay preachers.<br>
<br>Charles Wesley has long been regarded as the greatest of English hymn writers, yet in range and intention he was really a writer of &#145;sacred poems&#146; as well. Of his 9000 poems, &#145;hymns&#146; (depending on definition) form between one- and two-thirds of the total. It is only fairly recently that he has received recognition as a poet because hymns have commonly been regarded as too limited in content, metre, and purpose to be assessed as poetry. Charles habitually expressed his feelings and beliefs on a wide range of religiously orientated private and public concerns in verse, including charming pieces for his children:<blockquote>
<div>There was by fond mamma supplied<br>
</div>
<div>Six reasons against Sammi's ride. &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Because 'tis wet, because 'tis dry &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Or any other reason why<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and on the family cat:<blockquote>
<div>I sing Grimalkin brave and bold<br>
</div>
<div>Who makes intruders fly &hellip;<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Unpublished Verse</span>, 1.280)</blockquote>Charles's mind was pervasively furnished with material and images from the classics, the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and English poetry, but above all from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. All these materials were adapted to express Christian experience, above all the love of God. The boundary between sacred and secular here was easily crossed&#151;some poems to his future wife were later adapted as hymns. What has been termed his &#145;physicality&#146;, even &#145;carnality&#146;, did undoubtedly cause uneasiness in later minds. However, to early Methodists Wesley showed that body as well as mind and feelings could express religion, a belief which informed some of the dancing metres and rhythms used in his writing. Like Isaac Watts he adapted literary culture to the needs of less educated readers, but with a much more remarkable range of metres and technical poetic skills. Ideas and images were transmuted and compressed into a few compelling words, simplicity being varied with dramatic use of Latinate words to express feelings or theological paradoxes: &#145;indissolubly joined&#146;, &#145;inextinguishable blaze&#146;,<blockquote>
<div>Our God contracted to a span,<br>
</div>
<div>Incomprehensibly made man.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Methodists unaware of Charles's subtle skills nevertheless unconsciously absorbed a measure of theology and culture as well as expressing their faith and feelings.<h2>
<a name="Characterreputationandsignificance"></a>Character, reputation, and significance</h2>Charles Wesley was short but somewhat stouter in face and figure than John. In college days:<blockquote>full of the muse, and being shortsighted, he would sometimes walk right up against his brother's table and, perhaps, overturn it. If the &#145;fine phrensy&#146; was not quite so high, he would discompose the books and papers in the study, ask some question without always waiting for a reply, repeat some poetry that just then struck him, and at length leave his brother to his regularity. (Moore, 2.368)</blockquote>In old age he would compose hymns on horseback in shorthand, and on reaching the City Road house rush in &#145;crying out &#147;Pen and ink! pen and ink!&#148;&#146; and write out the hymn he had composed  (ibid.). His handwriting was neat, he kept accounts meticulously, but his wife had to attend to his clothes. He wore full clerical dress, preached in gown and bands even in the open air, but unlike his brother wore a clerical wig.<br>
<br>Temperamentally Wesley was subject both to extreme exaltation (especially after preaching successfully) and extreme despair, expressing a desire for death with regularity throughout his life. Yet he also showed considerable moral and physical courage when confronting mobs critical of Methodism. Though a warm friend and tender consoler to the grieving, John Wesley claimed that Charles &#145;suspects everybody, and he is continually imposed upon, but I suspect nobody, and I am never imposed upon&#146;  (Tyerman, <span class="italic">Wesley</span>, 3.297). This was an exaggerated response to Charles's claim that John was too trusting. Charles could be suspicious of those suspected of hostility to the church, and John thought he was liable to be influenced by the person to whom he had last spoken. His sense of public duty conflicted with his modesty and desire for retirement. An affectionate husband and father, he was anxious to imbue his children with the strength of his own evangelical beliefs.<br>
<br>Except as a hymn writer Charles Wesley's reputation has been overshadowed by that of his brother and has been clouded by their disagreements on policy. Unfortunately his journal survives only from 1736 to 1756, with gaps, and the complete text has never been published, though a modern edition is now in preparation. There is no complete or modern edition of his letters or even of his poetry. The fullest biography by Thomas Jackson (1841) is uncritical and, with the exception of Frank Baker (1948) and J. R. Tyson's <span class="italic">Reader</span> (1989), later biographers have largely tended to recycle published material.<br>
<br>Charles Wesley's overall significance for Methodism and the eighteenth century revival remains difficult to estimate, but he was clearly more than a hymn writer, however distinguished he proved in this field. Liable to be seen as a well-intentioned but misguided drag on his brother's mission, he deserves to be judged as an independent personality and in terms of his own vision of Methodism. His early journeys for evangelism and oversight significantly aided Methodism's take-off, while his role as pastor stabilized the important Bristol and London societies. John Wesley's pragmatic attitude to irregularities was probably necessary for Methodism's dynamism, yet it is arguable that Charles's restraints on his brother's &#145;rashness&#146; helped to raise preachers' standards and warded off the risk of a premature break with the church in the 1750s which would have narrowed the appeal of the movement at a critical stage. Recent research suggests that his opposition to his brother's ministries was supported by a significant body of leading laymen especially in London.<br>
<br>Charles's wife, <a name="cosubject_63663"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Wesley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gwynne]</span></span>  (1726&#150;1822), <span class="occ">Methodist sympathizer</span>, was born on 12 October 1726 at Garth, Brecknockshire, the fifth of the nine children of Marmaduke Gwynne (1691&#150;1769), gentleman, and his wife, Sarah (1695&#150;1769/70), daughter of Daniel Evans and his wife, Mary. She was educated by private masters, and by the age of ten was proficient in music and singing. Her father was a firm Anglican and magistrate, but his conversion by Howell Harris, the Welsh evangelical, led him to support the Methodists. Her mother was one of six heiresses, each reputedly with a portion of &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>Sarah was devout from an early age, receiving communion at fourteen and accompanying her father to hear Harris. She first met Charles Wesley on 28 August 1747 and it appears to have been a case of love at first sight. They were married at Llanllywenfel on 8 April 1749. Sarah had agreed to allow Charles to maintain his vegetarian diet and travels, even to Ireland, against her mother's protests. The journeys recommenced almost at once, though they took a house in Bristol in September 1749. Sarah became a willing hostess to visiting preachers, saying that these plain men &#145;were proofs that grace supplied all the felicitous aid of education and good breeding&#146;  (Methodist church archives, DDWES 1/59). Her sweet singing sometimes surprised and delighted visitors and Methodist meetings.<br>
<br>At first Sarah Wesley patiently endured the privations of travelling with Charles, including mob violence. Late in 1753 she was struck down with smallpox, having refused vaccination apparently through religious scruples, and was left so disfigured as to be almost unrecognizable. She ironically commented that this &#145;afforded great satisfaction to her dear husband who was glad to see her look so much older and better suited to be his wife&#146;  (S. Wesley, &#145;Memoir of Mrs Sarah Wesley&#146;, 509). Their first child also died of smallpox on 7 January 1754. They had eight children but only three survived to maturity: a daughter, Sarah, and the precocious musicians Charles and Samuel.<br>
<br>Sarah Wesley enjoyed friendship and correspondence with socially prominent people, especially evangelical peeresses. Her circle widened further with the family's move to Marylebone in 1771. Following her husband's death in March 1788, she was left with recurring financial problems. Accounts of the reasons for this vary. It appears that capital equivalent to her husband's &pound;100 p.a. from Methodism was invested for her, but other money was realized and spent, and she received an annuity from William Wilberforce and occasional income from legacies and the Methodists. Her son Samuel's debts also drained her resources.<br>
<br>Despite her own difficulties, Sarah was conspicuous for her care of the poor and pity for evil-doers, since she thought anyone might fall but for divine grace. She had a strong sense of her sins and a recurring fear of death except in her last illness. Sarah's reading was confined to religious books, for she did not relish any others. Her daughter thought her chief faults were excessive hospitality and indulgence of her children. In fact Sarah's life was principally devoted to her husband's welfare and her care probably prolonged his life. She provided a much needed balance to his fluctuating temperament and his brother's demands, while her social contacts aided her sons' careers. Her quiet personality masked a strength of will expressed in her marriage despite family doubts. She insisted that she be allowed to attend George Whitefield and other &#145;gospel ministers&#146; despite the Wesleys' opposition to their Calvinism. Solicitous of the brothers' reputation she passed on family traditions favourable to them to her daughter and so to later biographers, and her short memoir of Charles prefaced a volume of his sermons (1816). She died on 28 December 1822, weakened by a cold and old age, and was buried with her husband in the churchyard of St Mary's, Marylebone.<br>
