<span class="headword">Lucas,  Samuel</span>  (1805&#150;1870), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire, the son of William Lucas, a brewer. He was educated at Hitchin and at a Quaker school in Bristol, and wanted to be an artist, but his Quaker religion at that time forbade an artistic education. He was apprenticed to a shipowner at Shoreham in Sussex, but managed to practise painting as an amateur. After his marriage in Norfolk to Matilda, daughter of John Holmes, a farmer, on 7 September 1837 he settled at Hitchin, where he resided for the remainder of his life. Though he carried on his father's business, Lucas continued to devote himself to his favourite art; his wife, son, daughters, and granddaughters also painted.<br>
<br>In 1830 Lucas sent to the Royal Academy <span class="italic">The Ship &#145;Broxbournbury&#146; off the Islands of Amsterdam</span>. He also exhibited at the British Institution and Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street, but such public displays were rare. His subjects were mainly landscapes, carefully studied from nature, and he painted both in oil and in watercolours. He was an excellent ornithologist, and also painted birds, animals, and flowers. Some of his drawings of flowers were engraved in <span class="italic">The Florist</span>. His pictures were much admired, and he enjoyed the friendship of many leading artists. Good examples of his drawings are in the British Museum, and there is a picture by him, <span class="italic">The Old Hitchin Market</span>, in the Corn Exchange at Hitchin. Lucas was struck with paralysis in 1865 and died in Tilehouse Street, Hitchin, on 29 March 1870. His wife survived him.<br>
