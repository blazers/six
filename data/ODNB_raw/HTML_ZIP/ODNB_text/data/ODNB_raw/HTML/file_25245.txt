<span class="headword">Shaw, Sir  Charles</span>  (1795&#150;1871), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of Charles Shaw, clerk of the county of Ayr, and his wife, Barbara Wright, daughter of a customs official at Greenock, was born at Ayr. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25244/', "Alexander Shaw (1804&#150;1890)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25257/', "John Shaw (1792&#150;1827)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25263/', "Patrick Shaw (1796&#150;1872)")</script> were his brothers. He was educated in Ayr, and at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh. He entered the army by purchase as ensign in the 52nd light infantry on 23 January 1813, and joined the 2nd battalion at Shorncliffe in March. From Shorncliffe, Shaw went to Hythe, and at the end of November he accompanied his regiment to Ramsgate, where they embarked for the Netherlands, landing at Tholen on 19 December. He was engaged in the capture of the village of Merxem, near Antwerp, on 31 January 1814, and, after serving through the campaign, was employed with his regiment in garrison duty at Antwerp. On the escape of Napoleon from Elba, Shaw was sent to Courtrai towards the end of March and to Ath in April, in the middle of which month he was drafted into the 1st battalion, commanded by Sir John Colborne. During the battle of Waterloo Shaw was on baggage-guard duty at Brussels. He took part in the subsequent march to and occupation of Paris.<br>
<br>In March 1816 Shaw joined the 2nd battalion at Canterbury, and on its disbandment in July was placed on half pay. After six months in Scotland, he travelled in the Netherlands in 1817. In July he was brought back to full pay in the 90th light infantry. On obtaining leave of absence, he made a tour in the Hartz Mountains, and in September entered as a student in the military department of the Carolinum College at Brunswick to improve his qualifications for a military career. He left Brunswick in January 1818 for Berlin to see something of the Prussian army, and, after a tour in Prussia, joined the 90th at Plymouth on 10 March 1818. From Plymouth the regiment went to Chatham, and, on a reduction of the army taking place shortly after, Shaw was again placed on half pay.<br>
<br>After attending a course of lectures at Edinburgh University, Shaw accepted an offer of partnership in an old-established wine business in Leith. He became captain and commander of the volunteer corps of Leith sharpshooters, and brought them to a high state of efficiency. On the disbandment of this corps Shaw was presented by its members, on 19 July 1822, with a handsome piece of plate. He established the first military club in Edinburgh, called the Caledonian United Service Club, for which he acted as honorary secretary until 1830. In that year, disliking commerce, he sold his business and travelled on the continent, returning to England in September 1831.<br>
<br>In November 1831 Shaw was appointed captain of a light company of marines in the liberating army of Portugal against Dom Miguel, the heir to the throne. He embarked with recruits on 15 December, joined the fleet of Admiral George Sartorius at Belle &Icirc;le, arrived at the rendezvous at Terceira in the Azores towards the end of February 1832, and in May proceeded to Fayal and St Michael's. In June the expedition left the Azores for Portugal, and disembarked on the morning of 5 July at Mindella, about 10 miles from Porto, which city was entered the same afternoon, the Miguelites having evacuated it.<br>
<br>Shaw, who in August 1832 was made a major of one of the battalions of British volunteers, saw much fighting around Porto, and was in every action and sortie during the siege of the city by Dom Miguel. He was twice wounded in the attack on his position on 29 September, when after a severe fight the Miguelites were repulsed. He was also severely wounded in the sortie of 17 November, and was subsequently made a knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal.<br>
<br>In 1833 Shaw commanded the Scottish contingent at Lordello, an outpost of the defences of Porto. In July 1833 he was appointed colonel and given the command of an English battalion, which he led in the repulse of Bourmont's attack on 25 July. At the end of September he embarked with his battalion for Lisbon, landing at S&atilde;o Martinho and marching from there to Torres Vedras to operate on the rear of the Miguelite army on its withdrawal from the attack on Lisbon. He and his battalion did much marching during the next eight months, but not much fighting. On 26 May 1834, two days after Shaw entered Estremez, the war ended.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1834 Shaw marched to Lisbon in command of a brigade of 2500 men, which he there handed over to a Portuguese officer. From this time until February 1835 Shaw's time was mainly occupied in attempts to effect a financial settlement between the officers and men of the British contingent under his command and the Portuguese government in accordance with the terms of engagement, but he was only partially successful. He left Portugal in June 1835 and arrived at Falmouth on 12 July.<br>
<br>On 17 July Shaw was gazetted a brigadier-general to command a Scottish brigade of the auxiliary legion then being raised in England by Sir George de Lacy Evans for service in Spain against the Carlists, and at once went to Glasgow to assist in raising recruits. He went to Spain in September 1835, landing on the 10th at Santander and marching with some 1600 men, whom he brought out with him, to Portugalete. Here he found that his rank would be only that of colonel in command of a small brigade of two regiments. In February 1836 he was given command of a brigade of three fine Irish regiments, but not the rank of brigadier-general. Until April 1836 he was quartered principally in Vitoria and the surrounding area. On 13 April his brigade embarked at Santander and arrived on the 24th at San Sebastian, which was besieged by Don Carlos. On 5 May an attack was made on the Carlist position on the heights above San Sebastian, and after a protracted fight the day was won. Shaw was struck by a spent ball, and another struck his watch. He was made a brigadier-general and decorated with the third class of the order of San Fernando. On 31 May Shaw skilfully repulsed an attack on his lines; at the end of August, owing to an unfortunate and avoidable quarrel with Evans, Shaw sent in his resignation, which Evans accepted with great regret at the loss of so gallant an officer.<br>
<br>Shaw arrived in England at the end of September 1836, and for a time resided at Richmond, Surrey. In 1837 he published his rambling and egotistical <span class="italic">Personal memoirs and correspondence &hellip; Comprising a narrative of the war for constitutional liberty in Portugal and in Spain from its commencement in 1831 to the dissolution of the British legion in 1837</span>. He was appointed in September 1839 chief commissioner of police at Manchester, a post that he held until September 1842.<br>
<br>Shaw married, in 1841, Louisa Hannah, only daughter of Major Martin Curry of the 67th regiment; they had a son, Charles Martin, who, with his mother, survived Shaw. During the latter part of his life Shaw lived at Homburg-von-der-Hohe, where he died in February 1871 and was buried with military honours.<br>
