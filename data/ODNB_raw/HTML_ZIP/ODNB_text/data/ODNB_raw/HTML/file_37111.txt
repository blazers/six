<span class="headword">Alured,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607, <em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">army officer and regicide</span>, was baptized in the parish of All Saints, Sculcoates, Hull, Yorkshire, on 4 April 1607, the eldest son of Henry Alured (<i>c</i>.1581&#150;1628), gentleman landowner, and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1626), daughter of Francis Vaughan of Sutton upon Derwent, Yorkshire. The Alureds moved to Yorkshire from East Anglia during Henry VIII's reign, establishing their seat at the Hull Charterhouse, just north of the town. Alured belonged to the fourth, and last, generation of the family to sit in parliament; his great-grandfather and grandfather represented Hull in three of the Elizabethan parliaments, and his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70628/', "Thomas Alured")</script>, sat for the nearby borough of Hedon in 1628&#150;9. (Alured's father never served as an MP, as some authorities have claimed.) Alured's pedigree as a parliament-man was matched by his godly ancestry. The Alureds had supported further reformation in religion since the 1580s, and John's uncle, Thomas, was part of a high-powered puritan clique that opposed the crown over the Spanish match.<br>
<br>On 11 August 1628, a few months after inheriting the family estate (worth &pound;400&#150;&pound;500 a year), Alured was admitted to Gray's Inn. Despite his godly background, he was described about 1630 as &#145;a most profane young gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">God's Plot</span>, 53). It was his marriage on 17 November 1631 to his second cousin Mary, daughter of the godly North Riding knight Sir Richard Darley of Buttercrambe (father of the future parliamentarians Henry and Richard Darley), and the influence of the Darleys' chaplain&#151;the puritan divine, Thomas Shepard&#151;that worked a &#145;great reformation&#146;  (ibid.) in his conduct. The marriage also had material benefits&#151;Sir Richard settled a &#145;considerable sum[m]e of money&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C10/14/3) on his daughter as her marriage portion. The union produced two sons before Mary's death some time in or before 1635. Alured married again about June that year; his second wife was Mary, daughter of John Arnold, a London feltmaker, whom he later deserted along with their son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Alured consolidated his family's puritan connections, becoming an investor in the Providence Island Company, of which Viscount Saye and Sele and Henry Darley were leading members. In July 1638, as the kingdom began to mobilize for war against the Scottish covenanters, he was reported to the privy council for having declared that the Scots were &#145;brave boyes&#146; and would &#145;reforme this land by a parlim[en]t &hellip; for the kinge would be forsed to lay downe his taxes by theire comminge in to England&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/395/29, fol. 56). In the elections to the Short Parliament in 1640, he was returned for Hedon&#151;probably on the interest of his kinsman Henry, first Viscount Dunbar, from whom the Alureds leased the manor of Burstwick, near Hedon. Alured signed at least two of the three Yorkshire petitions of July, August, and September 1640, complaining about illegal billeting and requesting that the king summon parliament. Re-elected for Hedon in the autumn, he was a member of the committee that the Long Parliament sent to Hull in May 1642 to assist Sir John Hotham&#151;who would later accuse Alured of plotting his downfall.<br>
<br>Alured and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66498/', "Matthew Alured (bap. 1615, d. 1694)")</script> were commissioned as captain and lieutenant of horse respectively under the earl of Essex in July 1642, but John spent most of the war as a colonel in Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax's northern parliamentarian army. He fought at several engagements, including Adwalton Moor (and probably Marston Moor), and was part of the entourage that Sir Thomas Fairfax took to London in February 1645 to take up his command of the New Model Army. Alured may well have been a patron of Philip Nye's Independent congregation at Hull&#151;of which his own parish minister, Robert Luddington, was a member&#151;and had certainly fallen out of sympathy with the Scots by 1645, signing numerous letters to parliament from the Yorkshire parliamentary committees in the summer and autumn of that year complaining about the &#145;oppressions&#146; of the Scottish army in the north.<br>
<br>Never very active at Westminster, Alured virtually abandoned his seat altogether after May 1645. Despite his political inactivity, he was evidently thought well-affected by the army and its allies, for on 6 January 1649 he was appointed one of the commissioners for the king's trial. He attended numerous meetings of the trial commission, was present on 27 January when sentence was pronounced, and signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. According to a Restoration pamphleteer, Alured was a man of &#145;turbulent spirit, and apt to take fire like gunpowder&#146;, although he could also be &#145;a cruel and close pursuer of whatsoever he intended to put in execution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cromwell the Late Great Tirant</span>, 1660, 5). It was perhaps this last trait that steeled him for regicide. In the summer of 1649 he petitioned parliament for compensation for his losses&#151;which he put at &pound;5275&#151;and arrears of pay amounting to &pound;5494. In August 1649 the house ordered that he be paid &pound;2000, but he probably saw none of this sum before his death in the autumn of 1651. His place of burial is not known. According to his widow, he died in possession of an estate of &#145;great yearly &hellip; value&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C10/465/3).<br>
