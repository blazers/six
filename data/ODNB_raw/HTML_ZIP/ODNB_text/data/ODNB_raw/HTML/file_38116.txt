<span class="headword">Welch,  (Maurice) Denton</span>  (1915&#150;1948), <span class="occ">writer and painter</span>, was born in Shanghai on 29 March 1915, the youngest of the four sons (there were no daughters) of Arthur Joseph Welch, a wealthy English rubber merchant, and his American wife, Rosalind Bassett. After spending an itinerant early childhood he was educated first at an eccentric preparatory school intended for the sons of Christian Scientists, St Michael's in Uckfield, Sussex, and later at Repton School, from where, at the age of sixteen, he ran away. When he was seventeen he returned to China for several months.<br>
<br>Welch's original ambition was to be a painter, and in 1933 he enrolled at Goldsmiths' College School of Art. Welch's spell as an art student came to an abrupt end, however, in 1935, at the age of twenty, when he was knocked off his bicycle by a motorist. He sustained appalling injuries, including a fracture of the spine. Long periods of enforced solitude as a semi-invalid threw him back on the resources of his own imagination, and after reading <span class="italic">Hindoo Holiday</span> by J. R. Ackerley, he resolved to write a semi-autobiographical novel, based on Repton and China. The result, <span class="italic">Maiden Voyage</span> (1943), was acclaimed by Edith Sitwell, who contributed a foreword in which she wrote: &#145;This is a very moving and remarkable first book and the author appears to be that rare being, a born writer.&#146; Welch's second novel, <span class="italic">In Youth is Pleasure</span>, recalling a summer holiday at the age of fifteen, was published two years later, and was dedicated to the memory of his mother, who had died when he was eleven. A number of Welch's short stories, all in effect autobiographical, were published during his lifetime, by Cyril Connolly in <span class="italic">Horizon</span>, John Lehmann in Penguin <span class="italic">New Writing</span>, and Peter Quennell in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>. Within the space of only eight years, although desperately ill, and while painting and illustrating as well, he completed some sixty short stories, all published posthumously, three novels, and a quarter of a million words of journals.<br>
<br>Because Welch was so isolated physically, and knew only a handful of fellow artists&#151;his friends did include John Minton, with whom he collaborated over the line drawings for <span class="italic">Vogue's Contemporary Cooking</span>, by Doris Lytton Toye, Keith Vaughan, and Graham Sutherland, a near neighbour in Kent&#151;Welch never attached himself formally to any school of painting, yet he became an almost unconscious and very prolific exponent of the neo-Romantic movement. He provided quixotic endpapers for his own first editions, which later became collectors' items, and his paintings, in oils, watercolours, and pencil, crayon, and gouache, were exhibited in the 1940s at the Leicester Galleries. After his death many were given away or sold for a few pounds, and he was largely ignored as a painter until in 1987 six examples of his work were loaned to an exhibition entitled &#145;A paradise lost&#146; at the Barbican Art Gallery, devoted to the neo-Romantic movement. There are self-portraits in the National Portrait Gallery in London and at the University of Texas in Austin.<br>
<br>The quality, quantity, and character of Welch's output as a writer were inevitably circumscribed by his relative immobility, and the restrictions this placed on the acquisition of new material and experience. But he was in any event fascinated by his childhood and adolescence, and by the time he died this juvenile field had been fruitfully tilled and probably exhausted. It is his interest in the minutiae of life and his shrewd and perceptive descriptions of people, places, and events that have left the most indelible impression on his admirers. His journals in particular constitute a moving memorial to a young man of integrity and moral courage, whose determination not to succumb to pain and humiliation was at times heroic. It took him four years to write his third, and posthumously published, novel, <span class="italic">A Voice through a Cloud</span> (1950), an account of the accident itself and his struggle to convalesce. The manuscript was found beside his bed, complete except for about half a dozen pages, when he died, on 30 December 1948, at his home, Middle Orchard, Crouch, near Sevenoaks, Kent. During the last four years of his life he had been nursed by Eric Oliver, his partner for those years.<br>
