<span class="headword">Mandeville,  William  de</span>, third earl of Essex  (<em>d.</em> 1189), <span class="occ">magnate and courtier</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17927/', "Geoffrey de Mandeville, first earl of Essex (d. 1144)")</script>, and Rohese de Vere. William inherited the earldom of Essex in 1166, after the death of his brother Geoffrey. Little is known of Mandeville's early years and training, but the Walden chronicler relates that he spent most of his youth at the court of the counts of Flanders, and received the belt of knighthood from the hands of Count Philip, Henry II's first cousin. Philip's warm recommendation of Mandeville was partly responsible for Henry's speedy transfer of the earldom to him. The Mandeville lands, from which the earldom had been created in 1141, formed one of the wealthiest honours in England (&pound;740) at the time of <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, and by 1166 contained 110 knights' fees. The family's hereditary custodianship of the Tower of London and two valuable manors, however, were withheld from Mandeville. If he harboured any grievances over this reduction of his inheritance, they never came to the surface; and he was more than compensated for their loss by his friendship with the king.<br>
<br>Earl William became a regular member of Henry II's entourage shortly after his investiture. His rise at court was due as much to his own considerable military and diplomatic skills as to the deaths of the king's earlier baronial advisers. And the bond of friendship that existed between the earl and king from the first never diminished. Throughout the 1170s and 1180s the earl was either at Henry's side, or engaged in royal business elsewhere. It is possible to trace his movements back and forth from England and the continent in the pipe rolls. Between 1173 and 1187 no fewer than nineteen channel crossings are recorded, some of them relating to embassies led by Mandeville to the courts of Flanders, France, and Germany. The high respect with which Mandeville was regarded by the Angevin court is illustrated by a passage from the <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span>  (1.271&#150;5). When in 1188 Philip Augustus of France suggested that he and Henry II should settle their differences through a trial by combat, William Marshal volunteered that the English champions should be himself and William de Mandeville.<br>
<br>There were many rewards for royal service. Over a twenty-two-year period, the minuscule sum of &pound;174 was levied by the English exchequer against Mandeville in the form of scutages, aids, forest pleas, murder fines, and communal taxes. Of this amount, the sum of &pound;3 was all that was ever paid into the exchequer, the remainder being pardoned. In contrast, Mandeville took more than &pound;1600 from the exchequer in <i>terrae datae</i>, outright gifts, and the third penny of Essex. An even more valuable reward came to him through his marriage in 1180, arranged by Henry II, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59591/', "Hawisa (d. 1213/14)")</script>, heir to the Anglo-Norman lands and fees of the counts of Aumale. Richard of Devizes characterizes the countess of Aumale as &#145;a woman who was almost a man, lacking nothing virile except virile organs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Richardi Divisensis</span>, 10). Whatever the facts of the matter, the countess was a rich prize, bringing Mandeville the baronies of Holderness and Skipton in England and the county and castle of Aumale in Normandy.<br>
<br>Mandeville's possession of the county of Aumale established him as one of the great border barons along the sensitive eastern Norman frontier, and Henry meant to rely on the earl as the defender of that frontier. This design is revealed in two contemporary sources. The Walden chronicler, after discussing the earl's marriage, goes on to say that he &#145;was a brave man, mighty in arms and held in esteem by all; and therefore he abode little in England among his own people, but guarded the castles and fortifications in Normandy handed over to him by King Henry, which were stronger than the rest and situated along the frontier&#146;  (Dugdale, <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>, 4.144). A fragment from the Norman pipe roll of 1184 discloses that the castles in question were Gisors, Neaufle, Dangu, Neufch&acirc;teau, and Vaudreuil in the region of the Vexin and the Seine River above Rouen. Henry II's trust was never betrayed and Earl William proved a valued ally in the ageing king's confrontations with his troublesome cousin Philip, count of Flanders.<br>
<br>From 1180 until his death in 1189 Henry II was involved in the tasks of maintaining the integrity of his vast dominions, finding a workable solution to the succession problem brought about by the unfortunate deaths of his elder sons, and preventing a dispute between Philip of Flanders and Philip of France from erupting into a large-scale war which might have upset the tenuous balance of power in western France. In this last endeavour he sought to utilize Earl William's long-standing friendship with the count to help manage the Franco-Flemish conflict. As late as 1177&#150;8 the two boyhood companions had spent a full year in one another's company on crusade in the Holy Land. Indeed, the seals of Earl William and Count Philip from this period exhibit so many similarities that it is likely that the earl's was a close copy of the count's, perhaps even a gift. This friendship, without doubt, is why Henry chose the city of Aumale on at least two occasions for the site of peace talks he arranged between the warring parties, and it also explains why Mandeville was named receiver for Philip's English landed revenues while the count was in disfavour.<br>
<br>Earl William's final meeting with the king he had served so faithfully came a month before Henry's death in July 1189. At this meeting the earl was made to swear with William Fitzralph that if ill befell Henry, they would hand over the castles in their charge to no one except Prince John. John's lack of loyalty to his father in these final weeks released the earl from his oath. As it happened, Richard inherited the Angevin dominion intact, and like his father sought to use the earl's talents in their governance and defence. Mandeville carried the crown at Richard I's coronation on 3 September 1189, and a few days later, at the Council of Pipewell, Northamptonshire, the king named him chief justiciar jointly with Bishop Hugh of Durham. In November 1189 Richard I sent Mandeville on an embassy to the court of Philip of France. The earl never returned to England. Departing from Paris, he fell ill at Gisors and died shortly afterwards at Vaudreuil, five months after the passing of his benefactor and friend, Henry II. Although the earl had once expressed a wish to be buried in the Mandeville family priory of Walden, his men deemed a winter crossing of the channel too dangerous and he was laid to rest at the Cistercian abbey of Mortemer near Aumale&#151;a fitting burial place for one so closely connected with the Angevin royal house, since the abbey had been richly endowed by the Empress Matilda and Henry II, who were responsible for many of its buildings.<br>
<br>William was the last of the Mandevilles. The Countess Hawisa married in succession William de Forz (<i>d</i>. 1195) and Baldwin de B&eacute;thune (<i>d</i>. 1212), taking with her on each occasion the Aumale ancestral lands. The descent of the Mandeville honour and Essex earldom was much more complicated. William de Mandeville's aunt, Beatrice de Say, sister of Earl Geoffrey, stood to inherit. But by 1189 Beatrice was too old&#151;almost eighty&#151;to administer the earldom effectively. Her heirs were the daughters of her eldest son, William, who had died in 1177, and her youngest son, Geoffrey de Say. William clearly intended his cousin Geoffrey de Say to succeed him in the event of his dying, as happened, without children. However, the legality of the representative heir inheriting before the younger cadet, a dilemma similar to that faced by the Angevin house itself in the 1190s, eventually prevailed when Beatrice's son-in-law, the practised courtier Geoffrey fitz Peter, manipulated his way into possession of the earldom. Geoffrey, who later became justiciar of England, completed the takeover by having his children adopt the Mandeville surname, thus keeping alive, if only in name, the family's illustrious history of service to the Norman and Angevin rulers.<br>
