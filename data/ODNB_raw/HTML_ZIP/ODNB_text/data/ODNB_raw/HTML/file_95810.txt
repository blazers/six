<span class="headword">Hall,  Keith Graham  Clifford</span>  (1910&#150;1964), <span class="occ">optometrist</span>, was born on 28 March 1910 at the Red House, Chesterton Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, the son of the Revd Albert Clifford Hall (1876&#150;1963), Congregational minister and general secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association, and his wife, Bessie Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watt (1875&#150;1973). He was brought up first in Cambridge, the family later moving to Purley, where he attended Caterham School, Surrey. After a year with a City shipping firm he became an apprentice optician, qualifying by evening courses at Northampton Polytechnic. With his father officiating he married Winifred May (Susan or Maisie) Gibbard (1904&#150;1987) at Purley Congregational Church on 10 May 1934. They had three children, Timothy, later a Royal Navy dental surgeon, Christopher, who died in infancy, and an adopted daughter, Alison.<br>
<br>Clifford Hall founded his first practice in Worcester Park in May 1932, starting contact lens fitting in 1934. He added practices in Banstead and North Cheam before founding in 1945 the first British optometric practice specializing in contact lenses at 139 Park Lane, later moving to the sixth floor of 140 Park Lane. He saw three new patients per day, each taking over three hours. As people travelled long distances he tried to get everything done in one visit. He fitted members of at least two royal families, and Esmond Knight, the actor blinded in 1941 while serving in the navy. In 1945, of the five clinics fitting contact lenses in London, his was the only one run by an optometrist, the others being run by dispensing opticians under the supervision of ophthalmologists. In 1946&#150;7 the waiting list for a new contact lens appointment with Clifford Hall was over a year.<br>
<br>On his first visit to the United States in 1939 to visit the contact lens pioneer Theo Obrig, Clifford Hall met Frank Dickinson aboard the <i>Queen Mary</i> and they became firm friends. After the war he visited the USA twice more, visiting major contact lens practitioners and learning the American methods of contact lens fitting. He visited Belgium and Germany in 1946 and soon after went to Rio de Janeiro and the Russian sector of Berlin. In 1959 he visited Soviet Russia to see the first contact lens department in Moscow. A planned visit to meet Otto Wichterle (inventor of soft lenses) in Prague in 1964 was forestalled by illness. Clifford Hall's interest in soft lenses started in 1948 when he predicted that the future would lie in a disposable soft lens with the consistency of a &#145;well sucked fruit gum&#146;  (private information, Timothy Hall). By invitation of Norwegian ophthalmologists, he built an extensive practice in Norway, specializing in fitting lenses for keratoconus in Oslo, Trondheim, and Bergen on a regular basis. He also worked in Denmark for some years.<br>
<br>With Dickinson, Clifford Hall wrote <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Prescribing and Fitting of Contact Lenses</span> (1946), the first technical British book on contact lens fitting. He published extensively on keratoconus. He was a fellow of the American Association of Optometry and president and treasurer of its British chapter, and senior examiner for the British Optical Association from 1948. His enthusiasm and high standards contributed much to the development of contact lenses and he published widely. Constantly willing to share his experience of contact lens fitting, he was a lecturer and examiner noted for his sincerity, integrity, and sense of humour. The International Society of Contact Lens Specialists awarded him the Herschel gold medal in 1958, and he was twice president of the Contact Lens Society. He died of a coronary thrombosis on 16 November 1964 in Bergen, Norway, and was cremated at Worth crematorium, Surrey. Frank Dickinson wrote that &#145;Keith's devotion to his work was a source of inspiration to us all&#151;his death has removed one of the most highly regarded figures in the world of optometry &hellip; from the outset he set a high standard which was never compromised&#146;  (<span class="italic">Optometry Today</span>, 12 December 1997). The Keith Clifford Hall Book Collection, part of the British College of Optometrists Library, was founded in 1971 at Dickinson's suggestion. A Westminster city council plaque was unveiled outside Clifford Hall's former practice in Park Lane in 1997.<br>
