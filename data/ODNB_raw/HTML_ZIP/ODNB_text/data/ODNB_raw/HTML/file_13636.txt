<span class="headword">Home,  Alexander</span>, fifth Lord Home  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1575), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13641/', "George Hume or Home, fourth Lord Hume (d. 1549)")</script>, and his wife, Dame Mariota Haliburton. He was probably sixteen when his curators were chosen, about 1541. He had acquired his father's titles and estates by March 1550, though these were not ratified by retour until 16 April 1551. There was a rumour that he would be offered the earldom of March in June 1565, but this never materialized. About 1558 he married Margaret Ker of Cessford, who died on 24 June 1565, leaving a daughter Margaret who married George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal, about 1581. Home's second wife, whom he married in October 1565, was Agnes Gray (<i>d</i>. 1583&times;6), daughter of Patrick, Lord Gray, and widow of Robert Logan of Restalrig. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13637/', "Alexander Home, sixth Lord Home and later first earl of Home")</script>, and two daughters including Isobel, who later married Sir James Home of Eccles. Agnes later married Sir Thomas Lyon of Baldukie, after Lord Home's death. Home also had a bastard son, John, provost of Dunglass, who was legitimized by the privy council in 1565.<br>
<br>Alexander Home is first noticed as the fourth lord's son and heir in a land grant of June 1535. Eager to placate James V at the time of the latter's general revocation of all land grants in 1538, his father granted Alexander's marriage agreement to the king. Alexander was to &#145;contract marriage with ane dochtir naturale of his hienes&#146; and could not marry elsewhere without the king's consent  (Hannay, 468&#150;9). The king had in mind a daughter of his liaison with Elizabeth Beaton, but this wedding never happened. The rights to Alexander's marriage were then passed successively to James Douglas, third earl of Morton, in October 1541, and to Margaret Stewart, sister of the earl of Lennox, in 1542. There were rumours that he would marry a daughter of George, Lord Seton, in 1543, as Seton had acquired the rights from Margaret Stewart. It was not until 1550 that Alexander had his choice of bride given to him by Mary of Guise in return for good service on the borders. He thereafter chose to marry the daughter of a border laird instead of a fellow nobleman's daughter.<br>
<br>In the 1540s, as master of Home, Alexander served bravely alongside his father in the wars against England. The English falsely claimed that &#145;Master Howme&#146; had assured to their allegiance in October 1543. Lord Home and his son would never betray the Scots throughout the troubled 1540s, though a few of their kinsmen did capitulate. Henry VIII demanded Alexander as a hostage in July 1544 to stop Scottish retribution for the earl of Hertford's raid on Scotland that May. Home defied him by evading capture on several occasions, and he and his kin signed an assurance to defend the Merse and Teviotdale from English attack at the parliament of October 1545. Alexander's luck had run out by May 1546, however, when he was listed as an English prisoner, though there was some discussion of exchanging him for the earl of Cumberland's brother, Thomas Clifford. The master was probably released later in 1546, as he attended parliament that year with his father, but he was recaptured after the Scottish defeat at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547. By November 1547 Lady Home was begging Protector Somerset (formerly Hertford) to let her son come home while she was secretly negotiating the surrender of Hume Castle. The master of Home and his mother were now seen to be important in their own right as the fourth Lord Home had been badly injured at Pinkie. After a licensed return to Scotland on 6 December 1548 Alexander probably assisted with the recapture of Hume Castle from the English on 16 December. He went on to help recapture the occupied town of Kelso as well. By July 1549 he and his father were receiving pensions for themselves and regular salaries for the Hume garrison. By October 1559 these salaries amounted to &pound;75 Scots per month.<br>
<br>Alexander Home was acting as his father's executor by March 1550, and it was as Lord Home that he accompanied Mary of Guise on her voyage to France in the summer of 1550. Once in France he was amply rewarded for his family's service to both Scotland and France during the 1540s. His French pensions were paid regularly throughout the 1550s, but dried up after Mary's death in 1560. After he returned from France, Home took a leading role in the administration of the Anglo-Scottish borders throughout the 1550s and 1560s. He was warden and justiciar of the Scottish east march during 1550&#150;58 and 1559&#150;70 and was temporarily joint warden of the east and middle marches in 1557&#150;8. He was additionally a border commissioner in 1550 and 1559 and a guardian of Liddesdale in 1562. During 1554, when he was &#145;trublit with infirmitie&#146;, he asked his brother Andrew, commendator of Jedburgh, to deputize  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, <i>addenda</i>, 122). Home also held local offices as bailie and chamberlain of the crown lands in the Merse, steward and receiver of the earldom of March, bailie of Coldingham, Eccles, and Dryburgh, heritable bailie of Coldstream Priory (from 1566), and sheriff of Berwickshire and bailie of Lauderdale after the downfall of the fourth earl of Bothwell in 1567. The latter appointment gave Home particular pleasure as he had viewed Bothwell as a territorial rival, even though the Home kindred was firmly entrenched in Berwickshire by the mid-sixteenth century.<br>
<br>At a national level Home attended parliaments in 1546, 1558, 1560, 1561, 1567, when he was elected one of the lords of the articles, and 1568. He was also a privy councillor from 1561 until 1570. His political role at the centre of Scottish government took off after he attended the Reformation Parliament of 1560. Home had previously been in the pro-French faction in Scotland, and he entertained Mary of Guise at Hume Castle in 1557. He was never destined to become a committed supporter of the protestant cause, yet like many of the Scottish &eacute;lite he dallied with Reformation politics during the late 1550s and 1560s. He sometimes appeared to play each side against the other in <i>politique</i> fashion. After the return of Mary, queen of Scots, in 1561, he continued to keep Hume Castle garrisoned for her, yet appeared to lean towards the pro-English protestant lords. And despite entertaining the queen at Hume in 1567 he became one of the rival &#145;king's men&#146; that year, supporting the faction surrounding the fledgeling James VI. During 1567 he besieged the queen, tried to arrest her husband Bothwell, and joined forces against her at the defeat of Carberry. He signed the order to imprison Mary in Lochleven Castle, witnessed her abdication, and assisted at the subsequent coronation of James VI. Home subsequently fought with Regent Moray's forces against those of the queen until she went into exile after the battle of Langside on 13 May 1568, when he apparently fought on foot and sustained many injuries. Home undoubtedly achieved greater power and influence as a result of this politicking, but he was privately unhappy about the turn of events.<br>
<br>In 1569 Home dramatically changed sides again to assist the supporters of the now exiled Queen Mary. Why he did this is unclear, but he must have felt remorse about his earlier opposition to the queen. Perhaps he had fallen out with the politically ascendant earl of Morton, whom he had stood beside at Carberry? He may also have reclaimed his Roman Catholicism, and with it an image of Mary as the victim of oppression and the rightful claimant to both the Scottish and the English thrones. The clearest manifestation of this change of heart came when Home gave shelter at Hume Castle to fugitives from the doomed English northern rising of 1569, including the countess of Northumberland, whom he treated &#145;honourablie&#146;  (T. Thomson, 154). There was a heavy price to pay for this hospitality as Queen Elizabeth then ordered the earl of Sussex to attack Hume Castle with all possible force. Home could do little to stop the English, either from taking the castle and ransacking it, or from garrisoning Hume for the next three years, gathering Lord Home's crops for their own profit without any local opposition.<br>
<br>Home had made a major political blunder, for most of his kinsmen in the Merse had remained in the king's party. The politically ambitious Homes of Manderston and Cowdenknowes, in particular, were now openly hostile, and competed with the fifth lord for power in the locality. Other lairds, more subdued in their opposition, simply refused to join him. An erroneous English report of 1570 stated that &#145;my lord Hume and almost all the gentlemen in Tevydale Marsh and Lowdyan were knitt together in such frendship&#146;  (Clifford, 2.114). In truth Home had very few friends at this time, especially among his own kinsmen. Unable to return to the Merse, he became increasingly embroiled in the affairs of the Marians during the confused years of 1570&#150;73. The centre of Scottish politics was split between king's men and Marians, with rival parliaments meeting and political leaders forfeiting each other. Home was taken prisoner in 1571 and warded in Tantallon Castle, only to be released in an exchange a few weeks later. During 1572 he demanded the return of the Hume and Fastcastle properties but without success, and in disillusion he then joined William Kirkcaldy of Grange, William Maitland of Lethington, and their supporters, in Edinburgh Castle. Home prepared himself for a lengthy siege as he took a large entourage with him, including his wife, his sister-in-law, his servitor Mr John Home, a dozen hagbutters (gunners), &#145;Marten the cooke&#146; and his two boys, a tailor, a brewer, a shoemaker, and &#145;Esabell the wessher&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/25, fols. 68&#150;9). The Edinburgh Castle Marians were then besieged for eleven days in May 1573 by Regent Morton's forces backed up by English reinforcements, until they reluctantly surrendered.<br>
<br>Home was taken prisoner and transferred to Holyrood. Morton lost no time in executing the rebels, but now the Homes of Manderston and Cowdenknowes changed their tactics, and along with Home of North Berwick successfully pleaded with Morton for Lord Home's life. Home then had to find &pound;10,000 Scots security to secure this clemency, together with a pardon for his children. As his finances were precarious, his kinsmen&#151;the lairds of Polwarth, North Berwick, Huttonhall, and Manderston&#151;obliged him as sureties when he borrowed the money from Andrew Ker of Faldonside. Home was nevertheless forfeited of his lands and titles and imprisoned back in Edinburgh Castle for the next two years. He became so ill that in June 1575 Morton released him from the castle to his lodging in Friar Wynd. Too weak to walk, Home was &#145;cariit thairto in ane bed&#146;  (T. Thomson, 348). He died there on 11 August 1575, probably having discovered the treachery of Manderston and Cowdenknowes. In his will he asked the lairds of Wedderburn, Ayton, and Polwarth to protect his widow, son, and daughters.<br>
