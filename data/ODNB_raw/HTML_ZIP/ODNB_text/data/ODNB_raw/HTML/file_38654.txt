<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson,  Allan</span>  (1815&#150;1859), <span class="occ">golfer and golfball maker</span>, was born on 11 September 1815 at St Andrews, Fife, son of David Robertson, a weaver and golfball maker, and his wife, Anne Bell. He was the third generation of feather ball (&#145;featherie&#146;) makers in St Andrews. After his father died in 1836, he took charge of the business, operating from the family home overlooking the golf links in Golf Place, St Andrews. On 16 May 1837 he married Helen Elliot. After her death on 2 September 1843, he married Jane Kyles in June 1844 in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>By 1840 the popular Allan, as he was simply known, was indisputably the best golfer in St Andrews. He was of short and stocky build and used lightweight clubs and balls with a long smooth elegant swing which described a perfect circle. His play was steady and brilliant in all aspects, with the ability to fade or draw the ball at will to suit the prevailing conditions and hazards. Always a wily character, he didn't hesitate to use these skills to confuse his opponents into making errors of judgement. He was in great demand as a caddie, teacher, and partner to the gentlemen golfers of the Union club and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (the R &amp; A). Success on the links was reflected in the sale of his featheries, which increased from 1021 in 1840 to 1392 in 1841 and 2456 in 1844. He was shrewd and canny at golf and in business too, where his golf balls were always priced slightly lower than his rivals'.<br>
<br>There was no open golf championship in Robertson's lifetime, so reputations were established by match play challenges for large sums of money supplied by the rich gentry. During the 1840s his principal rival in these matches was William Dunn, a ball and club maker from Musselburgh, against whom he remained undefeated in singles matches, including a marathon one, in July 1843, of twenty rounds at St Andrews played over ten consecutive days, excluding the sabbath. He also reigned supreme in stroke play when in September 1848 at Leven he beat his main rivals Tom Morris and William Dunn. By June 1853 the <span class="italic">Fifeshire Journal</span> acclaimed him as &#145;the real legitimate and indisputable King of Clubs&#146;.<br>
<br>When the revolutionary new gutta-percha (guttie) ball appeared about 1848, Robertson thought it would threaten his feather ball making business. Therefore, both he and his employee Tom Morris initially vowed not to use them. Later, after a dispute over Morris's use of the guttie, Morris left to start his own business as a guttie ball and club maker. Robertson soon realized his mistake and began making and using successfully the cheaper and superior gutties. He adapted his game to suit the characteristics of the new ball and is credited with being one of the first to develop the accurate pitch shot to the green using an iron-headed cleek instead of the wooden baffing spoon.<br>
<br>Robertson valued his unbeaten reputation and was selective in his opponents for the challenge matches. After turning down a &pound;100 challenge match against Tom Morris, he partnered him in 1849 when they beat the Dunn twins, James and William, over three courses for the huge sum of &pound;400. Thereafter, he avoided the big money singles matches but continued to partner Tom Morris with such success that they were unbeaten in challenge matches thereafter.<br>
<br>Although Morris and the Dunn twins took posts as &#145;keeper of the green&#146; at Prestwick and Blackheath respectively, Robertson remained faithful to St Andrews, making gutties and acting as the unofficial and unpaid professional to the R &amp; A. He refused &pound;100 challenge matches against the new young golf star William Park of Musselburgh before they met in a famous foursomes match at St Andrews when each had an amateur partner. Robertson won but only after squaring the match by holing an incredible pitch shot off the road at the seventeenth, the Road Hole. That dramatic stroke typified and reinforced his reputation for keeping cool and producing his best shots in a crisis, especially around the greens.<br>
<br>Robertson did not forget his artisan roots as he donated many prizes to the emerging golf clubs in Fife and was regularly on the links encouraging juvenile and student golfers in St Andrews. In celebration of his election as captain of the St Andrews golf club in 1853, his brother David in Sydney, Australia, sent two gold nuggets as prizes for a members' competition. David, who emigrated in 1848, was the first to introduce golf to Goulburn, Sydney, although it took another forty years or so before the first golf clubs were formed there.<br>
<br>As the leading player of the time, Robertson was frequently consulted on the layout of new courses. In 1845, along with Alexander Pirie, keeper of the green at St Andrews, he laid out the new nine-hole course at Monifieth for the newly formed Panmure Golf Club. He also supervised alterations to the Carnoustie course about 1850. His most important work was carried out at St Andrews in the winter of 1856&#150;7, when the links management committee of the R &amp; A, whose convener was the renowned St Andrews reformer Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair, was authorized to spend &pound;25 &#145;in placing the putting greens in better order under the superintendence of Allan Robertson&#146;. The improvements which they made to the course included the introduction of eighteen separate holes with their unique double greens.<br>
<br>Robertson retained his unbeaten reputation in challenge matches for large stakes until his death, but some Prestwick members claimed that Tom Morris was the superior player because he had beaten Allan in the occasional eighteen-hole friendly match. Perhaps the true answer came after two such matches in September 1858, when each claimed a victory by one hole. However, Allan was Tom's superior in stroke play, as proved that same month when his record 79, albeit in match play, was the first ever score under 80 at St Andrews. It confirmed his status as the greatest player of his time and with hindsight this great ambassador of golf could be described as &#145;the first great professional golfer&#146;. He died from jaundice on 1 September 1859, aged forty-three, at his home, Golf Place, St Andrews, Fife. The R &amp; A paid tribute in their minutes (18 September 1859) to &#145;his unrivalled skill &hellip; his unvarying civility with all classes of golfer, &hellip; his integrity and happy temper&#146;. He left an estate valued at a mere &pound;93 1<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., which prompted the Union club to open a subscription list for his widow, Jane. After the R &amp; A opened a further public subscription in 1869, an obelisk in his memory was erected in the cathedral churchyard of St Andrews, where he was buried. In 1889, while raising funds for Robertson's widow, the R &amp; A produced his final epitaph: &#145;a golfer who was never equalled in his life and has never been surpassed since his death&#146;  (ibid., 2 Sept 1889).<br>
