<span class="headword">Collins,  William</span>  (1721&#150;1759), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 25 December 1721 at Chichester, Sussex, the third of three children of William Collins (1674&#150;1733), a respectable vendor of hats and a haberdasher by trade who was twice mayor of Chichester, and Elizabeth Martin (1682&#150;1744). Educated as a gentleman, he published two slim volumes of verse by the age of twenty-five and very few poems thereafter. It is remarkable that an author who published so little&#151;some twenty poems in all&#151;before his death at the age of thirty-seven should have early acquired (and still retain) the status of an important poet. Although little is known of his life, reports of his genius, his neglect, his poverty, and his madness have attracted readers since his own day.<br>
<br>From the age of four until the age of twelve Collins was probably sent to the local prebendal school, and in 1734 (shortly after his father died) was admitted as a scholar at Winchester College, where he began lifelong friendships with Joseph Warton and with lesser writers James Hampton, John Mulso, and William Whitehead. A contemporary portrait shows a bewigged young gentleman with prominent wide-set eyes and nose and a delicate mouth. A precocious poet&#151;though no more precocious than many&#151;he published a little eight-line poem in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1739 over the pseudonym Delicatulus, and while still at Winchester is said to have begun his <span class="italic">Persian Eclogues</span>.<br>
<br>In 1740 Collins left Winchester for Oxford. Though placed first on the list for a scholarship at New College, Collins was matriculated at Queen's College on 22 March, there being no vacancy at New College, and was on 29 July elected demy at Magdalen (where his cousin William Payne was a fellow). At Oxford he continued a friendship with Warton and Mulso, and developed one with Gilbert White of Selborne. Said by Langhorne to have been distinguished both &#145;for genius and indolence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, vi), Collins like many young Oxford gentlemen wrote poems and contracted debts. But his poems&#151;the revised <span class="italic">Persian Eclogues</span>&#151;found a London publisher in January 1742. And he seems not wholly to have neglected his studies. Johnson, a serious scholar, thought Collins &#145;a man of extensive literature, and of vigorous faculties. He was acquainted not only with the learned tongues, but with the Italian, French, and Spanish languages&#146;  (Johnson, 337). Shortly after taking his BA on 18 November 1743 Collins published <span class="italic">Verses Humbly Address'd to Sir Thomas Hanmer</span> (a statesman with literary tastes) &#145;by a Gentleman of Oxford&#146; and by early 1744 had arrived in London where he was soon regarded as &#145;entirely an author&#146;  (Holt-White, 1.38), circulating a subscription, republishing his poem to Hanmer in May (this time with his name attached), and projecting a &#145;History of the revival of learning&#146;.<br>
<br>No penniless hack, Collins had a small income from freehold property inherited from a recently deceased uncle, and soon had an allowance from another uncle. After his mother's death (July 1744) and the settlement of her estate (August 1745) he had income from other inherited property. He dressed decently, and enjoyed the pleasures of the town, &#145;spending his time in all the dissipation of Ranelagh, Vauxhall, and the playhouses&#146;  (White, 11). In his London years he continued to see Mulso and Warton. He called on his cousin George Payne and apparently sought out John Hardham, a native of Chichester, now a London tobacconist and under-treasurer of Drury Lane Theatre. He made the acquaintance of writers (Samuel Johnson, John Gilbert Cooper, and John Armstrong) and actors (Garrick, Foote, Tom Davies, and James Quin). But a poet's income was uncertain: a &#145;literary adventurer&#146;  (Johnson, 335) puts himself in the hands of chance. Collins also managed his rental income imprudently, and was often in want and in debt to his landlady in King's Square Court, Soho. Despite his several ambitious literary projects (a translation of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Poetics</span>, verse tragedies, a new periodical to be called the &#145;Clarendon Review&#146;), and humbler tasks such as engaging to write brief lives for the compiler of the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, Collins had apparently not committed himself irrevocably to literature. Having been intended by his father for the church, and having successfully applied to the duke of Richmond in 1744, he was persuaded by Hardham to decline the offer of a curacy. But within a year he travelled to Flanders to seek advice and assistance from his uncle, Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Martin, who was in a position (Collins hoped) to make him chaplain in a regiment. Martin found Collins &#145;too indolent, even for the army&#146;  (Hay, 527).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, by early 1746 Collins had written perhaps three or four odes, including at least two on recent fatalities at Fontenoy and (perhaps) Falkirk. In May, at the Guildford races, he and fellow poet Joseph Warton discussed a joint publication. Collins's &#145;Ode, to a Lady, on the Death of Col. Charles Ross, in the Action at Fontenoy on 11 May 1745&#146; was published in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Museum</span> in June 1746. The collaboration was abandoned, but Collins continued to write through the summer and autumn, and on 20 December Andrew Millar published his collection of twelve <span class="italic">Odes on Several Descriptive and Allegoric Subjects</span> (Warton's odes were published by Dodsley on 4 December). Warton's odes were successful enough to go into a second edition almost immediately; Collins's sold poorly. Deeply disappointed, he later bought up unsold copies and burnt them  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, xi).<br>
<br>But Collins continued to write, though at a slower pace. By 1747 he had moved to Richmond, where he met James Thomson (Millar was his publisher, too) and John Ragsdale, and perhaps several other Scotsmen, including John Home, through their mutual friend Thomas Barrow, native of Chichester and in 1749 a resident of Winchester. When Thomson died in August 1747 Collins wrote an <span class="italic">Ode Occasion'd by the Death of Mr. Thomson</span> (1749). When Home returned to Scotland, Collins wrote (January 1750?) an &#145;Ode on his Return &amp;c&#146;, addressed to Home, published in 1788 as <span class="italic">An ode on the popular superstitions of the highlands of Scotland, considered as the subject of poetry</span>. In February and March 1750 two London journals advertised that a new poem by Collins, &#145;An Epistle to the Editor of Fairfax his Translation of Tasso's Jerusalem&#146;, was soon to be published. (It probably never appeared; no MS survives.) In November 1750 he wrote to a friend about another new poem, &#145;An Ode on the Music of the Grecian Theatre&#146;. It was perhaps never completed; only a fragment survives. He told friends he still intended to complete the &#145;History of the revival of learning&#146; and to produce the &#145;Clarendon Review&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Collins had published little new work since 1746, his odes were beginning to reach a wider audience. The &#145;Ode to a Lady&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> in July 1747. Dodsley included three of the 1746 odes in his 1748 <span class="italic">Collection</span>. (In his 1755 edition he would print the <span class="italic">Epistle to Hanmer</span> and a &#145;Song from Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline</i>&#146;.) The &#145;Song from <i>Cymbeline</i>&#146; was reprinted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in October 1749. In June 1750 Collins's <span class="italic">The Passions: an Ode for Music</span> (from the 1746 <span class="italic">Odes</span>) was performed at encaenia at Oxford, and republished as a pamphlet. His financial circumstances improved when he received a substantial inheritance (perhaps as much as &pound;2000) from his uncle Colonel Martin, who died on 19 April 1749. But by Easter 1751 Thomas Warton thought him very ill. The nature of the illness is not known, but it may already have affected both body and mind. By June he had apparently recovered, but over the next three years he travelled to Bath and to France in &#145;hopes his health might be restored&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Reaper</span>, 484). When Johnson saw him in lodgings in Islington, on his return from France, Collins had &#145;withdrawn from study&#146;. As he told Johnson, &#145;I have but one book [an English <span class="roman">New Testament</span>] but that is the best&#146;  (Johnson, 339).<br>
<br>What Johnson called &#145;depression of mind&#146;  (Johnson, 338) continued to afflict Collins intermittently, and he was for a time confined to McDonald's madhouse in Chelsea, from which his sister Anne removed him in 1754, to take him back to Chichester. His sister Elizabeth died there in June. The Wartons visited him in the cathedral cloisters, where he and his sister lived, in September 1754. There they saw the manuscript &#145;Ode to a Friend&#146; and received from Collins a revised draft of the <span class="italic">Persian Eclogues</span> and a number of poetic fragments. Preserved in Thomas Warton's papers at Trinity College, Oxford, and not published until 1956, all but one fragment appear to date from 1744&#150;6. In November Collins travelled to Oxford for a change of scene and perhaps to relieve his depression. He took lodgings across from Christ Church, where Thomas Warton saw him &#145;labouring under the most deplorable langour of body and dejection of mind&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 276n.) and Gilbert White saw him &#145;under Merton wall, &hellip; struggling and conveyed by force, in the arms of two or three men, towards the parish of St. Clement, in which was a house that took in such unhappy objects&#146;  (White, 11).<br>
<br>Of Collins's final years very little is known. He apparently remained at Chichester and may have continued revising his <span class="italic">Eclogues</span>. A second edition was called for&#151;Joseph Warton reported that Collins was &#145;greatly mortified&#146; that the <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> &#145;found more readers and admirers than his Odes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</span>, 1.115)&#151;and the retitled <span class="italic">Oriental Eclogues</span> were published in 1757, perhaps under the supervision of Warton. Collins continued to speak to the Warton brothers of his unfinished &#145;History&#146;. During his final illness, though &#145;accustomed to rave much&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Reaper</span>, 479) he was calmed by listening to a servant read from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Collins died in Chichester on 12 June 1759, and was buried on 15 June in St Andrew's Church in East Street. A tablet by Flaxman to his memory was erected in the cathedral in 1795.<br>
<br>In stature Collins was &#145;somewhat above the middle size&#146; with &#145;keen, expressive eyes, and a fixed, sedate aspect, which from intense thinking, had contracted an habitual frown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, xiv). He was &#145;very temperate in his eating and drinking&#146;, his grey eyes &#145;so weak at times as hardly to bear a candle in the room; and often raising within him apprehensions of blindness&#146;  (White, 11). He never married, though this is perhaps not remarkable; his two sisters remained unmarried until the ages of forty-six and fifty respectively. One contemporary reported that the &#145;Ode to a Lady&#146; was addressed to Elizabeth Goddard of Harting, Sussex, with whom the poet had fallen in love  (Wendorf and Ryskamp, 144). Langhorne thought it &#145;very remarkable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, p. xv) that the passion of love should be omitted from Collins's <span class="italic">The Passions</span>.<br>
<br>About the symptoms of Collins's nervous disorder contemporary observers agree in referring both to a &#145;langour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</span>, 276n.) or &#145;depression of spirits&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, xiii), &#145;general laxity and feebleness, a deficiency rather of his vital than intellectual powers&#146;  (Johnson, 340), and (in his last years) to occasional &#145;great moanings&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Reaper</span>, 479). Its essential nature is impossible to identify, but this has not prevented biographers from attributing it variously to &#145;poetical disappointments&#146;  (D'Israeli, 200), poverty, the &#145;enthusiasm of poetry&#146; itself  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, ii), or from linking it with Collins's &#145;indolence&#146; at Oxford, &#145;want of steadiness&#146;, and &#145;dissipation&#146; in London. A modern medical expert suggests &#145;depressive psychosis&#146;  (Ober, 153). It now seems clear that his madness did not appear until about 1751, that it recurred, that it left him lucid intervals, and that none of his poems was written under its influence. Contemporary references to his poverty are not inconsistent with modern findings that Collins squandered his legacies. Contemporary references from Goldsmith, John Gilbert Cooper, and James Grainger to his neglect support the view that his work was often reprinted and was admired by fellow writers: Collins's ambitions were high, and both he and his early admirers thought he deserved more attention. Wider fame dates from Langhorne's 1765 edition.<br>
<br>Collins has long served literary historians as a representative of his mid-century poetic generation and an acute register of their sensibility. Critical accounts depend on how one views the age. Still regarded by some as a typical &#145;pre-Romantic&#146; who reacted against the moralizing poetry of the &#145;Augustans&#146;, Collins took Pope for his own model in his early work. Said to have displayed acute anxiety about the overbearing influence of Milton, he displayed remarkable urbanity, originality, and lofty confidence in his abilities. Identified as a solipsistic bard of an age of graveyard poets, his back turned on the world of history, he is also the author of a set of patriotic odes that engage topics of contemporary war and peace, liberty, and mercy to the Jacobite rebels.<br>
