<span class="headword">Brill,  Kenneth Henry</span>  (1911&#150;1991), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 13 April 1911 at 28 Rectory Road, Barnes, Surrey, the elder of the two sons of Percy Henry Archelaus Thomas Brill (1881&#150;1918), schoolteacher, and his wife, Charlotte Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crisp (1882&#150;1940), also a schoolteacher and later headmistress of Kilve School, Somerset. Brill, brought up by his mother after his father died in the First World War, was educated at Bristol grammar school, which he left, aged sixteen, after an undistinguished school career. After a time as a trainee surveyor in Somerset he moved to London, where he lived in an East End settlement. There he became involved in the parish of a radical Anglican priest, St John Beverley Groser, and joined campaigns to support the Jarrow marchers, to fight slum landlords, and to challenge Mosley's blackshirts. This radicalism was reinforced when he met Jessica Atkinson (1915&#150;1990), daughter of Frederick Atkinson, commercial traveller; they married on 21 August 1938 and shared a lifelong commitment to Christianity, socialism, and (later) social work. They had one daughter, Judi. Meanwhile Brill trained at the London School of Economics as a probation officer and psychiatric social worker but the Second World War interrupted his social work career. He volunteered for the Royal Air Force and served as a flight sergeant and navigator (one who frequently found it difficult to follow the map, he confessed).<br>
<br>After the war Brill worked for MIND (the National Association for Mental Health) while serving as a Labour councillor in Haringey. The creation of children's departments in 1948 offered him an opportunity to bring together his commitment to children, his organizing ability, and his vision of a better future in the role of children's officer. His first appointment was in Croydon, after which he moved to Devon, where he worked for thirteen years; his final post as children's officer was in Barnet. Children's departments were an organizational response to the vulnerability and potential for abuse of a virtually unregulated foster care system. The drive that Brill brought to his successive appointments was founded on the needs of children as individuals, not cases. His pioneering approach saw a dramatic reduction in the numbers of children in residential care. The emphasis of all the departments in which he worked was switched to family support. Initially Brill could seem austere and distant; his concern for detail and his meticulous drafting sharply differentiated him from those social workers whose concern for humanity outran their concern for organization and order. As secretary of the Association of Children's Officers for seventeen years he used his great organizational skills to the benefit of a national body. The association supported the development of a unified social work profession, which came into being with the <span class="roman">Local Authority Social Services Act</span> of 1970.<br>
<br>The British Association of Social Workers (BASW) was established as a professional association in 1970. Brill was a logical choice for the first general secretary and brought a natural authority to the role as well as a rich knowledge of the history of the fledgeling profession. He succeeded in welding together a number of disparate professional groups. During his time as general secretary BASW was at its zenith, with over 1000 members attending its annual general meetings. The pressures of the job were immense, with a demanding membership, fast developing social services, and (latterly) daily commuting from London to Birmingham, where the association decided to relocate&#151;a decision fully supported by Brill despite the personal consequences. Throughout this period his drive and energy seemed inexhaustible. Then, at the age of sixty-three, when his contemporaries were pursuing retirement activities, he startled the social work world by returning to Barnet as director of social services. He took on the post during a strike and characteristically led from the top by personally undertaking emergency duty out of hours.<br>
<br>Conventional retirement was never likely to appeal to Brill. He served as clerk to the Council of National Voluntary Child Care Organisations, edited the newsletter of the Devon branch of BASW, was active in his parish council and in local organizations, and registered for a PhD at the University of Birmingham. The subject of his study was the development of children's services from the Curtis report of 1946 to the <span class="roman">Children Act</span> of 1989. Despite failing health he completed his thesis and received his doctorate in Birmingham two days before his death, at his home, Dunns Cottage, Cheriton Fitzpaine, Devon, on 16 December 1991. He was survived by his daughter, his wife having died in the previous year. He was buried at Cheriton Fitzpaine on 2 January 1992. In the course of a long and active working life Brill helped to shape the new profession of social work. His commitment to quality in child care was an inspiration to those who knew and worked with him.<br>
