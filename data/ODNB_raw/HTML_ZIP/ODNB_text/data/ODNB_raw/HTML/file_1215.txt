<span class="headword">Ball,  John</span>  (1585&#150;1640), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born at Cassington, Oxfordshire, in early October 1585, the son of William Ball and his wife, Agnes Mabet. Although in humble circumstances, his parents sent him to a private school in the neighbouring village of Yarnton. Such were his &#145;scholastical gifts&#146;  (Clarke, 152) that in his fifteenth year he obtained a place as a servitor at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 24 October 1600. He subsequently transferred to St Mary Hall and graduated BA on 24 January 1604.<br>
<br>Lacking the means to continue his university studies, however, Ball became tutor to the children of Lady Cholmondeley in Cheshire, a formative experience, since he now came into contact with a group of &#145;severe Puritans&#146;  (Clarke, 152) who made such a deep impression on him through their fervent prayers, fasting, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> readings that he felt increasingly called to the ministry. Determined to obtain Anglican ordination without subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, in 1610 he and his lifelong friend Julines Herring succeeded, owing to the compliance of an Irish bishop. Ball now settled at Whitmore, a chapel of ease in the parish of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, where he served as the curate for the next thirty years. His stipend was only &pound;20 per annum, and although he also kept a school, at which he was apparently successful, he remained poor. He bore this with great fortitude, despite lacking even a house of his own when he first moved to Whitmore. For &#145;many years&#146;  (Clarke, 148) he lived at Whitmore Hall as a guest of the patron of the living, Edward Mainwaring, until the latter built a small cottage for him in the village. On 4 August 1612, at Whitmore Chapel, Ball married Ellen Buckenhall, with whom he had six sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>According to Simeon Ashe's dedication to Ball's <span class="italic">The Power of Godliness</span> (1657), the latter led an obscure if conscientious life in his parish, but eventually such were &#145;his high parts&#146; and &#145;eminent piety&#146; that he was &#145;owned, approved and honoured&#146; throughout the land. Towards the end of his life Ball moved in fairly exalted circles, having contacts with puritan peers like Edward Montagu, Viscount Kimbolton, and Lord Saye and Sele. He is also known to have preached sermons before Lady Margaret Bromley at Sheriff Hales in Shropshire; to have attended a conference of puritan clergy in Warwick Castle at the invitation of Lord Brooke; and to have engaged in theological disputation at Fawsley, Northamptonshire, with a clerical colleague of a sectarian persuasion in the presence of Richard Knightley, John Pym, and others.<br>
<br>As a known nonconformist Ball suffered from &#145;prelatical persecution&#146;  (Clarke, 150) throughout his ministry; indeed, he was reputedly deprived of a living in Cheshire before securing that at Whitmore as well as suffering two periods of confinement, and in the late 1630s he seriously considered emigration to New England but was dissuaded by John Dod, a fellow clergyman. With the summoning of the Short Parliament in the spring of 1640 Ball travelled to London with his clerical associate Thomas Langley, to lobby &#145;some Parliament men&#146;  (ibid., 153) against the Laudian harassment of men of their religious ilk. But though Ball entertained hopes of &#145;further Reformation of things woefully out of order&#146;  (ibid.) in the established church, his hopes were dashed with the premature dissolution of that assembly and he was forced to return home with a heavy heart. Ball now fell seriously ill and after a &#145;languishing sicknesse&#146;  (ibid., 155) died at his house at Stoke Whitmore, Staffordshire, on 20 October 1640. He was buried in Whitmore Chapel. A man of &#145;a sweet, humble, peaceable spirit&#146;  (ibid., 154), Ball was eulogized by diverse contemporaries, but perhaps the most eloquent tribute came from Richard Baxter, who declared that Ball merited &#145;as high esteem and honour as the best bishop in England&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.671).<br>
<br>Ball was a prolific author, though few of his works saw the light of day before 1640. At least five of his manuscript treatises were published posthumously by his &#145;bosom friend&#146;  (Clarke, 152) and literary executor, Simeon Ashe. Of his eight major works, the most popular was the first, <span class="italic">A Short Treatise Containing All the Principal Grounds of Christian Religion</span>, which went through fourteen editions before 1632 and was even translated into Turkish. Its dialogic form epitomized Ball's &#145;plaine and naturall style&#146;  (preface). Ball's <span class="italic">Treatise of Faith</span> (1631) was commended to the reader by Richard Sibbes who thought its author &#145;deserved well of the church&#146;  (foreword). Undoubtedly the most substantive work was his <span class="italic">A Friendly Triall of the Grounds Tending to Separation</span> (1640). Written in the first instance &#145;for (the) satisfaction of Mr Richard Knightley&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.671), this expressed the disquiet felt by Ball for the growing sectarian tendencies within puritanism. By robustly championing the legitimacy of &#145;a stinted liturgy&#146; and set forms of prayer in church services Ball incurred the wrath of his stricter brethren who accused him of &#145;deserting the non-conformist cause&#146;  (ibid.), a charge which surfaced again after the publication in 1642 of his refutation of the ideas of the separatist leader John Canne. Entitled <span class="italic">An Answer to Two Treatises of Mr John Can</span>, this sought to demonstrate that, for all its imperfections, nothing justified outright separation from the Church of England. <span class="italic">A Tryall of the New-Church Way in New England and in Old</span> (1644) was inspired by the theological controversies which arose in the wake of nine queries submitted by Ball on behalf of the English puritan clergy to their counterparts in the Bay Colony about 1637. In this dispute Ball took exception to those &#145;tenets&#146; in New England puritanism which &#145;drew men to seperation&#146;  (p. 8) and again insisted that there were no possible grounds for deserting the English church whose institutional failings he attributed to &#145;human fraility&#146;  (p. 13). <span class="italic">Treatise of the Covenant of Grace</span> (1645), <span class="italic">The Power of Godliness</span> (1657), and <span class="italic">Treatise of Divine Meditation</span> (1660) were typical products of Ball's pen, possessing &#145;more of solidity than lustre, of use than show&#146;  (<span class="italic">Treatise of Divine Meditation</span>, second preface). Ball's religious outlook is difficult to categorize: paradoxically he was labelled by one contemporary &#145;the Presbyterians' Champion&#146; and by another as belonging to the &#145;tribe&#146; of Independents, a confusion caused by his own writings, a careful reading of which suggests that he was a &#145;non-separating Puritan&#146; whose ideal church was a &#145;congregational presbytery&#146;  (Schneider, 171, 173, 179&#150;180).<br>
