<span class="headword">Phillips,  Charles</span>  (1786/7?&#150;1859), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born at Sligo, in Ireland, the son of William Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1800), a publican and town councillor. His age was recorded as fifteen years old when he was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1802, and he graduated BA in 1806. On 30 October 1807 he entered the Middle Temple in London, and was called to the Irish bar in February 1812. He joined the Connaught circuit and quickly made a reputation through his extravagant forensic speeches, a number of which he published as <span class="italic">The Speeches of Charles Phillips</span>, in 1817. He had a grand style, explosive in pace and overflowing in superlatives, metaphor, and vivid expression, though he lacked the tact of a first-class advocate. His style attracted two critical articles by Henry Brougham in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, to which Phillips responded in two open letters to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and in the preface to <span class="italic">Specimens of Irish Eloquence</span>, which he edited in 1819. Other contemporary critics, including William Hazlitt, Christopher North, and Sir James MacKintosh, have left their impressions of his style.<br>
<br>While a student in the Middle Temple, Phillips began his literary writing, and over the next decade he published a number of poems, and some speeches and articles on contemporary political questions. One poem, &#145;The Emerald Isle&#146;, gained Phillips an invitation to the table of the distinguished Irish advocate and judge John Philpot Curran. On Curran's death Phillips wrote a warm biographical tribute, entitled <span class="italic">Recollections of Curran and some of his Contemporaries</span>. This was Phillips's most enduring literary work, running to five editions between 1818 and 1857.<br>
<br>In November 1819 Phillips married a Miss Whalley of Camden Town, London; they had one daughter and two sons. By this time Phillips had left Ireland for England; he was called in February 1821 to the English bar, where he prospered only in criminal cases, though in this field he was highly successful. By the mid-1830s, a contemporary barrister later recalled that Phillips:<blockquote>was signally the prisoners' counsel at the Old Bailey, the Middlesex sessions, and also upon the Oxford circuit. In this capacity he was certainly at that time unrivalled. He had great readiness, a power of repartee, earnestness when it was required; and whatever deficiency he may have shown in his earlier career, he had acquired a very sound judgment. He was never dull and the juries liked him. (Ballantine, 1.87)</blockquote>By the beginning of the 1830s Phillips had formed a friendship with Henry Brougham, who soon became lord chancellor, and they corresponded on legal and political questions from this time until Phillips's death. More than 600 of their letters survive among the Brougham papers in the library of University College, London, and these form a particularly valuable archive of the reforms to criminal procedure of the 1830s. Phillips assisted Lord Brougham in the preparation of the <span class="roman">Central Criminal Court Act</span> (1834) and encouraged him to create a salaried public prosecutor for this court. He strongly opposed the <span class="roman">Prisoners' Counsel Act</span> (1836), both in private correspondence with Lord Brougham and publicly in evidence before a select committee of the House of Lords. He considered that this act would turn criminal trials into contests of skill between counsel, and subject human life and liberty to forensic sophistry.<br>
<br>Phillips was defence counsel under the procedure established by this act in the sensational murder trial of Courvoisier in 1840. On the second day of his trial Courvoisier confessed his guilt to Phillips but insisted on continuing with his plea of not guilty. Phillips's speech to the jury included some scathing attacks on prosecution witnesses, and a number of rhetorical references to things divine. After the trial he was accused of irresponsibility and abuse of his position as an advocate. Other controversial advocacy during the 1840s periodically revived discussion of his defence of Courvoisier. Eventually on 20 November 1849 Phillips defended his conduct in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In retrospect Courvoisier is a landmark case in the development of professional ethics. The better view is that Phillips did not transgress the bounds of his professional duty, but that some passages of his speech were unwise and distasteful.<br>
<br>In 1842 Phillips was appointed as a commissioner of the bankruptcy court at Liverpool, where his time was marred by difficulties with his fellow judge and by the death of one of his sons. In 1846 he returned to London as a commissioner of the insolvent debtors' court. In 1857 he produced the widely read pamphlet <span class="italic">Vacation Thoughts on Capital Punishment</span>, which urged the total abolition of the death penalty. Phillips died at 39 Gordon Square, London, on 1 February 1859, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Phillips's sensitive and imaginative nature inspired the romanticism of his writing, and the eloquence and exaggerations of his advocacy. His sensitivity and a certain lack of moral courage meant that he was easily wounded by criticism, over-ready to justify himself, and susceptible to lapses of judgement under pressure. He was not a great advocate, though significant for the success he achieved with a forensic style which, by English standards, was unusually passionate and rhetorical. He was a tall man, with expressive features and a good speaking voice.<br>
