<span class="headword">Statham,  Francis Reginald</span>  (1844&#150;1908), <span class="occ">journalist in South Africa</span>, was born on 6 February 1844 at Everton, Liverpool, the fourth son of Henry Heathcote Statham, a solicitor, and his wife, Irene Elisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Horner. The architectural writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53632/', "Henry Heathcote Statham")</script> was his eldest brother. On account of his health he received a large part of his education from private tutors, but he also attended both Liverpool Collegiate Institute and Windermere College. After leaving school he entered the cotton business in Liverpool, joining the firm of Rylands &amp; Co. This was at a time of enormous speculation in cotton, owing to the American Civil War, and in November 1865 Statham, suffering from what he later described as an &#145;over-balanced mind&#146;, absconded with &pound;2500 of the firm's money. Accompanied by a dancer from one of the local theatres, he fled to the continent under an assumed name. Pursued by a member of the Liverpool police rather improbably disguised as a Roman Catholic priest, the couple were finally caught at Lugano and agreed to return to England. There Statham was arrested, and, although he returned most of the money, he was sentenced to eighteen months with hard labour. His natural hypersensitivity was heightened by this experience, and later found expression in his novel <span class="italic">The Fiery Furnace</span> (1895). After his release he married, on 31 October 1870, Margaretta Dalton (<i>b</i>. 1845), with whom he had at least five children.<br>
<br>In gaol Statham underwent something of a religious conversion and in 1871 he became a lay preacher to an independent congregation in Edinburgh. He also began to write poetry; his <span class="italic">Alice Rushton and Other Poems</span> appeared in 1868, and <span class="italic">Glaphyra and Other Poems</span> two years later. However he soon turned to journalism and became assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Albion</span>, before going to South Africa to become editor of the <span class="italic">Natal Witness</span> in 1877. His premise was &#145;One man, with justice on his side, is a majority&#146;; this made him both independent and fearless, but it also made him an awkward customer, and even some of those who should have been his natural allies found him difficult to deal with. As a severe critic of British imperial policy in South Africa, and an advocate of better relations with the Boers, it is not surprising that he offended officials in the Colonial Office, but even people as antipathetic to government policy as the Colensos found him a difficult ally. Frances Colenso accurately described him as &#145;a keen knife liable to shut upon the hand that used it, and therefore to be used with caution&#146;  (letter to F. W. Chesson, 23 July 1884, Anti-Slavery Society papers, Bodl. RH, file C130/40).<br>
<br>In December 1879 Statham resigned from the <span class="italic">Natal Witness</span> to become editor of the <span class="italic">Cape Post</span>. When this closed down the following year he returned to England, where he wrote <span class="italic">Blacks, Boers and British: a Three-Cornered Problem</span> (1881), in which he advocated reconciliation between the British and the Boers in South Africa. In 1881 he returned to South Africa to become editor of the <span class="italic">Natal Witness</span> for the second time, but was forced to resign in 1887, following the revelation of his criminal past in Liverpool, and an unsuccessful defence against a libel action brought against the paper by John Wesley Shepstone over its coverage of his policies in Zululand. After a brief period in England&#151;where he attempted, unsuccessfully, to clear his name&#151;he became editor of the <span class="italic">Natal Advertiser</span> in Durban.<br>
<br>In 1891 Statham became editor of <span class="italic">The Independent</span> in Kimberley and remained there until the paper closed in 1893. During this period he gathered the material needed to write his novel <span class="italic">Mr Magnus</span> (1896), a devastating expos&eacute; of Cecil Rhodes and the monopolistic policies of De Beers. In his factual writings he was hardly less vitriolic. In <span class="italic">South Africa as It Is</span> (1897) he described the granting of the charter to Rhodes's British South Africa Company as &#145;the most extraordinary usurpation of power ever perpetrated since the Popes gave over the Peruvians into the hands of Pizarro&#146;.<br>
<br>Statham returned to England in 1895 where, funded by the Netherlands Railway Company, he acted as a propagandist for the Transvaal republic, writing a series of articles in the weekly <span class="italic">South Africa</span> on &#145;Blacks, Boers and British&#146;. These were followed by his books <span class="italic">Paul Kruger and his Times</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">The South African Crisis: the Truth about the Transvaal</span> (1899). During the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 his pro-Boer sympathies once again got him into trouble with the authorities. The Colonial Office asked the Post Office to watch his mail, and the Metropolitan Police were asked to tail him on the grounds that he was possibly a Boer spy. No evidence of this was ever forthcoming.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Statham attempted, without success, to become a music professor. A minor composer, he wrote a cantata, <span class="italic">Prosperity and Praise</span>, for the international exhibition at Kimberley in 1892, followed by another, <span class="italic">Vasco da Gama</span>, published in 1895. He also wrote anthems for all four South African territories. He died of kidney failure at his home, 2 Ruskin Avenue, Kew, Surrey, on 4 March 1908.<br>
