<span class="headword">Gunn,  Herbert Smith <span class="st"> [Bert]</span></span>  (1903&#150;1962), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born on 3 April 1903 at 225 Old Road, West Gravesend, Kent, the younger son of Herbert Gunn, merchant seaman and marine engineer, and his wife, Alice Eliza Smith. Nothing is known about his education. In 1920 Bert Gunn began his training as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Kent Messenger</span> but, only twenty-one years old, he headed for the Far East, getting a job as a sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Straits Times</span> in Singapore. A year later he returned to England to join the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>. He followed this with sub-editing stints on the London <span class="italic">Evening News</span> (1929) and the London <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> (1931). On 12 September 1925 he married Annie Charlotte, known as Ann (1903&#150;1944), daughter of Alexander Thomson, a farmer. The couple had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93565/', "Thomson William (Thom) Gunn (1929&#150;2004)")</script>, poet, and Alexander (Ander) Gunn (<i>b</i>. 1931), photographer.<br>
<br>Gunn's abilities soon attracted the attention of Arthur Christiansen, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and as a result in 1936 he became its first northern editor in Manchester. He later transferred to London as assistant editor and then between 1943 and 1944 was managing editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. It was there that he created the headline referring to Hitler as &#145;It's that man again&#146;, which afterwards became the title for Tommy Handley's long-running radio show <span class="italic">ITMA</span>. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 29 January 1944 Gunn married Margaret Olive Melville Edwards (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), who was a reporter on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. She was the daughter of James Alexander Melville Brown, a company director, and the divorced wife of Philip Osbert Clifford Edwards. The couple had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1944 Lord Beaverbrook appointed Gunn editor of the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in succession to Michael Foot, but it eventually became apparent there was a fundamental clash between them on editorial strategy. Gunn wanted to edit a popular paper, Beaverbrook wanted it to appeal mainly to the City and West End audiences. Their differences came to a head when, in 1950, with the Labour government returned for a second term, Beaverbrook suggested a malicious diary paragraph about John Strachey, secretary of state for war, indicating that his communist past made his loyalty questionable. Unfortunately Gunn promoted this to a front-page splash which emphasized the scurrility of the piece and led to a further clash with Beaverbook.<br>
<br>Gunn was also in trouble when a Labour MP said in an article in the trade press that newspapers were paying MPs for information about private meetings of the Labour Party. The committee of privileges investigated the matter and under pressure from the attorney-general Bert Gunn revealed that the MP who wrote the article, Garry Allighan, was himself the source of stories paid for by the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. This led to Allighan's enforced resignation from the house.<br>
<br>In 1952, no longer wishing to continue battling with Beaverbrook, Gunn resigned from the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> and was quickly recruited by the second Lord Rothermere to join Associated Newspapers. A year later Rothermere appointed him editor of the ailing <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, and within six years Bert Gunn had doubled its circulation. One of his most significant appointments then was that of David English as features editor. Vere Harmsworth was the managing director of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> at the time, and thus Bert Gunn was instrumental in launching the highly successful friendship and collaboration of David English and Vere Harmsworth who, between them, were eventually to transform the fortunes of Associated Newspapers.<br>
<br>In December 1959 Bert Gunn was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span> but when, for commercial reasons, it was merged with the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> in 1961 he was very upset. By this time his health was failing, and the merger triggered his early resignation from the Associated Newspaper Group in 1962.<br>
<br>Herbert Gunn was a superb newspaper craftsman whose technical abilities were not always matched by editorial judgement. A newspaperman through and through, held in high regard by his colleagues, he was brilliant at turning a news story into an eye-catching page layout. Though professionally tough, personally Gunn was the kindest of men, giving particular encouragement to the younger members of his staff. Tall, silver-haired, with a prematurely lined face and immaculate clothes, he was more like a visiting diplomat than a newspaperman. He smoked too much, drank too much, slept very little, yet had amazing energy.<br>
<br>As a one-time president of the Institute of Journalists, Gunn went on record as a staunch upholder of the freedom of the press. He none the less had an uneasy relationship with the Press Council, which criticized him over a number of breaches of good taste and good manners. For example, he ignored a request from Princess Marina to regard the party for the coming of age of her son as a private occasion. As a result, after censure from the Press Council, he had to apologize to both the queen and Princess Marina. However, in every case where he was criticized he published the Press Council findings in a prominent position in the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>.<br>
<br>During his retirement Gunn helped his wife launch a women's magazine, but this folded after very few issues. Theirs was a particularly happy marriage which lasted until his death from cancer on 2 March 1962 at his London home, the Coach House, 32 Somerset Road, Wimbledon. One of the sons from his first marriage was Thom Gunn (1929&#150;2004), the poet.<br>
