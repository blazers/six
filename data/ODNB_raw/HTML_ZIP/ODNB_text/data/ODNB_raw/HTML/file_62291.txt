<span class="headword">Daubeney family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1225&#150;<em>c.</em>1510), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, of Somerset and Bedfordshire, came originally from Brittany, their name deriving from the town of Aubign&eacute; in the diocese of Rennes. By the 1220s, in addition to their Breton estates, the family held property in Lincolnshire, around South Ingleby. At some time before 1225, King Henry III granted the Somerset manor of South Petherton to Philip Daubeney, seigneur de Landal (<i>d</i>. 1236). This manor soon became their main English seat. In 1236 Philip died in the Holy Land, leaving as his heir a nephew, Sir Ralph Daubeney (<i>d</i>. 1292). Sir Ralph was in turn succeeded by his two sons: Sir Philip Daubeney (<i>d</i>. 1294) and <a name="cosubject_62290"></a><span class="headword">Elis Daubeney</span>, Lord Daubeney  (<em>c.</em>1270&#150;1305)<span class="occ"></span>. Elis made two significant contributions to the family's interests. First, he determined that their attentions would focus on England rather than his own birthplace of Brittany, their primary sphere of influence hitherto; and in 1295 Edward I granted a charter naturalizing Elis and his heirs in perpetuity. Second, Sir Elis was the first member of the family to rise to a position of national prominence. After serving in Edward I's campaign against the Welsh rebel Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294&#150;5, he received personal summonses to parliament until his death in 1305. He also took an active part in King Edward's campaigns against the Scots. He married Joan, with whom he had twin sons, <a name="cosubject_62291"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph Daubeney</span>  (<em>c.</em>1304&#150;1378)<span class="occ"></span> and Sir William Daubeney (<i>c</i>.1304&#150;<i>c</i>.1372). On Sir Elis's death, the crown took possession of most of his lands during Ralph's minority, his Lincolnshire properties being assigned to Joan as her dower.<br>
<br>In 1326 Ralph Daubeney was granted livery of his family's English estates, while his brother, William, took possession of the Breton properties, becoming seigneur de Landal. Thereafter, these two spheres of Daubeney interest remained separate. Following the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1337, William's branch of the family ran into difficulties as a result of their English associations, and in 1373 Edward III granted Sir William's widow, Phillipa, &pound;50 per annum until she recovered her Breton lands, which had been confiscated owing to her alleged English allegiance. Ralph, by contrast, had no such difficulties and went on to carve out a successful career. Like his father he served in the wars in Scotland, where he was knighted and appointed a knight-banneret. At some time after 1330 he was taken prisoner by the Scots and was not released until October 1337. Despite this setback, Ralph resumed his career upon release and in February 1342 was admitted to the royal council, though he apparently never received an individual writ of summons to parliament. In 1346 he fought in the bishop of Durham's retinue at Cr&eacute;cy, and he subsequently took part in the successful siege of Calais. Ralph was married twice: his first wife was Alice, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19000/', "William Montagu, second Lord Montagu")</script>, of Shepton Montague, Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1319), and his second was Katherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27417/', "Marmaduke (III) Thwing, first Lord Thwing (d. 1323)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27418/', "Thwing, Sir Robert (III) (d. 1245x)")</script>].<br>
<br>Sir Ralph Daubeney was succeeded by <a name="cosubject_62292"></a><span class="headword">Sir Giles [i] Daubeney</span>  (<em>c.</em>1333&#150;1386)<span class="occ"></span>, his son from his first marriage. Even before his father's death, Giles had begun building up his own estates, in 1357 purchasing the manors of Kempston, Bedfordshire, and Tottenham, Middlesex, for 200 marks from his uncle, Sir William Daubeney. These properties subsequently provided the descendants of Giles [i] with an important secondary sphere of influence, and in the years before his father's death Giles was active in Bedfordshire administration, serving as a justice of oyer and terminer there several times in the 1370s, and as sheriff in 1379&#150;80. Thereafter, having received his inheritance in 1378, his interests returned to his native Somerset, and he served as MP from 1382 to 1384. He died in June 1386 at his manor of Barrington, near South Petherton. His commitment to his midland estates is, however, suggested by the fact that he was buried at Kempston.<br>
<br>If the Daubeneys' decline from the heights of influence which Sir Elis had scaled was relatively slow during the seventy years after his death, in subsequent decades it accelerated, largely owing to the minorities and early deaths which beset the family from the late fourteenth century. In 1358 Sir Giles [i] Daubeney had married Alianore, daughter of Sir Henry Willington of Umberleigh, Devon. The marriage produced a son, <a name="cosubject_62293"></a><span class="headword">Sir Giles [ii] Daubeney</span>  (1370&#150;1403)<span class="occ"></span>, aged sixteen at his father's death. During his minority his lands were farmed by Margaret Courtenay, countess of Devon, while his marriage was granted to Thomas Lee, one of the king's esquires. In 1390 Giles [ii] was assigned &pound;20 per annum from his lands for his maintenance, and at the end of 1391 he was granted livery. Over the following years he was active in Bedfordshire, where he served as sheriff in 1394&#150;5 and again in 1400. He died in 1403 at Kempston, where he was buried. From his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Sir John Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1388?), Giles had two sons. The elder was <a name="cosubject_62294"></a><span class="headword">John Daubeney</span>  (<em>c.</em>1394&#150;1409)<span class="occ"></span>, whose wardship the king granted to his consort, Joan of Navarre. John married Elizabeth, daughter of the Yorkshire knight Roger Scrope, but died in 1409 before he could produce any offspring. His heir was his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_62295"></a><span class="headword">Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney</span>  (1399&#150;1446)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>By the time Giles [iii] Daubeney took possession of his inheritance, minorities had deprived his family of more than twenty years' estate income and prevented them from playing the active role in local and national affairs which, a century before, had enabled Sir Elis and Sir Ralph temporarily to elevate the Daubeneys above the county gentry. By these minorities they had also been denied the opportunity to benefit from royal patronage, or to profit in the land and marriage markets. Their position began to improve after Sir Giles [iii] took possession of the family lands in 1416. Within two years he was in France, and campaigned there until 1421, but was apparently not among the beneficiaries of the Lancastrian land settlement in Normandy and returned to England in order to enhance his existing interests. Most of his official activities were connected with Somerset, where he served as sheriff in 1426, MP in 1424&#150;5 and 1429, and on a variety of <i>ad hoc</i> commissions from the late 1420s. He was also active in the administration of Bedfordshire (where he had been born), serving as sheriff there in 1431&#150;2. He also expanded his estates. After the death of his first wife, Joan, daughter of Philip, Lord Darcy (<i>d</i>. 1399), Giles married Mary, daughter and coheir of Simon Leke of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, thereby acquiring the manors of Cotham and Hawton and tenements in Newark.<br>
<br>Upon his death in 1446, Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney was succeeded by his eldest son with his first wife, <a name="cosubject_62296"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Daubeney</span>  (1424&#150;1461)<span class="occ"></span>, who followed his father in marrying an heiress, in his case Alice (<i>b</i>. 1432), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61258/', "John Stourton (d. 1438)")</script> of Preston Plucknett, Somerset [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52797/', "Stourton family")</script>]. As a result of this marriage, considerable estates in Somerset, worth in excess of &pound;80 per annum and including the manors of Yeovilton, Speckington, and Bridgehampton, came to the family. Having been knighted, William served as MP for Bedfordshire in 1448&#150;9 and as sheriff of Cornwall in 1452&#150;3, but does not appear to have been personally involved in the factional strife then besetting the government of Henry VI. Indeed, after 1453 Sir William performed no further official service, perhaps being content to keep his head below the parapet.<br>
<br>Sir William's son and heir was altogether less reticent, and raised the family's fortunes to their medieval pinnacle. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7185/', "Giles Daubeney, first Baron Daubeney (1451/2&#150;1508)")</script>, was brought up a Yorkist and served Edward IV, but rebelled against Richard III in 1483 and fled to Brittany where he joined Henry Tudor. Having fought at Bosworth, he became one of Henry's closest associates and, through a series of grants, the dominant magnate in the south-west. In March 1486 Henry created him a baron. He served as a councillor, administrator, diplomat, and, from 1495, as lord chamberlain. Contemporary accusations of wavering loyalty during the western rebellion of 1497 (which he nevertheless helped to put down), and the fine imposed on him by the king in 1506, suggest that there were some strains in his relations with Henry. Nevertheless, on his death in May 1508 he was given a splendid funeral in Westminster Abbey, where alabaster effigies of him and his wife survive. He had married, by 1476, Elizabeth, daughter of John Arundel of Lanherne and his second wife, Katherine Chidiock. They had one daughter, Cecily, who married John Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarine, later second earl of Bath (<i>d</i>. 1539), and a son, Henry Daubeney, who was created earl of Bridgewater by Henry VIII.<br>
