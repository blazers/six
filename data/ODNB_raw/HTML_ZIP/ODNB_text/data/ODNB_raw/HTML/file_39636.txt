<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Blood]</span>,  Gertrude Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [Lady Colin Campbell]</span>  (1857&#150;1911), <span class="occ">art critic and journalist</span>, was the second daughter and third of the four children of Edmond Maghlin Blood (1815&#150;1891) of Brickhill, co. Clare, and his wife, Mary Anne (1814/15&#150;1899), daughter of Thomas Fergusson of Leixlip, co. Kildare. She spent most of her childhood in Italy, which provided the setting for her popular children's book, <span class="italic">Topo</span>, published in 1878 under the name G. E. Brunefille, with illustrations by Kate Greenaway; her first published work was a travel article in <span class="italic">Cassell's Family Magazine</span>, &#145;My real Turkish bath: a lady's experience in Egypt&#146; (1, 1874&#150;5, 82&#150;3).<br>
<br>While visiting friends in Scotland in September 1880, she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60716/', "Lord Colin Campbell (1853&#150;1895)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4500/', "Campbell, George Douglas, eighth duke of Argyll")</script>], the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4500/', "George Douglas Campbell, eighth duke of Argyll")</script>. Two days later he proposed marriage and was accepted. The marriage was delayed by the disapproval of his family and by his ill health, but took place on 21 July 1881 at the Chapel Royal in London. The marriage rapidly failed, and in August 1883 Lady Colin sued for a judicial separation on grounds of cruelty, which was granted the following March. Two years later, the Campbells engaged in one of the most sensational divorce cases of the century: Lady Colin offered her husband's infidelity and cruelty (she alleged that he knowingly infected her with syphilis) as grounds; Lord Colin's counter-petition alleged that Lady Colin had committed adultery with at least four named men: Lord Blandford, Eyre Massey Shaw (the head of the London Fire Brigade), Tom Bird (a surgeon), and (General) Sir William Butler. The jury decided that no adultery had been committed on either side and no divorce was obtained; but Lady Colin's reputation had been destroyed: one newspaper described her as having &#145;the unbridled lust of a Messalina and the indelicate readiness of a common harlot&#146;  (Fleming, 1&#150;2). Even Lady Colin's apparently virtuous activities in helping in an East End soup kitchen, performing at charity concerts, and teaching factory girls in evening classes had been made to bear an unsavoury interpretation.<br>
<br>It is difficult to resist the temptation to view Lady Colin's entire career through the prism of this divorce case, the perspective of the only modern account of her life. And yet she was much more than a sexually compromised and socially disgraced woman. Indeed, the extent to which she lived beyond the prescribed roles of woman and wife was used against her in the trial, but it is for these transgressions, not sexual ones, that she should be remembered.<br>
<br>Lady Colin's precocious literary talents were to be turned to good account all her life. In October 1883 she submitted her first article to the editor of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, and thereafter became one of their staff writers, producing up to three articles a week on a wide range on topics, from science and literature to political economy; she frequently reviewed books written in Italian, French, German, and Spanish. In 1886 she published a series of her <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> essays as <span class="italic">A Book of the Running Brook and of Still Waters</span>, in part natural history and in part tract promoting the development of commercial inland fisheries to provide &#145;an immense increase in the supply of cheap and wholesome food for the nation&#146;  (p. 129). Her only novel, <span class="italic">Darrell Blake</span> (1889), which enjoyed considerable vogue (not merely because of the notoriety of its author), drew on her personal knowledge of journalism in its setting, while its plot&#151;the destruction of the happiness of the newspaper editor principally through his seduction by the scheming aristocrat Lady Alma Vereker&#151;demonstrated that Lady Colin (like Harriet Vane) would not be cowed by public notoriety into a show of &#145;proper feeling&#146;.<br>
<br>She wrote for a number of periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, especially on art, music, literature, and travel, and in 1889 became art editor of <span class="italic">The World</span>, the first woman editor on a London paper not exclusively aimed at a female readership. She retained this connection until 1903. As &#145;Q.E.D.&#146; she wrote a weekly column &#145;In the picture galleries&#146; for <span class="italic">The World</span>, and as Vera Tsaritsyn a series of travel articles, which were subsequently published as <span class="italic">A Woman's Walks: Studies in Colour Abroad and at Home</span> (1903). In 1894 she founded a weekly review, <span class="italic">The Realm</span>, but it folded in December 1895. She became the editor of the <span class="italic">Ladies' Field</span> in 1901, remaining with that paper for two years.<br>
<br>Much of Lady Colin's journalistic career was based on her connections with the Victorian art world, and it seems likely (in the absence of detailed research as yet) that it is here that her importance lies; it has been suggested that she &#145;perform[ed] for the visual arts what her colleague George Bernard Shaw was doing for music&#146;  (Fleming, 243). She exhibited her own works a number of times at the Society of Women Artists, and in November 1886, at the height of the divorce case, her small landscape, <span class="italic">Thalassa</span>, was exhibited at the Society of British Artists' show in Suffolk Street, an exhibition which also included her portrait by the society's president, J. M. Whistler, <span class="italic">Harmony in White and Ivory</span> (now lost). She also turned her hand to drama, writing a one-act play, <span class="italic">Bud and Blossom</span>, performed at Terry's Theatre in the West End, and co-writing with Clothilde Graves a full-length melodrama, <span class="italic">St Martin's Summer</span>, which was played in London by William and Madge Kendal. Her circle included Oscar Wilde, Arthur Sullivan, Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler, in whose studio she regularly worked), and Paolo Tosti, who was her singing teacher (Lady Colin had a rich contralto voice, and frequently appeared at charity concerts). Her place in such circles after the trial has yet to be established, but the range of her interests gave her an enviable measure of authority in her chosen fields.<br>
<br>In 1893 appeared <span class="italic">Etiquette and Good Society</span>, edited and revised by Lady Colin Campbell. The work was immensely successful, 92,000 copies having been issued by 1911. Such success was intensely ironic, as by the time of its appearance the author had been excluded from &#145;good society&#146; for thirteen years. Broadly conventional in the advice she offered, Lady Colin took the opportunity to pour scorn on the idea that labour was demeaning to a lady; she told an interviewer in 1902 that &#145;Work is the justification of living at all, the rent we are bound to pay to Nature for the actual space we occupy in the world&#146;  (Bertouche, 561). Lady Colin took her own injunctions to heart, until forced into retirement by the onset of rheumatoid arthritis in 1903. By 1906 she was wheelchair-bound and increasingly reclusive. She died at her home, 67 Carlisle Mansions, Carlisle Place, London, on 1 November 1911 from the effects of her disease, and was cremated at Golders Green. At her request, her portrait painted by Giovanni Boldini about 1897 was given to the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Lady Colin Campbell defined a lady as one who would &#145;never try, by any means, to appear other than she really is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Etiquette</span>, 1893, 18); the social ostracism engendered by her notoriety gave Lady Colin the freedom to be who she &#145;really was&#146;.<br>
