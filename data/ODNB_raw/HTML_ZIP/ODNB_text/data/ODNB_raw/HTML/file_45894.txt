<span class="headword">Crichton, Sir  Archibald William</span>  (1791&#150;1865), <span class="occ">physician in Russia</span>, the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_70845"></a><span class="headword">Patrick Crichton</span>  (1762&#150;1823)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Margaret Lambie, was born in Gayfield Square, Edinburgh, on 10 April 1791. His father, a well-known figure, distinguished himself with the army in America during the American War of Independence before returning to partner his father, Alexander Crichton (1721&#150;1808), in the family's coachbuilding firm. Elected an Edinburgh city councillor and treasurer, he also commanded the Royal Edinburgh volunteers' first regiment from 1794 to 1796, as featured in John Kay's <span class="italic">Original Portraits</span>, and an Edinburgh militia regiment, besides publicizing his inventions for conveying troops and sick or wounded personnel.<br>
<br>Archibald William Crichton was educated at Edinburgh high school and Edinburgh University where, in 1810, he contributed a paper on alkaline salts to the Royal Medical Society. He graduated MD with &#145;De melancholia&#146;, a thesis dedicated to his father and his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6693/', "Alexander Crichton (1763&#150;1856)")</script>, Tsar Alexander's physician and director-general of the Russian civil medical branch, whom he joined at St Petersburg soon afterwards. Through his uncle Crichton obtained in May 1811 the post of medical supervisor, responsible for developing a mineral spa resort in the Caucasus mountain area, and his success in controlling a plague outbreak earned him the knight cross of the order of St Vladimir (fourth class). Following Napoleon's abortive invasion of Russia, he volunteered for army service and in 1813 became physician to a hospital for French prisoners at Riga. Transferred at his own request to his uncle's headquarters by his compatriot James Wylie, the tsar's physician and inspector-general of the military medical department, Crichton took part, as a member of the tsar's suite, in two battles for the French capital. On Napoleon's withdrawal from Paris, the British hosted a dinner in April 1814 for their Russian allies. It was attended by Wylie, Crichton (now promoted to physician-in-chief of the Russian hospitals in the city), Count Platov, generals Chernikov and Barclay de Tolly, and many other senior officers. In 1814 Crichton was awarded the campaign medal and the knight cross of the order of St Anne (second class), as well as the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by Louis XVIII. After a short period as regimental surgeon to the renowned Preobrazhensky guards, in 1816 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to Grand Duke Nicholas, who became tsar in 1825.<br>
<br>In addition to his medical duties, Crichton often performed the role of a courtier. He escorted Grand Duke Nicholas on his four months' tour of Britain between 1816 and 1817. They stayed, <i>inter alia</i>, at Chatsworth House (6&#150;9 December 1816) as guests of the sixth duke of Devonshire, and reached Glasgow at Christmas. It was Crichton and not, as recorded, his uncle who accompanied the grand duke and interpreted when Robert Owen, the social reformer, invited them to spend a night at his New Lanark community home late that December. Owen declined Nicholas's offer to help resettle two million surplus British workers in Russia with a view to expanding the country's manufacturing industry  (Owen, 115&#150;20). In 1817 Crichton received honorary doctorates in medicine and law from Glasgow and Oxford universities respectively, and he was knighted by the prince regent in the same year. He corresponded from Russia in 1818 with the London ambassador Prince Lieven and the duke of Devonshire about the birth of the tsarevich Alexander, whom he safely vaccinated, and about the grand duchess's health. On 20 May 1820 he married, at St Petersburg, Sophia Louisa Kimmel (1798&#150;1869), a widow, daughter of Nicholas Suthoff (<i>d</i>. 1836), court physician and obstetrician. In 1825 Crichton treated Maria Federovna, the dowager empress.<br>
<br>Crichton, known as Vasily Petrovich Kreyton in Russia, played a significant part in monitoring the serious cholera epidemic in Russia during 1830&#150;31. His knowledge and medical advice on the subject were sought by colleagues such as Joseph von Hamel, the distinguished Russian academician and scientific writer, and Nicholas Arendt, one of the most important surgeons before Pirogov. Co-ordinating information sent from all over Russia, Crichton made a report on the epidemic to the Russian medical council towards the end of 1831, and this in turn formed the basis of two reports compiled by the Royal College of Physicians of London for the privy council. These and accounts by other British doctors of the Russian &#145;cholera morbus&#146; were relayed to the central board of health in London. Crichton's letter to Sir Alexander Crichton in England, describing the treatment of cholera by German doctors at six St Petersburg hospitals, was published in 1832. He was decorated with the order of St Stanislas (first class) on the birth of Grand Duke Michael in 1832, and was accorded a special badge for &#145;20 years' impeccable service&#146; two years later.<br>
<br>Compelled by ill health to relinquish his post of physician to Tsar Nicholas and his wife Charlotte, Crichton retired in 1837 with the rank of councillor of state, equivalent to a major-general, and, presumably, with a pension. He was presented with a snuffbox on the tsar's twenty-fifth wedding anniversary in 1847, and was an elected honorary member of the Physico-Medical Society of Moscow University from 1838 to 1848. A portrait represents Crichton as a pleasant man of shrewd intelligence, wearing several insignia on a smart green coat and around his neck. In addition to the honours mentioned he was awarded the higher Russian orders of St Vladimir (second class) in 1834 and St Anne (first class) in 1837, and, successively in 1829, in 1834, and about 1837, two classes and a star of the grand cross of the order of the Red Eagle of Prussia. According to the <span class="italic">Scottish Antiquary</span>, which published excerpts from his father's family history, he intended to &#145;make out his title to the Frendraught peerage&#146;  (pp. 12&#150;16), but evidently he decided against pursuing this claim to an Aberdeenshire viscountcy conferred upon James Crichton in 1642. Four of his six children died young, but his son Nicholas (1825&#150;1885) became a councillor of state and married Helena Johanna Augusta Nieroth, a wealthy countess of German origin. Their son Nicholas (1869&#150;1916) served as gentleman of the bedchamber to the imperial court in 1911. Crichton died at St Petersburg on 27 February 1865, and was buried at the Smolensk evangelical cemetery on 2 March.<br>
