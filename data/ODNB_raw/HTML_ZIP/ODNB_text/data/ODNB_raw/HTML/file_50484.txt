<span class="headword">Verral <span class="st"> [Verrall]</span>,  William</span>  (1715&#150;1761), <span class="occ">innkeeper and writer on cookery</span>, was born on 10 April 1715, in Lewes, Sussex, the fifth of the eight sons (and one daughter) of Richard Verrall (<i>d</i>. 1737), master of the White Hart inn in Lewes from about 1724, and his wife, Sarah Mores (<i>d</i>. 1758). The family depended on the patronage of Thomas Pelham-Holles, first duke of Newcastle: William's father ran the inn, which had been converted from a Pelham family mansion; his eldest brother, Richard, managed a coffee house catering for the duke's political supporters; and after Richard's death in 1742 another brother, Henry, took over. Family members frequently petitioned the duke for places in the local surveyorship of windows, the customs, or the Post Office. After his father's death William was chosen to succeed him as master of the White Hart in 1738, after a period working in the ducal kitchens (probably at Newcastle House in London) under Newcastle's famous French cook, Pierre Clouet or Clou&eacute;. Despite Verral's assertion in his book concerning his several years' experience under Clouet, Newcastle's accounts suggest that he worked as an under-cook to the duke for only about two and a half years  (BL, Add. MSS 33321, fol. 27; 33322, fol. 24). By August 1738 he was running the inn, for in that month he supplied suppers for two balls in Lewes for which Newcastle paid; similar payments were recorded in 1742, 1743, and 1744.<br>
<br>In the 1740s Verral seems to have prospered: in 1740 he applied to Newcastle for the position of Lewes postmaster and, although the place was already promised elsewhere, he did obtain the carriage of letters between Eastbourne and Lewes. In 1742 he contributed 3 guineas to the subscription for the building of a new hospital in the town, and in January 1745 his name headed the petition addressed to Sir Francis Poole by a number of Lewes tradesmen to protest against the prolonged quartering of a company of soldiers in the town. As a respected member of the community, Verral was a headborough for Lewes 1748&#150;9, high constable in 1753&#150;4, and served as an official again in 1756. But at some point in the late 1750s his prosperity declined, perhaps after the death of his first wife, Ann Botting, in 1757. They had married on 29 January 1745, and a daughter, Elizabeth, had been born in the same year. Verral may have turned to authorship in the hope of making money. His cookery book, <span class="italic">A Complete System of Cookery</span>, which appeared in 1759, was the result of his experience under Clouet, and the recipes offer an illuminating glimpse of French &#145;nouvelle cuisine&#146;, with its light, simple dishes, as it was practised in England in the 1730s and 1740s. Excellent though the recipes are, Verral's highly personal preface, with its satirical anecdotes of the rustic Sussex gentry, can have done nothing to endear the book to its potential readers, and the first edition was also the last.<br>
<br>Verral's fortunes went from bad to worse: early in 1761 he appealed to Newcastle for help, and the duke recommended him to the justices of the peace of Middlesex as keeper of the house of correction. But, by February 1761, his furniture had been put up for auction, and in March he was declared bankrupt and was thus ineligible for the post. On 2 March he married Hannah Turner (<i>d</i>. 1765); he died later that month in Lewes, and was buried there on 26 March 1761 at St Michael's Church. Today Verral is remembered for his cookery book, one of the very few to give a true picture of French cookery in England in the middle of the eighteenth century. Verral's recipes are clear and well explained, with comments on the relative merits of French and English cookery, and on the success of particular dishes. Such a balanced discussion of the two cuisines is extremely rare among the mass of xenophobic comment which characterizes English cookery books of the period.<br>
