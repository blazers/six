<span class="headword">Dudley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stokes]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1750&#150;1823), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born on 8 June or 8 August 1750 at Bristol, the daughter of Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1773) and Mary Stokes. It has been claimed that there were thirty children and that on one occasion half were in Temple Church, Bristol, to hear a brother preach. Mary had a strict Church of England upbringing, and also enjoyed &#145;most of the vain amusements of the world&#146;  (Dudley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2) but, becoming increasingly serious in her later teens, she attended Methodist meetings. By the time she was twenty-one, however, she started to go to Quaker meetings, causing John Wesley (who had much esteemed her) to write in strong terms of disapprobation&#151;to which she made a spirited reply. By 1773 she was a decided Friend and soon afterwards sometimes spoke in meeting for worship. Her mother's chance presence on one such occasion helped to reconcile the outraged relatives to her Quakerism. She later moved from Bristol to Frenchay and was married there on 9 July 1777 to Robert Dudley (1732?&#150;1807) of Prior Park, Clonmel, co. Tipperary. She was his third wife and had the care of five stepsons; the couple also had four sons, the eldest being <a href="#cosubject_73026">Charles Stokes Dudley [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and four daughters. By 1806 all her stepsons had died, the longest-lived being forty-two. Clonmel, her home until 1810, had a substantial and cultured Quaker population.<br>
<br>By the time of her marriage Dudley's vocation for the ministry was formally acknowledged, and in 1786 she first travelled in the ministry. In 1788, when her seventh child was but ten weeks old, she was away for six months as a member of a small group of Friends travelling in Holland, Germany, and France, visiting Moravians, Inspirants, and the groups near N&icirc;mes who came to form a Quaker meeting at Cong&eacute;nies. She was away from home for much of the rest of her life, visiting Quaker meetings throughout Britain and Ireland, and appointing special meetings to which townspeople or villagers would flock in large numbers.<br>
<br>Dudley's travels in the ministry in Ireland throughout the 1790s were considerable, as were those of more than half a dozen Irish, English, and American ministering Friends. Apart from the political events of the decade, it is almost as though they recognized the theological tensions which were also brewing and which would decimate Irish Quakerism between 1798 and 1801. The paths of these ministering Friends crossed and recrossed and&#151;as they stayed at Prior Park or were companions with Mary Dudley on journeys, or simply met her in out-of-the-way places&#151;their affection as well as their regard is in no doubt. Her vocal ministry was &#145;tender and winning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 328), her sympathies broad, and her pastoral gifts sensitive. Her significance in the history of Irish Quakerism during this decade may be greater than has hitherto been recognized.<br>
<br>Dudley suffered a persistent affliction of the lungs, which cannot have been helped by constant travelling in all weathers, by a succession of different houses or inns to sleep in, and by the strain of almost daily meetings. She often had to take to her bed when travelling in the ministry and in 1795, seriously ill, finally journeyed to her native Bristol to take the waters. Within six weeks her health had markedly improved. She returned to Ireland and was once again on the move. However, she was soon affected by ill health and in 1798 her life was in danger. Reluctantly, she accepted medical advice stipulating &#145;a sea voyage and short residence at Bristol Hotwells&#146;  (Dudley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 228). Her son Charles, who accompanied her and her four daughters, later claimed that they had left Ireland because of the rising. Robert Dudley may well have been grateful for the medical advice: that it was genuine seems equally certain.<br>
<br>The family returned to Ireland in 1800, and the succession of travels in the ministry resumed. In 1807 Dudley's husband and a son died, and in March 1810 a daughter. Later that year she and her three surviving daughters moved to London, settling in Southwark. Apart from a visit to Yorkshire, Dudley's ministerial labours were now confined to London and the home counties. In winter 1818&#150;19 (she had just returned from a 400 mile journey) she was confined to the house for a considerable time, &#145;her body and mind suffering under a combination of afflicting circumstances&#146;  (Dudley, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 301). One affliction was the bankruptcy of the business run by two of her sons, bringing serious loss to their creditors. She continued her Quaker activities until 18 April 1823 when palpitations of the heart and faintness confined her to bed. Despite a slight remission in July, when she was able to be taken for drives, she never regained strength and died on 24 September 1823, at her home in George Street, Peckham, Surrey. She was buried on 2 October at the Bunhill Fields Friends' burial-ground in London.<br>
<br>Dudley's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_73026"></a><span class="headword">Charles Stokes Dudley</span>  (1780&#150;1862), <span class="occ">administrator and writer</span>, was born on 18 September 1780 at Clonmel, co. Tipperary. He was educated at Ballitore School, co. Kildare, under Abraham Shackleton, and in 1798, aged seventeen, he was entrusted with the care of his four sisters and desperately ill mother, on their journey to Bristol. While there he found employment in a large commercial house and also met Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, and others to whom he was attracted by his literary tastes. When the rest of the family returned to Ireland in 1800 he went to London and then, or a little later, set up in business as a provision merchant. In 1802 he married Hester (1777&#150;1803), daughter of Joseph Savory (1745&#150;1821), a London goldsmith, and Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bellamy (1745?&#150;1785). His wife's death in 1803, along with that of their child, prompted Charles Lamb's poem &#145;When maidens such as Hester die&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1810 Charles Dudley joined his mother and sisters following their move to Southwark. His brother George (<i>b</i>. 1789) had already moved to London and entered his provision business. Charles, who now began to use his mother's maiden name as a second forename, became involved in the British and Foreign Bible Society's Southwark auxiliary. His organization was so successful that he was asked to visit other auxiliaries and demonstrate his system. From 1812 he gave a substantial part of his time to this work and from 1815 (partly also on account of ill health) was virtually a sleeping partner in the business.<br>
<br>In December 1818 Dudley was recalled from Bible Society business in Plymouth to find that his brother, who had assured him that the firm was lucrative, had suspended payment to creditors and that business was at a total stop, with debts amounting to &pound;20,000 against assets of &pound;7200. Both brothers were disowned by their respective monthly meetings. Charles Stokes Dudley had probably, in any event, been increasingly drawn to the Church of England, which he joined about 1820.<br>
<br>Hitherto, the work of the Bible Society from its foundation in 1804 had been entirely on a voluntary basis. Dudley now became salaried. Until 1852 he continued travelling the country, organizing and fostering auxiliaries. He published in 1821 a work entitled <span class="italic">An Analysis of the System of the Bible Society</span>, a 600 page volume of historical background, with guidance on the setting up and regulation of auxiliaries and branches. On 12 May 1824 he married Sarah Haycock, at Farnham, Surrey; the marriage produced thirteen children, eight of whom survived him. In 1852 he retired, having been the guiding hand behind the Bible Society's work for forty years. He died on 4 November 1862.<br>
