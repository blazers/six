<span class="headword">Wharton,  Michael Bernard</span>  (1913&#150;2006), <span class="occ">satirical journalist</span>, was born Michael Bernhard Nathan on 19 April 1913 at 7 Glenhurst Road, Shipley, Yorkshire, the youngest child in the family of two sons and a daughter of Paul Sigismund Nathan, a woollen stuff merchant from a family of German-Jewish origin, and his wife, Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wharton. As his father's wealth dwindled, his mother's conviction grew that her son should have been heir to Wharton Hall, Westmorland, with its deer park and long gallery, as he recounted in his memoir, <span class="italic">The Missing Will</span> (1984). This title referred both to a lost testament that might restore his inheritance and to a lack of drive. As a boy he would stare for hours from the window at Nab Wood, where he first experienced the numinous.<br>
<br>From Bradford grammar school Michael Nathan went in 1932 to Lincoln College, Oxford, on a county scholarship. He learnt to drink and, in &#145;an unremitting war on reality&#146;, joined a fellow Bradfordian in a game of their invention, West Riding Knife Throwing. This also entailed catching, and their hands were often bandaged  (<span class="italic">The Missing Will</span>, 45). Another friend said: &#145;He seemed to look at people as though they were animals at a fair&#146;  (ibid., 62). He took a third in classical moderations in 1934 but in the summer of 1936 was sent down for throwing a Scotch egg at high table in hall. He returned to Oxford one morning by permission to take his viva, very drunk. He did not gain a degree. On 17 July 1936, at Bournemouth register office, he married Joan Atkey, the 21-year-old daughter of William Atkey, estate agent. He described himself on the marriage certificate rather grandly as &#145;author&#146;. At that time he was finishing a novel, &#145;Sheldrake&#146;, featuring Tibetan thought-forms in a Yorkshire mill-town, an adumbration of his journalism. It found a publisher only in 1958.<br>
<br>His marriage was hidden from his parents until a son was born in February 1938, when he changed his surname to Wharton. He and his wife lived in a cottage in the Eden valley, Westmorland, a place he ever after loved, and campaigned to preserve. The rent was 10 shillings a month, and he regularly contributed to <span class="italic">Punch</span> under the name Simon Crabtree, at &pound;12 for 1000 words. He kept up contributions even while serving in the army during the Second World War. He rose to acting lieutenant-colonel as a staff officer in India. He was demobilized in 1946. Having left his wife and child he lived raffishly after the war, finding work with the BBC (where a report he saw said he was &#145;not really BBC material&#146;; <span class="italic">Missing Will</span>, 214). For more than a decade he spent a day a week selecting morning stories for the radio.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1957, having &#145;passed the night in a drunken phantasmagoria&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dubious Codicil</span>, 3), Wharton began his first permanent job, writing a column in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> that he continued for forty-nine years. At first he assisted Colin Welch, who had begun the column fifteen months earlier, but from 1960 he wrote its 1000 words four days a week single-handed, resisting assistants. Headed &#145;Way of the world&#146;, it was signed Peter Simple. Readers were ignorant of its author, and the vignettes drawn by Michael ffolkes included one of Peter Simple as a tall, moustachio'd figure in a deerstalker. Sir Colin Coote, the editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, was not encouraging. &#145;Not too many skits please, Wharton&#146;, he would say  (ibid., 12). His successor Maurice Green occasionally laughed at what he called Wharton's &#145;notes&#146;  (ibid., 167).<br>
<br>Peter Simple's humour was black pessimism tempered by fantasy, influenced not by Beachcomber of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> but by Myles na Gopaleen (Brian O'Nolan) of the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>. The columnar characters attracted Homeric epithets, such as Dr Spacely-Trellis, the go-ahead bishop of Bevindon, or Alderman Foodbotham, the 25 stone, crag-visaged, iron-watch-chained perpetual chairman of the Bradford city tramways and fine arts committee. A tutelary hero was Colonel Sibthorp (1783&#150;1855), the reactionary MP who repelled the mainline railway from Lincoln. Wharton sided with such hated groups as Afrikaaners in South Africa and Serbs in the former Yugoslavia.<br>
<br>Wharton was dogged by self-doubt, &#145;like an evil spirit, blighting life and hope&#146;, and haunted by a school report judging him &#145;passive and lacking in initiative&#146;. Fascinated by his part-Jewish identity, he was aware of a &#145;persistent dream of literary fame and corresponding inability to live&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dubious Codicil</span>, 72). In the 1960s attacks of unease and dread increased. In 1963, after being declared columnist of the year by Granada Television's <span class="italic">What the Papers Say</span>, his depression deepened. He spent ten days voluntarily in an asylum, and underwent electro-convulsive treatment, returning to work after five weeks.<br>
<br>Wharton labelled his private life &#145;a horror comic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dubious Codicil</span>, 137). His second wife, Catherine Mary (Kate) Derrington (1931&#150;1992; daughter of John George Frederick Derrington, electrical engineer), whom he had married on 19 December 1952, shared his taste for fantasy, and nocturnal drunken charades enacting the French Revolution or the battle of the Somme brought pyjama'd neighbours onto the pavement to dance with rage outside their windows. Despite ties of &#145;affection and intermittent lust&#146;, Wharton disliked Kate's growing dominance  (ibid., 254). She had become the lover of Colin Welch, who spent part of his time with his own wife. In 1964 Wharton met Susan Daughne Moller, a schoolteacher thirteen years his junior, and daughter of Nils Henry Moller, barrister. They were to marry on 4 January 1974, but not until 1971, when his daughter with Kate was at university, did Wharton leave the house in Putney where Kate was bringing up two children of Colin Welch. Between marriages, alone in Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, he invariably ate five fish-fingers for dinner, read into the small hours, and each day caught a combination of buses to Fleet Street, creating the column on the way. He often used the word &#145;masochism&#146; to characterize his chosen &#145;life of routine boredom&#146;  (ibid., 221).<br>
<br>In his early seventies Wharton seemed an inward man, peering through the upper lenses of his spectacles and making quiet remarks. He ended his column when the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> moved to the Isle of Dogs in 1987, but was persuaded to resume it for the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> by its editor, Charles Moore, then weekly for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> when Moore took up its editorship in 1995. Meanwhile <span class="italic">The Missing Will</span> (1984) took his life to 1957; its sequel, <span class="italic">A Dubious Codicil</span> (1991), painted astonishing comic scenes of drunken Fleet Street life, with a nightly theatre of the absurd in a pub called the Kings and Keys. Critics were struck by the vividness and honesty of these volumes. His last column appeared three days before his death, on 23 January 2006, of pneumonia in Wycombe Hospital. He was survived by his wife, Susan, and his two children.<br>
