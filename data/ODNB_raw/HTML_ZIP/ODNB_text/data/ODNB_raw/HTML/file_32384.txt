<span class="headword">Chavasse,  Christopher Maude</span>  (1884&#150;1962), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born at 36 New Inn Hall Street, Oxford, on 9 November 1884, the eldest (and identical twin) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32385/', "Francis James Chavasse (1846&#150;1928)")</script>, then rector of St Peter-le-Bailey, Oxford, and later bishop of Liverpool, and his wife, Edith (1851&#150;1927), daughter of Joseph Maude, vicar of Chirk, Denbighshire, and his wife, Mary. Christopher had an elder sister, twin younger sisters, and two younger brothers. Educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and Liverpool College, he went up to Trinity College, Oxford, in 1905, where he distinguished himself as an athlete, gaining blues for lacrosse and athletics. Both he and his twin brother represented England at the Olympic Games of 1908. In the same year he failed his history schools, whereupon he sat pass moderations and a group.<br>
<br>Chavasse was ordained to a curacy at St Helens, Lancashire, where his gifts of leadership and his initiative in tackling social problems were immediately apparent. He enlisted as a chaplain in the forces in 1914 and served throughout the First World War, being awarded the MC and the Croix de Guerre. In August 1917 his twin brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55355/', "Noel Godfrey Chavasse")</script>, who had won the VC, was killed in France. One of his younger brothers was also killed. He was promoted deputy assistant chaplain-general in the 11th corps in 1918. On demobilization in 1919 he was appointed vicar of St George's, Barrow in Furness. In the same year he married Beatrice Cropper (<i>d</i>. 1977), daughter of William Edward Willink JP of Dingle Bank, Liverpool. They had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Noel, gained the MC in the Second World War and the second son, Michael, became a QC and a circuit judge.<br>
<br>In 1922 Chavasse returned to Oxford as rector of St Aldates, where he built up a vigorous congregation of undergraduates and established a reputation as a gifted preacher and a leader among younger evangelicals. He became known outside Oxford as a tenacious and well-informed opponent of the proposals for the revision of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, at the risk, he was told by the archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, of any chance of preferment.<br>
<br>In 1928 it fell to Chavasse to initiate the fulfilment of the vision of his father, who had died that year, namely the founding in Oxford of a new and evangelical college which would attract men of modest means and provide bursaries for ordination candidates. He left St Aldates for St Peter-le-Bailey, a living which he had held in plurality for six months, and round St Peter-le-Bailey and the buildings associated with it he began the first stage of a hostel for non-collegiate students. A petition was presented to the convocation of the university for the licensing of St Peter's as a permanent private hall, with Chavasse as its first master. Permission was granted in 1929 but not without some opposition, partly from Anglo-Catholic opinion and partly provoked by the impetuousness and enthusiasm of the young master in his dealings with the university's delegacy of lodgings. Chavasse recruited a body of able tutors and the early years were marked by a steady growth in numbers and reputation. Behind the scenes there was a constant struggle to establish the hall on a sound financial footing; but from the impact that Chavasse made on the first generation of men in the hall, no one could have guessed the stress of financial worry. It was typical of him that he was able to enlist the support of W. R. Morris (later Viscount Nuffield) on the basis of a friendship formed through his pastoral ministry at the death of Morris's mother. With Morris's support and the personal sacrifice of Chavasse and some of his friends, the finances of the hall were secured. During this period his interests were not confined to Oxford. He served as proctor for the university in the convocation of Canterbury in 1936&#150;9, and continued as chaplain to the Territorial Army.<br>
<br>In July 1939 Chavasse was nominated to the see of Rochester, but his consecration had to be delayed until St Mark's day, 25 April 1940, owing to injuries sustained in a boating accident, as a result of which he lost the use of a leg, which was amputated in 1942. His episcopate of over twenty years fell into two periods. The first decade was devoted to the problems of wartime and post-war reconstruction. He had a deep understanding of the pastoral needs of men and women in the forces, and a concern for their homes and churches, so badly damaged by enemy action. The figure of the bishop with an artificial leg, worn with great fortitude, was an inspiration to many in what he used to call his &#145;bomb-alley&#146; diocese. In preparing for peace he launched, in 1944, a great appeal for &pound;1 million for rebuilding and augmentation. He was concerned for &#145;diocesan consciousness&#146; in an area where all roads lead towards London, and to achieve this he appointed a &#145;mobile force of diocesan officers&#146; and held regular clergy conferences. Early in his episcopate he was faced with a problem of discipline which attracted widespread attention. It concerned the reservation of the sacrament in the parish of St Mary's, Swanley. He insisted on loyalty to the policy laid down by both houses of convocation, which permitted reservation in the manner allowed in the 1928 prayer book. His action was misrepresented by some Anglo-Catholics, but he was later able to claim that his stand, which was upheld in the consistory court, had smoothed the path for his episcopal brethren. His most distinguished service to the church at this time was his chairmanship of the commission which produced the report <span class="italic">Towards the Conversion of England</span> (1945), which created much discussion in the post-war period and inspired evangelistic campaigning, but the bishop was disappointed in the subsequent attitude of the church assembly. He also produced many other books and pamphlets.<br>
<br>The second decade of Chavasse's episcopate was devoted to further advance. A church extension campaign was launched to provide churches in the new housing estates arising from the overspill of London's population. Chavasse had a great sense of occasion and in 1954 used the 1350th anniversary of the founding of the diocese as a focus of effort. His last years saw the creation of a third archdeaconry at Bromley (1954), the suffragan bishopric of Tonbridge, and a diocesan centre at Chislehurst. He also founded at Rochester a theological college for older men.<br>
<br>Chavasse was more than a diocesan figure. He had a rare combination of great moral and physical courage which led him to be outspoken on a number of issues such as on the element of gambling in premium bonds and on the Wolfenden report. As an evangelical churchman he had an independent position for, although he was their undoubted leader, he was distrustful of liberals on grounds of vague theology and he opposed extreme conservative fundamentalism.<br>
<br>In 1936 Chavasse was appointed OBE, in 1940 TD, in 1959 DL, and he was also DD (Lambeth). In 1960 he retired to Oxford, where he had become an honorary fellow of Trinity College (1955) and of St Peter's (1949). He lived to see the fulfilment of his earlier ambitions when St Peter's became fully incorporated as a college of the university in 1961. Chavasse died at Oxford on 10 March 1962.<br>
