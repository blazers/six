<span class="headword">Bowes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Aske]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1505, <em>d.</em> in or before 1572), <span class="occ">protestant exile</span>, was baptized in August 1505 at Aske in Richmondshire, North Riding of Yorkshire, the daughter of Roger Aske (<i>d</i>. before 1510), son of William and Felicia Aske, and Margery Wycliffe (<i>d</i>. before 1510). By 23 July 1521 she had married Richard Bowes (<i>c</i>.1497&#150;1558), youngest son of Sir Ralph Bowes of Streatlam, and had been granted the lands of her grandfather, father, and mother, and of a certain William Curtes, which she inherited with her sister Anne, wife of Ralph Bulmer. Elizabeth and Richard Bowes had five sons and ten daughters; their sons included the soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3050/', "Sir George Bowes (1527&#150;1580)")</script> and the ambassador <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3059/', "Robert Bowes (d. 1597)")</script>.<br>
<br>By 1546 Richard Bowes was commander of Norham Castle near Berwick on the Scottish border. Three years later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15781/', "John Knox")</script>, the Scottish reformer, assumed responsibilities at the parish church of Berwick, where Elizabeth Bowes made his acquaintance. Their friendship is documented in twenty-nine letters from Knox to Bowes preserved in a manuscript transcription of 1603 along with the dedicatory letter to Bowes that prefaces Knox's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Sixth Psalm</span> (U. Edinburgh L., MS La. III. 345; published in <span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 3.111&#150;56; 3.337&#150;402; 4.217&#150;18). Although Bowes's letters to Knox are not extant, their substance can be reconstructed from his replies. Throughout 1552&#150;3, when the majority were written, Bowes was troubled by doubts regarding her salvation. Her letters contained pointed questions on difficult passages in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, confession of specific temptations and sins, and expressions of anxiety over her status as one of the elect. In response, Knox provided biblical expositions, urged her to regard struggles with sin as a mark of salvation, not damnation, and assured her of the indelible tokens of election. Although Knox assumed the role of mentor, he acknowledged the mutual spiritual benefits of their relationship, noting that Bowes was &#145;a verie mirrour and glass whairin I beheld my self&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 3.338). Furthermore, her questions forced him to clarify his own understanding of various doctrines.<br>
<br>By 1553 Knox had contracted to marry Elizabeth Bowes's fifth daughter, Marjorie (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1534), but the accession of Mary Tudor altered his status from respected court preacher to renegade reformer. As a result Richard Bowes and his brother, Sir Robert Bowes, withdrew their permission for the marriage. Despite opposition from their family, Elizabeth Bowes and her daughter left England for Scotland in 1555; Marjorie and Knox were probably married near the end of that year. In July 1556, however, all three left for the continent, and on 13 September arrived in Geneva, where they remained until the accession of Elizabeth. The rift between Richard and Elizabeth apparently went unhealed: he died in 1558, but neither his wife nor Marjorie is mentioned in his will, and his remaining daughters are strictly forbidden to marry against their brothers' wishes upon pain of forfeiting their inheritance. In 1559 Elizabeth returned to England, while Marjorie joined her husband in Scotland, where they resided until her death in 1560. In 1562 Elizabeth Bowes received permission to travel to Scotland to care for her two grandsons and her son-in-law. When Knox married Margery Stewart in 1564 she returned to England.<br>
<br>The intensity and duration of Bowes's friendship with Knox provoked rumours of an illicit relationship, which Knox refuted in a letter appended to his last work, <span class="italic">An Answer to a Letter of a Jesuit Named Tyrie</span> (1572). There he notes that their &#145;great familiaritie and long acquentance &hellip; was [based upon] nether fleshe nor bloode, but a troubled conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 6.513). His further comment that despite the comfort of her friendship &#145;it was not without some croce: for &hellip; my mynde was seldome quyet, for doing somewhat for the comfort of her troubled conscience&#146;  (ibid., 6.514), has led some to dismiss Bowes as a spiritual hypochondriac, obsessively attached to her own sins. But her religious anxieties can better be understood within the context of the religious upheavals of the time, and the opposition of her family and community to her fervent protestantism. The assertion by Robert Surtees that Elizabeth Bowes died in Edinburgh in 1568 has been found incapable of substantiation; she certainly died some time before Knox's death in 1572.<br>
