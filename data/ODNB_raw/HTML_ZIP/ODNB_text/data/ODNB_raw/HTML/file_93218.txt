<span class="headword">Carr&eacute;,  Jean</span> <span class="st"> [John Carre]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1572), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and glass manufacturer</span>, was born in Arras, Artois, the son of Antoine Carr&eacute; and Dunigell Michell Prevost, probably before 1520. It is likely that he passed at least part of his early working life in the town since his daughter Mary was also born there, but while she and her husband Peter Appel arrived in London in 1561, Carr&eacute; at some point settled in Antwerp before following them later to England as a religious refugee. He may have been active in the confessional conflict in the Low Countries, but was not the Jean Carr&eacute; of Arras (son of Simeon) whose participation in the failed Calvinist putsch in Antwerp in March 1567 and attendance at protestant sermons led the &#145;council of troubles&#146; to banish him in 1568. By the summer of 1567 Carr&eacute; son of Antoine was living in London with his wife, Jane Campe, and daughters, Anne and Gilkin; they were recorded as attending the French church. The family initially lodged with Mary and Peter Appel.<br>
<br>Carr&eacute; is credited with the re-establishment of window glass production in England and for introducing the manufacture of <i>cristallo</i> tableware. In July 1567 he obtained a licence from Queen Elizabeth to build furnaces for the production of window glass in the Weald. Fearing competition he petitioned Sir William Cecil, the secretary of state, for a monopoly for the manufacture of window glass and Venetian crystal. On 8 September 1567 letters patent were issued to Carr&eacute; and one Anthony Becku for the exclusive production of window glass in either the Norman or Lorraine manner for twenty-one years, on condition that Englishmen were trained in this skill.<br>
<br>Carr&eacute; leased land at Fernfold Wood near Alford on the Surrey&#150;Sussex border, where he built two glass furnaces and brought glassworkers from the continent to operate them. During 1568 he entered into agreements with glassmakers from Lorraine (Thomas and Balthasar de Hennezell) and Normandy (Pierre and Jean de Bongard) for the production of window glass at these two furnaces. A third furnace at Crutched Friars in London was run by Carr&eacute; himself and manned by Flemish workers, specializing in the production of <i>cristallo</i> tableware glass. By October 1568 Carr&eacute;'s furnaces were using three different continental traditions for glass production. In spite of his share of the window glass monopoly, Becku was marginalized and in July 1569 he appealed to the privy council. This led to an investigation into Carr&eacute;'s operations, which concluded that while there was little hope of Englishmen being trained in window glass manufacture, production should continue regardless of the terms of the letters patent.<br>
<br>Carr&eacute; continued to specialize in manufacturing crystal glass in London but production only expanded with the employment of Italian glassmakers. By June 1571 Carr&eacute;'s household in Broad Street included six men described as &#145;all his servants, all glassmakers and all Italians&#146;. He subsequently leased the glass furnace to the Italians and moved to Fernfold Wood in Sussex to begin production of drinking vessels in green forest glass. The new furnace had not been completed by May 1572 when Carr&eacute; died at Fernfold. In his will, dated 11 May, he requested that the enterprise be continued by his widow, brother-in-law (Peter Campe), and sons-in-law (Peter Appel and Hans ten Rude), while his four-year-old son John Baptist was to be educated in &#145;the art of making small glass&#146;. Carr&eacute; was buried at Alford parish church on 23 May 1572.<br>
