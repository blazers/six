<span class="headword">Peter,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ralph Ferrars]</span>  (1788&#150;1853), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born at Harlyn, St Merryn, Cornwall, on 22 March 1788, the eldest son of Henry Peter (<i>d</i>. 1821), an army officer, and his wife, Anna Maria, youngest daughter of Thomas Rous of Piercefield, Monmouthshire. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 January 1803, and graduated BA on 19 March 1807 and MA on 7 December 1809. On 12 January 1811, he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1836), only daughter and heir of John Thomas of Chiverton in Perranzabuloe, Cornwall; they had ten children.<br>
<br>After living for a few years in London, where he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 28 May 1813, Peter returned to his native county and settled on his property, which had been greatly increased by his marriage. He became a JP and deputy lieutenant for Cornwall, and was prominent among the country gentlemen who campaigned for electoral reform. When the close boroughs in Cornwall were abolished by the first <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, he was invited to stand for the enlarged constituency of Bodmin, and was elected on 11 December 1832. He sat until the dissolution of parliament on 29 December 1834; but the enthusiasm for reform had then died away, and he did not stand again. His political interests are reflected in <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Present Crisis</span> (1815), a memoir of Sir Samuel Romilly in an edition of his speeches (1820), and <span class="italic">A Letter from an ex-M.P. to his Late Constituents</span> (1835).<br>
<br>Peter shortly retired to the continent to read, and to enjoy the company of, and to translate, German authors. His translations included Schiller's <span class="italic">William Tell</span> (1839), and <span class="italic">Mary Stuart</span> (1841). His own poetry includes <span class="italic">Sacred Songs</span>, paraphrases of selected psalms (1828), <span class="italic">Poems by Ralph Ferrars</span> (that is William Peter, new edn 1833), and some specimens in Griswold's <span class="italic">Poets and Poetry</span> (1875 edn, 240&#150;43).<br>
<br>In 1840 Peter was appointed British consul in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. His first wife had died on 21 August 1836 and in 1844 in Philadelphia he married his second wife, Sarah King (1800&#150;1877), daughter of Thomas Worthington of Ohio and widow of Edward King, son of Rufus King of New York. She was described as &#145;one of the most distinguished women in American society&#146;, the founder of a school of design for women at Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Peter's compilation <span class="italic">Specimens of the Poets and Poetry of Greece and Rome</span>, by various translators (1847), was well received. He died in Philadelphia on 6 February 1853 and was buried in the churchyard of St Peter there, where a monument to his memory was erected by a number of the leading citizens.<br>
<br>Peter's eldest son, John Thomas Henry Peter, fellow of Merton College, Oxford, died in July 1873. The third son, Robert Godolphin Peter, formerly fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, became rector of Cavendish, Suffolk.<br>
