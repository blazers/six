<span class="headword">Hunt,  Norman Crowther</span>, Baron Crowther-Hunt  (1920&#150;1987), <span class="occ">constitutional scholar and television and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 13 March 1920 at Bradford, Yorkshire, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Ernest Angus Hunt, master butcher, of Eccleshill, Bradford, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crowther. He was educated at Belle Vue high school, Bradford, and at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he was an exhibitioner (1939&#150;40) and, after war service in the Royal Artillery and the War Office, a scholar (1945&#150;7). He married Joyce, daughter of the Revd Joseph Stackhouse, of Walsall Wood, Staffordshire, in 1944; they had three daughters. Hunt took a first in both parts of the history tripos (1946 and 1947), was a research fellow of Sidney Sussex (1949&#150;51), and then spent a year as Commonwealth Fund fellow at Princeton, studying American politics. In 1952 he was elected to a tutorial fellowship in politics at Exeter College, Oxford, where he spent the rest of his academic career.<br>
<br>Hunt was the very antithesis of the cloistered don, however. A square, stocky, round-faced man of enormous energy and indefatigable good humour, he took delight in challenging closed establishments, devising schemes and drafting papers for reform of matters great and small, and proving his stamina in new fields. He had won a Cambridge football blue as goalkeeper (1940), and continued to be an agile opponent in most ball games and in politics at every level. His years as domestic bursar of Exeter (1954&#150;70) were christened the Norman Conquest by those who felt their impact. He was not a man for the long-considered haul of quiet research. He published part of his historical Cambridge PhD thesis (1951) as <span class="italic">Two Early Political Associations</span> (1961), edited <span class="italic">Whitehall and Beyond</span> (1964), and (with Graham Tayar) <span class="italic">Personality and Power</span> (1971), and wrote (with Peter Kellner) <span class="italic">The Civil Servants</span> (1980). But his academic gifts lay in teaching, not scholarship.<br>
<br>Hunt was an invigorating, forceful tutor for generations of Oxford undergraduates, and, thanks to the BBC, a challenging political guide and familiar voice to a much wider audience. From 1961 he appeared regularly on both television and radio, and his <span class="italic">People and Politics</span> was a weekly feature of the World Service for many years. His long service to the BBC culminated in his appointment as chairman of its General Advisory Council in 1986. It had also initiated a lasting friendship with Harold Wilson, a fellow Yorkshireman, whom Hunt interviewed (and greatly impressed) shortly after Wilson's election as leader of the Labour Party in 1963. While Wilson was prime minister (1964&#150;70, 1974&#150;6) Hunt was able to promote the two constitutional issues about which he felt most deeply, and which he helped to place firmly on the political agenda: reform of the civil service and devolution.<br>
<br>Hunt's was the chief radical voice in the committee on the civil service (1966&#150;8) chaired by Lord Fulton. He led its management consultancy group and drafted much of the final report which condemned the &#145;generalist&#146; (and Oxbridge) bias of civil service recruitment and sought to open senior posts to specialists. In 1969 he was appointed to the royal commission on the constitution, chaired first by Lord Crowther and then by C. J. D. Shaw (later Lord Kilbrandon). Hunt was once again on the radical wing, though this time in a minority. He was principal author of a long memorandum of dissent to the final report (1973), in which he argued that devolution to the English regions must go hand in hand with the devolution to elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales which Kilbrandon recommended.<br>
<br>In 1973 Hunt was made a life peer (he took the title Baron Crowther-Hunt of Eccleshill), and on Wilson's return to power in 1974 he was appointed constitutional adviser to the government (March&#150;October), with a brief to develop its devolution proposals. He dealt with the same issue as minister in the privy council office in 1976. In the interim, from 1974 to 1976, he was minister of state at the Department of Education and Science; but he was less successful at handling the public controversies aroused by his proposals for manpower planning in higher education than he had been as a backroom advocate and elaborator of policy. He was disillusioned also by the extent to which narrowly party-political considerations determined the government's attitude to devolution, and although civil service reform had proceeded further, he chafed at what he saw as continuing Whitehall obstruction. He returned to full-time teaching at Exeter College in 1976, not disappointed (he was the last man ever to have regrets), but with some relief.<br>
<br>Hunt's election as rector of the college in 1982 began the final, and personally most satisfying, part of his career. He enjoyed the distinction, as he enjoyed his honorary fellowship of Sidney Sussex (1982) and his honorary degrees from Bradford University (1974) and Williams College, Massachusetts, USA (1985). But he was as determined as ever to use his position to reshape institutions and open their doors to fresh talent. He helped to reform the university's admissions procedures, and initiated an ambitious and successful college appeal. He made the rector's lodgings a welcoming centre of college activity, where undergraduates met public figures, where he could share his interests in music, and where his closeness to his family, and dependence upon them, were visible. Still full of plans for the college, and with seven months to go before retiring from office, he died suddenly of a heart attack in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 16 February 1987 and was buried at Wolvercote cemetery in Oxford.<br>
