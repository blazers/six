<span class="headword">Dent,  Edward John</span>  (1790&#150;1853), <span class="occ">chronometer maker</span>, was born on 19 August 1790 in Portugal Street, Westminster, the elder of two sons of John Dent (<i>b</i>. 1767), an officer of the East India Company, and his first wife, Elizabeth, formerly Chapman (<i>d</i>. 1793), of Bedford. The younger son, William (1792&#150;1858), became a printer's clerk, working in London and Bedford before returning to Islington where he died.<br>
<br>Edward Dent was apprenticed in 1804 to his grandfather John Wright Dent, a tallow chandler. Lodgings were to be provided for him under this agreement and he lived with his cousin Richard Rippon (1767&#150;1835), watchmaker, of 46 King Street, Westminster. Dent became fascinated by the craft of watchmaking and in 1807 persuaded his grandfather to turn him over for the remainder of his apprenticeship to Edward Gaudin, watchmaker in Clerkenwell. At the end of his term Dent returned to live in Rippon's house, by then 43 King Street. He was employed by several of the leading watchmakers, acquiring from Barraud &amp; Son a good knowledge of chronometers. He began making these for himself and in 1829 his no. 114 won the Royal Observatory's premium award.<br>
<br>In September 1830 Dent entered into partnership with John Roger Arnold, then one of the foremost chronometer makers. Arnold had a small factory at Chigwell, Essex, but he and his foreman were elderly and Dent offered both new ideas and proven business ability. Dent was made free of the Clockmakers' Company in 1831 and he moved into Arnold's house at 84 Strand. At this time one cause of error in timekeepers arose from extremes of temperature acting on the metals composing the balance springs. The properties of these various metals, and how magnetism affected them, were poorly understood. Arnold and Dent, probably with Richard Rippon's son, Frederick William Rippon (1808&#150;1860), experimented with glass balance springs, though these did not live up to their early promise. Dent also experimented with mercury-filled clock pendulums (another temperature-compensating device) and lectured on this subject to the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Newcastle in 1838. By that time Dent's own reputation was assured. He was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1833, and in 1838 Arnold and Dent received the royal warrant.<br>
<br>During 1837&#150;9 Dent, urged on by the astronomer royal, George Biddell Airy, began estimating the longitudes of certain observatories by sending groups of chronometers, set to Greenwich time, to compare with local time there. Such journeys, by sea and in the rough land transport of the period, challenged the best chronometers, but their successful outcome was a valuable advertisement. Dent sent chronometers to Paris&#151;their journey vividly described in the <span class="italic">Nautical Magazine</span> of 1838 and subsequently as a publicity booklet; to Scotland (Sir Thomas Brisbane's observatory at Makerstoun, and Edinburgh); to Dublin and Armagh; to Oxford, Bedford (Admiral Smyth's observatory), and Cambridge; to Portsmouth and Hamburg; and to New York. It is not clear how many of these expeditions Dent accompanied. He had agents in many ports and was a frequent visitor to the continent.<br>
<br>Relations with Arnold deteriorated from 1838 and the partnership ended in 1840. Dent went to live at The Mall, Kensington, but he also bought 82 Strand, where he installed a roof-top observatory, a temperature-controlled chronometer testing room, and fully equipped workshop. Frederick Rippon accompanied him, and he traded from 1 October 1840 as E. J. Dent, London, obtaining the royal warrant in 1841. Fortunately Airy and Captain Beaufort, the hydrographer, continued to pass Dent a share of the jobs formerly sent to Arnold and Dent, and after Arnold's death in 1843 he secured the entire business.<br>
<br>Dent continued to experiment with balance springs and filed his most important patent in 1842, though it was worded loosely enough for him to continue to develop his ideas in subsequent months. As with Dent's other patents, a similar patent was applied for in Paris. In 1843 Dent was asked to send chronometers to ascertain the difference in longitude between the observatories of Altona, near Hamburg, and Pulkovo, in Ukraine. In view of their satisfactory performance, the Russian emperor awarded him a gold medal and the title of chronometer maker to his imperial majesty. He also provided regulator clocks for observatories at Pulkovo, Geneva, Turin, and Venice.<br>
<br>At the late age of fifty-two Dent married, on 1 July 1843, Elizabeth Rippon, formerly Davis (1789&#150;1865), the widow of his cousin Richard Rippon. Her two sons Frederick and Richard Edward Rippon (1817&#150;1856) were also watchmakers, Frederick being employed by Dent. Both subsequently took the name of Dent. Elizabeth also had two daughters, Mary Elizabeth (1813&#150;1892), married to Thomas Buckney, and Amelia Lydia Sophia (1814&#150;1881), married to Henry Gardner. At about the time of his marriage Dent became involved in the manufacture of the dipleidoscope and two other instruments, the aneroid barometer and the marine compass, whose mechanisms bore similarities to those of watchwork. The dipleidoscope, the idea of his watchmaker friend P. M. Bloxham and patented in 1843, was based on the principle of double reflection. It consisted basically of a prism, though larger models had a small telescope and compass, and it enabled the meridian passage of the sun to be timed with great accuracy. Thus it could be used to set a watch, or if the time were known, to calculate the longitude.<br>
<br>The aneroid barometer was invented in France by Lucien Vidie, but was dismissed by French scientists as unworkable. Vidie went to London, where an example was constructed and tested, and patented in 1844. Vidie called on Dent as a possible maker, but found Dent unwell and in pessimistic mood. He did, however, allow Vidie to hang three aneroids in his shop window where they were seen and bought by a naval officer who tested them and returned to order thirty more. From this first sale, the aneroid gained in popularity, helped by its small size, portability, and cheapness (Dent sold 6 in. diameter aneroids for 3 guineas). It is unclear whether those bearing Dent's name had mechanisms made in Vidie's workshop in Paris or were built entirely in London.<br>
<br>Dent's improvements to the marine compass, patented in 1844 and 1850, consisted in suspending the card on a vertical needle carried at both ends in jewelled bearings, and in weighting the card in such a way as to prevent it from ceaselessly oscillating with the ship's motion.<br>
<br>Dent had recently begun to take an interest in turret clocks when in 1843 tenders were invited for a chiming clock for the newly built Royal Exchange. He submitted the lowest tender and it was accepted in August that year. Dent went to examine turret clocks in France and Belgium, acquired a factory at Somerset Wharf, off the Strand, and purchased the necessary machine tools. Airy contributed ideas for the clock's design but Dent had to put these into practice and he was particularly exercised over the choice of metal for the wheels and the method of cutting the teeth. These difficulties were overcome, however, and Airy declared the clockwork satisfactory on 31 August 1844. Dent already had another shop at 33 Cockspur Street for the Westminster trade, run by his stepson Richard; now he rented 34 Royal Exchange, one of the tiny shops fronting the Exchange building.<br>
<br>When the Palace of Westminster was to be rebuilt, following its destruction by fire in 1834, Dent applied to tender for the clock to be installed in the tower (now known as Big Ben). He was strongly supported by Airy but had to compete against Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy and John Whitehurst of Derby. Relations between these three rapidly soured, and in 1847 Dent withdrew his tender and departed to St Petersburg. After much deliberation between Airy, the architect Charles Barry, and various other officials and representatives of government, Dent agreed to retender and on 25 February 1852 his estimate was accepted. However, he died, at The Mall, Kensington, on 8 March 1853, and so Frederick Dent, who had inherited this part of the business, continued with the clock's construction. This was not to the liking of some of the officials concerned and legal advice was sought; Airy resigned from the committee overseeing the progress of the clock after conflicting with Edward Beckett Denison (later Baron Grimthorpe), a barrister known for his competence in horology, but eventually by 1859 the clock was installed and running.<br>
<br>Edward John Dent had divided his business interests between Richard, who inherited the Cockspur Street premises but died, intestate, of a brain disease in 1856, and Frederick. Before he died on 25 April 1860, Frederick destroyed the will and codicils that Denison had drawn up for him, triggering a lengthy legal dispute which was won by his widow. Elizabeth Dent continued to trade, assisted by her sons-in-law, as E. Dent &amp; Co. After her death the firm was controlled by members of the Buckney and Gardner families, descended from Frederick's two sisters, and employed other members of the extended Dent family. In 1968 the last Buckney emigrated, turning the business over to the managing director. In 1975 it became a subsidiary of Toye &amp; Co. Ltd.<br>
