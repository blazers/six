<span class="headword">Whately,  Mary Louisa</span>  (1824&#150;1889), <span class="occ">educationist and missionary</span>, was born on 31 August 1824 at Halesworth in Suffolk, where her father was rector. She was the third child and second daughter of the five children of the scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29176/', "Dr Richard Whately (1787&#150;1863)")</script>, later archbishop of Dublin, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1860), a charity worker who wrote on religious matters, the daughter of J. C. Pope of Hillingdon Hall, Uxbridge. When Richard Whately became principal of St Alban's Hall in 1825 the family moved to Oxford. In 1831 he was appointed to the see of Dublin: the family lived in Dublin in winter and in the summer at Redesdale, 5 miles from the city. The children were educated at home by their parents; they helped their mother to visit the Irish poor in their homes and taught in the village school built by their father.<br>
<br>In 1849, while accompanying her brother to France and Italy for his health, Mary Whately painted and learned Italian. On her return to Ireland she put much energy into the ragged schools (for children whose parents could not afford fees) and homes of the Irish Church Mission; she also visited poor Italians in Dublin. Through this work she gained first-hand experience of teaching people of different languages and cultures. In 1856&#150;7 Mary Whately travelled to Cairo and the Holy Land with a friend; unfortunately her journals of this visit were lost. However, a fellow traveller described how, faced by Bedouin with flashing weapons, she began to sketch the scene. &#145;By the life of the Prophet!&#146; exclaimed the chief. &#145;The Englishwoman is writing us down!&#146; and, with a friendly greeting, wheeled and galloped off  (Porter, 229&#150;33).<br>
<br>In 1860, when her mother and her youngest sister had died, Mary Whately returned to Cairo to open the first school in Egypt for poor Muslim girls. She soon had thirty pupils and began to train teachers. She learned Arabic and was joined in her work by a Lebanese missionary to Muslims, Mansoor Shakoor, and his brother, Yousif; they, and later Mansoor's wife, worked with her for over twenty years. After visiting Ireland briefly in 1863 when her father died, Mary returned to Egypt to settle. She and the Shakoors opened a boys' Sunday school and later a ragged school for boys. She recorded her experiences in a lively and anecdotal style in <span class="italic">Ragged Life in Egypt</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">More about Ragged Life in Egypt</span> (1863). From time to time she returned to Europe, and in 1866 took with her Mansoor Shakoor and his betrothed wife (whom Mary raised as her adopted daughter and educated).<br>
<br>Mary Whately's work was funded by her own small income and donations. The schools became a regular visit on the itinerary of British travellers in Cairo, and in 1869 she was given a grant of land by the khedive. There, following Shakoor's plans, she built her house, a school, and mission buildings. The number of children in the two schools rose to some 500. The boys followed a full curriculum, covering basic academic and vocational subjects, while the girls (of whom there were about 100 in 1872) learned to read and write in Arabic, to sew, and embroider. A few girls progressed to a full elementary curriculum.<br>
<br>Mary Whately also took her Christian mission to the houses of the Egyptian poor, to the Bedouin camps in the desert, and to the villages along the Nile, working first with Shakoor and, when he died in 1872, with his widow. They told the stories from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and distributed Arabic scriptures. In some villages they were coldly received, but more frequently they were welcomed. Whately wrote of her close relationship with these people in <span class="italic">Among the Huts in Egypt</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">Stories of Peasant Life on the Nile</span> (1888). In 1879, with the help of a Syrian doctor who married into the Shakoor family, she opened a medical mission, which was soon caring for some 3000 patients a year. At the dispensary she explained the <span class="roman">Bible</span> stories &#145;in her simple and graphic way in the colloquial Arabic the people understood&#146;  (E. J. Whately, 78). The ragged schools flourished and her elder sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59106/', "Elizabeth Jane Whately (1822&#150;1893)")</script>, joined her and opened a private school for the &#145;mixed multitude&#146; of foreign residents in Cairo.<br>
<br>In 1881 the &#145;Arabi rebellion&#146; forced Mary Whately to withdraw from Egypt for a time, but she soon returned. On her visits to Europe she &#145;eloquently pleaded for Egypt and Islam at meetings and on every occasion that offered&#146;  (E. J. Whately, 82). She wrote and illustrated a number of books about everyday life in Egypt, as well as old family stories written in Spain and Switzerland, a memoir of Shakoor, and interesting fictional works &#145;illustrative of Egyptian manners and customs&#146;.<br>
<br>An intrepid and far-sighted woman, Mary Whately was strongly opposed to slavery and deplored the status of women in Egypt, hoping that one day they would &#145;come and go as one created to be neither a toy nor a drudge, but a helpmeet to man&#146;  (E. J. Whately, 126). Her writing promoted understanding of modern Egypt among her readers.<br>
<br>Mary Whately died in Cairo of a chest infection on 9 March 1889, shortly after one of her mission journeys up the Nile, cared for to the end by Mrs Shakoor. She was buried in Cairo on 9 or 10 March. Her schools did not survive her for long, but the Church Missionary Society, which had supported her work with several annual grants, had heeded her prompting to start a second Egypt mission to evangelize Muslims and had worked in the country from 1882.<br>
