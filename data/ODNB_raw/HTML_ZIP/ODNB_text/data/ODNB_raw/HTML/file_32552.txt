<span class="headword">Cooper,  James Davis</span>  (1823&#150;1904), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born on 18 November 1823 at Pratt's Place, Lambeth, London, the second son of George Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1843). His father was a church organist in London at St Sepulchre's, Snow Hill, and an assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral. James was a pupil at the City of London School in 1837 and then, at the age of fourteen, left to train as a wood-engraver in the studio of Josiah Whymper in Canterbury Road, Lambeth. As an apprentice he showed considerable talent and quickly became skilled as a wood-engraver, eventually becoming one of the leading engravers of the sixties, a period when book and periodical illustration flourished. Cooper made engravings of the work of many of the prominent artists of the time, including Miles Birket Foster, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Arthur Hughes, and provided illustrations for books by such notable figures as Darwin, Huxley, Livingstone, and Stanley. He also had the distinction of engraving illustrations for books by Queen Victoria, among them <span class="italic">Our Life in the Highlands</span> (1868). On 20 July 1848 he married Jane Eleanor, the daughter of Benjamin Ovington, a clerk in the Bank of England. They had three sons and four daughters. From 1848 Cooper lived at 10 Ely Place, Holborn, and by the following year he had established his own wood-engraving business. He later moved to Camberwell, and by 1855 he was working at 26 Great James Street, Bedford Row. Finally, by 1860 he had established a workshop at 188 Strand, where he worked until retirement.<br>
<br>Among Cooper's early works were engravings for an edition of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1847) after drawings by Charles Keene (who was also trained by Whymper) and thought to be Keene's first published illustrations. Cooper often pursued his own ideas for books, finding a publisher and commissioning artists; in this way he was able to encourage and forward the careers of a number of talented illustrators, such as Robert Barnes, E. M. Wimperis, and William Small. During the 1850s and 1860s he provided wood-engravings for books produced in association with the printer Richard Clay, including a number of fine engravings for <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span> (1858), after drawings by Birket Foster. His reputation was such that H. G. Bohn included him in his supplement to W. A. Chatto and J. Jackson's <span class="italic">Treatise on Wood-Engraving</span> (2nd edn, 1861) and featured examples of his engraving from <span class="italic">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span> (1859), after drawings by Percival Skelton, and <span class="italic">Select Poems and Songs of Robert Burns</span> (1858), after drawings by Birket Foster and Harrison Weir. Cooper produced engravings for many other notable books, among them <span class="italic">Favourite English Poems</span> (1859), Mrs Barbauld's <span class="italic">Hymns in Prose</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Pictures of English Life</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span> (1865), after drawings by T. Morten. In particular he is known for his collaboration with Randolph Caldecott, who had his first success in book illustration with an edition of Washington Irving's <span class="italic">Old Christmas</span> (1876) followed by <span class="italic">Bracebridge Hall</span> (1877), both projects initiated by Cooper and published by Macmillan. Much of the success of these books was due to the excellent craftsmanship Cooper showed in his faithful interpretation of Caldecott's drawing and his skill in achieving the integration of text and image in the design of the page. In 1883 the two men collaborated on an edition of <span class="italic">Aesop's Fables</span>.<br>
<br>In 1857 Cooper took out a patent (no. 710) for his invention of an engraving technique which, through a reversal of the usual process, produced a relief printing surface by cutting out the areas to print black and then making an electrotype, filling in the recessed areas. This produced raised lines which, when ground, formed an even printing surface. However this &#145;improvement&#146; never came into general use.<br>
<br>Cooper was also in demand as an engraver for magazines and periodicals, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> and magazines such as the <span class="italic">British Workman</span>, <span class="italic">The Quiver</span>, <span class="italic">London Society</span>, <span class="italic">Friendly Visitor</span>, and <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, in which he showed his ability for engraving architectural subjects. His work appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> from about 1863 and the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> in the 1880s. A most prestigious commission was for engravings of cloud effects from drawings by Ruskin which appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1884. Cooper is especially named in the text for having executed them to Mr Ruskin's satisfaction.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Cooper complained of being &#145;half-blind&#146;, as he suffered from cataracts, which forced him into retirement some years before his death, at the age of eighty. By all accounts he was a kind and genial man, &#145;jovial and breezy in manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), with a lively intelligence to his last days. He died at Rothesay, his final home, in North Road, Highgate, Middlesex, on 27 February 1904, and was buried in March in the Great Northern London cemetery.<br>
