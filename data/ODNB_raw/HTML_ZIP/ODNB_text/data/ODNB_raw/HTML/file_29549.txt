<span class="headword">Wiliems <span class="st"> [Williams]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1545/6?, <em>d.</em> in or before 1623?), <span class="occ">Welsh lexicographer</span>, was the son of Wiliam ap Tomos ap Gronwy, and Catherine, the illegitimate daughter of Meredydd ab Ifan, founder of the Wynn family of Gwydir and great-grandfather of its historian, Sir John Wynn. Born in Ardda'r Mynaich in Arllechwedd, probably in 1545 or 1546, and possibly on 20 April, Wiliems probably went to the school kept by the Wynn family primarily for its sons and also attended by William Morgan, the future translator of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but instead of proceeding to Cambridge as the latter did, he went to the University of Oxford, although there are no clear records of his stay there owing to confusion with others of the same name. He must have left Oxford without a degree to take holy orders, hence the &#145;Sir&#146; usually prefixed to his name (the title traditionally accorded to clergymen in Wales). He served for a while as curate in Trefriw, not far from his home. There he remained for the rest of his life, although he later became a recusant and thereafter practised as a physician, a calling that at that time required no special training and at best only book- or manuscript-learning, of which he had much, having started transcribing manuscripts when he was twenty-one years old, if not earlier. Wiliems was fortunate to be born into a generation of gentry better educated owing to the influence of the Renaissance than ever before and for some time afterwards, a generation well represented as such by the <i>generosi</i> of the Vale of Clwyd and its vicinity, who seem to have had in their possession some of the most important extant Welsh manuscripts. This meant for Wiliems easier, although not easy, access to manuscripts, to read and/or transcribe which he was prepared to make every effort.<br>
<br>Naturally Wiliems could not disregard medical manuscripts such as Llanstephan MS 10 and BL, Add. MS 14913 (with its text of <span class="italic">Meddygon Myddfai</span>), both of which passed through his hands, and it is not surprising to learn from Bishop Humphrey Humphreys that there existed in his time &#145;a pretty large Herbal in Latin, Welsh and English&#146; written by Wiliems; parts of this may survive in Thomas Evans's hand in Cardiff MS 2.973.<br>
<br>Like some of his fellow recusants denied access to the press, Wiliems took part in transcribing their works to secure their preservation and circulation. Father Vincenzo Bruno SJ's <span class="italic">Trattato del sacramento della penitenza</span> was apparently translated by him into Welsh. A section of the second part of Gruffydd Robert's grammar was copied by him in Peniarth MS 62. Wiliems was free from the prejudice which led some protestant Renaissance scholars to disregard the documents relating to the history of the medieval church.<br>
<br>But Wiliems's interest in Welsh manuscripts was wider even than that of the poets, their traditional conservationists, for it was the catholic interest of one who must have been planning at an early age to write a dictionary of the Welsh language. There is evidence enough to prove that he examined, transcribed, and/or used all kinds of manuscripts comprising genealogical texts (witness &#145;Prif Ach&aelig; Holh Gymr&ucirc; Benbaladr&#146;, NL Wales, MSS 16962 and 16963), historical texts (transcripts of &#145;Brut y Brenhinedd&#146; and &#145;Historia Dared&#146;, NL Wales, MS 5281), legal texts (a transcript of a Latin text of the Welsh Laws, Peniarth MS 225, and signs of having read Peniarth MS 29 and Peniarth MS 30), linguistic, including grammatical, lexicographic, and other pertinent texts (transcripts of &#145;Pum Llyfr Cerddwriaeth&#146; in Peniarth MS 62, of two bardic grammars in Mostyn MS 110, and his copious summary of Welsh proverbs in Mostyn MS 204, although not in his hand), and selections from the corpus of late medieval professional poetry (Peniarth MS 77, Havod MS 26). Peniarth MS 188 is described by J. Gwenogvryn Evans as Wiliems's &#145;Common place book or dictionary-in-the-making&#146;, &#145;the whole having no apparent system or arrangement&#146;. Although Wiliems does not mention Thomas Thomas's Latin&#150;English dictionary (first edn, 1587), he found in it the system he could follow: all he had to do was to substitute Welsh equivalents for Thomas's English. It took him several years (4 May 1604&#150;2 October 1607, although the date on the title-page is 1608) to write up his &#145;Thesaurus linguae Latinae et Cambrobritannic&aelig;&#146;, the three quarto volumes of Peniarth MS 228.<br>
<br>The strenuous efforts of his friend John Edwards, Plas Newydd, Chirk, extending even to the making of a more legible partial copy (Brogyntyn MSS 9 and 10) to ensure publication, proved to be unsuccessful and Wiliems turned to his kinsman, Sir John Wynn, in whose possession the manuscript was (from 13 August 1623) after Wiliems had died. Sir John Wynn did not survive Wiliems for many years, but he quickly appealed to John Davies, Mallwyd, for his help, promising financial support providing Davies would see the work through the press and on condition that full recognition be given to the author and the dedication be to Sir John. Davies was known to be engaged on a Welsh dictionary, and eventually published the <span class="italic">Dictionarium duplex</span> (1632) comprising a Welsh&#150;Latin part composed by himself and a Latin&#150;Welsh which is admittedly and obviously based on a very much abridged and revised version of Wiliems's &#145;Thesaurus&#146;. Perhaps Davies should not be too harshly criticized for taking advantage of the circumstances, and especially of the support of the Gwydir family, but one must regret that Wiliems has been denied the recognition and honour he so richly deserves as the author of the &#145;Thesaurus&#146; and as one of the greatest lexicographers of the Welsh language.<br>
