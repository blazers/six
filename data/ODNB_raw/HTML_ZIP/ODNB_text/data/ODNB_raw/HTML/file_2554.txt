<span class="headword">Blagdon,  Francis William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777, <em>d.</em> 1819), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was baptized on 19 January 1777 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, the son of Thomas and Mary Blagdon. He began his career as a horn-boy employed to sell the <span class="italic">Sun</span> newspaper whenever it contained any extraordinary news. He then became amanuensis to Dr A. F. M. Willich, a medical writer, who taught him French and German; he also learnt Spanish and Italian, and subsequently described himself as &#145;professor&#146; of those languages, which probably implies that he endeavoured to earn a living by teaching. At one time he published a <span class="italic">French Interpreter</span>. In 1802 Blagdon began editing the series <span class="roman">Modern Discoveries</span> (1802&#150;3); the first two volumes comprised Vivant Denon's <span class="italic">Travels in Egypt</span> in the train of Napoleon Bonaparte, the next two included Golberry's <span class="italic">Travels in Africa</span>, and the remaining four were devoted to Pallas's <span class="italic">Travels in the Southern Provinces of Russia</span>. The first two works were translated by Blagdon from the French, and the last from the German. His interests ranged from the literary to the historical. In 1803 he commenced publishing with the Revd F. Prevost a literary miscellany entitled <span class="italic">Flowers of Literature</span>, which continued to appear until 1809, and ran to seven volumes. In 1805 he brought out <span class="italic">A Brief History of Ancient and Modern India</span>, which was reissued in 1813 as an appendix to Captain Thomas Williamson's <span class="italic">European in India</span>, and in 1806 he contributed the &#145;Memoirs&#146; to Orme's <span class="italic">Graphic History of the Life, Exploits, and Death of &hellip; Nelson</span>.<br>
<br>About this time Blagdon became associated with the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, which he helped to edit for some years. The paper was then committed to upholding tory policies and Blagdon's literary activity took a polemical turn; he had already been imprisoned for six months in 1805 for libelling John Jervis, earl of St Vincent, in the matter of his naval administration. The proposal of the whig ministry of 1806 to remove Roman Catholic disabilities induced him to publish an edition of Foxe's book of martyrs, and this appeared as <span class="italic">An universal history of Christian martyrdom &hellip; originally composed by John Fox &hellip; and now entirely rewritten &hellip; by the Rev. J. Milner, M.A.</span> (1807). The pseudonym &#145;the Rev. J. Milner&#146; should not have been used, as a well-known Roman Catholic divine, John Milner, was then living.<br>
<br>In 1809 Blagdon came into conflict with political journalist William Cobbett (1762&#150;1835), and in October of that year he launched a Sunday paper, <span class="italic">Blagdon's Weekly Political Register</span>, in opposition to Cobbett's <span class="italic">Political Register</span>. Blagdon was ruined by speculation, however, and this paper, as well as the <span class="italic">Phoenix</span>, another of his ventures, soon came to an end. In 1814 Blagdon published <span class="italic">An historical memento &hellip; of the public rejoicings &hellip; in celebration of the peace of 1814, and of the centenary of the accession of the house of Brunswick</span>, and in 1819 a <span class="italic">New Dictionary of Classical Quotations</span>. Among his other noteworthy compositions were an edition of Dr Johnson's poems, together with his biography, contributed to <span class="italic">The Laurel</span> in 1808, and a general index compiled for the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, volumes 21&#150;43. Blagdon died in obscurity and poverty in June 1819, and a subscription was raised for his destitute widow and children.<br>
