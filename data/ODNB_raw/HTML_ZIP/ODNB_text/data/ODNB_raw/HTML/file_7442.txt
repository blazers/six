<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Delany <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Granville; <em>other married name </em>Pendarves]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1700&#150;1788), <span class="occ">court favourite and artist</span>, was born at Coulston, Wiltshire, on 14 May 1700. The elder daughter of Bernard Granville (1671&#150;1723) and his wife, Mary Westcomb (<i>d</i>. 1747), she was widely connected in court and political circles. Her father's elder brother was George Granville, Lord Lansdowne; his sister Ann, the wife of Sir John Stanley, who held a court appointment, had been maid of honour to Queen Mary.<br>
<br>The family moved to London shortly after Mary's birth. Educated at home and at an exclusive school run by a Huguenot refugee, she became fluent in French, well read in history and the classics in translation as well as English literature, a good musician, and a superb needlewoman. She showed early talent for drawing, cutting, and design. When she was eight she went to live with her aunt Stanley at Whitehall, presumably to be groomed for a place at court. However, the death of Queen Anne in 1714 and the subsequent whig supremacy reversed the family fortunes. Lord Lansdowne was held in the Tower for nearly two years. Bernard Granville was detained briefly; he then retired with his family to Benchland, near Camden, Gloucestershire. There Mary attracted the attention of a young man, Robert Twyford, who was as penniless as she. An invitation for her to join the Lansdowne household at Longleat in September 1717 was a welcome solution to this unsuitable courtship.<br>
<br>At Longleat Mary Granville met Alexander Pendarves (1660&#150;1725) of Roscrow, near Falmouth, Cornwall. The wealthy and childless 57-year-old MP welcomed a match that would possibly bring him an heir in addition to furthering his political alliance with Lansdowne. Since her family was entirely dependent on her uncle's generosity, Mary Granville had little choice but to accept Pendarves's proposal. They were married at Longleat on 17 February 1718. The marriage was unhappy for both partners. They first lived at Roscrow, where Mary was kept in nearly total seclusion, as he was jealous of any attention she received. Removed from her family and friends, she experienced the greatest despair of her life. The situation improved somewhat after 1721, when they returned to London, although Pendarves drank heavily and brought in his sister to keep an eye on his wife. Mary, however, was able to make visits to her family and to sample the delights of London society. Pendarves died unexpectedly on 8 March 1725. His widow was left with no resources beyond her jointure, but she was freed from his unpredictable presence.<br>
<br>For the next eighteen years Mary Pendarves lived in London. The first years of her widowhood were spent under the protection of the Stanleys, and from 1733 she occupied a house in Lower Brook Street. She was a participant at court functions, and attended the opera and theatre as well as private social events. Despite her lack of fortune her charm and vivacity brought her a number of suitors, including Lord Baltimore and Lord Clare, but she showed no inclination to marry again. Many of her most important friendships were cemented in this period, especially that with Margaret, duchess of Portland. The great collection of letters to these friends, and to her mother and sister, began during her widowhood; her autobiographical fragment, in the form of letters to the duchess, was written about 1740.<br>
<br>In 1731 Pendarves joined her friend Anne Donnellan, the daughter of Nehemiah Donnellan, chief baron of the Irish exchequer, in Ireland for a visit of eighteen months. They were widely entertained in Dublin and the country and introduced to most of Anglo-Irish society. Pendarves met Jonathan Swift, with whom she afterwards corresponded. More important was her meeting with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7443/', "Patrick Delany (1685/6&#150;1768)")</script>, an Irish Anglican cleric. The two were clearly attracted to each other, but he was already engaged to a rich widow, whom he married in 1732. In 1743, after his wife's death, Delany went to England to propose to Pendarves. Her male relations opposed the match, for Delany had neither fortune nor gentle birth. But she ignored these protests, and the marriage took place in London in early June 1743.<br>
<br>The Delanys lived principally at Delville, his house in Dublin. After his appointment as dean of Down in 1744 they spent some time there each year when in Ireland. Every two to three years they made an extended visit to family and friends in England. Mary Delany entered fully into her husband's life in Ireland, entertaining, decorating and embellishing his houses, and improving the gardens. She approached her important relations such as Lord Carteret for a higher place in the church for her husband, but with no success. They were frequently worried by a lawsuit over his first wife's property, which was finally settled in his favour. Patrick Delany died at Bath in May 1768.<br>
<br>Mary Delany returned to London, and lived first at Thatched House Court and then at St James's Place. She spent most summers at Bulstrode in Buckinghamshire, the favourite country house of the duchess of Portland. There the friends improved the gardens, collected shells and botanical specimens, indulged in various arts and crafts, and entertained poets, scientists, theologians, friends, and royalty. It was there in 1774 that Delany began what she called her paper mosaics, the cut-paper illustrations of flowers and plants that were her most important artistic achievement. Using various shadings of coloured tissue, she cut freehand all the parts of the plant, which were then pasted on black paper to make a perfect specimen. Nearly a thousand pages of her <span class="italic">Hortus siccus</span> were completed by 1784, when she had to give up the work because of failing eyesight; these are now in the department of prints and drawings at the British Museum.<br>
<br>Among the visitors to Bulstrode were George III and Queen Charlotte. Delany and the royal pair had many tastes in common, including botany and the music of Handel. After the duchess's death in 1785, the king gave Delany a house at Windsor and a pension of &pound;300. She enjoyed her last years as a royal favourite, and died at Windsor Castle, probably of pneumonia, on 15 April 1788. She was buried at St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>Although the flower collages were Delany's major work of art, she left other evidence of her talents. She designed and embroidered panels for clothing, chair covers, bed hangings and coverings, and other furnishings. She was a fine copyist of paintings, a maker of silhouettes, and a creative crafter of shellwork. Her most important legacy is the extensive correspondence that she carried on with members of her family and her friends. These letters contain information about every aspect of the life of the propertied class in England and Ireland from about 1725 to 1788. Cultural figures including Swift, Handel, and Rousseau make an appearance, as do prominent women writers such as Frances Burney, Elizabeth Montagu, Frances Boscawen, and Hannah More. The greatest number of the letters are to and from Delany's sister Ann Granville Dewes, her daughter Mary Dewes Port, and her daughter Mary Ann Port Waddington. The letters were edited and published in six volumes in 1861&#150;2 by Lady Llanover, Waddington's daughter. Although much personal detail is omitted in this edition, the letters are nevertheless a major source for contemporary information about such varied topics as medicine, servants, food, costume, reading, marriage, gardening, and collecting.<br>
