<span class="headword">Banister,  John</span>  (1624/5&#150;1679), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was the son of a wait in St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. He played (alongside Thomas Baltzar) in William Davenant's <span class="italic">Siege of Rhodes</span> (scheduled for September 1656 but possibly not performed for another three years). Pepys heard him perform at the Mitre tavern at the beginning of 1660. By the end of the year he had been appointed to one of the new places in the court musical establishment. He was then, according to Anthony Wood, sent to France &#145;to see and learn the way of the French composition&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D 19(4)). In April 1662 he was placed in charge of twelve violins (to be chosen by him from the band of twenty-four) who accompanied the king to Portsmouth to welcome the new queen, Catherine of Braganza.<br>
<br>In 1662 Banister was appointed to a place in the king's private music, filling a vacancy created by the death of Davis Mell in April. In July of the following year he was placed in charge of the select band of twelve violins, which was now to be constituted as a permanent ensemble. Not only was Banister given total artistic control, but he was also responsible for disbursing the &pound;600 per annum allocated to the group; this was eventually to become the source of a grievance among the other players.<br>
<br>For the moment, however, Banister's career continued to flourish. In November 1663 he was elected as an assistant in the Corporation for Regulating the Art and Science of Musick, and in June 1664 he was made one of the wardens for the following year. An order of 9 May 1665 from the lord chamberlain gave him joint responsibility with George Hudson and Matthew Locke for &#145;composing, ordering and directing of all his Majesty's violins (in the absence of the Master of his Mats Musick)&#146;.<br>
<br>But then things started going quite seriously wrong. Banister got into personal financial difficulties, and by 1665 was being importuned by creditors. This was a predicament shared by many of the king's musicians, since salary payments were well in arrears. In July 1665 Banister applied for the payment of the &pound;600 allowance due to the select band, complaining that he had<blockquote>spent much tyme in soliciting y<sup>e</sup> payment of the said Augmentacon to his own Damage by the hindrance of yo<sup>r</sup> Ma<sup>ts</sup> service and finds that w<sup>th</sup>out the constant payment of the same allowance yo<sup>r</sup> Ma<sup>ts</sup> Comands cannot effectually bee obayed &hellip;</blockquote>The following November the payment of some arrears was authorized in a warrant which noted that up to that date little more than a third of the money owing to the group had been paid over. A year later, on 7 November 1666, Banister and eleven other violinists (all but three of them members of his select group) signed another petition which emphasized the difficulties of their situation:<blockquote>That yo<sup>r</sup> pet<sup>rs</sup> &hellip; are in Arreare of their Sallaryes at the Trea[su]ry Chambers fower yeares and three quarters. And that severall of your Ma<sup>ies</sup> pet<sup>rs</sup> have had their houses and Goods burnt by the late Fire, which hath reduced them to great misery and want.</blockquote>But on 14 March the following year an order was issued for the &pound;600 allowance to be paid not to Banister, but to Louis Grabu (who had been sworn in as master of the musick four months earlier). By the end of the month Banister's colleagues in the select band had turned against him, submitting a lengthy &#145;Remonst[ran]ce against Mr Banister&#146; in which they accused him of embezzlement and even blackmail; he<blockquote>&hellip; demanded of the Company &pound;20 a peice &hellip; which if wee refused hee swore wee should be turn'd out of the Band. for saies he, I am to carry upp the names to morrow morning to the Councell Chamber, and they that will not doe this, their names shall be left out and others put in.</blockquote>All of this coincides with reports of Banister's rather hot-headed and arrogant behaviour. Anthony Wood had the idea that Banister had been displaced by Grabu as the director of the select band &#145;for some saucy words spoken to His Majesty (viz. when he called for the Italian violins, he made answer that he had better have the English)&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D 19(4)). And Pepys reported in his diary in February 1667 that &#145;they talk also how the King's viallin, Bannister, is mad that the King hath a Frenchman come to be chief of some part of the King's musique, at which the Duke of York made great mirth&#146;. Worse was to come. In May Banister was arrested for abusing Grabu and several other musicians. He had become, it seems, a somewhat disaffected member of the king's music. Banister was twice married. Following the death of his first wife, Mary, he married on 14 January 1671 Mary Wood (<i>b</i>. 1620/21), a widow; the marriage licence, issued on 11 January 1671, stated his age to be forty-six.<br>
<br>Throughout this period, Banister had been heavily involved with theatrical music, particularly for the King's Company, managed by Thomas Killigrew. The company's theatre in Bridges Street (completed in 1663) introduced to England the placement of musicians in front of the stage (the area now known as the pit). An order from the lord chamberlain dated 20 December 1664 required members of Banister's select band to &#145;attend at his Majesty's theatre whenever Thomas Killigrew shall desire them&#146;. Within a few months, the remaining members of the twenty-four violins were filling a similar role for the Duke's Company at its theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. This arrangement seems to have been doubly satisfactory to the court since it ensured both that the king and queen would be treated to excellent music when they visited the theatre and that these instrumentalists were getting some cash in hand at a time when their court salaries were hopelessly in arrears.<br>
<br>Banister's own involvement with the theatres was as composer as well as performer. In fact, he provided music for at least ten productions in the first decade of the Restoration period&#151;more than any other composer. The first seems to have been Sir Robert Stapylton's <span class="italic">The Slighted Maid</span> (performed by the Duke's Company in February 1662), whose text records that &#145;the Instrumental, Vocal, and Recitative Musick, was composed by Mr Banister&#146;. Banister's next theatrical compositions were songs to be sung between the acts of Katherine Phillips's <span class="italic">Pompey</span>, which was performed by Ogilby's Men in Dublin in 1663. The following year he wrote songs and instrumental music for <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span> by John Dryden and Robert Howard. After his displacement as the leader of the select band in 1667, Banister's compositional output increased and his loyalties shifted towards the Duke's Company: he provided music for its productions of Dryden's <span class="italic">Sir Martin Mar-All</span> (1667), Dryden's adaptation of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1667) (to which Pelham Humfrey also contributed), Davenant's <span class="italic">The Man's the Master</span> (March 1668), Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Royal Shepherdess</span> (1669), Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Forc'd Marriage</span> (1670), Samuel Tuke's <span class="italic">The Adventures of Five Hours</span> (a 1671 revival), John Crowne's <span class="italic">Juliana</span> (1671), William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Gentleman Dancing Master</span> (1672), Shadwell's <span class="italic">Epsom Wells</span> (1672), and Davenant's <span class="italic">Circe</span> (1677). He contributed music for just two productions by the King's Company: Charles Sedley's <span class="italic">The Mulberry Garden</span> (1668) and Dryden's <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span>, part 1 (1670).<br>
<br>Banister, needing to find a way out of his financial difficulties, became an innovator in other ways. Roger North gives a vivid account of his contribution to the development of the public concert in England:<blockquote>The next essay was of the elder Banister, who had a good theatricall vein and in composition had a lively style peculiar to himself. He procured a large room in Whitefryars, neer the Temple back gate, and made a large raised box for musitians, whose modesty required curtaines. The room was rounded with seats and small tables alehous fashion; 1s. was the price and call for what you pleased. There was very good musick, for Banister found means to procure the best hands in towne, and some voices to come and performe there, and there wanted no variety of humour, for Banister himself (inter alia) did wonders upon a flageolett to a thro base and the severall masters had their solos. This continued full one winter, and more I remember not. (Hereford Cathedral Library, MS R.II.xlii)</blockquote>Banister's concerts began at the end of 1672 in his house in Whitefriars (&#145;the Musick School&#146;). At the beginning of 1675 they moved to Chandos Street, Covent Garden, and from November 1678 until his death in 1679 they were held in the Essex Buildings, near St Clement's Church in the Strand. Despite North's assertion that the audience could call out requests, these concerts must, from time to time at least, have been quite elaborately structured. A booklet by Banister entitled <span class="italic">Musick, or, A Parley of Instruments</span> provides a dramatic framework for one of the 1676 concerts, which included such items as a &#145;Symphony of Theorboes, Lutes, Harps, Harpsicons, Guittars, Pipes, Flutes, Flagellets, Cornets, Sackbutts, Hoboys, Rechords, Organs, and all sort of Wind Instruments &hellip; with assistant Voices, and Violins&#146;.<br>
<br>Banister's financial troubles continued to the end. In 1679 he was still petitioning to be paid six years' worth of salary arrears. In May he was given six months' leave from his court duties, and in July he obtained a passport for himself and his son to travel abroad. The trip was never made, and he died on 3 October.<br>
