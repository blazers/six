<span class="headword">Palmer,  George Josiah</span>  (1828&#150;1892), <span class="occ">newspaper founder and editor</span>, was born in Clapham, Surrey, on 30 June 1828, the eldest son and second child in the family of four sons and a daughter of George Josiah Palmer, printer, of Savoy Street, Strand, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of John Hatchard, the evangelical publisher and bookseller, founder of Hatchards in Piccadilly. He was educated at Clapham grammar school and King's College School, London, and entered his father's printing firm as a compositor, later becoming manager. He married Marianne, daughter of James Beall, upholsterer, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 15 May 1851. They had six sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1852 Palmer purchased a small bookselling and printing business in Bloomsbury, London. Trade did not prosper, however, and in 1860 he was forced to sell out and take humbler premises at 32 Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, later to be the home of the <span class="italic">Church Times</span>. The turning point in his fortunes came in October 1861, when he was asked to take on the printing and publishing of <span class="italic">The Union</span> newspaper, which was trying to bring Tractarian Anglicans into touch with Roman Catholics. The connection soon snapped, however, as by mid-1862 internal squabbles among the paper's managers led to its demise. But Palmer's connection with <span class="italic">The Union</span> enabled him to build up a link with leaders of the advanced wing of the high-church party.<br>
<br>Palmer then decided to enter journalism on his own account and launch a popular church paper. On 7 February 1863 the first number of the <span class="italic">Church Times</span> appeared. Like <span class="italic">The Union</span> it was founded to forward the work and views of the Tractarians, who were then fighting an uphill battle against fierce opposition in the church. (Such practices as having candles on the altar were then considered popish.) The paper soon attracted readers, outshining all its Anglican rivals, and its sales rose steadily throughout Palmer's lifetime.<br>
<br>Palmer himself edited the <span class="italic">Church Times</span> from its foundation until his retirement in 1887, besides being responsible for its general direction and management. He was a realist, having little faith in committees. His experience of the committee-managed <span class="italic">Union</span> convinced him that personal guidance was the safest way to run any enterprise. Three of his sons also spent all or most of their working lives in the service of the <span class="italic">Church Times</span>. (The paper remained in the ownership and under the control of the Palmer family until its sale to Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd in 1989.) Palmer's paper was certainly outspoken: and, as his <span class="italic">Church Times</span> obituary remarked, &#145;our friend was no respecter of persons, however high in official standing, if he deemed it necessary, in support of God's truth or the Church's laws, to condemn their conduct&#146;. Like so many Victorians, he looked the part, his face possessing an authority worthy of a minor prophet. Palmer was also closely concerned with the work of the Church of England Working Men's Society and was for many years its honorary treasurer. He died at 3 Victoria Crescent, Ramsgate, on 27 January 1892.<br>
