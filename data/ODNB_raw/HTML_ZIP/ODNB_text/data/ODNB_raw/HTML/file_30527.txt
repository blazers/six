<span class="headword">Bailey,  Kenneth</span>  (1909&#150;1963), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 18 August 1909 at Alsagers Bank, near Stoke upon Trent, the fourth child and elder son of Bertram Bailey, colliery clerk, and his wife, (Elizabeth) Florence Buckley. He received his early education at the Orme Boys' School, Newcastle under Lyme, on leaving which he enrolled at the University of Birmingham, where he achieved a BSc degree with first-class honours in 1931, and took his PhD in 1933. The award of a Beit fellowship in 1933 took him to the Royal College of Science, Imperial College, London. There he came under the influence of William Thomas Astbury, who visited the laboratory periodically to discuss the analysis and denaturation of proteins. This led to a scientific collaboration and the development of a friendship between the two very different men.<br>
<br>Bailey's work soon showed a remarkable understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological facets of protein structure and in 1939 the Rockefeller Foundation awarded him a travelling grant to join E. J. Cohn and J. T. Edsall at Harvard. In December 1939, however, he returned home, to work first at Porton and then at the Low Temperature Research Station in Cambridge. Later he joined a team investigating organo-phosphorous compounds in the university biochemical laboratory at Cambridge. He obtained a Cambridge PhD in 1944. After the war he was granted an ICI fellowship, which released him to do research on the chemistry of muscle and the coagulation of blood: both projects brought him once again into contact with Astbury. In 1948 he became an assistant director of research in the university and was elected a fellow of Trinity College. In 1953 he obtained a Cambridge ScD, was elected FRS, and spent a few months as visiting professor at Washington University, Seattle, where he finished editing, with Hans Neurath, <span class="italic">The Proteins</span> (1954), the first work to treat the subject comprehensively. In 1961 he became a reader in biochemistry.<br>
<br>Bailey made no attempt to build up a research school of his own: he firmly believed that worthwhile discoveries were made only by those who &#145;played about&#146; at the bench. He never wanted more than one or two junior workers with him and refused offers of chairs at home and abroad. His researches were notable for their impact on the development of biological science. One was his clear demonstration in 1951 with F. R. Bettelheim, independently of the Leeds group under Lorand, of the nature of the action of thrombin on fibrinogen. This work led to the isolation of the fibrinopeptides and for the first time to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the fibrin clot.<br>
<br>Bailey's other great achievement was his discovery in 1946 of the protein tropomyosin, which, although originally isolated from skeletal muscle, was later shown to be present in most eucaryotic cells. He purified, crystallized, and characterized the protein in a way which could not be faulted even with the much more sophisticated methods of protein fractionation later available. Tropomyosin was the first fibrous protein to be crystallized and Bailey immediately recognized the uniqueness of the properties of this remarkable protein with 100 per cent &#945;-helical content. It was not until after his death, however, that the importance of tropomyosin for the function of all contractile systems depending on actomyosin was appreciated. In vertebrate skeletal muscle, in association with the troponin complex, tropomyosin is concerned with the regulation of the interaction of actin with myosin and hence contraction itself.<br>
<br>Bailey also made another less direct but nevertheless important contribution, through his research student, B. B. Marsh, to the understanding of the regulation of contraction in muscle. Marsh's investigation, under Bailey's direction, of the changes which occur in post-mortem minced muscle tissue, resulted in the discovery of the Marsh factor, the further study of which by other investigators subsequently led to the discovery of the calcium pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<br>
<br>Bailey was always somewhat reserved, and his gentle demeanour could often mask a deep intuitive understanding of people and affairs. He had, moreover, the rare gift of being able to express himself in lucid and, when needed, in vivid language. He was unmarried. His later years were marred by severe recurrent depressive illness and he committed suicide in Cambridge on 22 May 1963.<br>
