<span class="headword">Baly,  William</span>  (1814&#150;1861), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born and brought up in King's Lynn, Norfolk, the son of a bibliophile local businessman and his energetic intelligent wife. He attended King's Lynn grammar school and was apprenticed to a local general practitioner. In 1831 Baly began his medical studies at University College, London, and in 1832 he began pupillage at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1834 he passed the examinations of the Royal College of Surgeons and Apothecaries' Hall and he spent two years abroad studying at Paris, Heidelberg, and Berlin where he graduated MD in 1836. On return that same year he began general practice in London, first in Vigo Street, then in Devonshire Street, and finally in Brook Street. He was also for a short time medical officer to the St Pancras workhouse.<br>
<br>Between 1837 and 1842 Baly translated the work of the eminent German physiologist Johannes M&uuml;ller (<span class="italic">Elements of Physiology</span>, 2 vols.) and thus evidenced a considerable intellectual and academic ability which would be amply displayed later in life in his published work on morbidity and disease in prisons (&#145;On mortality in prisons&#146;, <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 27, 1845), the physiology of motion, cholera (report commissioned by the Royal College of Physicians, 1854), and on dysentery (<span class="italic">Goulstonian Lectures</span>, 1847). Indeed Baly had a minute knowledge of dysentery and was the first to observe that dysenteric sloughs in the large intestine may be associated with the true ulcers of enteric fever in the small intestine. In 1841 Baly became lecturer on forensic medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital and in 1846 was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and in 1847 a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1854 he became assistant physician at St Bartholomew's and in 1855 lecturer on medicine there.<br>
<br>On the recommendation of Dr Latham, who had been employed as a consultant at Millbank penitentiary at the time of severe epidemic scurvy, diarrhoea, and dysentery in the 1820s leading to many deaths and the temporary abandonment of the prison, Baly was appointed in 1840 to visit and report on the health of prisoners at Millbank. This institution had been opened on the banks of the Thames in London in 1816 as the showcase prison of Europe for convicts and it held up to 1000 prisoners of both sexes and, as indicated, had subsequently gained a reputation for putting the health of prisoners at risk. In 1841 Baly was appointed permanent medical superintendent there on the resignation of the post holder. At that time the prison served as a depot for holding transportees until removal to Australia, and later became part of the system of home-based penal servitude for convicts which replaced transportation after 1850.<br>
<br>The governor (and chaplain) at this time was the Revd Daniel Nihill who was dedicated to the spiritual and moral reform of prisoners. However, it was clear to Baly that dysentery was epidemic there in 1842 and he engaged closely with this problem through the next two years, which saw Nihill replaced by the choleric disciplinarian Captain Groves who remained governor throughout the rest of Baly's time there. Baly arranged for more meat to be included in the diet but he was anxious to devise a multi-dimensional analysis of the high levels of dysentery, diarrhoea, and fever. Thus he emphasized that disease was imported through transfer from other prisons, that prisoners were languishing longer than previously in Millbank itself, that dysentery was prevalent in London generally, that prisoners were poorly fed and suffered from cold, that lack of ventilation and foul air led to spread of disease in the prison and its neighbourhood, and that inmates were generally vulnerable to all disease as a result of mental depression engendered by long-term imprisonment. At this time Groves's irascible disposition resulted in a public inquiry into alleged abuse of staff and prisoners at which Baly gave evidence in Groves's defence.<br>
<br>In 1848 the cholera epidemic reached Millbank leading to high mortality for that year of 5.8 per cent among prisoners rising to 9.3 per cent in 1849 of which half was due to cholera. Baly suggested, again on the theory of miasmic contagion, that the proximity to nearby foul-smelling manufactories and sewers and damp, foetid atmosphere from the very polluted River Thames were the main causes. However, he also began to wonder whether the custom in the prison, and of other nearby institutions having a high incidence of cholera, of drawing drinking water from the Thames was also implicated. Although he was not sure of this he pressed for an artesian well to supply the prison and in 1854 this was dug near Trafalgar Square and a direct supply piped to the prison. Cholera all but disappeared from the institution. Baly, none the less, believed contaminated water to be no more than a subsidiary, &#145;exciting&#146; cause of the disease. In mid-July 1859 he retired to take the post of physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria. He acted also as censor of the College of Physicians (1858&#150;9) and sat as a crown representative on the General Medical Council.<br>
<br>On the evening of 28 January 1861 the 5.10 p.m. train from Waterloo to Portsmouth careered off the track on a bridge 20 yards from Epsom Junction onto the road below. William Baly was the only passenger to be killed although several others were severely injured. He was buried seven days later at Kensal Green cemetery near his home in Queen Anne Street, London. Baly never married and was survived by two sisters. He was a dedicated and humane pioneer of prison medical care who, moreover, contributed significantly to scientific medical knowledge and was greatly respected by the medical profession as a whole. The College of Physicians instituted a gold medal awarded biennially in his name, for distinction in physiology.<br>
