<span class="headword">Mostyn family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1540&#150;1642), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, were one of the leading gentry families in north Wales. The Mostyn estate was the result of a series of marriages in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which brought together what the Welsh poet&#150;genealogists of the sixteenth century described as the Five Courts: Pengwern near Llangollen in Denbighshire, Mostyn in Flintshire, Gloddaith in Caernarvonshire, and Trecastell and Tregarnedd in Anglesey. The first member of the family to inherit them all (in 1540) was Thomas ap Richard ap Hywel or Thomas Mostyn (1490&#150;1558). He and his younger brother, Piers, the ancestor of the Mostyn family of Talacre, were the first to adopt the surname which was the name of his main residence&#151;a change that can be seen in deeds between 1541 and 1547. In 1517 Thomas Mostyn married Jane (1502/3&#150;1572), daughter of Sir William Griffith of Penrhyn, Caernarvonshire. This was a major dynastic alliance between the leading family in north-east Wales and its counterpart in the north-west; the pre-nuptial settlement stipulated that should either party die before the consummation of the marriage another sibling would be provided. The couple had nineteen children, twelve sons and seven daughters. Mostyn also had at least one illegitimate daughter, to whom he left &pound;20 for a marriage portion. He died on 30 August 1558; in his will he left money for prayers for his soul and he was buried at Whitford in Flintshire.<br>
<br>The estate passed to Thomas Mostyn's eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_76885"></a><span class="headword">William Mostyn</span>  (1521&#150;1576)<span class="occ"></span>, who had already begun to play a part in local affairs. He had some experience of military service under William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, in suppressing the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger early in 1554 and he was the first member of the family to sit in parliament, representing Flintshire in 1553, 1554, and 1572. Mostyn married Margaret, daughter of Robert ap Hywel of Whittington, Shropshire, by 1542. The couple had three sons and two daughters. Service under Pembroke suggests that the Mostyns moved with the religious changes of the times; unlike their Talacre kinsmen, they certainly conformed after the accession of Elizabeth I and there seem to have been no recusants among them. From 1569 William Mostyn was a JP for Flintshire, being named of the quorum four years later, and sheriff of Flintshire three times and Caernarvonshire once. He began extending the house at Mostyn but died before the work was complete; his heir left it unfinished. His second marriage, to Margaret Goodman (<i>b</i>. in or after 1539, <i>d</i>. 1594), daughter of Sir William Brereton of Cheshire and his wife, Jane, and widow of a wealthy Cheshire merchant, was part of a double transaction, common among the gentry of north Wales, his new wife's daughter marrying his heir. Mostyn died on 19 September 1576. If his father's will reflected the old faith, his was uncompromisingly protestant. At his death the Mostyn rent roll was just under &pound;300, putting the estate among the most substantial in north Wales at that time.<br>
<br>William Mostyn's eldest son from his first marriage, <a name="cosubject_76886"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Mostyn</span>  (<em>c.</em>1542&#150;1618)<span class="occ"></span>, was an altogether more significant figure. He represented Flintshire in parliament from 1577 to 1583 and held the usual local offices, being sheriff of Anglesey twice, Flintshire twice, and Caernarvonshire once, JP in the same three counties (he was <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Caernarvonshire from 1596), deputy lieutenant of Flintshire and muster-master from about 1576, and, from 1602, a member of the queen's council in the marches of Wales. He was the first member of the family to be knighted, the accolade being bestowed when Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, was entertained at Mostyn on his way to Ireland in April 1599. In the subsidy of 1592 he was assessed at &pound;10; only one Flintshire squire was assessed at a higher figure. According to the family history, it was Sir Thomas Mostyn who began to assemble the famous Mostyn library. Like his father, he married twice. After the death of his first wife, Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1578), daughter of William Goodman, with whom he had three sons and two daughters, he married his kinswoman Katherine, daughter of Piers Mostyn of Talacre and his wife, Ellen, and widow of Sir Rhys Griffith of Penrhyn. Katherine Mostyn was the mother of the privateer and spendthrift <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11605/', "Piers Griffith (1568&#150;1628)")</script>, who, at the same time, married Sir Thomas Mostyn's daughter Margaret. Neither marriage was a success; the activities of Griffith may well have contributed to the failure of them both. Although Sir Thomas Mostyn's allegiance to the Elizabethan settlement seems never to have been in doubt, he was described by a contemporary as &#145;a man not very rigid against Catholics but one that complied with the times&#146;, which made it all the more embarrassing when, about 1582, he came face to face with a seminary priest near his house at Gloddaith and was obliged to arrest him. He died at Mostyn on 21 February 1618 and was buried at Whitford.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas Mostyn was succeeded by his elder surviving son from his first marriage, <a name="cosubject_47960"></a><span class="headword">Sir Roger Mostyn</span>  (1567/8&#150;1642)<span class="occ"></span>. Roger Mostyn's relations with his father were particularly bad. There is no explanation of the estrangement but it may have been connected with the son's marriage in 1596 to Mary (1581&#150;1653), daughter of John Wynn of Gwydir, with whom Sir Thomas Mostyn was at odds. Even before Roger Mostyn inherited the estate, he was buying land; he added to the estate itself, and his will shows his determination to provide for his younger sons. His activity in the land market during his father's lifetime may have been financed by the exploitation of the Mostyn coal measures, which he seems to have put on a proper commercial footing; he was certainly independent of his father for many years before he inherited the estate. Mostyn never seems to have been short of ready cash and in 1619, soon after he succeeded, his lands, including the coalmines, were valued at &pound;3275, his annual income being estimated at &pound;1678. He represented Flintshire in parliament from 1621 to 1622, but this was the only occasion on which he did so. There was a convention that the county seat went around the four leading families there in turn, and London seems, in any case, to have had little attraction for Mostyn, although his surviving letters show him to have been well informed about public affairs. When a new parliament was in the offing in 1624 he stated that he did not wish his eldest son, Thomas Mostyn (<i>d</i>. 1642), to stand for Flintshire. In the first place it was the turn of another family to represent the county and in the second place he did not wish to see the young man living apart from his wife in the capital, where he might be drawn into bad company. Like his father, Mostyn was sheriff of Flintshire and a JP in that county and in Caernarvonshire, as well as being a deputy lieutenant; in 1617 he was appointed to James I's council in the marches of Wales.<br>
<br>Although Mostyn had no patron in high places, he was on friendly terms with the leading figure from north Wales, John Williams, bishop of Lincoln and keeper of the great seal. His second son, John Mostyn, was in Williams's service. Roger Mostyn was the first of the family to attend university, matriculating at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 8 May 1584 and entering Lincoln's Inn in 1588. He was on friendly terms with his father-in-law; more is known about him than about any of his predecessors because of the voluminous Gwydir correspondence, which reveals that Wynn had a great respect for his judgement. His connection with the Gwydir interest predated his marriage and may possibly have helped to bring it about. From 1593 Mostyn was one of the trustees under the will of Sir John Wynn's uncle, Robert Wynn, the builder of Plas Mawr in Conwy, Caernarvonshire, being the cousin of Robert Wynn's second wife. This trusteeship was to lead to considerable ill feeling and litigation after Robert Wynn's death in 1598, with Mostyn's integrity being called in question. Sir John Wynn may have been instrumental in securing Mostyn's knighthood on 23 May 1606; he also obtained the manor of Mostyn, previously leased by the family, for him. Sir Roger Mostyn died on 18 August 1642 and was buried at Whitford. His eldest son predeceased him some months earlier and the estate was therefore inherited by his grandson Roger Mostyn. He left four other surviving sons, all of whom, together with two daughters, were provided for in his will.<br>
<br>The fact that the Mostyn estate was spread over four counties meant that the family, despite its wealth, never exercised the concentrated local power and influence that some of the leading north Wales families enjoyed. William, Sir Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1618), and Sir Roger Mostyn all sat in parliament, but it was local office and the authority that went with it that was important to them, and none of them had any desire to cut a figure at Westminster. However, they were among the leading patrons of the Welsh cultural tradition, the first Thomas Mostyn being the first to enjoy the close relationship with the bardic order that distinguished the family in the sixteenth century. The origins of this relationship are unclear, but William Mostyn was responsible for organizing the eisteddfod at Caerwys, Flintshire, in 1567, which was intended as a public examination of the poets' professional skills. His grandfather Richard ap Hywel was similarly involved in the first Caerwys eisteddfod in 1523.<br>
