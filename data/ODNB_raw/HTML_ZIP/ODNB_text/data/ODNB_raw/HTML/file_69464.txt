<span class="headword">Wheeler,  (William) Gordon</span>  (1910&#150;1998), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Leeds</span>, was born on 5 May 1910 at Hillcrest in the village of Dobcross, Saddleworth, Yorkshire, the first child of Frederick Wheeler (1880&#150;1971), cloth bleacher and finisher, and his wife, Marjorie (1881&#150;1938), daughter of William Barber Upjohn of Worsley, Lancashire, and his wife, Mary. His only sibling, Marjorie Elizabeth, was born in 1912. Gordon Wheeler (as he was always known to family and friends) was baptized at St Mark's parish church, Worsley, on 3 July 1910, and his family's deep Anglican faith was a formative influence on his early life and career. He was educated at Manchester grammar school (1924&#150;9) and at University College, Oxford (1929&#150;32), from where he graduated with a second in history. He then chose to study for the Anglican priesthood at St Stephen's House, Oxford (1932&#150;3); he was ordained to the diaconate in December 1933 by the bishop of Chichester, George Bell, and in December 1934 he was ordained priest by the bishop of Derby in All Saints' Cathedral, Derby. Between 1933 and 1936 he served as curate at St Bartholomew's, Brighton, and at St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield, and then at Lancing College, Sussex, as an assistant chaplain and master. From an early age he identified firmly with the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England, and he developed an admiration for Cardinal Newman. At various times he considered whether to become a Roman Catholic; he finally decided to do so in 1936 and was received into that church at Downside Abbey on 18 September of that year. Subsequently he went to Rome and the Beda College (1936&#150;40) to prepare for his ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood. This took place at Westminster Cathedral on 31 March 1940 and was performed by the archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Hinsley. His first appointment in the Westminster diocese was to the parish of St Edmund, Edmonton, as assistant priest. He remained there until 1944, when he joined the staff of Westminster Cathedral with responsibility for editing the <span class="italic">Westminster Cathedral Chronicle</span>. In 1950 he became the Catholic chaplain to the University of London. Pope Pius XII appointed him a privy chamberlain in 1952.<br>
<br>In 1954 the archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Bernard Griffin, appointed Wheeler administrator of Westminster Cathedral, a post he held for the next ten years. In 1955 he was created a domestic prelate to Pope Pius XII, and the following year he became a chaplain to the British Association of the Sovereign and Military Order of Malta. From 1991 to 1995 he was the association's principal chaplain.<br>
<br>Wheeler enjoyed a reputation as an able administrator, a fine intellect, and a man of great charm and wit. It was accepted that he was destined to become a bishop, and in 1964 Pope Paul VI appointed him coadjutor bishop of Middlesbrough, to assist the bishop of the diocese, George Brunner. He was consecrated bishop by the apostolic delegate Archbishop Igino Cardinale at St Mary's Cathedral, Middlesbrough, on 19 March 1964. He expected in due course to succeed Bishop Brunner, but in 1966 he was appointed as the seventh bishop of Leeds, following the translation of George Patrick Dwyer to the archdiocese of Birmingham the previous year. He was enthroned as bishop of Leeds in St Anne's Cathedral, Leeds, on 27 June 1966. He retired on 10 September 1985 and was granted the title of bishop emeritus of Leeds.<br>
<br>Although Wheeler's cultural and educational background may have differed from that of most of his fellow bishops in the English Catholic church of the 1960s, he shared with them a common task: implementing at diocesan level the far-reaching decisions taken by the Second Vatican Council of 1962&#150;5. To that end he established the Wood Hall Pastoral and Ecumenical Centre in 1967, the Diocesan Pastoral Council, and the Diocesan Justice and Peace Commission: all important initiatives which placed him at the forefront of post-conciliar reform. In 1971 he became the first English bishop to ordain married men to the diaconate; he also accepted as candidates for the priesthood several married Anglican clergymen who had converted to the Catholic faith, although their ordinations did not take place until after Wheeler retired. In later years, and in hindsight, he tended to regret that his initiatives had not achieved more to disseminate the fruits of the Second Vatican Council, and wondered whether it would have been preferable to concentrate on promoting this aim in the parishes both among priests and lay people.<br>
<br>This self-assessment was rather severe, for Wheeler had achieved much. Undoubtedly he was at heart a theological and liturgical conservative; nevertheless he accepted that the church has always undergone development in these and other areas. Thus he accommodated and, indeed, promoted innovation; it was this, together with his sympathetic approach to troubled individuals and situations, which enabled him to guide his diocese through the upheavals and controversies of the period relatively unscathed, not least through the aftermath of the 1968 encyclical <span class="italic">Humanae vitae</span>. Wheeler's achievement was an example to the wider English Catholic church and helps to explain why he was seen by some as a potential archbishop of Westminster when Cardinal Heenan died in 1975. In the event it was Gordon Wheeler who promoted the cause of Heenan's eventual successor, the abbot of Ampleforth, Dom Basil Hume.<br>
<br>Having taken part himself in the later sessions of the Second Vatican Council, Wheeler envisaged the spiritual and intellectual renewal of the church through a balanced consideration and implementation of its decrees, in contrast to what he saw, from the viewpoint of a &#145;progressive traditionalist&#146;, as frequently expressed misinterpretations and misrepresentations. In 1969 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Let's Get this Straight</span> in which he argued that the council was not the cause of &#145;unrest and uncertainty&#146; but was in fact &#145;God's answer&#146; to the troubles and problems of the age. At the national level he was able to influence some of the most significant changes to emerge from the council, through his membership of the National Liturgical Commission, which he chaired from 1970 to 1975, and of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy. His loyalty to the council was evident in 1980, when he ceded fifty parishes from the Leeds diocese to form the greater part of the new diocese of Hallam, centred on Sheffield; as a consequence his former auxiliary bishop, Gerald Moverley, became the first bishop of Hallam. In this way Wheeler accepted the principle that a modern diocese should, as far as possible, be of a size which enables a single bishop to provide effective administration and pastoral care.<br>
<br>As bishop of Leeds Wheeler lived at Eltofts, near Thorner, on the outskirts of the city in a style characterized by &#145;warm hospitality, gracious manners [and] the highest standards&#146;, in the words of Cardinal Basil Hume  (<span class="italic">Diocese of Leeds Directory 1999</span>, 124). In retirement he went to reside at the College of the Blessed Virgin in Headingley, where he was cared for by the Little Sisters of the Poor. As his successor, Bishop David Konstant, later recalled, Wheeler's retirement was &#145;everything that such a time should be&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tablet</span>), and it was during these years that he wrote his memoirs, <span class="italic">In Truth and Love</span> (1990), and compiled a collection of homilies and essays, <span class="italic">More Truth and Love</span> (1994). He died on 20 February 1998 at Mount St Joseph's home, Shire Oak Road, Leeds, and his funeral took place at St Anne's Cathedral on 3 March; on the same day he was buried in the crypt of St Edward's Church, Clifford, near Boston Spa in Yorkshire. While some may have regarded Gordon Wheeler as &#145;the last of the prince-bishops&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), on its own this would be a superficial judgement; he was a man of strong faith and deep prayer, a holy man who was also &#145;an urbane and effective diocesan bishop&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) at one of the most turbulent periods in the modern history of the Catholic church.<br>
