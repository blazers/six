<span class="headword">Fane,  Julian Henry Charles</span>  (1827&#150;1870), <span class="occ">diplomatist and poet</span>, fifth (but fourth surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9137/', "John Fane, eleventh earl of Westmorland (1784&#150;1859)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9140/', "Priscilla Anne Fane, n&#233;e Wellesley-Pole, countess of Westmorland (1793&#150;1879)")</script>, was born on 10 October 1827 at Florence, where his father was minister. He was educated at Thames Ditton (1838&#150;41) and Harrow School, before proceeding in 1847 to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, and in 1850 took the chancellor's medal for English verse with a poem on the death of Queen Adelaide, and his MA. In 1844 he joined the diplomatic service as unpaid attach&eacute; to his father's mission in Berlin. After graduating, he went in a similar capacity to Vienna in September 1851, and was promoted in December to paid attach&eacute;. He remained in Vienna until 1856, when he attended the congress of Paris as part of Lord Clarendon's special mission. He was then appointed secretary of legation at St Petersburg, before transferring back to Vienna in 1858. He was promoted to first secretary acting charg&eacute; d'affaires at Paris in 1865, was protocolist to the conferences on Luxembourg held in London from 7 to 13 May 1867, and took charge of the Paris embassy in the interregnum between Lord Cowley and Lord Lyons, but he resigned the diplomatic service from ill health in June 1868.<br>
<br>Fane's ambitions were, however, literary. In 1852 he published a volume <span class="italic">Poems</span>, which included a sequence of poems entitled &#145;Ad matrem&#146;, and in 1854 he brought out a translation of Heinrich Heine's poems. With Edward Lytton, whom he met in Paris in 1856, he wrote <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user, or, The Battle of the Bards</span>, which was published in 1861 under the pseudonyms of Neville Temple and Edward Trevor, although, as Fane told Lord Houghton, he and Lytton early agreed &#145;to commit a few discreet indiscretions in revealing our poor secret&#146;  (Reid, 2.69). Lord Clarendon commented, &#145;there are some very pretty things in it but it is <i>hardly</i> decent&#151;at least it wd not do to read aloud to young Ladies&#146;  (Kennedy, 166). Fane also wrote occasionally for the reviews, notably an assessment of Robert Browning's <span class="italic">The Ring and the Book</span> in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (1869). Lord Derby observed after Fane's death that &#145;He had a strong fancy that his talents were thrown away in diplomacy (which was, on the contrary, exactly the proper sphere for them) and that he should some day earn a great literary reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 56).<br>
<br>&#145;A most fascinating man&#146;  (Hewett, 35), Fane belonged to the social set based around Lady Waldegrave's houses at Nuneham Park (which he apostrophized in one of his 1852 poems) and Strawberry Hill. Handsome, and accounted &#145;dangerous&#146;, he was reported to be &#145;killing himself with women in Paris&#146;  (ibid., 92) in 1856. It was therefore something of a surprise when in 1866 he selected as his bride Lady Adine Eliza Anne Cowper (1843&#150;1868), third daughter of George, sixth Earl Cowper. Lady Adine was extremely shy: her sister-in-law said that &#145;Adine shut up like a telescope if anyone spoke to her&#146;  (Cowper, 171), which was hardly a recommendation for a diplomatist's wife. But the marriage was happy, and produced a daughter, Ettie [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40733/', "Grenfell, Ethel, Lady Desborough")</script>], and a son, John (who died in 1876). It was also short-lived. Lady Adine, who had always been delicate, died from typhoid pneumonia on 20 October 1868. Her husband did not long survive her. Julian Fane developed tuberculosis in a form that prevented his swallowing liquids and speaking for nearly a year before his death, which took place at his home, 29 Portman Square, London, on 18 April 1870.<br>
