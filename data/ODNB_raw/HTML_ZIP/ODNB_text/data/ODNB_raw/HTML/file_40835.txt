<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Kirkman Daniel</span>  (1814&#150;1879), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born in London, the first son of John Hodgson (<i>d</i>. 1857), of Hampstead, and his wife, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1884), daughter of Jean Delamain. His ancestors had been sugar refiners in eighteenth-century London. He was educated at Charterhouse School, and became a partner in the firm of Hodgson, general and commission merchants. Under its articles of partnership, dated 1859, he and his brother, and sole partner, James Stewart Hodgson each provided capital of &pound;80,000. In 1865 their firm merged with Kay, Finlay &amp; Co. of London, and Thomson, Finlay &amp; Co. of Liverpool, to form the new firm of Finlay Hodgson, with capital of &pound;360,000 divided into seventy-two shares, of which Kirkman Hodgson held fourteen. Finlay Hodgson acted as general and commission merchants until 1867, when it was absorbed by the merchant bank of Barings.<br>
<br>Thomas Baring (1799&#150;1873) was Hodgson's colleague on the board of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, and knowing him as a careful, clever, discreet man, Baring hoped that he would steady the bank's impulsive younger partners, E. C. Baring and Russell Sturgis. As Hodgson made only a limited impact at Barings, and is not associated with any particular achievement or responsibility, there was possibly an internal alliance to negate his influence. He was a partner from 1 July 1867 until his retirement, in consequence of illness, on 31 December 1878.<br>
<br>Hodgson was elected to the Political Economy Club in 1853, and gave evidence to House of Commons committees, such as those investigating commercial distress (1848) and the commercial crisis (1857&#150;8). It was at the suggestion in 1863 of Hodgson and Robert Crawford that G. J. Goschen (1831&#150;1907) stood for the City of London constituency, and forty years later Goschen described his two political sponsors as &#145;splendid specimens of the British Merchant, cultivated, versed in all the higher questions both of commercial and banking finance, and wielding an exceptional influence in the City&#146;  (Elliot, 47).<br>
<br>Hodgson was a director of the Bank of England from 1840 until 1878. He served as deputy governor in 1861&#150;3, and by rotation was governor in 1863&#150;5 during a difficult period in the American Civil War. His place in the bank's history is unostentatious. He was one of three financial experts who examined the accounts of the joint-stock bankers Overend and Gurney after its failure in 1866, and advised against attempting a rescue. As a result of his family's investments, Hodgson was a director from 1841 until his death of the Pelican Life Office, the life assurance company associated with the Phoenix Fire Insurance Office. Hodgson joined Phoenix's board in 1846, serving until his death. No particular policy or success is associated with him at Pelican or Phoenix, which in the mid-nineteenth century were both characterized by cautious and even stultified enterprise.<br>
<br>In politics he was an advanced Liberal whose judgement was respected by Gladstone. He was elected without contest as MP for Bridport, Dorset, in March 1857, and held the seat until November 1868, when he stood unsuccessfully at Penryn in Cornwall. He was elected for Bristol in June 1870, and was returned again at the head of the poll there in 1874. His health began to fail in the autumn of 1877, and in the winter session of 1878 he retired from parliament.<br>
<br>For many years Hodgson had a house near Watford, and was a magistrate, deputy lieutenant, and in 1845 high sheriff, of Hertfordshire. In London he lived at 67 Brook Street. He married, in 1843, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of John Laforey Butler, of Southgate, Middlesex, and had a son and daughter. In later life he acquired a seat at Ash Grove, Sevenoaks, Kent, where he died on 11 September 1879.<br>
