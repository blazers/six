<span class="headword">Martin family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1700&#150;1832), <span class="occ">bankers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_53422"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Martin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680, <em>d.</em> 1765)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at Evesham, Worcestershire, on 29 April 1680, the second and eldest surviving son of William Martin (1654&#150;1693), coroner and mayor of the borough of Evesham, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1699), daughter of John Knight of Barrels in the parish of Wootten Wawen, Warwickshire. He had five brothers and four sisters. Together with two of his younger brothers, <a href="#cosubject_53424">John [i] Martin [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_53423">James [i] Martin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, he was to make a distinctive and important contribution to the development of the Grasshopper, one of the most famous names in English banking.<h2>
<a name="Establishmentofthebankingtradition"></a>Establishment of the banking tradition</h2>The association of moneylending and the sign of the Grasshopper at 68 Lombard Street in the City of London are generally traced to Sir Thomas Gresham in the mid-sixteenth century. The contribution of the Martins in the eighteenth century was to build upon the continuous tradition of goldsmith activity at the Grasshopper, transforming it into one of the more prestigious and important of the London private banking houses. Thomas Martin left Evesham for London shortly before the end of the seventeenth century. By 1699 he was working as a clerk at the Grasshopper under Richard Smith, a distinguished goldsmith and partner in the firm, with which he was reputed to have a family connection. In this way he became the first of the Martin family to engage in the business of banking. Though he was made a partner in 1703, the entry of the Martins into banking was truly consolidated in 1711 when, on the death of the then senior partner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48246/', "Andrew Stone (d. 1711)")</script>, Thomas Martin took up the offer to buy Stone's share of the business made in his will. On payment of &pound;9000 he became senior partner, controlling the bank virtually single-handedly until 1714, when he brought James [i] Martin into the partnership. Always the dominant partner, Thomas Martin needed all his skill and ingenuity to steer the bank through the turbulent period of the South Sea Bubble and, though he formally retired in 1726, he remained a strong influence on the bank's affairs. Thomas Martin was a man of great integrity who made significant contributions in a variety of public roles. He married Elizabeth (1691&#150;1744), daughter of Richard Lowe of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire; they had no children. Through his wife's connections he became impropriator of the great tithes of Cheshunt. He was also MP for Wilton, Wiltshire, between 1727 and 1737. He lived in Lombard Street until 1716, when he moved to Clapham, Surrey, residing there until his death on 21 April 1765. He was buried shortly after at St Mary's Church, Cheshunt, in the same ground as his wife and younger brother William Martin (1684&#150;1757). He died a man of immense wealth, having established the name of Martin firmly within metropolitan banking circles. He left land and property in the counties of Hertfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex, in addition to his capital in the banking house. As he died without issue, his nephew <a href="#cosubject_53425">Joseph Martin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, second son of his brother John [i] Martin, became the chief beneficiary of his vast legacy.<br>
<br>From the mid-1720s the fortunes of the Grasshopper owed much to the skill and dedication of Thomas Martin's youngest brother, <a name="cosubject_53423"></a><span class="headword">James [i] Martin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1693, <em>d.</em> 1744)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized at Evesham on 22 October 1693. Apprenticed to his brother until becoming his partner in 1714, he became the bank's senior partner on Thomas Martin's retirement in 1726, a position he held until 1743. The bank continued to expand, providing a wide variety of personal banking services to the aristocracy and gentry. Caution was the watchword, though, and with its emphasis on private deposit banking, the style and conduct of the Grasshopper was more akin to the aristocratic West End banks than the more aggressive commercial houses of the City. Until the early 1720s James [i] Martin lived at the Three Crossed Daggers in Lombard Street, which served as the partners' City residence. About 1725 he purchased the estate and manor of Quy, Cambridgeshire, and subsequently became involved with the political life of the county. A conservator of the River Cam and a JP, he represented Cambridge in parliament between 1741 and 1744. His influence and connections secured the accounts of a number of Cambridge colleges for the Grasshopper. James [i] Martin remained a bachelor throughout his life and had no children. He died on 15 December 1744. His significance to the continuity and direction of the Martin family's involvement in the banking business in Lombard Street was to continue after his death. Having purchased the freehold to the Grasshopper some time after 1740, detailed arrangements were laid down in his will to ensure that the premises of the bank, together with his share of the capital stock, could pass to his nephew Joseph Martin, second son of his brother John [i] Martin, the only one of the first generation of Martins in the bank to have children.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_53424"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Martin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1692, <em>d.</em> 1767)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at Evesham on 8 July 1692. He began work at the Grasshopper about 1717, though he left in the early 1720s before securing a partnership in the business. According to the family archives, in 1720 he married Katherine (1696&#150;1762), daughter and heir of Joseph Jackson of Sneed Park, Gloucestershire. Together they had five sons and nine daughters. In 1723 John [i] Martin took on the lease of the estate at Overbury, Worcestershire, from the Parsons family, providing the first connection with what became the family seat. He rebuilt the main house following a severe fire in 1738. His eldest son, John [ii] Martin (1724&#150;1794), though he did not work at the bank, received a share of the profits and spent a great deal of money improving the estate. In 1761 he married Judith (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter and heir of William Bromley of Ham Court, Worcestershire. John [i] Martin's two other surviving sons, Joseph Martin and <a href="#cosubject_53426">James [ii] Martin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were to play key roles in deepening the family connection with the Grasshopper. Throughout his absence from Lombard Street, John [i] Martin was kept informed about the progress of the firm by James [i] Martin. On his brother's death in 1744, he returned to the capital to oversee the running of the banking house, becoming senior partner between 1744 and 1759. Despite the pressures of maintaining the Grasshopper in the front rank of London private banking houses, he still found time to become MP for Tewkesbury, in 1741&#150;7 and 1754&#150;61. His first wife died in 1762 and he married Anna Kinlock (<i>d</i>. 1765) in the following year. They had no children. He died on 7 March 1767 and was buried at Overbury, Worcestershire, on 25 March. With his death the extraordinary influence of the first generation of Martins in the Grasshopper came to an end. The family's position, controlling one of the City of London's important private banking houses, had been established.<h2>
<a name="Familyfortunesinthelatereighteenthcentury"></a>Family fortunes in the later eighteenth century</h2>
<a name="cosubject_53425"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Martin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> 1776)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized on 19 January 1726 at St Martin's Church, Outwich, City of London. He was apprenticed at the Grasshopper in the early 1740s, under the tutelage of his uncle James [i] Martin. In 1746 he was brought into partnership with his father, John [i] Martin, under the conditions of his uncle's will. On his father's retirement in 1759, he became the bank's senior partner, maintaining this role until 1775, a year before his death. One of the most important achievements of his tenure at the bank was ensuring the Grasshopper's full and active participation in the formation of the London clearing house in 1773, which helped to expedite the settling of balances between bankers without the need to transfer cash. The bank also participated in the financing of various turnpike promotions and added a variety of prestigious account holders, including Sir Francis Baring and the dean and chapter of Worcester. On 6 February 1749 Joseph Martin married Eleanor (1730&#150;1812), daughter of Sir John Torriano, British envoy at Florence. Together they had seven sons and six daughters. None of his sons followed him into the bank, though his second daughter, Eleanor (1755&#150;1831), married John Foote, a partner in the Grasshopper. Joseph Martin lived for many years in Downing Street, Westminster, also maintaining a house at Eastwick, Surrey. An MP for both Gatton, Surrey, between 1768 and 1774, and Tewkesbury between 1774 and 1776, he was also elected sheriff of London in 1771. He died in Downing Street in April 1776 and was buried probably at St Mary's Church, Cheshunt. He died a very wealthy man, leaving land and property in the counties of Hertfordshire, Essex, Middlesex, Surrey, Gloucestershire, Norfolk, and also the Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>For many years Joseph Martin had worked closely in the management of the Grasshopper with his younger brother <a name="cosubject_53426"></a><span class="headword">James [ii] Martin</span>  (1738&#150;1810)<span class="occ"></span> who was born on 24 May 1738 at Overbury Court, Worcestershire. Apprenticed in the mid-1750s and becoming a partner in 1760, James [ii] Martin became senior partner on Joseph's retirement in 1775, holding that position until 1807. His signal achievement was to manage the bank through the very difficult conditions associated with the early years of the Napoleonic wars. By eschewing the provision of agency links with country banks, limiting exposure to the risks of financing provincial industry and overseas trade, while concentrating on providing deposit banking for the financially secure, the Grasshopper weathered the storm better than most. He married, on 17 February 1774, Penelope (1740&#150;1830), daughter of John Skipp of Upper Hall, Ledbury, Herefordshire, an estate she was to inherit, along with that of Whateley, in Warwickshire. Together they had three sons and four daughters. From an early age James [ii] Martin suffered from corpulence and laid out the walks in the Great Wood at Overbury in order to exercise, in the hope of relieving his condition. For much of his life in London he lived in Downing Street, next door to Pitt the younger, and the two were personal friends, though opposed in politics. Elected MP for Tewkesbury in 1776, he held the seat through successive parliaments until 1807. He died aged seventy-one on 26 January 1810 and was buried at Overbury, Worcestershire, on 3 February.<h2>
<a name="LatergenerationsandtheendofMartinsBank"></a>Later generations and the end of Martins Bank</h2>James [ii] Martin's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_53427"></a><span class="headword">John [iii] Martin</span>  (1774&#150;1832)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 27 November 1774 at Ledbury, was to become part of the third generation of Martins to serve the banking house in Lombard Street. The chief beneficiary of his father's considerable estate, which included the important title to the banking house in Lombard Street, John [iii] Martin joined his father in partnership in the 1790s after an apprenticeship at the Grasshopper. On his father's retirement in 1807 he became the bank's senior partner, a position he held until 1830. These were trying times for London bankers and John [iii] Martin had the difficult task of negotiating the difficult transition from war to peace after 1815 and the financial instability that ensued, culminating in the widespread financial crisis of 1825&#150;6. By cautious application and avoiding undue speculation, the Grasshopper came through the period relatively unscathed. The traditions laid down from the first generation of Martins in the bank of prudence, discretion, and balanced judgement, proved again of the greatest significance. On 5 March 1803 John [iii] Martin married Frances (1770&#150;1862), daughter of Richard Stone, a partner in the Grasshopper. They had five sons and two daughters. Three of his sons, John [iv] Martin (1805&#150;1880), James [iii] Martin (1807&#150;1878), and Robert Martin (1808&#150;1897), all became partners in the Grasshopper, ensuring the close connection of the Martin family with its development into the later nineteenth century. John [iii] Martin lived in Lombard Street and Downing Street, before moving out to Camden Place, Chislehurst, in Kent. He maintained the family tradition of representing Tewkesbury in parliament, being elected MP in 1812 and holding the seat through consecutive parliaments until his death. He died on 4 January 1832 at Chislehurst, Kent, at the age of fifty-seven, and was buried at Ledbury on 13 January 1832.<br>
<br>The Grasshopper remained a successful private bank until the Baring crisis of 1890 demonstrated the dangers of unlimited liability. In the following year, the partners decided to seek incorporation and the business became Martin's Bank Ltd in 1891. In 1918 it amalgamated with the Bank of Liverpool, becoming the Bank of Liverpool and Martins Ltd, the title reverting to Martins Bank Ltd in 1928. In 1969 the bank merged with Barclays Bank plc, after more than four hundred years of continuous banking activity on the same site in Lombard Street.<br>
