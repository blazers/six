<span class="headword">Venables,  George Stovin</span>  (1810&#150;1888), <span class="occ">barrister and journalist</span>, born on 18 June 1810 at Kirkethorpe, Yorkshire, was the second son of Richard Venables of Llysdinam Hall, Brecknockshire, archdeacon of Carmarthen and for twenty-five years chairman of the Radnorshire quarter sessions. George's mother was Sophia, daughter of George Lister of Girsby, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Charterhouse School at the same time as William Makepeace Thackeray, whose nose he is alleged to have broken in a fight. He proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, and in 1831 won the chancellor's medal for English verse, the subject being the &#145;North-West Passage&#146;. He graduated BA in 1832 and MA in 1835, was elected a fellow of Jesus College (1835&#150;68), and acted as tutor from 1835 to 1838.<br>
<br>Venables was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in June 1836, and joined the Oxford circuit, but eventually devoted himself to parliamentary practice, being made a queen's counsel in 1863. Simultaneously he pursued an anonymous career in journalism, setting the highest standards for journalism as a vehicle for political thought and for publishing faithful reports of public life. On 1 November 1855 he wrote the leading article in the first issue of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> and continued to make regular weekly contributions to the paper for more than thirty years. From 1857 onwards he also compiled, for at least twenty-five consecutive years, the summary of events published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the last day of every year. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Literary Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Victoria Regia</span>, and <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>. The only work published in his own name was his memoir of his closest friend, Henry Lushington, which was printed as a preface to Lushington's <span class="italic">Italian War</span> (1859). He had also printed privately in 1848, in conjunction with Henry Lushington, a volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Joint Compositions</span>. Venables retired from legal practice with a considerable fortune in 1882 and became the high sheriff of Radnor in 1884. He died on 6 October 1888 at his home, 67 Curzon Street, Mayfair, London.<br>
<br>The impression made by Venables upon many of the most distinguished of his contemporaries was that he was almost unequalled in the extraordinary force and charm of his character. As an advocate he displayed the most remarkable memory and powers of expression. He was considered a close friend by many leading figures of the day, such as Thackeray, Lord Tennyson, and Sir James Fitzjames Stephen. A year before his death a number of his friends, including Fitzjames Stephen, erected a window as a memorial of Venables and his two brothers, the Revd Richard Venables of Llysdinam Hall and Joseph Henry Venables (1813&#150;1866), barrister, in the church at Llysdinam, which he had built and endowed. It was inscribed &#145;Conditori hujus ecclesi&aelig; amicissimi quidam&#146;. Thackeray is alleged to have founded the character of George Warrington in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span> partly upon Venables. Tennyson accepted from Venables a line in &#145;The Princess&#146; (&#145;If that hypothesis of theirs be sound&#146;); the poem is dedicated to Henry Lushington. On hearing of his friend's death, Fitzjames Stephen wrote an article of warm appreciation on Venables in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>.<br>
