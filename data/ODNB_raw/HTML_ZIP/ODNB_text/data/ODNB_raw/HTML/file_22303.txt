<span class="headword">Pinney,  Charles</span>  (1793&#150;1867), <span class="occ">mayor of Bristol</span>, was born on 29 April 1793, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50514/', "John Pretor Pinney (1740&#150;1818)")</script>, sugar planter and merchant, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1821), only daughter of Major William Burt Weekes, both of Nevis, West Indies. John Pinney was originally named John Pretor, and assumed the surname and arms of Pinney by royal licence on succeeding to the Pinney estates in 1762. Charles Pinney was born after his return to England to live in Bristol. He took over his father's business interests to become a merchant and a slave owner, in partnership with E. Case at Bristol. After having apparently been on the point of proposing marriage to a daughter of Wilberforce, the abolitionist, on 8 March 1831 he married Frances Mary (<i>d</i>. 1860), fourth daughter of James Charles Still of East Knoyle, Wiltshire; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Pinney was a common councillor in Bristol from 1822 to 1835 and sheriff in 1823&#150;4, one of the few whigs on a council which in the early nineteenth century had become dominated by tories, and which was despised in the city as a self-interested oligarchy enjoying power without responsibility. Pinney himself was known as a friend of reform; he was president of the whig Anchor Society in 1822, had helped to found and presided over a mechanics' institute, and in September 1830 had chaired a public meeting which declared its sympathy with the French revolution of July.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1831 Pinney was sworn in as mayor of Bristol and thus had the misfortune to be in office during the riots that followed the rejection of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. The riots began on 29 October 1831 when Sir Charles Wetherell, the city recorder, who was very unpopular because of his opposition to reform, entered the city. It fell to Pinney as mayor to receive him. Crowds gathered to meet Wetherell and stoned the carriage in which he and Pinney were riding and later the mansion house where he and Pinney had repaired. Pinney tried to quieten the crowd on two occasions but, being met with abuse and missiles, read the riot act at dusk. Incensed, the crowd broke into the mansion house and ransacked the ground floor. Wetherell made an inglorious exit over the roof and left Bristol in disguise. The crowd began to disperse, some of their own volition, others after the arrival of troops who, under their commander Thomas Brereton, used only the flats of their swords. The crowd reassembled early on 30 October while the troops were resting and at about 7 a.m. attacked the mansion house again. Pinney followed Wetherell's example and escaped over the roof while the rioters looted the house. There followed widespread destruction of public buildings as the crowd attacked the Bridewell, the New Gaol, and the Gloucester county prison, liberating the prisoners before firing the buildings. They fired the bishop's palace, dock gates, customs house, and excise office, before turning to private houses in Queen Square, an area firmly associated with Bristol's commercial &eacute;lite and political establishment. They held an impromptu feast in Queen Square with food and drink looted from the corporation cellars and from other cellars in Queen Square which were used as wine vaults and as bonded warehouses for spirits. The volume of alcohol inflamed the tempers of the rioters and made the houses burn easily. Finally on the Monday the troops, now reinforced, and aided by some 4000 special constables, charged and cleared the crowd. Official figures suggest twelve were killed and ninety-four injured. More recently Harrison has suggested that between 120 and 250 were killed or injured  (Harrison, 299&#150;300). Of the 102 rioters who were taken prisoner, thirty-one were condemned to death and four in fact executed. Clemency was shown to the others after a petition on their behalf gathered 10,000 names, including those of people who had had their houses destroyed. Twenty-two were transported.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1832 Pinney was put on trial in the court of king's bench charged with neglect of duty in his office as mayor during the riots. After a trial lasting seven days the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, asserting that Pinney had &#145;acted according to the best of his judgement with zeal and personal courage&#146;  (Pinney, 1833). Although it is impossible to establish the course of events with certainty, since it is reconstructed from sometimes conflicting testimonies of witnesses and from conjecture about closed sessions of the mayor and magistrates, Pinney's acquittal seems fair, if kind. He had indeed tried to persuade the crowd to disperse, instructed Brereton to act decisively, and sworn in special constables, but all the blame for lack of co-ordination between the civil and military authorities, which had allowed the situation to get out of hand, was laid on Brereton.<br>
<br>Although triggered by a national issue, the crowd's anger is now seen as having been directed largely against the entrenched city corporation, to defend whose interests wealthier citizens were mostly unwilling to act as special constables. Given that his own views favoured reform, and that he received little support from magistrates all too aware of their own unpopularity, or from other citizens, or the military, Pinney probably acted no worse than most others would have done, faced with a crowd which began by obeying the customs of traditional protest, but, with access to unprecedented quantities of alcohol, took on a frightening aspect.<br>
<br>The riot by no means blighted Pinney's commercial or political career. He continued as a merchant and became president of the powerful Merchant Venturers' Society in 1844&#150;5. In 1835 he was chosen as one of the first aldermen of the reformed corporation and retained this office until 1853. He died at his home, Camp House, Clifton, Bristol, on 17 July 1867, leaving a substantial fortune proved at under &pound;60,000.<br>
