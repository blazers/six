<span class="headword">Little <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bewicke]</span>,  Alicia Ellen Neve</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Archibald Little]</span>  (1845&#150;1926), <span class="occ">author and campaigner against foot-binding</span>, was born in Madeira, the youngest of the three daughters and three sons of Calverley Bewicke (1816&#150;1864), a landowner, of Hallaton Hall, Leicestershire, and his wife, Mary Amelia, youngest daughter of the Revd Nathaniel John Hollingworth. She was educated at home in Madeira (1850&#150;65). For twenty years, until 1886, she lived in England, but she travelled widely. Her novels, written in her twenties and thirties, reveal her impatience with the marriage market of the English &#145;season&#146;. <span class="italic">Miss Standish</span> (1883), about a feminist spinster with passionate humanitarian convictions who finally achieves a marriage of true minds, seems clearly autobiographical and over a century later is still of interest to students of nineteenth-century British women's history. She also wrote a story, <span class="italic">Mother Darling</span> (1885), in support of the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span>, out of indignation at a woman's vulnerability in law if a blackguard husband sought to take their children and her property away. Allegedly she was fired by the plight of her own eldest sister.<br>
<br>On 2 November 1886 Alicia Bewicke married the merchant, Sinologist, and practical dreamer Archibald John Little (1838&#150;1908), who first opened the waters of the Yangtze (Yangzi) River to steam navigation; he was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37680/', "William John Little")</script>, physician. Together they went to live in the far west of China at Chungking (Chongqing) in Szechwan (Sichuan) province. After dogged persistence Alicia Little managed to out-face the crowd's astonishment at the sight of a European woman and to walk the streets of Chungking unmolested. But travelling in the wilds was more difficult; both she and her husband were sometimes pelted by foreigner-hating locals and at other times she had to try to pass for a male to be allowed shelter overnight. In 1900 they succeeded in reaching the frontier of Tibet.<br>
<br>Alicia Little was admiring of many aspects of Chinese culture, although deeply upset by the extreme poverty of the people. The routine infliction of torture to induce false confessions, she wrote, &#145;made one's blood boil&#146;  (Little, <span class="italic">The Land of the Blue Gown</span>, 193). What she found intolerable, however, was the continued, widespread foot-binding of Chinese girls as the traditional symbol of the girl's desire to please a future husband. She saw countless lame girls hobbling with sticks, dark lines under their sad eyes, their pale faces rouged to look healthy; she heard many gruesome accounts of gangrenous limbs, mortification, and amputations; she saw ladies having to be helped by their (unbound) women slaves to cross a room; she saw women carried on the backs of men like sacks because they could not walk, and knew that many died or committed suicide in civil wars because they could not flee; she learned from doctors of the lifelong injury done to Chinese women's internal organs from the necessity to throw the balance of their whole bodies on to their heels; and in the west of China she noted how poor women even tracked boats:<blockquote>with bound, hoof-like feet, besides carrying water, whilst in the north the unfortunate working women do field work, often kneeling on the heavy clay soil, because they are incapable of standing. It is only at Canton that bound feet are in any sense a mark of gentility, though in Shanghai and many other parts they are a sign of respectability. (ibid., 343)</blockquote>Alicia Little knew that a few missionaries had already campaigned against foot-binding, forbidding the practice to their own schoolgirls and even finding husbands willing to have them. But she also knew that this handful of Christians could have little influence on Confucian China, and that any reform movement she started must be quite separate from religious evangelizing. Therefore, in April 1895 she started the Tianzuhui or Natural Feet Society, first asking European ladies in Shanghai&#151;the wives of consuls and merchants&#151;for support. Full of trepidation&#151;for &#145;what were we to fight against centuries and millions?&#146;  (Little, <span class="italic">Intimate China</span>, 151)&#151;they published poems on the subject by two Chinese ladies and then medical tracts. They then reprinted and circulated the influential Suifu appeal by an eminent Chinese official: &#145;no pain [is] more injurious than the breaking of the bones and sinews &hellip; It makes the daughters cry day and night, aching with pain &hellip; I do not think much of such respect for ancestors&#146;. Other learned, scholarly tracts followed in classical Chinese with great authority, including one by a descendant of Confucius himself, and were posted as placards by her society all over China  (ibid., 154&#150;60).<br>
<br>With the moral support of her husband and his invaluable Chinese network of important contacts, including viceroys, Alicia Little then braced herself to make personal lecture tours throughout the cities of southern China as well as in Hong Kong and Macau. She used the recently invented R&ouml;ntgen X-ray slides as well as medical photographs to prove the crippling damage done to girls' growing bones. She spoke to businessmen, high officials, women's drawing-room meetings (with many hundreds of girls and women present), and assemblies of secondary-school boys&#151;who pledged themselves only to marry an unbound girl. She was immensely heartened by the founding of the first girls' high school in China in 1898&#151;all of whose pupils had to be unbound&#151;and she did not disdain the influence of a supportive inscription on her fan by the aged and much feared viceroy of Canton (Guangzhou), Lord Li Hongzhang.<br>
<br>For ten years (1896&#150;1906) Alicia Little was the vigorous and eloquent leader of the anti-foot-binding movement. She &#145;played a more active public role than any of her European contemporaries&#146;  (Croll, 23), and &#145;she, more than any one person, was responsible for the abolition of foot-binding in China&#146;  (Hoe, 19). She was even called the second Chinese goddess of mercy by the <i>taotai</i> of Foochow (Fuzhou). After her departure Chinese men and women carried on the movement and eventually it triumphed over the whole of China. She returned to England in 1908, after her husband's death, and lived first at Falmouth, Cornwall, and from 1909 in London. There she supported the British women's suffrage movement, which she had earlier championed in <span class="italic">Miss Standish</span>. Her written records and photographs of China at the end of the nineteenth century became a historical source for Western students of Chinese history. She died a childless but beloved, eccentric aunt at her home, 34 Stamford Road, Kensington, London, on 31 July 1926.<br>
