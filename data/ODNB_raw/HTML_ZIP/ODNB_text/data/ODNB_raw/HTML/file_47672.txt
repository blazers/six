<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sen, Keshub Chunder</span>  (1838&#150;1884), <span class="occ">religious reformer</span>, second son of Pyarimohan (<i>d</i>. 1848/9) and Saradasundari (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Das) Sen, was born in Calcutta on 19 November 1838. His grandfather, Ramkamal Sen, <i>diwan</i> of both the Bengal Bank and the mint at Calcutta, was among the luminaries of the nineteenth-century Bengal renaissance. Pyarimohan, his second son, succeeded him at the mint. Keshub's father died when the boy was ten, but the family was prosperous and he grew up in the lap of luxury. An early influence which shaped his spiritual development was the deep devotionalism of his family environment.<br>
<br>He was educated at the Hindoo College as well as at the Metropolitan College. When the former was reorganized as Hindu School and Presidency College, Keshub went to Presidency College, where he studied until 1858. There he was the chief organizer of the British India Society, a very influential discussion group where he learned his first lessons in oratory for which he was later to become famous. The young men of the Sen family also set up in 1856 the Colootola Branch School, where children from less fortunate homes were provided with regular instruction free of charge. Also in 1856 he married Jaganmohini, the nine-year-old daughter of Chandranath Majumdar. He entered the married state in a puritanical mood, committed to self-restraint. His spiritual aspirations were first expressed in the founding of the Goodwill Fraternity, in which a few friends got together to discuss matters of the spirit. This led to the next step, in which he lost faith in the idolatrous rituals of his ancestral faith, and joined the theistic Brahmo Samaj, revived and reorganized by Debendranath Tagore. He left the family home with his wife and they went to live with the Tagores for some time in 1859. Debendranath set up the Calcutta Brahmo Samaj on an independent footing and Sen became one of its secretaries. He gave up his job at the Bank of Bengal in 1861 to devote himself to the work of the Samaj on a full-time basis.<br>
<br>Welfare activities became a new plank in the Samaj's programme under his leadership. Relief work during the malaria epidemic of 1861&#150;2, finance to the famine stricken in north-western India, propaganda in favour of women's education, and the founding of a model educational institution, the Calcutta College, were among his major initiatives at this time. He also became the managing editor and in 1865 the proprietor of the Brahmo mouthpiece, the <span class="italic">Indian Mirror</span>. He started going out on tours of religious propaganda from 1861 onwards. In 1864 he went to Madras and Bombay, where he met Dadabhai Naoroji. The Maharashtrian leader M. G. Ranade helped to found the Prarthana Samaj (&#145;prayer society&#146;) inspired by Sen's preaching. Sen's tours were inspired by a pan-Indian ideology and he paved the way for political initiatives inspired by the same ideal.<br>
<br>His reformist zeal, especially his attempt to establish an association of Brahmo representatives from all parts of India, Pratinidhi-Sabha, to run the society on a democratic basis, created tensions with Tagore. Eventually Sen and his friends left the organization and set up the Brahmo Samaj of India (Bharatvarshiya Brahmosamaj) in 1866. This emphasis on a pan-Indian identity became a hallmark of all his activities. He went on a propaganda tour of northern India in 1867 and on his return talked of the need to institute a system of active co-operation among educated Indians of all presidencies and provinces, nearly twenty years before the founding of the Indian National Congress. The Bharatvarshiya Brahmomandir (&#145;Brahmo temple of India&#146;) was established in 1869 and it recognized the equal rights of men and women. Sen's efforts to legalize inter-caste marriage and the Brahmo marriage ritual, which avoided idolatrous elements, led to the <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> of 1872.<br>
<br>Sen went to England in 1870 with five of his brethren in faith. There he established extensive contacts with scholars, religious leaders, and politicians, including W. E. Gladstone. He was also received by Queen Victoria, and returned to India full of enthusiasm for British rule in India and an emotional loyalty towards the queen. He was also keen to secure for India some of the benefits of the modern civilization he had witnessed in England, and set up the Indian Reform Association with this end in view. It had a five-fold agenda which emphasized education for women, craft schools, the education of the working classes, cheap periodicals for the poor, and agitation to fight the widespread evil of alcohol, and also raised funds to assist people in need. People from all communities assisted in the effort. Mary Carpenter, who went to India in 1866, and Annette Ackroyd (later Mrs Beveridge) helped in the attempt to spread education. The Bengal Social Science Association, partly inspired by Ackroyd, became a forum for propaganda in favour of women's rights. A journal for women, <span class="italic">Bamabodhini Patrika</span>, was one of the products of Sen's efforts. His loyalist concerns led to the foundation of the Albert Institute and Albert Hall on College Street, Calcutta, in 1876: its object was to counteract the growing animosity between the ruler and the ruled.<br>
<br>In 1872 he met Swami Dayananda Saraswati, the revivalist preacher, and his friendship with the mystic Ramakrishna Paramahansa from 1875 onwards profoundly influenced his spiritual development. His growing inclination towards an eclectic faith was partly induced by these encounters. But his conservatism and somewhat dictatorial ways led to tensions with his younger followers like Sibnath Shastri, who wanted to run the Samaj on truly democratic lines, and who had views on women's freedom more advanced than those of Sen. The crunch came when Sen agreed to give the elder of his two daughters, then aged thirteen, in marriage to the prince of Cooch Behar, in violation of the Samaj's principles. A section of his followers seceded and formed a new sect, Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. Sen moved more and more in the direction of an eclectic and emotional mysticism, eventually founding a new movement called Nababidhan (&#145;new dispensation&#146;).<br>
<br>His public speeches had for many years been an important influence on the youth of Calcutta, but towards the closing years of his life he lost much of his appeal, in part because his credibility had been damaged by the Cooch Behar marriage. But there were more important reasons. His emphasis on loyalty to the British was ceasing to provide an acceptable ideology for the educated young, who were moving towards a more radical outlook and the ideal of independence. Keshub Chunder Sen died in Calcutta on 8 January 1884, by which time he had few followers left.<br>
