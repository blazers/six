<span class="headword">Williams,  Watkin Hezekiah</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Watcyn Wyn]</span>  (1844&#150;1905), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and poet</span>, was born on 14 March 1844 at Cwmgarw, Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, the second of the ten children of Hezekiah Williams, farmer, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. He was brought up on his father's farm of Cwmgarw Ganol, near Ammanford. At eight years of age he was employed in the coalmines then being opened up in the district, and he worked, chiefly as a collier, with occasional periods of attendance at various local schools, until the age of twenty-seven. On 9 April 1870 he married Mary Jones (1846/7&#150;1871), a dressmaker of Trap, Carreg Cennen; she died three weeks after giving birth to their child, and within a year of their marriage. This led Williams to quit his home and occupation, and in January 1872 he entered the school of a relative, Evan Williams of Merthyr Tudful. His progress was rapid, and he was soon able to give assistance in teaching to Evan Williams and his successor, J. J. Copeland. In 1874 he resolved to qualify for the Independent ministry; he returned home, began to preach at Gibea Chapel, and, after a little preliminary training, was admitted to the Presbyterian college at Carmarthen in 1875. During this period he was writing poetry and being guided by Richard Williams (Gwydderig) who tutored him in <i>cynghanedd</i>. On the conclusion of his course he married Anne Davies (<i>b</i>. 1853/4) of Llanelli on 10 July 1879, and accepted, instead of a pastorate, a post as teacher of a private school at Llangadog. Differences among the staff led to his moving, with the Revd D. E. Williams, to Ammanford in 1880, where the two friends founded the Hope Academy, a school which prepared pupils for the nonconformist ministry and other professions. In 1884 Watkin became the highly regarded principal of Ysgol y Gwynfryn, as the Hope Academy was now known, and remained so until his death. He was ordained an Independent minister in 1894, but held no pastoral charge.<br>
<br>Watcyn Wyn, as Williams was generally known, was an inspiring and original teacher, whose vivacity and wit endeared him to his pupils and whose early struggles made him a sympathetic guide of young men eager for learning. He had also a wide reputation as a Welsh poet, dating from 1875, when he divided a prize with Islwyn 
    (William Thomas; 1832&#150;1878)
   at Pwllheli. Both the silver crown and the bardic chair, the two chief poetic prizes of the eisteddfod, were won by him: the former at Merthyr in 1881 for a poem in free metre, &#145;Life&#146;, and the latter at Aberd&acirc;r in 1885 for an ode in the strict metres entitled &#145;The truth against the world&#146;. He was also the winner of the crown at the world fair eisteddfod of 1893 at Chicago, the subject being George Washington. These longer productions are not so likely, however, to preserve his memory as the lyrical and humorous poems which came so easily from his pen. Important among his publications are <span class="italic">Caneuon</span> (n.d. [1871]; 2nd edn, 1873); <span class="italic">Hwyr ddifyrion</span> (1883); <span class="italic">Llenyddiaeth Gymreig</span>, a survey of Welsh literature (1900); <span class="italic">Storiau Cymru</span>, versified folk tales (1907); and other works including two novels, <span class="italic">Irfon mere dydd</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Nansi</span> (1906), co-authored with Elwyn Thomas. His best-known hymn, still sung in Welsh congregations, is &#145;Rwy'n gweld o bell y dydd yn dod&#146;. A number of his poems appeared translated in Edward Thomas's <span class="italic">Beautiful Wales</span> (1905). His autobiography, <span class="italic">Adgofion Watcyn Wyn</span>, edited by J. Jenkins (Gwili), appeared in 1907.<br>
<br>Williams died of heart failure on 19 November 1905 at his home, Gwynfryn, Ammanford, and was buried there in Gellimanwydd cemetery.<br>
