<span class="headword">English,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1219&#150;1231), <span class="occ">physician and astronomer</span>, is known only through references in his own works or in the manuscripts in which those works are found. He says of himself that he was born in England and settled at Marseilles, and describes himself as a practising physician, learned in astronomy. There is a question as to whether he knew Arabic. Among the works doubtfully attributed to him is the translation, from Arabic, of a short treatise in the tradition of Kiranides, as <span class="italic">De virtute aquile</span> (&#145;On the virtue of the eagle&#146;). The manuscript in which it is found  (Oxford, Merton College, MS 324, fol. 14<i>r</i>) gives the translator as &#145;magister Willelmus Anglicus&#146;. It is true that in his genuine astronomical works William English introduced new Arabic material, but most probably he gathered his information through hearsay, perhaps through Jewish scholars.<br>
<br>Four works can be attributed to English with confidence. <span class="italic">De urina non visa</span> (&#145;On unseen urine&#146;) is found in numerous manuscripts and consists of a short treatise on astrological medicine. It first deals with the general principles of astrology applied to the parts of human body and their diseases; then follow some medical details about the liver (supposed to &#145;cook&#146; urine) and some rules governing the evolution of diseases. The aim of this work, which influenced a few other treatises of the same kind, was to offer a method, founded on astrology, of making diagnosis and prognosis without examining the urine of the patient. In one anecdote English says that he predicted exactly, during the year 1219, that a patient would continue to live two months and eight days. According to the given astral positions, this event took place at the very end of 1219, thus placing the redaction of the treatise after this time. A French version of <span class="italic">De urina non visa</span> was transcribed in 1463 by Johannes de Boorles  (Turin, Biblioteca Nazionale, MS M IV 11, fols. 125&#150;131<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The second work, <span class="italic">Astrologia</span>, is found in four manuscripts, one of which  (Seville, Biblioteca Capitular y Colombina, MS 5-1-25, fols. 1&#150;33) gives 1220 as the date of composition and the author as &#145;magister Werbellinus, civis Massiliensis, qui anglicus est natione&#146; (&#145;Master Werbellinus, citizen of Marseilles, who is English by birth&#146;). It presents the theory of planets according to Ptolemy's <span class="italic">Almagest</span>, focusing on the principles ruling the construction of astrolabes and the establishing of astronomical tables. Without explicitly mentioning them, English relied on the Toledan tables.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Astrolabium Arzachelis</span> is dated 1231 in some manuscripts and appears as the first introduction (actually rather clumsy) into the Latin West of the universal astrolabe known as the <i>saphea [Arzachelis]</i>, that is, &#145;Arzachel's plate&#146;. The astrolabe is universal in the sense that it is not restricted to a particular geographical latitude; Arzachel (Ibn al-Zarqali) was an eleventh-century Toledan astronomer. Contrary to what has sometimes been stated, the work by English is not an abridgement of that of Arzachel (which was translated into Latin in 1263 by Profatius) and English declares that he worked for six years on this topic. Both sections of the <span class="italic">Astrolabium Arzachelis</span> have been edited: the first, on the construction of the <i>saphea</i>, by L. A. S&eacute;dillot  (<span class="italic">M&eacute;moire sur les instruments astronomiques des Arabes</span>, <span class="roman">M&eacute;moires Pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s par Divers Savants &agrave; l'Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres</span>, 1st ser., 1, 1841, 185&#150;8; reprinted in R. T. Gunther, <span class="italic">The Astrolabes of the World</span>, 1, 1932, 259&#150;62) and the second, on the uses of the <i>saphea</i>, by P. Tannery  (&#145;Le trait&eacute; du quadrant de ma&icirc;tre Robert Angl&egrave;s&#146;, <span class="italic">Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale</span>, 35, 1897, 75&#150;80; reprinted in P. Tannery, <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires scientifiques</span>, 5, 1922, 190&#150;97). At the end of the treatise is appended a table of the stars (<span class="italic">De stellis fixis</span>), which has sometimes been wrongly considered as an independent work.<br>
<br>The fourth work by English is <span class="italic">Tractatus de metheoris</span>. The only manuscript in which this is found  (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 6552, fols. 39<i>v</i>&#150;41<i>v</i>) gives 1230 as the date of composition. Contrary to what is stated in the rubric title (which has been repeated by all scholars), it is a summary of the four books of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Meteorologics</span>, not of the fourth book only, even though it begins with this&#151;English ordered his matter according to where the phenomena take place: in the earth, in the air, or in the ether. The interest of this <span class="italic">Tractatus</span> lies in its early date.<br>
<br>The attribution of other works to William English is very doubtful. The <span class="italic">Scripta Marsiliensis</span> cannot have been written, on the evidence of their content, before the end of the thirteenth century. The supposed translation of Canamusali's treatise on ophthalmology is actually a compilation by a twelfth-century Salernitan physician, David Armenicus. Other works also should be rejected: <span class="italic">De quadratura circuli</span>, <span class="italic">Questio de scientia</span>, <span class="italic">Utrum in maiori quantitate &hellip;</span>, <span class="italic">De qualitatibus et proprietatibus signorum</span>. The identification of William English with William of Aragon, author of a commentary on Pseudo-Ptolemy's <span class="italic">Centiloquium</span> and of a treatise on dreams, is not firmly grounded.<br>
<br>William English was during the sixteenth century confused with <a name="cosubject_11648"></a><span class="headword">William Grisaunt</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>1350) in the writings of the controversialist John Bale. Grisaunt was the name which Bale, in his <span class="italic">Acta pontificum Romanorum</span> (1558), gave to the father of Pope Urban V (<i>r</i>. 1362&#150;70) and he described him as a <span class="occ">physician</span> born in England. In the second edition of his <span class="italic">Scriptorum illustrium maioris Brytanniae catalogus</span> (1557&#150;9), Bale added that the pope's father had studied philosophy at Merton College, Oxford, and medicine at the University of Montpellier and he attributed to him the works which he had entered in his notebook (<span class="italic">Index</span>), without any date, under the name of William English. In fact Urban V's father, named Guillelmus, was lord of Grisac (hence the derivation &#145;Grisaunt&#146;), near Mende in the southern Auvergne. He was not born in England, nor was he a physician. The confusion may have arisen from the fact of Pope Urban's brother having been named Anglic (&#145;Anglicus&#146;). While he was bishop of Avignon, and later of Albano, Anglic contributed to the papal foundation of colleges in Montpellier, among them the college of Mende (also called the &#145;college of the twelve physicians&#146;) for students of medicine. Modern authorities have rejected Bale's statements concerning the father of Urban V, but have continued to refer to a William Grisaunt (<i>fl</i>. 1350), a physician supposed to have studied at Oxford and Montpellier. This physician probably never existed.<br>
