<span class="headword">Sexby,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1616&#150;1658), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and conspirator</span>, described speculatively as the son of Marcus Sexby, alias Saxbie, of London, gentleman, was probably born about 1616, if the identification is correct, for in 1632, one Edward Sexby was apprenticed to Edward Price of the Grocers' Company, London. Sexby would later claim that his origins lay in Suffolk, but this is not inconsistent with his father's being a Londoner by the time Edward himself embarked on professional life.<br>
<br>Sexby entered Oliver Cromwell's double regiment of &#145;Ironsides&#146; in 1643. At the foundation of the New Model Army Sexby was a trooper in the horse regiment of Lord General Thomas Fairfax. He went on to be &#145;the most radical of the original agitators&#146;  (Woolrych, 41), although doubt has been cast on the claim that he was a close associate of John Lilburne. On 30 April 1647 Sexby was interrogated at the bar of the House of Commons for his part in drafting, circulating, and presenting to the commander-in-chief an <span class="italic">Apologie of the Common Soldiers</span>, a key text in the radicalization of the parliamentary army, the first manifesto drawn up by the elective representatives of the ordinary soldiery. That summer, Sexby helped organize and maintain the solidarity of the army, acquiring with money provided by the senior officers, a printing press for the army and also acting as treasurer, reimbursing the expenses of the agitators of the regiments as they moved around the country and came to meetings of the general council of the army. He may have had a hand in seizing the king at Holdenby House. He was certainly among the twelve sent by Fairfax to lay charges against the eleven members on 16 July 1647. When the counsels of the military began to fracture in the autumn, Sexby performed the function of intermediary between the general council of officers and agitators and the overlapping organization comprising the so-called &#145;new agents&#146;, the radical cavalrymen who sought a republican constitution and the introduction of a very wide franchise indeed. It has been strongly argued that Sexby was at least part author of <span class="italic">The Case of the Armie Truly Stated</span>, the manifesto of the new agents.<br>
<br>At those sessions of the Putney debates inspired by <span class="italic">The Case</span>, and by the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, Sexby vigorously opposed the actions of his superiors in seeking to negotiate a peace with the king. Against those such as Henry Ireton who insisted that political enfranchisement depended on having a material stake in the life of the nation, Sexby championed the rights of ordinary soldiers to have a say in the future settlement of England irrespective of property ownership, and insisted that manhood suffrage &#145;was the ground that wee tooke uppe armes&#146;, a view for which he was roundly rebuked by Cromwell among others  (Woolrych, 238&#150;9). Although it has been argued that Sexby was instrumental in forestalling the even more radical agenda at Putney, represented by the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, at the close of the momentous debates in November 1647 he openly avowed his anti-monarchical loyalties. He signed the <span class="italic">Copy of a Letter Sent by the Agents of Severall Regiments</span>, which was printed and distributed around 11 or 12 November 1647, calling on the regiments of the army to disobey the order for three separate rendezvous, and to join together to resist the grandees of the general command. However, his own regiment had evidently ceased heeding him, and took no part in the fleeting insurrection which happened at Ware.<br>
<br>Sexby appears to have left the army at the close of 1647, but he happened to be at the battle of Preston and was entrusted with a dispatch to the speaker of the House of Commons from Cromwell announcing the parliamentary victory there. MPs rewarded this service with a gift to Sexby of &pound;100. In February 1649 Sexby &#145;acted promptly&#146;, and apparently without any direct order from either parliament or council of state, in seizing the Scottish commissioners in England as they were about to take ship for home after roundly condemning the execution of Charles I. Sexby was briefly engaged thereafter in searching the posts at Dover and occasionally apprehending individuals suspected of threatening the security of the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>While John Lilburne and his associates languished in prison for their excoriating attacks on the tyranny of the free state, and Sexby's former radical cohort in the ranks of the army launched the mutiny which came to grief at Burford, the agitator Sexby himself became a prized trophy of the new regime, taking up a commission as a captain of foot and governor of Portland Castle. In June 1650 he was commissioned first as lieutenant-colonel, then as colonel, to command a regiment raised originally for service in Ireland, but subsequently diverted to Scotland. Sexby and his regiment headed north late in 1651. Certain &#145;miscarriages&#146; dogged their progress, principally caused by the indiscipline of the men, brought on by a lack of pay. The regiment took part at the siege of Tantallon Castle in February 1651. In the following June Sexby was charged by a court martial with a host of irregularities, including false musters and the execution of a soldier contrary to justice. Given his attitude in 1647, it is ironic that Sexby was eventually cashiered from his command for withholding the pay of several Portland soldiers who had refused to serve under him when he was originally bound for Ireland.<br>
<br>A few months after the loss of his commission, Sexby was chosen by the council of state as an unofficial envoy to the Frondeurs, with a view to fanning the flames of revolt in south-west France. Based at Bordeaux, his activities were regarded with grave suspicion by many among the supporters of the prince of Cond&eacute;. However, Sexby was able to commend to the republican Orm&eacute;e faction some of those radical ideas which he had effectively abandoned when he entered the service of the English Commonwealth. In the spring of 1653 he even had a hand in drawing up a manifesto entitled <span class="italic">L'Accord du peuple</span>, a hastily edited version of the English Levellers' <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, rather inappropriately applied to French conditions, as well as another text designed to appeal more specifically to the sensibilities of the Huguenots of rural Guyenne. This <span class="italic">Manifeste</span> called for land reform, religious toleration, and the establishment of godly government modelled on the puritan regime in England. This enthused some of the French rebels sufficiently to send a deputation to Westminster on an ill-fated quest for formal English assistance in their struggle with Cardinal Mazarin and the young Louis XIV. But the revolt was finally crushed in August 1653, and Sexby himself fled back to England, where he continued to sponsor Anglo&#150;Huguenot amity. It was rumoured in the following spring that he was to command a combined force of English troops and Irish levies in an invasion of Guyenne.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Sexby spent much time and energy seeking to recoup his losses in the service of the state. After a year of lobbying for the settlement of his debts, a personal appeal to Cromwell eventually obtained a protectoral ordinance for payment of &pound;1000 out of excise receipts. The betrayal of Sexby's once passionate belief in the sovereignty of the people would appear to have been complete. However, Sexby was by no means at peace with the new order in England, where the interests of protestant France were increasingly spurned in the quest for an alliance with Louis XIV. Sexby now threw in his lot with the enemies of the protectorate. Feared for his continued associations within the ranks of the army, steps were taken to arrest him in February 1655. But the party sent to apprehend him at Portland were themselves arrested by the mayor of the town and governor of the castle, on the grounds that &#145;they were attempting to deprive an Englishman of his liberty without being able to show a warrant&#146;  (Gardiner, 3.270). Sexby escaped to Flanders.<br>
<br>At Antwerp, Sexby made contact with royalists to whom he asserted that, if proper security were given for popular liberties, he would be happy to see Charles II restored. He also obtained an interview with the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Count Fuensaldanha, soliciting military and financial assistance for a rising in England. In June the count sent Sexby to Spain to make his proposals before the council of state at Madrid, and the Englishman returned in December with supplies of money and conditional promises of support. Father Peter Talbot, who acted as interpreter in Sexby's dealings with Fuensaldanha, communicated his proposals to Charles II, urging the king to come to an agreement with Spain, and to utilize Sexby and his party. A year later, Sexby was still trying to raise an insurrection in England under Spanish auspices. The royalists were to assist, but he stipulated &#145;that no mention be made of the king before such time as Cromwell be destroyed, and till then the royalists that shall take arms shall speak of nothing but the liberty of the country, according to the declaration whereof I have spoken with the king of England's ministers&#146;  (Ogle and others, 3.315). Cromwell revealed details of the plot in dramatic fashion at the opening of his second parliament. An essential component was to have been the lord protector's assassination, to which end Sexby and his fellow conspirators demonstrated remarkable ingenuity. But all their plans failed, and in January 1657 an attempt to set fire to Whitehall led to the arrest of Miles Sindercombe. A few months later, about May 1657, there arrived in England copies of an apology for tyrannicide, entitled <span class="italic">Killing Noe Murder</span>, published by Sexby in Holland, evidently with the assistance of Silius Titus, under the name of Sexby's former fellow agitator William Allen. Sexby argued that Cromwell was a tyrant on a par with Caligula and Nero. However stable, his reign was an abrogation of law which constituted the enslavement of the English people and threatened the outright corruption of English society. In such circumstances the private citizen was perfectly within his rights in seeking to exact the punishment for which responsibility ought normally to rest with God and the magistrate. Tyranny being the suspension of the normal course of law, tyrannicide could not be regarded as an act of murder. In June 1657 Sexby himself crossed back over to England to promote fresh conspiracies against the Cromwellian regime. On 24 July, as he was embarking for Flanders, dressed &#145;in a mean habit disguised as a countryman&#146;, he was arrested  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). It was during imprisonment in the Tower that he confessed his authorship of <span class="italic">Killing Noe Murder</span>, although after the Restoration it would be attributed wholly to Titus. Sick in body, and evidently in mind also, Sexby died in the Tower on 13 January 1658 and according to <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> was interred in the burial-ground near the Tower chapel two days later. He would appear to have left a wife, of whom nothing is known other than that she visited him during his incarceration.<br>
