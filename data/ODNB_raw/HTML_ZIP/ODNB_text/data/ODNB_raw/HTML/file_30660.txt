<span class="headword">Beatty, Sir  (Alfred) Chester</span>  (1875&#150;1968), <span class="occ">mining engineer and art collector</span>, was born on 7 February 1875 in New York city, the youngest of the three sons of John Cuming Beatty, banker, of New York city, and his wife, Hetty, daughter of William Gedney Bull. He was educated at Westminster School, Dobbs Ferry, New York, at Princeton University, and then at Columbia University (school of mines), where he came top in every subject except geology, in which he came second. He went to Denver, Colorado, in search of work, and rose rapidly from labourer to manager of a small gold mine. He then established himself as a reputable consultant, and in 1903 he became consulting engineer and assistant general manager of the Guggenheim Exploration Company, working alongside the renowned engineer John Hays Hammond. Together they acquired and developed many of Guggenheim's best mines, including silver mines in Mexico, and copper mines in the western states of the USA, as well as various prospecting concessions in the Belgian Congo (later Zaire).<br>
<br>On 18 April 1900 Beatty married Grace Madeline (<i>d</i>. 1911), known as Ninette, daughter of Alfred Rickard, a mining engineer of Denver, with whom he worked. They raised a daughter, Ninette (1901&#150;1958), and a son, Alfred Chester Beatty (1907&#150;1983), in New York. Ninette Beatty was taken ill in 1910, and though she recovered from an operation she died of typhoid fever on 28 March 1911. Beatty himself suffered from lung problems at this time, and afterwards sought winter sunshine. Within two weeks of the funeral, he sailed for England with his children, his brother (William) Gedney Beatty, an architect, and his servants.<br>
<br>On 21 June 1913 Beatty married the divorcee Edith Stone (<i>c</i>.1886&#150;1952), daughter of John Dunn of New York. He acquired as his London home Baroda House, Kensington Palace Gardens, which he turned over to the government for use as a military hospital during the war. In 1914 the Beattys made the first of many visits to Egypt, where he subsequently spent many winters and built himself a house, on the outskirts of Cairo.<br>
<br>Also in 1913 Beatty founded Selection Trust Ltd. This remained a small company until after the First World War, when Beatty embarked on the development, finance, and administration of mining businesses throughout the world. In this way he developed zinc and lead mines at Tetiuhe in Siberia, diamond mines on the west coast of Africa, and lead and zinc mines in Serbia. His greatest achievement, however, was the part he played in the development of the copperbelt in Northern Rhodesia (later Zambia), where he formed the great mines of Roan Antelope and Mufulira.<br>
<br>The extraordinary feature of Beatty's work in these territories is that, as far as is known, apart from Trepca, in Serbia, he never visited any of these countries. He assembled a team of expert geologists and mining engineers whom he sent to these places with very specific instructions about where they should explore. Based on his own experience and backed by his unerring flair for potential mining areas, his judgement was seldom proved wrong, and in these four territories great and successful mining enterprises were established. In the subsequent fifty years one by one these were nationalized, first in Siberia and then in Yugoslavia. The last of the nationalizations was in Zambia in 1970. In the meantime, however, Selection Trust had acquired valuable interests in other mines around the world, including in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and South-West Africa (Namibia), as well as interests in the North Sea and the UK.<br>
<br>In 1933 Beatty became a British subject and during the Second World War he gave valuable service to government departments active in his own field. During the war he became estranged from his wife. They lived apart for some ten years, until her death at Baroda House in 1952. By this time Beatty had retired, and, disliking what he considered to be the over-regulation of life in post-war England, he had moved in 1950 to Ireland, the land of his Beatty ancestors, settling at 10 Ailesbury Road, Dublin.<br>
<br>Between the time that he retired from Guggenheim and his arrival in Britain, Beatty spent much time in the Middle and Near East exploring the art treasures of that part of the world. He built up a unique collection of Indian and Persian miniatures and manuscripts and early bibles, including parts of a <span class="roman">New Testament</span> which was two centuries older than the <span class="italic">Codex Sinaiticus</span>; he also acquired the earliest known copy of the <span class="italic">Rubaiyat</span> of &#145;Umar Khayyam. Later he turned his attention to Impressionist art, in which he built up one of the most valuable private collections in the world. He also collected French and Russian gold snuff-boxes, watches from the eighteenth century, clocks, stamps, and a library of rare books which were said to number 9000 and which weighed 35 tons. On retiring to Ireland he gave more than eighty of his Impressionist pictures to the national gallery in Dublin and in 1955 he handed over to the Irish nation a thirteenth-century book of hours which had previously been on loan to the British Museum.<br>
<br>In the philanthropic field he is best known for his interest in cancer research. In the 1930s he purchased the old Freemasons' Hospital in the Fulham Road and converted it into the Chester Beatty Research Institute (later the Institute of Cancer Research: Royal Cancer Hospital).<br>
<br>Beatty was a man of great and bountiful disposition, generous to a fault, not only in his national benefactions but to individuals as well. Cast in a heroic mould, he had a Churchillian sweep and a supreme contempt of every kind of socialist bureaucracy. His endearing mannerisms included a total dislike of smoking in any room in which he was present, and a horror of draughts and cold, which was obvious from the impressive cloak which he wore, often on the warmest days.<br>
<br>In his professional life Beatty received many honours, including the gold medal of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, which he was awarded in 1935, and the Serbian <i>grand cordon</i> of the order of St Sava, which he received on the occasion of the opening of the Trepca mines. He was knighted in 1954, and he later became the first honorary citizen of the Irish republic under the <span class="roman">Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act</span> of 1956.<br>
<br>Beatty died in hospital in Monte Carlo, Monaco, on 19 January 1968, and was buried in Ireland, being given a state funeral at St Patrick's Anglican Cathedral. His estate in Ireland was valued at over &pound;7 million, his English estate being relatively insignificant. Alfred Chester Beatty junior succeeded his father as chairman of Selection Trust in 1950 and remained in office until 1978, two years before BP paid &pound;412 million for the Selection Trust shares, the most expensive takeover the City had known.<br>
