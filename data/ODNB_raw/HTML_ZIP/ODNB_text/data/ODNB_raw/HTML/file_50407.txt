<span class="headword">Bilsland, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1921), <span class="occ">bread and biscuit manufacturer</span>, was born on 17 March 1847 at Ballat, Stirlingshire, the eldest of four surviving sons of James Bilsland, a farmer, and his wife, Anne, daughter of William Blair. Educated at Dalmonach School, Bonhill, north of Dumbarton, at the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to, and then worked for, a grocer and provision merchant in Glasgow. By 1872 he had saved up enough money to set up his younger brothers, John, James, and Alexander, in bakeries, of which they had six in 1875. To help build up capital, they paid themselves very modest wages. As demand for their bread grew, in 1880 Bilsland Brothers&#151;a partnership since 1877&#151;erected a brand new bakery in Hyde Park Street. Unusually for their trade, they installed the latest machinery from Baker Perkins of Peterborough, whose links with developers of baking technology in the United States led to the purchase of an American revolving oven a few years later.<br>
<br>In 1885 Bilsland married Agnes Anne (<i>d</i>. 1935), third daughter of Alexander Steven, a Glasgow engineer. They had two sons and two daughters. The company's main product was the 2 lb white loaf, and in 1900 the factory was turning out 23,000 dozen of these loaves a week and had 200 employees. The technically trained youngest brother, John, ran the production side, which left William free to concentrate on marketing. He built up a fleet of motorized and horse-drawn vans to deliver the bread to 1600 retailers in the Glasgow district, and he created markets in nearby towns and in the western highlands and islands, sending consignments by rail. His success was due partly to his deep understanding of the grocery trade; he took a special interest in the local grocers' and provision merchants' association.<br>
<br>As the market for bread was limited, in 1890 Bilsland began to diversify by acquiring a partnership in Gray, Dunn &amp; Co. of Glasgow, biscuit makers to the queen, a firm then in a stagnant condition. He steadily built it up into one of the leading biscuit firms in Scotland. However, he did not introduce more profitable &#145;fancy lines&#146;, such as scones and cakes, into the bread factory, and he gradually lost his technical lead under intense competition. As senior partner and, from 1915 onwards, chairman of Bilsland Brothers Ltd, he was an autocrat, and the firm marked time while he became ever more immersed in outside interests.<br>
<br>A member of the city council from 1886, Bilsland was lord provost of Glasgow from 1905 to 1908. He was created a baronet in 1907, awarded an honorary LLD from Glasgow University, and made a member of several foreign orders. He was also deputy lieutenant and a JP. His ambitious plan for extending the city boundaries was achieved in 1912, and he took particular interest in promoting leisure facilities, most notably the art gallery at Kelvingrove for the middle classes and the People's Palace and Winter Gardens in the east end for the &#145;plebs&#146;. Being a lifelong abstainer, he was chairman of the Scottish departmental committee on inebriates, which reported in 1909. His directorships included that of the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1915 onwards. He set up the District Visitors' Association, actively involved himself in relief schemes during the unemployment crisis of 1908, and was chairman of the Glasgow Workmen's Dwellings Company.<br>
<br>Bilsland was a committed Liberal, and as a member of the United Free Church he sat on a committee planning reunion with the Church of Scotland, achieved in 1929. He began weekly meetings for the partners, and later for the board, with a prayer of thanks for the Lord's continuing blessing on the business, and he made regular charitable donations of &pound;1000&#150;2000 a year. Employees were considerately treated in the clean and well-ventilated factory, and relatively high wages were supplemented by cash bonuses and free bread; however, he excluded all trade unions. Bilsland remained chairman until his death, on 27 August 1921, at Gartur, Cambusbarron, Stirlingshire. The baronetcy was inherited by his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40287/', "(Alexander) Steven Bilsland, later Baron Bilsland")</script>.<br>
