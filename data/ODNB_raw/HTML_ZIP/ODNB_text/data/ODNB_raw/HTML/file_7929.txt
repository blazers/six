<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, ninth earl of Angus  (1532/3&#150;1591), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Archibald Douglas of Glenbervie and Agnes Keith, daughter of William, second Earl Marischal. In 1552 he married Egidia, daughter of Robert Graham of Morphie; they had thirteen children&#151;nine sons and four daughters. His paternal grandfather having been a son of Archibald, fifth earl of Angus, William Douglas succeeded to the earldom under an entail on 25 December 1588 following the death of Archibald, the eighth earl, on 4 August, after his right had been contested in the court of session by James VI. The king claimed the title through his grandmother Margaret, countess of Lennox, a daughter of Archibald, the sixth earl, whereas Douglas of Glenbervie based his claim on Archibald's will, drafted in 1547, and on Countess Margaret's renunciation of her claims in 1565. Although Douglas was awarded the title, under pressure from the king he had to pay James 35,000 merks and also relinquish his lands at Braidwood to the crown. James immediately conferred Braidwood on his chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane, who (perhaps significantly) was a prominent member of the court which had decided in the new earl's favour.<br>
<br>Shortly before he succeeded to the earldom, Douglas had begun to be actively involved in national affairs. In 1585, in association with Maitland, he presented a petition to the king seeking to revive the system whereby lairds attended parliament and took part in its business. In 1589 he took part in the suppression of the rising by the sixth earl of Huntly and his fellow &#145;northern earls&#146;, serving as chairman of the jury at the trial of the earl of Bothwell, a leading insurgent. Shortly afterwards he was a member of the body responsible for the government of Scotland while the king was in Scandinavia for his marriage to Anne of Denmark, and on 7 May 1590 he carried the sword at the new queen's coronation. But overall his career was uneventful, and he has been justly described as &#145;one of the most pacific of all the earls&#146;  (Lee, 222). Angus died on 1 July 1591, in his fifty-ninth year, at Glenbervie, where he was also buried. His widow was still living in 1606. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7931/', "William Douglas")</script>, succeeded as tenth earl.<br>
