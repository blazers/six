<span class="headword">Spottiswood,  James</span>  (1567&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Clogher</span>, was born at Calder in Scotland on 7 September 1567, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26166/', "John Spottiswoode (1509/10&#150;1585)")</script>, superintendent of Lothian, and his wife, Beatrix Crichton, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26167/', "John Spottiswoode (1565&#150;1639)")</script>, archbishop of St Andrews. He was educated at home with a tutor called William Strange, later minister of Kirkliston. He subsequently attended Edinburgh grammar school and a school at Linlithgow. In 1579, then aged twelve, he entered the University of Glasgow, graduating in 1583. After his father's death he entered the service of James VI in 1588, and one of his first tasks was to accompany the king to meet his future wife, Anne of Denmark. He also raised the alarm which prevented the earl of Bothwell from seizing the king in 1591. He was secretary to the ambassadors to the king of Denmark and the German princes in 1598. After the succession of James to the crown of England he was sent to John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, who persuaded him to take orders in the Church of England. He was ordained and presented by the king to the rectory of Wells, in Norfolk. He remained there until 1616, when he formed part of a visitation to the University of St Andrews with Patrick Young, dean of Winchester. There he was made DD for a thesis later published as <span class="italic">Concio J Spottiswodii &hellip; quam habuit as celrum Andreanopoli &hellip; pro gradu doctoratus</span> (1616). In the same year he also published at Edinburgh <span class="italic">The execution of Neshech and the confyning of his brother Tarbith, or, A short discourse shewing the difference betwixt damned usurie and that which is lawful: wherunto there is subjoyned an epistle of &hellip; J Calvin touching that same argument &hellip; translated out of the Latine</span>.<br>
<br>In 1620 Spottiswood became involved in a dispute in Norfolk involving admiralty rights which took him to the court in London. While there George Montgomery, bishop of Meath and Clogher, who acted as agent for the Irish church at court, died, and Spottiswood's friends persuaded him to petition the king for the bishopric. Through the influence of the duke of Buckingham this was granted. He was nominated on 20 January 1621, arrived in Dublin in April, and the mandate for his consecration was dated 22 October 1621. The delay in issuing the mandate gave rise to a dispute with James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, about his exercise of the jurisdiction of the see of Clogher.<br>
<br>By 1625 Spottiswood had become entangled in a dispute with a prominent co. Fermanagh landowner, Lord Balfour, over the right to appoint a schoolmaster to the Royal School at Enniskillen. Under the terms of the Ulster plantation scheme such rights, and the lands of the schools, had been vested in local bishops as trustees of the schools. Geoffrey Middleton, Balfour's chaplain and schoolmaster at Enniskillen, petitioned the king to grant him the school lands in fee. Spottiswood, suspecting that Balfour was attempting to seize the lands for himself, objected, and Balfour began to create a complicated network of rumour and intrigue at court against Spottiswood. The result was a fist fight between the two men and arbitrators were called in. However, a dispute over the meaning of the arbitration led to a chancery suit which was settled in 1627. More serious was the fatal wounding in 1626 of Sir John Weymss, sheriff of co. Fermanagh, by Humphry Galbraith, rector of Derrybrusk, during a raid to seize cattle distrained for non-payment of rent due on land belonging to Spottiswood. The result was a set of actions and counter-actions taken in the Dublin courts between Balfour and Spottiswood&#151;each trying to bankrupt the other by having higher and higher sureties demanded for appearance at court. In November 1627 Spottiswood was tried for his servants' actions, since the servants did not appear. The jury brought in a verdict of &#145;ignoramus&#146;, but not before Spottiswood had made accusations of witchcraft against Sir John Weymss's daughter. Balfour again tried to blacken Spottiswood's name at court in London but the king intervened, setting up a commission to determine the case. Tensions between the two men persisted in the 1630s, each taking a different side in the factional politics of co. Fermanagh. Spottiswood's own account of the disputes was published in 1811 as <span class="italic">A Breefe Memorial of the Lyfe and Death of Doctor James Spottiswood</span>, which a later hand continued into the 1630s.<br>
<br>Spottiswood spent a considerable amount of time and effort in the 1630s recovering alienated church land in the diocese of Clogher and he improved church income considerably. After the outbreak of the rising of 1641 in Ulster he fled to London, where he lived until his death at Westminster in March 1645, being buried in St Benedict's Chapel, Westminster, on 31 March 1645. He left a son, Sir Henry Spottiswood, and a daughter, Mary.<br>
