<span class="headword">Arditi,  Luigi</span>  (1822&#150;1903), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born on 16 July 1822 in Crescentino, Piedmont, the son of Maurizio Arditi and his wife, Caterina Colombo. He studied the violin with Carossini and Capitani in his home town, with Caldera in Turin, and with Alessandro Rolla at the Milan conservatory, where he also took composition lessons with Nicola Vaccai. His first opera, the one-act <span class="italic">I briganti</span>, was produced there in 1841. He left the conservatory in 1842 and first conducted opera in Vercelli in 1843, then moved to the Teatro R&egrave; in Milan (1844&#150;6). In 1846 he went to Havana and conducted at the Teatro Imperiale and the Teatro Tac&oacute;n, where he produced his one-act opera <span class="italic">Il corsaro</span> (1847); he also conducted in Canada in 1853 and the USA in 1854&#150;6, producing his <span class="italic">La spia</span> in New York in 1856. After working in Constantinople and touring Europe, he settled in London in 1858 as conductor at Her Majesty's Theatre. He remained there through the managements of Benjamin Lumley, E. T. Smith, and James Mapleson until the theatre burnt down in 1867, conducting a wide repertory, and took the company touring, especially to Dublin. He succeeded Michael Costa at Covent Garden in 1869, and also conducted seasons with the Italian Opera at St Petersburg (1871, 1873) and annual seasons in Vienna (1870&#150;78). He conducted the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts from 1874 to 1877, and in 1878 conducted in Madrid. His many other activities included regular tours of the USA with Mapleson's company (with Adelina Patti), and engagements at Her Majesty's (1880), Covent Garden (1885, 1889), and the Shaftesbury Theatre (1891). In 1891 he conducted Patti, who greatly admired him, at the opening of the theatre in her house at Craig-y-Nos on 12 August, and, with Lago's company, before Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 27 November, the first operatic performance there since the death of the prince consort. His last tour was with the Carl Rosa Company in 1894.<br>
<br>Arditi conducted twenty-three important British premi&egrave;res of operas by composers including Verdi (<span class="italic">Un ballo in maschera</span>, 1861, <span class="italic">La forza del destino</span>, 1867), Gounod (<span class="italic">Faust</span>, 1863), Wagner (<span class="italic">Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder</span>, 1870), Mascagni (<span class="italic">Cavalleria rusticana</span>, 1891), and Humperdinck (<span class="italic">H&auml;nsel und Gretel</span>, 1894), earning their friendship; he also conducted historical revivals, including Cherubini's <span class="italic">M&eacute;d&eacute;e</span> (1865) and Gluck's <span class="italic">Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</span> (1866). He married Virginia, daughter of William S. Warwick, of Richmond, Virginia, on 20 June 1856; the couple had a daughter, Giulietta (<i>b</i>. 1859), and a son, Luigi (<i>b</i>. 1866).<br>
<br>Arditi's compositions include vocal waltzes, a genre he virtually invented; among these is the once immensely popular &#145;Il bacio&#146; (1860), which Patti used to sing in the Lesson Scene in Rossini's <span class="italic">Il barbiere di Siviglia</span>. He sold this outright to the publisher Cramer for &pound;50. None of his other music, which includes orchestral works, has remained in the repertory. He was admired by musicians and audiences as a highly professional and versatile opera conductor. Bald, moustachioed, and with a small goatee, he was affectionately mocked for his piping voice and insecure command of English. His autobiography (1896) gives a vivid account of his career and of the many musicians with whom he came in contact. He died of lobar pneumonia at 14 Gwydyr Mansions, Hove, on 1 May 1903.<br>
