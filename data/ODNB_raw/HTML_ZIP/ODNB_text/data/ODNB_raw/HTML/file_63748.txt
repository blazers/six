<span class="headword">Hale <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Burke; <em>other married names </em>Peabody, McLean]</span>,  Kathleen</span>  (1887&#150;1958), <span class="occ">fund-raiser</span>, was born in London on 24 October 1887, the daughter of Thomas Francis Burke, an official of the London and North-Western Railway Company, and his wife, Georgina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Connolly. Educated in London, she passed the senior examination of the Oxford delegacy for local examinations at the age of fourteen, becoming an Oxford associate of arts, and she later studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. Kathleen Burke was in New York when the First World War broke out, but she rushed back to Britain, where she was appointed secretary to one of the first British commissions to Belgium, helping the refugees flee to Britain before the German advance. After such work was no longer possible she became a secretary in the London office of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service (SWH), the organization founded by Dr Elsie Inglis to send all-women medical units to allied armies in the field. Before spring 1915 she had never made a speech in her life, but when Dr Inglis asked the young woman to take her place as a speaker for the SWH Kathleen Burke proved to have a natural gift for inspiring her audiences to part with money for the cause she pleaded.<br>
<br>In summer 1915 Burke was invited by General P&eacute;tain to visit Verdun after it was evacuated, and she was escorted to the trenches, an experience that she wrote up as <span class="italic">The White Road to Verdun</span> (1916). On a more personal note she advised the SWH treasurer that she had been borrowed by the French Red Cross for<blockquote>a special and rather delicate mission to the French Military Authorities. I was obliged to track a French General down and when I found him we had to carry on our &#145;conversation&#146; in writing owing to the noise of the guns!!! I was lucky enough to be successful &hellip; You see I have lived half my life with French Military people and so understand the &#145;kinks&#146; in their character. (Burke file, SWH collection, Mitchell L., Glas.)</blockquote>Unfortunately there is nowhere any hint of how or why the daughter of a British railway official came to have such close connections with the French military.In December 1915 Kathleen Burke shared a platform at Winchester with a rich American woman who knew her uncle well in New York; she tried to persuade Burke to spend some months in America to help raise money for the Serbian cause. Initially, Burke wrote in confidence to the SWH treasurer, &#145;the offer was a determined attempt to steal me from my present work&#146;, but she &#145;refused to consider the scheme unless I saw a good profit coming to the Hospitals&#146;  (Burke file, SWH collection, Mitchell L., Glas.). The SWH committee agreed to her going, and she crossed the Atlantic in February 1916. By early March she had already raised about &pound;3000, and a fortnight later Andrew Carnegie gave her a further &pound;1000. The SWH committee agreed that if she raised &pound;10,000 they would send out a unit called the American unit, and in May she achieved that goal.<br>
<br>Burke's success was so great that, inevitably, she went over to North America a second time, criss-crossing the USA and Canada for months, and raising so much money that she became known as the $1000-a-day girl. At one point she looked so tired that a millionaire friend made her an offer: he would pay the SWH $500 a day for two days if she would &#145;go down to his country place and stay quietly with his daughter&#146;. Burke raised $1000 by doing nothing: &#145;I wish some of the other millionaires would follow his example&#146;, she wrote  (Burke file, SWH collection, Mitchell L., Glas.). At San Francisco, when the mayor heard that, due to some petty bureaucracy, Burke had not been allowed onto the railway station platform to collect her luggage, he had her appointed a &#145;special policeman&#146;; she said: &#145;I carry a good five pointed silver star inside my coat. It may be useful someday&#146;  (ibid.). She was given the freedom of several American cities and was appointed honorary colonel of the 138th US field artillery in recognition of her work for the American Red Cross. It was estimated that she raised about $4 million for various allied services. She was appointed CBE (1918), chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and knight of St Sava, Serbia.<br>
<br>In January 1920 Kathleen Burke was in hospital in Santa Barbara in California, USA, &#145;with a general break down&#146;; she wrote that she was &#145;threatening to marry one of the California multi-millionaires&#146;  (Burke file, SWH collection, Mitchell L., Glas.). Later that year, on 5 April, she did indeed marry company president Frederick Forrest Peabody (1859&#150;1927) of Santa Barbara. In 1929, two years after his death, she married John Reginald McLean, but he died in the same year. Her third marriage, in 1931, was to Girard van Barkaloo Hale (<i>c</i>.1884&#150;1958). Born in Denver, Mr Hale studied at the Rochester (New York) School of Art and at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. He was co-painter of a mural in the Utah State Capitol, Salt Lake City. During the First World War he was a member of the American field ambulance service, attached to the French army, when he received the Croix de Guerre and two citations.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1940 Kathleen Hale returned to France, working with relief units of the American Friends of France. In 1946 the Hales &#145;adopted&#146; the French village of Maille in Indre-et-Loire, which had been devastated in the Second World War, shipping out supplies for its 400 inhabitants, and its schools, churches, and farms. Kathleen Burke Hale died in Santa Barbara in November 1958, less than a month after her husband. Kathleen Burke's charisma, which induced her audiences to pour such vast amounts of money into allied coffers during the First World War, cannot be captured by the written word, but her warmth, charm, sense of humour, and intelligence are evident in every letter of hers preserved in the SWH collection.<br>
