<span class="headword">Magrath,  Meiler</span> <span class="st"> [Maol Mhuire Mag Craith]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1523&#150;1622), <span class="occ">archbishop of Cashel</span>, was born the eldest son of Donough &#145;Gillegrowmoe&#146; Magrath (<i>d</i>. in or after 1589), chieftain, on the borders of counties Donegal and Fermanagh. For generations the Magrath sept or clan had been erenaghs, or hereditary wardens, of Termon Magrath, an ancient ecclesiastical district in the parish of Templecarn in co. Donegal. Donough Magrath came into possession of Termon Magrath and other nearby ecclesiastical lands upon acceding to the Magrath chieftaincy some time in the mid-sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Little is known of Meiler Magrath's early years, but he became a Franciscan friar about 1540, was ordained priest in 1549, and travelled the continent for many years before arriving in Rome. On 12 October 1565 he was appointed bishop of Down and Connor by papal provision and shortly thereafter returned to Ireland. However, the see to which he was appointed had come under the control of Shane O'Neill, who was then in open rebellion against Elizabeth I. Through the Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh, Richard Creagh, whose acquaintance he may have made in Rome, Magrath dined with Shane in August 1566 and appeared ready to support the powerful chief in his struggle against the queen. Following Shane's defeat, however, Magrath surrendered himself at Drogheda, co. Louth, to the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, and expressed a willingness to renounce the pope, Pius V, and hold his bishopric of the queen.<br>
<br>The government, hoping to exploit a native bishop willing to conform, summoned Magrath to England in spring 1570 and (in the hope that his example would be followed by other Gaelic clerics) appointed him bishop of Clogher on 18 September. On 3 February 1571 he was made archbishop of Cashel and bishop of Emly, though he remained the nominal bishop of Clogher until 1605. His relocation to the more prominent see of Cashel coincided with James Fitzmaurice's rebellion. By summer 1571 Magrath had incurred the rebels' enmity following his imprisonment of several Cashel-based friars, who had allegedly preached against the queen. Undaunted, Magrath furnished the government throughout Fitzmaurice's rebellion with valuable information on rebel activity in Munster. He continued to monitor the activities of rebels during the 1570s. His unfounded accusations levelled against Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare, and Thomas Butler, eleventh earl of Ormond, in 1572, however, led Sir William Fitzwilliam, the lord deputy, to deem Magrath's writings to be &#145;but fancy rather than truth&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/37/3). However, despite Fitzwilliam's distrust, Magrath remained one of the few visible successes of a religious reform movement that had made little real progress among Gaelic clerics. His high-profile position was an embarrassment for Rome and on 14 March 1580 the pope, Gregory XIII, finally deprived him of Down and Connor, &#145;ob crimen haeresis et alia multa scelera&#146; (&#145;for the crime of heresy and many other offences&#146;), which he had held concurrently with the archbishopric of Cashel for nine years  (Brady, 1.265).<br>
<br>With letters of recommendation from the Irish privy council, Magrath travelled to England in October 1582, where he complained of the impoverished state of his archbishopric; he also delivered a letter to Elizabeth urging her to require any judge, jury, or witness in Ireland to swear an oath of allegiance to her before passing judgment on known protestants. He was well received and in November was awarded, <i>in commendam</i>, the revenue of the temporalities and spiritualities of the bishoprics of Lismore and Waterford to help offset his financial difficulties. In July 1584 Magrath petitioned to have his ancestral lands in Ulster granted to his ageing father, with remainder to his legitimate male heirs, to hold of the queen. By this time Magrath had married Anne, or &Aacute;ine, O'Meara (<i>d</i>. in or after 1622), of Lisany, co. Tipperary, with whom he had at least four sons and several daughters. For the rest of the decade Magrath, who had received a grant of English liberty in May 1578, devoted himself to the spread of protestantism and the extension of English law. In 1584 he arrested Maurice O'Brien, Roman Catholic bishop of Emly, and in March 1589 he wrote strongly in favour of the Kerry planter, Sir William Herbert: &#145;truly I think it were better for Her Majesty to have six like him in this realm to win the people's heart and good will, and to bring them into true and loyal subjection than 6,000 soldiers&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/142/17). Yet his religious devotion and loyalty were continually under suspicion. Rumours of his complicity in the rebellion of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond (between 1579 and 1583), and his alleged religious ambivalence&#151;fuelled, perhaps, by the continued adherence to Catholicism of his wife and children, and his cousin Dermod Magrath's position as Roman Catholic bishop of Cork&#151;were not easily dismissed. His accumulation of wealth, moreover, led Fitzwilliam to declare that he &#145;mislikes his greedie mynde to heape together large possessions and contentious nature always bent to quarell with such as were his neighbours&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/158/53). However, Thomas Weatherhead's nomination as bishop of Waterford and Lismore on 21 March 1589 deprived Magrath of a lucrative source of income and in 1591 he travelled to England, without licence, to seek remuneration.<br>
<br>During his absence, the rumours surrounding Magrath developed into accusations of treasons, felonies, simony, and extortion. Fitzwilliam, who had emerged as Magrath's most vocal opponent, played no small part in the opposition. Opposition, however, was not limited to English officials: Magrath's religious conversion and his acquiescence in the Tudor state had left him alienated from the Gaelic world. A poem vilifying Magrath and several other clerics who had adopted the new religion was composed by Eoghan &Oacute; Dubhtaigh: &#145;An chliar&#151;sa anois tig anall, cliar dhall ar a ndeachaidh ceo, n&iacute; m&oacute; leo Muire n&aacute; dog; dar by God, n&iacute; rachaidh leo&#146; (&#145;These clergymen who have come by the other side&#151;blind clergy enveloped in fog, respect a dog more than Mary and, by heaven, they should not get away with it&#146;; Mh&aacute;g Craith, 133). This clever usage of English terminology to satirize Magrath and his colleagues reflects the degree to which the Gaelic learned classes associated acceptance of the new religion with acceptance of English culture. However, Magrath remained popular at court and was restored to Waterford and Lismore following Weatherhead's death in 1592. In May of that year the queen commanded that he produce a tract concerning the state of Ireland with a plan for its reformation. Employing his intimate knowledge of Gaelic Ireland, Magrath wrote and delivered a book to Elizabeth, declaring the state of Ireland, with the means to increase the revenues, amend the government, and withstand Spanish practices. In a letter to Sir Robert Cecil dated June 1593, he responded to the allegations levelled against him. He claimed his enemies: &#145;have joyned hartes and handes togeather to overthrow and destroy my poore selfe well knowne to be (of that cuntrey birth) theire onlie ey sore and chiefest preventer and detecter of all their mischievous practizes and thirsted for invacon&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/170/4). Ultimately it was Fitzwilliam's recall in August 1594 that caused much of the opposition to subside.<br>
<br>Magrath was briefly taken prisoner by Conn, son of Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, early in 1599. Tyrone, eager to broaden his confederation beyond Ulster and believing Magrath's loyalty to be firmly rooted in the region, ordered his immediate release. Tyrone's rebellion, however, had upset Magrath's financial interests and in late 1599 he travelled to England to offer his advice on how best to suppress the rebellion. Magrath, who boasted &#145;although they [the rebels] mislike much of mee in matters of religion, yet they love mee naturally&#146;, believed that he could play an integral part in negotiating an end to the rebellion  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/206/24). Cecil, finding him &#145;a most turbulent spirit&#146;, declined to employ his services against Tyrone, but granted him a pension in 1600. Magrath, approaching eighty, continued to perform his ecclesiastical duties into James I's reign, although he came under criticism in February 1604 when Sir John Davies noted that he was &#145;an example of pluralities&#146;, holding &#145;in his hands four bishoprics &hellip; and three score and ten spiritual livings&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1603&#150;6</i>, 143). Magrath, in his own time, had become synonymous with ecclesiastical corruption and greed; in 1607 he was forced to relinquish his right to the revenue of Waterford and Lismore and was granted <i>in commendam</i> (though he did not come fully into their possession until 1611) the remote, and poor, bishoprics of Killala and Achonry in Connaught instead.<br>
<br>The political reorganization and plantation of Ulster that followed Tyrone's defeat in 1603 brought Magrath, who spent the preponderance of his later years on his Ulster lands, into conflict with the growing number of English-born planters arriving in Ireland. In 1609 George Montgomery, bishop of Derry, Clogher, and Raphoe, claimed patrimony of Termon Magrath, but Magrath refused to recognize the claim and successfully saw the lands granted to his son the following year. In 1611 differences arose between Magrath and Davies, who claimed possession of certain lands adjacent to Termon Magrath. Though Magrath ceased to wield any political influence in London or Dublin and stood increasingly as an obstacle to both ecclesiastical and political reform, the government found it difficult to curtail his powers. Some attempt was made to limit his influence in Cashel when in 1610 William Knight was appointed coadjutor of the bishopric. However, Knight's stay was a disaster; it became apparent that he shared Magrath's fondness for whiskey and, after appearing pixilated in public, departed in disgrace. In February 1612 the lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester, while condemning Magrath's abuses, warned Cecil (now first earl of Salisbury) &#145;not to discontent that heady Archbishop &hellip; for he is a powerful man amongst the Irish of Ulster, and able to do much hurt by underhand practices, in which he is well experienced&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1611&#150;14</i>, 241). Magrath sat in the House of Lords in the 1613 parliament and remained in possession of his bishoprics until his death on 14 November 1622, aged nearly one hundred. He was buried in his cathedral at Cashel and left a sizeable inheritance (amassed from years of widespread alienation of ecclesiastical lands) to his four living sons and four daughters. The Catholic tradition holds that Magrath was not buried at Cashel, but was reconciled to Rome and buried, in full Roman vestments, elsewhere. His cryptic epitaph lends some credibility to this belief: &#145;Hic ubi sum positus non sum, sum, non ubi non sum; sum nec in ambobus, sum sed utroque loco&#146; (&#145;Here, where I am placed, I am not, and thus the case is, I am not in both, yet am in both the places&#146;; Lowry-Corry, 107). In early 1612 the Franciscans expected his conversion and appointed a priest to receive Magrath into the church, but whether in the end he re-embraced Catholicism is of purely personal significance, as he did not disavow his marriage or relinquish the bishoprics which he held of the king.<br>
<br>For the Tudor government, Magrath's Gaelic background, coupled with his exceptional intelligence and ability to communicate fluently in English, Gaelic, and Latin, made him the perfect candidate to advance religious reform in Ireland; and, initially, he eagerly promoted the new religion and the state which he believed would eventually come to dominate Ireland. However, he underestimated the size of the task before him and his campaign against the old religion faltered. Magrath had fallen between the two worlds that he was meant to bridge, and this, together with his avarice, simony, and various other abuses, greatly damaged the protestant cause in Ireland and earned him an infamous reputation among English and Irish alike.<br>
