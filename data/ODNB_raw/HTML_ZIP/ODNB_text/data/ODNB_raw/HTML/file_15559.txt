<span class="headword">King,  Edward</span>  (1734/5&#150;1807), <span class="occ">writer and antiquary</span>, was baptized at St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, on 22 January 1735, the only son of Edward King (<i>d</i>. 1775) of Norwich, and his wife, Sarah. He was educated at Harrow School and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1752. He was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn on 18 September 1758 and was called to the bar in 1763. His uncle, a linen draper of Exeter, left him an ample fortune; nevertheless he practised for a number of years on the Norwich circuit before becoming recorder at Kings Lynn. In the course of his duties he &#145;defended a lady from a faithless lover&#146; and afterwards married her; all that is known of her is that her name was Susanna. He was elected FRS on 14 May 1767 and FSA on 3 May 1770, and became a member of the council of the Society of Antiquaries in 1774.<br>
<br>King's first publication was <span class="italic">An Essay on the English Constitution</span> (1767), a highly derivative piece of political journalism drawing heavily on Dalrymple and Hume. A number of his papers were published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> during the 1770s, including &#145;Remarks on the abbey church of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk&#146; and two papers on ancient castles. The director of the Society of Antiquaries, Richard Gough, who was responsible for the publication of <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, complained to Jeremiah Milles, the society's president, of King's vanity in insisting on seeing his own papers published. Following the death of Milles in February 1784, King was elected his successor as president of the society on the understanding that Lord De Ferrars (afterwards earl of Leicester) would assume office the following 23 April. During his short presidency King drew up a set of regulations for meetings and initiated a number of administrative reforms, including the appointment of two regular secretaries and a draughtsman, as well as making efforts to increase the revenues of the society by enforcing the collection of membership fees. When April came he sought re-election; he was, however, defeated by an overwhelming majority and was accused of underhand methods in attempting to secure his own election. His speech on quitting the society was printed in 1784, as was his letter vindicating his own conduct. His actions aroused little sympathy within the society (most of whom could see the advantage of having a peer of the realm as president) and prompted Samuel Pegge to comment that &#145;Edwd. King is a troublesome man, &amp; the Society will do full as well without his Company at their meetings as with it&#146;  (letter, 16 Aug 1784, minute books of the Society of Antiquaries). Although he did not contribute any further papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> his name appears in the record of council meetings during 1785&#150;6.<br>
<br>This rift with the society did not herald the end of King's antiquarian interests. A paper, &#145;Vestiges of Oxford Castle&#146;, was published in 1796, anticipating the publication of his much larger study on the same subject: <span class="italic">Munimenta antiqua, or, Observations on ancient castles, including remarks on the &hellip; progress of architecture &hellip; in Great Britain, and on the &hellip; change in &hellip; laws and customs</span>, 4 vols. (1799&#150;1806). The book is typical of King's somewhat idiosyncratic approach to antiquarian studies but nevertheless makes a strong case for architectural history and the close analysis of form and style (if less successfully effected). King argued that antiquarianism was a science and that antiquarian research should therefore be conducted in accordance with scientific models of measurement and comparison rather than being concerned with picturesque views. Though many of his contemporaries were contemptuous of his &#145;foolish theories&#146; (the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> was particularly critical of his obsession with concealed entrances and secret passages) his work was widely cited, and influenced, for example, George Chalmer's <span class="italic">Caledonia</span> (1810); the plans and plates are generally recognized to have had some lasting value. Louis Dutens disputed King's theories on the invention of the arch, and King responded in a typically vigorous fashion in the final volume of <span class="italic">Munimenta antiqua</span>, in 1806. The controversy was not ended until King's death, in the following year. King also displayed his scientific learning in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the clouds, both in these days and in antient times</span> (1796), which was prompted by a shower of stones that had supposedly fallen in Tuscany in the previous year and been investigated by Abbate Soldani, professor of mathematics at the University of Siena.<br>
<br>King's interests had always been eclectic and he published on a number of other subjects in addition to that of antiquity. In 1785 he circulated anonymously <span class="italic">Proposals for Establishing at Sea a Marine School, or Seminary for Seamen</span>, which pointed out objections to Jonas Hanway's proposals for a large marine school on land and suggested fitting up a man-of-war instead. Hanway responded with <span class="italic">Observations on a Proposal</span> (1785). King's <span class="italic">Considerations on the utility of the national debt: and on the present alarming crisis; with a short plan of a mode or relief</span> was published in 1793; he challenged the widespread anxiety surrounding the inexorable increase of the national debt and argued that rather than being a cause for concern its size should be positively welcomed as an indication of the country's prosperity; furthermore he suggested that the debt should be increased to maximize the amount of wealth in circulation. His pamphlet drew only one response, from Joseph Acland.<br>
<br>King's antiquarian publications had always had a strong providentialist streak but towards the end of his life his theological and mystical interests became increasingly prominent. His theology represents an interesting mixture of eschatology, virulent anti-Catholicism, and a vigorous assertion of the compatibility of scientific truth with revealed religion. In 1788 his <span class="italic">Morsels of Criticism</span> attempted to show that John the Baptist was an angel from heaven who had formerly appeared in the person of Elijah, and that there would be a second appearance of Christ upon earth. In the same publication he also argued that the earth was a kind of comet on a trajectory towards the sun, by which it would eventually be ignited, while at its centre the earth consisted of a bottomless pit in which the wicked were punished. Though King received sixty copies for personal distribution there was little demand for the remaining texts; a few years later it was mentioned in Mathias's <span class="italic">The Pursuits of Literature</span> and as a result was reissued, in 1800, with &#145;a supplemental part designed to show, still more fully, the perfect consistency of philosophical discoveries, and of historical facts, with the revealed Will of God&#146;.<br>
<br>The popular success of <span class="italic">Morsels of Criticism</span> did nothing to enhance King's reputation as a philosophical commentator on the scriptures, however. In 1793 he had published &#145;An imitation of the prayer of Abel&#146;; a rather more extraordinary pamphlet, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Signs of the Times</span>, was published in 1798, in which he claimed that the second coming was imminent, in fulfilment of the prophecy of the second book of <span class="roman">Esdras</span>, whose questionable authenticity he vigorously upheld. He also tried to trace the history and progress of the French Revolution to the scriptures. Irritated by Richard Gough's critique in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 68/2, 591&#150;3), he wrote a violent letter to the printer, John Nichols. King added a &#145;Supplement&#146; in 1799 but this was demolished by Bishop Horsley in the same periodical in his &#145;Critical disquisitions on the eighteenth chapter of Isaiah, in a letter to E. King&#146;. King's next (anonymous) publication was <span class="italic">Honest Apprehensions, or, The Unbiassed &hellip; Confession of Faith of Plain Honest Lay-Man</span>, which contained an orthodox statement of Trinitarian theology.<br>
<br>King prided himself on the breadth of his reading and his learning, was exceedingly tenacious of his opinions, impervious to criticism, and very defensive of his views. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described him as a considerable eccentric, but pious and well-meaning. Little is known of his wife, Susanna; her niece Miss Ann Copson, described as &#145;an accomplished young lady with a large fortune&#146;, completed a number of the drawings for <span class="italic">Munimenta antiqua</span> and married Henry Windsor, younger brother to the earl of Plymouth, from King's house in Beckenham, Kent  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 71/1, 390).<br>
<br>King died at his home in Mansfield Street, London, on 16 April 1807, aged seventy-two, and was buried in the churchyard at Beckenham, near to his country seat, The Oakery, on Clay Hill. He was survived by his wife. His extensive collection of prints and drawings was sold by auction in 1808.<br>
