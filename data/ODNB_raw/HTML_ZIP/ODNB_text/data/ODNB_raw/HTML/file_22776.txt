<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prichard,  James Cowles</span>  (1786&#150;1848), <span class="occ">physician and ethnologist</span>, was born on 11 February 1786 in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, the eldest child of Thomas Prichard (1765&#150;1843), a businessman in the iron trade whose ancestors had emigrated from Ireland in 1688, and his wife, Mary Lewis (1763&#150;1794), whose forebears Prichard assumed to be of Welsh descent. Prichard's second Christian name was the family name of his father's mother.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlyeducation"></a>Family background and early education</h2>His parents belonged to well-established Herefordshire Quaker families. He had a very wealthy great-uncle. One of Prichard's two sisters died shortly after birth in 1793; the other married a certain Robert Moline. His brother Thomas, born in 1787, emigrated to America, where the family had commercial connections in New York. The youngest son, Edward (1789&#150;1822), became a banker in Ross-on-Wye. Until 1800 Prichard's father kept two houses, one in Ross-on-Wye and one in Park Street, Bristol. He had inherited part of a local iron trade business which brought him into close connection with the influential Harford family of Bristol. In 1793 James Cowles attended Richard Durham's school on College Green, Bristol, as a day scholar. Afterwards his education was entirely private, with an emphasis on languages. According to an apocryphal anecdote, as an eight-year-old he delighted a Greek sailor at Bristol harbour by addressing him in modern Greek. In 1800 Thomas Prichard returned to Ross-on-Wye where he remained until his death on 21 August 1843.<h2>
<a name="Choosesacareerinmedicine"></a>Chooses a career in medicine</h2>Despite the religiously motivated reservations of his father, Prichard chose to study medicine. In 1802 he was placed with a Bristol man specializing in anatomical preparations, named Pole; this stay was followed by a period of study of medical pharmacy under the Quaker William Tothill and his partner, Robert Pope, at Staines. In September 1804 Prichard moved to London to study anatomy at the school attached to St Thomas's Hospital, and in 1805 he went to Edinburgh University where he took his MD degree in 1808. Motivated not least by the lectures of Dugald Stewart and thanks to an early fascination with anthropology, he chose the varieties of mankind as the subject of his MD dissertation which, in 1813, appeared in an extended, Anglicized version. Prichard's education was completed by a few terms at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1809, and, in 1810, short stays at St John's College and Trinity College in Oxford. In the latter year he converted to the Church of England, in part to be able to enter Oxford, and in part, according to his friend, the Quaker Thomas Hodgkin, &#145;on the grounds of conviction&#146;  (Hodgkin, &#145;Biographical notice&#146;, 553). Still, Prichard was exceedingly devout, his faith falling in with contemporary evangelicalism which also influenced his scholarship. In 1810 he took up residence in Bristol in Berkeley Street, set up in private practice and, in 1811, became a physician to St Peter's Hospital, a combined poorhouse and lunatic asylum which he attended until 1832. When, in 1815, a French invasion seemed imminent, Prichard joined a defence corps, priding himself on being &#145;a tolerable good Match for a Frenchman&#146;  (Prichard, letter to J. R. Hale). In 1816, at his third attempt, he was elected to the Bristol Infirmary where he was to serve as physician until 1843.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandrespectability"></a>Marriage and respectability</h2>On 28 February 1811 Prichard married Anna Maria Estlin, the daughter of the Unitarian minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8897/', "John Prior Estlin (1747&#150;1817)")</script> and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8896/', "John Bishop Estlin (1785&#150;1855)")</script>, Prichard's student friend in Edinburgh. They had ten children of whom two died in infancy and three others predeceased Prichard. Augustin (1818&#150;1898), the second son, took over his father's Bristol practice. Among the others were James Cowles (<i>b</i>. 1818) and Constantine Estlin (<i>b</i>. 1820), both of whom were ministers, Albert Hermann (<i>b</i>. 1831), a postmaster, and Iltudus (<i>b</i>. 1825), a soldier in the Bengal army who published <span class="italic">The Mutinies in Rajpootana</span>. From 1816 the family lived in a house on College Green, Bristol, then in another house in Berkeley Street until, in 1827, they rented the spacious Red Lodge in Park Row. When, in 1837, the Red Lodge was for sale, Prichard bought it at auction for &pound;1800. From the last male member of the Cowles family he also inherited a summer residence in the countryside (its value is not known).<br>
<br>Apart from his medical duties, Prichard took part in the activities of several clubs and societies, figuring prominently in the Bristol Institution for the Advancement of Science, set up in 1822. In 1829 he was one of the leading spirits behind the plan to found a college for classical and scientific education designed to admit religious dissenters. Otherwise his political views, as well as his medicine, were decidedly conservative. He was an adherent of heroic treatment and counter-irritation, including blood letting (which he also practised on himself as a cure for headaches) and trepanning, nicknamed the &#145;tomahawk practice&#146;. A frightened patient was driven to poetry:<blockquote>
<div>Dr. Prichard do appear.<br>
</div>
<div>With his attendance &amp; his care,<br>
</div>
<div>He fills his patients full of sorrow<br>
</div>
<div>&#151;You must be bled to day &amp; cupped tomorrow.<br>
</div> (Smith, 512)</blockquote>From 1826 to 1828 Prichard acted as a medical visitor to Gloucestershire madhouses, an experience which he used for his publications on insanity. In 1827 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1835 he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. As Prichard's fame grew he became a respected member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), though his efforts to have ethnology accepted as an independent section in the BAAS succeeded only partially in 1846 when the subject was made a sub-section. In 1845 Prichard moved to London to take up a well-paid post under Lord Shaftesbury on the lunacy commission&#151;a task for which he had commended himself with his book on legal aspects of mental disorder: <span class="italic">On the Different Forms of Insanity, in Relation to Jurisprudence</span> (1842).<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>The Reverend William Daniel Conybeare and Francis Newman, as well as the Quaker physicians Thomas Hodgkin and Thomas Hancock were part of Prichard's circle. But his tight schedule and what he called his &#145;scribbling habit&#146;  (Prichard, letter to Hodgkin) did not leave him much time for informal socializing. Despite his keen ethnological interest he travelled little abroad, apart from a few trips to France, Germany, and Switzerland. Prichard was rather bookish. According to a student at the Bristol Infirmary, &#145;he generally wore a large, loose overcoat, with roomy side-pockets, large enough to hold a quarto or small folio case-book; and he generally carried other books with him on the seat of his carriage&#146;  (Alford, 176). Despite his frequent appearance as the chairman of committees, he was a shy and reserved man who was deemed &#145;too quiet&#146; to be made president of the Bristol meeting of the BAAS in 1836. He was universally praised as &#145;the scholar, the gentleman, and the Christian&#146;, though it did not escape his contemporaries that the wide range of his learning had its limits. His medical colleague, John Addington Symonds (1807&#150;1871) held that:<blockquote>Fancy and imagination were not prominent faculties in Dr. Prichard. &hellip; I think that he had no decided aesthetical tendency, no such sensibility to the beautiful as would lead him to dwell on the enjoyments of poetry and the fine arts. (Symonds, 48)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Ideas"></a>Ideas</h2>Prichard's various intellectual occupations converge, being all aspects of the science of mankind and the mind. He owed his fame to his ethnological endeavours. Starting with his MD dissertation, <span class="italic">Disputatio inauguralis de generis humani varietate</span> (1808), he spent his life rewriting the same book some five times. <span class="italic">Researches into the Physical History of Man</span> was published in 1813; the second edition, <span class="italic">Researches into the Physical History of Mankind</span>, appeared in two volumes (1826), and the third in five volumes (1836&#150;47), as well as in a German translation: <span class="italic">Naturgeschichte des Menschengeschlechts</span> (trans. R. Wagner and J. G. F. Will, 4 vols., 1840&#150;48). In 1843 he published a more popular and more biologically oriented version, <span class="italic">The Natural History of Man</span>, which went through four editions and appeared also in French: <span class="italic">Histoire naturelle du genre humain</span> (trans. F. Roulin, 1843). Starting from an attempt to refute Lord Kames's polygenism, Prichard's main ethnological aim was to prove the unity of mankind and to vindicate the veracity of the anthropology laid down in <span class="roman">Genesis</span>. For this purpose he grappled with problems from all the natural and human sciences: anatomy, physiology, biology, ethnology, palaeontology, archaeology, mythology, and philology. He perceived that traditional accounts of difference in skin colour were flawed: eighteenth-century environmentalism was empirically false. Prichard particularly disdained the notion, put forward by J. B. Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin, that acquired characteristics could become hereditary. To him this seemed to defy the order of creation. Without departing from the notion that external circumstances influenced physiognomy, he offered a new theory of heredity: only those characteristics could be passed on to the offspring that were &#145;connate&#146;, hence his unusual assertion that &#145;the primitive stock of men were Negroes&#146;  (Prichard, <span class="italic">Researches</span>, 1st edn, 25, 233) who gradually turned white once the process of civilization set in, instilling a better taste in individuals which made them prefer light-skinned spouses over darker ones. Latterly, this argument has been taken for an early form of Darwin's theory of sexual selection. Prichard never came to terms with the question how external influences could engender connate traits. While in the third edition of the <span class="italic">Researches</span> he did not return to his argument concerning heredity, he still believed, on the one hand, that sudden variations that had sprung up in one individual might over time become characteristics of the entire population, and, on the other, that cultural customs and living standards determined human physiognomy.<br>
<br>Thanks to his great command of literature&#151;in the late 1810s he even learned German&#151;by the 1830s Prichard was appreciated as the main authority on ethnological and anthropological matters. Endeavouring to prove monogenism, he divided the problem into two propositions: he argued first that all mankind belonged to one species: second, that all human varieties were referable to one single place of origin. The first part of the thesis rested on three arguments: that the &#145;principal Laws of the Animal Economy&#146; worked uniformly in all human tribes; that all mankind was prone to the same diseases; and that G. L. L. Buffon's criterion of hybridity was valid, that is to say that all those individuals belonged to one species who could engender fertile offspring. To prove the second part of his theory Prichard drew upon a welter of learning. He engaged in bio-geography, arguing that not only mankind but each species came from its own particular centre of creation. Then he ventured into philology to show that all human languages were related, whence he inferred genealogical relationships among human tribes. Finally, he asserted that the myths of all human cultures were so similar that they all necessarily had to share the same primeval history. Prichard had already made this point, concerning Egyptian mythology, in <span class="italic">An Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology, to which is Subjoined a Critical Examination of the Remains of Egyptian Chronology</span> (1819).<br>
<br>In his philological studies Prichard was one of the very first British scholars to take up the latest methods of comparative historical linguistics from such German scholars as Friedrich Schlegel, Franz Bopp, Jacob Grimm, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Using their historical comparative approach for his own pious ends, he endeavoured to show in his <span class="italic">The Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations Proved by a Comparison of their Dialects with the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Teutonic Languages</span> (1831) that Celtic was the connecting link between the ancient Sanskrit and Hebrew. While not every critic endorsed this fanciful theory, Prichard's other claim, namely, that Celtic was part of the Indo-European language family, was later corroborated independently by continental scholars.<br>
<br>While he always maintained the accuracy of scripture, Prichard never accepted an absolutely literal reading of it. His views adapted smoothly to new findings, since they were so multifarious and eclectic, sometimes collapsing into paradox. Thus he maintained in 1826 that environmental stimuli exerted an effect on physiognomy, while at the same time he rejected the idea that acquired characteristics could become heritable. As he abhorred polygenism he also was a great opponent of racial theories. This attitude was fuelled by his sympathetic attitude towards foreign tribes, many of whom he saw threatened with extinction by European recklessness and an acquisitive selfishness which Prichard called utilitarian: &#145;It is only by christian nations&#146;, he wrote in 1830, &#145;that such a work of total extermination has ever been thoroughly accomplished&#146;  (Prichard, &#145;Horae Africanae&#146;, 738). And as his more secular-minded scientific peers grew intrigued by racial theories, Prichard employed all his knowledge to prove them wrong.<br>
<br>In the third edition of the <span class="italic">Researches</span>, Prichard emphasized the psychological unity of mankind: common fears of retribution after death and the desire to seek atonement seemed to characterize all human cultures. This evangelical streak of his thought also surfaced in his theory of insanity. Influenced by J. E. D. Esquirol and German somaticists, he developed a new pathological category: moral insanity. Stripped of its religious and anthropological undertones it was to survive until the twentieth century. In <span class="italic">A Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System</span> (1822) Prichard toyed with the idea that there might be a mental disease in which &#145;the active powers are primarily disordered, without any affection of the intellectual faculties&#146;  (p. 135). But it was only from the 1830s that he was prepared to shed the Lockian definition of madness and envisage a type of insanity that left the rational faculties unaffected, expressing itself simply in a distortion of the emotive faculties  (&#145;Insanity&#146;, <span class="italic">The Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span>, ed. J. Forbes, A. Tweedie, and J. Conolly, 2, 1833, 10&#150;32, 847&#150;75). This notion was further deepened in his comprehensive overview of the state of knowledge concerning mental disorders in <span class="italic">A Treatise on Insanity, and other Disorders Affecting the Mind</span> (1835).<br>
<br>The pathology of moral insanity Prichard derived from his experiences as a visiting alienist. As the concept stipulated the perversion of the moral, that is, the non-intellectual, faculties, it was rooted in Scottish common-sense philosophy. Unconventional theories such as Philippe Pinel's <i>manie sans d&eacute;lire</i> and Esquirol's notion of monomania had paved the way for a departure from received wisdom. Prichard strove to account for insanity in a way that would explain various bodily symptoms, while not infringing on the notion of the inviolable soul. If he was gradually driven towards a somaticist notion of madness, which focused on the entire body rather than the brain alone, this was due to his vehement hostility towards phrenological theory which he, with many others, suspected of attempting to reduce the mind to the cerebral structure. His alternative view of insanity was inspired by a group of German somaticists who contributed to the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Anthropologie</span>, and by the theological ideas of his Quaker friend Thomas Hancock whose theory of an inbred moral sense liable to distortions spelt out the connection between the superior realm and the mundane sphere. Prichard envisaged moral insanity as both a distortion of the emotive faculties and a sign of moral perversion. Yet he was not enough of a religious, or a medical, zealot to believe that the source of corruption could be rooted out. Although he embraced contemporary notions that civilization, commercial worries, and an uprooted lifestyle left their mark on the mind, he none the less believed that the inclination to mental disease was part of the make-up of human nature, common to primitive peoples and refined men alike. Moral insanity became a widely used category, valid well into the twentieth century. But most doctors who adopted it ignored its complex, more or less implicit theological underpinnings. Medical phrenologists appropriated it for their own purposes. Later on, it became linked to notions of the pathological personality.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Prichard fell ill in December 1848. He died of pericarditis in the night of 22&#150;3 December 1848 at his house, 1 Woburn Place, Russell Square, London, and was buried on 30 December in Sellack, Herefordshire, by his son-in-law, William Henry Ley, the local vicar. By the time of his death many perceived that Prichard's anthropological views were tied up too closely with religion. While alienists with a predilection for phrenology took up his nosological category of moral insanity for their own purposes, adherents of racial theory thought that his short time-scale, that left only a few thousand years for the development of mankind, was flawed. His <span class="italic">Researches</span> remained highly esteemed as a compendium of ethnological detail, yet not for its theoretical frameworks. Prichard became considered as the representative of a bygone age. With the popularization of evolutionism E. B. Tylor thought that his discussion of the races of man as varieties of a single species was rehabilitated. Some historians of anthropology later mistook Prichard for a precursor of Darwin. In fact, his merits lay in his understanding of the problems inherent to eighteenth-century theories of man, in his readiness to grapple with evidence that seemed to contradict his theories, and in his early appreciation of scientific developments on the continent, especially in the fields of linguistics and psychiatry.<br>
