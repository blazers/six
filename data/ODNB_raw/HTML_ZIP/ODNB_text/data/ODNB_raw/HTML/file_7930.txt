<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, sixth earl of Morton  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1606), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven (killed at the battle of Pinkie in 1547) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73794/', "Lady Margaret Erskine")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69935/', "James V, mistresses and children of")</script>], daughter of John, fifth Lord Erskine. His parents, who were married in 1527, had two other sons, Robert (earl of Buchan in right of his wife, Christian Stewart) and George, and three daughters, Euphemia, Janet, and Katherine. In 1531 Margaret Erskine bore a son to James V, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26479/', "Lord James Stewart (1531/2&#150;1570)")</script>, later earl of Moray and regent of Scotland, a half-brother whom William Douglas thus shared with Mary, queen of Scots. William spent some time in France during his minority after his father's death, when his mother managed his affairs. His &#145;Memoir&#146;, an extended testament-cum-memoir written by him in 1568 during an illness, throws light on his participation in and attitude to the events of the 1550s and 1560s  (Morton muniments, GD 150/2234). In the 1550s he identified with the movement for religious reform and developed an admiration for some of its leaders, including both his half-brother James and John Knox, whose preaching impressed him during the reformer's visit to Scotland in 1555&#150;6. His marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70475/', "Lady Agnes Leslie")</script>, eldest daughter of George, fourth earl of Rothes (contract 19 August 1545, revised 1554), strengthened his association with the protestant party; the Leslies were ringleaders in the assassination of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546.<br>
<br>In 1559&#150;60 Douglas joined the army of the protestant lords of the congregation in their military confrontation with the French-backed forces of the regent, Mary of Guise, which resulted in the withdrawal of the French from Scotland and the treaty of Edinburgh between France and Scotland's new ally, England. Only the prospect of victory for protestantism, he admitted, enabled him to accept Scotland's political alignment with England, the former enemy:<blockquote>quhilk wes a begynning of the reconciliatioun amang us, and that the hairtis of thaim quhilkis wer in malice aganis thaim [the English] throw want of thair predecessouris in battaill wes begun to be slokinit [quenched] as I knaw be experience in my selff for the want of my fader at the feild of Pinky, quhilk wes the first occasioun that I did remit the sam with my hairt. (Douglas, fol. 14<i>r</i>)</blockquote>He was present at the parliament of August 1560 which confirmed the reformation settlement.<br>
<br>In Mary's personal reign (1561&#150;7) Douglas was a staunch supporter of the protestant establishment. During the brief uprising of 1565 against the queen's marriage to Henry, Lord Darnley, known as the chaseabout raid, Douglas was commanded to hand over Lochleven Castle, with the munitions stored there by Moray, one of the leaders, but he was allowed to retain it on a plea of illness and on promising to surrender it on twenty-four hours' notice if required. He shared the resentment of others towards the queen's Italian secretary, David Riccio, whose growing influence, they claimed, prevented their direct access to the queen. Douglas himself says that he approached Riccio with an offer of &pound;1000 if the secretary would &#145;stay the earl of Moray's forfaltour&#146; for his part in the chaseabout raid, &#145;bot his answer wes twenty thowsand&#146;  (Douglas, fol. 20<i>v</i>). He was denounced as one of those implicated in the murder of Riccio on 9 March 1566, although he maintained that he never intended that the secretary should be dealt with other than by process of law. After the event he retired to Argyll &#145;ane whill in quiet maner&#146;  (ibid.). He rejoiced at the birth of Prince James on 19 June 1566 and thereafter kept a watchful eye on the prince's interests in the light of his parents' estrangement and the queen's growing attachment to the earl of Bothwell, whom Douglas believed had &#145;crually put doun his [the prince's] fader in ane maist abominabill maner in Edinburt&#146;  (ibid., fol. 21<i>r</i>) in February 1567. He was gratified when the prince was placed in the guardianship of his own uncle and his wife, the earl and countess of Mar, in Stirling Castle. He was periodically associated with Mar in his keepership of that castle.<br>
<br>After Mary's marriage to Bothwell in May 1567 Douglas joined the confederate lords who pledged themselves to protect the prince and avenge his father's murder. He was far from happy, however, when after the queen's surrender to the lords at Carberry in June 1567 they chose to detain her in his own castle of Lochleven, where on 24 July she was compelled to demit the crown. Four days later Douglas formally protested that her demission had taken place in his absence, &#145;in respect thereof [he] protestit that her majestie suld not be comptit heirefter as captive or in prisoun with hym. Quhilk her majestie allowit and admittit&#146;  (Thomson, Macdonald, and Innes, 1.26&#150;7). &#145;I desirit&#146;, he recorded, &#145;that [the] nobilitie wald haiff relevit me off my burden, quhilk I culd nott get&#146;  (Douglas, fol. 22<i>r</i>). During her ten-month stay at Lochleven Mary maintained friendly relations with Douglas and members of his family, including his wife and his mother, and with his brother George and a young orphaned relative, who between them contrived her escape on 2 May 1568. He himself was never charged with failure of his trust as custodian. At the battle of Langside, near Glasgow, on 13 May 1568 Douglas led the rearguard of the king's forces and he later accompanied Moray to York for the investigation into the so-called Casket Letters, which allegedly incriminated Mary in Darnley's murder. On the collapse of the northern rising in 1569 the earl of Northumberland took refuge in Scotland, only to be imprisoned at Lochleven. His extradition to England to stand trial on a charge of treason was delayed while Douglas haggled with the English government for substantial remuneration; they eventually guaranteed him &pound;2000.<br>
<br>On the assassination of Moray in January 1570 Douglas and his brother Robert, as the regent's nearest of kin, called for the summary execution of the killer, James Hamilton of Bothwelhaugh, and in 1575, when Lord John Hamilton was reported to be intending to bring the murderer home, Douglas raised 1200 men to confront them. As a result of his attack on Lord John Hamilton while he was travelling through Fife both Douglas and Hamilton were called before the privy council to give assurances for their good behaviour. Douglas also quarrelled with Lord Ruthven over the earldom of Buchan, of which he had received a crown gift of ward on his brother Robert's death in 1580, a gift contested by Ruthven. William was closely associated with his cousin James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, who became regent in 1572, although Morton reprimanded him for his vendetta against the Hamiltons, which threatened to wreck the regent's attempts at reconciliation with potential opponents. When Morton lost the regency in 1578, he went to his cousin's castle of Lochleven, where Douglas kept him informed of political movements that might help Morton to recover power; in 1580 Douglas co-operated with his kinsman the earl of Mar in a final attempt to build up support for Morton. Douglas served as a commissioner for musters in 1574, commissioner for the laws in 1578, when he also took part in musters for the pacification of the borders, and was sheriff principal of Banff in 1584. He was knighted before 1581.<br>
<br>After Morton's arrest in 1580 on a charge of complicity in Darnley's murder Douglas with others of the regent's party was summoned before the privy council to answer questions, and was ordered to ward himself in the north on penalty of &pound;10,000. His son participated in the attempt of the so-called Ruthven raiders on 22 August 1582 to remove King James from the influence of Esm&eacute; Stewart, first duke of Lennox. Douglas, released from detention on security of &pound;20,000, but still suspected of alliance with the ultra-protestant Ruthven raiders, went into exile in France. From there he co-operated with those in Scotland who plotted the downfall of the earl of Arran in October 1585, and he returned to Scotland in 1586. In 1587 he was made a commissioner for executing acts against the Jesuits. In 1588, on the death of Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus, who had acquired the earldom of Morton in 1585 following the revocation of a grant of the title made to Lord Maxwell in 1581, William Douglas succeeded as earl under the will of the former regent Morton. Strictly speaking this made him sixth earl of Morton, but the continued claim of Lord Maxwell caused personal animosity between the two men. In 1592 Maxwell's title was revived, with the ambiguous proviso that this should in no way prejudice Douglas's rights; the claimants came to blows over precedence in 1593. Eventually in 1620 the tenth Lord Maxwell was made earl of Nithsdale.<br>
<br>Douglas's &#145;Memoir&#146; and surviving letters give the impression of a serious, almost introspective personality. For much of his life he suffered from recurrent bouts of illness, which required a constant supply of medicines, the services of a nurse, and the use of a litter when travelling around his estates, which after he became earl of Morton in 1588 were scattered over ten sheriffdoms, from Angus (Forfarshire) in the north-east to Roxburghshire in the borders. His wife, Agnes, with whom he enjoyed a married life of over fifty years, survived him. She played an active part in the running of these estates, going regularly to Auchterhouse in Angus for that purpose, from where she wrote to her husband about her activities. They had four sons, all of whom predeceased their father, and seven daughters. The earl died on 27 September 1606 and was succeeded in the earldom and estates by his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7933/', "William Douglas (1582&#150;1648)")</script>.<br>
