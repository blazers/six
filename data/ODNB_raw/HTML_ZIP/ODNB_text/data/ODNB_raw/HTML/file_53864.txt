<span class="headword">Bateman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Neden, Needham]</span>,  Hester</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">silversmith</span>, was baptized on 7 October 1708 at St Michael-le-Querne, Paternoster Row, in the City of London, the daughter of John Neden or Needham. Little is known of her early life, but as she was unable to sign her name it must be assumed that any education she received was rudimentary. She was living in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, at the time of her marriage on 20 May 1732 to John Bateman (1704&#150;1760), wiredrawer and gold chain maker, of St Bartholomew-the-Less. They had five children, Letitia (<i>b</i>. 1733), Ann (<i>b</i>. 1736), Peter (<i>b</i>. 1740), John, and Jonathan (1747&#150;1791).<br>
<br>It is reasonable to assume that Hester Bateman may have been involved with the business for some time before her husband died of consumption in 1760. In his will Bateman left his tools to his wife, which suggests that he expected her to continue the business. As a wiredrawer and gold chain maker he had not needed to register a mark at Goldsmiths' Hall. It is significant that Hester Bateman should have done so after her husband's death: by registering her first mark in April 1761 she signalled to the silversmithing trade that she intended to continue her husband's work.<br>
<br>Although by then in her early fifties Hester Bateman began building on the established business with the help of her workmen and apprentices, and her sons Jonathan and Peter, who were both apprenticed to their sister Letitia's husband, Richard Clarke. Given the understanding that we now possess of the complex organization of the gold and silver trades it cannot be assumed that she made the silver that bears her mark. Any manufacturing silversmith of the time relied upon a system of in-house specialists and outworkers to complete the product successfully. What is more certain is that Hester Bateman was the driving force behind the enterprise. She gradually expanded the range of goods and the quantity to supply a largely middle-class market using the latest, most cost-efficient manufacturing processes. The firm's deliberate use of new ideas and technology allowed it to compete with the cheap silver and Sheffield plate from Birmingham and Sheffield. Hester Bateman must be credited with the energy and foresight to pursue this strategy which enabled her to turn a small family business into one of the most successful medium-sized manufactories of its day. Her son Jonathan was a liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1784 when his own son Jonathan was apprenticed to him. Peter Bateman worked with his sister Ann after his elder brother's death.<br>
<br>The type of products produced in the earliest years of Hester Bateman's business were small silver articles such as spoons, wine labels, buttons, and seals. On registering her third (1774), fifth (1776), sixth (1778), and seventh (1781) marks she called herself a spoon maker although as early as 1774 she had used the more general title of plateworker. Surviving examples of her workshops' production before the late 1770s are comparatively rare and it has been suggested that she was supplying other goldsmiths who marked the silver as their own before sale. Pieces stamped for Hester Bateman from the last two decades of the century are much more common, which suggests increasing output and range of product.<br>
<br>Largely in the neo-classical style, the silver is almost exclusively for domestic use and includes coffee pots, tea urns, cruets, teapots, and salvers among the larger items, along with the smaller objects such as snuffer trays, goblets, salts, mustards, and sugar tongs. At its best the workmanship combined simple manufacturing and decorating techniques to form an elegant if repetitious effect. It used easily worked sheet silver and a repertoire of bright-cut, pierced, or beaded ornament that could be repeated or recombined in unlimited variations. The Bateman style was not high fashion but it was fashionable. In particular, the middle class appreciated the cost-effectiveness of using thin-gauge metal and less time-consuming manufacturing methods.<br>
<br>Hester Bateman retired when John and Peter entered their mark in 1790. At the time of her death on 16 September 1794, she was living in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn. She was buried at St Luke's, Old Street, on 26 September. The firm continued to invest in new technology to increase the competitive pricing of its own production. A flatting mill for the working of sheet metal was introduced in 1791, enabling the Batemans to dispense with the need to buy in sheet and perhaps recoup their investment by supplying other workshops. A steam engine to power the manufacturing processes had been added by 1802, ten years ahead of the most prestigious business of the time, Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell, the royal goldsmiths. The willingness to exploit the latest technology to produce good quality silver of a standardized design, which had been the foundation of Hester Bateman's success, ensured the survival of the firm into the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
