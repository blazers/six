<span class="headword">Ashfield,  Edmund</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1669&#150;<em>c.</em>1680), <span class="occ">pastellist</span>, is known principally on the basis of a marginal note in the manuscript treatise &#145;Miniatura, or, The art of limning&#146;, by Edward Norgate (1581&#150;1650): &#145;On Crayons&#146;, &#145;Mr Ashfield at red ball in Lincoln Inn field in Holben row, the first house: master of this art&#146; (Collins Baker, 83; the transcription is slightly different in Norgate, 229). Vertue, <i>c</i>.1713&#150;21, saw &#145;a Crayon head of Sr John Bennet Ld Ossulton done by Edmnd Asfield. fecit 1673. very neat &amp; curious but not in a v. grand Manner&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.135). And the antiquary Thomas Hearne noted in his diary for 30 July 1709:<blockquote>The old Duke of Ormond's Picture in the School Gallery was done by one <i>Ashfield</i> from the original drawn by Sir <i>Peter Lilly</i>. The said <i>Ashfield</i> also drew the picture of <i>Duns Scotus</i> in the same Gallery, from his own Invention. Mr <i>Ashfield</i> had a great Genius for Painting, especially for Craons. He liv'd in Holborn Rowe in Lincoln's Inn Field. He was a sober Person &amp; suspected to be a Roman Catholick. (<span class="italic">Hearne</span>, 2.227&#150;8)</blockquote>Buckeridge also mentioned him:<blockquote>Mr Ashfield was a gentleman well descended, who drew both in oil and crayons. He was disciple to Mr Wright, and painted some heads as big as the life. He first found out the way to multiply the number and variety of tints in crayons, and therewith to draw various complections, in imitation of oil-painting. This he performed on paper, and practised several years with deserved applause. He brought whole heads to ten pounds price. From him the present Mr Luttrel had his instruction, who has improved that invention, and multiplied the variety of colours to effect anything; as also found out a method, unknown before, to draw with those chalks or crayons on copper-plates, either by the life, or historically. (Piles, <span class="italic">Art of Painting</span>, 355)</blockquote>From an unspecified source, Ozias Humphry copied the following interesting remark into his memorandum book for 1772&#150;9: &#145;Mr Ashfield's man Garetmurfy [Garret Morphey] painted faster than his Master &amp; did work for himself &amp; his Master too, his Master not knowing&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 22950, fol. 25).<br>
<br>Signed and dated pastels by Ashfield from the period 1673&#150;5 are listed and reproduced by Collins Baker: they include <span class="italic">Lady Oxenden</span> (1673) and <span class="italic">Sir James Oxenden</span> (1674) (both then in the family collection); <span class="italic">The Duke of Lauderdale</span> (1674/5; Ham House, Richmond, Surrey); and <span class="italic">Viscountess Down</span> (1675; priv. coll.). C. F. Bell extends the date range with a further group of pastels, including <span class="italic">Rebecca, Countess of Yarmouth</span>, signed and dated 1669 (priv. coll.), and <span class="italic">A Man, Supposed to be Edmund Plowden (1640&#150;77)</span>, signed and dated 1676 (priv. coll.); both groups were exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1938. At this stage in his life, therefore, Ashfield seems to have been fairly active in pastel, probably attracted, as were other contemporary English artists, by the subtle tonal effects that can be achieved in the medium. This interest in tone is reflected also in the contemporary development of the mezzotint&#151;the first truly sensitive means available to printmakers of representing the effect of light on surfaces&#151;and in the fascination with which the material plumbago (a soft and lustrous graphite, rich lodes of which had been discovered in Borrowdale in the 1660s) was greeted, especially by portrait draughtsmen in the third quarter of the seventeenth century. The flowering of the pastel in England at this time is also related to the general fascination with technique, common to almost all arts and sciences in the period following the foundation of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Ashfield seems to have worked little in the more conventional medium of oil. The paintings at Burleigh House, Northamptonshire, described by Collins Baker, do not provide any evidence towards a chronology of Ashfield's activity, nor for that matter does their style corroborate Walpole's statement that he was taught by J. M. Wright. Hearne's record of him copying Lely accounts more fully for what we can see in general of his style in all media. Furthermore, as Ashfield may have worked for the Norths (see below), a connection with Lely, and an admiration for the greatest living portrait painter, draughtsman, and connoisseur of art in England, are circumstantially likely.<br>
<br>Until recently there was no hard evidence that Ashfield was anything other than a pastellist and perhaps an occasional oil painter. G. C. Williamson, H. A. Kennedy, and J. J. Foster had all attributed miniatures to him, creating a state of affairs summed up by C. F. Bell:<blockquote>It is upon the same mistaken train of reasoning [attributing pastels to Cooper and miniatures to Luttrell] that attempts have been made to attribute miniatures to yet another artist who has lately been held to have been the principal exponent of pastel at this period&#151;the recently re-discovered and already largely mythological Edmund Ashfield&#151;and this although his only ascertained works outside a very small group of crayon portraits are oil-pictures. (Bell, 5&#150;6)</blockquote>In 1987, however, a group of miniatures of members of the North family, Charles, fifth Baron North, his son William, the sixth baron, with Charles the younger son and his sisters Catherine and Dudleya, were offered for sale by descendants of the family. They are all by the same hand and one of them bears the initials E. A.. It is possible, perhaps probable, that E. A. is Edmund Ashfield; if so, they extend the period of his known activity into the mid-1680s. The handling is assured, but the technique not completely conventional for a mainstream miniaturist of the last quarter of the seventeenth century, tending in some respects to transparency in the use of wash. Neither Nicholas Dixon (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1645, <i>d</i>. after 1708) nor Peter Cross (<i>c</i>.1645&#150;1724), the arch-professionals, would have used bare vellum in a miniature as a light source, a practice perhaps natural to a draughtsman used to working in loose colours on paper, but some amateur or occasional miniature painters such as the monogrammist DM (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1659&#150;1676) used this technique. The placing of the figure in the oval, well back in the picture space, also seems very different, more tentative than the approach in the 1680s of Peter Cross, whose notion of portraiture, influenced by Samuel Cooper, brought his sitter's face right up to the picture plane.<br>
<br>From such snippets of evidence, therefore, it is possible to see Ashfield as one of those ambiguous figures, like Thomas Flatman (1635&#150;1688), Charles Beale (<i>bap</i>. 1660, <i>d</i>. 1726?), or Matthew Snelling (<i>bap</i>. 1621, <i>d</i>. 1678), who practised portraiture in various media, sometimes perhaps for money and usually as a gentle or even intellectual accomplishment. That Ashfield was &#145;suspected to be a Roman Catholick&#146; gives him something in common with Samuel Cooper, and that he lived in Lincoln's Inn Fields places him socially and geographically close to where other professional men with an interest in the arts, especially lawyers, lived and worked. What is odd is that his name occurs so little in the annals of a period in which interest in the existence of an English school of painting was beginning to be a badge of patriotism, that Vertue, who collected information from people who should have known Ashfield well, has only one reference to him, and that he is not mentioned in the writings of the Beales or the Norths. More recently, his birth and death dates have eluded even the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scholar Mary Edmond. The statement by Long that he died in 1700 derives from Foster, where it is probably an over-literal rendering of a general dating of Ashfield's activity to the &#145;last quarter of the 17th century&#146;  (Foster, 1.71).<br>
