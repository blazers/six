<span class="headword">White,  Amber  Blanco</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Amber Reeves]</span>  (1887&#150;1981), <span class="occ">writer and civil servant</span>, was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 1 July 1887, the eldest of three children of Maud Pember Reeves 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Robison; 1865&#150;1953)
   [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41214/', "Reeves, Magdalen Stuart")</script>], suffragist Fabian, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38493/', "William Pember Reeves (1857&#150;1932)")</script>, politician. The family travelled to England in 1897, where her father became New Zealand's agent-general. Her widowed aunt, cousins, &#145;and attendants&#146; joined the household in Cornwall Gardens, Kensington. &#145;London was hateful after New Zealand&#146;, she said. &#145;No freedom. No seashore. Streets, streets, streets. Houses, houses&#146;  (Harrison and White, 10267). Educated at Kensington high school and Newnham College, Cambridge (1905&#150;8), Amber achieved a first in both parts of the moral science tripos. Her childhood was overcrowded with cousins, squabbling nursemaids, and parents too much preoccupied with work to pay the children much attention. Her mother, whom she admired, thought her &#145;impertinent&#146; and her father's generosity with books an &#145;extravagance&#146;. &#145;When I complained once that I hardly ever saw her, that I didn't love her at all, she boxed my ears. She was doing more important things, she was too busy to look after a child who ought to be doing her lessons&#146;. Left alone &#145;with a room of her own and piles of books&#146;, she would retreat to her father's study, where she crept under the sofa to read. &#145;I cared more for books than for clothes&#146;. One day, walking down the Charing Cross Road, she opened a book by Kant, &#145;and read the destruction of Roman Catholicism by reason&#146;  (personal knowledge). From then on she determined to go to Cambridge to study philosophy. Her encounter with Freud was similarly random, the result of a mistaken identity in Harley Street in the twenties. From then on she read Freud, Freud, Freud.<br>
<br>When Amber left Cambridge (which she &#145;adored&#146;) in 1908 her tutors&#151;who included &#145;old Dr Keynes&#146;, father of Maynard, who had taught her logic and for whom she never made a single mistake&#151;provided references which described her as a &#145;clear and vigorous thinker [who] can express herself with admirable force and directness&#146;  (J. N. Keynes, Blanco White MSS). However, her intellectual career was interrupted by a passionate love affair with H. G. Wells [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36831/', "Wells, Herbert George")</script>]. Wells's advocacy of free love, or communal marriages, enjoyed a notoriety among the intellectual young, and Amber became his Newnham propagandist. Wells described Amber as &#145;a girl of brilliant and precocious promise &hellip; [with] a sharp, bright, Levantine face under a shock of very fine abundant black hair, a slender nimble body very much alive, and a quick greedy mind&#146;  (G. P. Wells, 73). Country walks and austere conversations about social philosophy soon gave way to lovemaking in Soho and Pimlico while she began her research into &#145;Why and how Men are Citizens&#146; at the London School of Economics. Soon a &#145;trickle of whispered talk&#146;  (ibid., 72) began to undermine their unstable union. (George) Rivers Blanco White (1883&#150;1966), a young lawyer and fellow Fabian, resolved to marry her.<br>
<br>Amber meanwhile became pregnant (seized, to Wells's consternation, with &#145;philo-progenitiveness&#146;), and left with Wells for Le Touquet (and more talk and lovemaking). She returned to London and marriage, at Kensington register office on 7 May 1909, to Blanco White. Wells's novels <span class="italic">Ann Veronica</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">The Research Magnificent</span> (1915) tell parts of this story. Their daughter, Anna-Jane, was born in December 1909. Amber collaborated with Wells in writing <span class="italic">The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind</span> (1932). In August 1939 she wrote to Wells that their love and their daughter &#145;have never for a moment felt that they were not worth the price&#146;  (G. P. Wells, 81).<br>
<br>Their love affair figured vividly in the contemporary imagination and helped to pioneer changed attitudes towards sexual relations. Beatrice Webb, who judged Amber brilliant, vain, heathen, and selfish, as well as shy and sweet, wrote in melodramatic language of the havoc and distress their affair provoked, yet it prompted her&#151;a puritan&#151;to reconsider sexual ethics. Bernard Shaw's heroine in <span class="italic">Misalliance</span> (1909) was Amber, according to Webb, who disliked Shaw's return to the &#145;rabbit-warren part of human life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 133). Reeves wrote three novels between 1910 and 1914 which examined love, marriage, work, and &#145;progressive&#146; women. Two more children, Justin and Thomas, were born in 1912 and 1914. The Blanco Whites lived in London at Downshire Hill, Hampstead, and in Sussex for most of their married lives.<br>
<br>During the First World War, with Rivers away and short of money, Amber worked first for the Admiralty, when she earned &pound;2 a week, and later&#151;at Winston Churchill's request&#151;in the Ministry of Munitions on women's wages for &pound;2 10<i>s</i>. &#145;The average woman takes to welding as readily as knitting&#146;, she wrote. In 1919 she was appointed to the National Whitley Council for the civil service, but was pushed out, like many other women, in 1921. The children, whom she &#145;never saw&#146;, were looked after by a &#145;faithful old nurse&#146; who refused to take a salary; she walked to work and breakfasted with cabbies for 3<i>d</i>. Amber claimed credit for raising munitions workers' wages from 12<i>s</i>. to 28<i>s</i>. She did not like Mary Macarthur who, she acknowledged, had an &#145;impossible job&#151;women don't organize very well by themselves&#151;they'll join the men's trade unions &hellip; they grudge the subscription and don't see what they get out of it&#146;  (Walker and White, 10297). Her fourth novel, <span class="italic">Give and Take</span> (1924), was about life in a government department. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35189/', "Sir Matthew Nathan (1862&#150;1939)")</script>, imperial administrator and close&#151;sometimes intimate&#151;friend through the twenties, admired the depiction of the strike committee.<br>
<br>Rivers Blanco White stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for Lincolnshire (Holland with Boston) in the general election of 1924; together they edited the <span class="italic">Woman's Leader</span>. Amber edited <span class="italic">The Townswoman</span> for the Townswomen's Guild, leaving it when the local people were able to take over. She stood twice as the Labour candidate for Hendon (1931, 1935) because it was a &#145;hopeless&#146; seat and she wanted to signal her opposition to Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the National Government. As a Fabian she had believed that &#145;if you gave people better housing and better food and higher wages and better schools they would work harder and more ardently than they would for private employers&#146;. Describing her pre-war suffragism she said that &#145;living in those days, life was so hopeful&#151;you felt that if you would only work hard enough things would get better and better&#146;  (Walker and White, 10293, 10294). Later, &#145;when I got into the Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railwaymen and the women in tenth-hand velvet hats, when I saw their poor pinched grey and yellow faces in those steamy halls&#146;, she wrote to a friend in 1924, &#145;I knew all of a sudden that they were my people&#146;  (Fry, 87). The snobbery and condescension evident in her observations was about education and intelligence as much as birth. Disillusion with the progress of human nature, and disagreement with the Labour Party's colonial policy after 1945, led to the Blanco Whites' resignation.<br>
<br>From 1928 Amber Blanco White lectured for Morley College, in philosophy and psychology. Eva Hubback, the principal, was a friend from Newnham; Amber replaced her as acting head for nearly two years after Eva's unexpected death in 1949. Lecturing was supplemented by research on banking and money for the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> which culminated in a book, <span class="italic">The Nationalisation of Banking</span> (1934). <span class="italic">The New Propaganda</span> followed in 1939, and <span class="italic">Worry in Women</span> in 1941. But the book which summed up her thought, she said, was <span class="italic">Ethics for Unbelievers</span> (1949). In <span class="italic">Ethics</span> she argues that the origins of moral sense come from the child's conscience. Terrified by fierce passions within and violence without, the child internalizes his severe and powerful parents. Efficient, sensible, encouraging, &#145;above all reasonable&#146; parents will breed happiness and good citizens. Hers is a reasoning Freud. Psychology blends with economics and evolution. Savages and primitives give way to enlightened reason: &#145;until order was imposed and education provided by the English, [the Maoris of New Zealand] were cannibals and among the most war-like, formidable and blood-thirsty of the savage races&#146;  (Blanco White, 77). Civilization was measured in part by the emancipation of women&#151;&#145;every woman must always desire children, a home and a father for them and the love which seems to make these things secure&#146;  (ibid., 210)&#151;and the rights of children; states of mind were less important than actions and behaviour, and moral good must be judged by the kinds of people it produced. Good men and women&#151;the aim of a scientific humanitarianism&#151;were the outcome of good homes; education should include the encouragement of marriage between equals, the wiser handling of children.<br>
<br>Amber nursed her husband after his stroke in the 1960s, and was looked after herself by her cook&#150;housekeeper, a maid, and her daughter-in-law Anne until her own death at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, St John's Wood, London, on 26 December 1981.<br>
