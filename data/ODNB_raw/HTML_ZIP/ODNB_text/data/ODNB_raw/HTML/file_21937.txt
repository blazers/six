<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry Algernon</span>, sixth earl of Northumberland  (<em>c.</em>1502&#150;1537), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, known by the eighteenth century as &#145;the Unthrifty Earl&#146;, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21936/', "Henry Algernon Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland (1478&#150;1527)")</script>, and his wife, Katherine Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1542). He had two younger brothers, Thomas and Ingram, with whom his relations were never cordial. In this, and in several other respects, there is much that is enigmatic about his life.<h2>
<a name="Upbringingandmarriage"></a>Upbringing and marriage</h2>The young Lord Percy was educated in the household of Cardinal Wolsey, who is known to have had a low opinion of his charge, not least for his lack of financial sense. The cardinal continued to bully Percy even after he had become earl, for instance trying to ensure that all his contacts with the king and court were made through himself. He forbade Percy to attend his father's funeral and tried both to foist a household supervisor on him and to control his domestic expenditure. William Worme, the earl's auditor, seems to have been employed as an informant by Wolsey; some time after 1532 Worme submitted a petition to chancery claiming that he had been detained at Alnwick against his will for five years.<br>
<br>No later than 1516 there were proposals that Lord Percy should marry a daughter of George Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury (1468&#150;1538). The king gave his approval, but while he was still in Wolsey's household Percy formed a romantic attachment to Anne Boleyn after her return to England at the end of 1521, when she was one of Queen Katherine's maids of honour. The story that the couple entered into some commitment dogged Percy for the rest of his life. According to the cardinal's biographer George Cavendish, Wolsey stopped the courtship because the king had designs on Anne, but the dating makes this impossible. The likely reason for his intervention was the threat to existing plans to marry Percy to Mary Talbot and Anne to James Butler, son of Piers Butler, who was then claiming the earldom of Ormond against Anne's father, Sir Thomas Boleyn. Wolsey summoned Percy's father to court, and he admonished his son sharply for his recklessness. By the end of 1523 the affair was over; Percy married Mary Talbot between 14 January and 8 February 1524.<h2>
<a name="Governingthenorth"></a>Governing the north</h2>Even before his father died, and despite Wolsey's misgivings concerning his capacity, Lord Percy was seen as a plausible candidate for the wardenship of the east march and other offices in the north of England which the king's suspicion had denied to the fifth earl. In 1522 he was made a member of the council of the north and in October deputy warden of the east march. Thomas, second Baron Dacre, the warden-general, canvassed Percy as his possible successor in the east. Nothing came of this, but when war threatened with Scotland that year, Percy and his father were both among the northern lords chosen to advise the king's lieutenant-general, the earl of Shrewsbury. Then on 2 December 1527, less than six months after the death of his father, the new earl of Northumberland was made warden of the east and middle marches. At once he faced the problem of dealing with Sir William Lisle of Felton, whose violence towards his neighbours had led to his being imprisoned at York after a star chamber action. Sir William broke out of prison and took refuge in Scotland, from where he and a band of gentry followers conducted a campaign of raids on the property of his English opponents and even on Wolsey's lordship of Hexham. After Northumberland's appointment as warden Lisle and his supporters surrendered themselves to him at Alnwick on 25 January 1528. Despite his close connections with the Percys&#151;he had been constable of Alnwick Castle since 25 March 1525&#151;the earl was unable to save Lisle from execution.<br>
<br>While this episode may have damaged Northumberland's reputation in the north-east, he appears to have been an efficient and trusted warden, though he may have taken some time to establish that reputation. On 2 November 1528 he told his friend the twelfth earl of Arundel of his wish to hold Wark and Dunstanburgh castles, as previous wardens had done, but perhaps thanks to Wolsey he was unable to obtain them. However, he was elected to the Order of the Garter in 1531, was considered perfectly competent to manage the war against Scotland which erupted briefly but fiercely at the end of 1532, was <i>de facto</i> president of the council in Yorkshire from 1533, and was granted the shrievalty of Northumberland for life in February 1534. All this implies that Wolsey's assessment of the earl and his persistent meddling in his affairs arose from either a personal dislike or a determined attempt to belittle his former charge; it did not reflect the earl's natural ability. Northumberland may well have enjoyed implementing the king's order to arrest Wolsey at Cawood on 4 November 1530, but even then the cardinal could not take the earl entirely seriously, patronizingly reminding him of &#145;my old preceptes &amp; Instruccions w<sup>che</sup> I gave you whan ye ware abydyng w<sup>t</sup> me in yo<sup>r</sup> youthe&#146;  (Cavendish, 155).<h2>
<a name="Failureofmarriageandhealth"></a>Failure of marriage and health</h2>Northumberland is occasionally recorded at Westminster. Thus in October 1529 he was a trier of petitions in parliament and also attended the very full council session held immediately after Wolsey's resignation as chancellor. At almost exactly the same time he was confronting the collapse of his marriage. Countess Mary had given birth to a stillborn child in April that year, but on 3 September the earl wrote to the third duke of Norfolk reporting how he had ordered that she be &#145;entertained a great deal better than she hath deserved&#146;, and how he had told one of Shrewsbury's servants that he was willing to send her back to her father &#145;with a reasonable finding&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 5920). Subsequently they lived apart. In 1532 the countess stated that her husband had claimed that their marriage was invalid because he had been contracted to Anne Boleyn, now increasingly close to Henry VIII. Recognizing the damage that this did to her position (and perhaps also seeing this as a way to secure an annulment), Mary Talbot told her father, who wrote to the duke of Norfolk, Anne's uncle, who in turn broached the claims with his niece. Anne informed the king and insisted that the allegations be investigated. In July 1532 Northumberland was examined by the archbishops of Canterbury and York as to any undertakings between himself and Anne: he then swore that there had never been any contract between them. Nevertheless rumours to the contrary, and even that their relationship had been consummated, circulated throughout their lives. There was nothing uncertain about the earl's relationship with his wife, however: Northumberland clearly loathed her and took pleasure in leaving her unprovided for at his death.<br>
<br>Northumberland suffered from persisting ill health. In 1529 he reported the return of his &#145;old disease&#146; and expected to die. He was ill in late 1532 and early 1533 and again in mid-1534. In February 1536 he wrote saying that he had not been outside his chamber at Topcliffe for a year (demonstrably untrue), but a protracted illness is indicated. In November 1536, when warned that he was in danger from the Pilgrimage of Grace, he said that &#145;he did not care, he should die but once. Let them strike off his head whereby they should rid him of much pain, ever saying he would be dead&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/1, no. 380). The only account of his physical symptoms comes from immediately before his death, when he was reported to be barely able to speak and losing his sight; his stomach was distended and &#145;his whole body yellow as saffron&#146;, but his memory still unimpaired  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 165). The symptoms suggest liver failure. It is no coincidence that both of Northumberland's doctors, Stephen Thomasson and Thomas Wendy, were rewarded handsomely by the earl, who sought to secure the grant of an abbey for Wendy.<br>
<br>In July 1534, despite his ill health in that year, Northumberland was able to attend the trial for treason at Westminster of William, third Baron Dacre, an enemy who was also the husband of one of Countess Mary's sisters. In May 1536 he was tangentially caught up in the fall of Queen Anne Boleyn. He was not spared attendance at her trial. Like the other peers he gave his verdict against her, then collapsed after sentence of death had been pronounced. Rumours of Anne's pre-contract to the earl were again rife, possibly circulated in the hope of justifying the king's annulment of his marriage to her, and Northumberland wrote to Cromwell reiterating the denial he had made on oath four years previously. Later that year he was too sick to play any role in the Pilgrimage of Grace. The pilgrims were determined to have his support, and following their first assembly at Doncaster the earl was visited at Wressell on 30 October 1536 by his former secretary Robert Aske, who tried to reconcile him to his brother Sir Thomas, but without success. A further visitor next day found Northumberland in bed, &#145;weeping, ever wishing himself out of the world&#146;  (Dodds, 1.284). On 1 November the earl allowed himself to be sworn to the insurgents, having asked the vicar of Brayton to send &#145;two gentlemen of worship to take him because he would be taken with no violence&#146;  (Hoyle, <span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, 446). He then put Wressell at the disposal of Aske (who made it his headquarters), subsequently justifying his action on the grounds that he had wanted to escape from the commons and secure his evidences on the king's behalf; he left first for York and later for Selby.<h2>
<a name="Dismemberinganinheritance"></a>Dismembering an inheritance</h2>It is against the background of a failed marriage and continuous ill health that Northumberland's breaking up of his patrimony must be seen. In 1528&#150;9 he made extensive grants of his west country manors to Thomas Arundell, who had been his contemporary in Wolsey's household. He made sales of other manors in 1531&#150;2. At least some of these should be viewed as attempts to liquidate debts, probably contracted before he inherited his estates. But he also made grants to three young household intimates, apparently with the aim of raising their social status and military capacity, together with large numbers of disadvantageous leases to household servants, a practice which continued until the eve of his death. By the earl's gifts Thomas Johnson was raised from the status of household servant to gentleman (and may also have been knighted by Northumberland in the Scottish war of 1532&#150;3). Sir Reynold Carnaby had grants of leases from 1530 onwards: the earl tried to obtain an abbey for him, and in 1538 he was granted Hexham. In October 1530 Sir Thomas Wharton (later first Baron Wharton) had the grant of the hereditary lieutenancy of Cockermouth, along with six manors in Cumberland and an annuity from the Percy estates, and he received other lands in Yorkshire in 1531. Johnson appears to have been advanced purely from personal friendship, but the grants to Carnaby and Wharton were probably also intended to enable them to perform military functions on the border which ill health prevented the earl's performing himself.<br>
<br>In 1532 Northumberland granted the Percy fee in Craven, Yorkshire, to Henry, Lord Clifford (his nephew and later second earl of Cumberland), although conditionally on his death without male issue and with the reservation of the rents to his heirs. These and other grants served to diminish the estate likely to be inherited by Sir Thomas Percy, the earl's next brother, and in particular some of the grants to Carnaby of lands previously assigned to Sir Thomas. The latter complained to Cromwell in July 1535 of the influence which his household servants had over the earl, saying that they had &#145;caused division between the Earl and his wife, his brethren, and nearest friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8, no. 1143). When Sir Thomas Clifford, the captain of Berwick and also the earl's brother-in-law, took Sir Thomas's side in an increasingly bitter family dispute in 1535, Northumberland turned against him too. It seems likely that by 1536 the earl was determined to disinherit his younger brothers, referring, in a letter to Cromwell, to the &#145;debility and unnaturalness of those of my name&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8, no. 166).<br>
<br>The question arises of the crown's attitude to Northumberland's protracted decline and progressive disinheritance of his brothers. By a statute of 1536 the earl's interest in the estates was limited to life and it was ordained that the king would inherit them on his death. There can be no doubt that just before his death the crown moved to seize the estates to prevent them from being further ruined by grants. Moreover, the crown had purchased the honour of Cockermouth from the earl in 1531 and then in 1535 annulled this grant and received the honour of Petworth, Sussex, the manor of Hackney, and other lands in its place. Superficially it would appear that it was always the crown's intention to annex the lands of the earldom and that it exploited the psychological weakness of the earl to do so, but on closer scrutiny the traditional account does not quite hold up.<br>
<br>First, the crown was interested in the estates because of the failure of an Italian merchant, Antonio Bonvisi, on whose behalf Northumberland had entered bonds. The transfer of Cockermouth in 1531 and, after its return, of the other lands, was for the settlement of Northumberland's exposure to Bonvisi's liabilities. Second, the crown compelled Northumberland to sign covenants in July 1532 whereby he was permitted to sell some further estates to redeem the honour of Cockermouth, but undertook to allow the estates in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Somerset, and Dorset to descend to &#145;one person bearing the name of Percy and the blood of the said Percys&#146;  (Hoyle, &#145;Henry Percy&#146;, 194). These covenants were not honoured by the earl. Third, it was the earl who, by letters of 2 February 1536, announced his intention of disinheriting his brother and making the king his heir, and had articles to this end notarized and sent to London. The statute of 1536 was prompted by the earl. By limiting his rights in the estate, it is likely that the crown hoped to ensure the survival of the earldom. If its lands were vested in the king, they could be transferred to Sir Thomas Percy at some later date. (The assumption that Sir Thomas would inherit the earldom was widespread during the pilgrimage, when he was sometimes&#151;to his embarrassment&#151;addressed as Lord Percy, the courtesy title held by the heir to the earldom.) By May 1537, with reports of the earl's continuing generosity to suitors circulating, the decision was made to seize the estates. On 3 June Northumberland offered to make an unconditional and immediate grant to the king, asking only for some income from the estates, but he died on 29 June.<h2>
<a name="ThefallofthePercys"></a>The fall of the Percys</h2>However, Sir Thomas had himself been executed on 2 June 1537. It has sometimes been argued that the younger Percy brothers took part in the pilgrimage to try to recover the family estates. But although both were said to have expressed anti-Cromwellian sentiments, there is no reason to believe that either saw the pilgrimage as a vehicle for regaining their inheritance. There is no request for the restoration of the earldom in the Pontefract articles drawn up at the beginning of December 1536. Although Sir Thomas had been prominent in the pilgrimage, he was protected by the pardon granted by Norfolk at Doncaster on 4 December 1536. He was tried and executed for contrived offences postdating the pardon, primarily that about Christmas he had received a petition from the monks of Sawley Abbey who sought his advice after the Doncaster settlement. He advised them not to resist any commissioners who came to Sawley from the king, but this was read as aiding the abbey, whose convent had re-entered its lands after its dissolution. In a deposition made by George Lumley of Thwing, who had been caught up in Sir Francis Bigod's failed rising of early 1537 (of which Percy had been ignorant), Lumley referred to Percy as the &#145;lock, key and wards&#146; of the venture  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/1, no. 369). By this he meant that without Sir Thomas the rising was bound to fail; but the implication that Percy could have led a successful rebellion may have prompted fears of a Percy revanche and so ensured his fate. Sir Thomas and his younger brother Sir Ingram were arrested in London in March 1537, and Sir Thomas was tried and then executed in York. He was posthumously attainted in the parliament of 1539. Sir Ingram died in the Tower. Thereafter the earldom went into abeyance until Sir Thomas's elder son, another Thomas Percy, was created seventh earl in 1557.<br>
<br>Northumberland died at Hackney on 29 June 1537, aged about thirty-five, and was buried on the same day in Hackney parish church, with proper dignity and ceremony. There was a monument, but this had disappeared by 1767. The earl made no provision for his widow. Early in 1536 the countess's father approached Henry VIII, asking him not to approve the bill then before parliament confirming the transfer of lands from Northumberland to the crown until his daughter's rights had been secured, and during the pilgrimage he sent directly to the earl to try to obtain provision for her. Northumberland responded that as Shrewsbury had never paid his daughter's promised dower, he could not himself be expected to pay her an allowance, and he died without doing anything for his wife. Negotiations with the crown continued after the earl's death, and the dowager countess petitioned the king in person in May 1542. Henry is reported to have observed that her father had brought her troubles upon her by failing to pay her portion to the Percys. Only in 1549 did she receive a royal grant in compensation for her jointure. Suspected of harbouring Catholics in 1571, she died between 16 April and 6 June 1572.<br>
<br>Northumberland made a will in which the king was named supervisor and Edward Fox, bishop of Hereford, and Thomas Cromwell his executors. It does not survive, and partly for that reason little is known of the earl's cultural or religious taste. He maintained a chantry at Topcliffe, where a priest was charged with praying for the souls of the earl's ancestors, and especially his father and mother, and in 1531 appointed another priest, George Lancaster, as chantrist at Warkworth, where he was to pray for &#145;the good estate of all such noble blood and other personages as be now living and the souls of such men as be departed to the mercy of God out of this present life&#146; whose names were in a parchment delivered to him; Lancaster was also to say a requiem mass for them each week  (TNA: PRO, E326/10479). In 1536, moreover, the earl gave an annuity to his father's chaplain, John Bell, to pray at Leconfield for the souls of the earlier Percys, including his parents. However, Fox was a known reformer, and given Northumberland's education in Wolsey's household, and perhaps also his association with Anne Boleyn, it would not be too surprising if Thomas, Baron Darcy, was correct in claiming (under cover of a hostile reference to Lutheranism) that the earl, like others of his generation, inclined towards reform.<br>
