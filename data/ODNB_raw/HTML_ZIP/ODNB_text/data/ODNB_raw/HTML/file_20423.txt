<span class="headword">Oakeley,  Frederick</span>  (1802&#150;1880), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert, priest, and author</span>, was born on 5 September 1802, at the Abbey House, Shrewsbury, the eleventh and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20422/', "Sir Charles Oakeley, first baronet (1751&#150;1826)")</script>, former governor of Madras, and his wife, Helena (<i>d</i>. 1839), only daughter of Robert Beatson. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20424/', "Sir Herbert Oakeley, third baronet")</script>, later became a Church of England clergyman. In 1806 he broke the thigh bone in his right leg, which left him with a pronounced limp for the rest of his life, and ill health continued throughout his childhood. Apart from a short period as a day scholar at the grammar school in Lichfield in 1814, he was educated by his parents at home until he was sent to a private tutor, Charles Sumner, later bishop of Winchester, in 1817. In June 1820 Oakeley matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, gaining a second class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1824. After graduation he decided to stay at Oxford and study for a college fellowship. He won the chancellor's Latin and English essay prizes in 1825 and 1827 respectively, and the Ellerton theological prize also in 1827.<br>
<br>He was elected as chaplain fellow of Balliol in March 1827. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of London at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, and priest one week later, by his former tutor Charles Sumner, now bishop of Llandaff. In 1830 he became tutor and catechetical lecturer at Balliol, and in 1832 a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral. Among his students at Balliol was Archibald Campbell Tait, for whom he retained a lifelong friendship. In 1831 he was select preacher at Oxford, and in 1835 one of the public examiners to the university. In 1837, on the recommendation of Edward Pusey, Bishop C. J. Blomfield of London appointed him preacher for the University of Oxford at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall. On this appointment Oakeley resigned his tutorship, but retained his fellowship and his prebendal stall at Lichfield until he joined the Roman Catholic church in 1845. He was a friend of John Henry Newman through their membership of a small dining club which met in the years 1829&#150;33, but Oakeley's period of evangelicalism from about 1830 to 1835 ensured that he played no role in the earliest days of the Oxford Movement. His growing attraction to the movement was due partly to his friendship with William George Ward, a fellow of Balliol from 1834, and partly to the influence of Froude's <span class="italic">Remains</span>, published in 1838. Oakeley and Ward became firm friends and almost inseparable companions during their remaining years in the Church of England. Oakeley's Whitehall sermons were published in 1839 and prefaced by a long essay in which he declared his commitment to the principles of the Oxford Movement. In July 1839 he was licensed as minister of Margaret Chapel, the predecessor of All Saints, Margaret Street, and moved to London.<br>
<br>During his six years at Margaret Street (1839&#150;45) Oakeley transformed an undistinguished little chapel into a centre of musical and liturgical excellence. Among his congregation were Edward Bellasis, Alexander Beresford-Hope, and William Ewart Gladstone. After his arrival at Margaret Street, the Oxford Movement took on the appearance of two movements&#151;one at Oxford concerned with doctrine, and the other at London concerned with ceremonial&#151;and Oakeley's great strength was as a competent and acknowledged authority on liturgy. Writing more than fifty years later, R. W. Church  (371) remembered Oakeley as<blockquote>the first to realize the capacities of the Anglican ritual for impressive devotional use, and his services are still remembered by some as having realized for them in a way never since surpassed, the secrets and consolations of the worship of the Church.</blockquote>Oakeley had a love of music, inherited from his mother, and formed a choir. Samuel Wilberforce visited the chapel in 1844 and was critical of everything except the Gregorian chanting, which he found &#145;quite marvellously beautiful&#146;  (A. R. Ashwell and R. G. Wilberforce, <span class="italic">Life of Samuel Wilberforce</span>, 1880, 1.237). In 1843 Oakeley published a preface on antiphonal chanting to Richard Redhead's <span class="italic">Laudes diurnae</span>, and his English translation of &#145;Adeste fideles&#146; (&#145;O come, all ye faithful&#146;) in 1841 guaranteed him an abiding place in English hymnology.<br>
<br>After the publication of <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> in 1841, Oakeley became the most prominent member of an unofficial &#145;Romeward&#146; section of the Oxford Movement, a new and younger generation that caused much embarrassment to Newman. In the same year he published a controversial article on Bishop Jewel in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. The article was heavily critical of the English sixteenth-century protestant reformers and prompted William Palmer to write the first history of the Oxford Movement. The year 1845 was a turning point in Oakeley's life. The publication of Ward's <span class="italic">Ideal of a Christian Church</span> in 1844 fuelled increasing agitation against the Romeward movement. In response Oakeley published a tract in which he asserted a claim &#145;to hold, as distinct from teaching, all Roman doctrine&#146;. He was cited before the court of arches by the bishop of London and, although he resigned his licence before the trial began, he was suspended on 30 June 1845 from all clerical duty in the province of Canterbury until he had &#145;retracted his errors&#146;.<br>
<br>In September 1845 Oakeley joined Newman's community at Littlemore and, on 29 October, he was received into the Roman Catholic church in the little chapel at St Clement's over Magdalen Bridge, Oxford, three weeks after Newman. On 1 November he was confirmed, with Newman, at Oscott, and was a seminarian at St Edmund's College, near Ware, from January 1846 to August 1848. In the summer of 1848 he joined the staff of St George's Cathedral, Southwark. On 22 January 1850 he was made missionary rector of St John's Church, Duncan Terrace, Islington; the church had opened in 1843 and was still heavily in debt. He remained there, increasingly lame and with failing eyesight until his death, ministering to a large Irish congregation who affectionately called him &#145;our Father O'Kelly&#146;. He received no preferment beyond being created a canon of the diocese of Westminster in 1852. R. W. Church went to see him and regretted this fact:<blockquote>The Romans made nothing of him, but sent him up to Islington to live poorly in a poor house with two Irish colleagues, with just a print or two and a few books remaining of the Oxford wreck, which was the overthrow of his old idea of life. (B. A. Smith, <span class="italic">Dean Church: the Anglican Response to Newman</span>, 1958, 225)</blockquote>He continued to publish many works on aspects of liturgy and devotion, notably <span class="italic">The Ceremonies of the Mass</span> (1855), a standard work at Rome, where it was translated into Italian by Lorenzo Santarelli. He was elected a member of the Roman Academy of Letters in 1868. He remained in touch with Newman, Ward, and the other converts of 1845 until the end of his life, and from the mid-1850s he renewed his links with Tait, warmly congratulating him on his appointment as bishop of London in 1856 and archbishop of Canterbury in 1868. The two men remained fond of each other, despite their divergence, and Oakeley could sometimes be persuaded to dine quietly with his former pupil at Fulham and Lambeth palaces. In 1872 he was invited to dine at high table in Balliol College, and was touched by Tait's speech, in which the archbishop said how much he owed to his former tutor.<br>
<br>Oakeley died at 39 Duncan Terrace, Islington, on 29 January 1880, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. To his contemporaries he was a memorable figure. Newman, in his <span class="italic">Apologia</span>, was impressed by his literary ability and classical cast of mind, while R. W. Church recalled his patience, kindness, and gentle humour. Others left more vivid portraits: Thomas Mozley (2.5) remembered him<blockquote>limping about the streets of London &hellip; a misshapen fabric of bare bones upon which hung some very shabby canonicals. Yet his eye was bright, and his voice, though sorrowful, was kind, and he was always glad to meet an old friend.</blockquote>E. Bourne (p. 361) remembered him as being<blockquote>short in stature and halting in gait, with a rough shock head and features deeply lined. &hellip; His first word arrested the attention, and the fascination increased with every sentence that he uttered. His sincerity was so evident &hellip; his reasoning so lucid and his choice of language so exquisite&#151;that when his sharp metallic voice ceased to be heard &hellip; all remained clearly fixed upon the mind for future meditation.</blockquote>
