<span class="headword">Bernard,  Jeffrey Joseph</span>  (1932&#150;1997), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 27 May 1932 at 11 Hampstead Square, London, the youngest of the three sons and the four surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37186/', "Oliver Percy Bernard (1881&#150;1939)")</script>, stage designer and architect, and his second wife, (Edith) Dora Hodges (1896&#150;1950), an opera singer with the stage name Fedora Roselli. At birth he was given the name Jerry, but from childhood he was always known as Jeffrey. After attending a series of preparatory schools he was sent to the Nautical College, at Pangbourne, Berkshire, but was removed after two years at the request of the college commandant, as &#145;psychologically unsuitable for public school life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Sept 1997). During the school holidays he had discovered the delights of Soho, where his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73850/', "Bruce Bonus Bernard")</script> was studying at St Martin's School of Art. From that point on, as Bernard was to write in a spoof obituary of himself (published in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1978), &#145;he was never to look upward. It was here in the caf&eacute;s and pubs of Dean Street and Old Compton Street that he was to develop his remarkable sloth, envy and self-pity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 Sept 1997).<br>
<br>Using the Coach and Horses public house as his base, Bernard worked erratically at a series of mainly artisan jobs, usually in the orbit of Soho, in the course of which he built up an impressive list of acquaintances and drinking companions, including Dylan Thomas, Francis Bacon, John Minton, Nina Hamnett, Dan Farson, and a motley company of the flotsam and jetsam of Soho and Fitzrovia. It was the poet Elizabeth Smart who persuaded him to take up journalism. She suggested a racing column in <span class="italic">Queen</span> magazine. Racing being his other passion in life next to drinking vodka, he accepted the challenge with alacrity. Before long he was writing for other publications, and within a year he had begun to be noticed in Fleet Street.<br>
<br>In 1973 Bernard was paid &pound;30 for an article on alcohol addiction in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, and this led to a series of articles for the magazine stretching to 1975, when he was poached by the <span class="italic">Spectator</span>. Thus began the <span class="italic">Low Life</span> column which ran for twenty-one years, and made his name. The column did not necessarily appear week in week out. The author was drinking heavily by now, with consequent deterioration of his health, and occasionally the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> was obliged to announce, in the absence of his contribution: &#145;Jeffrey Bernard is unwell.&#146; This tag&#151;chosen by Keith Waterhouse as the title of a play based on Bernard's life and writings, which, starring Peter O'Toole, became a West End hit and turned Bernard into something of a celebrity&#151;gave him a not altogether justified reputation for being unreliable. Although he sometimes missed deadlines and his copy often had to be coaxed out of him, Bernard managed to produce some 1000 <span class="italic">Low Life</span> columns over the years, as well as numerous articles and columns for other papers, notably the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span>, from which he was eventually dismissed for &#145;unpardonable behaviour&#146; at a point-to-point dinner. But while several collections of his writings were published, he never wrote a book. He was essentially a sprinter rather than a long-distance runner.<br>
<br>Described by Jonathan Meades (in a <span class="italic">Tatler</span> review) as &#145;a suicide note in weekly instalments&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Sept 1997), Bernard's column was an intensely personal letter to the reader. He was called the Boswell of Soho but really he wrote about himself&#151;&#145;a series of personal and, at times, embarrassing columns about his own wretched life&#146;, to quote his mock obituary again  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Sept 1997). Apart from some Runyonesque set pieces&#151;his account of cat racing at Battersea is a classic&#151;he did not tell stories but simply rambled on, with each funny or profound (or funnily profound) thought leading to the next. The apparent effortlessness of his work led many to think it was produced by instinct, that Bernard was the writing equivalent of a na&iuml;ve painter. In fact he knew exactly what he was doing. The appeal of his <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span> column, he once said, was that he was the first racing correspondent to take the part of the loser. The devastatingly yet selectively honest <span class="italic">Low Life</span> column, too, was about losing.<br>
<br>Bernard's ramshackle life furnished him with ample material. Living always in one room, he spent most of his waking hours in the pubs and clubs of Soho. He could grow irascible as the day wore on, but was otherwise a most engaging companion, with a surprisingly cultured mind. He married four times. His first wife was Mary Patricia (Anna) Grice, a market research interviewer. They married on 18 September 1951 but separated shortly thereafter; she died in 1959. On 13 November the same year Bernard married Jacqueline Sheelagh (Jacki) Ellis (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1934), an actress; they were divorced in 1964. Bernard's third wife was Gillian Dorothy (Jill) Stanley (<i>b</i>. 1942/3), a seamstress and dressmaker; they married on 23 August 1966 and divorced in 1973. Bernard married, finally, on 15 May 1978, Sue Ashley 
    (later Sue Gluck; <i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1948)
  , an advertising worker; they divorced in 1981. There was one daughter by his third marriage. Bernard also had numerous affairs. But drink, he said more than once (he recycled much of his material), was the other woman. Inevitably the raffish lifestyle took its toll. There were spells in the alcoholic ward. Pancreatitis developed into chronic diabetes. His right leg was amputated below the knee and he finished his days in a wheelchair. He died at his home, 45 Kemp House, Berwick Street, Soho, on 4 September 1997, of renal failure; he was cremated at Kensal Green. Most of the reprobates of Soho attended his funeral.<br>
