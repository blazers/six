<span class="headword">Rayner,  Lionel Benjamin</span>  (1787&#150;1855), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Heckmondwike, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 October 1787. His father was a farmer and cloth manufacturer, and died before Rayner was seven years old. Not much is known of his early life except that a performance of <span class="italic">Speed the Plough</span> and <span class="italic">The Naval Pillar</span> at Leeds inspired him to take an interest in the theatre. At the age of nineteen he joined Crisp's company at Cheadle, Staffordshire, where he opened as Clodpole in the farce <span class="italic">Barnaby Buttle</span> and later played Jeremy Diddler in James Kenney's farce <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span>.<br>
<br>Frustrated by his manager, who took many of the light-comedy parts which he sought for himself, Rayner then joined another company at Stone, also in Staffordshire, with which he remained for three years. He played with it at Stratford upon Avon, became as well known for his singing as for his acting, and by his performance of Solomon Lob in <span class="italic">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</span> raised his position and his salary. He appeared in Manchester as Robin Roughhead in <span class="italic">Fortune's Frolic</span>, and then joined the Nottingham company. While in this part of the country he married, at Shrewsbury on 25 December 1812, Margaret Remington, the daughter of the proprietor of the York circuit; they had one son. In the Nottingham company Rayner played Zekiel Homespun in Coleman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span> to the Dr Pangloss of Bannister, who recommended him to the manager of the Haymarket Theatre. He consequently made his first appearance in London at the Haymarket, in June 1814, as Frank Oatland in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">A Cure for the Heartache</span>. He went on to play other characters with great success, such as Sam in <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span> and Stephen Harrowby in Coleman's <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, and was given the opportunity to perform at Brighton, under the management of Trotter. Rayner was devoted to Shakespeare and instituted a celebration of the anniversary of his birth in Sunderland in 1817, which was presided over by his friend Stephen Kemble.<br>
<br>Around 1820 Rayner became a member of the York company and established a reputation for playing rustic characters in low comedy. He also visited Stamford, King's Lynn, Louth, Manchester, and Huntingdon. At Birmingham he became great friends with John Emery. At the end of 1822 he received an offer from R. W. Elliston to appear at Drury Lane as Dandie Dinmont in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>. This was the only part he played at that house, however, as Elliston did not seem to want him for any other character. He was forced to retire to King's Lynn, until Arnold, the proprietor of the English Opera House (later the Lyceum), engaged him to play the part of Fixture in Morton's <span class="italic">A Roland for an Oliver</span> in July 1823. Emery's death in 1822 gave Rayner the chance to step into the latter's shoes and perform his celebrated role of Giles in <span class="italic">The Miller's Maid</span>. As a result of his success Charles Kemble engaged him at Covent Garden Theatre for three years, and he opened there in October 1823 as Tyke in Morton's <span class="italic">The School of Reform</span>. Other parts he went on to play include Sam Sharpset in Morton's <span class="italic">The Slave</span>, Pan in <span class="italic">Midas</span>, Friar Tuck in <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>, and Caliban in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1825).<br>
<br>About 1831 Rayner purchased the lease of Burford's Panorama and proceeded to build on its site the Strand Theatre, initially naming it Rayner's New Subscription Theatre in the Strand. But faced with the opposition of the patent houses, and unable to obtain the lord chamberlain's licence to run the theatre, he was obliged to close it down within a few months. He then worked in the provinces, and achieved great success particularly as Lubin in the domestic drama <span class="italic">Love's Frailties</span>, written for him by J. J. Stafford and tailored to his strengths as an actor. The Strand Theatre had to be leased out to a Miss Kelly, but Rayner did not stop campaigning exhaustively for a lease until at last it was granted in 1836. However, the long struggle left him financially almost ruined, so that he was unable to continue as a theatrical manager. He resorted to writing for sporting newspapers and magazines, having been long interested in horse-racing. He also tried his hand at poetry. While engaged at Covent Garden he had had the prudence to subscribe to its Theatrical Fund, so on reaching the age of sixty he was able to claim from it an annuity, which supplemented his income from journalism. Some time after this he married again. He died on 24 September 1855, at his home, 17 Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road, London, from a disease of the throat which prevented him from swallowing. He was buried on 1 October 1855, in the old burial-ground at Camberwell, near his only son.<br>
<br>Rayner was 5 feet 8 inches in height, stout, with a dark complexion and hazel eyes. He was a good serio-comic actor whose gift for impromptu speech and talent for comic singing were perhaps his chief attractions.<br>
