<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Walter</span>  (1455?&#150;1518?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54246/', "Gilbert Kennedy (d. in or after 1479)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54242/', "Kennedy family")</script>], first Lord Kennedy of Dunure in Ayrshire, and Katherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54289/', "Herbert Maxwell, first Lord Maxwell")</script>. Descended through his grandmother Mary, countess of Angus, from Robert III, he boasted of his kinship to James IV: &#145;I am the kingis blude, his trew speciall clerk&#146;  (Dunbar and Kennedy, 417). The Kennedy family possessed estates in Carrick and other parts of the south-west of Scotland, where it was very powerful and influential. Walter was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15372/', "James Kennedy")</script>, bishop of St Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1465), and his own nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54248/', "David Kennedy")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54242/', "Kennedy family")</script>] became first earl of Cassillis in 1509.<br>
<br>The earliest reference to Walter names him as the sixth son of Lord Kennedy in 1455  (NA Scot., Ailsa MS 66). He was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated in 1476, and became MA in 1478. On 3 November 1481 he was nominated as one of the examiners for the faculty of arts  (Innes, 222, 227, 236). On 24 February 1492 he acted as deputy to his brother John, second Lord Kennedy, in his hereditary office of bailie of Carrick  (Thomson, 212). There is no evidence that Kennedy had a degree in law, but on 29 October 1497 he acted as legal representative for the Cluniac abbey of Crossraguel in Ayrshire  (Donaldson); and was described as &#145;attorney&#146; in an instrument of seisin, dated 29 November 1498  (Ailsa MS 166). It was then common for educated laymen to act on behalf of others in the Scottish courts. On 25 September 1498 he was one of the witnesses to a charter granted by Archibald, earl of Angus, to Janet Kennedy  (Thomson and others, <span class="italic">Registrum</span>, no. 2457). <br>
<br>Unpublished charters and documents, dated between 1504 and 1510, indicate that Kennedy possessed Glentig and other estates in Carrick and Galloway; by 1505, and probably much earlier, he was married to Christian Hynd, and had heirs, of whom two sons (at least) survived him. On 30 July 1510 he was also styled &#145;parson&#146; of Douglas  (NA Scot., Ailsa MS 220). Two years earlier the register of Pope Julius II (23 July 1508) recorded that the prebend of Douglas, together with a canonry at Glasgow Cathedral, were held unlawfully by &#145;Walter Kennedi, who claims to be a cleric&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, no. 38). This evident doubt as to Kennedy's status seems justified; there is no evidence that he was ordained as a priest, and he may have remained in minor orders, which would have permitted him to marry.<br>
<br>A vivid but scurrilous pen-portrait of Kennedy exists, drawn by a contemporary. In <span class="italic">The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie</span>, a verse quarrel (composed before 1505), William Dunbar depicts Kennedy as poor, leprous, and lice-ridden, a thieving highland &#145;baird&#146;, living with his wife in a remote glen. In reply Kennedy's powers of invective match those of Dunbar; he also proudly refers to his substantial properties, and asserts the claim of Erse, or Gaelic, to be &#145;the gud langage of this land&#146;  (Dunbar and Kennedy, 347). Carrick was then still Gaelic-speaking, but Kennedy's own poems are written in lowland Scots.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Flyting</span> was one of the first works printed in Scotland (<i>c</i>.1508); Kennedy's other poems are preserved in the great literary miscellanies, such as the Asloan manuscript, the Bannatyne manuscript, and the Maitland folio. They include a &#145;ballat&#146; in praise of the Virgin Mary, and three moral lyrics, highly penitential in tone. None can be definitely dated, although two adopt the persona of an old man. Kennedy's most substantial work, containing over 1700 lines, is <span class="italic">The Passion of Christ</span>, which is preserved in MS Arundel 285, one of the few collections of religious verse to survive from pre-Reformation Scotland. Owing much to the devotional tradition of the pseudo-Bonaventuran <span class="italic">Meditations on the Life of Christ</span>, it is a learned and complex poem. The story of the crucifixion is related to the hours of the divine office in the week before Easter; and simple narrative is punctuated by highly rhetorical passages, in which the reader is exhorted to feel compassion and contrition through contemplation of Christ's sufferings.<br>
<br>Kennedy's literary reputation is inevitably overshadowed by that of Dunbar, with whom he is often coupled. Yet he was much admired by contemporary poets, such as Gavin Douglas, who styled him &#145;greit Kennedie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Palice of Honour</span>), and Sir David Lindsay, who praised his &#145;aureate&#146; diction  (<span class="italic">Testament of the Papyngo</span>). Dunbar himself, despite the insulting tone of <span class="italic">The Flyting</span>, expressed grief that &#145;gud maister Walter Kennedie / In poynt of dede [death] lyis veralie&#146;  (no. 21: &#145;I that in heill wes and gladnes&#146;). Past scholars wrongly assumed that Kennedy must have died <i>c</i>.1508, when these lines were published. But he seems to have survived until shortly before 18 June 1518; on that date various estates were conveyed to his son, also called Walter Kennedy, who seems, in addition, to have succeeded his father as rector of Douglas and canon of Glasgow Cathedral  (NA Scot., Ailsa MS 241).<br>
