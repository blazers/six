<span class="headword">Markland,  James Heywood</span>  (1788&#150;1864), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born at Ardwick Green, Manchester, on 7 December 1788, was fourth and youngest son of Robert Markland (<i>d</i>. 1828), a check and fustian manufacturer at Manchester, who afterwards succeeded to the estate of Pemberton, near Wigan. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Hibbert of Manchester. In his twelfth year he was sent for his education to the house of the headmaster of Chester School, and from the associations of the cathedral buildings he acquired his taste for antiquarian pursuits. He was trained as a solicitor at Manchester, but in 1808 moved to London and practised there. By 1811 he was residing in the Inner Temple, and on 4 April 1814 he was admitted as a student. The same year he was appointed by the West India planters their parliamentary agent. On 24 September 1821 he married at Marylebone church, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1867), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10144/', "Sir Francis Freeling")</script>; they had a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, who married the Revd Charles R. Conybeare, vicar of Itchen Stoke, Hampshire, in 1853.<br>
<br>Markland remained in London in practice, being the head partner in the firm of Markland and Wright, until 1839, when he withdrew to Malvern, where he lived until 1841. He then moved to Bath and spent the rest of his days in that city.<br>
<br>Markland is best-known as a writer on antiquarian subjects and literary history, a staunch churchman, and a collector of fine books. Contemporaries regarded him as a man of high literary taste, refined manners, and lively conversation. His earliest publications, written when he was living in Manchester, were short and anonymous: <span class="italic">A Few Plain Reasons for Adhering to the Church</span> (1807), and a biographical note on the poet William Mason for volume 5 of Brydges' <span class="italic">Censuria literaria</span> (1807). Shortly after moving to London, in 1809, he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was a member of the select Antiquaries dining club from 1822 to 1834. He contributed several articles to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1815&#150;38) and was director, in charge of publications (1827&#150;9). While director he wrote to the president, Lord Aberdeen, recommending that the society establish a museum of antiquities on the Scottish model. His letter was printed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1828, but he was disappointed as the society failed to adopt his proposal. In 1816 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, though he had little interest in science.<br>
<br>The world of book collecting was more to Markland's taste, and he was elected to the Roxburghe Club at its inaugural dinner in 1812. He edited their publication of the <span class="italic">Chester Mysteries</span> (1818), and was treasurer from 1838 until 1845, when he resigned. His father-in-law was a member of the club, as was George Hibbert, about whom he wrote, anonymously, <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Life and Character of George Hibbert</span> (1837). He gradually built up an extensive library of books, especially rich in fine bindings, presentation copies, and privately printed works. Various authors acknowledged his help, including John Nichols in volumes 1, 4, and 8 of his <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> (1812&#150;14), Alexander Chalmers for the memoir of Jeremiah Markland in volume 21 of his <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span> (1815), and George Ormerod in his <span class="italic">Cheshire</span> (1819).<br>
<br>While resident in Bath, Markland was an active member of both the (Royal) Archaeological Institute and the British Archaeological Association, and contributed to their journals. He gave the opening address at the Somerset Congress of the association in 1856, &#145;On the history and antiquities of Bath&#146;. He was president of the Literary Club of Bath in 1858 and vice-president of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society from its foundation in 1849 until his death. In the same period <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> published numerous articles from him on literary history. His most popular writings on religious matters were <span class="italic">Remarks on Sepulchral Monuments</span>, which was enlarged in 1842 as <span class="italic">Remarks on English Churches</span>, <span class="italic">On the Reverence Due to Holy Places</span> (1845), and <span class="italic">The Offertory the Best Way of Contributing Money for Christian Purposes</span> (2nd edn, 1862). In recognition of his services to the Church of England he was awarded the degree of DCL at Oxford University, in 1849.<br>
<br>Markland was a strong and constant supporter of all church societies; he was entrusted by Mrs Ramsden with the foundation of mission sermons at Cambridge and Oxford, and while resident in Bath three ladies, the Misses Mitford of Somerset Place in that city, selected him for the distribution of &pound;14,000 in charitable works in England and the colonies. He died at his house in Lansdown Crescent, Bath, on 28 December 1864, and was buried in the new Walcot cemetery on 3 January 1865; the first window in Bath Abbey west of the transept was filled with glass in his memory. His library was sold at Sothebys on 11 June 1859 and 29 May 1865. His wife died on 9 October 1867.<br>
