<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scott,  Anna <span class="st"> [Anne]</span></span>, duchess of Monmouth and <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Buccleuch  (1651&#150;1732), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was born in Dundee on 11 February 1651, the third daughter of Francis Scott, second earl of Buccleuch (1626&#150;1651), and his wife, Margaret Leslie (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of John Leslie, earl of Rothes, and widow of Alexander Leslie, Lord Balgonie. It was her father's early death, and more particularly the absence of a male heir and the nature of the entailing of the Buccleuch estate, that made Anna, following the premature deaths of her two elder sisters, Mary (in 1661) and Margaret (in 1652), so valuable a pawn in the family politics of Restoration Scotland, whence she progressed to the margins of the larger dynastic politics of later Stuart Britain.<br>
<br>The complex entail of the Buccleuch inheritance informed the objective of Anna's formidable mother, in partnership with her third husband, David, second earl of Wemyss, which was to prevent any attempted marriage to the Buccleuch heiresses by the heirs of John Hay, second earl of Tweeddale. The latter, an ambitious close kinsman and Buccleuch creditor, was married to Jean Scott, sister of Earl Francis and next heir to the Buccleuch inheritance after Francis's three daughters. To this end, eleven-year-old Mary was given in an illegal under-age marriage to another kinsman, fourteen-year-old Walter Scott, created earl of Tarras. The illegality was used to prevent Tarras's subsequently being able to claim the marriage settlement's extremely generous provision upon Mary's early death. Anna remained the Buccleuch heir, and the same anti-Tweeddale objectives would see Lady Wemyss approach Charles II in May 1661 with the plan for Anna's marriage to Charles's eldest bastard, James Crofts (1649&#150;1685), later duke of Monmouth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24879/', "Scott, James")</script>]. The marriage contract would see Crofts adopt the Scott surname, but in its provision for him it violated both the original entail and the laws of Scotland, settling the inheritance upon Monmouth and his heir should Anna predecease him. Concern in the Scottish parliament was overridden and the contract ratified there.<br>
<br>The marriage of Anna and James Scott was celebrated at Whitehall on 20 April 1663 and consummated on 9 February 1665. It lasted in conjugal terms until 1679, and produced six children, of whom only two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24874/', "Henry Scott, first earl of Deloraine")</script>, survived childhood. On the scaffold Monmouth remained professedly steady to his six-year attachment to Lady Henrietta Wentworth, his last but not his first infidelity. The Monmouths had in common only financial extravagance and a particular excellence in dancing, which was unhappily ended in May 1668 when Anna sustained a dislocated hip which lamed her for life. That she had no influence over the malleable &#145;Prince Perkin&#146; was ultimately to her advantage. Her priority following her husband's 1685 rebellion was to protect the interests of her sons and more broadly the Buccleuch inheritance, with which she identified in a manner that echoed the determination and intelligence that had characterized her mother. Having spent the duration of Monmouth's rebellion in the Tower, and with the injured monarch, James II, predisposed in her favour, she finally secured her husband's confirmation that she had known &#145;nothing of his last design&#146;, thereby freeing her sons&#151;and thus the Buccleuch inheritance&#151;from the penalties of attainder. Attainder having forfeited Monmouth's English titles, the Buccleuch honours, now a dukedom, and estates were formally restored to Anna and thence her eldest son, restoring the original entail, on 17 November 1687.<br>
<br>There is no evidence of Anna's having been marked by the smallpox which she contracted in 1661, but contemporary commentators remark on wit rather than beauty. In character she was confessedly self-sufficient and reserved. Her career at court survived its Restoration and revolution incarnations, being sustained by her friendship with Queen Catherine, the then duke and duchess of York, and the future queens Mary and Anne, and extending to Princess, later Queen, Caroline. It was distinguished by a literary and artistic patronage, with roots in her pre-accident support of amateur theatricals at court, and including Dryden, Shadwell, and Kneller.<br>
<br>In 1688 Anna married Charles, third Baron Cornwallis (1655&#150;1698), with whom she had a further three children, of whom one survived to adulthood; this happier marriage ended with Cornwallis's death in 1698, upon which she retired to Scotland. There she oversaw the lavish rebuilding of Dalkeith Castle and maintained a quasi-regal status, but returned to London upon the Hanoverian succession. She resisted all pressure to relinquish the Buccleuch title in her own lifetime in favour of her son, preferring to be &#145;a man in my own family&#146;. She died in London in February 1732, short of her eighty-first birthday, and was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Dalkeith. Of Monmouth she would never speak, and there is no reference to him on the inscription of her coffin, though the fatal connection is commemorated in the Monmouth Room at Bowhill.<br>
