<span class="headword">Bond,  Derek William Douglas</span>  (1920&#150;2006), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 26 January 1920 at 17 Sandyford Place, Glasgow, the youngest of three sons of Frank Herbert Bond, commercial traveller, and his wife, Dorothy Blanche, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pennington, beautician. His parents had married in London in 1912. The family moved back to London two years after his birth and he was educated at Holmwood preparatory school and Haberdashers' Aske's School, Hampstead. He left at the age of sixteen to become briefly a cub reporter on the <span class="italic">Golders Green Gazette</span> and then a junior postal clerk with Brown Shipley &amp; Co., merchant bankers. However, he was to find his true vocation as an actor, gaining some initial experience at the Finchley Amateur Dramatic Society alongside his mother. His father's grudging consent was eventually forthcoming and Bond picked up some work on an early BBC television play by Karel Capek, <span class="italic">R.U.R</span> (1938), and as understudy and assistant stage manager on the pre-London tour of <span class="italic">As Husbands Go</span>. He was promoted to stage manager and played a small role during the successful three-month London run at the Garrick Theatre. Afterwards he gained a permanent position as stage manager and juvenile lead at the Colchester Repertory Company, one of the leading repertory companies in the country.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Bond responded to a BBC announcement and applied to join the brigade of guards. He was quickly put forward for officer training and passed out of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as a second lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, eventually attaining the rank of captain. He first saw action in north Africa during the allied landings in 1942 and was wounded in the leg on 19 December leading a night attack on some German self-propelled guns near Medjez al-Bab. Invalided back to England, he was awarded the Military Cross and on recovery spent time training new recruits. In July 1944 he returned to active service in Italy and was captured by a forward German patrol while visiting what he believed to be the liberated city of Florence. He saw out the last eight months of the war as a prisoner of war at Stalag 7a, in Moosberg, Bavaria, where among other things he took responsibility for the camp shows. He later wrote a play, <span class="italic">Sentence Deferred</span>, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, addressing one of the troubling experiences he had during incarceration. In 1990 he published an entertaining account of his war experiences as <span class="italic">Steady Old Man! Don't You Know There's a War On?</span> On 28 January 1942 he had married Grace Ann D'Eath, a 25-year-old widow whom he had first met at the Colchester Repertory Theatre. The daughter of Gilbert Edward Trubody, grocer, she had a son by her first marriage, Larry. A second son, Anthony, was born in 1944.<br>
<br>During the period in England recovering from his wound Bond had met Diana Morgan, a scriptwriter at Ealing Studios. During the war the film industry was chronically short of young leading men and Bond gave an audition for a role in the historical film <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span> (1944). Though he was successful, the War Office refused his release and he gained instead a contract with the studio that was to commence fully upon his demobilization. He was somewhat dismayed following his return to England after liberation to discover that his first role for Ealing was in <span class="italic">The Captive Heart</span> (1946), a film about British prisoners of war. He was required to return to Germany immediately to film the location scenes in the former prisoner-of-war camp at Westertimke. In fact the experience laid to rest some ghosts and Bond was fortunate to play in an acclaimed and commercially successful film a sensitive musician who confronts the torture of discovering an unfaithful wife back home.<br>
<br>Bond's big break came with Ealing's ambitious plan to film <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1947) with Bond cast in the lead. The film was only a modest success and suffered in comparison to David Lean's striking adaptations of Dickens's <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1948). Bond continued to play in such Ealing films as <span class="italic">The Loves of Joanna Godden</span> (1947), and as Captain Oates in <span class="italic">Scott of the Antarctic</span> (1948), but no longer in the lead role. As his name began to appear further down the cast list in British films like the first Norman Wisdom comedy, <span class="italic">Trouble in Store</span> (1954), Bond accepted more parts in the burgeoning television service, while continuing to act on the stage. Among his numerous television appearances were roles in episodes of <span class="italic">The Vise</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Errol Flynn Theatre</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">William Tell</span> and <span class="italic">The Invisible Man</span> (both 1959). Briefly, in 1956, he accepted the assignment, untypical for an actor, of television announcer for the BBC, and in the early 1960s he co-presented <span class="italic">Picture Parade</span> and <span class="italic">Tonight</span> for the service.<br>
<br>Bond continued to act regularly on stage and television in the 1960s and 1970s, most memorably as one in a line of section chiefs in the popular spy series <span class="italic">Callan</span> (1969), and his play <span class="italic">Unscheduled Stop</span> was produced for ATV's celebrated <span class="italic">Armchair Theatre</span> (1968). However, the later part of Bond's career was most notable for his controversial term of office as president of the actors' union, Equity, from 1984 to 1986. Deeply conservative and a believer in individual conscience, he clashed with more radical elements in the union following his stage appearances in South Africa. He narrowly escaped a vote of no confidence within the council, but later resigned after the membership voted for a total ban on working in South Africa. In 1989 he also resigned his posts within the council and executive.<br>
<br>His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 11 November 1977 Bond married Margaret Ann (Annie), the 35-year-old daughter of Captain Philip Foster Glover, naval officer. They had one daughter, Belinda. Having lived latterly at 15 Chester Close, Queen's Ride, Barnes, London, he died on 15 October 2006 at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London, of bronchopneumonia following a fall. He was survived by his wife Annie, son, stepson, and daughter. A memorial service was held on 18 January 2007 at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden.<br>
