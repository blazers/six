</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petrie, Sir  (William Matthew) Flinders</span>  (1853&#150;1942), <span class="occ">Egyptologist</span>, was born at Ecclesbourne Cottage, Maryon Road, Charlton, near Greenwich, on 3 June 1853, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35495/', "William Petrie (1821&#150;1908)")</script> and his wife, Anne (1812&#150;1892), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9750/', "Captain Matthew Flinders RN")</script>, the navigator and explorer of Australia. Too delicate to be sent to school, he was educated at home by his father, a skilled engineer and surveyor, and his mother who taught him history, music, and French, and encouraged him to collect minerals and coins. His mother was herself a scholar and published a work on the relationship between mythology and scripture under the pseudonym &#145;Philomathes&#146;. Petrie showed precocity in mathematics and science, and by the time he was sixteen he was often in the galleries of the British Museum, sometimes buying for their coin department Greek and Roman coins picked up in antique shops and country sales. His father taught him surveying, and in his early twenties he would travel about the south of England with measuring tape and theodolite, planning earthworks and ancient monuments; with his father's help he measured Stonehenge, setting a new standard of accuracy for that much surveyed antiquity. The result of these expeditions was a portfolio of plans which he deposited in the British Museum, and a book, <span class="italic">Inductive Metrology</span> (1877), in which he sought to determine the ancient linear standards of antiquity; the experience gained by his surveys, and the natural accuracy of his eye, served him in good stead for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>During the 1870s Petrie senior, a deeply religious man, became interested in the theories of Piazzi Smyth concerning the supposed eschatological symbolism of the Great Pyramid. Flinders himself was at first tempted to believe, but felt that more accurate measurements were needed. In 1880, after careful preparations, he set out for Egypt; his father, who was to have accompanied him, never plucked up courage to go. Flinders spent two winters of solitary, sometimes dangerous work in Giza, triangulating the whole pyramid field and minutely investigating the outer structure and inner plan of the Great Pyramid; his meticulously accurate measurements disproved the existence of Smyth's &#145;pyramid inch&#146; and demolished his theories. He had now formed the resolution to spend the rest of his life, if that were possible, in rescuing the antiquities which he saw everywhere in Egypt pillaged by treasure-hunters and wrecked by clumsy excavators who destroyed more evidence than they obtained. &#145;Egypt was like a fire&#146;, he wrote later, &#145;so rapid was the destruction going on. My duty was that of a salvage man: to get all I could quickly gathered in&#146;  (Petrie, <span class="italic">Seventy Years in Archaeology</span>, 19). His book <span class="italic">The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh</span>, published by the Royal Society in 1883, brought him to the attention of Amelia Edwards, the novelist and traveller whose enthusiasm for Egypt's antiquities had led her, with the help of influential friends, to found the Egypt Exploration Fund. With her encouragement and support Petrie was sent out by the fund in 1883 to excavate at Tanis, in the Nile delta. Single-handed in command of a workforce of over 200, he uncovered huge statuary but also insisted that small broken objects and pottery, hitherto discarded by archaeologists as useless for museum display, had their story to tell. Previously excavators had employed labour gangs, driven by overseers and interested only in recovering monumental remains and museum pieces; all else was discarded. Petrie chose his own workmen, supervised them himself, and rewarded them for their finds, which otherwise might have gone to dealers, their context destroyed. In 1884 he found the city of Naucratis; here and at Defennah, the ancient Daphnae, he found quantities of Greek pottery, confirming the identity of these places as Greek trading colonies.<br>
<br>Petrie soon quarrelled with the Egypt Exploration Fund, whose officials he found dilatory and extravagant, and for the next few years he worked on his own. Two wealthy businessmen, at Amelia Edwards's instigation, agreed to finance his work: in 1887 they formed a syndicate, Petrie to dig, and the three of them to share what finds he was permitted to bring home. The next two years, of work in the Faiy&ucirc;m, were among the most rewarding, and certainly the most arduous, of his life: they brought the penetration of the waterlogged pyramid chambers of the Middle Kingdom, the excavation of a whole Middle Kingdom town, the discovery of the Labyrinth, and the unexpected finding of a cemetery of Roman date in which, day after day, more mummy portraits came to light. Those which he was allowed to bring home to England caused a sensation when they were exhibited in London. Petrie also imported twelve complete mummies and sixty-five skulls. In the 1990s the British Museum commissioned the forensic reconstruction of heads from two of the skulls; the resulting casts in wax and bronze demonstrated the realism of the associated mummy portraits.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1890 Petrie was engaged by the Palestine Exploration Fund to dig on its behalf; he chose Tell al-Hesy, which he (wrongly) identified with ancient Lachish, and in only six weeks cut a vertical slice through the mound in steps, noting the level at which each type of pottery was found; to some wares he could give a date because he had found them in a dated context in Egypt. It was the first stratigraphic excavation in the Near East. Petrie had noted, and admired, the work of Pitt Rivers in England, and had read of the &#145;immense cutting&#146; of Schliemann's work in Troy, but Schliemann himself had denied the possibility that pottery could be used as a guide to chronology. Petrie wrote:<blockquote>Once settle the pottery and the key is in our hands for all future explorations. A single glance at a mound of ruins &hellip; will show as much to anyone who knows the style of the pottery as weeks of work may reveal to a beginner. (<span class="italic">Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement</span>, 22, 1890, 329)</blockquote>Although later work has revised some of his conclusions, Petrie is regarded as the founding father of Palestinian archaeology.<br>
<br>Amelia Edwards's death in 1892, while Petrie was excavating the site of the palace of Tell al-Amarna with its painted pavement, brought an alteration to his fortunes. In her will she left her library and her collection of Egyptian antiquities to University College, London, together with a capital sum enough to endow the first chair of Egyptology in England; she let it be known that she wished Petrie to be the first Edwards professor. His appointment in 1892 gave him the academic status he needed; out of his small stipend he paid an assistant to teach the language; by the terms of his appointment he himself was expected to dig every winter and train students to dig. With his first assistant, James Quibell, he found archaic statuary at Coptos and, in the following year, a large predynastic cemetery at Negada; later he devised a chronological sequence for the contents of the graves by a remarkable statistical method of his own devising, which he called sequence dating. On 29 November 1896 Petrie married Hilda Mary Isabel (1871&#150;1957), daughter of Richard Denny Urlin, of Rustington Grange, Worthing, Sussex. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Petrie's greatest contribution to the study of Egypt's history was the revelation of its earliest phases. When he first began to dig, textbooks began with the pyramid builders: Manetho's early dynasties were regarded as semi-mythical. During three seasons (1899&#150;1903), working again for the Egypt Exploration Fund, his careful excavation of a necropolis at Abydos, near Balliana, revealed the graves of kings of the first two dynasties. At Sinai in the winter of 1905 he found a Middle Kingdom temple with inscriptions in a hitherto unknown script, the earliest known alphabet. In the following year, leaving the fund again, he formed the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, a society whose members were to support his work financially for the rest of his life. His wife laboured as secretary to raise funds and recruit new subscribers. Except for a few years while their son and daughter were small, she accompanied her husband every year in the field; his autobiography is dedicated &#145;to my wife, on whose toil most of the work has depended&#146;. Their archaeological camps, run on a shoestring for students and helpers, became a byword for austerity.<br>
<br>In 1904 Petrie published a small but epoch-making book, <span class="italic">Methods and Aims in Archaeology</span>, in which he described his management of his workforce, his techniques of excavation, of recording, and of restoration, the packing and transport of antiquities, and the publication of results. Each spring, after his return from the field, he would hold an exhibition of his finds, which were then distributed, some to subscribing museums and some for his own collection. The latter was later purchased for University College by public subscription. Known as the Petrie Museum, it is the finest Egyptological teaching collection in Britain. Petrie founded the journal <span class="italic">Ancient Egypt</span> and edited it for twenty years. He published over a hundred books and articles; besides the annual excavation report which came out promptly every autumn, he issued catalogues of different types of objects and a number of more popular books for a wider audience. These and his lectures, delivered all over England, roused public interest for Egyptology and financial help for his work. During his absences abroad, students were taught the elements of Egyptology by Margaret Murray, one of his first students. After two years they would join the professor in the field; many of them became well-known archaeologists.<br>
<br>In 1926 Petrie decided to move his work to Palestine. He excavated three <i>tells</i>, Jemma, Far&#146;a, and Ajjul, south of Gaza, but unfamiliarity with the stratigraphical advances made by excavators since his work at Tell al-Hesy detracted from the value of his findings; after the season of 1934 he was denied a permit to dig. In 1933 he had retired from the Edwards chair and made his home in Jerusalem. Unable to obtain a permit to dig in Syria, he worked for two seasons on a windswept site in Sinai; it was not until 1939 that he finally admitted that his digging days were over.<br>
<br>Those who dug with Petrie were agreed that he had an almost uncanny &#145;flair&#146;. In the Faiy&ucirc;m he found polychrome sherds which he guessed at once must be Aegean; Kamares ware of the Middle Minoan period had not yet been discovered but later, with the Mycenaean pottery he found at Tell al-Amarna, he, Arthur Evans, and Ernest Gardner were able to work out a chronology for Bronze Age Greece. The men from Quft whom he trained to be foremen passed on their skills to their descendants, who were still employed as professional diggers in Egypt at the end of the century. He has been accused of undue haste in publication; better that, he maintained, than to sit on one's material for years, hoping to elucidate every problem: the records were there for future archaeologists to consult. In all he wrote over a hundred books and some nine hundred reviews and articles; he dug over fifty sites and trained a generation of archaeologists. It has been said that he found Egyptology a treasure hunt, and left it a science. Essentially a fieldworker and not an armchair scholar, he was not a linguist, and his theories sometimes met with ridicule, in particular the impossibly long chronology of Egyptian civilization, to which he clung until the end of his life; but his mistakes were small compared with the services which he rendered to the still nascent science of archaeology.<br>
<br>Petrie was knighted in 1923, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1902 and a fellow of the British Academy in 1904. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford (1892), Edinburgh (1896), Strasbourg (1897), and Cambridge (1900). He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, of the American Philosophical Society, and of many other foreign learned societies. He died in the government hospital, Jerusalem, on 29 July 1942 and was buried the next day in the protestant cemetery on Mount Zion. His library was donated by his widow to the new department of antiquities in the Sudan.<br>
