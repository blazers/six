<span class="headword">Dixon, Sir  Arthur Lewis</span>  (1881&#150;1969), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Swindon on 30 January 1881, the only son of Seth Dixon, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Caroline Lewis. He was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, of which for many years he was later a governor, and entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he became ninth wrangler (1902). In 1903 he passed fourth in the open competitive examination for class 1 clerkships in the home civil service and joined the Home Office. In 1909 Dixon married Marie (1863/4&#150;1949), daughter of Alfred Talbot Price, architect; she was seventeen years older than he and there were no children.<br>
<br>It was Dixon's achievement at the Home Office to refashion two great public institutions&#151;the police and fire services&#151;from disparate elements which had scarcely changed since Victorian times. In both he helped to enlarge the powers and responsibilities of the Home Office, imposing his own strong ideals on later development. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he was put in charge of a &#145;war measures&#146; division. From there he could assess the handicaps suffered by police forces and fire brigades alike, given the absence of any effective system for co-ordination and control. Following Zeppelin raids he drew up a successful mutual assistance scheme between fire brigades, an experience valuable in preparing for the war of 1939&#150;45.<br>
<br>At the end of the First World War the troubles of the police, which had led them to strike, demanded attention. In 1919 the government set up a review committee under Lord Desborough, and Dixon became its secretary. The subsequent reports (1919 and 1920) marked a watershed between old and new police services: as Dixon himself put it later, the changes proposed by Desborough offered &#145;what amounted to a new conception of the police as a service, an integrated system, rather than a collection of separate forces each concerned with its merely local requirements and personnel&#146;  (Critchley, 190).<br>
<br>The &#145;new conception&#146; had to be worked out in practical terms and Dixon was consequently placed in charge of a newly formed police division in the Home Office. From there he rapidly gained the confidence, and frequently the affection, of those concerned with police administration: chief constables, members of police authorities, and the new Police Federation. By temperament a brilliant planner and organizer rather than an administrator, Dixon maintained his unique authority, virtually unchallenged, for more than twenty years. His reward came with the realization, when war broke out in 1939, that 183 separate police forces, under his guidance, were already acknowledging not only a local loyalty but also a loyalty to the idea of a single police service dedicated to promoting the wider national interest. Meanwhile, his fertile and ingenious mind always fascinated by scientific discovery, Dixon also cast about for ways of harnessing science to detective work. The development of early radio links within forces, the systematic training of detectives, and the establishment of forensic science laboratories stemmed largely from his enthusiasm and drive.<br>
<br>Dixon was promoted to assistant under-secretary of state in 1932, and four years later he took over the fire brigades division of the Home Office. Convinced that in a future war the real menace would be incendiary rather than high-explosive bombs, he set about developing and equipping the fire brigades with the same drive with which he had modernized the police. Hence he made sure that, on the outbreak of war, ample firefighting equipment was available. However, it soon became clear that the service's fragmented organization was dangerous, and when the first heavy air raids came in 1940&#150;41 the government decided on an immediate and radical restructuring of the whole service. The task of creating the National Fire Service during wartime fell naturally to Dixon. The basic plan&#151;the unification of all firefighting arrangements, with standard conditions of service&#151;was characteristically drawn up within weeks. It was, said the home secretary, Herbert Morrison, &#145;one of the quickest administrative revolutions that ever took place&#146;&#151;and it was brilliantly successful. In thus modernizing both the fire service and the police, Dixon made a large personal contribution towards ensuring the stability of the home front during the war. Recognition came with a knighthood in 1941 and promotion to a special rank of principal assistant under-secretary of state in the same year.<br>
<br>Dixon was shy, and to many colleagues seemed aloof and gluttonous for work. He had little social life: he lived, recluse-like, in a succession of private hotels. He inherited from his father abstemious attitudes: he did not smoke, and was a strict teetotaller. He was an active Christian, and gave great help to the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which he was vice-president. He was also a generous benefactor of the Methodist church, of his old school, and of the Police College. While reserved, however, Dixon was not cold; those who penetrated the reserve were devoted to him. Listening to music, walking, and keeping abreast of scientific discoveries were Dixon's chief delights, but his interests were wide-ranging, encompassing geology, for example, as well as palaeontology, astronomy, and nuclear fission&#151;about which he published a book, <span class="italic">Atomic Energy for the Layman</span> (1950). He was welcomed in many of the observatories and atomic stations of Europe and America, and was a visiting lecturer at Berkeley, California.<br>
<br>Dixon retired from the Home Office on 30 January 1946, but he continued to keep in touch with the two services which he had refashioned. From official papers he compiled three (unpublished) administrative histories which record his work. He died at the Bourne Hall Hotel, Bournemouth, on 14 September 1969.<br>
