<span class="headword">Charlot <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Huber]</span>,  Monica</span>  (1933&#150;2005), <span class="occ">historian and political scientist</span>, was born at 6 Maitland Park Villas, St Pancras, London, on 31 May 1933, the second of three children of Joseph Jacob (Jack) Huber, consular official, and his wife, Doris May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fickling. Her Swiss father had met her English mother while he was working in London for a Swiss tourist association. He was subsequently Swiss consul in London, New York, and finally in Australia, where he died. Monica was brought up in London and Manchester before moving back to London as an undergraduate student at Bedford College. Her father had encouraged her to study German but she had other plans. She took a BA degree in French before transferring to Paris at the age of twenty-one, where she was employed as &#145;English assistante&#146; in a French lyc&eacute;e. She then met Jean Charlot (1932&#150;1997), a French political scientist whom she married in 1956. They had three daughters. When Jean was called up to serve in Algeria at the height of the uprising there, the whole family followed him across the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>Monica Charlot was already thinking of making her way through the French academic qualification system. This meant sitting the <i>agr&eacute;gation</i> exam, a highly selective and competitive process that turned out qualified lyc&eacute;e teachers. On becoming <i>agr&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> in English, she spent a couple of years teaching English in two Paris lyc&eacute;es before being recruited as lecturer by the University of Nanterre, where she watched the hatching of the 1968 student protest that started there with the setting up of the Mouvement du 22 Mars. During these years she had been working on a doctoral thesis, which she eventually defended at the Sorbonne in 1971. Devoted to the study of the general election campaigns in Britain between 1933 and 1970, it was published the following year by the Presses de la Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques under the title <span class="italic">La d&eacute;mocratie &agrave; l'anglaise</span>. Retrospectively this seminal book was seen as a turning point in the tradition of British studies in France, which until then had been almost exclusively identified with literary studies.<br>
<br>Appointed professor of British civilization&#151;the French umbrella term encompassing political and social culture as well as cultural studies&#151;at the Sorbonne Nouvelle University, also known as Paris III, Monica Charlot set out to win British and American political and social studies official recognition as a legitimate branch of British and American studies in general. This she achieved by convincing the higher education department to create a &#145;civilization&#146; paper, alongside linguistics and literature papers, in the <i>agr&eacute;gation</i> exam with a view to giving future lyc&eacute;e teachers a proper grasp of British (and American) politics and society. A born organizer, she brought together the university civilization specialists within a national research centre called CRECIB (Centre de Recherches et d'&Eacute;tudes en Civilisation Britannique), which by the time of her death had some 250 members spread across France. She also provided inspiration and support to the numerous students&#151;over a hundred of them&#151;who wrote their doctoral dissertations under her supervision.<br>
<br>Charlot was also a prolific writer. She published some fifteen books in her own name and contributed to seventeen collective works on various aspects of British politics and society. Her textbooks on British government and politics became standard fixtures on students' reading lists in France but her own preferred productions were <span class="italic">La d&eacute;mocratie &agrave; l'anglaise</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Le temps des incertitudes</span>, a hefty account of Britain's political history between 1945 and 1980, published in 1981 by the prestigious Imprimerie Nationale, and <span class="italic">L'Angleterre, cette inconnue: une soci&eacute;t&eacute; qui change</span> (1980). It is regrettable that none of her books was translated into English except the first volume of her biography of Queen Victoria, <span class="italic">Victoria: le pouvoir partag&eacute;</span> (1989), which was published two years later by Blackwell's under the title <span class="italic">Victoria: the Young Queen</span>. The second volume was never completed.<br>
<br>A longtime member of the Franco-British Council, a bilateral think-tank created by Edward Heath and Georges Pompidou, in 1984 Charlot was appointed director of the Maison Fran&ccedil;aise at Oxford. The perfect candidate to fill this post, she remained there until 1991, and with the support of two Oxford political scientists in particular, David Butler and David Goldey, fulfilled her passion to be a mediator between the two countries. Her outstanding contribution in this field was rewarded with the highest distinctions both in France (Palmes Acad&eacute;miques, ordre national du M&eacute;rite, L&eacute;gion d'honneur) and in Britain, where she was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Monica Charlot retired from academic life in 2002, seven years after the death of her beloved husband Jean. She died of a stroke in Rennes on 20 May 2005 and was cremated. Her ashes were subsequently scattered over the Channel, as those of Jean Charlot had been. She was survived by her three daughters, two of whom followed in their parents' academic footsteps.<br>
