<span class="headword">Shenfield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Farrow]</span>, Dame  Barbara Estelle</span>  (1919&#150;2004), <span class="occ">social scientist and voluntary worker</span>, was born on 9 March 1919, at 207 Bearwood Road, Smethwick, Staffordshire, the youngest of the five children of George William Farrow (1878&#150;1952), a mechanical engineer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. She was born in the heart of the Black Country at a time of economic depression. Like his father, George Farrow was a director of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, a large engineering and steelmaking firm, and the family was reasonably wealthy. Barbara was raised in Smethwick and educated at Langley high school in Oldbury. The fact that both these areas were depressed in the 1920s and 1930s no doubt contributed to her awareness of the importance of social welfare, an issue that was to form the direction of her academic interests and public contribution to charitable causes throughout her life.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate in social and political science at the University of Birmingham, Barbara met Gwilym Ivor Lewis, who was president of the university's Students' Union, and the son of Gwilym John Lewis, clerk of works. They married at St Germain's Church in Edgbaston, on 4 May 1941, when he was serving with the RAF. The marriage was short lived. On 12 August 1941, flying his Blenheim bomber with 226 squadron, Flight Lieutenant Gwilym Lewis was lost at sea, presumed dead. In April 1942 Barbara gave birth to a son, Peter. Bereavement and single parenthood at such a young age were both experiences which influenced and determined the causes she championed throughout her lifetime, together with the pragmatic and unsentimental approach which characterized everything she did. As a working woman and a working mother, both regarded as unfashionable at the time, she challenged the traditionally accepted stereotype of women's role. However, she was not a feminist in the political sense, driven rather by both the necessity of circumstance and her singular character and no-nonsense approach. She believed that women should have the same opportunities as men, but she also believed that women should be centrally involved in raising their children. She lectured in social studies at the University of Birmingham from 1945 to 1956, and later at Bedford College, University of London, from 1959 to 1965.<br>
<br>On 14 September 1951 Barbara married <a name="cosubject_95898"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Shenfield</span>  (1909&#150;1990), <span class="occ">barrister and economist</span>, who lived in Portland Road, Edgbaston, coincidentally the very road in which she had lived as a student. Their civil ceremony of marriage at Kensington register office in London was witnessed by the economist Arthur Seldon, who went on to be a lifelong friend. Unlike Barbara, an Anglican, Arthur Shenfield was Jewish, but to anyone who thought an Anglo-Jewish marriage unusual Barbara was characteristically matter of fact. She and Arthur Shenfield had one son, Martin.<br>
<br>Arthur Shenfield was born Asher Shenfield in Cardiff on 7 October 1909, the son of Mendel Shenfield, a rabbi. Following a state education he graduated from the University of Wales with a first-class degree in economics, then (after further education at Birmingham University) joined the London and Cambridge Economic Service under Frank Parish. Subsequently he lectured in economics and commerce. On 12 September 1940 he married Freida Muriel Cohen (<i>d</i>. 2002), a 23-year-old secretary, and daughter of Maurice Cohen, house furnisher. They had one daughter, but the marriage ended in divorce. He was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1945 (while also active in Liberal politics) and was in practice, and had adopted the first name Arthur, by the time of his second marriage. In 1955 he was appointed as the economic director of the Federation of British Industries. He went on to become an influential academic economist in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, working with thinkers like Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago; he held a string of visiting professorships at other American universities. He positioned himself as a classical liberal and published widely on the subject of the free economy and the free society. He was unafraid to court controversy by, for instance, opposing child labour laws, compulsory state schooling, affirmative action, and anti-trust legislation. He was president of the Mont Pelerin Society (1972&#150;4), trustee of the Philadelphia Society (1977&#150;9), director of the International Institute for Economic Research, and honorary vice-president of the Adam Smith Club. His published books and lectures included <span class="italic">The Political Economy of Tax Avoidance</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">The Failure of Socialism: Learning from the Swedes and English</span> (1998). Having moved back to England, where he was closely involved with the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), he died of cancer of the bronchus on 13 February 1990 at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea.<br>
<br>Following Barbara's marriage to Arthur Shenfield she accompanied him to America where she too took up several posts, including visiting professorships at Michigan State University, Temple University in Philadelphia, and Rockford College, Illinois. She continued in her commitment to improve both voluntary and public sector social welfare provision for the elderly and for single parents, through publication and practical involvement. The republication of <span class="italic">Social Policies for Old Age</span> (1957) in 1973 and again in 2003 indicated the continuing relevance of its subject matter, as it explored the issues of work, pensions, housing, and residential care for the elderly. She published other papers on the subject including <span class="italic">Policy for Poverty</span> (1970), the report of an IEA study group, written with Anthony Christopher, George Polanyi, and Arthur Seldon. In 1971 she became chairman of the national executive of the National Old People's Welfare Council (later Age Concern). In 1976 she became vice-chairman of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service, becoming national chairman in 1981. During the mid-1980s she also served on the Conservative government's review of social security legislation. She was appointed DBE in 1986. She served as the academic director of Britain's only independent university, the University of Buckingham, between 1972 and 1973, and was a member of its council until 1987, being awarded an honorary doctorate in 1987.<br>
<br>After Arthur Shenfield's death in 1990 Barbara Shenfield characteristically threw herself into top gear. She was involved in the management of several charities and organizations, including as a trustee of the Social Affairs Unit (1990&#150;2004) and as chairman of the Friends of the Imperial War Museum (1991&#150;2004); the latter was, for her, a continuation of a cause that had affected her early life so tragically. One of her final projects was to draw together Arthur Shenfield's publications on economics into a book. In 1998, <span class="italic">Limited Government, Individual Liberty and the Rule of Law: Selected Works of Arthur Asher Shenfield</span> (edited by Norman Barry) was published, and on both sides of the Atlantic was received with great enthusiasm. She also took on new causes that reflected the concerns of the time, including directorship of the Pornography and Violence Research Trust (1994&#150;2002).<br>
<br>Barbara Shenfield was a woman of indomitable spirit, and only weeks before her death was discussing and debating at a lunch at the IEA, where Jonathan Aitken was speaking on restorative justice. Her energy and enthusiasm never flagged. Totally self-effacing, never giving in to anything, certainly not to old age, nor to bone fractures sustained in falls in the winter months, she remained undaunted by the cancer which finally caused her death. Characteristically she kept this last illness to herself, getting on with it, willing herself forward so that she could attend the wedding of her son Martin. Attend it she did. As in life and in work, she left nothing unfinished. She died at the Lister Hospital, Westminster, on 17 June 2004, of colorectal cancer. She was survived by her two sons, Peter and Martin.<br>
