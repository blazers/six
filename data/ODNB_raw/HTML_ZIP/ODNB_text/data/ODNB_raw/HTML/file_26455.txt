<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander</span>, fifth earl of Moray  (<em>bap. </em>1634, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">politician</span>, baptized on 8 May 1634, was the second son of James Stewart, fourth earl of Moray (<i>c</i>.1608&#150;1653), and Lady Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1683), elder daughter of Alexander Home, first earl of Home, and coheir with her sister Anne, first duchess of Lauderdale, of her brother James, second earl of Home. Alexander Stewart (sometimes described as fourth earl) was served heir to his father on 23 June 1653, his older brother James, Lord Doune, having died without children. Alexander's youth was blighted by the Cromwellian occupation and the following year he was fined &pound;3500 under Cromwell's <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span>. Although this was reduced to less than &pound;1200, he appealed in early 1656, claiming callow youth and the &#145;small and much charged&#146; condition of his estate  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655&#150;6</i>, 152). Eventually a mere &pound;500 was demanded.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Moray took his place in parliament and the privy council, although his role was minor before the mid-1670s when he was courted by John Maitland, duke of Lauderdale, secretary of state, his uncle by the duke's first marriage. Lauderdale's administration was becoming hard-pressed by both covenanting and noble opposition. Moray proved an enthusiastic suppressor of conventicles and supported Lauderdale's more ruthless initiatives. He became justice-general in June 1675, in place of the marquess of Atholl, and that August was commissioned by the privy council to suppress seditious meetings in the northern shires.<br>
<br>Further preferment was forthcoming as Moray became more closely linked to Lauderdale. In 1677 his son James, Lord Doune, married Catherine Tollemache, eldest daughter by the first marriage of Elizabeth, second duchess of Lauderdale. Moray himself was appointed a commissioner of the Treasury on 27 September 1678 and was nominated an extraordinary lord of session on 17 July 1680. This was the year of Lauderdale's fall from office, yet Moray was not tarnished by association and was himself appointed secretary of state that October. No doubt with continuity in mind, Lauderdale was allowed to nominate his successor, but Charles II, who had a low opinion of many of Lauderdale's opponents, had also been impressed by Moray's loyalty to the Lauderdale administration.<br>
<br>Moray succeeded to Lauderdale's office but not to his power, as the king's brother James, duke of York, became the leading force in Scottish politics. Moray was, however, a favourite of York, just as the earl was an admirer of the duke. When York succeeded as James VII, Moray supported the new king's religious policies and attempts to deliver legal toleration for Catholics. With a view to achieving this Moray was nominated commissioner to parliament in 1686. Indeed, the following year he confirmed his conversion to Catholicism. Also that year he became one of the first knights of the Order of the Thistle. However, with the revolution of 1688 he was deprived of office and retired from public life.<br>
<br>Moray's character impresses itself as that of a loyal servant of government and crown. Although presbyterian historians like Wodrow attacked his suppression of conventicles and his conversion to Rome, his conversion may not have been a matter of political expediency. His trials and tribulations under the Cromwellian regime helped shape his character and responses to sedition. About 1658 he had married Emilia (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of Sir William Balfour of Pitcullo, lieutenant of the Tower of London, and they had a daughter and four sons, the eldest, James, predeceasing his father in 1685. Charles (<i>d</i>. 1735) became the sixth earl, and his brother Francis (<i>d</i>. 1739) the seventh. Moray's territorial possessions were extensive, and in 1661 he received parliamentary ratification of his earldom of Moray and its lands including the burghs of Darnaway, Doune, and Fisherton of Pettie. He died at Donibristle on 1 November 1701 and was buried on 24 January 1702 at the church of Dyke at Darnaway, seat of the earls of Moray.<br>
