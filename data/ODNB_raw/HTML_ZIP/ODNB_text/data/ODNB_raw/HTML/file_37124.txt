<span class="headword">Arendrup <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Courtauld]</span>,  Edith</span>  (1846&#150;1934), <span class="occ">artist and Roman Catholic religious sister</span>, was born on 1 September 1846 at Bocking, Braintree, Essex, the younger child and only daughter of John Minton Courtauld (<i>d</i>. 1877), junior partner in Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co., silk and crepe manufacturers, and his wife, Sarah Bromley (<i>d</i>. 1855). Educated at home, her first ambition was to become an artist. In 1866, after a term at the National Art Training School in South Kensington, she was invited to use a small studio in St John's Wood, owned by her uncle, George Hering (1805&#150;1879), a landscape artist. There she met John Rogers Herbert, a leading Royal Academician, who gave her valuable advice. In the years following 1868 she had several landscapes and religious pictures exhibited at the Royal Academy. Her <span class="italic">Memories of the First Palm Sunday</span> was bought by the National Art Gallery, Melbourne, Australia.<br>
<br>In 1872, on a visit to Egypt, Edith Courtauld met Lieutenant S&oslash;ren Adolph Arendrup (1834&#150;1875), a 38-year-old widower and Danish officer, who was serving as artillery adviser to the Egyptian army. They married on 27 August 1873 and settled in Cairo. There two children were born, a daughter, Agnes, who soon died, and a son, Axel. In 1875, however, Edith Arendrup's marriage came to a tragic end. She had already lost her mother, killed in a riding accident, and her only brother, Julien, who had died suddenly in 1870. Now her husband was killed, leading a small Egyptian army into Ethiopia. Left a widow at the age of twenty-nine, she returned to England in 1876 and settled with her son and two stepdaughters in the developing suburb of Wimbledon. There she learned of the sudden death of her father in Switzerland.<br>
<br>Arendrup survived these distressing events thanks to her deep religious faith. She had been brought up a Unitarian, but about the time of her brother's death she decided to become a Roman Catholic. Her conversion changed her life, and, with the fervour of a convert, she determined to spread her new faith in strongly protestant Wimbledon. In 1877 she opened a small chapel in her house in Cottenham Park. Then, as the congregation grew, she bought land off Edge Hill and had a fine new church built in 1887. She finally persuaded the Jesuits to accept its charge on the understanding that they could also open a day school in Wimbledon. As a result the number of Catholics increased so rapidly that the district was soon being talked of as &#145;a hot-bed of Jesuit Popery&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1896 Edith Arendrup's son died of typhoid. With no further family responsibilities, she sold her house and joined a religious order, the Daughters of Mary. For the next thirty years she worked among the poor in Wapping, Rotherhithe, and Dublin, retiring in 1925, at the age of seventy-nine, to her old home in Bocking, Braintree, now a convent run by Franciscan nuns as an old people's home. Early in 1934 she suffered a stroke and died there on 10 January in her sleep. She was buried in the grounds of the convent. Shortly after her death, a friend wrote of her:<blockquote>She was notable in many ways. She had great artistic talents; she was a skilled horsewoman. But most notable of all were her qualities of disposition and character. With absolute unselfishness, she devoted her life and resources to the building of the church on Edge Hill and later to rescue work in the East End. Her deep and tender sympathy for all who were suffering and afflicted expressed itself in a manner of impressive graciousness and dignity. (<span class="italic">Wimbledon Borough News</span>, 26 Jan 1934)</blockquote>
