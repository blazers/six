<span class="headword">Penn,  John</span>  (1729&#150;1795), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in London on 14 July 1729, one of four children and the eldest son of Richard Penn (1705/6&#150;1771) and Hannah Lardner, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21857/', "William Penn (1644&#150;1718)")</script>, founder of Pennsylvania. At a secret service in 1747 he married a Miss Cox, daughter of his schoolmaster, James Cox, a union into which other family members believed he had been tricked. Then described as an indolent and corpulent young man, Penn was rescued from the marriage by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21855/', "Thomas Penn")</script> (having been abandoned by his father) and was sent to the University of Geneva (1747&#150;51) before travelling in Italy in October 1751. In the following year he moved to Philadelphia where he enjoyed a comfortable life as a member of the proprietor gentry and dabbled in politics and business. Penn was back in England from 1755 before returning to Pennsylvania as lieutenant-governor in November 1763.<br>
<br>These were difficult times for Pennsylvania's proprietary leadership, notwithstanding the initial support Penn received from the assembly. Border disputes with Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland were exacerbated by assaults by Scots-Irish and German border settlers on members of the Conestoga nation, culminating in 1764 with the infamous attack by the Paxton Boys and subsequent American Indian reprisals. Because of this retaliatory action, Penn's early tolerance for the rights of Native Americans gave way to calls for a more aggressive response against the Delaware and Shawnee Indians which prompted the latter to sue for peace in September 1764, signed by the governor in December. During the summer of 1768 Penn organized the proprietor's case for a conference intended to end the territorial disputes between settlers and Native Americans through the Penns' purchase of contested land. The results of the Fort Stanwix treaty were mixed: while relations with American Indians stabilized, the settlement came at a considerable cost to the Penn family who, despite plans to sell on the land to loyal Pennsylvania officers, were unable to resist ongoing encroachments from Connecticut Yankees into the 1770s.<br>
<br>In October 1771, following his father's death earlier that year, Penn returned to England and was replaced by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21853/', "Richard Penn (1733/4&#150;1811)")</script> as acting governor. Relations within the family were currently poor, with John held responsible for the high levels of compensation demanded from increasingly impoverished Pennsylvanian settlers. On the death of his father, Penn now became a minor proprietor of the colony with a one-quarter interest, with the remainder being held by his uncle. Through Thomas's influence John returned for a second term as Pennsylvania's governor in the autumn of 1773. Once more he entered a troubled political environment. Distracted by a renewed threat of border skirmishes from Native Americans, Penn was also involved in bitter exchanges with assembly members over Westminster's alleged challenge to colonial liberties in the wake of the <span class="roman">Tea Act</span> (1773). Penn adopted a conciliatory role as relations worsened between the colonial assemblies and Lord North's government, his aim being to weaken through compromise and negotiation the first continental congress which met in Philadelphia in September 1774. However, his proposals and work as an intermediary between North and the Pennsylvania assembly came to nothing and, in September 1776, the Penns' royal charter was annulled by constitutional convention.<br>
<br>In 1777 Philadelphia was occupied by the British under General William Howe, and Penn was arrested and forced into a year's exile in New Jersey. On his return to Pennsylvania he took a loyalty oath to the new revolutionary government and lived in his purpose-built residence, Lansdowne House on the Schuylkill River, with his second wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of Philadelphia's chief justice William Allan, whom he married on 31 May 1766; the couple had no children. In 1788 he travelled to England with his cousin, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21850/', "John Penn (1760&#150;1834)")</script>, to lobby parliament for additional compensation for lands confiscated during the war for which the family had received &pound;130,000 from the new colonial administration and now obtained an annuity of &pound;4000 from the British government. The last political link between the Penn family and the colony founded by his grandfather, John Penn died in Philadelphia on 9 February 1795 and was buried at the city's Anglican Christ Church burial-ground; his body was later removed to England.<br>
