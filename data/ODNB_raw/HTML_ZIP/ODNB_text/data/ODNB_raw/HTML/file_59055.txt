<span class="headword">Darcy family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1284&#150;1488), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, produced several notable royal servants in the fourteenth century. At the death of Roger Darcy of Oldcotes and Styrrup (<i>c</i>.1284) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54502/', "Darcy family (per. 1086&#150;1333)")</script>] <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7144/', "Sir John Darcy &#145;le cosyn&#146; (d. 1347)")</script> headed the family. He had a distinguished career initially in the service of Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1324), then achieved prominence in the political and military service of Edward II and, particularly, of Edward III. Royal patronage founded the fortunes of his successors with the receipt of considerable gifts of land and office. John's service as justiciar of Ireland provided an enduring connection with the political community there and, although it was with his first wife, Emmeline, heir of Walter Heron of Silkstone, that he had a son and heir, his second wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1359), daughter of Richard de Burgh, second earl of Ulster, and widow of Thomas Fitzjohn, earl of Kildare, provided Irish lands and founded through their eldest son, William Darcy of Plattyn, co. Meath (<i>b</i>. 1330, <i>d</i>. before 1362), a noteworthy junior Irish branch of the family.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59053"></a><span class="headword">John Darcy</span>, second Lord Darcy  (1317&#150;1356)<span class="occ"></span>, &#145;le fitz&#146;, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7144/', "Sir John Darcy &#145;le cosyn&#146; (d. 1347)")</script>; he accompanied his father to Ireland as early as 1324 and followed him into royal service. Under Edward III he commanded a company with Walter Mauny in the opening phase of the Hundred Years' War and was rewarded in 1341 by a grant to him and his heirs of &pound;40 a year for his long service. On 15 July 1346, when with the king at La Hogue, he was granted a further &pound;200 a year for life to maintain himself as a banneret and went on to fight at Cr&eacute;cy and Calais. In 1347 he received his father's land and the office of keeper of the Tower of London for life. Outside the military sphere in 1344 he was appointed escheator of Holderness for life. He served on numerous judicial commissions, particularly in Yorkshire, and on the diplomatic commission to negotiate peace with France in September 1347. Although he never held high office in Edward III's household, he was personally summoned to parliaments from 20 November 1348 until his death. John Darcy &#145;le fitz&#146; married Alianore, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37562/', "Robert Holland, Lord Holland (d. 1328)")</script>, of West Derby, Lancashire, before 1332, and then in 1344 Elizabeth (1331&#150;1368), heir of Nicholas, Lord Meynell. The latter marriage required a papal dispensation, granted in 1344, and was licensed by the king to help John finance his royal service. He died at Notton, Yorkshire, on 5 March 1356 and was buried at Guisborough Priory, of which he had held half the advowson. In his lifetime he had given the advowson of the church of Knaith to the impoverished prioress and convent of Heynings, Lincolnshire, perhaps to support a relative, Margery, who was confined there. He left a substantial fortune to his son, John, born on 24 June 1350. During his minority the family estates were taken into royal hands, the bulk being granted for the support of Queen Philippa, and the remainder to Isabella, the king's eldest daughter. The depredations committed by Queen Philippa's tenants of the estate were so severe that a damning inquisition was held in 1360.<br>
<br>On the death of the young John Darcy on 26 August 1362 the estates passed to his younger brother <a name="cosubject_59054"></a><span class="headword">Philip Darcy</span>, third Baron Darcy  (1352&#150;1399)<span class="occ"></span>, who received his estate in autumn 1373. Philip successfully adopted his father's mantle. He served with John of Gaunt in Picardy and Caux between July and November 1369 and was active in the royal household, being described as &#145;de familia regis&#146; in 1372. He served with the earl of Buckingham in the raid on Brittany of July 1380 to April 1381. He was on the commission to take the homage of the count of Flanders on 20 June 1383, served in Scotland under the duke of Lancaster in April 1384, and under the king in August 1385. He was an active admiral of the Thames and northwards (1385&#150;9) and in February 1389 was being retained for the king's intended expedition in Scotland. In the same year he is first recorded as one of the king's knights in the royal household, probably an uncontroversial appointment. Philip was a justice of the peace in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, between 1377 and 1385, and occasionally served in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Northumberland. He was also frequently appointed to judicial commissions and to array men. Philip was summoned to all the parliaments of Richard II's reign until his death, but by the mid-1390s no longer seems to have been active in the royal or local administration. In September 1397 he gave an oath to maintain the statutes of the preceding parliament, but appears to have retired from public life. Philip had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1412), second daughter of Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton, Northumberland. He died on 24 April 1399 and was buried next to his father in Guisborough Priory.<br>
<br>Philip's son <a name="cosubject_59055"></a><span class="headword">John Darcy</span>, fourth Baron Darcy  (1377&#150;1411)<span class="occ"></span>, received livery of his father's estates on 12 June 1399. He seems to have been able to make an easy transition to support for Henry IV. He was summoned to all parliaments from August 1399 until his death. In May 1402 he was appointed to suppress sedition and then was with the prince of Wales in 1407. However, he never seems to have aspired to, nor achieved, the prominence of his father or grandfather in matters of war or affairs of state. In part this may reflect the declining financial fortunes of the family exacerbated by the longevity of family widows. At John Darcy's death on 9 December 1411 his estate was valued at barely over &pound;100 a year, although this appears to allow for dowers to his mother and his widow, Margaret, daughter of Sir Henry Grey of Wilton, and was suspected to be a substantial undervaluation.<br>
<br>The Darcy family fortunes were not to revive for the next fifty years: John Darcy was succeeded by his son Philip, born <i>c</i>.1398, who never achieved his majority, dying on 2 August 1418. In June 1412 John's widow, <a name="cosubject_59056"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Darcy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Margaret Grey of Wilton]</span>, Lady Darcy  (<em>d.</em> 1454)<span class="occ"></span>, was granted &pound;40 per year from the estate to support herself, her second son, and four daughters. Worse, in 1433 Margaret had to present herself at parliament to prove she still lived and that her Irish estates should not be seized. Philip had married Alianore (<i>d</i>. 1469), daughter of Sir Henry Fitzhugh, his guardian. She received a third of his estate in dower in 1421 and the remainder, not entailed in the male line, was left to two infant daughters: Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1417, <i>d</i>. after 1458), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26642/', "Sir James Strangways (d. 1480)")</script>, and Margery (1418&#150;1469), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61161/', "Sir John Conyers")</script> of Hornby, Yorkshire (<i>d</i>. 1490) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52783/', "Conyers family (per. c.1375&#150;c.1525)")</script>]. The tomb in Selby Abbey, usually attributed to his father, is more likely to be that of Philip. Intriguingly, in 1427 a commission was sent to the abbey to investigate the documents in a chest supposedly relating to the inheritance of some of the family lands. Those estates entailed in the male line, including the valuable manors of Temple Newsam and Temple Hirst, Yorkshire, passed to <a name="cosubject_59057"></a><span class="headword">John Darcy</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1412, <em>d.</em> 1458)<span class="occ"></span>, brother of Philip Darcy. He married Joan, daughter of Lord Greystoke, without licence and only received a pardon in October 1427 on payment of 200 marks. He achieved little prominence and was succeeded by his grandson <a name="cosubject_59058"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Darcy</span>  (<em>c.</em>1454&#150;1488)<span class="occ"></span>, who married Euphemia, daughter of Sir Thomas Langton. The couple are most notable as the parents of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7148/', "Thomas Darcy (d. 1537)")</script>.<br>
