<span class="headword">Shippen <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Livingston]</span>,  Anne <span class="st"> [Nancy]</span></span>  (1763&#150;1841), <span class="occ">journal writer</span>, was born on 24 February 1763 at Shippen House in Philadelphia, the elder surviving child and only daughter of William Shippen (1736&#150;1808), physician and professor in anatomy, and his wife, Alice (1736&#150;1817), daughter of Colonel Thomas Lee and sister of Richard Henry Lee and Arthur Lee.<br>
<br>Anne Shippen and her only brother, Thomas (1765&#150;1798), grew up in their father's elegant town house on the corner of Fourth Street, Philadelphia, between Walnut and Spruce streets, opposite the anatomy theatre in which he lectured on anatomy and midwifery. Between her fourteenth and sixteenth years, while Philadelphia was occupied by the British army during the war of independence, Nancy (as she was known) was sent to Mrs Rogers's school in Trenton, New Jersey. Occasionally she and her mother visited her father at army camp, where he was briefly and controversially director-general of the continental army's hospital department.<br>
<br>On her return to Philadelphia in 1779 Anne was heavily courted by Louis Guillaume Otto, youthful delegate to the French legation. Otto wrote her impassioned and teasing love letters, apparently with some success. Her mother offered tentative support for the match but her father, mindful that &#145;a Bird in hand is worth 2 in a bush&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nancy Shippen: her Journal Book</span>, 101), married her on 11 March 1781 to the wealthy, well-established, but rakish Colonel Henry Beekman Livingston (1750&#150;1831) of New York. On the day after Christmas that year Anne gave birth to a daughter, Margaret 
    (Peggy; 1781&#150;1864)
  . But the marriage was not a success; within two years Anne was living again under her father's roof and, within three, all hope of returning to her husband had faded. Only a brief reconciliation would occur, in February 1785.<br>
<br>Anne Livingston began her journal in the spring of 1783, on her return to the paternal household. It inspired or was inspired by the journal of her friend Bushrod Washington, son of Martha Washington, and by proclaimed impulses of self-improvement and regulation. The journal documents her attendance at the Second Presbyterian Church and her religious and secular readings alone and with friends. In the vellum-covered volumes, prompted by the emerging culture of sensibility, she dwelt on her feelings and sentiments. The journal lays out her hopes for her daughter's education and the companionate ideal of marriage that had eluded her, drawing on the moral and fictional writings of Rousseau and Richardson. &#145;Why was I form'd with a heart of sensibility!&#146; she asked rhetorically  (Library of Congress, journal, 8 April 1784). The journal reveals, too, her informal and formal socializing&#151;sledding, sewing circles and tea-tables, Bartram's Gardens and Peale's Museum, balls and assemblies. But Otto's return to Philadelphia and his short-lived marriage to her sister-in-law Elizabeth Livingston (<i>d</i>. 1787) tried her tranquillity.<br>
<br>The journal was kept carefully for several years but dwindles to a melancholy religiosity and a resigned celebration of duty over happiness. Beyond its pages the historical record tells only of Anne Livingston's failed attempt to divorce her husband&#151;after Elizabeth Livingston's death&#151;in 1789. The difficulty of obtaining a divorce in New York was only sharpened by her parents' resistance and by the troubling implication that she would lose custody of Peggy to her husband, though she was by now supported by her impressive mother-in-law, Margaret Beekman Livingston. Eventually, and after Otto's departure, her husband arranged a divorce in Connecticut; the final diary entry of the journal book (1791) mentions the divorce as a fact. From 1797 to her death in Philadelphia on 23 August 1841 Anne Livingston and her spinster daughter lived, seemingly quietly and permanently together, in Philadelphia.<br>
