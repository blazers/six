<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moody,  Theodore William</span>  (1907&#150;1984), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Belfast on 26 November 1907, the second child and only son of William John Moody and his wife, Ann Isabella Dippie, members of the Plymouth Brethren sect. A scholar and teacher of eminence, &#145;he was driven by an inner force elevated by a dedication which was not just scholarship but which embraced it&#146;  (Martin, 5).<br>
<br>Moody is principally renowned as a major influence on the development of research-based Irish history and its dissemination. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution from 1920 to 1926, when he entered the Queen's University of Belfast; he received a BA there in 1930 after an outstanding undergraduate career. That same year he went to the Institute of Historical Research and King's College, University of London, to begin research under the direction of Eliza Jeffries Davis. R. H. Tawney was a formative influence on him in London. He was awarded a PhD and elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 1934. While in London he met Margaret Robertson, whom he married in 1935. They had four sons and a daughter. In 1932 he returned to Queen's to take up an appointment as assistant in history to James Eadie Todd, his former tutor, before becoming a lecturer in Irish history in 1935.<br>
<br>Moody was among a handful of university academics who sought to transform Irish historical scholarship, and their efforts &#145;took on a distinctly institutional&#151;even bureaucratic form&#146;  (Brady, 3&#150;4). In February 1936 he was the chief impetus behind the founding of the Ulster Society for Irish Historical Studies. Together with Robin Dudley Edwards, a contemporary at the Institute of Historical Research, he created the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences in March 1938 so that Ireland could be represented on the Comit&eacute; International des Sciences Historiques. Perhaps the most significant consequence of their collaboration was the founding of <span class="italic">Irish Historical Studies</span>; the first issue appeared in March 1938 with Moody and Edwards as co-editors. Moody remained joint editor until 1977. Consciously modelled on prestigious academic journals in Germany, France, the United States, and Great Britain, the journal was intended to provide an outlet for Irish scholarship dedicated to the &#145;scientific&#146; study of history. It contained scholarly articles, contributions on research methods, edited documents, critical bibliographies, historical revisions, notices of library collections, reviews of books, and listing of theses, along with inventories of books and articles in other Irish journals.<br>
<br>Moody's revised PhD thesis was published in 1939 under the title <span class="italic">The Londonderry Plantation, 1609&#150;41: the City of London and the Plantation in Ulster</span>. On 5 June 1939 he was appointed to a fellowship in Trinity College, Dublin, and succeeded to the Erasmus Smith chair of history a few months later. In 1940 he was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He held numerous offices within Trinity College (tutor, 1939&#150;52; senior tutor, 1952&#150;8; senior lecturer, 1958&#150;64; and the first dean of the arts faculty, 1967&#150;9), and dedicated himself to bringing it into the &#145;mainstream of national life&#146;  (Martin, 6). On the death of Edmund Curtis in 1943 Moody took on the chief responsibility for managing the school of history, and he remained chairman of its committee until 1977. In 1944 with Dudley Edwards and David B. Quinn he edited <span class="roman">Studies in Irish History</span>, a series of monographs on Irish history which concluded in 1957; he also edited the second series between 1960 and 1975. As a protestant (he began attending the meetings of the Society of Friends in 1960, his wife in 1963), Moody might have chosen to restrict his role to Trinity College, then something of a pariah within the new Irish state, a situation intensified by the Roman Catholic hierarchy's ban on Catholics attending it, but he laboured long and devotedly for the ultimately successful mission of reconciling the college, the Catholic church, and the state. Moody served on the Irish Manuscripts Commission (1943&#150;84), the Irish Broadcasting Council (1953&#150;60), the Irish Broadcasting Authority (1960&#150;72), the advisory committee on cultural relations (1949&#150;63), and the government-appointed commission on higher education (1960&#150;67); this last proved a frustrating experience. From 1972 he was a member of the academic council of the Irish School of Ecumenics. He was particularly interested in radio and television as a medium for education. This grew out of his interest in the curriculum followed in Ireland's schools and in public dissemination of specialist scholarship. In 1969 he wrote &#145;if history at its best is not made available to the educated public as a whole, it fails in one of its essential social functions&#146;  (Brady, 39). Moody suggested to the Irish Broadcasting Council the motif for what became the annual Thomas Davis lectures, first aired in 1953, which present the best in Irish scholarship for a non-specialist audience. With his former pupil at the Queen's University of Belfast J. C. Beckett he edited two series of broadcasts on Ulster, the first made in later 1954 (<span class="italic">Ulster since 1800: a Political and Economic Survey</span>) and the second in 1957 (<span class="italic">Ulster since 1800, Second Series: a Social Survey</span>).<br>
<br>In collaboration with Beckett, Moody wrote <span class="italic">Queen's, Belfast, 1845&#150;1949: the History of a University</span> (2 vols., 1959), which serves as a model for this type of study. That year he was awarded an honorary DLitt. by the Queen's University. Undoubtedly the largest project of Moody's career&#151;the multi-volume <span class="italic">A New History of Ireland</span>, in a format similar to the <span class="italic">New Cambridge Modern History</span>&#151;began with his presidential address to the Irish Historical Society in 1962. He chaired the board of editors from 1968 until his death. The first volume appeared in 1977. From 1964 to 1966 he was a Leverhulme research fellow, and spent 1965 at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton. In 1966, with Professor F. X. Martin, he initiated a series of twenty-one lectures published as <span class="italic">The Course of Irish History</span> (1967), a striking attempt to bring scholarship to the people.<br>
<br>Much of Moody's historical writing is found in articles. However, his short book <span class="italic">The Ulster question, 1603&#150;1973</span> was published in 1974. In 1977 Moody retired; he was elected a corresponding fellow of the British Academy that year and in 1978 awarded a DLitt. by the National University of Ireland. In a much cited lecture (published in 1978) which retrospectively attempted to define his career-long objectives he proclaimed &#145;the mental war of liberation from servitude to the myth is an endless and it may be an agonising process. It is, I believe, one in which Irish historians are called on to take an active part&#146;  (Brady, 24).<br>
<br>Moody was a fastidious scholar, and the combined weight of college, public, and historical burdens led as the years progressed to a legendary dilatoriness. His commitment to fostering &#145;inclusiveness&#146; in Irish life fostered a parochialism which blinded him to influential scholarly innovations in Great Britain, Europe, and the United States. His most substantial authored work, <span class="italic">Davitt and Irish Revolution, 1848&#150;1882</span>, did not appear until 1981. His scholarly reputation will probably remain linked to this study. Although Moody's earlier interest was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, he was entrusted by Michael Davitt's son with his father's voluminous papers. Constructing a biography of Davitt was to be his chief personal scholarly preoccupation. This huge tome, a model of meticulous research, was as much a history of the times as of the man. Overall, the volume reveals Moody's great strengths and limitations. On the negative side it is often excessively detailed, nor could it be termed &#145;value-free&#146; history, given that it reflects the author's own preference for liberal-nationalist sentiment. Possibly Moody's enduring works published posthumously will prove to be the collaborative editions: <span class="italic">Florence Arnold-Foster's Irish Journal</span> (1988) and the multi-volume <span class="italic">The Writings of Theobald Wolfe Tone, 1763&#150;98</span> (from 1998). Moody's historical project began to come under scrutiny during the 1980s, a process that culminated in Brendan Bradshaw's critique &#145;Nationalism and historical scholarship in modern Ireland&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Irish Historical Studies</span> (1989). Bradshaw took issue with Moody's austere methods and consciously directive agenda, and suggested that he was intellectually and politically na&iuml;ve; the net effect in Bradshaw's estimation was to desensitize Irish historical writing. Although this verdict itself has been contested, there is no doubt that Moody's work has subsequently been viewed in a different light.<br>
<br>As a teacher and supervisor of research, Moody commanded affection. A childhood stammer sometimes affected his delivery in lectures but he was known as a fine and committed tutor. A number of the ablest Irish historians learned their craft under his guidance as a research supervisor. Moody retired in 1977 with his health deteriorating. He died in Dublin on 11 February 1984 and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground, Temple Hill, Blackrock. His wife survived him.<br>
