<span class="headword">Jones,  Reginald  Teague-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Ronald Sinclair]</span>  (1889&#150;1988), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 30 July 1889 in Walton, Liverpool, the eldest of four children and only son of Frederick Jones, schoolmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth Deeley Smith. His father, who taught languages, died when he was about thirteen, leaving his mother in straitened circumstances. Friends living in St Petersburg, Russia, offered to take him there and oversee his education. He attended St Anne's College in the tsarist capital and was soon fluent in German, French, and Russian. On return to England he studied at King's College, London, but left without a degree. He failed to pass the Foreign Office entry examination, instead joining the Indian police in 1910. He quickly learned some Indian languages, plus Persian, and was used for frontier intelligence work&#151;sometimes in disguise&#151;before being transferred to the foreign and political department of the British Indian government, who had spotted his unusual talents, and for whom he was working at the outbreak of the First World War. He was then commissioned into the Indian army reserve of officers.<br>
<br>The nature of his duties makes Teague-Jones's career a shadowy one, but he appears to have spent most of the war as officer in charge of British intelligence in the Persian Gulf, and then as political officer in Basrah. However, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from Persia and the Caucasus as a result of the Bolshevik coup in October 1917 and the peace treaty of Brest Litovsk, he was engaged in the urgent task of assessing which groups, if any, of non-Bolshevik Russians or of the indigenous peoples would support the allies in keeping the Germans and Turks from overrunning Persia, the Caucasus, and Transcaspia&#151;and ultimately India.<br>
<br>Teague-Jones himself crossed into Transcaspia disguised as a Persian merchant and travelled along the Transcaspian railway&#151;assessing the possibility of blowing it up if necessary&#151;to Krasnovodsk on the eastern side of the Caspian. After successfully foiling German plans to acquire a large consignment of cotton from the Bolsheviks (for use in the manufacture of explosives), he crossed by ferry to Baku to liaise with the British representative there and to organize a network of intelligence agents in the area, before reporting back to Major-General Wilfrid Malleson in Mashhad. The Bolsheviks' brutality in Transcaspia led to their being overthrown there in July 1918 by social revolutionaries and the local Turcomans, and the new government, the &#145;Ashkhabad committee&#146;, sought British help from Malleson, via Teague-Jones, who sent an urgent report to Mashhad before returning to Baku, which was being hard pressed by the Turks. After a few weeks, however, Teague-Jones was summoned back to Transcaspia, where a Bolshevik force from Tashkent in Turkestan was fighting its way westwards along the railway and seemed likely to recapture the province.<br>
<br>A few days later Teague-Jones was hit in the thigh by a machine-gun bullet at a battle 80 miles east of Ashkhabad. He was removed to hospital in Ashkhabad and, as soon as he was able to hobble around, was appointed British political representative there. In the meantime Baku had fallen to the Turks, and in the frenzied exodus a large party of Bolshevik commissars who were making for Astrakhan, which was still in Bolshevik hands, had the misfortune to be delivered instead to Krasnovodsk, where they were seized by their enemies the social revolutionaries. The gaols of Transcaspia were already overflowing with the hated local Bolsheviks and there was little room for these new arrivals, so the Ashkhabad committee asked Malleson whether the British could take them over. Malleson suggested to his authorities that the commissars might be useful in an exchange of prisoners with the Bolsheviks, but was unsure how he could transport them to India when he was very short of men. While the debate was proceeding the social revolutionaries pre-empted any decision by taking twenty-six of the prisoners out into the desert at dead of night, summarily executing them, and shovelling their bodies into a shallow grave (20 September 1918).<br>
<br>At the time this seemed just one more atrocity in the Russian civil war, but it was to have the gravest repercussions for Teague-Jones. Once the First World War was over and the British had withdrawn from the region in 1919, the Bolsheviks soon recaptured Transcaspia and discovered the fate of their colleagues from Baku, some of whom had been personally known to Lenin. The social revolutionaries of the old Ashkhabad committee, eager to exonerate themselves, blamed Teague-Jones for the decision to execute the commissars, and the affair escalated to the point where the twenty-six Baku commissars became revered martyrs in the Soviet Union, and Teague-Jones was regarded as a war criminal, denounced by Stalin and Trotsky personally. Such were the fears for his safety that he was forced to &#145;disappear&#146; in 1922 and re-emerge as Ronald Sinclair. Thereafter he led a shadowy life, still apparently working for British intelligence until his retirement, and keeping his true identity secret right up to his death at the age of ninety-nine. He received two honours: he became MBE (military) in 1919 as Reginald Teague-Jones, and OBE in 1923 as Ronald Sinclair.<br>
<br>A big ebullient man with a distinctive throaty voice, Teague-Jones was twice married: first&#151;and very romantically&#151;to a Russian girl, Valentina (Valya) Alekseyeva, whom he met in Transcaspia during the war. In July 1933 they were divorced in London, but remained friends. Her parents lived in Krasnovodsk. In October 1933 he married in Cairo his second wife, Else (Taddie), daughter of Hermann Ferdinand Danecker, a German engineer. They subsequently lived in New York (where he seems to have worked for British intelligence during the Second World War), Florida, and Spain. After her death in 1986 he moved to a retirement home in Plymouth, where he was joined by Valya not long before her own death in 1988. He had no children.<br>
<br>Shortly before his death at his residence, Charlton House, 55 Mannamead Road, Plymouth, on 16 November 1988, his first book, <span class="italic">Adventures in Persia</span>, appeared, under the name Sinclair, and it was as Ronald Sinclair that his obituary was published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 22 November. A corrected one, revealing his real identity and the reasons for his change of name, appeared three days later. His Transcaspian journals were published in 1990 under his true name, with the title <span class="italic">The Spy who Disappeared</span>.<br>
