<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Sidney Richard</span>  (1821&#150;1886), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Lambeth, London, the fifth son of the landscape painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38357/', "Edward Williams (1781&#150;1855)")</script> and his wife, Ann Hildebrandt (<i>bap</i>. 1780, <i>d</i>. 1851); their six sons all became successful landscape painters, three of them working under other names to avoid confusion. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2751/', "Henry John Boddington (1811&#150;1865)")</script> adopted his wife's surname but Arthur Gilbert (1819&#150;1895) and Percy used their last forename.<br>
<br>S. R. Percy, as he was known, trained with his father but soon evolved an individual style which was to establish him as one of the most popular landscape artists of the Victorian era. He was best-known for highly finished paintings of dramatic mountain scenes in Wales, Scotland, and the Lake District, executed with a fluent use of colour and a marked sense of design. A view of Llyn-y-Ddinas in north Wales, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1853, was described in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> of that year as &#145;A work of very high character, everywhere powerful, leaving nothing to be desired&#146;. His pictures in this manner, with gleaming lakes and watering cattle, achieved such a fashionable vogue that there is an inevitable similarity in many of these scenes. He exhibited over 300 works in London exhibitions, including the Society of British Artists, and also in the provinces and at the Paris Salon.<br>
<br>In 1846 Percy left central London to join his father at 32 Castelnau Villas (now 92 Castelnau) in the suburban district of Barnes. On 30 June 1857 he married Emily Charlotte Fairlam (1835/6&#150;1904), daughter of a local jeweller, who had stipulated that she would not consider any suitor with less than &pound;2000 a year, a condition which Percy was more than able to meet. After some years at Florence Villa, Inner Park Road, Wimbledon Park, Surrey, the couple moved in 1863 to Hill House, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, where they were neighbours of the watercolourist William Callow, who later remembered Percy as a clever landscape painter, with a gentle and retiring nature. Percy's only visit to the continent was with Callow in 1865.<br>
<br>The characteristic foreground figures which appear in many of Percy's paintings were directly based on his own photographs of Gypsy girls from the encampments on Barnes and Wimbledon commons; a series of these photographs is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. His obituarist in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> later described him as &#145;The well known and popular landscape painter, founder of the so-called School of Barnes&#146;. There is no evidence for such a movement, which is now thought to have been a light-hearted term, which was subsequently given too much credence.<br>
<br>Percy returned to the London area in 1873, living at Bickley Lodge, Meadvale, Redhill, Surrey. His final home was at Woodseat, Mulgrave Road, Sutton, Surrey (dem. 1969), where he died, aged sixty-four, on 13 April 1886, following the amputation of a leg. He was buried at Beckenham, Kent. Percy and his wife had four children, but two died young. His surviving son, Herbert Sidney Percy (1863&#150;<i>c</i>.1940), painted landscapes and portraits in a capable technique but with only minor success. His younger daughter wrote novels under the name of Mrs Fred Reynolds. Her elder son, Richard Frederic Reynolds, killed in action in 1918, was a pupil of Stanhope Forbes. The extravagances of his much younger wife had caused Percy to live up to his income and he was therefore only able to leave &pound;712; a studio sale was held at Christies on 27 November 1886.<br>
<br>Many national and some international collections have landscapes by Percy. <span class="italic">In Snowdonia</span> (1853) is held in the Tate collection. <span class="italic">The Fern Gatherers</span> (1857), in the Castle Museum, Nottingham, includes the foreground figures typical of his work, as do examples in the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull. Among his works in the Museum and Art Gallery, Salford, is <span class="italic">Autumn in the Highlands</span>; and there are also examples in the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath; the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff; Temple Newsam House, Leeds; the Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery; the Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield; the Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery; the City Art Gallery, York; and the Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Montreal, Canada. <span class="italic">Llyn Dulyn, North Wales</span>, purchased by Prince Albert in 1854 as a present for Queen Victoria, is in the Royal Collection at Osborne House, Isle of Wight.<br>
