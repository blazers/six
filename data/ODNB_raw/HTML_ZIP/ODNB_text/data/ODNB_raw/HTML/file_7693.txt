<span class="headword">Dix,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1811, <em>d.</em> in or after 1864), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Bristol on 21 September 1811, of partly Scottish descent. His mother, he claimed, was taught by Mary Newton, the sister of Thomas Chatterton. He wrote poetry about Bristol sites, first published in the <span class="italic">Bristol Mirror</span> and later collected in <span class="italic">Lays of Home</span> (1829). He married, at Bristol on 22 March 1832, Susannah (1807/8&#150;1888), daughter of William Moore, a Bristol soap boiler, and set up in business at Wellington, Somerset, where their two daughters were born; a son was born in Bristol in 1837. His shop failed, and his friends helped him to attend lectures at medical school, to qualify as a surgeon. He appears to have been in practice as a surgeon in Monmouth by 1841, though by his account this was not a success, and he took to writing in order to support his family.<br>
<br>In 1837 Dix published <span class="italic">The Life of Thomas Chatterton</span>, praised by Leigh Hunt as &#145;heart-touching&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Chatterton pervades much of Dix's writing, but despite being the first to attribute and print some of Chatterton's early poems and political journalism, his biography displays a hopeless credulity towards anecdotes, and also misrepresents aspects of Chatterton's life and works&#151;ironically enough through forged documents and a suppositious portrait. Dix's work was later condemned by Moy Thomas, Buxton Forman, and Walter Thornbury, the last concluding Dix had &#145;muddied so many subjects with his wilful untruths&#146;  (Thornbury, 295).<br>
<br>Dix's medical practice failed because of his alcoholism, which perhaps inspired him to write the poems that accompanied E. V. Rippingville's engravings, <span class="italic">Progress of Intemperance</span> (1839). He also gathered his verse for <span class="italic">Local Legends and Rambling Rhymes</span> (1839), and was rashly ranked alongside Wordsworth for &#145;The Church-Wreck&#146; (1842). He illustrated his own poems and perhaps worked as an itinerant artist during the 1840s; later he claimed to have been a journalist, editing the <span class="italic">Monmouth Beacon</span> between 1840 and 1842, an &#145;esquire and body guard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pen and Ink Sketches</span>, 70), and a European traveller. By 1843, when he applied to the Royal Literary Fund for financial assistance, he was imprisoned for debt in Cardiff gaol. Subsequently he became a ship's surgeon on an emigrant vessel to New York. A Boston edition of his <span class="italic">Chatterton</span> appeared in 1845, and he wrote a handbook for Lake Memphremagog (1845) and <span class="italic">Local Loiterings</span> (1846). The attribution to him of <span class="italic">Jack Ariel</span> (1847), a novel on board an Indiaman, is dubious: none of Dix's other publications is written with the same verve, and he makes no use of India and China elsewhere.<br>
<br>While in America Dix took the temperance pledge but resumed drinking on his return to London. He was apparently drunk for five years, during which time he was arrested for intoxication, but discharged. In a further application to the Royal Literary Fund, at the end of 1847, he was described as chronically ill and destitute. His adventures during this period, which include writing ballads and verses for St Valentine cards, are described in <span class="italic">Passages from the History of a Wasted Life</span> (1853)&#151;although here, as elsewhere, everything Dix says must be treated with extreme scepticism. <span class="italic">Pen and Ink Sketches</span> had appeared in 1846, in which Dix reminisced about his encounters with Hannah More, Feargus O'Connor, Felicia Hemans, Robert Southey, Joseph Cottle, and Ebeneezer Elliott, among others. Although most of these memoirs were drunken fantasies, he nevertheless followed it up in 1852 with the equally imaginary <span class="italic">Lions: Living and Dead</span>, which includes his accounts of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Lamb, Shelley, Hazlitt, and various other luminaries.<br>
<br>Dix abandoned his family in Bristol, returned to America, took the name John Ross Dix, and lived in Newport, publishing <span class="italic">Loiterings in America</span> in 1850. He continued to write poetry, and contributed the text to J. Wesley Jones's <span class="italic">Amusing and Thrilling Adventures of a Californian Artist</span> (1854). He rejoined the temperance movement, publishing <span class="italic">The Worth of the Worthless</span> (with illustrations by Hammatt Billings) under the Shakespeare Division of the Sons of Temperance in 1854, and his religious faith was also restored: between 1851 and 1854 he published three accounts of popular preachers. <span class="italic">The New Apostles</span> (1860), an attack on the Catholic Apostolic church, has also been attributed to Dix; if so, it involved him in a theological dispute with Edward Wilton Eddis and John George Francis. John Dix's last works appear to be unionist civil war ballads, published in 1864; more than a dozen survive.<br>
<br>A review of <span class="italic">Wasted Life</span> described the author as &#145;rather slender&#151;of a nervous bilious temperament&#151;has black curly hair &hellip; a nose that would have suited Napoleon&#151;and his pale classic face is lit up with a pair of black eyes&#146;  (Dix, <span class="italic">Wasted Life</span>, preface). He was twitchy, and given to blinking rapidly when excited. Dix had at least one son, the hymn writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97110/', "William Chatterton Dix")</script>.<br>
