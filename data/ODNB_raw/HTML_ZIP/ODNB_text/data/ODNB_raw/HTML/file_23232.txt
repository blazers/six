<span class="headword">Reading,  Burnet</span>  (1749/50&#150;1838), <span class="occ">engraver and draughtsman</span>, was born in Colchester of unknown parents. By 1770 he was working in London, producing engraved portraits for booksellers. Some of his portraits were printed in red, according to the fashion of the time, and he often worked in stipple. All his portraits are lively and bold in their style. His subjects tend to be contemporary celebrities, from the actor David Garrick to the painter Benjamin West and the socialite Emma Hamilton. He produced a set of six portraits of members of the Royal Academy from drawings by Peter Falconet. Many of his portraits appeared in Bell's <span class="italic">British Theatre</span> (1776&#150;86) and the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (1783&#150;93). Reading's love of theatrical subjects in particular is reflected in the fact that he executed a series of twelve etchings from drawings by Mortimer, <span class="italic">Characters to Illustrate Shakespeare</span>, published by T. and H. Rodd, and produced some of the plates to Boydell's <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>. He also engraved various portraits of politicians and historical figures. In 1783 he produced a set of portraits of members of the American congress, and he was responsible for many of the portraits in Granger's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (1820 and 1822), including that of Oliver Cromwell. Other engravings included <span class="italic">Lavinia and her Mother</span>, after W. Bigg, and <span class="italic">Charlotte at the Tomb of Wether</span>, which was executed after his own design. The British Museum holds a collection of sixty-two examples of his portrait engravings, one of which is a self-portrait.<br>
<br>Reading was employed as drawing- and riding-master by the earl of Pomfret at Windsor, although there is no evidence as to when he held this position. A portrait of him was etched by Samuel De Wilde in 1798. This shows him as a young man, wearing a broad-brimmed hat. He sits in a chair, leaning one arm on the back of the chair; his flamboyant pose and direct gaze are an indication of his confidence and hint at a slight arrogance in his character. His last engravings were published in 1822; he died in north London late in 1838 and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
