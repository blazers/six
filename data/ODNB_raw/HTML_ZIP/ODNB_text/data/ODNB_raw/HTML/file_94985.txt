<span class="headword">Marriott,  (George Thomas) Moore</span>  (1885&#150;1949), <span class="occ">film actor</span>, was born at Alpha Place, Yiewsley, Middlesex, on 14 September 1885, the son of George Matthew Marriott (1859&#150;1940), who was then a commercial traveller, and his wife, Edith Rousby, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coleman (1864&#150;1946). His parents were actors, and his father became a theatrical manager. Marriott was appearing on stage by the age of five. He entered films possibly as early as 1906, working in a number of one-reelers at Cecil Hepworth's studios at Walton-on-Thames, where he became known for being a master of disguise, able to take on multiple roles. He married, at Barrow-in-Furness on 2 January 1908, Annie Rose Elizabeth Stone (1886&#150;1931), daughter of George Stone. They had three daughters and a son. In November 1915 he enlisted in the Army Service Corps and served during the First World War as a motorcycle dispatch rider.<br>
<br>After the war Marriott's career continued with a series of films for the director Bert Haldane at Famous Pictures, followed by some adaptations of works by W. W. Jacobs, including the lead in a 1923 version of Jacobs's <span class="italic">The Monkey's Paw</span>. Marriott's facility with make-up ensured that many of these parts were as older men, this versatility aided by five sets of false teeth which he could use as required. He appeared in three films based on stories by P. G. Wodehouse in 1924, but perhaps his most important silent film came in 1928 when he took on the title role in a version of <span class="italic">Sweeney Todd</span> which, like the opening reels of <span class="italic">The Monkey's Paw</span>, has survived.<br>
<br>The coming of sound did not interrupt Marriott's progress, and though fewer starring roles came his way he developed as a character actor. While he remained prolific&#151;Marriott once claimed to have completed over 300 films in his career&#151;he felt that his career was in decline. In 1936 he put out a self-promoting publicity brochure to agents and producers. One of the pictures he included was from his performance as the elderly Tom Cobley in <span class="italic">Widecombe Fair</span> (1928). This caught the eye of the team at Gainsborough Studios, who were seeking to cast an old man as a stooge for the comedian Will Hay. He was given a role in <span class="italic">Windbag the Sailor</span> (1936), a part which secured him a contract with the studio.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Windbag the Sailor</span> Marriott was cast as the old, wily Jeremiah Harbottle alongside Graham Moffatt as contrasting stooges to Will Hay. Over the next three years the trio went on to make six films together, all but one directed by Marcel Varnel. Will Hay starred as the duplicitous schemer inveigling his way into a position of authority; Marriott's Jerry, sporting a one-tooth plate, was the irascible, garrulous but dim reprobate; and Moffatt's Albert was the insolent but resourceful sidekick. They were lucky to be served by top-class scriptwriters, notably Marriott Edgar and Val Guest, who, with the help of J. O. C. Orton, provided them with their best film, the classic <span class="italic">Oh, Mr Porter!</span> (1937), in which they played the staff at a sleepy railway station in Ireland who unwittingly get involved in a gun-running intrigue. In it Marriott gruffly delivered one of the best-remembered lines in British comedy&#151;&#145;Next train's gone!&#146; Nevertheless, Marriott's finest overall performance came in another Will Hay vehicle, <span class="italic">Convict 99</span>, where he played Jerry the Mole, a gaolbird forever trying to tunnel his way to freedom.<br>
<br>In the end Will Hay felt the need to assert his authority as a star comedian and detached himself from his stooges&#151;but the value of Marriott and Moffatt to Gainsborough Studios as a duo was apparent. They were cast as support to a number of other comedians including Arthur Askey, Bebe Daniels, and the Crazy Gang. Their most memorable scene as a duo outside the Hay films was as comic relief in a 1938 Will Fyffe melodrama, <span class="italic">Owd Bob</span>. In 1939 they were loaned out to Ealing Studios for <span class="italic">Cheer Boys Cheer</span>, a notable precursor to the classic Ealing comedy in which they play workmates at a cosy brewery. They also worked together on stage, touring Harry Tate's celebrated motoring sketch with Tate's son in 1941, and the following year they starred in a travelling revue, <span class="italic">Now Then Boys</span>. On radio they completed a six-part series in 1942, <span class="italic">A Slight Delay</span>, scripted by their regular film writers Val Guest and Marriott Edgar. Their last joint appearance was in the 1944 Tommy Handley vehicle <span class="italic">Time Flies</span>, which featured Marriott as an unfortunate Elizabethan soothsayer clamped in the stocks, with Moffatt as his nephew.<br>
<br>Marriott's versatility had meant there was always a demand for his services on radio, stage, and film with or without Moffatt. He was superb in a straight role as the father whose family is pulled apart by the war in <span class="italic">Millions Like Us</span> (1943). At the end of the war poor health caused him to cut down his work schedule, though he did enjoy a short stint as a regular in the <span class="italic">Jack Buchanan Radio Programme</span> in 1945. His post-war film roles may have been less prominent, but he still received some excellent parts. He made his mark as the first murder victim in the 1946 whodunnit <span class="italic">Green for Danger</span> and the avenging farmer in the 1947 melodrama <span class="italic">The Root of All Evil</span>. His final film appearance was in the 1949 Ben Wrigley farce <span class="italic">High Jinks in Society</span>.<br>
<br>Marriott's marriage had broken down by 1919, and he settled down with Grace Lillian Williamson. He died at their home, 82 Rose Green Road, Bognor Regis, Sussex, of a heart attack, on 11 December 1949 and his ashes were interred at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
