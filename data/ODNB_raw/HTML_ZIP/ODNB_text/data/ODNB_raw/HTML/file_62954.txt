<span class="headword">O'Donovan,  Gerald</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jeremiah Donovan]</span>  (1871&#150;1942), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and writer</span>, was born on 15 July 1871 in Newry Street, Kilkeel, co. Down, Ireland, the youngest of six children of Jeremiah Donovan, pier builder in the board of works, and Margaret Regan. O'Donovan attended national schools in Cork, Galway, and Sligo, and secondary school at Ardnaree College (then the seminary for Killala diocese). After training in St Patrick's College, Maynooth (1889&#150;95), Father O'Donovan became administrator of the Loughrea parish, co. Galway (1896&#150;1904), where he was the model of an engaged priest. He founded a branch of the Total Abstinence Society in a disused military barracks and set about the reinvigoration of town life. His enthusiasm for the Gaelic League, Irish Cooperative Association, and National Literary Society made him a national figure, the plain-speaking patriot priest. Both in articles and lectures, O'Donovan laid blame for the condition of Ireland&#151;poor, English-speaking, and spiritless&#151;partly on the clergy themselves.<br>
<br>Given his head in the decoration of St Brendan's Cathedral in Loughrea, O'Donovan chose in 1901 to employ Irish artists such as Sarah Purser, John Hughes, and the Yeats sisters, some of whom were not themselves Catholic. St Brendan's, heavily financed by O'Donovan's close friend the landlord and playwright Edward Martyn, is a museum of <i>fin de si&egrave;cle nouveau</i>-Celtic decoration and the most notable cathedral of its period in Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1903 a new bishop was installed in Loughrea, Thomas O'Dea, a Maynooth priest who had once disciplined O'Donovan for reading books deemed unbecoming for a seminarian to read. Bishop O'Dea tightened the reins once again; rather than submit, O'Donovan left Loughrea in October 1904. Of the hundreds of townspeople who gathered along the road to the railway station, some knelt to be blessed by the troubled, departing priest, who would never bless another.<br>
<br>Armed with letters of introduction from Ascendancy literary friends, Lady Gregory, W. B. Yeats, and George Moore (who drew on O'Donovan's dilemma for his novel <span class="italic">The Lake</span>, 1905), O'Donovan tried to continue his life as a writer-priest in London, but as a priest he had difficulty finding employment. In May 1908, bankrupt and &#145;out of sorts&#146;, by his own choice he unfrocked himself. His reformist impulses found a footing at Toynbee Hall in London's East End, where be became sub-warden in March 1910. Months later, while on summer holiday in Donegal, O'Donovan, 5 feet 9 inches tall, a balding, broad-shouldered man of thirty-nine (whose blue eyes under a heavy dark brow looked, H. G. Wells said, like two gun barrels from behind a hedge), met the tall Florence Emily Beryl Verschoyle (1886&#150;1968), the twenty-four-year-old daughter of an Irish protestant colonel. They were married in the Whitechapel register office on 15 October 1910. The couple moved out of Toynbee Hall in June 1911, before the birth of their first child, Brigid, in December. Two more children followed, Dermod (<i>b</i>. 1913) and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1918).<br>
<br>In O'Donovan's first and most famous novel, the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Father Ralph</span> (1913), the hero, Ralph O'Brien, is the single child of a Catholic Ascendancy family in Dublin with a big house in the country; his mother dedicates him to God and the priesthood while he is yet in the womb. Ralph's life is a sequence of excruciating disillusionments with the church but not with religion. The worst comes when Ralph is sent to serve under Father Tom Molloy, a cunning and lustful bully in league with the local gombeen man, a combination of shopkeeper, publican, usurer, middleman, and politician. They conspire to destroy every effort for the improvement of town life, including Father Ralph's Temperance Society. Working with the bishop (who has already extracted the title to the O'Brien estate from Ralph's widowed mother), Father Molloy drives Father Ralph out of town and the priesthood. Ralph takes off the clerical collar, and, puzzled, must learn once again how to tie a cravat.<br>
<br>The novel is remarkable for its varied gallery of priests, depicted alone and with one another. To judge from the indignation expressed in <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> (&#145;a grotesque libel!&#146;), and the delight in papers such as the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> (&#145;so accurate and so convincing&#146;), O'Donovan succeeded in settling scores with the hierarchy at the cost of giving hostages to unionists.<br>
<br>After the publication of his first novel O'Donovan used the forename Gerald instead of Jeremiah. His subsequent novels tend to repeat elements of <span class="italic">Father Ralph</span>&#151;the maleficent Father Molloy, for instance, turns up regularly under new names. The subject of <span class="italic">Waiting</span> (1914) is the difficulties undergone by an idealistic young schoolteacher who wishes to marry a protestant girl after the 1907 <span class="italic">Ne temere</span> decree which severely restricted mixed marriages.<br>
<br>By 1914 Gerald O'Donovan was a patriotic Englishman with a perfect accent (only the &#145;o&#146; in words like &#145;cook&#146; gave him trouble). Commissioned as first lieutenant in 1915, he became head of the Italian section of the Ministry of Information in 1918. There his secretary was the novelist Rose Macaulay [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34668/', "Macaulay, Dame (Emilie) Rose (1881&#150;1958)")</script>]; the two soon fell in love.<br>
<br>After the war, O'Donovan published <span class="italic">How They Did It</span> (1920), an expos&eacute; of wartime corruption; <span class="italic">Conquest</span> (1920), made up of dinner table conversations, and illustrating the conversion of its hero to Sinn F&eacute;in; <span class="italic">Vocations</span> (1921), about Irish postulants without true vocations; and, finally, <span class="italic">The Holy Tree</span> (1922), a poetical story of a love triangle in Irish peasant idiom, dedicated to Rose Macaulay. O'Donovan's secret, intimate relationship with Macaulay continued without breaking up his marriage. In 1939 the two were motoring in the Lake District towards Hadrian's Wall, when Macaulay drove into another vehicle. O'Donovan suffered a head injury, then a stroke. It was cancer that ended his life three years later on 26 July 1942 at his home, Church Lane Cottage, in Albury, Surrey; he was attended by his wife and two surviving children, Brigid and Dermod. He was buried three days later at Albury after an Anglican service.<br>
