</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scudamore,  Frank Ives</span>  (1823&#150;1884), <span class="occ">writer and Post Office administrator</span>, was born in February 1823 in Eltham, Kent, the son of John Scudamore, a solicitor from a prominent Herefordshire family, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Colonel Francis Downman. Educated at Christ's Hospital, he married, in 1851, Jane Ellen Moore Sherwin, daughter of a Greenwich surgeon.<br>
<br>An individual with a great appetite for work, Scudamore pursued two careers simultaneously. The first was as a writer of light pieces for <span class="italic">Punch</span>, the <span class="italic">Comic Times</span>, and other magazines as well as more serious works ranging from orthography to the Eastern question. But it was his second career as an activist civil servant, urging the expansion of the government into areas and pursuits previously considered neither ideologically acceptable nor fiscally appropriate for state action, which was the great cause of his life and the foundation of his historical significance. Scudamore joined the Post Office in 1840, the year of Rowland Hill's penny post, and the beginning of a fundamental reorientation of the department's role in Victorian society. Although Scudamore never served as a departmental surveyor and, therefore, was considered by some of his colleagues to lack necessary field experience, he advanced rapidly. By 1864 he had risen to the position of assistant secretary, having been chosen over his rival, Anthony Trollope, who had more years of service in the department. In 1868 he was named second secretary of the Post Office, and appeared well positioned for future promotions. But it was less his official job titles than the projects which he sponsored which made Scudamore arguably the most important civil servant in the entire government by the late 1860s.<br>
<br>The first of these projects was government-operated savings banks. Although Scudamore did not conceive the original idea for such a system, he became its most persuasive proponent. The banks, established in 1861 under Post Office direction, offered safe, efficient service and grew rapidly. By 1862 there were 180,000 accounts, and the system ultimately surpassed the Trustee Savings Banks in attracting deposits from the working and lower middle classes, its natural clientele. For Scudamore such results only confirmed his belief that government, in certain instances, could provide economic services more effectively than private initiative. This led him next to advocate the sale of life insurance and annuities through the Post Office. However, in this case the programme, instituted in 1864, never fulfilled Scudamore's projections. Fewer than 25,000 policies were sold between 1865 and 1884. In part this outcome resulted from the fact that certain schemes which Scudamore advocated for bringing the programme to the public's attention, such as government-organized lectures on the advantages of the department's system, were never implemented. In part, however, the programme failed because Scudamore underestimated the strength of competing alternatives offered by friendly societies and private firms.<br>
<br>Characteristically Scudamore did not waver in his faith in what he termed the &#145;co-operative society&#146;, in which technocrats such as himself would plan and control bureaucracies to ensure social harmony through low prices and efficient management. In 1865 Lord Stanley of Alderley, the postmaster-general, commissioned him to study the condition of the privately owned telegraph companies, and to consider the possible results of nationalization. Over the course of the next five years Scudamore became the great advocate of state take-over of the industry. He made detailed estimates of likely purchase costs and financial results. He lobbied leading politicians, such as W. E. Gladstone, on the wisdom of nationalization, and he formed alliances with Edward Taylor of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and Edwin Chadwick to rally public support. These efforts bore fruit in 1869 when parliament allocated &pound;7 million for telegraph purchase costs and capital improvements.<br>
<br>The next year Scudamore assumed direction of the Post Office telegraphs, and moved quickly to expand the system, now charging lower tariffs than under private management. In many ways Scudamore's optimistic predictions of the results of a nationalized system proved to be accurate. The average price of a telegram fell by 6<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. During the first year of government management, the number of telegrams sent increased by 3 million to almost 10 million. The public was without question pleased with the quality of service provided by Scudamore's department. However, certain problems arose to cloud the picture. For one, the system never fulfilled Scudamore's hopes for savings under centralized management. Wage costs escalated, as more employees at higher salaries than under the pre-1870 system were hired. Accordingly, the system also failed to meet Scudamore's net revenue (profit) projections, and usually incurred large losses. Neither was it clear that government management avoided the pitfalls of employee strife and maladministration, as Scudamore had claimed that it would. In 1871 a telegraphists' strike broke out, which although swiftly crushed still soured labour relations. More seriously, in 1873 it was revealed that Scudamore, in haste to expand a system which he regarded as virtually his own, had spent over &pound;800,000 without Treasury or parliamentary approval. In a crisis which disrupted Gladstone's government and which helped to establish the concept of ministerial responsibility, William Monsell, the postmaster-general, was forced to resign. Scudamore remained in office, but chafed under new restrictions on his independence until his resignation in 1875.<br>
<br>Scudamore then began a new life when he accepted the offer of the Ottoman government to reorganize the Turkish post office; and in 1877 the order of the Mejidiye was conferred on him. Not surprisingly, he found the pace of improvement in Turkey so slow that he retired, and then occupied his time writing. He died in Therapia in the Ottoman empire on 8 February 1884 and was buried in the English cemetery at Scutari, in the country where he had taken up a self-imposed exile.<br>
