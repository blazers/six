<span class="headword">Prest,  William</span>  (1830&#150;1885), <span class="occ">football administrator and wine merchant</span>, was born in York, probably on 1 April 1830, one of five sons of John Prest, a successful merchant in the city, and his wife, Arabella. He attended private schools in York from <i>c</i>.1840 to 1848. His father bought William's older brother John Beevor Prest into a partnership with a Sheffield wine merchant as Prest and Porter in 1850, and William Prest succeeded Porter in 1855. The business, which flourished, was continued by William after his brother's death, in partnership with E. C. Viner from London.<br>
<br>Prest was a keen cricketer&#151;a good batsman and a speedy fielder&#151;and attended in 1854 the meeting at which Bramall Lane was established as a venue for cricket. He played in the inaugural match the following year, but failed to score on that occasion. He also played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club. A talented athlete, he managed during an annual Sheffield sports day to carry off eleven prizes, one of which bore the inscription &#145;Toujours Prest&#146;.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Prest was best-known for his interest in the local rifle volunteers. In 1859 he helped to establish the Hallamshire volunteer rifle corps, joining as an ensign and second in command to his friend Nathaniel Creswick (1831&#150;1917). Before long he was promoted to the rank of major, and it was as Major Prest that he was generally known. In 1884, shortly before his death, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Prest came to be more widely remembered, however, for his part in the founding of Sheffield Football Club, later recognized as the first association football club of the modern era. According to Creswick's recollections, it was while he and Prest were taking a summer walk that the idea of a football club was discussed as a winter sport to complement cricket. They wrote to Cambridge University and those public schools known to play versions of football, asking for copies of their rules. These were used in drawing up their own code, which was confirmed at the inaugural meeting of Sheffield Football Club in October 1857 (the most widely accepted date of the club's formation). Creswick was duly elected honorary treasurer and secretary and Prest was also elected to a committee dominated by fellow businessmen and men from the professions. Opponents in the early years were thin on the ground before the formation of Hallam Football Club two years later; Prest played in one of the early matches between the two clubs in 1861.<br>
<br>In later years Prest's interest in football gave way to his business, the rifle volunteers, and politics. He was a member of the executive and finance committee of the Sheffield conservative and constitutional association, but according to an obituarist &#145;he was never accused of being an offensive politician&#146; since his views &#145;were always put temperately and with much good humour&#146;. Perhaps for this reason he made &#145;but a slight stir on the public affairs of the borough&#146;.<br>
<br>An Anglican&#151;his brother Edward Prest (1824&#150;1882) was archdeacon of Durham&#151;Prest never married. He died in Market Place, Sheffield, on 10 February 1885 at the age of fifty-four, his four brothers having predeceased him. Thanks to the range of his interests he was said to have had a wide circle of friends and, although a disciplinarian with the rifle volunteers, he was liked for his good humour and kindness. Perhaps his relaxed, tory, gentlemanly approach quickly became incompatible with the serious, often rigid puritanism of those who came to dominate Sheffield football in the late Victorian period; his business activities would not have endeared him to temperance militants in the local football world such as Charles Clegg. It would be an exaggeration to say that without Prest the history of the world's biggest sport would have been markedly different, but in his typical Victorian, voluntarist way Prest earned his place in the history of the game.<br>
