<span class="headword">Bonner,  Hypatia  Bradlaugh</span>  (1858&#150;1935), <span class="occ">freethinker and radical</span>, was born in London on 30 March 1858 at 3 Hedger's Terrace, Hackney, the second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3183/', "Charles Bradlaugh (1833&#150;1891)")</script>, politician and freethinker, and Susannah Lamb Hooper (<i>d</i>. 1877). Her elder sister, <a name="cosubject_47701"></a><span class="headword">Alice Bradlaugh</span>  (1856&#150;1888)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 30 April 1856 at 4 West Street, Bethnal Green, shared many of her early experiences and interests. They received a basic education at private schools in London, but learnt French from political refugees and in 1872 attended school briefly in Paris. However, after their parents' separation in 1870 most of their time was spent at their grandparents' home in Midhurst, Sussex, with their mother who suffered from alcoholism.<br>
<br>After Susannah Bradlaugh's death in 1877 the girls moved back to London to keep house for their father at 20 Circus Road, St John's Wood. He and Annie Besant were involved in the &#145;Knowlton pamphlet&#146; obscenity trial, and the daughters were kept fully occupied in his support, though they resented Mrs Besant's presumptuous attitude towards their father. During the early 1880s their principal contribution to secularism was at the Old Street Hall of Science, where Edward Aveling ran the secularists' school. Alice studied chemistry and animal physiology, and subsequently taught French and botany; Hypatia taught chemistry and mathematics, four of her lectures being published in 1882 as <span class="italic">Chemistry of Home</span>. In 1881 both sisters were recognized as teachers by the Department of Science and Art, and Hypatia subsequently passed the matriculation examinations for London University. Educational progress, though, was halted by prejudice. In 1877 the sisters had attended J. H. Levy's political economy classes at the City of London College, only for the college to close its doors to female students, and in 1883 Alice, along with Annie Besant, was refused admittance to botany classes at University College.<br>
<br>Among Hypatia's pupils at the Hall of Science was Arthur Bonner (1861&#150;1939), the son of a radical nonconformist minister. Following their engagement in January 1884 he was employed as Bradlaugh's printer, and they married at Marylebone register office on 18 June 1885. Shortly afterwards they took rooms with Annie Besant at 19 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, where Hypatia met many of the leading radical intellectuals of the day. A son, Kenneth, was born on 3 April 1886 but died on 22 September. Both Alice and Hypatia were active as freethought lecturers and contributors to the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span>, and in 1883 were elected vice-presidents of the National Secular Society. Hypatia also wrote for Annie Besant's <span class="italic">Our Corner</span> (1883&#150;8), some of her children's stories there being published separately in 1886. Alice's only published lecture was <span class="italic">Mind Considered as a Bodily Function</span> (1884), though she left several manuscripts of lectures. She died of meningitis and typhoid on 2 December 1888 at her sister's home and was buried at Brookwood necropolis, Woking, on 5 December.<br>
<br>Hypatia moved back to 20 Circus Road where a second son, Charles, was born on 28 April 1890. She acted as her father's secretary until his death in 1891 and then moved to 30 Victoria Road, Clapham Common, and again, in 1894 or 1895, to 23 Streathbourne Road, which was to be their final home. The months immediately after her father's death were spent arranging his papers, defending his reputation, and writing her two-volume <span class="italic">Charles Bradlaugh: a Record of his Life and Work</span> (1894). Arthur Bonner continued to manage the printing and publishing business in partnership with Hypatia, who inherited the plant and titles, including the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span>, to which she contributed regularly until declining circulation forced its closure in 1893.<br>
<br>Politically Hypatia was an advanced Liberal, advocating women's suffrage but later opposing the violence of the suffragettes. From March 1897 she edited her own monthly paper, <span class="italic">The Reformer</span>, but falling circulation during the South African War forced its closure in 1904. She lectured widely and served on the executives of the Women's National Liberal Federation, the International Arbitration and Peace League, and the Humanitarian League, for which she wrote an attack on the death penalty in 1905. She was, however, increasingly dissatisfied with G. W. Foote at the National Secular Society and in 1905 became a Rationalist Press Association lecturer, joining the board in 1916. In 1910 she was founder chair of the Rationalist Peace Society and also campaigned against the blasphemy laws, of which she wrote a history, <span class="italic">Penalties upon Opinion</span>, in 1912.<br>
<br>Hypatia remained a popular lecturer in Liberal and rationalist circles until 1924, when her voice failed. Despite the fact that she had suffered ill health since she was a child, she showed remarkable vigour through a long public career and remained active into old age, continuing to write and serving as a London magistrate from 1921 until 1934. She died at 23 Streathbourne Road, London, after an abdominal operation for cancer, on 25 August 1935 and was cremated at Golders Green on 28 August. Her ashes were then buried in her father's grave at Brookwood. She was a daughter worthy of her formidable father, whose reputation she tenaciously defended. Her own role in public affairs has been underestimated, not least because she expressed her radicalism and belief in equal status for women from within Liberalism rather than through the more publicized suffragette movement.<br>
