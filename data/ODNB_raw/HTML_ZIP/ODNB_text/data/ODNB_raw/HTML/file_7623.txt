<span class="headword">Dickson,  William Steel</span>  (1744&#150;1824), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and political radical</span>, was born William Dickson on Christmas day 1744, the eldest son of John Dickson, farmer, and his wife, Jane Steel, at Ballycraigy, in the parish of Carnmoney, co. Antrim. Following the death, on 13 May 1747, of his uncle William Steel he was given the additional name of Steel. Having received a grounding in classics, logic, metaphysics, morals, and natural theology from the Revd Robert White of Templepatrick he matriculated from Glasgow University in 1763. He was received on &#145;trial&#146; by Templepatrick presbytery on 20 January 1766 and licensed on 8 April 1767. This presbytery had abolished subscription to the Westminster confession and so Dickson was not required to subscribe. Four years later, on 6 March 1771, he was ordained by Killyleagh presbytery at Ballyhalbert and, as this presbytery was also non-subscription, he was not required to sign the confession. Soon after his ordination he &#145;became an husband and a farmer&#146;  (Dickson, <span class="italic">A Narrative</span>, 7). His wife, Isabella McMinn (<i>d</i>. 1819), whom he married on 21 August 1771, came from a &#145;genteel family, brought up in affluence and liberally educated&#146;  (ibid., 7). They had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Dickson first entered the political arena when he denounced the war with the American colonies as &#145;unnatural, impolitic and unprincipled&#146;  (Dickson, <span class="italic">A Narrative</span>, 7). During the conflict the government appointed two general fast days. On 13 December 1776 Dickson spoke to his congregation on &#145;The advantages of national repentance&#146;, and on 27 February 1778 on &#145;The ruinous effects of civil war&#146;; both sermons were published later that year and caused considerable offence to those who sympathized with the British government. For his part Dickson defended his stance: &#145;If we have, in any instance censured the principle or conduct of the war &hellip; [it] has been justified by the general feelings of humanity, and a zealous concern for the common interests of Britain and America&#146;  (W. S. Dickson, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 1778, 58). Alexander Gordon has suggested that it was Dickson's radical politics that caused a portion of his congregation to secede and build a new church at Kircubbin in 1777. But a remonstrance presented to the synod of Ulster by commissioners from neighbouring congregations of Greyabbey and Portaferry maintained that the Kircubbin seceders had not separated &#145;on account of any religious concern, matter of or objection against the conduct or ministry of Mr Dixon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod of Ulster</span>, 2.588).<br>
<br>When the volunteers were raised with government approval in 1778 to meet a possible French invasion Dickson was an enthusiastic supporter. On 28 March 1779 he delivered a sermon to the Echlinville Company, entitled &#145;The propriety and advantages of acquiring the knowledge and use of arms in times of public danger&#146;. In his address he deplored the exclusion of Catholics from the movement. The effect of his remarks was &#145;to offend all the Protestant and Presbyterian bigots in the country&#146;  (Dickson, <span class="italic">A Narrative</span>, 10), but the general tenor of the sermon was approved as promoting the volunteer cause.<br>
<br>Dickson preached at Portaferry on 14 November 1779 on the occasion of the death of its pastor, the Revd James Armstrong. His address so impressed his hearers that he was invited to fill the vacant pulpit. He accepted, resigned his charge at Ballyhalbert on 1 February 1780, and was installed at Portaferry by Killyleagh presbytery on 6 March. There he opened an academy from which he derived about &pound;100 per annum. In 1781 he was appointed to preach the annual sermon at synod. In 1784 Glasgow University conferred on him a doctorate in divinity.<br>
<br>When Robert Stewart, later first marquess of Londonderry, stood for re-election to parliament as MP for County Down in 1783 Dickson devoted a considerable amount of time, labour, and purse to further Stewart's cause against the marquess of Downshire's interest, but in vain. However, at the 1790 parliamentary election Stewart's son Robert, the future Lord Castlereagh, was successful, and again Dickson was prominent in the election campaign. His political commitment to the Stewarts, who were independent whigs, stemmed from their championing of the dissenting interest in the county.<br>
<br>The Society of United Irishmen was founded at Belfast in October 1791. Dickson took the &#145;test&#146; early in December but apparently did not attend any further meetings, although he later admitted that he was often in their company. He was present at the volunteer rally in Belfast on 14 July 1792 to mark the third anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. Aided by two ministerial colleagues, Thomas Ledlie Birch of Saintfield and Sinclaire Kelburn of Belfast, he strongly challenged a proposal calling for the gradual emancipation of Catholics; consequently a proposal for total and immediate emancipation was overwhelmingly adopted. In the same year he published a small pamphlet, <span class="italic">Psalmody an Address to the Presbyterian Congregations of the Synod of Ulster</span>, issued with the approbation of nine presbyteries.<br>
<br>At a volunteer convention at Dungannon, co. Tyrone, on 15 and 16 February 1793 Dickson supported radical resolutions such as that calling for Catholic emancipation. So impressive was his oratory that he was invited to preach in the local meeting-house on the Sunday afterwards. A crowded church heard him expound Joseph's advice to his brethren: &#145;See that ye fall not out by the way&#146;  (<span class="roman">Genesis</span> 45: 24). A few weeks later he published his celebrated <span class="italic">Three Sermons on the Subject of Scripture Politics</span>, in which he argued forcibly for the need and enforcement of reform and emancipation on biblical grounds. In June he was elected moderator of synod, which congratulated their Roman Catholic countrymen on their regaining of the franchise under the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> of April 1793. His stance on reform, however, caused many families in the Portaferry congregation to withdraw from his ministry. Spurred on by the dissension Dickson used every effort to regain the confidence of the disaffected; the church committee marked his success with a presentation &#145;for the services he had rendered to the congregation&#146;  (Portaferry congregation MSS, 24 Oct 1793).<br>
<br>Little is known about Dickson's activities during 1794 and 1795 and most of 1796. There was some civil unrest among the Presbyterians and Catholics in the upper Ards district which he sought to resolve, only to find that charges of sedition were directed against him for his pains. His detractors contended that he occupied these years preaching inflammable and seditious sermons. In the autumn of 1796 the government, alarmed by rumours that the French were about to invade Ireland, arrested a number of leading northern United Irishmen. Several members of Dickson's congregation were detained and efforts were made to obtain evidence of his involvement in the United Irishmen's plot to overthrow the government. One of those arrested, a man named Carr, was offered &pound;1000 to provide information leading to Dickson's conviction, but his testimony was judged unreliable.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1797 Dickson was summoned by the defence to attend the co. Antrim assizes at Carrickfergus to impeach the character of the chief prosecution witness, Bell (or Belle) Martin (originally from Portaferry), at the trial of a United Irishman. He attended a meeting of co. Down magistrates and gentlemen at Ballynahinch in May and endorsed the resolution &#145;not to relax in our exertions by any legal and constitutional means to obtain a full and adequate representation of the people of Ireland without regard to differences of religious opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, 15 May 1797). At the summer assizes in Downpatrick, Dickson&#151;along with J. Philpot Curran&#151;persuaded the attorney-general to release the Portaferry prisoners. In the latter part of the year illness confined him to the manse.<br>
<br>In March&#150;April 1798, the year of the Irish rising, Dickson visited Scotland, and on return his baggage was searched at Portaferry but no incriminating documents were found. In May he was active, attending to sacramental duties in parts of co. Down and visiting friends in Belfast. It has been alleged that he agreed to accept the post of adjutant-general for the United Irishmen of co. Down around this time. He was arrested, on the orders of Lord Annesley, at Ballynahinch on 5 June, some days before the outbreak of the rising in co. Down, and was taken to Lisburn before being transferred to Belfast, where he was detained in various prisons until 25 March 1799. Having been put on board a ship he and other important United Irish prisoners sailed for Scotland and were conveyed overland to Fort George, near Inverness, where they arrived on 9 April. During Dickson's incarceration government officials in Belfast made strenuous efforts to obtain sufficient evidence to indict him. Two United Irishmen-turned-informers were offered inducements to confirm that he was appointed adjutant-general by the co. Down colonels in May 1798 but they refused to testify in open court. Later Dickson was offered his liberty on condition of his emigrating to a foreign country. He insisted on being brought to court and tried, but to no avail. Having been confined for over three years he was taken back to Belfast and released on 13 January 1802.<br>
<br>At first Dickson contemplated emigrating to America but, aware that this would be taken as evidence of his guilt, he decided to remain. Efforts to have him installed as minister at Donegore, co. Antrim, failed, as it was implied that payment of the <i>regium donum</i> would not be granted in his case because of his alleged connection to the rising. He attended the meetings of synod in 1802 and, as he did not have a congregation, he was received as an honorary member. He was installed in the newly formed congregation of Second Keady, co. Armagh, on 24 March 1803. As his installation service did not involve signing the confession some members of Tyrone presbytery moved that he should not be admitted unless he subscribed. Since this was not the majority view of presbytery he was accordingly received. His stipend was fixed at &pound;50 without the <i>regium donum</i> and so his congregation petitioned synod for a share of the <i>regium donum</i> but this was rejected in 1804 and again in 1805. In response Dickson submitted a memorial requiring synod to state explicitly whether or not it had been referred to in a minute of 1799 that he was &#145;implicated in treasonable or seditious practices&#146; in 1798  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod of Ulster</span>, 3.302). His memorial was summarily dismissed, at which he &#145;entreated the Moderator to hear him one word, [and] laying his hand upon his breast, he pronounced with great emphasis, &#147;Farewell for ever&#148;!, and left the house&#146;  (Black, 8). He absented himself from synod in 1806 but returned in 1807 and remained until 1810, without making any reference to his complaint.<br>
<br>At synod in 1811 Dickson obtained permission to use synodical documents for the forthcoming publication of his narrative of his life. He took part in the speeches at a Catholic dinner in Dublin on 9 May and was probably the first Presbyterian parson ever to address a wholly Catholic gathering. He also spoke at a Catholic meeting in Armagh on 9 September; on his way home to Keady he was waylaid and assaulted. His <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, published in May 1812, caused a major storm at synod. The members, led by the Revd Dr Robert Black, declared that the work &#145;contained a number of gross misstatements and misrepresentations, highly injurious to the reputation of the ministers of this body&#146; and demanded a public retraction  (<span class="italic">Records of the General Synod of Ulster</span>, 3.383). Dickson refused to put his signature to an apology prepared by synod. The immediate reaction was to suspend him <i>ab officio</i>, which was later amended to postponement for a year to allow him to retract. Dickson used the time to publish what he facetiously termed <span class="italic">Retractations</span>, which was an attack on Black's criticism of him. This led to a reappraisal of Dickson's situation by synod in 1813. The Revd William Porter and the Revd Henry Montgomery questioned whether the minute of 1799 had been accurate, and it was agreed that the words as applied to Dickson had been inaccurately used. However, an apology from him regarding certain statements made in his <span class="italic">Narrative</span> relative to the synod was demanded. Dickson later handed in a paper purporting to be an apology but this was refused as inadequate and synod decided to dismiss the whole subject. His last political appearance was at a meeting of Catholics at Newry on 19 October 1813. He did not intend to address the gathering but responded to a &#145;general cry from every quarter&#146; to speak. He did so &#145;amidst expressions of the most unbounded applause&#146;  (&#145;Proceedings at public meetings&#146;, 400, 403).<br>
<br>Increasing infirmity caused Dickson to resign from Second Keady on 27 June 1815. He retired to Belfast and was forced to depend on the support of friends to provide him with accommodation and a weekly allowance. In 1817 he published a book of fifteen sermons, which did not alleviate his financial situation. His wife died on 15 July 1819, and a small annuity ceased with her death. As a member of the synod's committee Dickson attended the public examinations of theological students from 1821 to 1824. He died in Belfast on 27 December 1824 and was buried in a pauper's grave in Clifton Street cemetery, at which the Revd W. D. H. McEwen delivered a panegyric to a small group of mourners.<br>
