<span class="headword">Warburton,  Rowland Eyles  Egerton</span>  (1804&#150;1891), <span class="occ">fox-hunter and poet</span>, was born on 14 September 1804 at Norley Bank, Cheshire, the eldest son of the Revd Rowland Egerton (1778&#150;1846), who added the name Warburton by royal licence on 10 August 1813, and his wife, Emma (1782&#150;1881), daughter of John Croxton of Norley Bank, Cheshire, and his wife, Emma (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Warburton). Rowland Egerton Warburton's mother was heir to the estates of Sir Peter Warburton, fifth baronet, and on the baronet's death in 1813 Rowland succeeded to the Arley and Warburton estates. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28676/', "Peter Egerton Warburton")</script> was an explorer in Australia. <br>
<br>Rowland Egerton Warburton was educated at Eton College and was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in February 1823, though there is no evidence that he proceeded to a degree. On leaving Oxford he did the grand tour, returning to an active life as squire of Arley Hall, which he substantially rebuilt at a cost exceeding &pound;10,000. Egerton Warburton was born into a county steeped in hunting lore and tradition and rode to hounds from an early age, riding with the oldest surviving hunt club in England, the Tarporley Hunt Club (founded 1762), of which he was elected a member in 1825 and president in 1838. He also hunted with the Cheshire hounds. On retiring from active fox-hunting in 1873 he was elected an honorary member of the Tarporley Club, an honour of which he was most proud.<br>
<br>As squire of Arley, Egerton Warburton was very active in local life, being an ardent high-churchman and tory. Throughout his life he attended choral matins in the chapel at Arley Hall, wearing his hunting red on hunt days. He was, to quote his friend Samuel Wilberforce (1805&#150;1873), bishop of Oxford and later Winchester, equally at home in the hunting field and the parish church. His politics were passive, though his long friendship with his neighbour W. E. Gladstone nearly foundered on the latter's disestablishment of the Irish church in 1869. He served as a JP and as high sheriff of Cheshire in 1833.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1831 Egerton Warburton married Mary Brooke (1810?&#150;1881), eldest daughter of Sir Richard Brooke, sixth baronet, of Norton Priory. The marriage produced three children, a son and heir, Piers (1839&#150;1914), and two daughters, Mary Alice (<i>d</i>. 1901) and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1923). After the death of his wife in 1881, his younger daughter, Mary, and her family lived with him. Egerton Warburton's social background and education provided the perfect basis for his reputation as a poet of the hunting field, and he was known as the poet laureate of the Tarporley Hunt Club. He wrote verses for pleasure and for the enjoyment of his fellow huntsmen, and his <span class="italic">Hunting Songs</span>, first published in 1834, ran to eight editions in his lifetime. His style was humorous and jolly, reflecting the close social companionship of the hunt. Titles such as &#145;A Good Merry Gallop for Me!&#146;, &#145;Hard-riding Dick&#146;, &#145;Tarporley Hunting Song, 1870&#146;, and &#145;Farmer Dobbin&#146; give an idea as to subject matter. His &#145;Quaesitum meritis&#146;, a nine-stanza poem, encapsulates the hunting man and his calling and shows Egerton Warburton at his best. His poetical output was not extensive, however, and was limited to hunting and archery. Apart from his verse he published documents on the cattle plague of 1747&#150;9.<br>
<br>Egerton Warburton suffered from glaucoma in 1874 and within a year was blind. This was a severe blow to a man of the countryside, but he still walked, being led by his gardener Peter Burgess on a leather strap. This was not enough, so he had a Furlong Walk constructed from wire along the terrace at Arley. From 1888 his health failed and he died on 6 December 1891. He was buried in the family vault at St Mary and All Saints Church, Great Budworth, Cheshire, on 10 December 1891.<br>
