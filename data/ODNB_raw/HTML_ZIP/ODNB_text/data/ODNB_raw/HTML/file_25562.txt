<span class="headword">Symon Simeonis</span> <span class="st"> [Symon Semeonis]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1322&#150;1324), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar, traveller, and author</span>, was from Ireland, probably of Anglo-Irish origin. In 1323&#150;4 he undertook a journey from Ireland to the Holy Land which he describes in his <span class="italic">Itinerarium Symon Semeonis ab Hybernia ad Terram Sanctam</span>. The work survives in a firsthand copy written between 1335 and 1352, in which his second name, perhaps a patronym, is spelt Semeonis. This manuscript (now MS 407 in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge) very soon came into the possession of, if it was not written for, Simon Bozoun, prior of Norwich from 1344 to 1352. Symon's work is an important source for European contacts with the Near East at the time, giving information on distances, prices, religion, the value of money, and the customs of the people through whose lands Symon's party passed. Throughout his journey Symon's greatest interest was aroused by the holy sites, especially shrines of saints, that he visited.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Itinerarium</span> tells how, having attended the Franciscan provincial chapter held at Clonmel on 4 October 1322, Symon left Ireland in the company of Hugh Illuminator (le Luminour) on 16 March 1323, and landed in Anglesey. They journeyed through England to Dover, on to Paris and down the Rh&ocirc;ne to Nice, by sea to Genoa, and thence to Venice, where they stayed for seven weeks. Sailing then through the Adriatic they arrived in Candia (Crete), where Symon encountered Gypsies&#151;the earliest datable record of the people in Europe. With the arrival of the party in Egypt, at Alexandria, on 10 October 1323, Symon's field of observation widens as he describes the economic and social conditions of the mameluke sultanate. Having gained permission from the authorities, the party travelled to Cairo. Here Symon's companion Hugh contracted dysentery and died, much to Symon's distress. He was buried in the church of St Martin in Old Cairo. Despite his relatively close contact with Muslims during this period, Symon's account of their beliefs is often mistaken, and includes inaccurate citations from the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, probably drawn from one of the unreliable Latin translations then in circulation.<br>
<br>Symon obtained a passport from the sultan's officials, which authorized him to travel freely throughout Egypt and Palestine, and to visit the holy places without the payment of the ordinary dues. Symon and his party set out from Cairo across the desert to Gaza, and thence to Jerusalem, which they probably reached on 9 or 10 December 1323. They seem to have remained there for about seven weeks. The <span class="italic">Itinerarium</span> gives a detailed description of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, which closely resembles that in other pilgrim narratives, and of other landmarks in the city, before breaking off. From references in the text, it can be surmised that Symon was back in Cairo by 2 February 1324, had reached Alexandria by 4 March, and visited Rome on his way home. Any account of the homeward journey was, however, lost before the scribe of the surviving copy set to work. Of Symon, nothing more is known. His <span class="italic">Itinerarium</span> was first published by James Nasmith in 1778; a critical edition appeared in 1960.<br>
