<span class="headword">Dredge,  James</span>  (1840&#150;1906), <span class="occ">civil engineer and journalist</span>, was born in Bath on 29 July 1840, the younger son of James Dredge and his wife, Anne Vine. The elder James Dredge was an engineer who designed and patented a form of suspension bridge with inclined suspension rods carrying the roadway. The younger James's elder brother, William, under whom he served articles, was also an engineer. After education at Bath grammar school Dredge spent three years (1858&#150;61) in the office of D. K. Clark; in 1862 he entered the office of John Fowler, and was engaged for several years in London on work connected with the Metropolitan District Railway. However, Dredge soon gave up practical engineering for engineering journalism. From the start in January 1866 of the weekly periodical <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, which was founded by Zerah Colburn on his retirement from the editorship of <span class="italic">The Engineer</span> in 1865, Dredge helped in illustrating and occasionally wrote for the paper. On Colburn's death in 1870 Dredge and W. H. Maw, the sub-editor, became joint editors and proprietors. Dredge helped actively in the management until May 1903, when he was disabled by paralysis. He published several books on technical subjects, which mainly derived from his writings in <span class="italic">Engineering</span>.<br>
<br>Dredge was keenly interested in international exhibitions. He described for his journal those at Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876), and Paris (1878 and 1889), publishing his reports of the first and last in book form. He was also officially connected as a British commissioner with exhibitions at Chicago (1893), Antwerp (1894), Brussels (1897), and Milan (1906). For services at Paris in 1889 he was appointed an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and for his work at Brussels he was made CMG in 1898.<br>
<br>As a close friend of the American engineer Alexander Lyman Holley he delivered an address in Chickering Hall, New York, on 2 October 1890, at the installation of a bronze bust of Holley in Washington Square, New York. He was also elected in 1886 an honorary member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 4 February 1896, and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1874, and was a member of the council of the Society of Arts (1890&#150;93). In 1901 he founded, as a monthly supplement to <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, a journal called <span class="italic">Traction and Transmission</span>, which he edited with much care until it ceased in 1904. Dredge died at Pinner Wood Cottage, Pinner, Middlesex, on 15 August 1906. He was long a widower; an only child, Marie Louise, survived him.<br>
