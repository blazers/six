<span class="headword">Lowndes,  William Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1793, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was baptized at St Luke's, Chelsea, on 8 December 1793, the son of William Lowndes (1753?&#150;1823), bookseller at 77 Fleet Street and Bedford Street, Covent Garden, and his wife, Mary Ann. He came from a well-known bookselling family, originally from Cheshire, of which several members were liverymen of the Stationers' Company. His grandfather Thomas Lowndes and his father were noted dramatic publishers; his cousin Henry Lowndes recovered from bankruptcy to become a prosperous bookseller and Stationers' Company court assistant. W. T. Lowndes was apprenticed to his father at Stationers' Hall on 7 July 1807 and freed on 8 September 1814, but not admitted to the livery. On 11 October 1828 he married Susan Cooper at St Paul's, Covent Garden. They had two children, one of whom, a daughter, was born in 1830. Lowndes may well have scratched a living as a freelance cataloguer but little is known of his life up to its last few years. In January 1841 he wrote applying for relief to the Royal Literary Fund. It was a charity that at that time insisted on its pensioners possessing moral probity as well as literary merit, and Lowndes hoped to conceal from its committee his &#145;one great offence committed many years ago&#146; which had been &#145;within the knowledge of everybody connected with literary affairs in the metropolis&#146;  (P. Hall, letter of apology, Royal Literary Fund). In 1833 Lowndes had &#145;sold &pound;300 worth of books from the collection of Richard Heber, which had been placed in his hands to be catalogued&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 10th ser., 12, 1909, 228). He apparently asked his three sponsors, who included the well-known booksellers Thomas Rodd and Henry Stevens, to speak only of his penury and the worth of <span class="italic">The Bibliographers' Manual</span> but the book theft came to the ears of the committee and the appeal was rejected as &#145;unworthy of consideration&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund). Lowndes removed his letter of application and the biographical information it would have contained. There is no other evidence of shiftiness, yet it is strange that a young man of twenty-seven, in 1820, should have had the leisure to embark on a bibliography designed to supplement &#145;in relation to <i>British</i> literature&#146;  (Lowndes, 1834, i) Brunet's <span class="italic">Manuel du libraire</span>. He was known within the trade for his &#145;bibliographical drudgery&#146;, encouraged by booksellers and collectors alike, and was, perhaps, accounted so brilliant a cataloguer that booksellers would be prepared to risk losing a few books by employing him. Bibliophiles such as Richard Heber and Thomas Grenville offered him the use of their libraries. Thomas Rodd &#145;especially gave constant advice and useful suggestions&#146;  (Lowndes, 1834, xii) and put the first and no longer extant edition of <span class="italic">The Bibliographer's Manual</span> in fifteen parts (1828&#150;32) on his 1832 catalogue. After publication of the <span class="italic">Manual</span> Lowndes &#145;designed to supplement&#146; his &#145;defective treatment of theology&#146; by compiling <span class="italic">The British Librarian</span> (1839&#150;42). He was &#145;confident&#146;, he told the Royal Literary Fund, &#145;that when completed its sale would sufficiently remunerate&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund) him, but he was by then &#145;so dogged by ill health, mental instability and failing eyesight&#146;  (ibid.) that the work was published in an incomplete form. At the end of his life Lowndes lodged at 4 Calthorpe Place, Gray's Inn Road. He spent his last years working for Bohn as a cataloguer, but in his employer's words:<blockquote>his long course of bibliographical drudgery had reduced him, both in body and mind, to a mere wreck of his former self &hellip; and in his own history he realised a fact, of which he was always conscious, that Bibliography has no recognised status in England. (Bohn, appx V)</blockquote>He died in London on 31 July 1843.<br>
<br>Lowndes's posthumous fame rests on <span class="italic">The Bibliographer's Manual</span> (1834), the first systematic work of its kind. At the close of the twentieth century this was still a standard bibliographical reference tool, particularly useful to librarians and bibliophiles for its details of provenance. It was an attempt to produce a bibliographical manual for the whole of English literature on the pattern of Watt's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Britannica</span>. After Lowndes's death Bohn expanded it to 6 volumes (1858&#150;68). In an eminently respectable book trade family, he appears to have been the black sheep.<br>
