<span class="headword">Joel,  Betty</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Stewart Lockhart]</span>  (1894&#150;1985), <span class="occ">furniture and interior designer</span>, was born on 7 June 1894 in Hong Kong, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63594/', "Sir James Haldane Stewart Lockhart KCMG, LLD (1858&#150;1937)")</script>, colonial secretary and dedicated collector of Chinese art, and his wife, Edith Louise Rider, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hancock (1870&#150;1950), daughter of a bullion broker. She attended Miss Weisse's school, Northlands, Englefield Green, Surrey, between the ages of nine and sixteen and her education was completed with a governess. In 1918 Mary Stewart Lockhart married David Joel (1890&#150;1973), a naval lieutenant (later commander) in Ceylon and they returned to England. She stated  (Patmore, 276) that she began designing furniture for her own modern house, then began accepting commissions from friends. She and her husband set up a small furniture making business, Betty Joel Ltd, at Hayling Island, Hampshire, in 1921. She had been calling herself Betty since 1907 and this name was adopted for the firm as it was thought to convey a modern feeling and to appeal to female customers.<br>
<br>Neither Betty nor David Joel had received any training in design and, early on, she assumed responsibility for design while he administered the business. Betty Joel had a confident and assertive personality but was happy to take advice from the craftsmen they employed. Their employees often had a background in boatbuilding and fitting, reflected in the simplified arts and crafts style of the early furniture. This range was named Token furniture, after the two woods, teak and oak, which were predominantly used in its manufacture. It was retailed through a showroom at 177 Sloane Street in London, which, as the business developed, was moved to 25 Knightsbridge, also the Joels' home. This property included an art gallery where they exhibited both abstract paintings and modern carpets, some of which were designed by Betty Joel and manufactured in China. The factory was moved to larger premises in Portsmouth in 1929. The solidity and simplicity of the early furniture was replaced by greater sophistication as Betty Joel drew inspiration from a range of sources, including Chinese furniture, European modernism, and French art deco. The hallmarks of Joel furniture through the 1930s were extensive use of exotic woods and curvilinear shapes.<br>
<br>Individual clients of Betty Joel Ltd included Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Mountbatten, and the duchess of York, but the firm also produced a more moderately priced furniture range and worked for corporate bodies such as the Savoy and Claridges hotels, Fortnum and Mason, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Gaumont cinemas. She ventured into product design in the 1930s, designing an Esse stove for Smith and Wellstood Ltd of Bonnybridge and radio cabinets for K-B (Kolster-Brandes) Radio Company. Such a range indicates Betty Joel's popular success, but her work was often criticized by the modernists of the architectural press for indulging her taste for exotic materials and not being sufficiently concerned with function. Her prizewinning circular bed, designed for the British Art in Industry exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1935, was described by Herbert Read as having been &#145;twisted and contorted into a shape which I can only compare to a dislocated hip-bath&#146;  (Read, 48). Joel's spirited defence of her designs formed part of her extensive writings in the design press. Her support of modern architecture was demonstrated by commissioning H. S. Goodhart-Rendel to design a new factory at Kingston upon Thames in 1935.<br>
<br>Between 1937 and 1939 the Joels' marriage failed and the factory was briefly transferred to David Joel. It closed down during the Second World War. Betty Joel retired to Scotland and resumed her maiden name. Her retirement in her mid-forties and later reluctance to talk about her career have resulted in the neglect of her achievements by design historians, if not collectors. In her former husband's books on modern furniture design the only image of her is of a portrait head. Betty Joel's final years were spent at Fotheringay, a bungalow in Berkshire which she designed. She died in a nursing home, Millway House, near Andover, Hampshire, on 21 January 1985. Some examples of her furniture and carpets are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
