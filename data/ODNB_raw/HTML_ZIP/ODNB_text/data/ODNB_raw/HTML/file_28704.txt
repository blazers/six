<span class="headword">Ward,  Samuel</span>  (1577&#150;1640), <span class="occ">preacher</span>, was born in Haverhill, Suffolk, the eldest of three sons of John Ward (<i>d</i>. 1598), lecturer successively of Haverhill, Writtle, and Bury St Edmunds, and Susan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1639), his wife; his younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28700/', "Nathaniel Ward (1578&#150;1652)")</script> and John (<i>d</i>. 1661). After her husband's death in October 1598 Susan Ward married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23995/', "Richard Rogers (1551&#150;1618)")</script>, lecturer at Wethersfield near Sudbury, taking on two older stepsons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23970/', "Daniel Rogers (1573&#150;1652)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23972/', "Ezekiel Rogers (1588&#150;1660)")</script>; she was still living there in 1639. In November 1594 Samuel was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, a scholar on Lord Burghley's nomination. He graduated BA in 1597, was a founder fellow at Sidney Sussex College in 1599, and proceeded MA the next year. Like his brothers and stepbrothers, he entered the ministry. Ordained in June 1601, he was for a time lecturer at Haverhill, where his sermon on the calling of Zaccheus converted the eight-year-old Samuel Fairclough. Ward vacated his fellowship on marrying a clergyman's widow, Deborah Bolton (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Leech) (<i>d</i>. 1652), at Isleham, Cambridgeshire, on 2 January 1604, taking on two stepsons, John and Robert Bolton.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1605 Ward was appointed town preacher of Ipswich, preaching up to three times a week to the assembled corporation in St Mary-le-Tower Church while business in the town was suspended. His generous stipend, which over five years increased from &pound;67 to &pound;100 a year, and the house provided for him (19&#150;21 Lower Brook Street today), are two measures of his standing in the town. In 1607 he took a BD. As Thomas Fuller says, &#145;he was preferred minister in, or rather, of, Ipswich, having a care over and a love from all the parishes in that populous place&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 70&#150;71). He believed, and was not afraid to state from the pulpit, that those who held office in church and state should be puritans, which led to complaints that he interfered in parliamentary elections. He quickly took control of the grammar school, hiring and firing schoolmasters, and planning to divert the endowments to a charity school. From 1612 Ward was given funds and the former dorter of the Blackfriars for a library for his own and other preachers' use, the schoolmasters acting as librarians. More than 100 donors, knights, gentlemen, corporation members, ministers, and townsmen, gave money or books, and the collection survives into the twentieth-first century substantially complete, in which Ward's hand effacing crosses and references to historical characters as saints may still be seen.<br>
<br>Following what was to be the first of many publications, <span class="italic">A Coal from the Altar to Kindle the Holy Fire of Zeal</span> (1615), and his first sermon at Paul's Cross, issued as <span class="italic">Balm from Gilead to Recover Conscience</span> (1617), Ward began to exert more than local influence. Consciousness of the importance of a minister's public role is evident in his <span class="italic">Jethro's Justice of Peace</span> (1618), preached at Bury St Edmunds assizes, in which he emphasized the mutuality of magistracy and ministry&#151;&#145;the principal lights&#146;, &#145;these two opticke pieces&#146;, &#145;guardians and tutors&#146; of the people. In the preface to his <span class="italic">The Happiness of Practice</span> (1621) he explained that, in expounding half the scriptures to his hearers, he had &#145;endeavoured to acquaint you with the whole counsel of God; and what is now the top of all my ambition, but to make you doers of what you have been hearers&#146;. In 1621 he rashly allowed an engraving to be published from Amsterdam inscribed &#145;Invented by Samuell Ward, Preacher of Ipswich&#146;  (BM, Prints and Drawings, DG41, formerly Satires 41). It shows, on the left, the Armada in the grip of a storm, on the right, Gunpowder Plot discovered, and in a central pavilion the pope and his cardinals conferring with the king of Spain, the devil presiding. The Spanish ambassador Gondomar, at the time negotiating a match between Charles, prince of Wales and the Spanish infanta, claimed that this insulted his royal master. After examination by the privy council, Ward was committed to the Fleet. His petition to the king in April 1621 claimed that the &#145;embleme was &hellip; composed &hellip; five yeeres since&#146; (probably during earlier overtures from Spain), and that he sent it to the printer &#145;nigh a yeere since&#146;, &#145;coupling the two grand blessings of God to this nation &hellip; without anie sinister intencion &hellip; of meddling in any of your Majesties secrett affaires&#146;  (Bruce, 1&#150;2). He promised to be more cautious in future and only designed title-pages for his published sermons, most notably that of his anecdotal <span class="italic">Woe to Drunkards</span> (1622).<br>
<br>In 1622 Ward again pleaded for his liberty so that he could maintain his wife and eight children by continuing to preach in Ipswich. He was successful in this, but that August the bailiffs received a letter from the king, demanding that they &#145;inhibite Mr Ward from preaching the lecture&#146;  (Suffolk RO, Ipswich, great court book, 6 Aug 1622). Bishop Samuel Harsnett of Norwich took up the charges of nonconformity against him in his own consistory court, but Ward again appealed to the king, who referred the matter to Lord Keeper John Williams. Williams decided that Ward, though not altogether blameless, was easily won over by fair dealing, and persuaded Harsnett to accept Ward's submission and not to suspend him. Ward was loyal to the church, providing that it resisted what he regarded as corruption; allegations at the time that he stirred up feelings against the king's favourite, Buckingham, were never substantiated, and his general loyalty to the crown is evident in <span class="italic">A Peace Offering to God for the Blessings we Enjoy under his Majesties Reign</span> (1624). He reluctantly allowed nine of his sermons to be printed and sold, and the first collected edition appeared in 1627.<br>
<br>For two periods Ward was incumbent at the Tower church in Ipswich, as well as preacher, but between 1627 and 1630 a conformist minister, Jonathan Skinner, held the cure, and was well placed to collect Ward's public indiscretions for later use. Once William Laud became archbishop of Canterbury in 1633, there was less scope for compromise. His commissary and agent in the town, Dr Henry Dade, soon found an ally in Skinner, and in February 1634 reported to Laud that two ships with 160 emigrants were ready to leave Ipswich for New England, and that, &#145;Of the breeders of these persons Mr Ward is chief of those parts has caused this giddiness&#146;. However, because Ward was &#145;very potent in London and about Ipswich&#146;, it was recommended that Timothy Dalton, parson of Woolverstone (4 miles down the Orwell), &#145;a great stickler for transporting these people&#146;, be examined instead  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1633&#150;4</i>, 450). None the less, that November Ward faced forty-three articles requiring answers in the court of high commission; they were eventually reduced to eleven. He had to make many journeys to London over the next year, and sometimes failed to appear. His preaching against set prayers, devotional attitudes, bowing at the name of Jesus, the real presence, and the like, for stating that religion and the gospel &#145;stood on tiptoes ready to be gone&#146;, were some of the grounds for complaint  (ibid., <i>1635&#150;6</i>, lii). On 26 November 1635 he was ordered to be removed from office and suspended from all ministry, to pay &pound;50 costs (his delay was contempt), and to admit his offences in writing. This he was prepared to do only in his own words, and he was committed temporarily to the Gatehouse prison at Westminster.<br>
<br>Ward's reputation in Ipswich was greatly enhanced, and the townsmen refused to replace him, hoping in vain that the authorities would eventually relent. Matthew Wren, newly appointed bishop of Norwich, was intent on cleansing the town of puritan dissent, but underestimated the risk of public disorder. When other ministers (including Ward's son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74381/', "John Ashburne")</script> at the Tower Church) were ejected, there were riots on the streets and Wren's agents were driven from the town. On their next visit to Ipswich, Wren and his wife felt intimidated and left hurriedly. For ignoring these commotions, the bailiffs and portmen were summoned to the Star Chamber. Suggestions that Samuel Ward joined William Bridge in the Netherlands on his release can be firmly refuted, as the Ward concerned was John, ordained at Norwich in 1614 and rector of St Michael-at-Plea there from 1617 to his suspension in 1636.<br>
<br>Over his thirty-five years in Ipswich, Ward was executor to many of the leading townspeople, usually a beneficiary, and became increasingly wealthy. In 1631 he was offered and &#145;thankfully accepted&#146;  (Suffolk RO, Ipswich C/4/3/1/5, assembly book, 196) the interest on the town's &pound;100 stake in the Virginia plantation by a grateful corporation. In the following year he offered land worth &pound;1000 to one Jeffery Kirbye, who would have bequeathed it to the Grocers' Company had they chosen Ipswich rather than Oundle for their foundation. In April 1638 he bought his tied house from the borough for &pound;140. Following his death at his home in March 1640, he was buried on 8 March in the centre nave aisle at St Mary-le-Tower under a stone with the inscription &#145;Watch Ward and yet a little while and he that shall come will come&#146;  (monumental inscription). He was remembered in the anonymous tract <span class="italic">Wrens Anatomy, Discovering his Notorious Pranks and Shamefull Wickednesse</span> (1641) as that &#145;ancient famous, good and painfull Master Ward&#146;. His widow, Deborah, and eldest son, Samuel, continued to enjoy his stipend for their lives. Samuel, a Cambridge graduate, showed symptoms of schizophrenia, for in August 1661 he murdered his brother-in-law John Ashburne by stabbing. Two other sons were in orders. Nathaniel was rector of Stapleford, Cambridgeshire, and Joseph was rector of Badingham, where his mother spent her last days and was buried on 22 October 1652.<br>
