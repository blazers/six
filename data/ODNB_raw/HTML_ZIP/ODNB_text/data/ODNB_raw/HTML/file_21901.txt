<span class="headword">Pepwell <span class="st"> [Pepwall]</span>,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1539/40), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born in Birmingham. His father was probably the John Pepwell of Birmingham who was sued by a mercer in 1520 for a debt on a bond signed in St Sepulchre's parish, London  (TNA: PRO, CP 40/1029, rot. 323<i>v</i>). From 1518 his business was located at the sign of the Trinity in Paul's Cross Churchyard, London, formerly the house of the stationer Henry Jacobi, whose materials had passed to Pepwell. Jacobi's device, with the surname cut out, first appears on Pepwell's 1519 edition of Stanbridge's <span class="italic">Accidence</span>. Pepwell also employed an assistant, Roger Shedmore. Pepwell was warden of the Company of Stationers in 1525&#150;6.<br>
<br>Sixteen books survive that were printed by or for Pepwell between 1518 and 1539. Two are vernacular works of fiction: William Neville's <span class="italic">Castell of Pleasure</span>, with additions by Robert Copland, and the <span class="italic">Boke of the Cyte of Ladyes</span>, Brian Anslay's translation of the work by Christine de Pisan. There is a verse preface by the printer in the latter, describing the patronage of the third earl of Kent, Richard Grey. Pepwell was involved with printing of early English humanist texts, issuing a number of grammar books, including some by John Colet and William Lily for use at St Paul's School in London, and work by Erasmus. The remainder of the books that carry his imprint are legal or religious; they include an edition of Richard of St Victor with extracts from the writings of the English mystic Margery Kempe. Pepwell probably also printed indulgences and images of pity  (see <span class="italic">STC, 1475&#150;1640</span>, 14077c.11c).<br>
<br>In 1526 Pepwell was among those present when the bishop of London issued his second set of injunctions to the booksellers  (Reed, 173&#150;5). In 1531 he commissioned an edition of Eckius's <span class="italic">Adversus Lutheranos</span> from the Antwerp printer Michael Hillenius; John Bale states that Pepwell was employed by John Stokesley, bishop of London, to do so. In a letter of August 1533 from Stephen Vaughan to Thomas Cromwell about the recusant cardinal William Peto, Pepwell is identified for questioning about the business of Thomas Dockwray, a fellow stationer who was in Antwerp on behalf of Stokesley. In May 1538 Pepwell was one of six Londoners who each raised 500 marks bail for Stokesley following his arrest by Cromwell for the execution of a papal bull. In 1536 he was one of the syndicate of publishers involved with John Wayland in publishing Hilsey's primer.<br>
<br>Pepwell is often named in documents relating to the community of stationers at Paul's Cross in his parish of St Faith's. His business was valued at &pound;40 for the 1523&#150;4 lay subsidy for that parish, and he and Dockwray were appointed petty collectors of the king's subsidy in St Faith's in 1536. In 1538 he travelled to St Albans to accompany the monastery printer (probably John Herford) back to London, where the latter was questioned by the stationers William Bonham and Henry Tab on Cromwell's behalf. In September 1539 he was in arrears for his Paul's Cross property; the same document names Tab, Dockwray, Bonham, John Reynes, Thomas Petit, and Polydore Vergil as neighbours. Pepwell had been bequeathed &pound;4 of books by Wynkyn de Worde in 1534 and he and Bonham are named in a fragment of a 1537 or 1539 account book from de Worde's shop, where Pepwell is charged for copies of a (probably 1536) edition of <span class="italic">Adam Bell</span>, Stanbridge's <span class="italic">Accidence</span>, and a Latin primer.<br>
<br>Pepwell died between 11 September 1539, when he made his will, and 8 February 1540, when it was proved by his widow, Ursula, his sole executor. This may or may not be the daughter of Paul Alexander mentioned as Pepwell's wife in a complaint to chancery of 1531/2  (TNA: PRO, C 1/608/29, C 1/609/39). He left instructions to be buried in the Pardon churchyard near St Paul's, and bequeathed a mass book and 5<i>s</i>. to his old parish church in Birmingham for prayers for his soul; Bonham is named as a supervisor. He divided his property among his widow and his children, none of whom is named in the will. Arthur Pepwell, who is mentioned in the Stationers' Company register after 1554, is probably a descendant.<br>
