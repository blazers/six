<span class="headword">Paul, Sir  James Balfour</span>  (1846&#150;1931), <span class="occ">herald and genealogist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 16 November 1846, the younger of two sons of the Revd John Paul (1796&#150;1873), minister of St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, and moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1847&#150;8, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1860), daughter of James Balfour of Pilrig, writer to the signet. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and at the University of Edinburgh, and was called to the Scottish bar in 1870. He was editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Jurisprudence</span> and later served as treasurer of the Faculty of Advocates (1883&#150;1902). Married on 18 June 1872, he and his wife, Helen Margaret (<i>d</i>. 20 Dec 1929), daughter of John Wairne Forman of Staffa, had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Paul was appointed lord Lyon king of arms in March 1890 and held that office until 1926; he was also secretary of the Order of the Thistle in a period which saw the erection of the order's chapel at St Giles, Edinburgh. He was knighted in 1900 and appointed KCVO in the year of his retirement. He had the advantage of serving as Lyon at a time of renewed and well-informed enthusiasm for heraldry in Scotland. For many years the Lyon office had slumbered, and the court of the lord Lyon had exercised little more than a nominal jurisdiction. The little work that was expected of Lyon was performed, with greater or lesser skill, by an official called the Lyon-depute, who received a fraction of Lyon's sinecure. Reforms came, and Paul's immediate predecessor was George Burnett, a scholar and a gentleman, who had compiled the first good book on Scottish heraldry to be written for many years. Paul was determined to follow in this tradition.<br>
<br>Paul's chief and most lasting contribution to Scottish heraldry is his masterly edition of <span class="italic">The Scots Peerage</span> (1909&#150;14) in nine finely printed and beautifully illustrated volumes. It was fortunate that a work of this magnitude was completed on the eve of the First World War. It effectively replaced all former Scottish peerage reference works and, on the whole, was comprehensive and accurate in the information it contained. Unlike <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span> it was not limited to successors to titles of honour and their immediate heirs. Amateurs of quaint and curious footnotes are likely to be disappointed. <span class="italic">The Scots Peerage</span>, as Paul acknowledged, was not his work alone&#151;he received much assistance from a well-chosen body of able and learned persons&#151;but there can be no doubt that he inspired the work and deserves most of the credit for it.<br>
<br>In the Lyon office Paul was best-remembered for his first two editions of a useful and almost essential guide to the contents of the Lyon register, valuable at a time when the number of grants and matriculations was rapidly increasing. His other important contribution to Scottish heraldic literature was his <span class="italic">Heraldry in Relation to Scottish History and Art</span> (1900), the publication of his Rhind lectures on archaeology delivered to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. To some extent this work represented a new and possibly enlightened view of heraldry. It was certainly a departure from the days of crudely painted armorials and dubious family histories, and it helped to introduce heraldry to the reader as an art form in itself. Additionally, Paul often contributed to journals on history and antiquities, and he was responsible for much of the work involved in preparing the <span class="roman">Record</span> series volumes of <span class="italic">Registrum magni sigilli</span> and <span class="italic">Accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland</span>.<br>
<br>Paul was an enthusiastic and greatly appreciated member of the Royal Company of Archers (HM bodyguard for Scotland), which he joined in 1871; he published the history of the company in 1875. He took an active interest in the work of the Scottish History Society, the Scottish Record Society, and the Scottish Ecclesiological Society. In 1908 he was awarded an honorary LLD degree by his old university, in view of his public and scholarly achievements. He died on 15 September 1931.<br>
