<span class="headword">Findlay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Backhouse]</span>, Dame  Harriet Jane</span>, Lady Findlay  (1881&#150;1954), <span class="occ">political activist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 12 March 1881, the only daughter of Sir Jonathan Edmund Backhouse, first baronet (1849&#150;1918), and his wife, Florence (<i>d</i>. 1902), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56067/', "Sir John Salusbury Salusbury-Trelawny, ninth baronet")</script>. Her father, a banker, was a director of Barclay &amp; Co. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30513/', "Sir Edmund Trelawny Backhouse, second baronet")</script>, the Sinologist, was the eldest of her five brothers, two of whom became admirals [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30514/', "Backhouse, Sir Roger Roland Charles")</script>]. Nothing is known about her education or her early life before her marriage, on 9 July 1901, to Sir John Ritchie Findlay (1866&#150;1930), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9454/', "John Ritchie Findlay")</script> of Aberlour, Banffshire, proprietor of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> newspaper. Her husband, who succeeded as proprietor of the paper, also inherited his father's interest in Scottish culture, and advised on the national galleries, ancient monuments, fine arts, and education. On the outbreak of the First World War he became chairman of the Scottish National Housing Company, entrusted with the construction of housing at the naval base at Rosyth. During the 1920s he advised the Conservative government on house-building in Scotland. He was appointed KBE in 1917 and was created a baronet in 1925.<br>
<br>The couple had three sons and two daughters, but later Harriet Findlay devoted much of her time to political activities and charitable work, particularly for institutions promoting the health and welfare of women and children, which she was in a good position to support because of her wealth and social standing. It is not known whether she had earlier participated in the campaign for women's suffrage, but during the 1920s she was involved in politics through the work of the Scottish Unionist Association, the successor to the National Union of Conservative Associations for Scotland. She also played a role on the Scottish women's committee of the party, established in 1920 as a belated response to the enfranchisement of women two years earlier. She became a JP in Edinburgh in 1926. In 1927 she was elected president of the Scottish Unionist Association, the first woman to hold the office. She was appointed DBE for political and public service in 1929. In the following year she was widowed; her eldest son, Sir John Edmund Ritchie Findlay (1902&#150;1962), who succeeded to the baronetcy and the proprietorship of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, was Unionist MP for Banffshire, 1939&#150;45.<br>
<br>Lady Findlay chaired the management board of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and her energy, ability, and tact helped steer the institution through the financial difficulties created by the depression. She was also a manager of the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital, a member of the council of the Queen's Institute for District Nursing, and president of the Banffshire Nursing Association. Perhaps influenced by the seagoing tradition of her husband's home county and her brothers' naval careers, she did much voluntary work for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. In 1932 she was appointed an honorary life governor and received a vellum signed by the president, the prince of Wales, the highest honour the institution could give. Her drive and enthusiasm were such that lifeboat days in Edinburgh saw a succession of imposing financial returns.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War Lady Findlay volunteered for the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps, which assisted the police and civil defence in emergencies. She worked in the canteen section and became a sergeant. For many years she played a prominent role in the Victoria League, which established canteens and hostels for members of the forces. She was chair of the committee of management of the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital, an Edinburgh institution for the care and rehabilitation of disabled children, and welcomed Princess Margaret on her first visit there in 1946. She was further involved in Highland Home Industries, a promotional and marketing organization for handicraft and other goods manufactured in the Scottish highlands. On several occasions she accompanied members of the royal family on visits to the organization's depot in Edinburgh. She was also a trustee of the National Library of Scotland.<br>
<br>Lady Findlay died at her home, 13 Moray Place, Edinburgh, on 24 July 1954. According to a tribute which appeared in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, she had devoted much of her life to charitable and social work, to which she brought &#145;a gracious personality, an unflagging enthusiasm, a conscientious devotion to duty, as well as intellectual ability&#146;. A memorial service in St Giles's Cathedral celebrated her public service. This kind of commitment was typical of many women of her generation and class, but why in the longer term she eschewed politics is unknown.<br>
