<span class="headword">Day,  Lewis Foreman</span>  (1845&#150;1910), <span class="occ">decorative artist and industrial designer</span>, was born at Peckham Rye, Surrey, on 29 January 1845, the son of Samuel Hulme Day, wine merchant in the City of London, of an old Quaker family of Essex, which claimed descent from John Day (1521/2&#150;1584), the Elizabethan printer. His mother was Mary Ann Lewis. After attending a school in France, he entered Merchant Taylors' School in January 1858, and on leaving continued his education in Germany for eighteen months. After a short time as a clerk he went, at the age of twenty, into the works of Lavers and Barraud, glass painters and designers. Day then moved to the workshops of Clayton and Bell, makers of stained glass, where he remained for two years; his principal work being to design the cartoons. In 1870 he worked for Heaton, Butler and Bayne on the decoration of Eaton Hall, Cheshire, and in the same year he started his own business in London. In 1873 he married Ruth Emma Morrish with whom he had a daughter, Ruth.<br>
<br>Day took from his early training a special interest in stained glass design, gradually acquiring a wider reputation as a designer for textiles, pottery, carpets, wallpapers, silver, and many other branches of manufacture. His designs were always carefully adapted to the material in which they were to be carried out, and to the processes of manufacture which had to be employed. He belonged to the same school of artist&#150;craftsmen as William Morris and Walter Crane, and his influence on contemporary ornament, if not so fully recognized as that of those two artists, was considerable. An important educator in design, many of the best-known designers of his day were taught by him and benefited from his belief in natural forms of ornament and high standards of craftsmanship.<br>
<br>Day was one of the first promoters of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society and a founder in 1882 of the Fifteen, a group of artists interested in the role of design in daily life, and of the Art-Workers' Guild, of which he was at one time master. He was also seen as a &#145;forerunner, of a still transitional character&#146;  (N. Pevsner, <span class="italic">Pioneers of Modern Design</span>, 1936, repr. 1991, 26), of the modern movement: Pevsner noted Day's remark that &#145;&#147;whether we like it or no, machinery and steam power and electricity for all we know, will have something to say concerning the ornament of the future&#148;&#146;  (ibid.). A course of Cantor lectures at the Royal Society of Arts in 1886, &#145;Ornamental design&#146;, was followed by the publication of many important volumes on ornament and decoration, including <span class="italic">Anatomy of Pattern</span> (1887), and <span class="italic">The Planning of Ornament</span> (1887).<br>
<br>From 1897 to his death Day was almost continuously a member of the council of the Royal Society of Arts. His services to the government department, originally that of science and art, and afterwards the Board of Education were much appreciated. From 1890 onwards he examined in painting and ornament, and later with William Morris, Walter Crane, and other decorative artists examined works sent in by schools of art for national competitions. Shortly before 1900 he gave courses of lectures on ornamental art at the Royal College of Art, South Kensington, and he also inspected and reported on provincial schools of art where ornamental work was studied and practised. When the Victoria and Albert Museum was established in its new building (1909) he was a member of the committee appointed to report upon the arrangement of the collections, and he greatly influenced the scheme which was eventually adopted.<br>
<br>Of his published works Day was most satisfied with <span class="italic">Windows</span> (1897; 3rd edn 1909), the fruit of an exhaustive study of continental stained glass pursued in holiday tours over twenty years. He contributed many articles to the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>, the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">Journal of Decorative Art</span>. His monograph on his friend William Morris was published in an extra number of the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1899. He was also author of <span class="italic">Instances of Accessory Ornament</span> (1880); <span class="italic">Every Day Art</span> (1882; 2nd edn 1894; Dutch trans. 1886); <span class="italic">Alphabets Old and New</span> (1898; 3rd enlarged edn 1910); (with Mary Buckle) <span class="italic">Art in Needlework</span> (1900; 3rd edn 1908); <span class="italic">Lettering in Ornament</span> (1902); <span class="italic">Pattern Design</span> (1903); the South Kensington handbook <span class="italic">Stained Glass</span> (1903); <span class="italic">Ornament and its Application</span> (1904); <span class="italic">Enamelling</span> (1907); and <span class="italic">Nature and Ornament</span> (2 vols., 1908&#150;9). He died at his house, 15 Taviton Street, Gordon Square, on 18 April 1910, and is buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
