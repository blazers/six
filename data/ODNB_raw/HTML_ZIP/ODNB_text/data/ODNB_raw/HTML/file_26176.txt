<span class="headword">Sprenger,  Aloys Ignatz Christoph</span>  (1813&#150;1893), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born on 3 September 1813 at 3/4 Nassereith, Tyrol, Austria, the ninth of ten children of Christoph Sprenger (1760&#150;1835), collector of customs and storekeeper, and his wife, Theresia (1772&#150;1850), daughter of Johann Dietrich, butcher, and his wife, Johanna. He attended grammar school in Innsbruck (1827&#150;32) and university in Vienna (1832&#150;6). Notwithstanding the support of the famous Austrian orientalist Hammer-Purgstall, he could not find an adequate post. Disappointed, he left Vienna in 1836 and went to London where he approached G. A. Fitzclarence, the earl of Munster. Sprenger became his secretary and contributor to his projected work, &#145;Military science among the Mussulmans&#146;. In 1838 he obtained British citizenship, which was very useful for his future career. In June 1840 he graduated as doctor of medicine at Leiden with the dissertation &#145;De originibus medicinae arabicae sub khalifatu&#146;.<br>
<br>After the death of the earl of Munster, Sprenger gained a post in the medical service of the East India Company. On 16 April 1842 he married Catharina M&uuml;ller (1810&#150;1893), daughter of John Peter M&uuml;ller of Frankfurt, and in 1843 they went to India. They had three sons, of whom the eldest, Aloys, joined the public works department in India. Sprenger soon started a successful career in the educational system, focusing on the modernization of language training and the development of the native languages. From 1845 to 1847 he was principal of Delhi College. He published the first weekly magazine in Hindustani as well as an <span class="italic">English&#150;Hindustany Grammar</span> (1845). Besides this he began to edit works of oriental authors, including al-Kasani's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Technical Terms of the Sufies</span> (1845) and &#145;Utbi's <span class="italic">History of Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznah</span> (1847). From March 1848 to January 1850 he was in Lucknow, where he examined approximately 10,000 oriental manuscripts. Since nearly all these works were destroyed in 1857, Sprenger's <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Arabic, Persian and Hind&uacute;st&aacute;ny manuscripts of the libraries of the king of Oudh</span> (1854) is a unique document of early Hindustani poetry. It is considered to be one of the essential works of the literary history of the Hindustani language and was later also translated into Urdu.<br>
<br>From 1850 to 1854 Sprenger was the head of the Madrasas in Calcutta and Hooghly and translator to the government of India. As a secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1851&#150;4) he had influence on the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Indica</span>, a series in which he edited the principal works of Persian and Arabic authors, including Nizami's <span class="italic">Iskandarnama</span> (vol. 12, 1852), at-Tusi's <span class="italic">List of Shy'ah Books</span> (vol. 19, 1853&#150;5), and others. Besides this he published twenty-three articles in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>, concentrating especially on early Islamic history. In 1854 his wife and sons went to Europe while he travelled for almost two years through the Middle East. In 1856 he returned to India, but when he repudiated a financial agreement with F. Boutras, a former principal of Delhi College, he was removed from all his civil posts and went back to Europe. However, the thirteen years Sprenger spent in oriental countries were not only the happiest in his life, but also of greatest influence on his further scientific works.<br>
<br>From 1856 to 1858 Sprenger lived near Heidelberg, where he completed his <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Bibliotheca Orientalis Sprengeriana</span> (1857), a collection of nearly 2000 manuscripts and rare lithographs, which he sold to the king of Prussia in 1858. By the late twentieth century the largest part of the collection was in the Preussischer Kulturbesitz, the state library, in Berlin. In 1858 Sprenger was asked to be professor of oriental languages at the University of Bern. During his time in Switzerland (1858&#150;81) he published some of his most valuable works, mainly on ancient geography and early Islamic history. Besides several articles in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft</span>, he issued <span class="italic">Die alte Geographie Arabiens</span> (1875), a work which set new standards for research on pre-Islamic Arabia.<br>
<br>The focus of Sprenger's interest was the biography of Muhammad. His exhaustive study <span class="italic">Das Leben und die Lehre des Mohammad</span> (3 vols., 1861&#150;5) is mainly based on the analysis of Arabic sources which were unknown until then. Sprenger's aim was to show that the emergence of Islam was more a product of the <i>zeitgeist</i> than the act of the prophet Muhammad. The importance of this and other works lies primarily in the fact that Sprenger looked at his subject from a global perspective. This, and his insight into oriental society and its way of thinking, distinguished him from many of his contemporaries. Sprenger's theories on the emergence of Islam became, though extremely controversial, of great importance for the further development of Islamic studies. In 1881 Sprenger was divorced and returned to Heidelberg where he married Antonia (1818&#150;1911), daughter of Dr Johann Diehl, physician, and Sofia Diehl, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fleischmann. Sprenger died of influenza on 19 December 1893 at his home, Leopoldstrasse 43, Heidelberg. His ashes were buried on 22 December at the urn cemetery there.<br>
