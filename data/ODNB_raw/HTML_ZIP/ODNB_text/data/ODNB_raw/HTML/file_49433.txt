<span class="headword">Betts,  Edward Ladd</span>  (1815&#150;1872), <span class="occ">railway contractor</span>, was born on 5 June 1815 at Buckland, near Dover, the eldest son of William Betts (<i>d</i>. 1867), contractor's agent, of Sandown, Kent, and his first wife, Elizabeth Hayward, daughter of Edward Ladd of Buckland. Betts was apprenticed to Richardson, a builder, at Lincoln, but showed a bent for engineering, for which the emerging &#145;railway age&#146; was to offer vast scope.<br>
<br>Under the superintendence of his father, as agent for the great contractor Hugh McIntosh, Betts worked on building the Black Rock lighthouse at Beaumaris, north Wales. Then, when he was only eighteen, he superintended building for McIntosh the Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway (Liverpool&#150;Birmingham) under the engineer George Stephenson, a &pound;54,000 undertaking that introduced him to the world of railway construction in which thereafter he was continuously engaged. At first he was working in conjunction with his father and brother as agent for McIntosh, after whose death in 1840 William Betts &amp; Sons operated for about four years, securing contracts on the South Eastern Railway (including the Saltwood Tunnel, 1843), which Betts took over on his own account in 1845. At that time he also won a number of contracts in the Chester area. His work on the South Eastern Railway (his tender for the Tunbridge Wells&#150;Robertsbridge section alone amounting to &pound;270,000 in 1847) adjoined that of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22042/', "Samuel Morton Peto")</script>. On 6 July 1843 he married Peto's sister Ann (<i>b</i>. 1821), with whom he had six sons and three daughters. After the dissolution of Peto's partnership with Thomas Grissell in 1846, Betts joined Peto in constructing the Great Northern Railway loop line from Peterborough through Boston and Lincoln to Doncaster, as well as its associated East Lincolnshire line from Boston to Louth. A formal partnership was established in 1848, with which his affairs were thereafter inextricably entwined.<br>
<br>During the early 1850s, a period of railway company consolidation in England, Peto and Betts turned their efforts overseas, undertaking the Danish railway system from 1852. That same year they began working on the formidable enterprise of the Grand Trunk railroad of Canada, linking Quebec with Montreal, Toronto, and Detroit, in which they were stockholders; their contract provided for their being paid in a mixture of cash, shares, and bonds. Betts undertook the actual management of this 539 mile loss-making venture (rescued from collapse by the Canadian government), in which a primary element was the construction of the huge Victoria Bridge across the St Lawrence River. To manufacture the requisite metal parts and rolling-stock, the partners set up the Canada Works in Birkenhead, which subsequently supplied their other worldwide contracts, such as the Buenos Aires&#150;Rosario line, and those from D&uuml;naberg to Vitebsk in Russia (220 miles), and from Algiers to Blida. In Australia their pioneering efforts were performed in collaboration with Thomas Brassey. In the USA Betts was involved in the New York to Chicago and St Louis line.<br>
<br>In the Crimean War, Betts undertook the organization of a railway from the British base at Balaklava to the front, which Peto had offered to construct, dispatching twenty-three large steamers with engineers, workmen, horses, and stores. Here, as in the partners' other undertakings, Betts's role &#145;lay in the execution of contracts&#151;no one had a greater practical knowledge &hellip; his eagle eye would fasten on a rivet missing&#146;  (Peto, 51).<br>
<br>At home the partners' close involvement in East Anglian lines led them to undertake the London, Tilbury, and Southend, opened in 1854&#150;6, which they leased as operators for twenty-one years from 1854, a speculation said in 1863 to be losing &pound;24,000 a year. The <span class="italic">Railway Times</span> reported (27 September 1856) that Betts &#145;wielded for a brief season the destinies of the Eastern Counties [railway]&#146;, in which he, like Peto and Brassey, had become a shareholder. As chairman in 1851&#150;2 Betts suppressed an engine drivers' strike, but an accident affecting his eyesight forced him to resign. He was also contractor for the Strood and Maidstone line in Kent. This ran close to his &#145;palatial residence&#146; near Aylesford, Preston Hall, rebuilt in 1850 by John Thomas (Peto's architect) in a dreary Jacobean style, where in 1861 he employed five gardeners, a groom and coachman, and an indoor staff of eight women and three men servants. In 1858 Betts, already a magistrate and deputy lieutenant, became high sheriff of Kent. In the 1865 general election he unsuccessfully contested Maidstone as a Conservative. At his London home, 29 Tavistock Square, in 1851, describing himself as &#145;engineer&#146;, he employed two men servants, five women, and a page; by 1860 he had moved on to Great George Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Peto and Betts involved themselves in expensive undertakings in the south-east, where rival lines fought to secure the traffic between London and the ports. It was their involvement in the affairs of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company, for which they were building a metropolitan extension from London Bridge to Victoria (in partnership with Thomas Russell Crampton), that brought disaster. Paid entirely in the company's shares and debentures, entangled in dubious finance-raising schemes, and with their overseas operations hindered by the Danish and Austrian wars, Peto and Betts were forced to stop payment in the banking crisis of 1866. Their partnerships were made insolvent the following year. Their only subsequent contract was for minor alterations on the Metropolitan Railway, to which Betts gave close attention. In 1869 he travelled to Budapest in connection with abortive proposals for improving the navigation of the Danube.<br>
<br>An obituary speaks of Betts's &#145;untiring application &hellip; and indomitable energy &hellip; clear judgment &hellip; and vigorous mind that grasped at once the main points of a question, and quickly decided on its merits&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 35, 1872, 285&#150;8). A stern rectitude in his dealings was said to be allied to a general benevolence and a warmth of friendship. After his bankruptcy, which necessitated his selling Preston Hall, Betts moved to Bickley, near Bromley, Kent, where he could still maintain a carriage. In 1871 his doctors sent him to winter in Egypt, where he died at Aswan on 21 January 1872, survived by his wife. He was buried at Aylesford.<br>
