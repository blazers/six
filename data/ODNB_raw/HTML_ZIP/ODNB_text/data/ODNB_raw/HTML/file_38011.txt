<span class="headword">Stockmar,  Christian Friedrich</span>, Baron Stockmar  (1787&#150;1863), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 22 August 1787 in Coburg, of German parentage and Swedish descent, the eldest son and second child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Johann Ernest Gotthelf Stockmar, a scientific lawyer. A quiet, unobtrusive youth, Stockmar was educated at Coburg Gymnasium and from 1805 to 1810 studied medicine at the universities of W&uuml;rzburg, Erlangen, and Jena.<br>
<br>In 1812 Stockmar opened a military hospital in Coburg. He was favourably noticed by Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and in 1816 was invited to be Leopold's physician-in-ordinary. Leopold made Stockmar promise never to leave him after his wife, Princess Charlotte, died in childbirth in 1817 at Claremont House near Windsor. Prudently, &#145;Stocky&#146; had not attended her, just held her hand. He was promoted to be Leopold's private secretary and in 1831, when his master became king of the Belgians, a Bavarian baron. He helped organize Leopold's court, devised the constitution, and inspired the Coburg&#150;Portuguese marriage of 1835; above all he promoted the marriage between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Leopold's nephew, in 1840. Stockmar's royal career was well under way.<br>
<br>On 20 June 1837 Victoria had ascended the British throne. Sixteen days earlier &#145;the Baron&#146; (as Victoria and Albert called him) had been sent to England by her &#145;Uncle Leopold&#146; as his <i>alter ego</i>, and was Victoria's guest at breakfast on her first day as queen. He was soon working on a valuable theory of the crown as above party politics. He left England in 1838 to assess the suitability of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha for Victoria's consort, returning when they married. For the next seventeen years he spent only the summers in Germany, saying of Albert, &#145;I love him as if he were my own son.&#146; With Albert he planned the royal children's education (which had, in the case of the prince of Wales, such disastrous results) and systematized the royal household. He took care not to get involved in court favours, such as the bribe offered by an MP of &pound;10,000 to obtain him a peerage.<br>
<br>Stockmar's political views were sometimes absurd. &#145;The omnipotence of the House of Commons&#146;, he wrote, &#145;is revolution itself and death to the true old English constitution&#146;&#151;of which he fancied himself the best judge. He distrusted British statesmen: Sir Robert Peel was &#145;myopic&#146;, Lord Palmerston &#145;insane&#146;. He advised the monarch to avoid being &#145;a Mandarin figure&#146; but to become a &#145;Permanent Premier&#146;. The European revolutions of 1848 he saw as a golden opportunity for introducing constitutional monarchies and for a united Germany in alliance with Britain. His position was not an easy one: in England he was suspected of being an intriguer, while some in Germany saw him as an English spy.<br>
<br>By 1855 Stockmar's health was failing. In the past he had settled several disputes between Victoria and Albert. Now his &#145;nerves&#146; were too weak to make his advice effective. He returned to Germany for good in 1857, moving for a time to Berlin to be near the princess royal and her husband, Prince Frederick William of Prussia. When Prince Albert died in 1861, Stockmar's hopes were shattered and his influence diminished. It was not until his last years that he enjoyed a real home life, though married in 1821 in Coburg to a cousin, Fanny Sommer (<i>d</i>. in or after 1863), the daughter of a physician; they had two sons and one daughter. He died on 9 July 1863 in Coburg. His son Ernest wrote Stockmar's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, describing them as lifting the veil &#145;but a little&#146;. An angry Queen Victoria, however, felt it had been lifted far too much, particularly over the clashes between Palmerston, as foreign secretary, and the prince consort.<br>
