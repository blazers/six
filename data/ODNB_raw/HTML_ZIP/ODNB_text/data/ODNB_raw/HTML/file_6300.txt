<span class="headword">Connacht,  saints of</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>400&#150;<em>c.</em>800), <span class="occ">holy men and women believed to have been buried within the province of Connacht</span>, flourished in the period of the fifth century to the eighth. The province ruled by the Connachta, a group of dynasties claiming to be distantly related, had few outstanding saints. The only one of the front rank was <a href="#cosubject_3321">Brendan of Clonfert [<i>see below</i>]</a>; and even he came from the Altraige of west Kerry, where his other principal church, Ardfert, ministered to his own people. The importance of Connacht for hagiography lies elsewhere than among the major saints, such as those who came to be designated in the genealogies of the saints and other sources as &#145;the twelve apostles of Ireland&#146;. Because of the account of St Patrick's circuit round Ireland written by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27473/', "Bishop T&#237;rech&#225;n")</script> <i>c</i>.690, there is a large amount of information on the minor saints of Connacht who were believed to be of early date. Among them are several whose cults appear to have collapsed for political reasons. Elsewhere it is usually the successful cults that yield evidence; the particular interest of Connacht is, therefore, its failed saints. Another feature of significance, however, is its group of late arrivals. Most major Irish saints belonged to the sixth century; in Connacht, however, two considerable saints, Comm&aacute;n of Roscommon and Garald (Gerald) of Mayo<a href="#cosubject_10546"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, belonged to the eighth.<h2>
<a name="Earlysaints"></a>Early saints</h2>Connacht contains the only Irish site, &#145;the Wood of Voclut&#146;, later Caill Fochlad in north co. Mayo, securely associated with St Patrick in his own writings. An early church, Domnach M&oacute;r, was adjacent to Caill Fochlad; moreover Bishop T&iacute;rech&aacute;n was a native of the kingdom to which Caill Fochlad and Domnach M&oacute;r belonged, and a member of its dynasty, U&iacute; Amolngada. Domnach M&oacute;r, however, was later supplanted by Killala (Cell Alaid) as the chief church of the U&iacute; Amolngada; hence the eclipse of the cult of the saint whose bones were said by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n to lie at Domnach M&oacute;r, <a name="cosubject_64410"></a><span class="headword">Mucnoe <span class="st"> [Mucneus]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>500). His feast day was not recorded in any of the Irish martyrologies, whereas <a name="cosubject_64411"></a><span class="headword">Muiredach mac Echdach</span>  (<em>fl. </em>early 6th cent.) of Killala had his feast day, 12 August. The latest of the major martyrologies, that of Donegal, says that Muiredach belonged to an U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasty, Cen&eacute;l L&oacute;egairi, whose main lands lay around Trim, far to the east of Connacht's eastern boundary, the Shannon. T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, however, in the late seventh century, placed Muiredach a little to the east of the U&iacute; Amolngada, in the coastal strip along the southern coast of Sligo Bay and thus within the kingdom of U&iacute; Fhiachrach Muaide. This raises the possibility that the replacement of Domnach M&oacute;r by Killala as the chief church of the U&iacute; Amolngada to the west of the Moy may have owed much to the influence of the U&iacute; Fhiachrach Muaide, since they were the most powerful dynasty of northern Connacht. Muiredach may also have been thought by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n to be the eponymous saint of Inishmurray, Inis Muiredaig in Sligo Bay, although the patron saint of the island monastery was <a name="cosubject_64412"></a><span class="headword">Laisr&eacute;n <span class="st"> [Mo Laisse]</span> mac Decl&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.), whose feast day was 12 August and who was affiliated in the genealogies of the saints to the Westmeath people, Corcu Ro&iacute;de. Laisr&eacute;n also had a mainland base at Aughris (Echross), close to where T&iacute;rech&aacute;n placed Muiredach.<br>
<br>Mucnoe was said by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n to have been the brother of a more important saint, <a name="cosubject_64414"></a><span class="headword">C&eacute;thech <span class="st"> [Caetiacus, Cethiachus]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, whose feast day was 16 June. C&eacute;thech's name suggests that he may, in reality, have been a Briton (it is probably a nickname, Welsh <i>coediog</i>, &#145;woody&#146;) but for T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, <i>c</i>.690, C&eacute;thech belonged to the U&iacute; Ailella, an important but declining royal dynasty of north-eastern Connacht. T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's evidence suggests that the U&iacute; Ailella had been powerful within Mag nA&iacute;, the most fertile area of all Connacht, between Elphin and Roscommon. C&eacute;thech's main church was at Cell Garad, on the southern edge of Mag nA&iacute; (earlier Br&iacute; Garad, now Oran from the name of the holy well, Uar&aacute;n Garad, marked by the remains of a round tower and a church). From T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's time onwards, the U&iacute; Ailella were confined to the area between Elphin and Collooney in co. Sligo. Their loss of power in Mag nA&iacute; may be the explanation of an anecdote in the <span class="roman">Book of Armagh</span>, which tells a story of disobedience. C&eacute;thech and another early saint, Sachellus, were said to have ordained bishops and consecrated churches without Patrick's permission. Patrick summoned them to Armagh; and, although they did penance, he declared that &#145;Your churches will not be great&#146;  (Bieler, 122&#150;3).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64416"></a><span class="headword">Sachellus</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.), like C&eacute;thech, was a <span class="occ">bishop</span>; as C&eacute;thech was identified with his supposed father's people, the U&iacute; Ailella, and, in a subordinate way, with his mother's people, the Sa&iacute;rige, a minor group close to Duleek, far to the east, so Sachellus and his church, Baislec, were identified with the Ciarraige nA&iacute;, a major client-kingdom within Mag nA&iacute;. Sachellus, very possibly another early British missionary, was listed by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n among Patrick's bishops. Baislec&#151;in Ireland a rare name for a church, borrowed from Latin <i>basilica</i>&#151;had been, earlier in the seventh century, the recipient of a special gift from Armagh, a share of its relics of Peter, Paul, and Laurence. The implication appears to be that Armagh then had high hopes of an alliance with Baislec, and thus with its saint, Sachellus. Late in the seventh century, however, these hopes were dashed, probably by the reduction of the Ciarraige nA&iacute; to close dependence on the rising dynasty of U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute;.<br>
<br>Early Connacht saints' cults were, then, liable to be eclipsed for political reasons. Only C&eacute;thech among those already mentioned found a place in the martyrologies, and only his church, Cell Garad, retained any importance in the post-viking period, as shown by the remains of its round tower. Yet his principal advantage seems to have lain in his possession of the famous well Uar&aacute;n Garad. Two early saints' cults, however, from north-eastern Connacht survived better. <a name="cosubject_64417"></a><span class="headword">Br&oacute;n mac Icni</span>  (<em>d.</em> 512), the saint of Caisel Irrae near the town of Sligo, was claimed by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n as another of Patrick's bishops. His feast day of 8 June is in the martyrologies; he is also mentioned in the Middle Irish genealogical collections among a list of bishops, but no pedigree is given. Already in T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's day, Br&oacute;n's church claimed to possess a tooth of St Patrick&#151;a rare early example of an Irish corporeal relic. It was later enshrined, received a hereditary guardian, and survived long enough to be one of the most valued relics of the entire province of Connacht as late as the seventeenth century; it is preserved in the National Museum. Br&oacute;n's church and cult thus remained firmly entrenched in a limited area, the peninsula west of the town of Sligo, defended by his Patrician relic.<br>
<br>The cult of <a name="cosubject_64418"></a><span class="headword">B&eacute;o&aacute;ed mac Ocl&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 520/24), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, is broadly similar to that of Br&oacute;n, but without the Patrician connections of the latter. His feast day is 7 or 8 March. His church of Ard Carna lay within Mag Luirg, an area to the south of Lough Key and north of Elphin. The site, some 4 miles east of the town of Boyle, is marked by the modern Church of Ireland parish church. According to the saints' genealogies, where his father's name is given as Olc&aacute;n, B&eacute;o&aacute;ed belonged to the Corco Lo&iacute;gde of west Cork. His church and cult were of major but not dominant importance within the kingdom of Mag Luirg, ruled by a branch of the U&iacute; Ailella, &#145;the Sons of Erc&#146;. But, whereas the main line of the U&iacute; Ailella were on good terms with the heirs of Patrick, the Sons of Erc were not. Not only did their early bishop, B&eacute;o&aacute;ed, have no Patrician allegiance, but they later received an important Columban church at Assylin. <a name="cosubject_6300"></a><span class="headword">Cormac <span class="st"> [Corbmac]</span> mac Eogain</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.) was given a saint's life by John Colgan in his <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum &hellip; Hiberniae</span> (1645) on the basis of a genealogical tract in the late-medieval <span class="roman">Book of Lecan</span> (Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, MS 23 P 2). The tract is on a saintly family said to be descended from a collateral branch of the &Eacute;oganachta, the ruling dynasties of Munster. The most distinguished member of the family was not, however, Cormac, but his supposed brother, B&eacute;cc&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 690) of Cluain Ard Mo B&eacute;cc&oacute;c, Toureen Peacaun (co. Tipperary). Colgan's life takes Cormac to Connacht and settles him at the mouth of the River Moy (co. Mayo), but the chronological details are quite inconsistent with the annalistic obit for B&eacute;cc&aacute;n. The date of Cormac's death is unknown, his feast day uncertain.<h2>
<a name="ThemajorsaintsoftheConnachta"></a>The major saints of the Connachta</h2>B&eacute;o&aacute;ed appears to have been among the last of the early (that is, late fifth- and early sixth-century) saints who founded early episcopal churches within local kingdoms (<i>tuatha</i>). Most major saints belonged to the next two generations. The outstanding saint of Connacht was <a name="cosubject_3321"></a><span class="headword">Brendan of Clonfert</span> <span class="st"> [Br&eacute;nainn mac Findloga, Brendan the Navigator]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 577), whose feast day is 16 May and who is associated with Clonfert in Galway and Ardfert in Kerry. The previous saints have all been mentioned, at best, in the martyrologies, except that B&eacute;o&aacute;ed's generosity was celebrated in a Middle Irish poem; Brendan, however, was celebrated in a series of lives as well as in the <span class="italic">Navigatio sancti Brendani</span>. The relationship and dates of the texts have been disputed, but they indubitably bear witness to an enduring and widespread cult. Although Clonfert was the resting-place of his body, the cult far transcended the kingdom of the U&iacute; Maini, within which Clonfert lay. Indeed, the fourteenth-century text &#145;The customs of U&iacute; Maini&#146; shows that other, more local saints, such as <a name="cosubject_11482"></a><span class="headword">Grell&aacute;n of Cr&aacute;eb Grell&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;6th cent.), whose feast day is 10 November and whose crozier was carried into battle before the army of the U&iacute; Maini, were then as, or even more, important locally, as also was the cult of St Brigit, already entrenched in the area by the mid-seventh century.<br>
<br>Brendan belonged to the Altraige, a minor client people of the area north-west of Tralee. The <span class="italic">Navigatio</span>, probably written in the eighth century, claimed Brendan for the &Eacute;oganacht, apparently intending the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in, centred around Killarney, the overkings of west Munster. Later, however, as the power of the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in declined, Brendan was claimed by the increasingly powerful neighbours of the Altraige, Ciarraige Luachra (who gave their name to Kerry). The point of change is marked by a propaganda document known as the <span class="roman">West Munster Synod</span> (or <span class="roman">Macc Ardae's Synod</span>), probably written in the late eighth or early ninth century. It was designed to rally ecclesiastical support for a move to curtail yet further the powers of the king of the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in. In this text, Brendan is still &#145;moccu Altai&#146; (that is, a member of the Altraige), as he had been about a century earlier in Adomn&aacute;n's <span class="italic">Vita Columbae</span>, but he was said to swear an oath on behalf of the Ciarraige Luachra. His southern church, Ardfert, was now within the power of the Ciarraige Luachra and he had become a Ciarraige saint. The true local affiliation of Brendan was thus partially obscured, since his cult and church were of sufficient importance as to attract the rapacity of the leading kings of west Munster. The various Latin lives seem to derive from an original which ascribed Brendan to the Ciarraige Luachra. Yet his connection with the Altraige is still recorded in the Middle Irish life. Moreover the Connacht connections of the Altraige were to be repeated a century later in the person of <a name="cosubject_18865"></a><span class="headword">Mo Chua <span class="st"> [Cr&oacute;n&aacute;n]</span> mac B&eacute;c&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 694), the patron saint of Balla in modern co. Mayo, the most important church of the kingdom of Cerae. His cult, celebrated with a feast day on 30 March, was reinforced by a Middle Irish life, and the enduring significance of his church is attested by the remains of a round tower.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Navigatio</span> combined together Clonfert, Brendan's principal Connacht church, and Ardfert. He appears to have set out on his journey from Clonfert but to have completed it by coming to the land of his fathers, namely Ardfert and Altraige. Indeed, the text has Brendan die shortly after his return and fails to mention that he had left Ardfert, thus insinuating that he died at his southern church and not at Clonfert. Another indication of the Munster provenance of the <span class="italic">Navigatio</span> and its &Eacute;oganacht links is an episode in which Brendan and his companions visited an island called &#145;the island of Ailbe's community&#146;. Since <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47462/', "Ailbe")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51008/', "Munster, saints of")</script>] was the principal patron saint of Emly, the leading &Eacute;oganacht monastery, the inclusion of the incident flattered the honour of the &Eacute;oganachta as a whole, and not just the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in.<br>
<br>The importance of the links with the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in did not, however, exclude Clonfert. Not only did the <span class="italic">Navigatio</span> begin Brendan's journey at Clonfert, but the latter's connection with Munster endured after the saint's death. <a name="cosubject_50100"></a><span class="headword">Cumm&eacute;ne Fota</span> <span class="st"> [Cumain mac Fiachnai, Cummian]</span>  (<em>c.</em>591&#150;662), whose feast day is 12 November, was the most distinguished of Brendan's successors. Whereas his designated successor, <a name="cosubject_18889"></a><span class="headword">M&oacute;enu <span class="st"> [Mo&iacute;nenn]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 572), <span class="occ">bishop of Clonfert</span>, whose feast day is 1 March and who predeceased Brendan, was probably a Briton, Cumm&eacute;ne Fota is said to have belonged to the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in. This gives some colour to the notion that Ardfert was already controlled by the &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in in the mid-seventh century; Cumm&eacute;ne Fota's abbacy may thus reflect an enduring bond between Brendan's two principal foundations, giving the opportunity for a member of a west Munster dynasty, &Eacute;oganacht Locha L&eacute;in, to become abbot of Clonfert and successor of Brendan. Cumm&eacute;ne is likely to have been the author of the penitential of Cummian which had a wide influence, not only in Ireland, but also in England and Francia. His life is late, but there are several early stories in which Cumm&eacute;ne Fota plays a role, notably the ninth-century love story of two poets, Liadain and Cuirithir.<br>
<br>Whereas Brendan's <span class="italic">Navigatio</span> is likely to have been of Munster provenance, having probably been written at Ardfert itself, his lives are more concerned with Connacht. Not only is it made quite clear that Brendan's &#145;place of resurrection&#146; was Clonfert, but the saint is said to have had angelic guidance on his rule in Mag nA&iacute;, by the eighth and ninth centuries the principal kingdom of the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in, the ruling dynasty of the Connachta. While the saint's early years were moulded by his association with his foster father, Bishop Erc, whose presumed diocese may well have been the kingdom of Ciarraige Luachra, one of the principal characters of his Connacht career was <a name="cosubject_14665"></a><span class="headword">Iarlaithe <span class="st"> [Jarlath]</span> mac Loga</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.), patron saint of Tuam (Tuaimm d&aacute; Gualann), whose feast day is 25 or 26 December. This concern would fit a twelfth-century date, when, for example, the abbot of Clonfert and the archbishop of Tuam were among the three envoys of Ruaidhr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht, who concluded the treaty of Windsor in 1175 with Henry II. Yet if the original life lying behind the extant versions were as late as the twelfth century, it might have been expected that less attention would be given to Brendan's Munster background, since the rulers of Munster and Connacht were then inveterate enemies. Moreover, the life preserves the memory of Brendan's foundation on the island of Tiree, under Norse control since <i>c</i>.800.<h2>
<a name="Eighthcenturysaints"></a>Eighth-century saints</h2>Cumm&eacute;ne Fota died shortly before the great plague of 664&#150;5. One of the particular interests of Connacht for hagiography is the unusual importance of two eighth-century saints. The first was <a name="cosubject_6029"></a><span class="headword">Comm&aacute;n mac F&aacute;elchon</span> <span class="st"> [Mo Chomm&oacute;c]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 747), patron saint of Roscommon, whose feast day was 26 December. Comm&aacute;n belonged to the Sogain, a vassal people, one of whose territories lay to the south of Roscommon. Although his pedigree gave him no special advantage, Comm&aacute;n's church was placed to best advantage, on the southern edge of Mag nA&iacute; and thus close to the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute;. Roscommon rapidly became one of the most favoured churches of the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in, as shown by the succession of laws of Comm&aacute;n promulgated in the second half of the eighth century. These edicts were proclaimed in the province of Connacht by the combined authority of the provincial king of the Connachta (by then almost always of the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in) and of a leading churchman. To judge by these laws or edicts (<i>c&aacute;nai</i>, <i>rechtgai</i>), Roscommon occupied a more central position than Clonfert enjoyed in the affairs of Connacht in the two generations before the viking attacks began at the end of the eighth century. It was also more central than an U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in church close to the Shannon, Cluain Coirpthe, the church of <a name="cosubject_64420"></a><span class="headword">Berach mac Amargin</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th&#150;early 7th cent.), whose feast day was 15 February, and who, unlike Comm&aacute;n, was himself said to belong to the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in, but to a not particularly powerful branch, Cen&eacute;l nDobtha.<br>
<br>Surprisingly, no life of Comm&aacute;n survives, whereas there is a life of the other principal eighth-century Connacht saint, the Englishman <a name="cosubject_10546"></a><span class="headword">Garald <span class="st"> [Garalt, Gerald]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 732) of Mayo. Mayo had been founded by Colm&aacute;n, bishop of Northumbria from 661 to 664, and founder also of Inishbofin off the west coast of Connacht. Mayo was intended for Colm&aacute;n's English monks, who had followed him from Northumbria. It remained an English community, as indicated by its Irish name, Mag n&Eacute;o na Saxan (&#145;Mayo of the English&#146;), by letters to the community written by Alcuin (<i>d</i>. 804), and by its inclusion within the province of York for the purposes of the legatine synod of 786. Garald, however, was remembered more by the Irish than by the English: his feast day is given variously as 12 or 13 March in the martyrologies of Tallaght, Gorman, and Donegal; his life was included in a late medieval collection deriving from the Shannon borderlands of Connacht. Its highly confused chronology and anachronisms suggest a late date, but it helps to add to the evidence for the enduring importance of the church of Mayo after the viking period, an importance attested by the remains of a round tower. Moreover the English character of the early community was evidently remembered as late as the post-Norman period.<h2>
<a name="Femalesaints"></a>Female saints</h2>Connacht, like other provinces of Ireland, had its share of local cults of female saints. <a name="cosubject_64421"></a><span class="headword">Athracht ingen Thal&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>500), whose feast day is 11 August, was said by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n to have received the veil from St Patrick. She was the principal saint of the Gregraige Locha Techet (Lough Gara), on the borders of Roscommon and Sligo. Her church was Killaraght (Cell Athrachtae) on the east side of the lough, but another important site was her well, Toberaraght, on the west side. Her cult sites thus straddled this minor kingdom. Another local saint attached to St Patrick by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, and thus believed to be of early date, was <a name="cosubject_64422"></a><span class="headword">Lall&oacute;c</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.) of Senles, or Ard Senlis, whose feast day was 6 February. Her church is represented by the modern townland of Kildalloge (Cell Lall&oacute;c) in the parish of Kiltrustan on the west slopes of Slieve Baune, north-east of Roscommon. To judge by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n she was the major saint of a small vassal kingdom lying on the eastern edge of Mag nA&iacute;. On the other hand, the church of <a name="cosubject_64424"></a><span class="headword">Cairech Dergain</span>  (<em>d.</em> 577/9), whose feast day is 9 February, lay in a much more powerful kingdom. She was the patron saint of the church of Cloonburren, almost opposite Clonmacnoise but a little further down the Shannon. Her church thus lay within the important kingdom of the U&iacute; Maini. In spite of the rival attractions offered them by such cults as those of Brendan of Clonfert, Ciar&aacute;n of Clonmacnoise, and Brigit of Kildare, Cairech Dergain retained a particular role for the women of the U&iacute; Maini; according to their fourteenth-century customs, the queen of the U&iacute; Maini owed seven garments each year to Cairech Dergain and a penny was owed by every girl. In this case, therefore, a female saint was not the principal saint of a minor kingdom, but became a saint specifically for the women of a much larger kingdom.<br>
