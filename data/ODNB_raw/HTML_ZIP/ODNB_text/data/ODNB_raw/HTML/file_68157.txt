<span class="headword">Chamber <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hall]</span>,  Grace</span>  (1676&#150;1762), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born on 15 October 1676 at Monk Hesledon, co. Durham, the only child of James Hall and his second wife, Grace, widow of Anthony Pearson and daughter of Thomas and Grace Lamplough. Her father and his first wife, Frances Walker, had five other children. Brought up in an established Quaker household Grace was intelligent and &#145;endowed with an excellent understanding&#146;  (Testimony of Kendal monthly meeting). Although not formally educated she managed to acquire considerable medical skill, which she put to good use without ever asking for a fee or other reward. On 13 January 1704, when she was twenty-seven, Grace married Robert Chamber (<i>d</i>. 1753), a substantial Friend, and moved to his family home at Sedgwick, near Kendal, in Westmorland. At the age of thirty-five she was recognized as having a gift of ministry among Friends, although she did not speak frequently or at length. Her travel in the ministry was mainly local and in the company of her husband.<br>
<br>Grace Chamber had an extensive acquaintance among all classes in her local community and she concerned herself with the lives of her friends. She arranged for the widowed Abiah Sinclair, a fellow Quaker minister, to meet the ironmaster Abraham Darby (1711&#150;1763), who became Abiah's second husband, and she remained a constant friend to the whole Darby family. There is no record that Grace and Robert had any children of their own but Grace acted as a mother, nurse, and friend to all who needed her. Robert supported her ministry and her benevolent and medical activities up to a point. After his death in April 1753 she said of him:<blockquote>[although] one of the best of husbands, he was very unwilling to want me, but I think he made that up as much as any man in his circumstance could have done in letting his house be free and open to sick and lame, poor and rich. If I were but there it was mostly well. (Grace Chamber to J. Wilson, 18 Oct 1753, RS Friends, Lond., MS 334/63)</blockquote>Grace was aware of links between the physical, mental, and spiritual; she sent Thomas Story (1670?&#150;1742), a travelling minister who visited the area in 1715, not only religious encouragement but a sample of a powder as a remedy for coughing and shortness of breath, which she thought he might need. Another who benefited from Grace's benevolence was Frances Henshaw (1714&#150;1793), a convert to Quakerism from the established church. She was rejected by her family and became a Quaker minister, but was criticized by some Friends for her popularity. By 1743 she had reached a point of physical and mental collapse. Grace took Frances into her home for an extended period, giving her rest, good advice, and fresh- and salt-water baths so that eventually she recovered and continued her ministry.<br>
<br>In her widowhood Grace Chamber continued to travel in the ministry, often with her lifelong friend Lydia Lancaster. Together they visited the Darby family at Coalbrookdale and attended local Quaker meetings. In 1760, at the very end of their lives, they went on a more extensive journey, first to Welsh yearly meeting, as they often had before, but then on to Bath, Bristol, and London. Contemporaries wondered at their taking on so much when so advanced in years but characterized them both as &#145;green in old age&#146;. On her return Grace became more infirm, finding it difficult to get even to local Quaker meetings. She died on 22 September 1762, aged eighty-five, at Sedgwick, in the house to which she had come on her marriage nearly sixty years before; she was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Preston Patrick, Westmorland.<br>
<br>Grace Chamber was not an eloquent minister or an extensive traveller in the ministry, and she wrote nothing for publication. She was notable as a companion and friend, one who tended the sick and cared for those who were sorrowful and troubled in mind. She shared her wisdom and her skills freely and was universally valued by her local and religious community. In the letters, diaries, and journals of contemporaries she emerges as &#145;dear Grace&#146;&#151;a fitting memorial.<br>
