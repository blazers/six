<span class="headword">Chillenden,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1411), <span class="occ">prior of Christ Church, Canterbury</span>, was of unknown origins, though his family doubtless took its name from Chillenden in Kent. Professed a monk in the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1365, he attended Canterbury College at Oxford, becoming a bachelor of canon law by 1378. He then studied canon law at the Roman curia, receiving the degree of DCnL by 1383. He himself compiled an index to the fourth book of the <span class="italic">Decretals</span> of Gregory IX (<span class="italic">Repertorium quarti libri decretalium</span>) and gave lectures on the fourth book of the <span class="italic">Clementines</span> (&#145;<i>Reportata</i> on the Clementines&#146;). These are bound together in Oxford, All Souls College, MS 53. This document has not attracted much scholarly interest, but may be of significance, as indicating the interest of English canonists in marriage law. He also wrote a commentary on the <span class="italic">Regulae juris</span>  (Longleat, MS 35, fols. 187&#150;206). During his priorate the monks added to the library twenty-four writings dealing with canon law and another eleven works concerning civil law. But a work entitled <span class="italic">Repertorium sexti libri decretalium</span>  (BL, Royal MS 2 C.), which has been attributed to Chillenden, is in fact by a monk named John, and appears to be one of the books acquired during his priorate.<br>
<br>Chillenden served as one of the treasurers of the convent, before being elected prior in 1391. In his first year as prior he restarted the building of the nave of the cathedral church that had been halted after the murder of Archbishop Simon Sudbury in 1381. It took nine years to complete, and is now regarded as one of the supreme triumphs of English Perpendicular architecture. In addition Chillenden pursued an active policy of urban investment. In London the priory acquired the houses and shops that had formerly belonged to Robert Little, and built new shops within the city and at Southwark. At Canterbury new buildings were put up in Burgate and Stourstreet; a new inn called The Crown was purchased and another, exceptionally large, inn, The Chequers, was constructed. At the same time extensive repairs were undertaken on the priory manors, and new barns, granaries, and stables were erected, many with tiled roofs. Nineteen mills&#151;both water- and fulling-mills&#151;were either newly constructed or extensively repaired. Within the monastery precincts Chillenden was largely responsible for the restoration of the chapter house, the making of a new altar with a silver-gilt table that weighed 903 lb, and extensive improvements to the prior's lodging and chapel and to other monastic buildings. A century after his death John Leland described him as &#145;the greatest builder&#146; among the priors  (<span class="italic">John Leland's Itinerary</span>, 248). That seems an accurate assessment, although Henry Eastry (<i>d</i>. 1331) must have been a close rival.<br>
<br>After he became prior, Chillenden sought to retain some control over the finances of the monastery. He did not give up his position of treasurer, but combined it with that of the prior. Thus all the income from the manors, oblations, and other sources, came into his office, and he then gave the obedientaries&#151;such as the cellarer and the sacrist&#151;sufficient revenues to meet their responsibilities. He also reorganized the priory's system of leasing its manors, but it is not true, as R. A. L. Smith believes, that Chillenden was responsible for suddenly and swiftly ending a long policy of direct exploitation of priory estates. After the black death the monks had experimented with a variety of ways to manage their estates, moving back and forth between leasing and direct management. In the 1380s a number of east Kent manors had been taken back &#145;in hand&#146; and were being directly managed by priory servants, but other manors continued to be leased. Chillenden subsequently leased out the east Kent manors, but for fixed quantities of grain and stock, not money rents.<br>
<br>Chillenden was occasionally involved in national affairs. In 1383 he served as proctor for the University of Oxford in a dispute with St Frideswide's Priory. He was appointed by the crown one of the commissioners to inquire about the goods of Gueldres merchants in England. He was the last prior of Canterbury to attend parliament and was summoned by Richard II to the council held at Oxford in 1399, which advised the king regarding the papal schism. In 1404 he was elected bishop of Rochester, but refused to accept episcopal office. He attended the church council at Pisa in 1409 as representative of the crown as well as of the Canterbury convent. He died on 15 August 1411, and before his death had become so emaciated that his skin would scarcely cover his bones.<br>
