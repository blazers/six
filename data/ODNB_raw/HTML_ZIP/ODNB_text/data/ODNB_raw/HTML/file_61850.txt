<span class="headword">Aldridge,  Amanda Christina Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Montague Ring]</span>  (1866&#150;1956), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was born on 10 March 1866 at Luranah Villa, Hamlet Road, Penge, Surrey, the second of three daughters and third of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49697/', "Ira Frederick Aldridge (1807?&#150;1867)")</script>, the distinguished African-American tragedian, and his second wife, Swedish opera singer Amanda Pauline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Brandt (<i>d</i>. 1915). Ira Aldridge died on tour in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, Poland, on 7 August 1867, leaving his widow with three young children: Irene 
    (Luranah; 1860&#150;1932)
  , Ira Frederick (1862&#150;1886), and Amanda. A fourth, Rachel Margaret Frederika (<i>b</i>. 1868), was born after her father's death. The Aldridge children showed great musical promise from childhood and their mother encouraged them to have a sense of pride in their African heritage. In honour of her father Amanda added the name Ira to her own. She and her elder sister, Luranah, were educated at a convent school in Belgium. One of her earliest appearances as a singer was at a concert in Crystal Palace in 1881, when she sang Beethoven's &#145;Creation's hymn&#146; and a ballad. Two years later, at the age of seventeen, she won a foundation scholarship to the newly opened Royal College of Music, where she studied singing (from 1883 to 1887) with Jenny Lind, known as the Swedish Nightingale, and Sir George Henschel. She was also a pupil of Dame Madge Kendal, who had played Desdemona to her father's Othello in 1865.<br>
<br>For many years Amanda Aldridge enjoyed success as a contralto, and often appeared with her brother, Ira Frederick, as her accompanist until his early death in 1886. In June 1905, after hearing a recital at Steinway Hall, a reviewer in <span class="italic">The Times</span> wrote:<blockquote>Miss Ira Aldridge held the attention of a large audience on Saturday afternoon &hellip; Dvorak's gipsy songs call for the exercise of a great deal of art &hellip; Miss Aldridge's style is excellent, her voice warm and mellow, and her intelligence far beyond dispute; the combination may well serve to explain the measure of her success.</blockquote>When her singing career ended after an attack of laryngitis damaged her throat, Aldridge remembered what Jenny Lind had once told her:&#145;Never mind what happens to your throat. &hellip; You can always earn a livelihood as a singing teacher, because you have a good insight into voice theory and practice&#146;.<br>
<br>Until she died Amanda Aldridge played an important part in the musical life of London's black middle class: after her singing career had ended she turned her attention to composing and teaching voice production and piano. She started composing when she was in her thirties and always published under the name Montague Ring, to separate her work as a composer from that as singer and instructor. She composed love songs, suites, sambas, and light orchestral pieces. Sophie Fuller summed up her work as a composer thus:<blockquote>Most of her music is in a popular style, often using syncopated dance rhythms. Her best-known work is <span class="italic">Three African Dances</span> (1913) &hellip; The slow, central movement, &#145;Luleta's Dance&#146;, uses themes reminiscent of music from West Africa &hellip; Aldridge also published over 25 songs [and] wrote her own words for many of her earliest songs. (Fuller, 37)</blockquote>As a teacher, Aldridge's singing pupils included three distinguished African-Americans: tenor Roland Hayes, contralto Marian Anderson, and Paul Robeson. Hayes went on to perform her songs throughout England and Europe. In 1925 she befriended the African-American singer and actor Paul Robeson and his wife, Eslanda, when they visited London. That same year she composed music for the poem &#145;Summah is de lovin' Time&#146;, written by the African-American Paul Laurence Dunbar, and dedicated it to the Robesons. She also presented Robeson with the ear-rings her father had worn on stage as Othello, expressing the hope that he would one day wear them when he too played the role. After settling in London in 1928, Robeson turned to Aldridge for elocution lessons before making his first appearance as Othello at London's Savoy Theatre with Peggy Ashcroft in 1930.<br>
<br>Although Aldridge appears to have stopped writing (or at least publishing) music by the end of the 1920s, she continued to teach and play an important part in musical life. She never married, partly because&#151;in addition to her teaching work and composition&#151;she had to look after her elderly, bedridden mother, who died in 1915, and her sister Luranah, whose own musical career had ended when she developed severe rheumatism. Luranah spent the last twenty years of her life as an invalid, before killing herself in 1932.<br>
<br>When Bermuda-born actor Earl Cameron began his professional career in Britain in the 1940s, there were few openings for young black actors in drama schools. On the advice of a friend, he turned to Aldridge for help. Much later he recalled:<blockquote>Miss Aldridge was about eighty at this time but still giving elocution lessons and instructing people in voice projection. She was light-skinned, rather short and stocky. She was a lovely, well-spoken, delicate and dignified lady with a tremendous sense of humour. She could laugh about most things. She was a courteous, beautiful human being, but not wealthy. I had the highest regard for her, and we got on extremely well. She helped me tremendously and I continued having lessons with her for at least two years. She told me all about her father, and showed me pictures of him. She did not like Herbert Marshall who later published a biography of her father. She didn't have a high opinion of Paul Robeson, either. She had given Robeson elocution lessons when he was preparing for his first appearance as Othello at the Savoy. She helped him greatly but, in later years, she was hurt when he failed to give her any credit. (Bourne, 156&#150;7)</blockquote>Aldridge died the day before her ninetieth birthday, in 1956, at Cave Hill Hospital in Coulsdon, Surrey. She was buried in an unmarked grave in Streatham Park cemetery.<br>
