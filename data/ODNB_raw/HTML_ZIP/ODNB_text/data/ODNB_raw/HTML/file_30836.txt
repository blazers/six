</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boulting,  John Edward</span>  (1913&#150;1985), <span class="occ">film producer and director</span>, and <a name="cosubject_76431"></a><span class="headword">Roy Alfred Clarence Boulting</span>  (1913&#150;2001), also a <span class="occ">film producer and director</span>, were born identical twin brothers (John thirty minutes before Roy) at Brookmead, Bray, Berkshire, on 21 December 1913 (though both twins gave as their date of birth 21 November 1913, in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> and elsewhere). They were the sons of (Walter) Arthur Boulting, prospector for a mining company, later a financial consultant, of Hove, Sussex, and his wife, Rosetta (Rose), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett. An elder brother, Sydney, later became well known as the actor and theatrical producer Peter Cotes; while a younger brother, Guy, died at the age of eight. John Boulting was at first named Joseph Edward John Boulting, but soon adopted the name John Edward. Roy was originally given the forenames Alfred Fitzroy Clarence. The twins were educated at Reading School, where they were active at sports and in the dramatic and debating societies. They developed an unconventional interest in the cinema, forming one of the first film societies in a public school, and were extras on Anthony Asquith's <span class="italic">Tell England</span> (1931).<h2>
<a name="Apprenticeshipsandwartimefilmmaking"></a>Apprenticeships and wartime film-making</h2>In 1933 John Boulting was the first brother to enter the film profession, initially with Ace Films, a small film distribution company owned by a schoolfriend's father and based in Wardour Street, London; he later described this period of his life in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry as one of &#145;selling bad films to reluctant exhibitors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, 1985). In 1935 he joined a modest independent producer and gained much experience in small studios. Roy, meanwhile, was trying his luck in Canada where, among other jobs, he spent some time with a film production company in Trenton, Ontario. He returned to England in the mid-1930s as a crew-member on a cattle ship and also found work in Wardour Street in film sales, but later transferred to production at the Marylebone studios as an assistant editor.<br>
<br>Early in 1937 John Boulting volunteered as a front-line ambulance driver for the International Brigade in Spain, and was involved in the later stages of the battle of Guadalajara and the offensives of Brunete and Balchite. On his return in November 1937 he and Roy formed Charter Films, and began a long career of independent film production in Britain with the documentary <span class="italic">Ripe Earth</span> (1937). With Roy directing and John producing, the company also put out a handful of modest thrillers such as <span class="italic">Consider your Verdict</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Trunk Crime</span> (1939), &#145;quota quickies&#146; that were picked up by renters to meet the legal obligation to distribute a quota of British films.<br>
<br>The Boulting brothers came to prominence in the early war years with their adaptation of the anti-Nazi play <span class="italic">Pastor Hall</span> (1940), based on the humanist resistance of Pastor Martin Niem&ouml;ller. They entered the services in that year: John went into the RAF as a flight mechanic and Roy into the Royal Armoured Corps as a trooper. Eventually the authorities saw sense and put the brothers to better use, transferring them to their respective service film units, where they contributed significantly to wartime documentary. Roy eventually reached the rank of captain in the army film unit and supervised the Academy award-winning <span class="italic">Desert Victory</span> (1943) and its companion <span class="italic">Burma Victory</span> (1945); John ended the war a flight lieutenant and directed his first film for the RAF film unit, the feature-length drama documentary <span class="italic">Journey Together</span> (1945). In 1941&#150;2, while the arrangements to establish the service film units at Pinewood studios were under way, the brothers were granted special leave to return to Charter Films and produced the propaganda film <span class="italic">The Dawn Guard</span> (1941) for the Ministry of Information and the feature film <span class="italic">Thunder Rock</span> (1942). The Boultings' wartime cinema was progressive, moralistic, and strongly anti-fascist, with their films promoting the democratic ideals of the people's war and rejecting the discredited appeasement policy of the 1930s. Their achievements were widely recognized and they became identified with the renaissance in British cinema, which was felt to have attained a new maturity and honesty in confronting the national crisis.<h2>
<a name="Postwarcareers"></a>Post-war careers</h2>Following the war the Boulting brothers continued to operate as an independent producer&#150;director team, but found it necessary to produce in association with a variety of film companies, with the brothers alternating roles as director and producer. A series of adaptations ensued: Roy directed <span class="italic">Fame is the Spur</span> (1947), about the moral compromises of a Labour politician, and <span class="italic">The Guinea Pig</span> (1948), about a working-class boy (played by Richard Attenborough) adapting to life in a public school. The themes reflected the Boultings' preoccupation with political and social issues. John directed <span class="italic">Brighton Rock</span> (1947), a moody and effective thriller also starring Attenborough, who was under contract to the brothers. The twins collaborated in directing <span class="italic">Seven Days to Noon</span> (1950), the first film to deal with the moral implications of the atom bomb, which won an Academy award for the original story provided by Paul Dehn and James Bernard.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s the Boulting brothers worked separately again. John was invited to direct <span class="italic">The Magic Box</span> (1951), the British film industry's principal contribution to the Festival of Britain, telling the life of cinema pioneer William Friese-Greene, leaving Roy to make the cold war thriller <span class="italic">High Treason</span> (1951), which was already in an advanced stage of preparation. Beginning in 1953, the Boultings worked both separately and collaboratively on productions for American producers. Roy directed <span class="italic">Singlehanded</span> (1953) for Twentieth Century Fox; he and John co-directed <span class="italic">Seagulls over Sorrento</span> (1954) for MGM; and Roy directed <span class="italic">Run for the Sun</span> (1956) for Russ-Field Productions, the only Boulting brothers project to be made in the United States.<br>
<br>The mid-1950s saw the Boulting brothers make a decisive turn to comedy. While <span class="italic">Josephine and the Men</span> was the first to appear, in 1955, much more significant was <span class="italic">Private's Progress</span>, directed and co-scripted by John in 1956. This was a hugely popular satire of army life that assembled a cast consisting of Ian Carmichael, Richard Attenborough, Terry-Thomas, and sundry others who generally appeared as the same or similar characters in successive comedies satirizing the legal profession (<span class="italic">Brothers in Law</span>, 1957), universities (<span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span>, 1957), the Foreign Office (<span class="italic">Carlton-Browne of the FO</span>, 1958), industrial relations (<span class="italic">I'm All Right Jack</span>, 1959) and the church (<span class="italic">Heavens Above!</span>, 1963). <span class="italic">I'm All Right Jack</span> won BAFTA awards for best screenplay (written by John Boulting, Frank Harvey, and Alan Hackney) and best actor for Peter Sellers, who was reinvented by his performance as the belligerent shop steward Fred Kite from comedian to comic actor of the first rank. The film was among the most popular British productions of the year, but attracted severe criticism from the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians (ACTT) for what it interpreted as a negative portrayal of trade unionists. The Boultings had been in dispute with the ACTT for many years regarding what they saw as the restrictive practices operated against them, resulting from their combined status of executives and technicians. (The union argued that as executives the brothers should not act also as editors or cameramen.) Legal action was finally settled in 1964.<br>
<br>If the social awareness of the Boultings' comedies of the 1950s anticipated the satire boom of the early 1960s, the brothers were not part of the critically celebrated new wave British cinema of the same period. Only later in the decade, with <span class="italic">The Family Way</span> (1966), a pointed comedy of generational conflict with permissive leanings, did the Boultings connect with the kitchen sink school of realism. The film came after John's final solo directorial effort, the modest comedy <span class="italic">Rotten to the Core</span> (1965). Roy continued as the team's director and embarked on a series of more adult-oriented pictures, in keeping with a firm trend in commercial film-making: he directed the controversial psychological thriller <span class="italic">Twisted Nerve</span> (1968), which the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children disliked for its portrayal of a child with Down's syndrome, and two sex comedies that largely failed to capitalize on the (admittedly fading) star appeal of Peter Sellers: <span class="italic">There's a Girl in my Soup</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">Soft Beds, Hard Battles</span> (1973). The Boulting brothers' high-profile career in the British film industry effectively came to an end with the latter. Roy intermittently undertook directorial assignments, such as <span class="italic">The Last Word</span> (1979) for the Suncrest Cinema Corporation in Hollywood, and an episode of the <span class="italic">Miss Marple</span> television series, &#145;The Moving Finger&#146;, for the BBC in 1985. Roy also co-authored with Leo Marks (who had scripted <span class="italic">Twisted Nerve</span>) the play <span class="italic">Favourites</span>, which was produced in 1977.<br>
<br>John and Roy Boulting exemplified independent film production in British cinema. They had a long association with the &#145;third force&#146; in British film distribution, British Lion; both brothers were directors of the company, although John took a more executive role, serving as managing director from 1966 to 1972. The brothers were persistent in criticizing the Rank Organisation and Associated British Corporation duopoly which exercised a stranglehold over cinema distribution and exhibition, and offered what support and encouragement they could to struggling independent film-makers. John was part of the successful effort to get broadcasters to pay higher fees to film producers for screening films on television.<h2>
<a name="Marriages"></a>Marriages</h2>John Boulting married four times. His first wife was Veronica Davide Davidson (<i>b</i>. 1916/17), a student, daughter of John Craig Nelson Davidson, barrister, whom he married on 20 July 1938. That marriage ended in divorce and on 27 February 1952 he married Jacqueline Helen Duncan (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), daughter of Richard Chilver Robert Rice Allerton, a broker at Lloyds, and divorced wife of William Raymond Duncan. Once again divorced, Boulting married Ann Marion, daughter of Alan Ware, of the Royal Marines, in 1972. Finally, he married Anne Josephine, daughter of Frank Flynn, sales manager, in 1977. He and his first wife had two sons, and with his second he had three daughters. He also had another son.<br>
<br>Roy Boulting married five times. His first wife was (Marian) Angela Warnock, whom he married in 1936. That marriage ended in divorce in 1941 and on 30 December 1943 he married Jean Nora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gamage, divorced wife of Charles Kenneth Capon and daughter of Eric Muir Gamage, company director. By the time of the marriage she had changed her surname to Boulting. Divorced again in 1951, on 24 March that year he married Enid Munnick, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Groenewald, divorced wife of Cornelius Francis Munnick and daughter of Jacobus Linde Groenewald, farmer. The marriage was dissolved in 1964, and she later became countess of Hardwicke. For a period in the mid-1960s he lived with Victoria Vaughan. His marriage in 1971 to Hayley Catherine Rose Vivian Mills (<i>b</i>. 1946), the young star of <span class="italic">The Family Way</span> and <span class="italic">Twisted Nerve</span>, created headlines, but ended in divorce in 1978. Finally, on 30 October 1978 he married the actress Sandra Spencer (formerly Lerner), daughter of Gilbert Spencer Payne, civil servant. They divorced in 1984. Roy Boulting had seven sons: two from his second marriage, three from his third, one son with Victoria Vaughan, and one son from his fourth marriage. The latter, Crispian Mills, became lead singer in the pop group Kula Shaker and experienced a very public rapprochement with his father in the late 1990s.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>John and Roy Boulting gained critical recognition early in their career with the release of <span class="italic">Pastor Hall</span>. Their subsequent wartime films set certain standards and expectations, and shaped the critical response towards the brothers' later films. This period marked them out as socially committed or, in the words of one critic, &#145;earnest evangelicals&#146;  (Durgnat, <span class="italic">A Mirror</span>, 234): men who propagated the values of the people's war and the people's peace. Critical reception cooled in the immediate post-war years when, at best, their films were seen as worthy failures (such as <span class="italic">Fame is the Spur</span>) or dismissed in some quarters as sordid affairs (such as <span class="italic">Brighton Rock</span>). A progressive &#145;moral disenchantment&#146;  (ibid., 42) was seen to descend over the Boultings, leading to a &#145;dissolution of idealism and a critical tone about the state of postwar society&#146;  (Landy, 35). Their cold war thrillers <span class="italic">Seven Days to Noon</span> and <span class="italic">High Treason</span> marked a new intensity in this dissatisfaction: both films were judged by many critics as excessively paranoid, with narratives drifting towards an increasing reliance on authority. The satirical comedies of the 1950s were in this view a straightforward index of the brothers' increasing cynicism and bitterness and could be dismissed (by Penelope Houston) as the work of &#145;sour Liberals&#146;  (Burton and others, 4) (John had joined the Liberal Party in the 1950s). Moreover, critics became increasingly hostile to a perceived vulgarity in the Boultings' films and a certain low approach to humour, which reached its nadir in <span class="italic">Soft Beds, Hard Battles</span>. Raymond Durgnat, though, has warned against this view of &#145;moral abdication&#146; by the Boultings and has defended the brothers' comedic approach as &#145;a deliberate moral position&#146;, entirely consistent with the idealism of their wartime productions. While this idealism might well have been dented by the social and moral laxity and the compromises brought on by the onset of affluence in the mid-1950s, it was also capable of &#145;an affectionate enjoyment of humanity despite its moral mediocrity and without the guilt of stereotypical puritanism&#146;  (Durgnat, &#145;Boulting, Roy and John&#146;, 101). By the end of the twentieth century the brothers' output was enjoying something of a critical rehabilitation.<br>
<br>The Boulting brothers' careers in British cinema marked them out as mavericks. They displayed a single-minded dedication to their craft and developed a reputation, in the words of Roy, of being a couple of &#145;toffee-nosed bastards, arrogant, opinionated, inflexible, difficult&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). It was no coincidence that their films focused on the misfit figure of the dissident idealist, coming to the fore in the early war features <span class="italic">Pastor Hall</span> and <span class="italic">Thunder Rock</span>, with their men of conscience actively opposed to the horrors of fascism; this figure was presented again in <span class="italic">The Guinea Pig</span>, the tale of a working-class lad's transformation into an exemplary public schoolboy, and, in a different register, in the gullible innocent played by Ian Carmichael in several comedies, most notably the Stanley Windrush character in <span class="italic">Private's Progress</span> and <span class="italic">I'm All Right Jack</span>, whose noble ideal of service is exploited by the opportunistic rogues of a self-serving society. The Boultings strove for a degree of control over their film-making rare in the British film industry. In most cases they chose their projects, had a hand in the scripts, alternated shooting responsibilities on the studio floor, and on occasion edited the films themselves. It was a commonly held view that they were interchangeable, even indivisible, as film-makers; indeed, they were known to exchange roles on set without the crew even noticing.<br>
<br>Both brothers had a passion for cricket and a full set of cricket gear was always kept in the prop van ready for an impromptu game should the sun go in and halt filming. John died of cancer on 17 June 1985 at his home, 5 The Ridge, Ridgemount Road, Sunningdale, Berkshire. This was a devastating blow for his twin brother, who was left to spend many frustrated years unsuccessfully trying to adapt Terence Rattigan's last play <span class="italic">Cause C&eacute;l&egrave;bre</span> for the screen. Roy, living in his later years in a council flat in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, died of cancer at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 5 November 2001.<br>
