<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  Peter Markham</span>  (1909&#150;1989), <span class="occ">painter, ornithologist, and broadcaster</span>, was born at 174 Buckingham Palace Road, London, on 14 September 1909, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35994/', "Captain Robert Falcon Scott (1868&#150;1912)")</script>, Antarctic explorer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34283/', "(Edith Agnes) Kathleen Scott (1878&#150;1947)")</script>, sculptor, daughter of Canon Lloyd Stewart Bruce. His father died in 1912 and in 1922 his mother married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37071/', "Edward Hilton Young")</script>, who became first Baron Kennet. There was one son of this marriage. In his last message home before he died Scott had urged his wife to make his son interested in natural history, which was better than sport. In the event, Peter Scott came to excel at both. He was an energetic child, with a passion for natural history, who spent much time drawing and painting. He also shone at sports, ice-skating, and sailing in small boats. From his preparatory school, West Downs, he went to Oundle. He then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1927 to 1930, where he hoped to take the natural sciences tripos, but failed his part one in 1930. He stayed on for an extra term and obtained an ordinary degree in December 1930 (zoology, botany, and history of art). During his Cambridge days he took up wildfowling, and in 1929 <span class="italic">Country Life</span> magazine printed two articles on the sport written and illustrated by him.<br>
<br>From Cambridge Scott went to the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste in Munich for a term, and then spent two years at the Royal Academy Schools in London. In 1933 he held his first one-man exhibition, which was a huge success, at Ackermann's Galleries in London. He was able to make his living as a painter of wildfowl, producing his first book (entitled <span class="italic">Morning Flight</span> and published by <span class="italic">Country Life</span>) in 1935. This was followed by <span class="italic">Wild Chorus</span> in 1938. Lavishly illustrated with his paintings, both books became very popular and ran to twelve editions.<br>
<br>Scott excelled at sailing and won a bronze medal in the 1936 Olympic games, for single-handed yachting. He also won the prestigious Prince of Wales cup for international 14 foot dinghies in 1937, 1938, and 1946. In the late 1950s he developed a passion for gliding, and won the British gliding championships in 1963.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1939 Scott volunteered for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After training he spent two years in destroyers, mainly in HMS <i>Broke</i> in the western approaches, becoming her first lieutenant, and then he served in the coastal forces in steam gunboats. He became senior officer of the flotilla, was awarded a DSC (1943) and bar, and was thrice mentioned in dispatches. He also invented a night camouflage scheme for naval ships. His final appointment was the command of a new frigate, as a lieutenant-commander. With the war coming to a close, Scott was adopted as the Conservative candidate for Wembley North, but he failed to be elected by 435 votes, having had only two weeks to prepare for the election.<br>
<br>While visiting the River Severn at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire in 1945, in search of a rare lesser white-fronted goose among the wintering greater white-fronted geese, Scott decided to establish a research organization, which he had planned for many years, to study the swans, geese, and ducks of the world. The Severn Wildfowl Trust was set up at Slimbridge in 1946 and soon boasted the largest collection of wildfowl in the world. Later known as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, it expanded into nine centres around Britain. Scott remained its honorary director until he died. Scientific research took him to Iceland in 1951 to study pink-footed geese on their breeding grounds, and to the Perry River region of northern Canada, where in 1949 he mapped this unknown area while in search of the breeding grounds of the Ross goose. Scott did more than any British contemporary to save wildlife species from extinction.<br>
<br>When the BBC founded a television centre in Bristol Scott helped to establish the natural history unit there, planning a programme on natural history called <span class="italic">Look</span>, which he hosted for seventeen years. Many of the early programmes contained his own film which he shot on his travels. He took part in <span class="italic">Nature Parliament</span>, a radio programme which ran for twenty-one years, and was the narrator in many other programmes.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Scott became involved with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. He helped build up the species survival commission of the union and was chairman in 1962&#150;81. With two friends, in 1961 he founded the World Wildlife Fund (later the World Wide Fund for Nature) to raise the money needed to finance nature conservation around the world. As its chairman from 1961, he designed its panda logo and invented the red data books listing endangered species. He travelled abroad extensively on behalf of the fund, establishing national appeals, advising on conservation issues and areas for reserves, lecturing, and fund-raising. He was also involved in numerous other conservation and naturalist societies. He became as much of an expert on coral fish as he was on birds and his records have proved scientifically useful.<br>
<br>Scott's autobiography, <span class="italic">The Eye of the Wind</span>, was published in 1961 and was reprinted many times. He was a prolific author and illustrator, his final books being the three volumes of <span class="italic">Travel Diaries of a Naturalist</span> (1983&#150;7).<br>
<br>Scott was elected rector of Aberdeen University, 1960&#150;63, and appointed chancellor of Birmingham University, 1974&#150;83. Appointed MBE in 1942 and CBE in 1953, he was knighted in 1973. In 1987 he became both CH and a fellow of the Royal Society. He had honorary degrees from the universities of Exeter, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Bath, Guelph, and Ulster. He was also awarded numerous medals, prizes, and foreign honours.<br>
<br>Strongly built and of average height, Scott was warm and friendly, tackling everything with enthusiasm. He liked to paint every day. In 1942 he married the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (1923&#150;2014), daughter of David Liddon Howard, timber merchant. They had a daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1951 and in August the same year he married <a href="#cosubject_103228">(Felicity) Philippa Talbot-Ponsonby [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had a daughter and a son. Peter Scott died from a heart attack in hospital in Bristol on 29 August 1989. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust reserve at Slimbridge. Memorial services were held in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 20 November 1989 and at the church of St John the Evangelist, Slimbridge, on 30 November.<br>
<br>Scott's second wife, <a name="cosubject_103228"></a><span class="headword">(Felicity) Philippa Scott <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Talbot-Ponsonby]</span></span>, Lady Scott  (1918&#150;2010), <span class="occ">photographer and conservationist</span>, was born on 22 November 1918 in Bloemfontein, South Africa, the younger daughter of Commander Frederick William Talbot-Ponsonby (1879&#150;1930), naval officer, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Findlay (1881&#150;1952). Her parents had moved to the Orange Free State to help her father recover from tuberculosis, and she was brought up on a farm there. The family returned frequently to England, and during the Second World War she worked first in the Land Army then at Bletchley Park. For a brief period after the war she worked at the British embassy in Belgrade, in the newly-Communist Yugoslavia. Returning to England in 1947, she saw an advertisement for a job as secretary to Peter Scott, and was duly taken on; she also became assistant secretary to the Severn Wildfowl Trust. She later remarked, with characteristic self-deprecation, that &#145;I think he appreciated the fact that I was basically a country girl and I knew how to round up ducks and geese without frightening them&#146;  (Wild Film History interview). She married Scott while on a bird-ringing expedition to Iceland. As well as becoming stepmother to Nicky Scott and bringing up her own two children with Scott, Dafila and Falcon, she was a constant source of support for her husband, and accompanied him on his many travels. Developing an interest in photography (she later became a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society), she illustrated his books, <span class="italic">Faraway Look</span>, 2 vols. (1960), <span class="italic">Animals in Africa</span> (1962), and the three volumes of <span class="italic">Travel Diaries of a Naturalist</span> (1983&#150;7). After his death she saw to publication <span class="italic">The Art of Peter Scott: Images from a Lifetime</span> (1991), and published two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">Lucky Me</span> (1990) and <span class="italic">So Many Sunlit Hours</span> (2002). She remained active in the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust as its honorary director until her death and continued to live at Slimbridge. She died at Moreton Hill Farm care centre, in Standish, Gloucestershire, of bronchopneumonia and heart failure on 6 January 2010, and was survived by her daughter, son, and stepdaughter.<br>
