<span class="headword">White,  Christopher</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1695?), <span class="occ">chemist and laboratory technician</span>, was probably born in Oxford, though his origins remain obscure. He is, however, known to be the boy &#145;Kitt&#146; who in 1663, with his (unnamed) father, assisted in the experimental chemistry courses given privately at Oxford by the German alchemist Peter Stahl, under the patronage of Robert Boyle. He remained a trainee assistant to Stahl for about three years, and then served as Boyle's assistant for ten years, moving to London with him in 1668.<br>
<br>Having returned to Oxford, White became on 21 April 1676 a privileged (tradesman) member of the university, championed by the mathematician John Wallis. His business was (and remained) making chemical medicines, but he was soon designated to run the university chemical laboratory projected as part of the Ashmolean Museum. Begun in 1679, the new institution was opened on 21 May 1683. White himself chose, and perhaps helped to design, some of its apparatus and furnaces.<br>
<br>As &#145;operator&#146;, or university chemist, White's main duty was to demonstrate experiments and techniques in extension of lectures by the professor of chemistry&#151;Robert Plot until 1689, and then Edward Hannes. The first course began in September 1683. In addition, White was authorized to run a public dispensary from the laboratory, where he maintained a storeroom of chemical preparations. He was also in charge of a small library, to which he presented his copy of Joannes Zwelfer's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia</span> (1653).<br>
<br>In 1686 White was one of the stewards of the Oxford and Oxfordshire feast, and when the university went in ceremonial procession to meet James II the following year he deputized for the superior bedel of arts. From at least 1688 he was an acquaintance of John Aubrey, who lodged with him whenever he visited Oxford. Among references to White in Aubrey's letters, mentions of &#145;a rare medicine that he hath for the stone&#146; (1689) and in 1694 of &#145;a good lusty vomit&#146;  (Powell, 209, 232) offer some insight into the nature of his pharmaceutical practice.<br>
<br>From an early age White had been moulded into a new kind of professional chemist, combining the skills of the alchemist, the apothecary, and the &#145;philosophical&#146; experimenter. This is reflected in his use of the new occupational title &#145;chemist&#146;. He inspired the creation of Oxford's earliest ancillary scientific post, becoming in effect the first professional laboratory technician. A contemporary account describes him as &#145;skilful and industrious&#146;. He did well financially, through the sale of medicines, yet there must have been disappointment, even before his untimely death, at the lack of real academic achievement in his laboratory.<br>
<br>With his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1724), White had two sons and two daughters. He trained both sons as chemist apothecaries, the older, Christopher, succeeding to his university post. No record of White's death or burial has survived. When he made his will in Oxford on 27 August 1695 he was already seriously ill, and he probably died shortly after. He was buried at St Cross Church, Oxford.<br>
