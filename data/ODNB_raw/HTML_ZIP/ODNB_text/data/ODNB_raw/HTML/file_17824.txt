<span class="headword">Maitland, Sir  Frederick Lewis</span>  (1777&#150;1839), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born at Rankeilour in Fife on 7 September 1777, was the third son of Captain <a name="cosubject_17823"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Lewis Maitland</span>  (1730&#150;1786)<span class="occ"></span>, sixth son of Charles, sixth earl of Lauderdale. Maitland's father, the godson of Frederick Louis, prince of Wales, commanded with distinction the <i>Lively</i> in 1760, the <i>Elizabeth</i> in 1778, and served under Rodney in 1782. Between 1763 and 1775 he commanded the royal yacht. He was promoted rear-admiral in 1786, but died before the news reached him. Maitland's mother was Margaret Dick (<i>d</i>. 1825), heir in tail general to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6697/', "James Crichton, Viscount Frendraught")</script>, who was heir of the family of Makgill of Rankeilour. Maitland's elder brother Charles (<i>d</i>. 1820) inherited the estates of his mother's family and assumed the surname Makgill; he and his wife, Mary Johnston, had a son David Maitland-Makgill-Crichton (1801&#150;1851), who assumed the name Crichton in 1837 as heir to his ancestor James Crichton. He was called to the Scottish bar in 1822, and took a prominent part in the formation of the Free Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Maitland joined the navy, and, after serving some time in the sloop <i>Martin</i> with Captain George Duff and with Robert Forbes in the frigate <i>Southampton</i>, in which he was present at the battle of 1 June 1794, he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Andromeda</i> on 3 April 1795. He was shortly afterwards moved into the <i>Venerable</i>, flagship of Admiral Duncan in the North Sea, and in April 1797 went out to the Mediterranean to join Lord St Vincent, by whom he was appointed to the sloop <i>Kingfisher</i>. In her he assisted at the capture of several privateers with such courage that the ship's company subscribed &pound;50 to present him with a sword. In December 1798 the <i>Kingfisher</i> was wrecked as she was leaving the Tagus. Maitland, who was in temporary command, was court-martialled and honourably acquitted. Immediately afterwards he was appointed flag lieutenant to Lord St Vincent, then residing at Gibraltar.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1799, as the combined fleets of France and Spain were retiring from the Mediterranean, Maitland was sent by St Vincent to order the hired cutter <i>Penelope</i> &#145;to go, count and dodge them&#146;. As the lieutenant of the cutter was sick, Maitland took the command, but the next day, owing, it was said, to the cowardice and disobedience of the men, the <i>Penelope</i> was captured by the Spaniards and taken into Cadiz. The Spanish admiral Mazaredo, having learned that her commander was the flag lieutenant of Lord St Vincent, to whom he was under some obligation of courtesy, sent Maitland back to Gibraltar free, without exchange. Maitland was promoted by St Vincent to be commander of the sloop <i>Cameleon</i>, the promotion backdated to 14 June; he went out to join his new ship, then on the coast of Egypt, under Sir Sidney Smith, and after the signing of the convention of al-&#145;Arish (24 January 1800) was sent home overland with dispatches. He returned almost immediately, and continued in the <i>Cameleon</i> to the end of the year. On 10 December 1800 he was appointed by Keith to be acting captain of the store ship <i>Wassenaar</i>. As she was then at Malta unfit for service, Maitland obtained permission to accompany the expedition to Egypt. His good service in command of the boats appointed to cover the landing of the army, and to support the right flank in the actions of 13 and 21 March 1801, was specially acknowledged by the commanders-in-chief, on the report of Sir Sidney Smith, and won for him his promotion to post rank, dated 21 March. Maitland was then appointed temporarily to the <i>Dragon</i> (74 guns), but in August was moved into the <i>Carr&egrave;re</i>, a recent prize from the French, which he took to England and paid off in October 1802.<br>
<br>St Vincent, then first lord of the Admiralty, immediately appointed Maitland to the <i>Loire</i>, a large 46 gun frigate, which, on the renewal of the war, was employed on the west coast of France and the north coast of Spain. In April 1804 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1865), second daughter of Daniel Connor of Ballybricken, co. Cork; their only child died in infancy.<br>
<br>During the three years after his appointment to the <i>Loire</i>, Maitland captured or destroyed many large privateers and coastal batteries, especially on 4 June 1805 in Muros Bay, south of Cape Finisterre, where his courage and success won him the thanks of the City of London, the freedom of Cork, and a sword from the Patriotic Fund. He also assisted in the capture of the French frigate <i>Libre</i> on 24 December 1805. In November 1806 he was moved into the frigate <i>Emerald</i> (36 guns), on the same service as the <i>Loire</i>, and with similar success. In April 1809 she was with the fleet outside Basque Roads, under Lord Gambier, and on the 12th was one of the few ships so tardily sent in to support the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i>.<br>
<br>In 1813 and 1814 Maitland commanded the <i>Goliath</i> (58 guns) on the Halifax and West Indian stations, and in November 1814 was appointed to the <i>Boyne</i> (98 guns) under orders for North America. At the beginning of 1815 he was collecting a fleet of transports and merchant ships in Cork harbour, but a succession of strong westerly winds prevented his sailing, until, on the news of Bonaparte's return from Elba, his orders were countermanded, and he was appointed to the <i>Bellerophon</i> (74 guns), in which he sailed from Plymouth on 24 May under the immediate orders of Sir Henry Hotham. Maitland, as well as Hotham, had a long experience of the Bay of Biscay, and the <i>Bellerophon</i> was stationed off Rochefort to keep watch on the ships of war there. On 28 June the news of Waterloo reached Maitland, and on the 30th a letter from Bordeaux warned him that Bonaparte would attempt to escape from there to America. Maitland, however, considered he would more probably make for Rochefort; and though he sent two small craft, one to Bordeaux and the other to Arcachon, he himself, in the <i>Bellerophon</i>, remained off Rochefort. Hotham, in the <i>Superb</i>, was in Quiberon Bay, and frigates, corvettes, and brigs kept watch along the whole extent of the coast. Hotham ordered Maitland that if he intercepted Bonaparte he should take him to England.<br>
<br>On 10 July negotiations with Maitland were opened on behalf of Bonaparte, who had then reached Rochefort. Maitland rejected the proposal that he should be allowed to sail to the United States, but offered to take him to England. After four anxious days, Bonaparte, with his staff and servants, embarked on the <i>Bellerophon</i> on 15 July. On 24 July the ship reached Torbay; thence she was ordered round to Plymouth to await the decision of the government. She put to sea again on 4 August, and on the 7th, off Berry Head, Bonaparte was removed to the <i>Northumberland</i>. To counteract misrepresentation, Maitland wrote for his friends a detailed <span class="italic">Narrative</span> of Bonaparte's time on the <i>Bellerophon</i>, which he subsequently published in 1826.<br>
<br>In October 1818 Maitland was appointed to the <i>Vengeur</i> (74 guns), in which in 1819 he went out to South America. In 1820 he carried Lord Beresford from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon, and went on to the Mediterranean, where he was sent to Naples to take the king of the Two Sicilies to Leghorn. On landing on 20 December, after a rough passage of seven days, the king invested Maitland with the insignia of a knight commander of the order of St Ferdinand and Merit, and presented him with his portrait, set with diamonds, in a gold box. The <i>Vengeur</i> returned to England in the following spring, and Maitland was appointed to the <i>Genoa</i> (74 guns), guardship at Portsmouth, which he left in October on the completion of his three years' continuous service. From 1827 to 1830 he commanded the <i>Wellesley</i> (74 guns) in the Mediterranean. He attained his flag on 22 July 1830. He had been made a CB in 1815; on 17 November 1830 he was advanced to KCB. From 1832 to 1837 he was admiral superintendent of the dockyard at Portsmouth; in July 1837 he was appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies and China, with his flag in his old ship the <i>Wellesley</i>. In February 1839, when co-operating with the army on its advance from Bombay towards Afghanistan, he captured the town and fort of Karachi, and covered the landing of the troops and stores. Afterwards, on the news of some disturbances at Bushehr, he went there and, under the protection of the marines of the squadron, brought away the resident and his staff without punishing the rioters, conduct which the Anglo-Indian press criticized as injudiciously lenient.<br>
<br>Maitland died at sea, on board the <i>Wellesley</i>, off Bombay, on 30 November 1839. He was buried at Bombay, where, in the cathedral, a monument to his memory was erected by subscription. Lady Maitland died in 1865 at Lindores, Fife.<br>
