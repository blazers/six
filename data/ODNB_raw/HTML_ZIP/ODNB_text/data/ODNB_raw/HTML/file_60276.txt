<span class="headword">Robinson,  (Frances) Mabel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>W. S. Gregg]</span>  (1858&#150;1956), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in Milverton Crescent, Milverton, near Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 16 June 1858, the second daughter of George Thomas Robinson (1828&#150;1897), an architect who specialized in designing the decorative fittings of great steamships, and his wife, Frances Sparrow (1831&#150;1916). She was the younger sister of the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59577/', "(Agnes) Mary Frances Duclaux (1857&#150;1944)")</script>. The girls were both greatly influenced by their father, who let them read freely the books in his well-provided library. Between 1872 and 1873 they attended a finishing school in Brussels, subsequently enrolling among the first women students of the University of London (1875&#150;80). Mabel Robinson later became secretary of Bedford College, London University's principal college for women.<br>
<br>Mabel Robinson and her sister Mary immersed themselves in London's cultural life in the early 1880s, both organizing and attending all sorts of parties. The writer Violet Paget (Vernon Lee) was a frequent house guest at the time, and in her letters to her mother she provided incisive sketches of the celebrities who frequented the Robinsons' house, including John Sargent, Robert Browning, William Morris, and Oscar Wilde. She also depicted both sisters (although with what degree of accuracy is uncertain) in her <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i>, <span class="italic">Miss Brown</span> (1884). Here Mabel's interests were described as &#145;school boards, and depauperisation, and (it must be admitted) a mild flirtation with young men of scientific and humanitarian tendencies&#146;  (Lee, 30). The relationship between Paget and Mabel Robinson was a tense one: eventually the guest left the house with Mary Robinson and a kind of reconciliation some months later did not produce any real harmony.<br>
<br>Paget had, however, correctly differentiated Mabel Robinson's more political interests from her sister's poetic ones. The younger sister quickly developed an interest in the heated debates in the House of Commons over the introduction of home rule in Ireland. She was eventually to engage herself politically to the extent of carrying secret messages back and forth between England and Ireland.<br>
<br>In a short autobiographical sketch of her own literary development, Mabel Robinson observed that the idea of writing books occurred to her only after she had devoted most of her girlhood to painting. As a result, she believed, her work was less methodical than it would have been had she started to write earlier. In the same essay she admitted that her style was not always as she wished it to be, but she held that content was more important: &#145;human feeling&#146;, she wrote, &#145;is for ever interesting&#146;, dismissing style as, to a great extent, a thing of fashion  (Bainton, 326&#150;8).<br>
<br>Robinson published a series of novels in the 1880s and 1890s. In tales such as <span class="italic">Mr Butler's Ward</span> (1885), <span class="italic">Disenchantment</span> (1886), <span class="italic">The Plan of Campaign: a Story of the Fortune of War</span> (1888), <span class="italic">A Woman of the World: an Everyday Story</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">Chimaera</span> (1895) she seems to follow the naturalistic tradition, presenting grim pictures of Irish characters who are bogged down by their fate. Although generally endorsing the Victorian moral order regarding woman's position within marriage and the family, Robinson succeeded in introducing some subversive comments on women's social position in her novels. In <span class="italic">A Woman of the World</span>, for instance, her young female protagonist argues that beautiful girls may dress attractively for their own pleasure and not necessarily to seduce potential suitors: &#145;it's an insult to all womanhood to suppose that when a girl wears a string of beads she&#151;she&#151;&#146;  (F. M. Robinson, <span class="italic">A Woman of the World</span>, 1890, 1.90). She also repudiated the attitude which forbade women to earn their own living. It is one of her unsympathetic male characters who endorsed that reactionary viewpoint: &#145;That a woman should earn her bread, Will, makes me sick!&#146;  (ibid., 1.232). Like her sister, Mabel Robinson contributed many reviews to the weekly <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in the late 1880s and 1890s; she concentrated on Irish publications, whether historical, political, or fictional. But she also indulged her interest in art by writing articles on Italian art for <span class="italic">Atalanta</span> and the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>.<br>
<br>After the death of George Robinson in 1897, Mrs Frances Robinson went to live in Paris, in the place des Pyramides. Mabel Robinson joined her there, and a few years later moved to an apartment building in which her widowed sister also lived. The two sisters exchanged Paris for Aurillac during the Second World War. Mabel Robinson died in 1956 in Paris.<br>
