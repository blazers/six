<span class="headword">Slater,  Eliot Trevor Oakeshott</span>  (1904&#150;1983), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39443/', "Gilbert Slater (1864&#150;1938)")</script>, economic historian and principal of Ruskin College, Oxford, and Violet Oakeshott, was born on 28 August 1904 at 84 Eglinton Road, Plumstead, London. His mother being a Quaker he went to Leighton Park School, Reading, from where he won an exhibition to St John's College, Cambridge, to study natural sciences. From 1925 he continued his medical education at St George's Hospital, London, qualifying as a doctor in 1928. He then spent two years in medical posts in general practice, at St George's, and at the West End Hospital for Nervous Diseases, passing the membership examination of the Royal College of Physicians in 1930. In his &#145;Autobiographical sketch&#146; (1971) he described his next post, assistant medical officer at Derby County Mental Hospital, as stultifying and was therefore overjoyed to be appointed medical officer at the Maudsley Hospital, London (1931), where, with the encouragement of Aubrey Lewis and Edward Mapother, and the assistance of R. A. Fisher, he developed his interest in the application of statistical methods to the empirical study of mental illness.<br>
<br>In 1934 Slater went to the Research Institute for Psychiatry in Munich, studying psychiatric genetics under Bruno Schulz. He met and, on 24 December 1935, married his first wife, Lydia Pasternak [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61716/', "Slater, Lydia Elisabeth Leonidovna Pasternak (1902&#150;1989)")</script>], a research chemist in the institute in Munich. She was daughter of Leonid Pasternak, and sister of the poet and novelist Boris Pasternak. Their four children (two daughters and two sons) became respectively an English don, a psychiatrist, a mathematician, and a haematologist.<br>
<br>Slater returned to the Maudsley in 1935, continuing his research on the inheritance of mental disorders, but when war broke out in 1939 psychiatric services at the Maudsley were dispersed and he became clinical director of the Sutton Emergency Hospital, where he was responsible for the treatment of some twenty thousand psychiatric casualties. This experience led to the influential book <span class="italic">Physical Methods of Treatment in Psychiatry</span> (with William Sargant, 1944). From 1946 he was physician in psychological medicine at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, London, but he resigned in 1964 in protest at the hospital's rejection of the offer of a benefaction to establish a chair in psychiatry there. After the dissolution of his marriage he married, in 1946, Jean Fyfe Foster.<br>
<br>As senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry (1950&#150;59) Slater continued to work, notably on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in twins, assisted by James Shields. In 1959 Slater formed the Medical Research Council Psychiatric Genetics Unit at the Maudsley, which he directed until 1969. This work culminated in <span class="italic">The Genetics of Mental Disorders</span> (with Valerie Cowie, 1971).<br>
<br>Slater published about 150 books and papers, of which <span class="italic">Clinical Psychiatry</span> (with Willi Mayer-Gross and Martin Roth, 1954) was long the leading textbook of psychiatry in English. He gave the Litchfield (1959), Galton (1960), and Mapother (1960) lectures, and in the Maudsley lecture (1961) and elsewhere attacked the concept of hysteria as a valid syndrome: in an influential follow-up study of patients diagnosed as suffering from hysteria he showed that serious underlying physical illness emerged later in many of them and that this could in itself account for their allegedly psychological symptoms. As editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Psychiatry</span> from 1961 to 1972 Slater transformed it into a leading European journal. Colleagues noted the hard work and willingness to assist the efforts of others which characterized his editorship. In 1966 he was appointed CBE. He held honorary fellowships of several British and American medical and psychiatric societies, and was fellow and vice-president (1963&#150;6) of the Eugenics Society.<br>
<br>Slater's interests were wide: in 1964 he was a member of the royal commission on capital punishment, and after retirement he joined the Euthanasia Society. He was agnostic, and found himself at times more at home with ideas than with people. He published a statistical investigation of chess openings, pathographic studies of composers, and a book of poetry. An exhibition of his paintings was held in 1977. He remained active long after retirement, being awarded the degree of PhD (London) at the age of seventy-seven for a statistical word study of <span class="italic">Edward III</span> which provided evidence that the play was written by Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Slater died at his home, the Coach House, 128A Castelnau, Barnes, London on 15 May 1983 of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife and the four children of his first marriage. Although his advocacy of the theory that schizophrenia is inherited by a single partially dominant gene was, and remains, controversial, he had achieved international recognition for his work on psychiatric genetics and the nature of neurosis. By his concern for the systematic collection and critical analysis of data he helped to establish psychiatry as a scientific discipline capable of rigorous empirical study.<br>
