<span class="headword">Tennant,  Charles</span>  (1768&#150;1838), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, born on 3 May 1768 at Laigh Corton Farm, near Ayr, Ayrshire, was the sixth of thirteen children of John (&#145;Auld Glen&#146;) Tennant (1726&#150;1810), a farmer, and his second wife, Margaret McClure (1738&#150;1784). The Tennants moved to Ochiltree, and after his education at home and Ochiltree parish school, Charles was apprenticed to a hand-loom weaver at Kilbarchan. After he had studied bleaching methods at Wellmeadow, he started his own bleachfield at Darnley about 1788 with a friend from Paisley. Bleaching then consisted of boiling or &#145;bucking&#146; the cloth in weak alkali and finally &#145;crofting&#146; or exposing it in the open air for some days. This second process was gradually replaced by using chlorine dissolved in water; later dilute potash ley was used in place of the water, the resulting liquid being known as &#145;eau de Javelle&#146;.<br>
<br>On 17 October 1795 Tennant married Margaret Wilson (1765&#150;1843) at Paisley Abbey; there were nine children of this marriage. In 1798 he took out a patent to make strong bleaching solution cheaply by passing chlorine into a well-agitated mixture of lime and water. Certain Lancashire bleachers infringed his patent and Tennant took legal proceedings against them. The proceedings revealed, however, that this method had been in use for some years before the patent had been granted and it was consequently declared void. In 1799 Tennant took out another patent to manufacture bleaching powder by passing chlorine over slaked lime, a process probably largely developed by his partner, Charles Macintosh. He then moved to St Rollox, near Glasgow, where with his partners he established a factory to produce the powder commercially. Soda ash and other alkali products were also made, and St Rollox eventually grew into one of Europe's largest chemical works.<br>
<br>Outside business, Tennant was politically active and a strong supporter of free trade and the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. He managed to improve Glasgow's water supply and also encouraged railway development, becoming chief promoter of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, which opened in 1831. Charles Tennant was a handsome man with a determined mouth and chin, deep-set eyes, and bushy eyebrows. He was hard-working, shrewd, kind, and quiet. Modestly he refused to be considered for a knighthood just a few months before his death from erysipelas at his home, 195 West George Street, Glasgow, on 1 October 1838. He was buried at Glasgow necropolis on 8 October. His estate was valued at more than &pound;94,000.<br>
