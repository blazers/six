<span class="headword">Moraley,  William</span>  (1698&#150;1762), <span class="occ">indentured servant and writer</span>, was born on 25 February 1698 and baptized on 1 March at Christ Church, Greyfriars, Newgate, London, the only child of William Moraley (<i>d</i>. 1725), a journeyman watchmaker, and Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mason (<i>d</i>. 1740), the daughter of a London founder. By Moraley's own account he studied Latin, arithmetic, music, dancing, and natural philosophy as a child. His later writings indicate that he was also well read. Aged fifteen he was bound as clerk to an attorney, but he pursued a life of pleasure rather than studying the law. His father took him on as an apprentice watchmaker in 1718, but theirs was a contentious relationship that was compounded by William senior's loss of &pound;800 following the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720. Three years later the family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. His father died in 1725 and left the bulk of his estate to his wife, with only a few shillings and tools being bequeathed to his son. Moraley subsequently quarrelled with his mother over the inheritance, of which the perceived injustice troubled him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Moraley's spendthrift habits, his estrangement from his family, and the economic downturn of the late 1720s brought imprisonment for debt. He was freed from Newgate prison, Newcastle, following parliament's general amnesty of May 1729 and travelled to London, where officials arrested him almost immediately for stealing food; he was acquitted in July because of lack of evidence. Hungry and with few job prospects, in October 1729 Moraley sold himself as an indentured servant and agreed to serve five years as (in his own words) one of the &#145;Voluntary Slaves&#146; in the &#145;American Plantations&#146;. He sailed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Isaac Pearson, a Quaker clockmaker from Burlington, New Jersey, purchased him for &pound;11. Having run away and been recaptured, Moraley was inexplicably able to negotiate a shorter term of service: three years as a blacksmith, cow tender, general labourer, and watch- and clockmaker. He was freed by early 1733 and then travelled through several colonies, rollicking with friends and eluding his creditors, but also failing to find sufficient work. Moraley was now penniless and, having signed on as a ship's cook, returned to England in late 1734 in the hope of securing a larger portion of his father's estate. He lived in Newcastle with his mother&#151;who remarried twice after 1725&#151;until her death in 1740. His objections to her will, which sought to protect the estate from his wastrel ways, led to heated disputes with her executors. About this time he may have suffered a mental breakdown.<br>
<br>In 1743 Moraley published <span class="italic">The Infortunate, or, The Voyage and Adventures of William Moraley</span>, the work for which he is now remembered. The memoir is an entertaining and informative 64 page account that combines a picaresque autobiography with extended descriptions of the middle American colonies, and three interspersed sensational stories. A final section explains the legal basis for his disputes with his mother's executors. <span class="italic">The Infortunate</span> also provides a rare study of colonial life and thought from the perspective of a down-and-out servant. Moraley's assessment of Pennsylvania as the &#145;best poor Man's Country in the World&#146; has been widely cited by historians as an accurate characterization of British North America. However, many scholars have overlooked Moraley's contention that American servants experienced &#145;very hard&#146; conditions, while those of slaves were &#145;very bad&#146; and transatlantic landowners prospered because they paid no wages to bound workers.<br>
<br>The first edition of <span class="italic">The Infortunate</span> had a small press run and sold few copies. However, it reached a larger audience when an 1884 edition, slightly bowdlerized and omitting the sensational stories, appeared in Britain in the <span class="italic">Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</span> and in the United States in the <span class="italic">Delaware County Republican</span>. An annotated edition was published in 1992 and a second, revised edition in 2005. Representative segments from <span class="italic">The Infortunate</span> are included in many historical and literary anthologies since Moraley offers a unique perspective on the colonies, and because his account provides a balance to the exceptional success story portrayed in Benjamin Franklin's autobiography.<br>
<br>Little is known of Moraley's life following publication of <span class="italic">The Infortunate</span>. He may have married and perhaps had a child, but none of the existing records can be conclusively linked to the author as the name was common in the Newcastle area. Moraley is known to have published two pamphlets in the 1750s, an indication that his financial status may have improved. The first of these, <span class="italic">The Orphan, or, Revived Fugitive: humbly dedicated to the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor of London</span> (1753), has not been located. It most probably rehearsed the argument for overturning his mother's will, since Moraley hoped to bring his case to the equity courts presided over by the lord mayor. In the following year he published, pseudonymously, a 12 page pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Proceedings and Humours of a Late Election in the City of Sandburg &hellip; by Wm. Thompson, Gent.</span>, of which only one copy survives. Moraley's text is an elaborate satire on the parliamentary election of 1754 and indicates that he became increasingly radical from the mid-1740s as Newcastle suffered economic dislocation and violent protests. His satire imagines a world turned upside down in which commoners are elevated, aristocrats ridiculed, and the local government holds contested elections, abolishes monopolies, and protects religious dissenters.<br>
<br>William Moraley was listed as a watchmaker at the time of his death in Newcastle in 1762, and was buried on 19 January 1762 at St Nicholas's Church. He died intestate but in <span class="italic">The Infortunate</span> Moraley left an important literary legacy that reveals the lives of poorer inhabitants of the American colonies, Britain, and the Atlantic world.<br>
