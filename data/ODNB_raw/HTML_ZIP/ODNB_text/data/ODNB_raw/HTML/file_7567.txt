<span class="headword">Devereux,  Walter</span>, first Viscount Hereford  (<em>c.</em>1489&#150;1558), <span class="occ">administrator and nobleman</span>, was the son and heir of John Devereux, second Baron Ferrers of Chartley (<i>c</i>.1463/4&#150;1501), and his wife, Cecily (<i>d</i>. 1493), heir of the houses of Bourchier and de Bohun and niece of Edward IV. Succeeding his father as third Lord Ferrers in 1501, Walter had, while still under age, married Lady Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11560/', "Thomas Grey, first marquess of Dorset")</script> and great-grandfather of Lady Jane Grey. Having been a ward in the royal household, he was summoned to Henry VIII's first parliament in January 1510 and soon afterwards became steward of several royal manors and joint constable of Warwick Castle. In 1512 he joined his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11561/', "Thomas Grey, second marquess of Dorset")</script>, on an Anglo-Spanish expedition intended to recover Aquitaine, and in 1513 was nominated by the king himself to captain the <i>Gryt Herry Imperyall</i>, serving also in that year at the battle of Flodden. When in June 1520 King Henry met Fran&ccedil;ois I of France at the Field of Cloth of Gold and then the recently elected Emperor Charles V at Gravelines, Devereux was present on both occasions. In 1521 he sat with other peers in judgment on Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham, and two years later served again in France, returning there once more for the campaign of 1544 when the king himself took charge.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Devereux became increasingly active in the government of Wales and the Welsh marches, location of much of his landed estate. Already a member of the council originally formed to administer the lands of the prince of Wales and then developed into a vehicle of provincial law enforcement, he was appointed to that body as reconstituted by Wolsey in 1525, holding at the same time the office of steward in the Princess Mary's household at Ludlow. Further appointments to offices of profit rapidly followed, culminating in 1545 in that of chamberlain of the recently established court of general surveyors, and punctuated along the way by more stewardships of crown lordships and manors as well as regular service on administrative and judicial commissions in Wales, the marches, and the west midlands. By comparison, Devereux's gains in terms of land were relatively modest. In 1548 his gross annual income from rents amounted to approximately &pound;870, while his heir eventually took possession of a landed estate valued at a mere &pound;400 per annum.<br>
<br>Even so, in the turbulent politics of the mid-sixteenth century Devereux was manifestly significant. Allied through his first marriage to the family of Grey, he was also linked from 1536 to that of Hastings when his second son, Richard, married Dorothy, daughter of the first earl of Huntingdon. The second earl of Huntingdon and the third marquess of Dorset emerged as prominent supporters of John Dudley, earl of Warwick, when, from October 1549, he carried through his coup against the lord protector, Somerset. In January 1550 Devereux was sworn of the privy council; in February he was created Viscount Hereford. Seasoned in the ways of provincial government, this well-connected marcher lord was a valuable asset in Warwick's stratagems, even though his role in the subsequent progress of the Reformation and other events of Edward VI's reign remains obscure. Briefly imprisoned on Mary Tudor's succession to the throne, he lost not only his place at the centre of affairs, but also many of his offices. Yet, by one of the last grants of her reign, and within two months of the viscount's death, the queen granted stewardships of lands and courts in several shires of Wales to his heir. That heir, again named Walter and again a minor, was the viscount's grandson by his second son, the eldest of his three sons by his first marriage, to Mary Grey, having also predeceased him. Following Mary's death in 1538 Devereux had taken as his second wife Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1599), daughter of John Garneys of Kenton in Suffolk, with whom he had a daughter, Katherine, and a fourth son, Edward, father of the fifth Viscount Hereford. Devereux died on 17 September 1558 at his home, Chartley, Staffordshire, and was buried in Stowe church under a monument.<br>
