<span class="headword">Ewbank,  John Wilson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1799?, <em>d.</em> 1847), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was probably baptized at St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington, co. Durham, on 4 May 1799 and was adopted when a child by a wealthy uncle who lived at nearby Wycliffe, on the banks of the Tees, Yorkshire. It was intended that Ewbank should become a Roman Catholic priest and he was therefore sent to Ushaw College, near Durham. He absconded, however, and became an apprentice to T. Coulson, an ornamental painter in Newcastle. On visiting Edinburgh with his master, Ewbank was encouraged to study under Alexander Nasmyth, and he soon set up in practice as an independent artist and drawing-master. The vigour and accuracy of his sketches from nature were especially admired; a series of fifty-one drawings of Edinburgh, by him, were engraved by W. H. Lizars for Dr James Browne's <span class="italic">Picturesque Views of Edinburgh</span> (1825). Another view of the city, <span class="italic">View of Edinburgh from Inchkeith</span>, was one of his finest landscapes. His reputation, however, was chiefly established by his small-scale marine paintings, which reflected the influence of Dutch seventeenth-century artists, such as Willem Van de Velde, and he was considered one of the foremost marine artists of this period. During the late 1820s he turned to subject matter of a more ambitions character, painting <span class="italic">The Visit of George IV to Edinburgh</span>, <span class="italic">The Entry of Alexander the Great into Babylon</span> (exh. RA, 1826), and <span class="italic">Hannibal Crossing the Alps</span> at the apogee of his career. His annual income at this point was said to be no less than &pound;2500, and in 1826 he was nominated a founder member of the Royal Scottish Academy. He exhibited numerous paintings at the academy between 1827 and 1833 as well as twenty-seven works (mostly shipping and coastal views) at the Carlisle Academy between 1825 and 1833.<br>
<br>At a late stage in his career, however, Ewbank became an alcoholic and he descended into extreme poverty. In a letter of 27 December 1829 he wrote of having &#145;made a sacrifice of part of my Pictures&#146;, but of still facing imprisonment for debt  (NL Scot., MS 1831, fol. 178). His pictures were frequently painted in the bar of a public house or in his own squalid home. According to one obituarist:<blockquote>a solitary chair and a pile or two of bricks formed the only articles in the shape of furniture to be seen&#151;the window-sill serving for his easel &hellip; [the pictures] were generally painted on tin, within an hour or two, and sold on the instant, wet and unvarnished, for sixpence or a shilling, which was immediately spent in ministering to his sensual gratifications. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, new ser., 29, 1848, 668)</blockquote>According to his death certificate Ewbank died, aged forty-seven, of typhus fever on 28 November 1847 in the workhouse infirmary at Bishop Wearmouth, Sunderland (not at Edinburgh as stated in his <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary). His letters refer to his &#145;family&#146;, with whom, according to the 1841 census, he was living at Oakwellgate, a very poor part of Gateshead; the census return indicates that he was married to Mary Ewbank, with whom he had three daughters and a son, the eldest daughter then being fifteen. Examples of his work are in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh; the Shipley Art Gallery, Gateshead; the British Museum, London; the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle; the Sutherland Art Gallery; and Tyneside Public Libraries.<br>
