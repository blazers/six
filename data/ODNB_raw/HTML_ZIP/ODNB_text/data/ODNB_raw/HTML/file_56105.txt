<span class="headword">Saurin,  Susan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Scholastica]</span>  (1829&#150;1915), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born on 21 September 1829 at Garballagh House, Duleek, co. Meath, Ireland, the youngest of six children of Michael Saurin, landowner, and his wife, Brigid, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mathews. Two sisters were Carmelite nuns, one brother, Matthew, was a Jesuit priest, and another, Patrick, was a lawyer. Her brother Michael died in 1863.<br>
<br>Susan entered Baggot Street Convent of Mercy, Dublin, in November 1850. Under the name Sister Scholastica, she became a fully professed nun on 3 October 1853, taking vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. She was selected to join the founding nuns of a new Mercy convent first at Clifford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (1856), and subsequently in Hull. Her superior in Clifford and Hull was Mother Mary Starr (Sister Joseph), whose mother assistant (deputy) was Mother Julia Kennedy (Sister Magdalen). All three nuns had trained together in Baggot Street.<br>
<br>Under Starr's direction Saurin undertook a variety of menial duties in the convent, but in every task she seemed to incur the displeasure of her inexperienced superior, who excelled at highlighting Saurin's faults. Starr's displeasure reached its zenith when Saurin refused to disclose to her the substance of her conversation with a priest in confession and when Saurin wrote to her uncle, a priest in Drogheda, asking him to arrange a transfer for her to another convent in Ireland. These were deemed to be sins of disobedience and of the writing of clandestine letters. Bishop Robert Cornthwaite of Beverley (the local ordinary) received two requests to intervene. Starr insisted that he help her to get rid of Saurin by dispensing her from her vows. The Saurin family, on the other hand, insisted that he investigate the convent because of the ill treatment being meted out to Susan.<br>
<br>A commission of inquiry was appointed, with a panel of five priest commissioners. Saurin was the only nun to be interviewed and cross-examined on twelve charges of faults against obedience, poverty, charity, and truth. The panel reported unanimously to the bishop against Saurin, although in their individual reports on the inquiry four of the panel had highlighted mitigating circumstances in Saurin's favour, including &#145;unrefuted testimony to several instances of extraordinary and unexemplary severity&#146;  (Leeds Diocesan Archives, <i>Saurin v. Starr</i> MSS). Saurin was required to leave the convent. Her family was furious and vowed to seek justice in the courts. Saurin refused to leave the convent and to acknowledge the bishop's power to dispense with her vows without her consent. Starr and Kennedy ignored her views. Deeming her to be no longer a member of the community, they confined her to an attic room with many privations. She remained there for more than thirteen months until she almost starved to death. In May 1867, on the advice of her brother Patrick and a Hull physician, she left the convent quietly, unknown to Starr and Kennedy.<br>
<br>The next time they met was on 3 February 1869 at Westminster Hall, London, to answer the case of <i>Saurin v. Starr and another</i> before the lord chief justice and the court of the queen's bench. The case lasted a record twenty-one days and made significant history as &#145;The Great Convent Case&#146;. Nuns, priests, parents, schoolchildren, the physician, and Bishop Cornthwaite were all called to give evidence. Starr and Kennedy were found guilty of wrongfully and maliciously compelling Saurin to leave the convent and of subjecting her to various indignities, assaults, persecutions, and annoyances, including trying to libel her before the bishop. The trial was given extensive media coverage and caricatures of the key figures occupied pages in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> and <span class="italic">Punch</span>. The solicitor-general described the case as a scandalous affair in which no scandal had been discovered. The legal costs to the Hull nuns came to &pound;6000.<br>
<br>Details of Saurin's subsequent life as recorded in the Mercy annals are scant and misleading. Five years after the case, under the assumed name of Mary Brown, she entered the Visitation Convent at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol. As Sister Michael she remained incognito for many years, and died in the Visitation Convent at Harrow on the Hill on 10 February 1915, aged eighty-five years. She was buried first at the Visitation Convent and then reinterred at Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
