<span class="headword">Manning,  Frederic</span>  (1882&#150;1935), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 22 July 1882 at 29 Upper William Street South, Sydney, Australia, the sixth of the eight children of Sir William Patrick Manning (1845&#150;1915), accountant and local politician, and his wife, Honora (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Torpy). Sir William, whose parents and wife were Irish Roman Catholic immigrants, was a respected and powerful figure in Sydney, knighted in 1894. Frederic was a lifelong asthmatic, and so was educated almost entirely at home. In his early teens he formed a close intellectual friendship with Arthur Galton (1852&#150;1921), a scholarly Englishman who had moved to Sydney as secretary to the governor. Manning accompanied Galton to England in 1898, and returned to Australia in 1900, but settled in England for good in 1903, taking lodgings with Galton, who was by then vicar of Edenham, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Sensitive and unassertive, Manning seems to have been dominated by the increasingly ill-tempered, reactionary vicar, who hoped he would write a masterpiece. Manning laboured in vain on a historical novel, and read widely in the classics and philosophy, enjoying the great sceptics and sharing Galton's scorn for Roman Catholicism (although he never quite deserted the faith). He was of slight build, his drawn face and large dark eyes showing the constant strain of asthma, made worse by heavy smoking. Lonely and often unwell, he developed a weakness for alcohol. He probably never had a sexual relationship; Galton and several motherly women were perhaps parent-substitutes. He made several London friends: Max Beerbohm, William Rothenstein, and others, and two young modernists, Ezra Pound and Richard Aldington. Pound said later that &#145;Fred&#146;, whom he always highly esteemed, had been his first literary companion in England.<br>
<br>Manning's first two books, <span class="italic">The Vigil of Brunhild</span> (1907), a verse monologue, and <span class="italic">Scenes and Portraits</span> (1909), were well received by a small, discriminating readership. <span class="italic">Scenes and Portraits</span> is a collection of debates&#151;ironic, elegant, inconclusive&#151;about religion in different periods of society. Manning began to be talked of as an outstanding new talent, although his <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1910) showed little originality.<br>
<br>It may seem extraordinary that such a man was keen to join the army when war came. Perhaps Manning was driven by Galton's loathing of Germany, or perhaps by the chance of freedom from the vicarage. After various attempts, he was accepted as Private 19022 in the King's Shropshire light infantry in October 1915. He coped well with life in the ranks, observing his fellow soldiers with an Australian's lack of class-consciousness and warmly admiring their spirit. After failing an officer training course, he was sent to France for the second half of 1916, took part in the Somme fighting, and was promoted lance-corporal. He came home in December for further training, and in May 1917 was posted to Ireland as second lieutenant, Royal Irish regiment. Loathing the ethos of an officers' mess, he was soon in trouble, receiving a severe reprimand in August for excessive drinking; neurasthenia was diagnosed, perhaps generously. His resignation was accepted in February 1918.<br>
<br>Manning had published a collection of verse, <span class="italic">Eidola</span>, in 1917. The style was still predominantly old-fashioned, but the war poems showed traces of Pound's imagism. Their central theme is the complete self-possession that can be found in battle, where each individual finds secret freedom, fighting for his own dreams.<br>
<br>Needing to supplement the small income he received from his family, Manning accepted a commission to write <span class="italic">The Life of Sir William White</span> (1923), a meticulous, uninspired biography of the ship designer. He ceased to have a settled home after Galton's death in 1921, except for a brief period when he owned a Surrey farmhouse. He wrote for periodicals, including T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Criterion</span>, but without a mentor he seemed likely to drift, until in 1929 the publisher Peter Davies persuaded him to write a short novel about the western front. The market for war books was suddenly opening up; urged on by Davies, who allowed no opportunity for revisions, Manning worked fast. Unlike most other authors of the time, he wrote about the troops, using their normal language.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Middle Parts of Fortune</span> appeared anonymously in a small, private edition in 1929 (the standard text since republication in 1977). The expurgated version, <span class="italic">Her Privates We</span>, by Private 19022, was published by Davies in 1930. Though unobtrusively literary&#151;Manning's friend, T. E. Lawrence, claimed to have seen that it had to be by the same author as <span class="italic">Scenes and Portraits</span>&#151;the book is a vivid story of archetypal soldiers, their innate strengths brought out by suffering and comradeship. <span class="italic">The Middle Parts of Fortune</span> is one of the finest accounts of war ever written, as many of its early readers recognized. Manning used his own experiences, and the central character Bourne, a mysterious, detached figure, is his self-portrait. Bourne, however, dies at the end of 1916, and the survivors are left immersed in their own thoughts, &#145;each man keeping his own secret&#146;.<br>
<br>Manning kept his own secret. Comparatively little is recorded about him. The authorship of his one great book was not widely known, and he was never famous. He died of pneumonia and asthma at a Hampstead nursing home at 12 Merton Road on 22 February 1935, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 26 February.<br>
