<span class="headword">Seward,  William</span>  (1711&#150;1740), <span class="occ">promoter of Methodism and friend of George Whitefield</span>, was born into a family of independent landed means at Badsey, a hamlet near Evesham, Worcestershire. Of his brothers, Thomas became a clergyman of the Church of England, and was in Genoa when William accompanied the Calvinistic Methodist leader George Whitefield to Georgia; a second brother, Henry, married a Baptist and became a strong opponent of Methodism; a third, Benjamin, enjoyed a Cambridge education, was converted by William in 1739, and occasionally wrote hymns. William himself succeeded in business as a stockbroker sufficiently well to enable him to devote himself to the evangelical movement to which he was exposed through active work for the London charity schools in the late 1720s, raising an income of &pound;150 per annum for the Hackney school despite opposition from the parish's minister, churchwardens and vestrymen. Whitefield told Seward later that his &#145;nine years round of duties were no effects of the new birth at all&#146;, being merely &#145;<i>preparation</i> for conversion itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of George Whitefield</span>, 180); Charles Wesley also took a modest view of his spiritual maturity, assessing him on 13 November 1738 as a &#145;zealous soul knowing only the baptism of John&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Rev. Charles Wesley</span>, 1.135). A week later, however, he noted that &#145;Mr Seward testified faith&#146;, and in January 1739 was present at a conference of Oxford Methodists.<br>
<br>Seward now began to travel with Whitefield, and joined him on his first and most triumphant American tour, in August 1739. There he acted as Whitefield's publicist, providing newspapers and booksellers with extracts of Whitefield's own writing as well as a series of partly fabricated stories which, blurring the boundary between news reporting and advertisement, did much to enhance the apparent impact of the tour. Not least he also supported Whitefield generously from his own pocket, a liberality which incensed his brother Henry. The latter now &#145;fell upon&#146; Charles Wesley with accusations:<blockquote>I was the downfall of his brother, had picked his pocket, ruined his family, come now to get more money, was a scoundrel, rascal and so forth and deserved to have my gown stripped over my ears. He concluded with threatening how he would beat me, if he could but catch me on Bengeworth Common. (<span class="italic">Journal of the Rev. Charles Wesley</span>, 15 March 1740, 1.195)</blockquote>And he did in fact have him forcibly removed from the neighbourhood.Three months later William, who had given Whitefield valuable service in America by securing the advance contacts he needed to make his tours a success, was back in England on Whitefield's instructions, partly to mend family relations but still more to further urgent Georgia business. He was to bring out John Hutchings, one of the Oxford Methodists, to manage Whitefield's orphan house in Georgia; to persuade the Georgia trustees that their colony would not succeed without negro slavery, allowing a title to lands there and an independent magistracy; to collect money for a negro school in Pennsylvania; and to bring over money already in the hands of trustees for building a church at Savannah. Seward had already bought Whitefield 5000 acres on the forks of the Delaware to establish an evangelical refuge in the style of Herrnhut, and a negro school. Moreover Seward was a widower, and he wished to remove his daughter's education from a governess, and complete it at the orphan house. His arrival increased the theological tension between Whitefield and the Wesley brothers, who did not care for Seward's <span class="italic">Journal of a Voyage from Savannah &hellip; to England</span>, published in 1740. Falling under Baptist influence, Seward now quarrelled bitterly with Charles Wesley. These disputes were, however, overshadowed by Seward's sad fate. While accompanying Howell Harris on Whitefield's begging mission in south Wales, he lost his sight in a fracas at Caerleon and then, on 22 October 1740, died suddenly, perhaps as a result of a stone being thrown at his head while he was preaching, and traditionally at Hay-on-Wye, Brecknockshire. The earliest reference to the injury describes Seward being attacked in Gloucestershire, and it is possible that Seward's death at or near Hay was the result of the assault at Caerleon. Whatever the cause of his death, Charles Wesley was shocked by it. Seward was buried in the churchyard at St Mary, Cusop, Herefordshire, near Hay. The Seward family disappeared from evangelical history.<br>
