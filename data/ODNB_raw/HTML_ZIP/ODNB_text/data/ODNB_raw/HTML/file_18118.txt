<span class="headword">Marshal,  Andrew</span>  (1742&#150;1813), <span class="occ">physician and anatomist</span>, born at Park Hill, Fife, was the son of John Marshal, a farmer with a numerous family living near Newburgh. He lived for some time with his maternal grandfather who taught him to read before he attended first Mr Taylor's school at Newburgh, in 1750, and then Abernethy School in 1752. At first he intended to become a farmer, but when he was about sixteen he decided to become a minister among the Seceders, a body to which his father belonged, and which had separated from the established kirk in 1732. With a view to accomplishing this Marshal studied Latin and logic. He also published an essay on ambition, and one on composition in the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span>. Unfortunately for Marshal the latter article offended members of his sect and he was excommunicated. For some time subsequently he led a desultory life, without any stable employment. He was for four years tutor in a family on Islay, &#145;striving to instruct unmanageable children&#146;  (Marshal, vi). He then carried on his studies both at Edinburgh and Glasgow while supporting himself by teaching private pupils, and in 1774 travelled abroad for about a year with Lord Balgonie, the eldest son of the earl of Leven and Melville. He translated from the Latin the first three books of Robert Simson's <span class="italic">Elements of the Conic Sections</span> (1775), and gave some attention to Greek, Latin, trigonometry, logic, metaphysics, and theology. At last, when thirty-five years old, he decided to concentrate on medicine, and in 1777 went to London to continue his studies, although he was invited to become a candidate for the professorship of logic and rhetoric at the University of St Andrews.<br>
<br>In London, Marshal attended the lectures of William Cruikshank and of John and William Hunter in Windmill Street. In 1778 he was, through the interest of Lord Leven, appointed surgeon to the 83rd or Glasgow regiment, which he accompanied to Jersey. Here he remained until 1783, when the regiment was disbanded. He performed his duties with great zeal and ability, and with a rigid probity that occasionally involved him in disputes with his commanding officers. In 1782 he graduated MD at Edinburgh, with an inaugural dissertation, <span class="italic">De militum salute tuend&acirc;</span>. In the next year he settled in London, on the suggestion and with the support of David Pitcairn, who was at that time physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He at first intended to practise surgery, and was admitted to the Company of Surgeons in January 1784; but he afterwards became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (September 1788).<br>
<br>For the first seventeen or eighteen years of Marshal's life in London he was known almost exclusively as a successful teacher of anatomy. His anatomical school was in Thavies Inn, Holborn, where he settled in 1785, and built a dissecting room. It was at first intended that the lectures should form part of a scheme (suggested by Pitcairn) for establishing a kind of school of physic and surgery for the pupils of St Bartholomew's Hospital, but this plan, to Marshal's disappointment, did not materialize and led to a cooling in his friendship with Pitcairn. Marshal then lectured on his own account. Both his appearance and his voice were against him, but he was knowledgeable of his subject and the content of his lectures was excellent, and &#145;the whole was given with a constant reference to the infinite wisdom of the contrivance exhibited in the structure, so as to form the finest system of natural theology&#146;. In April 1786 Marshal quarrelled with John Hunter about a paper of Marshal's on hydrophobia. This dispirited Marshal to such an extent that he published nothing more.<br>
<br>In 1800 Marshal gave up his lectures on account of his health, and devoted himself entirely to medical practice, which he had before neglected. He died, after a painful illness, at his home at Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, on 4 April 1813. He was unmarried. He was always of an unsocial temperament, and in his later years was very much alone. He left behind him numerous papers and memorandum books which were entrusted to the care of Solomon Sawrey, who had been his assistant in preparing his lectures. He had also a valuable anatomical museum, of which a detailed catalogue raisonn&eacute; was being prepared at the time of his death. The only papers that were found to be fit for publication were edited by Sawrey with the title, <span class="italic">The morbid anatomy of the brain, in mania and hydrophobia; with the pathology of these two diseases</span> (1815).<br>
