<span class="headword">Hanratty,  James Francis</span>  (1936&#150;1962), <span class="occ">petty criminal and convicted murderer</span>, was born on 4 October 1936 in the County Hospital, Farnborough, near Orpington, Kent, the eldest of four sons of James Hanratty (1907&#150;1978), labourer and dustman, and his wife, Mary Wilson.<br>
<br>He attended St James's Roman Catholic school in Burnt Oak (1945&#150;51) but remained illiterate. In the absence of steady or gainful employment James Hanratty spent most of his adolescent and young adult life engaged in crime&#151;indeed, his last seven years were spent in penal institutions. In September 1954 he was put on probation for a year for taking and driving away a motor car without consent and while uninsured. Hardly had he finished his period on probation than he was before the courts and imprisoned for housebreaking and theft (1955). On this occasion he attempted suicide while in custody. Another prison sentence followed in 1957 in consequence of stealing another car. Almost immediately on release from prison he was reconvicted, in March 1958, to three years' corrective training; he left Strangeways prison, Manchester, on 24 March 1961. Overall Hanratty spent 58 of the 66 months after his nineteenth birthday in prison. Up to this time Hanratty had displayed himself as little more than a small-time hoodlum, always aspiring, ambitiously, to greater notoriety.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1961, however, Michael Gregsten and Valerie Storie were abducted from a Morris Minor car parked in a cornfield at Dorney Reach, Buckinghamshire. Their abductor subsequently shot Gregsten dead and raped and gravely wounded Storie at Deadman's Hill, Bedfordshire. Hanratty was charged with the murder on 14 October 1961.<br>
<br>Hanratty's trial (22 January&#150;17 February 1962) was of unprecedented length for a murder trial against one defendant. It was notable for its conspicuous fairness. The trial judge, Mr Justice Gorman, even refused to allow the crown to adduce fresh evidence about some missing black nylon gloves at a boarding-house where Hanratty had contemporaneously lodged. (Valerie Storie had given firm evidence of the assailant's wearing such gloves&#151;a telling pointer to identification.) The jury's verdict, delayed by a further direction on the meaning of &#145;reasonable doubt&#146;, was surprisingly against Hanratty. Junior counsel for the crown, Geoffrey Lane (later lord chief justice of England), had his pen poised to endorse his brief with the words &#145;not guilty&#146;. The campaign against the verdict was launched, with some justifiable optimism. Its supporters were convinced that they had established an alibi for Hanratty, and attached great importance to the confession to the Deadman's Hill killing by Peter Louis Alphon. A leading legal magazine in an editorial argued that sustaining James Hanratty's conviction in order to avoid embarrassment was carrying factional solidarity to unacceptable extremes. That comment followed an independent inquiry in 1975, conducted in private and largely on the documentation, by Lewis Hawser QC, a much respected practitioner and later an official referee in the High Court. His conclusion was that the case remained overwhelming, and that there was little reason to doubt the jury's verdict. Dispirited, but not dissuaded, the campaigners renewed their efforts to upset the verdict.<br>
<br>On 4 April 1962 Hanratty was executed at Bedford prison, in the precincts of which, on the same day, he was buried initially. He was reinterred at Carpenders Park, Watford, Hertfordshire, on 22 February 1966.<br>
<br>Attempts to declare Hanratty innocent of the crime focused mainly on two aspects of the forensic process: the paucity of direct evidence of complicity and the functioning of an alibi. The identification of Hanratty by the murdered victim's companion, Valerie Storie, was always imperfect, even by the less stringent tests of those days. Hanratty's defence that on the day of the crime he was a couple of hundred miles away, in the north-west of the country, was hotly contested. At the time there was no legal requirement on the defence, pre-trial, to notify the prosecution of an alibi, but, problematically, defence counsel at the committal proceedings before the magistrates at Bedford disclosed his client's case pre-emptively. The jury at Bedford assizes must have been influenced by the prosecution's previous ability to break the alibi. The lack of any scientific evidence proved unavailing.<br>
<br>Of all the perceived miscarriages of justice since the Second World War which scarred the face of English criminal justice, the case of James Hanratty was undoubtedly one of the few most enduring: the campaigners for quashing the 1962 conviction ceaselessly maintained a campaign of literary and other verbal output until the Court of Appeal (criminal division) pronounced finality of the judicial process in late 2001 on a referral under the <span class="roman">Criminal Appeal Act</span> 1995. The Court of Appeal's final verdict (the title of the most substantial study of the case by Bob Woffinden in 1997) was that the 1962 criminal investigation and trial were unsafe, but that the facts ultimately revealed that Hanratty was far from innocent of the crime. Unfortunately, this disconcerted a bewildered public about the &#145;wrongful conviction&#146;. The application of a DNA test on Hanratty's exhumed body in March 2001, on order of the lord chief justice, helped to bolster the soundness of the original guilty verdict, but other aspects of that trial meant that the verdict was nevertheless unsatisfactory, and dictated a quashing of the conviction.<br>
<br>Hanratty's case epitomized the perennial problem of whether the quashing of a conviction was sufficient to demonstrate the individual's innocence of the crime. The public became alive to the fact that the presumption of innocence (original or revived on a successful appeal) is merely a rule of evidence and not a declaration of non-complicity in crime. As the first commentator on the Hanratty case wrote in 1963: &#145;Research into the causes of crime&#151;it seems a blindingly obvious statement&#151;should find its most fruitful material from the administration of criminal justice. Sad to relate, in England, it finds little or no assistance from the legal process&#146;  (Blom-Cooper, 133). Broadly speaking, that remains true today.<br>
