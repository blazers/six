<span class="headword">Erskine,  Stuart Richard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Ruaraidh Erskine of Mar]</span>  (1869&#150;1960), <span class="occ">political activist and Gaelic entrepreneur</span>, was born at 1 Portland Place, Brighton, on 15 January 1869, second of the three sons of William Macnaghten Erskine, fifth Baron Erskine (1841&#150;1913), army officer, and his wife, Caroline Alice Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grimble (<i>d</i>. 1922). He spent his early years in Edinburgh, and lived for prolonged periods in Scotland, England, and France. On 18 July 1891 he married Muriel Lilias Colquhoun, daughter of Major-General G. Irving Graham; she died in 1895, the year after the death of their only child, a daughter. On 6 August 1902 he married Maria Guadelupe Zaara Cecilia Heaven y Ramirez de Arellano (<i>d</i>. 1956), only daughter of Joseph Robert Heaven of the Forest of Birse, and his wife, the marquesa de Braceras.<br>
<br>Erskine learned Gaelic from a childhood nurse who came from the island of Harris, and this kindled the enthusiasm which was to be a main hallmark of his career. His imagination was fired early by the Irish nationalist movement and these combined influences, together with his family's historic Scottish roots, led to his development as a prominent Gaelic nationalist, whose compelling dream was of a self-governing Celtic Scotland. As essential steps towards the realization of this dream he was actively involved in the fostering of Gaelic consciousness and in the extension of Gaelic usage, especially in the written form. He hoped that a significant extension of Gaelic literary range would contribute to the raising of literary standards, in a reaction against what he saw as the down-grading influence of music-hall and &#145;pop&#146; culture on Gaelic verse in the second half of the nineteenth century. He probably also viewed his activity as a response to the dominance of folk culture in the Gaelic literary world.<br>
<br>Erskine's literary programme spanned the first three decades of the twentieth century, the first twenty years being especially prolific. His programme was based on the founding and financial support of a series of Gaelic newspapers and periodicals. The first of these was <span class="italic">Am B&agrave;rd</span> (&#145;The poet&#146;), a bilingual monthly issued in 1901&#150;2. A short-lived weekly Gaelic newspaper, <span class="italic">Alba</span> (&#145;Scotland&#146;), was published in 1908&#150;9, and a publication devoted to fiction, <span class="italic">An Sgeulaiche</span> (&#145;The storyteller&#146;), ran as a monthly from 1909 to 1910 and as a quarterly until 1911. A short series of quite bulky annual volumes, <span class="italic">An R&ograve;sarnach</span> (&#145;The rose garden&#146;), appeared in 1917, 1918, 1921, and 1930. His most substantial and lasting periodical, however, was <span class="italic">Guth na Bliadhna</span> (&#145;The year's voice&#146;), a quarterly which ran from 1904 to 1925, in bilingual format until 1919 and all-Gaelic thereafter. <span class="italic">Guth na Bliadhna</span> marked a clear move towards journalistic and modern writing in Gaelic. One of the most prominent contributors was the journalist Angus Henderson, who often chose topics such as the <span class="roman">Land Act</span>, land and taxes, schools and education, and deer and deer-forests. The didactic drive behind these articles is clear, but Henderson usually produced a well-balanced discussion and verdict. Donald Sinclair, from Barra, contributed poetry and drama, and a new generation of writers appeared late in the series, with Hector MacDougall and John N. MacLeod, both of whom were to be prolific Gaelic writers for the next three or four decades. The political drive behind the publication was sustained throughout its life, with a movement towards the left (and a hint of communism) appearing in the late war and post-war years. Interviewed in 1956, Erskine at the age of eighty-seven was still a convinced nationalist and talked optimistically of returning to Scotland after his years in France and London. However, it was in England that he died, at St Augustine's Hospital, Chartham, Bridge, Kent, on 5 January 1960.<br>
<br>Erskine himself published a number of books, including fiction, history, an edition of Bolingbroke's political writings (1897) and of <span class="italic">The Earl of Mar's Legacies to Scotland</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Bordology: the Science of Determining Character by what a Man Eats and Drinks</span> (1925), and a translation from the Gaelic <span class="italic">The Old Tribute and other Pieces</span> (1929). Although Ruaraidh Erskine's Gaelic publishing work was not very successful in a commercial sense, it had a positive influence on Gaelic writers, and helped to lay the foundations for the resurgence in Gaelic writing (in fiction, poetry, and journalism) which was to come when he had retired from active work in this field.<br>
