<span class="headword">Atkinson,  William</span>  (1758&#150;1846), <span class="occ">pamphleteer and poet</span>, was born on 14 April 1758, at Thorp Arch, West Riding of Yorkshire, and baptized there on 19 May 1758, the fourth and youngest son of the Revd Christopher Atkinson (<i>b</i>. 1712/13), rector of Thorp Arch and formerly master of Macclesfield grammar school, and his wife, Jane, daughter of William Johnson of Old Hall, near Kendal, Westmorland. One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/851/', "Miles Atkinson (1741&#150;1811)")</script>. William Atkinson was admitted a sizar of Jesus College, Cambridge, on 29 December 1775, graduated BA in 1780, and was elected a fellow of his college in 1782, proceeding MA in 1783. He was ordained priest in 1782, and in 1784 was appointed lecturer at the parish church of Bradford, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In the perhaps extravagant words of one late nineteenth-century commentator, this appointment was to cause &#145;one of the most violent controversies Bradford has ever known&#146;  (Scruton, 13). The then master of Bradford grammar school, Edward Baldwyn, had expected the lectureship to fall to him as a matter of custom, and was extremely angry when it was awarded to an outsider instead. Added to this perceived insult was the fact that Atkinson's views were very different from his own, and a bitter war of words ensued. This began with Baldwyn's criticism of Atkinson's <span class="italic">Poetical Essays</span>, published in Leeds in 1786. The volume contained two tales of the inception and frustration of the passion of a young swain and his lover in what Atkinson hoped was an authentic rustic setting, but without what he termed the &#145;vulgarity&#146; of many contemporary pastorals. He seems to have failed on both counts, as his highly stylized poems clearly do not paint a genuine picture of rural life. Baldwyn, however, chose different grounds for his venomous attacks on Atkinson in two satirical pamphlets published under the pseudonym Trim: <span class="italic">A Critique on the Poetical Essays of the Rev. William Atkinson</span> (1787), and <span class="italic">A Congratulatory Letter to the Rev. William Atkinson</span> (1790). In these he maintained that, although not actually indecent, Atkinson's work was well calculated to encourage licentiousness among young readers. Although the poetry itself was also lambasted, Trim concentrated mostly on what he took to be Atkinson's hypocrisy and conservative tendencies, apparently based on sermons preached by Atkinson in Bradford condemning card-playing and dancing. Atkinson, however, was not defenceless against such attacks; he kept a printing press in his home and often issued pamphlets of his own on ecclesiastical and political topics under the name of the Old Inquirer. Between 1794 and 1829 he published a further twenty-five pamphlets, all of which took an increasingly reactionary approach to a variety of political, religious, and economic subjects. A consistent target was dissent; at one time he brought out a small serial called <span class="italic">The Looking Glass</span>, in which he bitterly expressed his views on this topic. He engaged in a short pamphlet war with &#145;Vindex&#146; (Edward Parsons) on the loyalty of dissenters.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1791 Atkinson married Mary, the daughter of John Cottam, and as a result resigned his long-standing college fellowship. He and his wife had three daughters and five sons, including Charles William (1795&#150;1815), John Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1836), Joseph Milner (<i>d</i>. 1855), and Johnson Miles Christopher (1810&#150;1831). Their daughter Elizabeth Sarah would later become the mother of Sir M. W. Thompson, the railway director and Bradford's mayor and MP. Shortly after his marriage, in 1792, Atkinson was presented by the lord chancellor to the rectory of Warham All Saints, Norfolk. Atkinson was described as a &#145;man of rare scholarly attainment, but of somewhat eccentric character&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>). He was said to have been of Herculean build, and was noted in his youth for his good looks and carefully cut clothes. He died at the home of his son Joseph Milner Atkinson in Boston, Yorkshire, on 30 September 1846.<br>
