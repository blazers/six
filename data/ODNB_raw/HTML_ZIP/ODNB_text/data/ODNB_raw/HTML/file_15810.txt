<span class="headword">Kuper, Sir  Augustus Leopold</span>  (1809&#150;1885), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 16 August 1809, the son of William Kuper DD KH (<i>d</i>. 27 Nov 1861), later chaplain to Queen Adelaide. He entered the navy in April 1823, and after serving on the South American and Mediterranean stations was promoted lieutenant on 28 February 1830. During the next seven years he served almost continuously on the home station, and the coast of Spain or Portugal. He married, in June 1837, Emma Margaret, (<i>d</i>. 1877), eldest daughter of Sir Gordon Bremer; they had at least four sons and one daughter. In July 1837 Kuper was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Alligator</i> (28 guns) with his father-in-law. He assisted Bremer in forming the settlement of Port Essington in north Australia, and on 27 July 1839 was promoted by him to the command of the <i>Pelorus</i> (18 guns). In a violent hurricane at Port Essington the <i>Pelorus</i> was driven on shore, high and dry, and was got off with great difficulty and labour after eighty-six days. On 5 March 1840 Bremer, then senior officer in India, appointed Kuper acting captain of the <i>Alligator</i> (5 guns), and in June 1841 moved him to the <i>Calliope</i> (26 guns), in which he was confirmed by the Admiralty with seniority from 5 June 1841. In the <i>Alligator</i>, and afterwards in the <i>Calliope</i>, he was active during the First Opium War, and was honourably mentioned for his conduct at the capture of Chusan (Zhoushan) in July 1840, at the capture of the Bogue (Humen) forts in February 1841, and in the operations leading up to the surrender of Canton (Guangzhou). He was made a CB on 21 January 1842. From 1850 to 1853 he commanded the frigate <i>Thetis</i> in the Pacific, and for a few months in 1855 the <i>London</i> in the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1861 Kuper was promoted rear-admiral, and in the autumn of 1862 succeeded Sir James Hope as commander-in-chief in China, in the aftermath of the Taiping uprising. Kuper's first task was to capture the Taiping stronghold Kahding (Jiading), which he did on 23 October 1862. He was quickly called away to arrange matters in Japan, where the great nobles were angry at the treaties with Western nations, and the threatened introduction of foreigners and foreign customs. On 14 September 1862 a small party of British riding in the country was savagely attacked by retainers of the daimio of Satsuma, and one was killed. Reparation and compensation were demanded both from the imperial government and from the prince of Satsuma, and as they were not given, Kuper was requested to bring the squadron into the Bay of Yokohama. He arrived there in March 1863, and under this threat, following the suspension of diplomatic relations, the Japanese government agreed to pay the &pound;100,000 demanded. But Satsuma proved less compliant, and on 14 August Kuper brought the squadron before Kagosima. The next day three steamers belonging to the prince were seized. Thereupon his batteries opened fire, and were speedily silenced. Satsuma's palace was shelled, and by an accident the greater part of the town was burned. On 16 August 1863 the prince submitted to the British demands.<br>
<br>The following year the daimio of Nagato, whose batteries commanded the Strait of Simonoseki, the ordinary and most convenient channel into the inland sea, closed the navigation to foreigners. The French and Dutch squadrons, and one United States warship, made common cause with the British, and acted under the orders of the British admiral. The ships opened fire at 4 p.m. on 5 September, and by the next day all the batteries had been silenced and stormed. On 7 September negotiations began, and it was soon agreed that all ships of all countries passing through the Strait of Simonoseki should be treated in a friendly manner. The battle led not only to the opening of the inland sea, but to the downfall of the old &#145;country&#146; party in Japan, and to a social and political revolution there.<br>
<br>In 1865 Kuper returned to England. He had no further service. He had been made a KCB on 25 February 1864, for his services at Kagosima; and on 2 June 1869 he was made GCB. On 6 April 1866 he became a vice-admiral, and on 20 October 1872 admiral. Kuper died at his home, The Rock, South Brent, near Totnes, Devon, on 29 October 1885.<br>
