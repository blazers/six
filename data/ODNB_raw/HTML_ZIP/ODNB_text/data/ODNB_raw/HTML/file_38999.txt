<span class="headword">Gamage,  Albert Walter</span>  (1855&#150;1930), <span class="occ">retail entrepreneur and department store owner</span>, was born on 14 July 1855 at Hereford, the seventeenth child of Henry Gamage, a plumber and glazier, and his wife, Tryphina Carr. After leaving the local school he was apprenticed to a draper at Winslow, Buckinghamshire. At the age of nineteen he went to London, finding work initially with the drapery firm of Spencer Turner and Boldero of Lisson Grove, and then at the wholesale drapery warehouse of Hitchcock, Williams &amp; Co. at St Paul's Churchyard. As was usual at that time he lived in at both his early jobs.<br>
<br>After gaining some experience in the drapery business Gamage joined with a young colleague Frank Spain, and in 1878 the pair used their savings of &pound;150 to lease a small hosiery shop, with a tiny frontage of just 5 feet, at 128 Holborn. Years later Gamage told how his career as a shop owner and the location of his business were both determined by a chance remark from a local trader who told him that Holborn needed a good hosiery shop. The pair's first success came with the sale of special hairbrushes, which they sold far more cheaply than any of their competitors. This gave Gamage the idea of bulk buying goods of reasonable quality and then lowering profit margins to undersell rival shopkeepers. Gamage was ambitious and by 1881 he had bought out his partner and set about reorganizing the small but highly competitive business for further growth. Gamage brought about this expansion by widening his merchandise and selling new products. He left no stone unturned in his search for new products, travelling extensively throughout Europe and North America. In later years his travels to seek out new goods became legendary: tales were told of how he battled through blizzards in the wilds of Michigan in search of a new toy gun for his store. He became the largest importer of Steiff toys, including the now famous Steiff bear, after visiting Frau Steiff's toy factory in the Black Forest. Gamage was always quick to spot new products and related consumer booms. He was quick, for instance, to exploit the popularity of cycling following the introduction of the new safety bicycle in 1885: he promptly made arrangements for cycles to be manufactured under the Gamage label, and because of his direct bulk purchasing, was able to undercut all competitors. His business maxim was &#145;Always be satisfied with small profits.&#146;<br>
<br>The increased range of goods sold by Gamage necessitated changes in the size and arrangement of the store. Both were achieved in something of a piecemeal fashion as Gamage spread his business by buying up adjoining premises, creating by the turn of the century a department store which covered almost 2 acres of floorspace housed behind an impressive neo-Gothic fa&ccedil;ade. Unlike many of London's other department stores, Gamage's was oriented less toward the female shopper and more at the men working in the nearby City. But of course many of these office workers were family men who at weekends came on shopping trips to Gamages with their wives and children. Indeed the store's Christmas bazaar was a children's dream, always presenting new toys often searched out by Gamage himself.<br>
<br>Gamage was always a retail innovator. He developed strong links with his suppliers, often using small manufacturers, who produced exclusively for him, in a bid to bypass those firms that disapproved of his price cutting. When cars started to become more widely available he sold cars manufactured under the Gamage name and opened a new motoring department in the store. His thousand-page mail-order catalogue was one of the first of its kind and the range of products on offer provides an interesting insight into Edwardian consumer society. Gamage's penchant for advertising was strong, and although not a showman like his rival William Whiteley, he originated many ideas. He was the first to take out full-page newspaper advertisements, using the whole front page of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> on 12 July 1904 to announce enlargements to his store, which he named the People's Popular Emporium.<br>
<br>The store's development of sporting goods strongly reflected Gamage's own love of games. He became president of many athletic clubs, as well as the donor of a large number of challenge cups and shields. He was also a strong supporter of working men's clubs. In 1888 Gamage married the second daughter of J. G. Murdoch. There were two sons and one daughter from the marriage. One of Gamage's other passions was his home at Grange Farm, Charteridge, Buckinghamshire, which he acquired during the 1920s. Despite such diversions he never neglected the store, which grew from strength to strength, having a turnover in 1930 of over &pound;1 million per year and employing some 2000 people. The business was a family-run affair, with Gamage's son Eric becoming managing director. The firm was closed in 1972 and the building demolished.<br>
<br>Gamage died at Charteridge after a long illness, on 5 April 1930. He was &#145;laid in state&#146; in the store's motor department with his staff standing guard, encouraged to do so by the unprecedented offer of a Saturday afternoon holiday.<br>
