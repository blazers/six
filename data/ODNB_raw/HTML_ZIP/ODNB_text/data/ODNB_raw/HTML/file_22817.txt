<span class="headword">Prysot <span class="st"> [Prisot]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1461), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of John Prisot of Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire; suggestions that his family came from Kent appear to be unfounded. The early stages of his career are unknown, but from the late 1430s he is recorded as active in Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire&#151;his marriage brought him the manor of Wallington in the latter county. He was a JP in Cambridgeshire from 1437, escheator in that county and Huntingdonshire in 1438, and a JP in Hertfordshire from 1443 (presumably in consequence of his marriage), as well as in other counties in the south midlands and East Anglia from the late 1440s. In July 1443 he became a serjeant-at-law, and he was promoted king's serjeant at the following Michaelmas. His contributions to courtroom debate at once begin to be recorded in the year-books. Between 1445 and 1447 he was retained by the duchy of Lancaster, while in 1448 he was a justice of assize and gaol delivery for the liberty of Ely.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1449 Prysot was appointed chief justice of the court of common pleas, even though he had not previously been a puisne justice, and was granted &pound;93 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per annum and additional sums for his robes. He was soon active away from Westminster in the service of the crown, as a commissioner of oyer and terminer in Kent in 1451, after Jack Cade's uprising, in the same capacity in Lincolnshire in 1452, in the aftermath of the duke of York's demonstration at Dartford, and at York in 1454 &#145;for execution of justice uppon such as hafe offended yn cause creminall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 1.290). He was a trier of petitions from Gascony and overseas territories in the parliaments of 1453 and 1455. In the latter year he was a member of the Hertfordshire commission for raising funds for the defence of Calais, while in 1459 he became a feoffee to the use by the crown of various duchy of Lancaster estates. He appears to have been knighted in that year. He was frequently employed as a commissioner by the king, and was also engaged in private business as a feoffee and arbitrator.<br>
<br>Prysot was known as a learned judge&#151;he is recorded as citing a law book of Edward I's time which was probably <span class="italic">Britton</span>. His opinions are frequently recorded in the law reports, for instance in his argument for statute as the only &#145;positive&#146; law, taking precedence over prescription. He was said to have assisted Sir Thomas Littleton (<i>d</i>. 1481) in the preparation of the latter's <span class="italic">Tenures</span>, and his opinions were still being referred to over a century after his death. Ordinances issued on 1 July 1457 for the behaviour and fees of the officials of the court of common pleas are described as having been drawn up under his direction. A complaint of his partiality in the conduct of business at Norwich in July 1451 should be regarded with scepticism, as emanating from a disappointed litigant. Prysot died early in 1461, probably shortly before 17 May, when the parson of Clothall, Hertfordshire, near Wallington, was granted administration of his will. He may have been buried in the north chapel of St Mary's Church, Wallington, where stained glass survives bearing his arms. He was outlived by his wife, Margaret, who was still living in 1475, and by their daughter, Anne, who married George Dallyson.<br>
