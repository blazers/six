<span class="headword">Wishart,  Ernest Edward</span>  (1902&#150;1987), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 11 August 1902, at 25 Alleyn Park, Dulwich, London, the only son of Sir Sidney Wishart (1854&#150;1935), then an insurance broker, and his wife, Alice Maud, daughter of William Heseltine. His father became sheriff and a lieutenant of the City of London and commander of the 6th London brigade of the Royal Field Artillery. He had a country house at Binsted, near Arundel, Sussex. Wishart had one sister. He was educated at Rugby School, and in 1920 went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a third in part one of the history tripos in 1922, and a third in part two of the law tripos in 1923.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge, instead of following his father into the City, in 1925 Ernest Wishart provided the financial backing for a new publishing house, Wishart &amp; Co., at 19 Buckingham Street, London, which he founded with a Cambridge friend, the poet Douglas Garman. On 11 June 1927 Wishart married Garman's sister <a href="#cosubject_73714">Lorna [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The first publication of Wishart &amp; Co. was the <span class="italic">Calendar of Modern Letters</span>, the project of a group of young writers including Garman. A literary review, which appeared monthly from March 1925 for the first year, and then quarterly after the circulation dropped from over 7000 to under 3000, it was edited by the left-wing poet and critic Edgell Rickword, with the help of Douglas Garman. It was intended as a rival to T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Criterion</span> magazine, and contributions included critical re-evaluations of earlier twentieth-century writers including Sir James Barrie and Bernard Shaw, by Rickword, and of Walter de la Mare, by Garman. It also included poetry by Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon, a short story, &#145;The Princess&#146;, by D. H. Lawrence, reviews by Bertrand Russell, and &#145;The Zeit Geist&#146;, an essay by Edwin Muir. Although publication ceased after circulation had dropped to 1000, the <span class="italic">Calendar of Modern Letters</span> inspired F. R. Leavis to start <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span> in 1932.<br>
<br>Although Wishart had Marxist sympathies, he never joined the Communist Party, unlike Rickword, who did so in 1934, and Garman, Wishart &amp; Co. continued to publish work by left-wing writers. After Jonathan Cape and Victor Gollancz had turned down <span class="italic">Negro</span>, an anthology of pieces by 150 writers on black politics and culture, collected and edited by Nancy Cunard, Wishart agreed to publish it in 1934 on the understanding that she would pay all the expenses. In her introduction, Nancy Cunard supported the claim of the Communist Party to be the champion of the black race. Wishart &amp; Co. also published Geoffrey Gorer's <span class="italic">The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade</span> (1934), with an introduction by the Marxist intellectual J. B. S. Haldane.<br>
<br>In 1935 Wishart &amp; Co. merged with the publishing house of Martin Lawrence, becoming Lawrence and Wishart, and moved to Red Lion Square, London. It became the press of the Communist Party of Great Britain, with a list after the Second World War that included the Marxist historians Eric Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, and E. P. Thompson. In co-operation with the Institute of Marxism-Leninism and Progress Publishers in Moscow, it began to publish the definitive English-language edition of the complete works of Marx and Engels: by 2002 forty-eight of the fifty volumes had been published. In 1941&#150;2 the first six volumes of the <span class="roman">Little Stalin Library</span> appeared. In 1955 Lawrence and Wishart published the first unabridged version of Robert Tressell's novel <span class="italic">The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</span> (1914). They also published the official history of the Communist Party of Great Britain, whose first four volumes appeared between 1969 and 1997.<br>
<br>In 1936 Lawrence and Wishart took over the publication of <span class="roman">New Writing</span>, the literary series started and edited by John Lehmann, when the Bodley Head severed its connection after the first two numbers. Wishart published numbers 3, 4, and 5, offering copies at a discount to members of Victor Gollancz's Left Book Club, but after the appearance of volume 5 in the spring of 1938, he lost interest, possibly because he disapproved of Lehmann's attitude to the Spanish Civil War. The Hogarth Press took over the publication of <span class="roman">New Writing</span> until 1940, when it became <span class="roman">Penguin New Writing</span>. In December 1937 Lawrence and Wishart joined Gollancz in launching another journal, the <span class="italic">Modern Quarterly</span>, which merged with the <span class="italic">Communist Review</span> in 1954 to become the <span class="italic">Marxist Quarterly</span>. They continued to publish it until 1957.<br>
<br>Although Wishart did not give up his stake in Lawrence and Wishart, he took little part in the business after the beginning of the Second World War. He lent his London house to the Czech government in exile, and moved to his estate at Binsted. He spent the rest of his life managing his farms, and pursuing his interest in architecture and local history. He gave a medieval round house to the Museum of Agricultural History in West Dean, Sussex, and became patron of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Wishart died on 16 September 1987 at Yew Tree House, North End Road, Yapton, Sussex.<br>
<br>Wishart's wife, <a name="cosubject_73714"></a><span class="headword">Lorna Cecilia Wishart</span>  (1911&#150;2000)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 11 January 1911 at Black Hall, King's Pyon, Herefordshire, the youngest child in the family of seven daughters and two sons of Walter Chancellor Garman (<i>d</i>. 1923), a wealthy doctor. Released from boarding-school on the death of her father, she led a carefree teenage life, &#145;roaring about on the back of boys' motorbikes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Her two eldest sisters had by then already moved to London, Kathleen becoming the mistress and later wife of the sculptor Jacob Epstein, and Mary marrying the poet Roy Campbell. Lorna herself soon followed. She married Ernest Wishart at the age of sixteen, having been introduced by her elder brother Douglas. By the age of twenty-one she was the mother of their two sons, Michael [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63172/', "Wishart, (John) Michael Garman")</script>] and Luke. She first met the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66180/', "Laurence Edward Alan (Laurie) Lee (1914&#150;1997)")</script> in 1937 while she was holidaying with her husband and sons at Gunwalloe, Cornwall. She lived with Lee from February 1938 to May 1939, and in March 1939 gave birth to his daughter, Yasmin. Though Lorna Wishart returned to her husband&#151;who agreed to bring up Yasmin as his own daughter&#151;the affair continued until 1943, when she transferred her affections to the young painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103935/', "Lucian Freud (1922&#150;2011)")</script>, leaving Lee desolate. Freud painted her in <span class="italic">Girl with daffodil</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">Woman with a tulip</span> (1945). He, too, was left broken-hearted when she returned to her husband and embraced Roman Catholicism. Both Lee and Freud went on to marry her nieces. Described in her youth as a woman of exceptional beauty, Lorna Wishart was, in her daughter's words, &#145;savage, wild, romantic and completely without guilt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). Following her conversion to Roman Catholicism she destroyed all her letters from Lee and Freud, devoted herself to supporting her husband, and led a blameless, though eccentric, life at their house at Binsted in the Sussex downs, where she created a notable garden. She died at Walberton Place Nursing Home, Walberton, West Sussex, on 12 January 2000, of bronchopneumonia and cerebral arteriosclerosis, survived by her son Luke and daughter Yasmin, her son Michael having predeceased her.<br>
