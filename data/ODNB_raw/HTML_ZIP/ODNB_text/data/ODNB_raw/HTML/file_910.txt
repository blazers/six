<span class="headword">Austin,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1752, <em>d.</em> before 1838), <span class="occ">music stenographer and inventor of a power-loom</span>, was born at Craigton, near Glasgow, on 17 April 1752, the son of the gardener to John Baird, esquire. Nothing is known of Austin's early life or education. On 30 May 1777 he married Janet Graham, with whom he had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Austin is believed to have started in business as a manufacturer with James Monteith, Robert Thomson, and the M'Ilquham firm about 1789. In that year he made his first attempt to invent for the weaving of cloth a power-loom capable of being driven by water or steam. In 1796 the chamber of commerce and manufacturers at Glasgow issued a favourable report on his invention, and in 1798 it was successfully employed at James Monteith's spinning-works at Pollokshaws, 4 miles from Glasgow; Monteith erected first a building to hold 30 looms and afterwards another to hold 200. The power-loom, in a further improved state, was submitted for inspection to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1806 and won a silver medal. Austin's letter to the society, enumerating twenty-two advantages of his power-loom over traditional looms, was published in 1807 in W. Nicolson's <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts</span> (new ser., 17, pp. 175&#150;7). Austin entered a caveat for a patent but abandoned the idea of obtaining one.<br>
<br>Engaged by artistic as well as scientific pursuits, Austin was<blockquote>long known, in an extended circle of acquaintances, for his musical skill, and an inventive, speculative genius. Possessed of a jovial disposition, his company was greatly prized, and he was ever ready to take part in a catch or glee. (Kay, 2.376)</blockquote>He wrote <span class="italic">A System of Stenographic Music, Invented by J. Austin, Glasgow</span> (1820?), a system of shorthand musical notation consisting of the use of six characters on a single line, a method that, &#145;however ingenious theoretically considered, would have been practically useless&#146;  (Baptie, 7).<br>
<br>A remarkably clever and genial man, with a philosophical temperament, Austin once joked that he wished himself in prison so that he might have time to pursue his ideas undisturbed. Although corpulent, Austin was energetic, capable of gymnastic feats:<blockquote>On one occasion, when locked up in a jury case, by way of amusement, he seated himself on the ground, and holding up his feet with his hands, astonished his fellow-jurors by hobbling in this position round the room. (Kay, 2.377)</blockquote>He was said to bear a striking resemblance to the jolly landlord in <span class="italic">Smithfield Sharpers</span>, a print engraved by Sherwin after a design by Rowlandson. Although the exact date of Austin's death is unknown, it is certain that he died before 1838  (Baptie).<br>
