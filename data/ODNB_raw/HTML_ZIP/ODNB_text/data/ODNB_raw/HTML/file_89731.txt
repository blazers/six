<span class="headword">Hern,  William Richard <span class="st"> [Dick]</span></span>  (1921&#150;2002), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, was born on 20 January 1921 at Holford, Somerset, the eldest surviving son of William Roderick (Roy) Hern, a gentleman farmer, and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mullens. He was educated at Norfolk House preparatory school, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, and (from 1935 to 1938) at Monmouth School. After failing his army entrance exam he went to Millfield School, Somerset, for a year and then to Jesus College, Cambridge, for two terms to read engineering. In December 1940 he was called up and served with the North Irish horse as a tank commander in north Africa and Italy, where he organized an impromptu race meeting in Ravenna and was later wounded in the neck. After demobilization with the rank of major in 1946 he took a three-month course at Porlock Vale riding school, Somerset, stayed on as an instructor, and helped to coach the 1952 Olympic equestrian team. In 1952 a wartime comrade, Major Michael Pope, now a racehorse trainer at Blewbury, Berkshire, took him on as his assistant. On 9 October 1956 Hern married Sheilah Joan Davis (1926/7&#150;1998), secretary, and daughter of Robert James Green Davis. There were no children of the marriage, which lasted until her death.<br>
<br>In 1957 Hern moved to Lagrange, Newmarket, to become private trainer to Major Lionel Holliday, for whom he won the 1962 St Leger with Hethersett. That year he was champion trainer, the second youngest man to be so since the war. (He was champion trainer again in 1972, 1980, and 1983.) In 1962 he moved to West Ilsley, Berkshire, at the invitation of Sir John (Jakie) Astor to replace the recently retired Jack Colling. Astor sold the stables to Michael Sobell and Arnold Weinstock in 1969, but Hern remained there as their trainer, though he was allowed to take on other horses. These included Brigadier Gerard, an outstanding animal, beaten only once in eighteen outings in three seasons and capturing some of the biggest prizes on the British turf. Hern also began to train for the queen and in 1974 saddled Highclere to win her the One Thousand Guineas, followed by Dunfermline's Oaks and St Leger in her silver jubilee year. In 1982 her purchase of the West Ilsley stables rendered Hern her tenant, with his rent partly determined by his winnings as a trainer.<br>
<br>Several factors contributed to Hern's success as a trainer, including patience with his charges and attention to detail. He was a disciplinarian, a vital quality in a racing yard, but also gave and earned loyalty, though he was criticized for not resigning when the stable jockey Joe Mercer was sacked by Weinstock. Above all he was a horseman in all senses of the word. He could spot an incipient lameness or ailment well before others and take remedial action. From the owners' perspective he was a man of integrity. He had little time for the press, maintaining that what happened with his horses was a matter solely for himself and the owners. Known to punters as the Major, his racecourse persona was that of the army officer on parade, but at home and with friends he was less aloof, enjoying parties and contributing ribald and profane ditties to the entertainment.<br>
<br>Hern loved hunting. He had followed the hounds from childhood and continued until 1984, when he fell while out with the Quorn and broke his neck. Henceforth he was confined to a wheelchair, from which he continued to conduct his training operations. Four years later, however, he underwent major heart surgery, which led to a bitter controversy in British racing. While Hern was recuperating, Lord Carnarvon, the queen's racing manager, decided not to renew his lease at West Ilsley. He considered that Hern was unfit to continue training. Ultimately, after intercession from the trainer Ian Balding, Hern was allowed a further year at West Ilsley and then another season sharing the stables with William Hastings-Bass, a godson of Lord Carnarvon. Many in racing, especially the race-going public, were appalled at the treatment of Hern and there were emotional scenes at Newmarket in 1989 when Nashwan, trained by Hern, won the Two Thousand Guineas. Nashwan went on to win the Derby, the last of Hern's sixteen domestic classic victories, as well as the Eclipse Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes. Nashwan's owner, Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai's finance minister, built the Kingwood stables at Lambourn specifically for Hern to move into.<br>
<br>Hern retired from training at the end of the 1997 season and was made CBE in 1998 (to add to his CVO of 1980) as well as being given honorary membership of the Jockey Club. Following his wife's death (from cancer), he was reunited with an early love, Patricia (Pat) Wykeham-Fiennes, the widow of Richard Shedden. They had met at Porlock but Hern's financial prospects at the time had ruled out marriage. He continued to own shares in a handful of horses and, despite failing health, took an interest in their performances almost to the day of his death. He died on 22 May 2002 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, from septicaemia and a urinary tract infection, leaving an estate valued at just over &pound;1 million.<br>
