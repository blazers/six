<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanley,  Henry</span>, fourth earl of Derby  (1531&#150;1593), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born in September and baptized on 4 October 1531 at Lathom House, Lancashire, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26262/', "Edward Stanley, third earl of Derby (1509&#150;1572)")</script>, magnate, and his first wife, Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk, and his second wife, Agnes. Stanley was among the young lords educated with Edward VI and attended his coronation on 20 February 1547, at which he was created KB. He was a gentleman of the privy chamber and was styled Lord Strange until he succeeded his father in October 1572. Strange was sent as a hostage to France in April 1550 with Edward Seymour, second earl of Hertford, and other noblemen's sons. Upon his return, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, recruited his support. Somerset, it was claimed, encouraged Strange to convince Edward to marry the duke's daughter Jane, to keep watch on the young king's words and deeds, and to report any secret conferences Edward had with his privy councillors. These proceedings formed one of the principal charges on which Somerset was condemned, though he denied them at his trial in December 1551.<br>
<br>With the accession of Mary I Strange was appointed gentleman of the privy chamber to Philip of Spain in July 1554. He issued a challenge on 25 November to fight Don Federico de Toledo &#145;at the barriers&#146; on 4 December, which was not taken up  (BL, Add. MS 33735, fol. 6<i>v</i>). Strange married Margaret (1540&#150;1596), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5648/', "Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland (1517&#150;1570)")</script>, and his first wife, Eleanor, in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall Palace, on 7 February 1555. The ceremony was marked by the introduction of a Spanish game, <i>juego de canas</i>, with the title &#145;jube the cane&#146; or &#145;jube the sane&#146;  (Heywood, 1.12). Margaret was granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister, Mary, duchess of Suffolk, who had some claim to the crown, but Strange kept these claims in the background and they never became an issue. He had frequent quarrels with his wife, leading to their eventual separation. They had four sons: Edward, who died young, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26269/', "Ferdinando Stanley, fifth earl of Derby (1559?&#150;1594)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72296/', "William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby (bap. 1561, d. 1642)")</script>, and Francis, who also died young.<br>
<br>Strange entered parliament as Baron Strange on 23 January 1559. He became a member of Gray's Inn in 1562, and was made an honorary MA of Oxford University on 6 September 1566. He succeeded his father as earl and as lord lieutenant of Lancashire on 24 October 1572. Serving as commissioner for ecclesiastical causes, he was an active member of Elizabeth I's council of the north. He did not share his father's Catholicism, his protestantism stemming from his upbringing at Edward's court. Derby patronized young protestant clergy and espoused protestant theological views. As Lancashire became religiously divided in the 1570s he prosecuted recusants vigorously, but he continued to assist Catholics who had been family friends, and was slow to prosecute them in the face of new legislation which he was empowered to enforce. Thus he was accused of being too lax on Catholics in 1587, and there was an attempt to purge his ecclesiastical commission for the diocese of Chester.<br>
<br>Admitted a knight of the Garter on 24 April 1574, Derby was made ambassador-extraordinary to confer the insignia of the Order of the Garter on Henri III of France on 20 January 1585. He was sworn of the privy council on 20 May 1585, and appointed a commissioner to try Mary, queen of Scots, on 6 October 1586. Derby was made chief commissioner to treat with Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, for peace with Spain at Ostend in January 1588, for which he kept a diary  (BL, Sloane MS 262). Throughout these diplomatic missions he kept Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, informed of his activities. Derby was appointed lord high steward on 23 March 1589 for several treason trials, including that of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, in the following month.<br>
<br>Derby was an active local governor. He wrote many letters concerning the management of castles, ports, and harbours, and instructions to county and borough JPs. He tried to appoint town officials in Chester, Liverpool, and Preston, and to place nominees in county and borough parliamentary elections. Success was limited. He also kept accounts of revenues and household expenses of his Lancashire and Cheshire estates, as well as Manx revenues and exchequer customs accounts at Douglas on the Isle of Man. Derby visited Man in 1577 and 1583 to improve his rental income, attacking the &#145;tenure of straw&#146; customs enjoyed by his tenants there  (Coward, &#145;Crisis&#146;, 72&#150;3). Placing hope on increased revenues from Man, however, was unfulfilled as the Stanley estates there were losing their economic value in the late sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Derby, however, was considered a spendthrift. Always short of money, he borrowed over &pound;2000 between 1562 and 1568, and sold several manors in subsequent years. Part of the problem was that his father did not trust his business acumen, accusing him of making &#145;evill bargaines&#146;. Thus the third earl entailed most of his estates in trust to his male heirs to prevent his immediate heir from dissipating them  (Coward, <span class="italic">Stanleys</span>, 29&#150;31). The fourth earl's household staff reached 118 in 1587, and 145 by 1590. His wife, Margaret, was equally profligate. Derby had to sell lands worth &pound;1500 in 1567 to pay her creditors. One of his claims for separation at Gaddesden in Hertfordshire in 1567 was her inability to run their household. Thus he took all their plate and goods to London in order to raise money for her debts. The privy council wrote to the lord mayor of London to persuade creditors not to harass her in 1579, appointed a commission to reduce her debts in 1581, and the queen allowed her to sell her inheritance the following year.<br>
<br>Derby's common-law marriage about 1570 to Jane Halsall of Knowsley, Lancashire, a local acquaintance, brought him at least four more children and more debts than he could handle. By 1570 his diplomatic missions, with a train of eighty gentlemen and yeomen and an entourage of 220, brought him close to insolvency. Desperate, he tried to enclose his lands and release them with increased rents. Trying to provide for his illegitimate children, in 1582 Derby set aside &pound;660 and &pound;100 per annum to be paid out of his rents; if the money was not there, his son Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange, was obligated to pay the remainder from his properties or they would be distrained. By 1593 Derby owed sureties of &pound;8732 to London merchants and had to sell the rest of his outlying estates.<br>
<br>Derby died at Lathom House on 25 September 1593, and was buried in his father's chapel at the parish church of Ormskirk, Lancashire, on 4 December. In his will, written on 21 September, Derby was quite positive of his hope of achieving salvation. He gave all his goods and chattels to his servants towards payment of his debts, his Lancashire and Cheshire lands to his son Lord Strange, and those in York, Somerset, Oxfordshire, and Middlesex to William. He obliged Strange to keep all his servants, with generous pensions paid out of his rents for any servants he released. His common-law wife survived him, and Margaret died in Cleveland Row, Middlesex, on 29 September 1596 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 22 October.<br>
<br>Derby acquired a love of letters and music from his wife, Margaret. He met actors, poets, heralds, and wrestlers, and invited them to perform at his house. Plays were given in his honour at Chester in the 1570s, and several writers of prose and verse dedicated their works to him. He was patron of a company of actors called &#145;Derby's Men&#146; which performed before the queen on 14 February 1580 and which became more famous under the patronage of the fifth earl.<br>
