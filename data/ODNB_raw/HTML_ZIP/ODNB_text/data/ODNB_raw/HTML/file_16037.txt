<span class="headword">Langtoft,  Peter</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1305), <span class="occ">Augustinian canon and chronicler</span>, was a canon of Bridlington Priory by 1271 at the latest. His surname, very common in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, is a place name of Scandinavian origin (<i>long toft</i>) attested in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. Very little is known of his life. Until 1286 he represented Prior Geoffrey of Nafferton and the house in a series of negotiations, some of them at Westminster, but in 1293 he left Bridlington without permission from the archbishop of York, John Romanus. Probably he then settled near London and the court. But there is no further trace of him.<br>
<br>With twenty-one medieval manuscripts still surviving, his work seems to have been the most widely diffused Anglo-Norman chronicle after the <span class="italic">Brut d'Engleterre</span> and Wace's <span class="italic">Brut</span>. His chronicle consists in fact of three books, all of them in verse: an abridgement and adaptation of Wace's <span class="italic">Brut</span>, 3010 lines long; a history of Saxon and Norman kings until the death of Henry III, 4200 lines long; and a history of Edward I, with whom he was contemporary. This third book, which is the most informative, consists of 2022 lines in its first redaction and 2591 lines in its second.<br>
<br>Langtoft wrote his account of Edward I's reign long after the first two books, putting pen to parchment again only in 1294, at the request of a friend he calls Schafeld, and summing up the years 1272&#150;94 in 370 lines. This friend was very probably John Sheffield, a royal clerk, sheriff of Durham from 1302 and of Northumberland from 1305, and a faithful supporter of Antony (I) Bek, bishop of Durham.<br>
<br>It is thus not surprising that, in its earliest form, the text emphasizes the military and political fight Bek put up against the Scots. After 1296 and the victory of the English foot soldiers at Dunbar, the text divides into two different redactions, neither of which, it seems, was completed by Langtoft himself. In the first, which is the closest to him in time, the text was continued until 1305 and the execution of William Wallace, or even until 1306 and the execution of the earl of Atholl. Then an adapter, probably a courtier, who was indifferent to Bek and Durham, rather Francophile, and heavily influenced by contemporary French idioms, altered this first redaction, to show Robert Bruce, future king of Scots, as a mere murderer premeditating the killing of John Comyn, his competitor for the throne, in February 1306. This report, purporting to be testimony contemporary with the event, is a masterpiece of royal propaganda.<br>
<br>The other redaction extends to and includes Edward's death. Most of the manuscripts containing it can be localized in north-east England; it thus seems to express the feelings of gentry dwelling there. In particular it shows distrust of Edward, who was regarded as too lenient towards the Scots and unwilling to make a proper distribution of the lands he had conquered or to limit the boundaries of the royal forests.<br>
<br>The three books of the chronicle were composed in Anglo-Norman alexandrines gathered into long stanzas which use a single rhyme or assonance and produce an epic flavour. The main literary feature of the third book (<span class="italic">The Reign of Edward I</span>) is the addition of a few stanzas of short satirical lines, bilingual or composed in Middle English, extremely nationalistic and anti-Scottish, with alliterative and tripartite schemes. These lines appear again as independent and purely English poems in some manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Brut of England</span> and in Robert Fabyan's <span class="italic">New Chronicles</span>.<br>
<br>In 1338 Robert Mannyng, a Gilbertine canon in Sixhills Priory, Lincolnshire, completed &#145;for the love of simple men&#146;  (Mannyng, 1.77) a Middle English adaptation of Langtoft's chronicle as a whole. But for the first book he substituted a direct translation of Wace's <span class="italic">Brut</span> and for the third he translated the second redaction only. The first redaction of this <span class="italic">Reign of Edward I</span> did in fact enter the Anglo-Norman <span class="italic">Brut d'Engleterre</span> and eventually the <span class="italic">Chronicles of England</span> printed by Caxton in 1480. Only three medieval manuscripts of Mannyng's text are still surviving, so that it seems to have been much less widespread than Langtoft's.<br>
<br>A Princeton University manuscript (Princeton University Library, Taylor MS 12), datable to the middle of the fourteenth century, attributes to Langtoft the translation into Anglo-Norman alexandrines of three political letters, the Latin text of which was very common in the medieval libraries of England. These letters are: a bull of Pope Boniface VIII, presented to Edward I on 26 August 1299 by Archbishop Winchelsey, declaring that Scotland had never been vassal to the king of England, but on the contrary had always depended on the Holy See; a letter sent to Boniface VIII on 12 February 1301 by the English barons proclaiming their determination to prevent the king from giving up any of his rights; and, longer than the previous letters, Edward's personal reply dated 17 May 1301, in which his suzerainty over Scotland appears to be largely grounded on the Arthurian history of Britain. Whether in the translation or in the authentic text, the spirit of this reply recalls Langtoft's chronicle itself, and the argument displayed is the one Edward I and Antony Bek expected from the monasteries when they consulted them about the succession of Scotland in 1291. These translated letters are in long single-rhymed stanzas, like those of the chronicle, and contain a total of 673 lines.<br>
<br>The scribe of BL, Cotton MS Julius A.v, wrongly attributes to Langtoft an allegorical poem on the passion of Christ, but with more probability a lament of the Virgin recalling St Bernard's <span class="italic">De planctu Virginis Marie</span>.<br>
