<span class="headword">Waugh,  Alexander</span>  (1754&#150;1827), <span class="occ">United Secession minister</span>, was born at East Gordon, Berwickshire, on 16 August 1754, the youngest of three children of Thomas Waugh (<i>d</i>. 1783), farmer, and his wife, Margaret Johnstone. From his earliest years he was destined for the ministry. After attending the parish school at Gordon he entered the grammar school at Earlston in 1766, from which he progressed to Edinburgh University in 1770, where he showed a particular aptitude for moral philosophy. In the same year Waugh joined a congregation of the Burgher branch of the Secession church at Stichill, and in 1774 he began to study divinity under John Brown (1722&#150;1787) at Haddington. In 1777 he attended, for a session, the classes of Beattie and Campbell at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA the following year.<br>
<br>Having been licensed at Duns by the presbytery of Edinburgh on 28 June 1779 Waugh briefly supplied for the Wells Street congregation in London, vacant since the death of Archibald Hall (1736&#150;1778). He returned to Scotland and was called by the small congregation of Newtown, Roxburghshire, which had not previously enjoyed a stated ministry, and was ordained there on 30 August 1780. The charge was inconvenient, in that there was no manse and Waugh had to travel some miles to attend to his congregation. Moreover a call from Wells Street was soon received and twice repeated. Waugh transferred there in 1782 and began his ministry in London on 16 June. He married, on 10 August 1786 at Edincrow, Berwickshire, Mary Neill (<i>d</i>. 1840), daughter of William Neill and Margaret Henderson of that parish; they had four daughters and six sons.<br>
<br>Waugh's forty-five-year ministry at Wells Street was characterized by his virtues as a preacher and a pastor. The congregation prospered and the church itself was rebuilt during that time. Waugh worked readily with clergymen of other denominations and was a friend of national establishments. Nowhere was his non-denominational approach more evident than in his support for the London Missionary Society, his most cherished cause and one with which he was involved from its inception in 1795 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>]; for twenty-eight years he served as chairman of its examination committee. He supported a host of other religious and philanthropic bodies, including the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge, the Scottish Hospital, and Mill Hill Academy. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> and made missionary tours in England, Ireland, Scotland, and France. He was also instrumental, in 1812, in securing the adoption by his church of an enlarged psalmody. He was honoured with the degree of DD from Marischal College in 1815.<br>
<br>By nature Waugh was a cheerful, amiable, and kindly man, mild-mannered and free of any contentious tendencies: &#145;there was not an atom of fixed animosity in his whole composition&#146;  (Hay and Belfrage, 66). Though he presented a tall, striking, and apparently robust figure he was dogged by a dropsy-like ailment which at one point became so acute that in 1806 he retired to Scotland for a year. In May 1823 he sustained injuries from a fall when scaffolding gave way during the laying of the foundation stone of the Orphan Asylum, Clapton. The death of his son Alexander (1795&#150;1824), who had followed his father into the ministry of the Secession church, was another blow to him; Alexander had taken the opportunity to pursue his ministry in close proximity to his father as minister of the Scots Church in Mile Lane, London, and it was his <span class="italic">Sermons, Addresses and Expositions at the Holy Communion</span> that was published by his father, with a memoir, in 1825. Waugh died at his home in Salisbury Place, London, after a short illness, on 14 December 1827. A large crowd attended his funeral at Bunhill Fields on 22 December.<br>
