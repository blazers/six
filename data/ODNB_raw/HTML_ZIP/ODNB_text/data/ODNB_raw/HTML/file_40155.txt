<span class="headword">Manio,  Jean Baptiste  de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Jack  de Manio]</span>  (1914&#150;1988), <span class="occ">radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 26 January 1914 in Hampstead, London, the only child of Jean Baptiste de Manio (<i>d</i>. 1913), an Italian aviator, and his Polish wife, Florence Olga. Before he was born his father, the first person to fly across the English Channel in winter, was killed in a flying accident during a race to Lisbon. His mother, an eccentric and fashionable woman, never remarried but had many male admirers. She spoke eight languages but her English was bad, and de Manio later attributed his poor progress in reading and writing to this. He left Aldenham School without any academic qualifications, and got a job as an invoice clerk in a brewery in Spitalfields in the East End of London. For a time he then tried to make a career in the hotel business, first on the kitchen staff at Grosvenor House and as assistant to the wine waiter at the Ritz, and later as a waiter at the Miramar Hotel, Cannes. On 2 March 1935 he married Juliet Graveraet Kaufmann (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), daughter of Louis Graveraet Kaufmann, bank president. They had one son. Following his marriage de Manio lived in the United States for a short while, working on his wife's family's farm.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War de Manio was called up into the Royal Sussex regiment. In 1939&#150;40 he fought with the 7th battalion in the British expeditionary force in France, and from 1940 to 1944 he was with the 1st battalion, Middle East forces. He was awarded the MC in 1940, and a bar was added to it in north Africa. In 1944 he joined the forces broadcasting unit in Beirut. On leaving the army in 1946 he was able to get a job with the BBC Overseas Service as an announcer. His marriage to his first wife (who remained with their son in the United States throughout the Second World War) ended in divorce in 1946, and on 8 August 1947 he married Loveday Elizabeth Matthews (<i>b</i>. 1916/17), a widowed secretary and daughter of Evelyn Robins Abbott (1873&#150;1956), civil servant in India and chief commissioner of Delhi from 1924 to 1928. There were no children of this second marriage.<br>
<br>De Manio was transferred from the BBC's Overseas Service to its Home Service in 1950. He managed to survive the furore over his slip of the tongue when he announced a talk by the governor of Nigeria, Sir John Macpherson, &#145;The land of the Niger&#146;, as &#145;The land of the nigger&#146;, and in 1958 he was invited to join the new BBC programme <span class="italic">Today</span>. This was a daily breakfast time magazine programme on the Home Service (renamed Radio 4 in 1967) &#145;bringing you news, views, and interviews&#146;. Despite his inability to give the correct time, de Manio survived as presenter from 1958 until 1971. Although one listener demanded compensation after he had crashed his car in surprise after hearing the wrong time announced on his car radio, most listeners got used to his misreading the studio clock, and his mistakes made him seem more human, a real person. With his relaxed, informal style and his friendly manner he became very popular, regarded by millions of listeners as a personal friend. To the listening public he was the <span class="italic">Today</span> programme, a national institution. In 1969 he was the first radio broadcaster to interview Prince Charles. He was voted radio personality of the year by the Variety Club of Great Britain in 1964, and by the British Radio Industries Club in 1971. But in 1970 the new editor of morning current affairs programmes decided to add a co-presenter, and to make <span class="italic">Today</span> more of a current affairs programme. For a year de Manio was joint presenter with John Timpson. He never felt happy with the new format, feeling that two presenters tended to talk to each other, rather than directly to the listeners.<br>
<br>For the next seven years (1971&#150;8) de Manio presented his own afternoon programme, <span class="italic">Jack de Manio Precisely</span>. He also presented <span class="italic">With Great Pleasure</span> (1971&#150;3). His one venture into television, when he was asked to present <span class="italic">Wednesday Magazine</span>, a women's programme, was not a success. For a short time from 1979 onwards he contributed to <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>, but he did little broadcasting in the 1980s.<br>
<br>De Manio's career and the development of the informal interview marked the end of the old style of impersonal and impartial radio broadcasting. On the air he behaved naturally, and Brian Johnston's advice, when asked how to become a good broadcaster, was &#145;be like Jack de Manio: be yourself&#146;. As a radio broadcaster it was his voice rather than his face which was well known. The slightly hoarse, gravelly tones became instantly recognizable, and despite his foreign antecedents, he was the epitome of the middle-class, middle-brow Englishman, a <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> reader. He died at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London, on 28 October 1988, of cancer of the liver. He was survived by his second wife and the son of his first marriage. A memorial service was held at All Souls, Langham Place, on 18 January 1989.<br>
