<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loughlin, Dame  Anne</span>  (1894&#150;1979), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 28 June 1894 in Leeds, the daughter of Thomas Loughlin, an Irish boot and shoe maker. Her mother died when Anne was twelve, and she subsequently took over the responsibility of looking after her younger brothers and sisters. Four years later, on the death of her father, she began working in a Leeds clothing factory to support the family. She soon became an active trade unionist and by 1915 was a full-time organizer, leading the Hebden Bridge strike of 6000 clothing workers in 1916. In 1920 she became national organizer of what became the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers, charged with rebuilding the union after the First World War when membership was declining drastically.<br>
<br>Anne Loughlin's post involved travel throughout the country, and her task was made difficult by falling wages, rising unemployment, and the hostility of the union men to women members. Union tactics were to hold limited strikes in order to establish union rates and conditions, town by town. It was alleged that when Anne Loughlin appeared in any town, employers immediately called a meeting to plan defensive action. They would be faced by all 5 feet of a severely but stylishly dressed woman with fair hair, innocent blue eyes, and a schoolgirl complexion, who would tell them in an incisive way exactly what she intended to do. She had the knack of inspiring loyalty and confidence among women; her explanations were lucid and she spoke their language. She was elected to the TUC general council in 1929 from the organization's women's group, and was one of those who pressed successfully for the establishment of the national women's advisory committee within the TUC.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Anne Loughlin served on royal commissions and government committees on health and safety, industrial insurance, equal pay, and holidays with pay. She was a member of the Joint Committee of Working Women's Organizations and was also active in the International Labour Organisation and International Federation of Trade Unions. She was appointed OBE in 1935.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Anne Loughlin was frequently consulted by the government. Ernest Bevin, while still minister of labour, appointed her to a board advising on the working conditions and social problems encountered by thousands of women who switched from civilian to munitions industries. She was involved in the organization of clothing prices, utility production, austerity restrictions, and the output of 409 million uniforms and other garments for the armed forces. In recognition of her wartime work she was made a dame of the British empire in 1943.<br>
<br>In 1942, as the longest serving TUC general council member, Anne Loughlin became its chairman and president of the 1943 congress. She was the first woman and first titled person to hold the post. She urged the TUC to plan for a future of social, economic, and industrial change in accordance with its socialist aims. She believed equal pay was the just reward for women's war effort. The post-war concern with exports and the shortage of both cloth and textile workers evoked her scathing criticism of the Dior &#145;new look&#146; in 1947, with its long, full skirts.<br>
<br>Dame Anne Loughlin became general secretary of the Garment Workers' Union in 1948, and the first woman to become a trade group member of the TUC general council. Early in 1950 she served on a wages council (formerly trade boards) for her industry and a development council looking at ways to increase efficiency, productivity, and working conditions in the clothing industry. The final report, presented with recommendations in 1952, was scrapped by the Conservative government of the day.<br>
<br>In 1953 Anne Loughlin retired from her union post on grounds of ill health, probably caused by years of hard work. By then, she was seen as part of the union establishment in contrast to her youthful reputation as a radical firebrand. Nevertheless, her concern throughout her career that women should be treated in the same way as men in the workplace and union, and her service to the clothing industry as a whole, made her fully deserving of the accolade given by the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers when the Anne Loughlin Room was opened at union headquarters in 1975: &#145;An International Women's Year tribute to an outstanding pioneer woman, member and leader&#146;  (&#145;Appreciation&#146;, 1975). Anne Loughlin never married; she died at her home, 147 Trinity Road, Tooting, London, on 14 July 1979.<br>
