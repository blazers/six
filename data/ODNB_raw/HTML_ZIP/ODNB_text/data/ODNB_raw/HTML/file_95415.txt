<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1621&#150;1681), <span class="occ">politician and benefactor</span>, was the sixth son and youngest child of Sir Nicholas Smith (<i>d</i>. 1622) of Larkbeare, Devon, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73528/', "Sir Ralph Horsey")</script> of Clifton Maybank, Dorset [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71919/', "Horsey family")</script>]. He was born into a prosperous west-country merchant family. His grandfather, Sir George Smith, was mayor of Exeter on three occasions, while his father sat as MP for St Mawes in the Addled Parliament of 1614.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of James Smith's life before September 1643, when, aged about twenty-one, he took up arms for Charles I following the royalist capture of Exeter in the civil war. Knighted on 30 July 1644, he continued to serve as a colonel of cavalry until the king's army disbanded at Truro on 13 March 1646. For the next fourteen years he seems to have remained in Devon, an object of intermittent suspicion to the parliamentary regime. On 27 April 1648 he married a Cornish heiress, Bridget, daughter of Sir Reynold Mohun of Boconnoc and widow of John Nicholls of Trewarne. She was dead by 16 September 1663, when Smith was licensed to marry Anne, daughter of John Lucy, a merchant of London and Antwerp, and widow of William Boevey (<i>d</i>. 1661), of Little Chelsea, Middlesex. There were no children of either marriage. Boevey had left Anne an estate consisting of a house with a 3 acre garden in Little Chelsea, which was then a small and remote Thames-side settlement. Its hearth tax return for 1666 recorded only seven houses, of which by far the largest was Smith's, with eighteen hearths. By 1682, however, he had sold the mansion and estate to Charles Morgan.<br>
<br>Smith's political fortunes revived with the restoration of Charles II, when he had the additional advantage of being first cousin to the man who had done most to bring it about, namely General George Monck, created duke of Albemarle in July 1660 immediately after the king's return; Smith bore the great banner at his kinsman's funeral in 1670. In 1661 he was returned to parliament for Exeter, and during the eighteen years of the so-called Cavalier Parliament was appointed to no less than 125 committees. He was conscientious in representing the interests of his constituents, and was one of six MPs sent to the king on 8 April 1662 to request the suspension of the monopoly of the export of cloth enjoyed by the Merchant Adventurers of London, so that the trade could be opened up to (among others) the merchants of Exeter. The petition was granted, and in the following year Smith was appointed to a committee set up to determine what benefits had accrued to the kingdom as a result.<br>
<br>In October 1667 Smith bought an estate at Trehannick in Cornwall, about 3 miles from Camelford, from William Carmynowe, a Cornish gentleman who had also fought for the king during the civil war. But in March 1675 he mortgaged this property for &pound;2900, and thereafter resided at Warmington House, in the centre of Camelford, when he came to Cornwall. In 1679 and 1681 he was elected MP for Camelford. The earl of Shaftesbury regarded him as an opponent of the policy of excluding the Catholic James, duke of York, from the succession, but in fact Smith played little part in either parliament, and missed the crucial division in May 1679 because he was in Cornwall. He was engaged in making provision for the endowment of a school in Camelford. In 1671 he had bought from Hugh Carew of Trevye a messuage and tenement called Great Tregarth, an estate situated to the north-west of the town. Now, on 24 May 1679, he conveyed half of this property in trust to the mayor and burgesses, &#145;in consideration of the goodwill and respect which Sir James Smyth has towards the borough of Camelford&#146;, directing that the rents and revenues be used &#145;for the better erecting of a schoolhouse and the maintenance of a school there&#146;  (Cornwall RO, MS X345/3).<br>
<br>Smith died between 21 and 25 October 1681, of unknown causes, and was buried in Chelsea parish church on 18 November. He had already arranged for the conveyance of his inherited estates to the descendants of his surviving brother, George, who later sold them for &pound;5000. The rest of his property was bequeathed to trustees, who were to sell them in order to pay his debts, legacies, and funeral expenses, and transfer the residue to his widow. In the event, however, Anne, who lived until 1698, inherited only debts amounting to more than &pound;6000, and these gave rise to a series of lawsuits. One such was brought in 1684 by Francis Blight of Bodmin, who claimed &pound;200 which he had allegedly lent to Smith in 1653. Blight won his case, and in 1689 Anne Smith was ordered to repay the money.<br>
<br>The fortunes of Smith's school were no less troubled. Soon after he had set up the trust at Camelford, a grammar school and writing school were established in the town, and educated and respectable clergymen of the Church of England were appointed as salaried masters by the mayor and burgesses. But contrary to Smith's intentions, no schoolhouse was built; pupils received their lessons in the town hall, and after that was demolished, in the homes of the masters. The grammar school was discontinued from around the middle of the eighteenth century because a salary of &pound;10 per annum was insufficient to attract adequate teachers, but the writing school lasted into the early nineteenth century. Smith's endowment funded the writing schoolmaster's annual salary of &pound;5, but the remainder was used to defray the mayor's expenses and to meet other civic costs, for instance the land tax and poor rates. In 1813, however, the corporation's failure to build a schoolhouse led to an information being filed in chancery against the mayor and burgesses of Camelford, alleging wilful misappropriation of the money from Sir James Smith's endowment. The defendants were adamant that no trust money had ever been misapplied or diverted for personal use, and they argued that children had continued to be educated, on the grounds that the writing school had been maintained and suitable masters appointed. Furthermore, they had been unaware both of the real purposes of the charity and of the contents of the deed of 1679, which had been &#145;locked up in the Chest of the Town Clerk and never inspected for a great number of years until April last&#146;  (Cornwall RO, MS X345/8).<br>
<br>In fact even before the information had been laid, a plan of a schoolhouse had been drawn up for the corporation's approval, while a vacant plot of ground had been cleared and approved for its building. The schoolhouse was finally erected in the following year, fulfilling the terms of Smith's endowment some 135 years after he had made it. As more space has been needed for greater numbers of children, so new buildings have been constructed. The school (with over 600 pupils on its roll in 2006) now bears the name Sir James Smith's Community College in memory of the man who first supported education in Camelford.<br>
