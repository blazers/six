<span class="headword">Aspley,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1573, <em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born the son of William Aspley (<i>d</i>. 1574), vicar of Royston, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. after 1640), who outlived her son. On 5 February 1588 he was apprenticed to the London bookseller George Bishop, and was freed on 11 April 1597, by which date he would have been at least twenty-four. His house and shop were in St Paul's Churchyard; he set up first at the sign of the Tiger's Head in 1599 against the north-eastern wall of the cathedral, but by 1608 had moved across the churchyard to larger premises at the sign of the Parrot, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Aspley's fame largely rests on his association with Shakespeare. On 23 August 1600 he and a fellow bookseller, Andrew Wise, entered &#145;Muche a Doo about nothinge&#146; and &#145;the second parte of the history of kinge Henry the IIIJth&#146; into the register of the Stationers' Company; both were printed on their behalf by Valentine Simmes that same year  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 3.170). Aspley's name appears on one of the two variant editions of Shakespeare's sonnets published in 1609. He was one of four booksellers at whose charge the first folio of Shakespeare was printed in 1623; he also co-published the second folio edition of 1632. In addition Aspley published John Marston's <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span> (1604), <span class="italic">Eastward Ho!</span> by Marston, George Chapman, and Ben Jonson (1605), and Chapman's <span class="italic">Bussy D'Ambois</span> (1607&#150;8). However, perhaps his most successful publishing ventures were popular religious works.<br>
<br>Aspley was an active and evidently trusted member of the Stationers' Company; he was made a liveryman in 1611 and frequently arbitrated in disputes between members of the company. Despite a dramatic confrontation with the governing body in August 1628 in his capacity as a stock-keeper for the company, which led to his suspension for six months, he was elected to that same governing body in July 1630. Early the following year he was appointed to a committee to oversee the &#145;workmanshipp&#146; of the almanacs printed on behalf of the company; it is appropriate, or perhaps ironic, that his will is wrapped in a page from Robert Butler's almanac of 1632  (Jackson, 224). He was elected master of the company on 14 July 1640 but died during his term, at some point between 7 and 19 December. His wife and child had predeceased him and he asked to be buried alongside them in the local church of St Faith's. The rights to a number of his religious publications appear as separate items in his will, bequeathed to his nephew William Page and to Robert Lunn, another kinsman. The bookseller Luke Fawne was the executor of the will and its main beneficiary.<br>
