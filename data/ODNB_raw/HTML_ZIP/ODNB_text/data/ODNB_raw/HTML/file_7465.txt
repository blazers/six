<span class="headword">Deluc,  Jean-Andr&eacute;</span>  (1727&#150;1817), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and politician</span>, was born on 8 February 1727 in Geneva, the elder of the two children of Fran&ccedil;ois Deluc, a wealthy watch manufacturer. He was educated by his father, who had published defences of Christianity against Mandeville and other rationalistic writers, and was active in the stormy arena of Genevan politics. Fran&ccedil;ois Deluc had been &#145;one of the most terrible of the [bourgeois] party in our troubles of 1734 and 1737&#146;, complained Charles Bonnet; the &#145;two sons suckled demagogy with their milk and are, with their father, at the head of the party&#146;  (Wolf, 4.194&#150;5). Bonnet's assessment of the Deluc family's political leadership is just, though the implications as to Deluc's character are not. In 1763, after the republic's aristocratic ruling council had burned Rousseau's <span class="italic">Social Contract</span> and banned its author, Deluc was chosen, along with forty-one others, to submit a representation protesting against the act. This inaugurated Geneva's bourgeois revolution. He continued to lead the party of <i>repr&eacute;santants</i> in negotiations with Rousseau and played a key role in difficult and dangerous negotiations with Geneva's guarantor powers, France, Bern, and Z&uuml;rich, and with the aristocratic ruling party. At the eleventh hour these negotiations secured a peaceable solution: a new constitution, the edict of 1768, that granted the bourgeoisie significant powers. A contemporary observed that during the crisis Deluc frequently cooled heated spirits: &#145;always calm in the midst of peril, in the greatest dangers he never lacked expedients, and rendered distinguished service to his fellow citizens&#146;  (G&uuml;r, 170).<br>
<br>A trade embargo imposed by France during the crisis caused the failure of Deluc's business, and in 1773 he emigrated to England, a refuge for liberal bourgeois Genevans. There he secured a post as reader to Queen Charlotte and lived at Windsor. The queen found him &#145;philosophe comme il faut, for &hellip; all his works are full of admiration for the Supreme Being&#146;  (Tunbridge, 18). He was elected FRS in 1773. In the 1790s, as Geneva fell increasingly under threat from France, he received letters requesting his intercession with George III in favour of British intervention; many Genevans hoped for his return. In 1797, under cover of an appointment as honorary professor of natural history and geology to the University of G&ouml;ttingen, he was sent by the British government on a secret mission to enlist the duke of Brunswick's support for the entry of Prussia into a Quadruple Alliance; Deluc also met Frederick William III, king of Prussia. The mission, however, was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>&#145;The elder is made for better things&#146;, Bonnet had urged  (Wolf, 4.194&#150;5). Deluc had acquired early on a taste for natural philosophy. Already at seventeen years of age he began nearly annual explorations of the alps of the Faucigny, at the time an unknown region. His brother, Guillaume Antoine, accompanied him on these journeys and continued to supply him with observations for the duration of his lifetime. His alpine travels led Deluc to the two fields to which he was to make important contributions: meteorology and geology, both terms which he used himself. His mountain observations of fogs and clouds convinced him of the incorrectness of the accepted solution theory of evaporation, according to which evaporating water dissolves into the air. In his <span class="italic">Id&eacute;es sur la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie</span> (2 vols., 1786&#150;7) and in several articles he maintained instead that heat causes evaporation and that water vapour is an expansible fluid (a gas) that fills space independently of the presence of any other gases. This principle was extended to all gases by John Dalton some fifteen years later, to form what was later known as Dalton's law of partial pressures. Long awaited, and regarded as revolutionary by his contemporaries, Deluc's <span class="italic">Recherches sur les modifications de l'atmosph&egrave;re</span> (2 vols., 1772) was the product of his search for a reliable method to measure mountain heights with a barometer. His approach to the problem generated exemplary designs for accurate barometers and thermometers, along with rigorous methods for using them in precise measurement. Deluc also arrived at a clear statement of such principles of instrumentation as comparability among instrument scales, their linearity, and the role of the fixed point.<br>
<br>Deluc published his geological investigations in numerous treatises, articles, and letters, among which the most important are <span class="italic">Lettres &hellip; sur l'histoire de la terre</span> (1779), <span class="italic">Lettres &agrave; Delam&eacute;therie</span> (1790&#150;93), and <span class="italic">Geological Letters, Addressed to Professor Blumenbach</span> (1793&#150;4). His early interest in the subject sprang from a youthful appreciation of the beauties of mountain scenery; later he came to view the earth's history as necessary background for an understanding of the origin, history, and nature of man&#151;which he viewed as a pious Christian of Calvinist origin.<br>
<br>Deluc sought to establish a chronology of the earth's history based on the character of the rock strata and the fossils they contained: &#145;two parallel histories&#146;, as he put it, &#145;that of rock layers and that of organized beings&#146;  (Ellenberger and Gohau, 248). These histories recorded a succession of forms through time, with the more recent fauna being closer to present forms. The way in which these alterations occurred, according to Deluc, was as follows: in the beginning God created a chaotic fluid. From this fluid the successive rock strata precipitated, the precipitate changing as expansible fluids (gases) periodically erupted from the interior of the earth, altering the chemical composition of the original fluid. The fluid's changing composition induced modifications among the fauna as well. Shells and skeletons were deposited in successive strata. The eruptions of gases also deformed previously laid down strata. In this way he bound together fauna, lithology, and orientation of strata.<br>
<br>Deluc recognized the high antiquity of the earth and correlated long epochs, punctuated by eruptions of expansible fluids, with the six days of the account in <span class="roman">Genesis</span>&#151;to the defence of which he devoted himself unremittingly. The six epochs terminated with the deluge, since which time, some 5000&#150;6000 years ago, creative geological processes ceased; the earth was now quiescent, under the operation of &#145;present-day causes&#146;&#151;a term that he coined  (Deluc, &#145;8<sup>e</sup> Lettre&#146;, <span class="italic">Observations sur la physique</span>, 37, 1790, 202&#150;9).<br>
<br>Deluc's religious convictions, his belief that the earth had experienced transformations too great to allow for the operation of present-day causes in the distant past, and his determined opposition to Hutton&#151;whose theory seemed to him not only to threaten Christianity, but also to lack sufficient historical sense&#151;have earned him harsh criticism from historians of geology from Lyell onwards. His great prolixity did not lighten the task of his advocates; Priestley complained that &#145;he could barely comprehend&#146; the <span class="italic">Id&eacute;es sur la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie</span>  (Bickerton, 94). Nor did his vigorous opposition to the new chemistry of Lavoisier help, although his opposition was shared by many British and Germans who associated French chemistry with the French Revolution and its conquests. Two other controversies in which he became embroiled further reduced his credit: with Horace B&eacute;n&eacute;dict de Saussure over the relative merits of their respective hygrometers (Saussure's was superior), and over his claim to be the discoverer of the principle of latent heat. Nevertheless, contemporaries held him in universally high regard. Hutton considered him his most redoubtable adversary, and Cuvier, who borrowed extensively from him, placed him in the first rank among geologists of the late eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Historians of geology began to re-evaluate Deluc's work at the end of the twentieth century. Far from having engaged in baseless speculations, he supported his theories with an immense fund of observations gathered on his extensive travels. His correlation of fossils with rock strata was an important early contribution to the notion of palaeontological dating of strata. His appreciation of the close relation between palaeontological and tectonic changes influenced the later work of Elie de Beaumont and Croizet and Jobert, and he recognized the long-term formation of mountains, requiring successive periods of orogenic activity or, as he put it, &#145;revolution upon revolution&#146;  (Gohau, 227). If he was not first to use the term &#145;geology&#146; in its modern sense, he was one of its earliest advocates. His principal weakness in geology lay in his focus on a grand theory of the earth and his relative lack of interest in the prosaic, methodical description of local strata.<br>
<br>Deluc married twice: the name of his first wife is not known; his second wife, Mary, he married after settling in England. He suffered a painful and lingering illness during the last years of his life, which confined him to his room but did not prevent him from pursuing research in electrochemistry. He developed a galvanic pile, which he called a dry pile but has more often been called the Zamboni pile after its later improver. The pile consisted of a large number of discs of zinc foil and of paper silvered on one side. By eliminating the wet conductor between the two metal conductors he believed he had succeeded in separating the electrical from the chemical aspects of the pile.<br>
<br>Besides works in meteorology and geology Deluc published treatises on a wide range of subjects: a work showing that Bacon's French translator had omitted passages favourable to religion (<span class="italic">Bacon tel qu'il est</span>, 1800); on Christian education (<span class="italic">Lettres sur l'education religieuse de l'enfance</span>, 1799); and an apologetic work, <span class="italic">Lettres sur le christianisme adress&eacute;es &agrave; M. le pasteur Teller</span>, 1801.<br>
<br>Deluc died at Windsor on 7 November 1817 and was buried in the churchyard at Clewer, Somerset. Contemporaries praised the mildness of his character, &#145;the warmth of his feelings, and the habitual gentleness and urbanity of his manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 393). Much loved at court, he was described by Fanny Burney as the queen's philosopher.<br>
