<span class="headword">Bridgeman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Parker]</span>, Dame  Caroline Beatrix</span>, Viscountess Bridgeman  (1873&#150;1961), <span class="occ">political activist and churchwoman</span>, was born on 30 June 1873, the third of five children and eldest daughter of the Hon. Cecil Thomas Parker (1845&#150;1931), son of the sixth earl of Macclesfield and land agent for the duke of Westminster, and his wife, Rosamund Esther Harriet Longley (1843/4&#150;1936), daughter of Charles Thomas Longley, archbishop of Canterbury from 1862 until 1868. Educated privately she worked as a school manager in London's East End and for the Charity Organization Society before marrying <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37223/', "William Clive Bridgeman (1864&#150;1935)")</script> on 30 April 1895. They had three sons (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47921/', "Sir Maurice Richard Bridgeman")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58054/', "Robert Clive Bridgeman")</script>), each of whom went on to distinguished public and private careers, and lived at Leigh Manor, near Minsterley, Shropshire, where she enjoyed landscaping the garden.<br>
<br>Six weeks after marrying, Caroline Bridgeman assisted her husband with his parliamentary campaign for Mid Derbyshire, and although he lost, the campaign launched a durable political partnership. In 1904 Caroline Bridgeman formed one of the country's first women's unionist associations in Oswestry (for which her husband became MP in 1906), and by 1918 it was one of the largest such associations in the country. Nationally she was active with the British women's covenant committee (opposing Irish home rule) and the Women's Unionist Tariff Reform Association. Once women were enfranchised in 1918 the latter became formally affiliated with the Conservative Party as the Women's Unionist Organization (WUO), which Caroline Bridgeman chaired after obtaining a guarantee of control over all non-financial matters. She urged women to be broad-minded and join political parties rather than feminist societies; and the success of parties, particularly the Conservatives, at attracting women members helps somewhat to account for the decline of women's groups in the 1920s. The admiration which she commanded within the party strengthened the WUO's position, and its effectiveness contributed to the party's later success with women voters. She was a good committee worker and eloquent speaker, who laced her speeches with humour, yet was reserved and rarely at ease with individuals. Most of her close friends were men, as women often found her critical nature intimidating, and the tenants at Leigh regarded her with respect rather than affection. An attractive woman, her erect posture made her appear taller than she was, and she had simple tastes, preferring buses to taxis, though she later permitted herself the luxury of one of Britain's first television sets.<br>
<br>Bridgeman's contributions to the Conservative Party were recognized with a DBE in 1924. Later that year, when her husband became first lord of the Admiralty, the attendant spousal duties forced her to resign from the WUO leadership. Yet she was not away from the party for long, and in May 1926 she was elected to a one-year term as chair of the central council of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, making her the first woman to hold such a position in any party. She sought a greater role for women in policy making and in 1927 she introduced the requirement that at least one of the four party conference delegates from each constituency was a woman. Within a few years women formed over one third of all delegates. In 1928, when her husband announced his intention to retire as an MP, there was some suggestion that she should stand in his place. However, she regarded her political role as adjunct to his and simultaneously withdrew from politics. Thirty years later, when the first life peeresses were being selected for nomination to the House of Lords, her name was suggested within the party as a possibility, but by 1958 she was too old to embark on a parliamentary career.<br>
<br>However, Viscountess Bridgeman (as she was styled from 1929, when her husband was created a peer) did have interests outside politics. As the granddaughter of an archbishop (and sister of a bishop of Pretoria, Wilfrid Parker) it was perhaps unsurprising that her non-political energies were devoted to the Church of England. Between 1925 and 1960 she was a member of the house of laity, serving as vice-chair from 1942 until 1947. She believed that the church assembly had to foster directly the nation's spiritual life, and encouraged this with her tireless promotion of religious education and improved clerical pay. The church's survival depended on maintaining a community of believers, she submitted, and this could be accomplished only through religious education, and more particularly by promoting denominational schools. Similarly, increased stipends and pensions for the clergy and their dependants were necessary for sustainable clerical recruitment, and she argued forcefully and successfully for better allowances. These issues demanded the church's highest attention, even if it required short-term economizing on church building and physical improvements. She was the only woman member of the archbishops' commission which sat between 1930 and 1935 to consider the relationship between church and state, following parliament's rejection of the prayer book measure. (Her husband, who shared an ecclesiastical background, had unsuccessfully sponsored the measure in the House of Commons in 1927.)<br>
<br>Church colleagues hoped that Caroline Bridgeman would promote religious broadcasting after her appointment as a BBC governor in 1935 in succession to her husband, who had died that August. During her four years on the board she monitored carefully the progress of religious broadcasts, but warned against making them too sentimental and maintained that the church should concentrate on the medium of print, since broadcasting had only an emotional appeal and could not make as lasting an impact. In addition to this work she chaired the Florence Nightingale Hospital for Gentlewomen for fifteen years and, during the First World War, the Shropshire women's war agriculture committee and the selection committee of London land workers. She also served on the royal commission on London squares in 1927 and was appointed a magistrate in 1934. While she regarded the church as her life's main cause, the path she charted in politics led the way for other women, particularly those who preferred established parties over feminist societies as outlets for public activity. She died on 26 December 1961.<br>
