<span class="headword">Potter,  Thomas Bayley</span>  (1817&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 29 November 1817 at Manchester, the younger son of <a name="cosubject_22620"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Potter</span>  (1774&#150;1845), <span class="occ">merchant and first mayor of Manchester</span>, and his second wife, Esther, the daughter of Thomas Bayley of Booth Hall, Blackley, near Manchester. The Potters originated from Tadcaster, Yorkshire, where Thomas Potter senior had managed his father's farm until 1802, when, endowed with capital of some &pound;7000 from his father, he moved to Manchester to set up a textile warehouse with his brothers William (who soon left the partnership) and <a name="cosubject_22616"></a><span class="headword">Richard Potter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Radical Dick]</span>  (1778&#150;1842)<span class="occ"></span>. Under Thomas's direction, this firm became by repute Manchester's largest mercantile business by the early 1840s, dominating the home trade and gradually moving into the foreign trade.<br>
<br>Both Thomas and Richard also played a leading part in the town's civic affairs, at the centre of the radical dissenting nucleus which contested the power of Manchester's entrenched tory-Anglican &eacute;lite. They took a prominent part in the campaigns for religious equality, free trade, and municipal and parliamentary reform in Manchester, while also helping to found both the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and what became the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner and Times</span>. Richard, who married Mary Seddon on 25 September 1815 and was the grandfather of Beatrice Webb, in particular devoted himself to politics, and having become involved in the attempt to reform the constituency of Wigan in 1830, he was elected as its MP in 1832. In the house he proved a stalwart supporter of civil and religious liberty, free trade, the cotton industry, and national education but resigned on account of ill health in March 1839, before dying at Penzance from a brain tumour on 13 July 1842. Sir Thomas Potter, with Richard Cobden and others, played a leading part in the bitter struggle for the incorporation of Manchester and in 1838 became the first mayor elected under the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> of 1835; he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1840. Despite the growing moderation of his political views, he played a key role in the anti-corn law movement in Manchester, and generously contributed to Anti-Corn Law League funds before his death at Buile Hill, Salford, where he lived, on 20 March 1845. He was buried at Ardwick cemetery, Manchester. His elder son, Sir John Potter (1815&#150;1858), took over many of his civic and business interests, served as mayor in 1848&#150;51, and was knighted on the occasion of Queen Victoria's visit to Manchester in 1851. Sir John Potter's readiness to engage in the outward display of office exposed him to charges of snobbery from some of his former radical allies; his growing separation from the &#145;Manchester school&#146; was accentuated by the Crimean War and culminated in his famously defeating John Bright in the Manchester election of 1857. Ironically, however, Sir John's younger brother Thomas Bayley &#145;Principles&#146; Potter, although at this time a firm supporter of Sir John against &#145;league tyranny&#146;, was later to become Cobden's closest political heir and &#145;the personification of the Manchester School&#146;  (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 8, 1898, 590).<br>
<br>Thomas Bayley Potter was first educated at Mr John's school, George Street, Manchester, before joining several more Mancunian Unitarians at Dr Lant Carpenter's school at Bristol (1827&#150;31). He went on to attend Rugby School (1831&#150;2) and University College, London (1833). He was soon actively engaged in Manchester's radical politics, especially the universal suffrage movement, while also serving his apprenticeship in the family firm. He became its principal partner on the death of his brother in 1858, but he seems increasingly to have depended upon Francis Taylor (1818&#150;1872) for its day-to-day management. Shortly after the latter's death, and in the light of unfavourable business conditions, Potter gave up his part in the firm in favour of his political interests. From the late 1850s Potter had been anxious to heal the breach between himself and the Manchester school, and his vigorous support of the Northern cause in the American Civil War, as president of the Union and Emancipation Society, revived his friendship with Cobden and Bright as well as bringing him to national prominence. He also supported European &#145;friends of liberty&#146; and visited Garibaldi at Caprera (which he had helped to purchase) in 1864. Residual rivalries in Manchester politics deterred him from standing for Salford in 1865, but later that year he succeeded Cobden as MP for Rochdale, a seat he would hold until 1895. Potter, friendly with J. S. Mill, was now a keen &#145;out of doors&#146; advocate of an extensive parliamentary reform bill. Within parliament, while neither orator nor debater, Potter proved a popular and attentive MP, and his girth marked him out (like one of his late twentieth-century Liberal successors at Rochdale, Cyril Smith) as the Commons' &#145;greatest&#146; figure. He was active among the radical advocates of religious equality and land law reform, firmly backed Gladstone's leadership of the party, and in 1886, despite earlier reservations, supported home rule.<br>
<br>Potter's real political influence, however, lay outside the house and above all through the organization of the<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45600', "Cobden Club")</script> , formed in honour of its hero in 1866. Potter, &#145;its author and its soul&#146;  (Bright to Potter, 3 April 1874, Potter letters), envisaged the club as an equivalent political organization to the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. It proved an important focus for Liberal MPs and their political allies, a forcing-house on important policy issues such as land and fiscal reform, on which it published an influential series of weighty tomes. It also funded a notable set of university prizes, designed to stimulate the study of political economy. But above all the club became the bastion for the defence of free trade in Britain, and for its advocacy in Europe, the British empire, and America. Under Potter's energetic guidance, it did much to repel the challenge of fair trade in the late 1870s and 1880s, with its popular propagandist activities aimed especially at the newly enlarged rural electorate in the 1885 general election. Potter's own concern for the state of British agriculture was a constant thread in his political career. The club's most obvious public profile came through its regular political dinners, which provided the opportunity for morale-boosting speeches and for the cultivation of international links. But such &#145;mere annual orgie[s]&#146;  (Mallet to Morier, 16 Jan 1866[7], Morier MSS, Oxford, Balliol College) also provided the opportunity for poking fun at Potter, the florid-faced gourmand hoping to win the world to free trade through its stomach. Potter also proved an indefatigable (if often illegible) correspondent, and kept up a wide array of contacts and occasionally exerted some influence on government policy. He travelled extensively in Europe, especially in France and Italy, and in 1879 visited the United States, although his and the Cobden Club's advocacy of free trade proved largely counter-productive in the face of a growing Anglophobic economic nationalism.<br>
<br>Potter remained the linchpin of the Cobden Club until his death, but the club's later years were marked by growing intellectual and policy rifts, especially between the individualistic free-traders such as Sir Louis Mallet and Potter's more pragmatic and radical associates. The club's dinners were less frequent by the late 1880s, but on issues such as the sugar bounties it still achieved considerable public prominence. Potter himself, while often derided, held the club together in a way a less single-minded and more subtle politician might not have done. Suitably in 1890 the club honoured him with a commemorative address presented by Gladstone, who had been a keen supporter of the club's work.<br>
<br>In February 1846 Potter had married Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1820), the daughter of Samuel Ashton, cotton master, of Pole Bank, Gee Cross, Hyde, Cheshire, and the brother of Thomas Ashton, memories of whose murder at the time of a strike in 1831, the family resentfully felt, had been deliberately revived in Mrs Gaskell's <span class="italic">Mary Barton</span> (1847). The lives of their children proved largely unremarkable, although one of the four sons journeyed to the north pole. Believing that &#145;Manchester was no place for a man out of business&#146;  (Potter to Carnarvon, 15 Jan 1877, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/6/21), Potter moved to London. He sold the family home at Buile Hill, Pendleton (an impressive Greek revival villa built for his father by Sir Charles Barry in 1828, and later home of the Salford School of Mining), having already disposed of his Scottish hunting-lodge at Pitnacree, where between 1862 and 1874 he had entertained Cobden, Bright, and other political friends. Following Mary's death at Cannes in 1885, Potter married on 10 March 1887 Helena, the daughter of John Hick, of Bodmin, Cornwall. They later combined living in London with a rural retreat, The Hurst, Midhurst (close to Cobden's old Sussex home), where Potter died on 6 November 1898, following a paralytic stroke the previous June. He was buried at Heyshott parish church on 10 November, his wish to rest near Cobden at West Lavington having been refused by its vicar. His second wife survived him.<br>
