<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armour,  James Brown</span>  (1841&#150;1928), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span>, was born on 20 January 1841 in the townland of Lisboy, near Ballymoney, co. Antrim, the youngest of the six children of William Armour (1795?&#150;1864), farmer, and his wife, Jane Brown, daughter of William Brown of Ballynaloob, near Ballymoney, co. Antrim. He was born into a strongly Presbyterian farming community, attended Kilraughts Presbyterian Church, and received his early education at the nearby Ganaby School. His education continued at Ballymoney model school and the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He entered the Queen's College, Belfast, in 1860 and completed his undergraduate degree course at the Queen's College, Cork, where he graduated with a BA general degree in 1864; in 1866 he was awarded the degree of MA, with second class honours, at the Queen's College, Belfast.<br>
<br>After some initial hesitation, Armour decided to become a Presbyterian minister and was ordained on 19 July 1869 by the Route presbytery, as assistant and successor to J. L. Rentoul of Second or Trinity Presbyterian Church, Ballymoney. Known as &#145;the black wolf&#146;, the young Armour had black hair and sharp features, wore spectacles, and invariably sported a beard. A later portrait by William Conor shows him to have become white-haired, with the gold-rimmed spectacles and beard still in evidence. Armour was in some respects a man of generous and liberal instincts but he also had a considerable temper and frequently used quite violent language to denounce political opponents. While he was an advocate of generous treatment of Irish Roman Catholic demands for denominational educational provision, for example at university level, he was extremely hostile towards the Anglican church in Ireland, with regard not only to its doctrines and its clergy, but above all, as he believed, because of its role as part of the conservative landlord ascendancy. In particular he constantly stressed the sufferings of Presbyterians at the hands of the Church of Ireland. Although theologically orthodox, he could best be described as something of a natural nonconformist in other matters.<br>
<br>Armour did not marry until he reached the age of forty-two. His bride, whom he married on 19 March 1883, was a widow, Jennie Adams Stavely Hamilton (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stavely). She already had two sons by a previous marriage to her cousin A. M. S. Hamilton, and was to have three sons with Armour&#151;Max, William, and Kenneth. The Armour family lived in the manse adjoining the church.<br>
<br>Armour was to remain in Ballymoney for the rest of his life, retiring as minister of the Trinity congregation on 2 September 1925. He was actively involved in the fields of temperance and education, acting as the first principal of Ballymoney intermediate school, teaching classics on a part-time basis at Magee College, Londonderry, until 1908 and serving on the first senate of the newly established Queen's University of Belfast (1910&#150;14). He enjoyed a brief period of official favour after 1906, when he was appointed as one of the personal chaplains to the new viceroy, Lord Aberdeen.<br>
<br>However, it was Armour's political activities which made him a well-known figure in the north of Ireland and beyond. His views were expressed at the local level in north Antrim through his involvement in election campaigns and also on the wider stage of the annual general assemblies of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, for example in 1893 and again in 1913. These views were given considerable press coverage and he contributed a chapter entitled &#145;A Presbyterian view&#146; to J. H. Morgan, ed., <span class="italic">The New Irish Constitution</span> (1912). Prior to the introduction of Gladstone's <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> in 1886, Armour was an enthusiastic supporter of the Liberal cause, as were considerable numbers of Ulster Presbyterians. His support for land reform and the aggressive character of his Presbyterianism were important factors influencing Armour's political outlook. For him, Conservatism was closely linked to the Anglican church and the landlord class.<br>
<br>Following the split in the Liberal Party over home rule in 1886 Armour at first favoured the Liberal Unionist position. However, he became increasingly unhappy, principally because of the allegedly unfair treatment of Liberal Unionists by their Conservative Unionist allies, especially with regard to the selection of parliamentary candidates. Indeed, he continued to complain of discrimination against Presbyterians in the whole area of public appointments. From the 1892 election campaign onwards he was to be publicly identified as a supporter of home rule, perhaps more for negative than positive reasons. Inevitably, this commitment exposed him to considerable public and private criticism over the years.<br>
<br>Armour was not a nationalist in the Irish Ireland sense, hence his hostility to cultural nationalism, the Sinn F&eacute;in movement, and the Easter rising. Like John Redmond, he conceived of home rule as a means of strengthening rather than weakening the bonds between Ireland and Britain. Thus Armour gave his patriotic support to Ireland's participation in the First World War. He saw home rule as a force for reconciliation, undoing &#145;the evils of the paper union of 1800&#146;. He believed it would stimulate Ireland's commerce and trade, but he also justified it on the grounds that it was the principle of Presbyterian church government applied to secular affairs. Home rule would benefit protestantism generally by ending the political monopoly of Anglicanism. As far as Presbyterians were concerned, the vital consideration was that they &#145;cannot possibly under home rule have a lesser share in the offices of emolument and dignity than they had all down the years from 1800 to 1912&#146;  (Armour, &#145;A Presbyterian view&#146;).<br>
<br>When partition became a reality in 1920, Armour condemned it in principle but also because he saw the new government of Northern Ireland as anti-Presbyterian. He caught a chill at a luncheon given in honour of the Unionist prime minister Sir James Craig in 1928. This subsequently developed into pneumonia and his death followed at the Trinity manse, Ballymoney, on 25 January 1928. He was buried on 28 January in Ballymoney cemetery. His widow survived him until 1931.<br>
