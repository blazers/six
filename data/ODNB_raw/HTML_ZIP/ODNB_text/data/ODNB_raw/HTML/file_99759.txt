<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perkins,  Geoffrey Howard</span>  (1953&#150;2008), <span class="occ">comedy writer and radio and television producer</span>, was born on 22 February 1953 at the maternity hospital in Bushey, Hertfordshire, the son of Wilfrid John Perkins, electronic engineer, and his wife, Peggy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Patterson, of 1 Manor House Cottages, Elm Park, Stanmore, Middlesex. He first revealed his talent for comedy in the sixth form at Harrow County School for Boys, a grammar school that boasted a particularly gifted year. In his class were Michael Portillo, who became a Conservative cabinet minister, Nigel Sheinwald, who became the UK's ambassador to Washington, Francis Matthews, who became a theatre director under the stage name Matthew Francis, and the future television presenter Clive Anderson, with whom Perkins produced the school's Christmas revue <span class="italic">Happy Poison</span>. Perkins won an exhibition to read English at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he joined the Oxford Theatre Group Revue as a writer and director. When he left university his career took a somewhat aberrant turn when he and Portillo, on the advice of the university careers service, took jobs at a Liverpool commercial shipping company, Ocean Transport and Trading. So disruptive were Perkins's continual anarchic comic interjections that a corner of the open-plan office was boxed off to contain him.<br>
<br>A year later, in 1976, Perkins returned to London to join BBC Radio light entertainment. His potential was immediately evident to his radio trainers. During a quiz programme he devised during training, a long pause was followed by the presenter saying, &#145;This is a question in two parts. Was this pause by Harold Pinter or Samuel Becket? And the second part is, which line of dialogue preceded it?&#146;  (private information, B. Maxwell). Over the next six years he produced more than twenty different programmes and 200 individual shows. He managed to cajole the famously procrastinating Douglas Adams into completing the scripts for <span class="italic">The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span> (1978 and 1980), turning it into a cult classic. He made creative use of the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop in devising unusual sounds for actors playing aliens. At this time he met his future wife, Lisa Charlotte Braun (<i>b</i>. 1951), a studio manager on the series, and daughter of Rudolph Herbert Braun, accountant. They married on 18 January 1986. Their first-born, Jack, died a cot death. They had two more children, Charlotte and Arthur.<br>
<br>Perkins co-wrote with Angus Deayton the popular <span class="italic">Radio Active</span> series (1981&#150;7), a spoof on local radio. It was later turned into television, as <span class="italic">KYTV</span> (1990&#150;93), for once putting him in front of the camera as the character Mike Flex. The series won the silver rose of Montreux in 1992. Meanwhile, after a brief stint with Thames TV, Perkins had in 1988 co-founded Hat Trick Productions, whose successes included <span class="italic">Drop the Dead Donkey</span> (1990&#150;98), <span class="italic">Father Ted</span> (1995&#150;8), and <span class="italic">Have I Got News for You</span> (1990&#150;). By now he had acquired a reputation as a brilliant script editor with a meticulous line-by-line approach, and had developed an acute sense of what was or could be made funny. For <span class="italic">Father Ted</span>, for example, he persuaded the writers to transform their draft mock documentary into a highly successful sitcom.<br>
<br>In 1995 Perkins was appointed head of comedy at BBC Television to bolster a department criticized for its stale sitcoms. The job enabled him to work with performers and writers who had previously been unavailable to him and he introduced a new generation of edgier, more irreverent series to the corporation's output. Perkins described himself as a &#145;nurturer&#146; of comedies and comic dramas. He was well aware that past classics like <span class="italic">Fawlty Towers</span>, <span class="italic">Only Fools and Horses</span>, and <span class="italic">One Foot in the Grave</span> had taken time to be accepted, so he was prepared to stay loyal to shows that didn't make an immediate impact. He was responsible for such popular fare as the <span class="italic">Harry Enfield</span> programmes, <span class="italic">The Fast Show</span>, <span class="italic">The Thin Blue Line</span>, and <span class="italic">My Family</span>. He nurtured performers too, particularly emerging talent like Catherine Tate and Harry Enfield, giving them the confidence to realize their potential. He kept traditionalists happy by continuing such stalwarts as <span class="italic">Last of the Summer Wine</span>, while ensuring that the scripts remained fresh. He made the occasional error of judgement. He was lukewarm about <span class="italic">The Royle Family</span>, a sitcom about a northern working-class family of couch potatoes. But the views of the writers Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash prevailed and the series, launched in 1998, became very popular.<br>
<br>For his outstanding contribution to the industry Perkins was made a fellow of the Royal Television Society in 1999. In 2001 he left the BBC to become an executive producer with Tiger Aspect Productions. In an interview with <span class="italic">The Independent</span> in October that year he criticized the BBC's director-general John Birt for hindering the creative process through an obsession with budgets and bureaucracy. His Midas touch continued at Tiger Aspect with such series as <span class="italic">Gimme Gimme Gimme</span> (1999&#150;2001), <span class="italic">The Catherine Tate Show</span> (2004&#150;6), and another series teaming up Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse called simply <span class="italic">Harry and Paul</span>. On 29 August 2008, only days before this series was broadcast, he suffered a heart attack before falling under a lorry in London's Marylebone High Street (it was at first thought he had died in a road accident). He was survived by his wife, Lisa, and his children, Charlotte and Arthur.<br>
