<span class="headword">Porter,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1599), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, is known to literary history as the author of a single play, <span class="italic">The Pleasant History of the Two Angry Women of Abington</span> (1599). The play was, the title-page states, &#145;lately played by the right Honorable the Earle of Nottingham, Lord high Admirall, his servants&#146;, and it may be assumed that it was performed at the Rose playhouse on the Bankside. The date of composition is not known. There is no record of it in the account book or &#145;Diary&#146; of Philip Henslowe, the financier of the Admiral's Company. It may be argued therefore that it belongs to a date before 1597 when Henslowe started the practice of recording his payments for plays the company was to perform, or (as often suggested) it may be present in the diary under another name. Certainly it must have existed before 22 December 1598 when &pound;6 were paid for a play called &#145;The 2 Parte of the 2 Angrey Wemen of Abengton&#146;. Porter also received 40<i>s</i>. &#145;in earneste of his boocke called ii mery wemen of abenton&#146; on 28 February 1599; but it is not clear if this refers to yet another play in the Abington sequence or is simply a specimen of Henslowe's disregard for lexical consistency.<br>
<br>Porter's name appears ten times in Henslowe's diary, between 16 December 1596 and 26 May 1599, and this provides the titles of plays he wrote in that period. On 30 August 1598 Henslowe paid Porter and Thomas Downton (a manager of the company) &pound;4 for &#145;Love Prevented&#146;; on the 18th of the same month he lent the company &pound;6 to buy a play by Porter, Chettle, and Jonson called &#145;Hot Anger Soon Cold&#146;; on 4 March 1598 he paid 10<i>s</i>., and on 22 March another &pound;6 10<i>s</i>., for &#145;The Spencers&#146;, written by Porter and Chettle. The references in the diary also trace an increasing exasperation with Porter's requests for unsecured loans and unfulfilled promises of repayment. They provide evidence that in collaborative work (usual with Henslowe's dramatists) he was equally unreliable. On 26 June 1598 Porter and Chettle were paid 20<i>s</i>. to write a play called &#145;The Second Part of Black Batman of the North&#146;, but not before Porter &#145;hath geven me his worde for the performance of the same and all so for my money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henslowe's Diary</span>, 92).<br>
<br>The title-page of his one surviving play calls Porter &#145;Gentleman&#146;, and for all his unreliability he appears in the record as a person of considerable presence, prized by the actors as a valuable property: the company seems to have started rehearsal of &#145;The Second Part of the Two Angry Women&#146; before the script was finished. On 28 February 1599 the managers of the company persuaded Henslowe to lend Porter 40<i>s</i>. in return for &#145;his faythfulle promysse that [they] shold have alle the boockes which he writte ether him sellfe or with any other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henslowe's Diary</span>, 105). Certainly the extant play is a highly professional and successful piece of theatre, lucidly organized at the various interlocking levels of the plot, and justifying the appearance of Porter in the list of &#145;the best for comedy amongst us&#146;, in Francis Meres's <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> of 1598. The location of the action of <span class="italic">Two Angry Women</span> indicates a familiarity with the area around Oxford. A classical sense of play construction accompanied by considerable verbal facility further supports the idea that he had been a student in Oxford University (he calls himself &#145;a poor scholar&#146; in the prologue). Would-be biographers have, however, combed the university archives and have turned up many Henry Porters, but none with any probability of being the dramatist.<br>
<br>It is only at the end of Porter's life that any specific biographical evidence can be found. On 6 June 1599 (only eleven days after his last loan from Henslowe) the Southwark assizes reported a charge against &#145;John Day yeoman&#146; that he &#145;made an assault [with a rapier] upon a certain Henry Porter &hellip; giving to the same Henry Porter a mortal wound on the left breast&#146;, so that he died on the following day. John Day was almost certainly another member of Henslowe's team of writers, first appearing in the diary in 1598, when he was twenty-four years of age (having been sent down from Cambridge in 1593 for stealing a book). The quarrel thus appears to have been between fellow dramatists and fellow dependants on Henslowe. In spite of Day's confession of guilt, the grand jury reduced the charge to manslaughter, finding that Porter had been the aggressor.<br>
