<span class="headword">Conybeare,  William Daniel</span>  (1787&#150;1857), <span class="occ">geologist and dean of Llandaff</span>, was born at St Botolph's rectory, Bishopsgate, London, on 7 June 1787, younger son of the rector, William Conybeare (1739&#150;1815), and his wife, Margaret Hester Olivier (1764&#150;1806). His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6128/', "John Josias Conybeare (1779&#150;1824)")</script>. From 1802 to 1803 he attended Westminster School and he entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1805, graduating BA in 1808 (first class in classics, second in mathematics), and MA in 1811.<br>
<br>Conybeare had been introduced to fossil hunting at his parents' Bexley summer home, and Stukeley's <span class="italic">Itinerarium curiosum</span> (1776) was another early inspiration. By 1809 he &#145;was prepared at once to seize the general fact of the successive distribution&#146; of fossils in rocks &#145;when first laid down as an admitted fact in &hellip; geology&#146;  (W. D. Conybeare, 137). He visited many southern English counties between 1807 and 1812 to compile geological maps, was elected member of the Geological Society of London in 1811, and was much involved with the new Oxford Geology Club&#151;also established in 1811. In 1813 he studied Northern Ireland with William Buckland; they convinced themselves, and soon others, that basalt here was volcanic in origin. Conybeare was also much involved with the Geological Society's map, published in 1820.<br>
<br>Conybeare had been ordained deacon in 1813 and on 23 August 1814 married Sarah Anne (1790/91&#150;1864), daughter of Captain Charles Ranken or Rankin of the East India Company, of co. Down, Ireland; the Conybeares had six children, the eldest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6130/', "William John Conybeare")</script>, Church of England clergyman and author. Once married he had to leave Oxford; he settled as curate in Suffolk. In 1815 Conybeare's father died. His father had &#145;received, for thirty to forty years, an annual income of not less than &pound;3500 from ecclesiastical preferments alone&#146;  (H. C. A. Conybeare, pt 3, 47), so his death meant that Conybeare was to have few financial worries for the remainder of his life. The following year he went on an important continental tour, with Buckland and Greenough, to gain &#145;a general view of the Formations of the Continent &hellip; to identify them with those of England and to ascertain to what extent the science had been cultivated abroad&#146;  (Torrens, &#145;Geology&#146;) during the Napoleonic wars.<br>
<br>In 1817 Conybeare took up a new curacy at Chalcombe near Banbury, but the following year moved as a priest to Cropredy. In August 1819 he was appointed lecturer to St Luke's, Brislington, Bristol, and he was elected FRS that December. With Henry De la Beche, whom he had met at the Oxford club's Clifton meeting in 1818, he started work on the extinct marine reptiles <i>Ichthyosaurus</i> and <i>Plesiosaurus</i> (Conybeare's newly recognized genus). The two men helped inaugurate the Bristol Literary and Philosophical Institution in 1820 and also its associated society. Conybeare was encouraged by now living next to one of the earliest collectors of liassic reptiles, G. W. Braikenridge (1775&#150;1856). This work culminated in three important papers by Conybeare, published between 1821 and 1824. About this time he also undertook a detailed survey of south-west coalfields with William Buckland&#151;work published in 1824. During the survey, in 1820, he gave field tuition to Adam Sedgwick.<br>
<br>Conybeare's most important work, with William Phillips, was <span class="italic">Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales, Part One</span> (ultimately the only part published), which appeared in June 1822. Conybeare extended and vastly improved Phillips's earlier attempts of 1816&#150;18. The book stratigraphically surveyed all rocks down to the Old Red Sandstone. It also contained full catalogues of the fossils found in each formation, and first named the Carboniferous. It became Roderick Murchison's &#145;scientific bible&#146;  (Geikie, 1.126) and Whewell called it &#145;an event far more important than it might at first appear&#146;, because of &#145;the vast impulse which it gave to the study of sound descriptive geology &hellip; felt and acknowledged in other countries as well as in Britain&#146;  (Whewell, 429). This book and the geological maps of Smith (1815) and Greenough (1820) inspired French visitors to England in 1823 to learn how to prepare an equivalent map and memoir for France. The German Karl von Zittel called the book &#145;classic&#146; and confirmed how the methods it had adopted &#145;signified the scientific recognition and marked success of William Smith's reform&#146;  (Zittel, 426).<br>
<br>In January 1823 Conybeare started publication of a &#145;Memoir illustrative of a general geological map of the principal mountain chains of Europe&#146;, with a coloured map in the <span class="italic">Annals of Philosophy</span>. Only six parts appeared, the last in September 1823, because this work had caused a serious breach with G. B. Greenough, president of the Geological Society of London (1807&#150;13, 1818&#150;20, and 1833&#150;5), by June 1823. Greenough felt his plans for a similar map should have had priority. As a result, both projects were abandoned, Conybeare's half-finished. The death of Conybeare's only brother in June 1824 also affected him deeply and he published nothing further on geology between 1824 and 1829.<br>
<br>In 1822 Conybeare had been appointed rector of Sully, Glamorgan, and in 1827 he left Brislington to live there. Late in that year he was elected corresponding member of the Institut de France, for his reptilian studies and stratigraphic work. William Phillips died in April 1828 and Conybeare now hoped to complete his <span class="italic">Outlines</span>, by collaborating with Adam Sedgwick of Cambridge. However, a serious carriage accident in October 1829, which resulted in Conybeare's being badly concussed, helped put paid to this. Conybeare was elected an honorary MA of Cambridge University in 1831 and at the Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1832 he read an important &#145;Report on the progress &hellip; of geology&#146; to the first geology section. Conybeare was by now the leading diluvialist theoretician in England and led opposition to Lyell's <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span> in the 1830s, although Lyell could now note with justice that Conybeare &#145;promises but does not perform&#146;  (Wilson, 273).<br>
<br>In April 1836 Conybeare presented himself to the family rectory of Axminster and moved to Devon. He was thus on hand in 1839 and 1840 to make his last significant geological observations, on the Lyme Regis landslip. With William Dawson and Professor and Mrs Buckland he issued <span class="italic">Ten Plates</span> describing the landslip in 1840, but the 1830s had seen him busiest on theological matters, preaching the Oxford Bampton lectures in 1839. In the 1840s Conybeare abandoned his geology, though he received the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society in 1844. He remained at Axminster until a final move to Llandaff in 1848, where, having become dean in 1845, he was much involved in restoring the cathedral. He died on 12 August 1857 at the rectory, Itchenstoke, Hampshire. Conybeare had been the &#145;most impressive intellectually&#146;  (Rupke, 10) of the early Oxford school of geologists, but his reputation has since suffered because of the loss of his archives.<br>
