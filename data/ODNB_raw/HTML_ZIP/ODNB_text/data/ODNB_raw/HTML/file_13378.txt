<span class="headword">Hoadly,  Samuel</span>  (1643&#150;1705), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was the son of John Hoadly (1617&#150;1668), a clergyman, and his wife, Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1625, <i>d</i>. 1693), widow of one Bushnel; the couple had met aboard the ship which was taking them to New England in April 1639, refugees both from the Laudian persecution. Samuel, their first child, was born at Guilford, Connecticut, on 30 September 1643. The family returned to Britain in October 1653, and in the following June, John Hoadly went to Edinburgh as chaplain to the castle garrison. Samuel had his schooling in the city, and at Michaelmas 1659 entered King James's College there. In July 1662 the Hoadlys moved to Rolveden, Kent. In January 1663 Samuel began teaching at the neighbouring school of Cranbrook. On 19 June 1666 he married Mary Wood, a widow, who died giving birth to a stillborn child on 25 November 1668. Hoadly married again on 29 September 1669; his second wife was Martha (<i>b</i>. 1639), daughter of the puritan divine Benjamin Pickering, with whom he had nine children.<br>
<br>Hoadly set up a private school at Westerham, Kent, where his brother John helped him. In 1678 he moved to Tottenham High Cross, Middlesex, and in May 1686 to Brooke House, Hackney. In April 1700 he was appointed headmaster of Norwich School, where he is now remembered only as father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13375/', "Bishop Benjamin Hoadly")</script>, although in his day he was celebrated as an educationist and writer of textbooks. His <span class="italic">Natural Method of Teaching</span> (1688) went through many editions, and he also produced an edition of Phaedrus and worked on a Latin dictionary. Several of his letters to the eminent Dutch Latinist Johann Georg Graevius are printed in Bishop Hoadly's <span class="italic">Works</span>. Hoadly was in orders, but never beneficed. He died on 17 April 1705 and was buried in St Luke's Chapel, Norwich Cathedral, alongside his second wife (who had died on 13 January 1703). Of their children besides Benjamin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13376/', "John Hoadly (1678&#150;1746)")</script> also attained eminence in the church, Frances married one Hawkins, a dancing-master at the Hackney School, and Sarah married the well-known London bookseller Timothy Childe.<br>
