<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wesley,  Samuel Sebastian</span>  (1810&#150;1876), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 14 August 1810, probably at 11 Adam's Row, Hampstead Road, London, the eldest of the seven surviving children of an irregular union between the organist and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29072/', "Samuel Wesley (1766&#150;1837)")</script> and his housemaid, Sarah Suter (1793/4&#150;1863). He was named after his father's musical idol, Johann Sebastian Bach. His earliest years were passed under the shadow of extreme family disapproval of his parents' liaison. They were also clouded by his father's constant shortage of money (due in large part to the substantial maintenance payments he was required to pay to his estranged wife) and, from 1816, his father's descent into a prolonged bout of severe depression. Acceptance as a child (chorister) of the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, in November 1817 provided an escape from the poverty-stricken household and also marked the beginning of his formal musical education. Later declared by William Hawes, the master of the children, to have been the &#145;best boy he had ever had&#146;, Wesley was among those regularly chosen to join the small group who travelled to sing at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, when the king (George IV) was in residence. Here he was a fellow performer with Rossini at one Saturday evening concert and was also presented with a gold watch by the king.<h2>
<a name="Earlymusicalcareer"></a>Early musical career</h2>Shortly after leaving the choir in 1826 Wesley was appointed organist of St James's Chapel, Hampstead Road, London, and during the next six years he held similar appointments at St Giles, Camberwell (1829&#150;32), St John's, Waterloo Road (1829&#150;31), and Hampton parish church (1831&#150;2). By now he was becoming known as an organist&#151;and particularly as a pedal player&#151;and was one of the first in England to give a solo performance of one of J. S. Bach's organ fugues when he played the &#145;St Ann&#146; at a trial for the post of organist at St Stephen's, Coleman Street, in November 1827. He had also continued his association with Hawes and the latter's multifarious musical activities; he acted as pianist and &#145;conductor of the chorus&#146; at the English Opera House (<i>c</i>.1828&#150;32) and as organist at the Lenten oratorio concerts (1830&#150;32). At the former he was responsible for the overture and &#145;melo-dramatick&#146; music for <span class="italic">The Dilosk Gatherer</span>, a melodrama by Edward Fitzball produced in July 1832, while his setting of the <span class="roman">Benedictus</span> had been given at the latter on 30 March 1832. By now he had also begun to make his mark as a composer of songs and piano and organ music (including a virtuoso set of <span class="italic">Variations on God Save the King</span>, 1829), and looked to be destined for a promising career in the capital. On 10 July 1832, however, he was elected to the post of organist at Hereford Cathedral (whose recently appointed dean, John Merewether, had formerly been incumbent at Hampton) and shortly thereafter he left London, never to return.<h2>
<a name="HerefordandExetercathedrals"></a>Hereford and Exeter cathedrals</h2>Notwithstanding his stated wish to be able to devote himself to the composition of church music, the move was one Wesley was to regret ever afterwards:<blockquote>Painful and dangerous is the position of a young musician who, after acquiring great knowledge of his art in the Metropolis, joins a Country Cathedral. At first he can scarcely believe that the mass of error and inferiority in which he has to participate is habitual and irremediable. (Wesley, <span class="italic">Cathedral Music</span>, 11)</blockquote>Yet the change of circumstances had a remarkable effect on his development as a composer, and resulted in his early masterpiece, the anthem &#145;The Wilderness&#146;, written to commemorate the opening of the rebuilt cathedral organ and first performed on 10 November 1832. Clearly benefiting from its composer's experience in the theatre and concert hall, it remains a remarkable achievement when viewed against the moribund background of contemporary cathedral music. Its up-to-date idiom, however, was not sufficiently of the church to satisfy the three judges for the Gresham prize medal for which Wesley submitted it in 1833, one of whom (R. J. S. Stevens) dismissed it as &#145;a clever thing, but not Cathedral Music&#146;. With this disappointment, and Wesley's failure earlier in the year to achieve more than a run-through of an overture by the Philharmonic Society, came the realization that for a young and little-known composer from the provinces to achieve success in London was a near impossible task. The award of prize medals for his glees &#145;I wish to tune my quiv'ring lyre&#146; (1833) and &#145;At that Dread Hour&#146; (1834) by the Gentlemen's Glee Club, Manchester, offered some recompense, as did the opportunity to perform his overture in E, <span class="roman">Sanctus</span>, and sacred song &#145;Abraham's Offering&#146; at the Hereford festival in 1834. But nothing could compensate for Hereford's position as a musical backwater and this, frustration with the low musical standards at the cathedral, and his pitifully small salary (&pound;60 per annum) led Wesley to apply for the post of organist and sub-chanter at Exeter Cathedral, to which he was appointed on 15 August 1835. His marriage three months earlier (on 4 May) to Mary Anne, the sister of Dean Merewether&#151;presumably without family approval, as it was by special licence and took place in the nearby village of Ewyas Harold&#151;doubtless provided a further reason to move.<br>
<br>While at Hereford Wesley had completed another of his best-known anthems, &#145;Blessed be the God and Father&#146; (1834/1835), and it was during his early years at Exeter that he consolidated his position as the foremost and most innovative composer of church music of his generation. Especially notable are the three outstanding large-scale anthems &#145;O Lord, thou art my God&#146;, &#145;Let us lift up our heart&#146;, and &#145;To my Request and Earnest Cry&#146; (all written <i>c</i>.1836) and that deeply felt miniature &#145;Wash me throughly from my wickedness&#146; (<i>c</i>.1840). All reflect both Wesley's complete command of a highly coloured and emotionally charged harmonic idiom of great individuality and his consummate handling of contrapuntal writing, yet only one, &#145;O Lord, thou art my God&#146;, received even a single performance at the cathedral. Bearing in mind Wesley's later&#151;apparently autobiographical&#151;comment about cathedrals which &#145;would not go to the expense of copying the parts out for the Choir&#146;, one can make assumptions concerning the fate of these works. Certainly the amicable working relationship Wesley had initially enjoyed with the dean and chapter quickly soured after the elevation of the precentor, Thomas Hill Lowe, to the deanery in 1839. For the remainder of his time in the city he was almost constantly at loggerheads with his clerical superiors. It was this, more than anything else, which convinced him that he should qualify himself for an alternative career as a university professor of music. To this end he matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 3 June 1839 and took the degrees of BMus and DMus by accumulation on 21 June; his exercise, &#145;O Lord, thou art my God&#146;, was performed in Magdalen Chapel on 20 June. Thus equipped, Wesley was a candidate for the Reid chair of music in the University of Edinburgh in 1841, but was defeated by Henry Bishop. Well before the result was known, however, another opportunity to escape from Exeter had arisen: having played at the opening of the organ in the newly built parish church in Leeds on 18 October, Wesley was (according to his pupil William Spark) &#145;so much impressed with the wealth of Leeds &hellip; that bearing in mind his disagreement with Dean Lowe &hellip; he forthwith accepted the offer of organist at &pound;200 per annum, guaranteed for ten years&#146;  (Spark, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 166). With only one daily service and no troublesome dean and chapter with whom to deal, it was an offer he could hardly refuse.<br>
<br>Although Wesley was ultimately desperate to move away, his early years in Exeter had been among his happiest, with the birth of two sons&#151;John Sebastian (<i>b</i>. 17 June 1836) and Samuel Annesley (<i>b</i>. 28 Dec 1837)&#151;and extensive participation in local music-making. Warmly welcomed on his arrival by the members of the Devon Madrigal Society (whose monthly meetings he regularly chaired), he also organized a series of subscription concerts for the 1836&#150;7 season and attempted to form an orchestral society in 1837 and a choral society a year later. But none of these initiatives was particularly successful, and from thenceforth&#151;with the exception of the birth of another son, Francis Gwynne, on 29 January 1841&#151;he was dogged by misfortune: the death of his two-month-old daughter Mary in February 1840, the destruction by fire of the plates for a collection of anthems in October 1840, and continuing disputes about his attendance and conduct at the cathedral, particularly a notorious unprovoked attack on two choristers in the cathedral song school in September 1840. He received a series of reprimands: had he not chosen to leave of his own accord he could well have suffered the ignominy of being forced to resign. Even his final departure was marred by controversy, as he unilaterally chose to leave Spark to serve out his notice by proxy. This, and subsequent wrangling over money he claimed was owed to him, reveal a less attractive side to his nature; indeed, Wesley was described by the chapter clerk (with whom he had frequently crossed swords) as &#145;the most to be avoided man I ever met with&#146;  (Exeter Cathedral Archives, MS D &amp; C Exeter/7061/Wesley Papers/10).<h2>
<a name="LeedsandWinchester"></a>Leeds and Winchester</h2>Wesley's fame had preceded him, and he was much f&ecirc;ted on his arrival in Leeds in February 1842. As at Exeter, the move to new surroundings reinvigorated him, and his first few years in the town were marked by a series of new publications and compositions. Among these were three of his most important keyboard works, the two sets of <span class="italic">Three Pieces for a Chamber Organ</span> and the <span class="italic">March and Rondo</span> for piano (all issued in 1842), a printed psalter with chants for the parish church choir (1843), and his <span class="italic">Morning and Evening Cathedral Service</span> in E (1845). For the publication of the last he was indebted to the generosity of Martin Cawood, who was a wealthy brass-founder and unofficial music adviser to the vicar, Walter Farquhar Hook, and who had already been instrumental in securing his appointment. After hearing the setting of the Nicene creed (written at Hereford), Cawood had &#145;proposed to the Author the completion of the entire Service, undertaking to remunerate him for his work, and incur the sole risk and responsibility of its publication&#146;  (Wesley, &#145;Preface&#146;, vi&#150;vii). With its independent obbligato organ part, resourceful use of harmonic colour, and sense of scale, Wesley's service forms a landmark in the history of the genre and, despite failing to satisfy the critics, served as an inspiration to his contemporaries and successors. Its publication also gave him the opportunity to precede it with an extended preface, in which he outlined his strongly held views on the need for reform in cathedral music. He had first broached the subject in the preface to the second edition of <span class="italic">A Selection of Psalm Tunes</span> (1842), and had continued his campaign in two series of lectures on choral music given at the Liverpool Collegiate Institution in 1844 and 1846; its culmination was reached with his lengthy pamphlet <span class="italic">A Few Words on Cathedral Music and the Musical System of the Church, with a Plan of Reform</span> (1849), to which the <span class="italic">Reply to the Inquiries of the Cathedral Commissioners, Relative to Improvement in the Music of Divine Worship</span> (1854) forms a postscript. To Wesley the Anglican choral service was an art form uniting music, language, and architecture, and the church musician (in other words, himself) was an artist in the service of God. But such a romantically inspired vision was too personal to command wide support, and the immediate impact of his writings was consequently slight (although much of what he had striven for in the raising of musical standards and the better treatment of musicians was gradually achieved during the next three decades).<br>
<br>Wesley's last two sons, Charles Alexander (<i>b</i>. 4 Feb 1843) and William Ken (<i>b</i>. 8 July 1845), were both born in Leeds. During this period Wesley was also active in musical life away from the parish church, as player, teacher, and conductor. Foremost among these activities was his involvement in a new Leeds Choral Society, which, after an auspicious start, fell victim to rivalry with the &#145;old&#146; Leeds Choral Society and was disbanded in 1845. Also worthy of notice was his participation (as pianist) in the first provincial performance of Beethoven's symphony no. 9 at the 1843 annual meeting of the Yorkshire Amateur Musical Society. But it was as an organist that his fame was greatest, and he made two highly praised appearances as solo organist at the Birmingham festivals of 1843 and 1849. Indeed, after the former it was confidently stated by the <span class="italic">Musical World</span> that &#145;Dr. Wesley, as an organist, has no rival now living, except Dr. Mendelssohn&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical World</span>, 18, 1843, 324).<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the promising start he had made at the parish church, it did not take Wesley long to discover that his own and Hook's aims were rarely identical. &#145;Disappointed as I was with Dr Hook &amp; his powers to either aid his Church Music or me&#151;I soon bitterly repented of leaving Exeter&#146;  (letter to Henry Ford, Royal School of Church Music, MS album of letters), he was later to write, and the invitation to open the new organ in Tavistock parish church in June 1846 led him seriously to consider accepting the post of organist. His last three years in Leeds were clouded by regular disagreements with the vicar and also by injury: on the evening of 23 December 1847, while returning from a fishing expedition to the River Rye, he fell and badly fractured his right leg, and for the next six months he was laid up at the Black Swan at Helmsley. With unaccustomed time on his hands he turned again to composition and wrote two anthems, &#145;Cast me not away from thy presence&#146; and &#145;The Face of the Lord&#146;, and a second sacred song with orchestral accompaniment, &#145;I have been young and now am old&#146; (first performed at the 1850 Gloucester festival). All three set penitential texts, and both anthems contain autobiographical references to injury and accident: few pages of Wesley's music are more affecting than the harsh discords which accompany the words &#145;That the bones which thou hast broken shall rejoice&#146; in the first. During his convalescence (and unknown to him), Wesley's name had been put forward for the vacant Heather chair of music in the University of Oxford, but he was again passed over in favour of Sir Henry Bishop. Finally, in August 1849, he was successful in his application for the post of organist at Winchester Cathedral. His departure from Leeds was fortunately marred by none of the personal bitterness which had so soured his leaving Exeter, and in February 1850 he was invited back for a farewell dinner and to be presented with his portrait, painted by the local artist and singer W. K. Briggs.<br>
<br>Something of Wesley's reputation was clearly known in Winchester, and before his appointment was confirmed he was required by the dean and chapter to give a written undertaking to resign should they consider such a step to be advisable. Yet at first such a reassurance must have seemed unnecessary: in the precentor, W. N. Hooper, Wesley found someone willing to defer&#151;in practice if not in theory&#151;to his greater musical expertise. As in the past, new surroundings and a new position provided a stimulus to composition, and within two years he had completed his well-known anthems &#145;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace&#146; (<i>c</i>.1850) and &#145;Ascribe unto the Lord&#146; (1851). More importantly, he was also able to achieve his long-cherished ambition to publish a collection of anthems. The first announcements for a volume of six anthems had appeared as long ago as 1836 and printing had begun in 1840. But having lost money when the plates were destroyed (and become disillusioned over the failure of the dean and chapter of Exeter to support his music), Wesley had felt in no hurry to proceed further and did not return to the project until his enforced stay at Helmsley. By the time of its eventual publication in 1853 the collection had doubled in size. It represents Wesley's finest achievement and, arguably, the single most important English church music publication of the century. Despite including &#145;Ascribe unto the Lord&#146;, &#145;Blessed be the God and Father&#146;, &#145;Cast me not away&#146;, &#145;Let us lift up our heart&#146;, &#145;O Lord, thou art my God&#146;, &#145;The Face of the Lord&#146;, &#145;The Wilderness&#146;, &#145;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace&#146;, and &#145;Wash me throughly&#146;, its publication passed largely unnoticed, and this, together with the critical attacks made after the performance of an orchestrated version of &#145;The Wilderness&#146; at the Birmingham festival a year earlier, can have done little to encourage him. His best years as a composer were in fact already past, and the lack of public appreciation and recognition began increasingly to take its toll: few of his later anthems (among them &#145;By the word of the Lord&#146;, written for the opening of the new cathedral organ in June 1854, and &#145;Give the king thy judgements&#146;, written to celebrate the marriage of the prince of Wales in March 1863) maintain a uniformly high level of inspiration. Only &#145;Praise the Lord, o my soul&#146;, written for the opening of the organ in Holy Trinity Church, Winchester, in September 1861, approaches the standard of his earlier works.<br>
<br>The mid-1850s were an unhappy period for Wesley, as he was also at the centre of a controversy over the design he had prepared for the organ in St George's Hall, Liverpool. Although not completed by Henry Willis until 1855, it had been conceived a decade earlier, and the delay had magnified its old-fashioned features: for these, and for his insistence on &#145;G&#146; compass and mean-tone temperament, he was sternly taken to task by the musical press, and a heated public debate ensued. Indeed, in many ways Wesley was becoming a lonely, reactionary figure, unwilling&#151;or unable&#151;to adapt to the changing musical conditions. Even his application in 1856 for the vacant chair of music in the University of Cambridge seems to have been half-heartedly made, and he withdrew before the vote. Never one to court the friendship of his fellow musicians, he had relied for companionship on those of his father's generation, and as death now overtook them he found himself increasingly alone. With the appointment of an over-zealous precentor, Henry Wray, in 1858, life at the cathedral also became considerably less comfortable. Reprimands over the dereliction of his duty became more frequent, and when in February 1865 he was asked to adjudicate between candidates for the post of organist at Gloucester Cathedral he offered to take it himself.<br>
<br>Wesley's stay in Winchester had been the longest of his career, owing, it is said, to his desire to have his sons educated at Winchester College (of which he had been appointed organist in December 1850) and his appreciation of the fishing. His time there also saw his effective withdrawal from most musical activity outside the cathedral, although he maintained his association with the Royal Academy of Music (where he had been appointed the first professor of organ in August 1850) and continued his career as a recitalist. One notable appearance was at the opening of the organ in the Agricultural Hall, Islington, London, on 3 November 1863, when he played his newly written <span class="italic">Andante cantabile</span>, and he returned to the hall in October 1864 to conduct the only extended choral work of his maturity&#151;a setting for soloists, chorus, and orchestra of W. H. Bellamy's <span class="italic">Ode to Labour</span>, written for the opening of the North London Working Men's Industrial Exhibition.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Although Wesley had had little to do with orchestral or large-scale choral works since leaving Leeds, within a short time of his arrival in Gloucester he found himself having to devise programmes for the forthcoming Three Choirs festival which it was the city's turn to host in 1865. Not surprisingly his choice of music was unadventurous&#151;Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>, Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Elijah</span> and <span class="italic">Hymn of Praise</span>, Mozart's <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, and Spohr's <span class="italic">Die letzten Dinge</span>&#151;although he also orchestrated &#145;Ascribe unto the Lord&#146; and for the 1871 festival introduced J. S. Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span>. Notwithstanding his inexperience as a conductor (exacerbated by his nervousness on the podium), his direction of the Gloucester festivals of 1865, 1868, 1871, and 1874 remains his most significant achievement in the city. Indeed, on the evidence of both the music sung and contemporary comments on the state of the choir, he almost gave up the fight to raise musical standards at the cathedral. Composition, too, seems to have lost its attraction, and most of the works from his last decade were either reworkings of earlier material or commissions which lacked the spark of inspiration; one of the few exceptions was the unaccompanied chorus &#145;The Praise of Music&#146;, written in 1872 for Gounod's Royal Albert Hall Choral Society.<br>
<br>Yet Wesley still had one important contribution to make to church music, and in 1872 he published his vast collection of hymn and psalm tunes, <span class="italic">The European Psalmist</span>. Over twenty years in compilation, it included many of his own compositions as well as the largest number of J. S. Bach's chorale harmonizations yet published in England, but as a separate tune-book it was already obsolescent when issued. By now Wesley was very much a senior figure in the musical establishment and at last receiving the critical and public acknowledgement he had so yearned for in his youth: in 1873 he was offered the choice between a knighthood and a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum, and chose the latter. But such recognition, welcome as it must have been, had come too late, and the final years of his life were clouded by ill health and spent (as he wrote in 1870) in an &#145;objectionable&#146; place where there was &#145;no great demand for any peculiarly experienced musical ability and I must be content to rank with the low ones&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35019, fol. 168), a sad anticlimax to what had gone before. Only his financial position had improved following the sale in 1868 of most of his copyrights to Novello &amp; Co. for &pound;750. To the end, however, his reforming zeal remained undimmed, and in 1875 he proposed to Joseph Bennett a radical scheme for the abolition of cathedral chapters and their replacement by working clergy. Nothing, needless to say, came of this proposal. Wesley played for his last service on Christmas day 1875, and died from Bright's disease&#151;a malfunctioning of the kidneys&#151;on 19 April 1876; he was buried beside his daughter Mary in the old cemetery, Exeter.<br>
<br>To the world at large Wesley presented an often prickly exterior, but this masked a basic sense of insecurity which made him ever ready to spring to the defensive or imagine a slight where none had been intended&#151;reactions which particularly coloured his relations with professional colleagues and music critics. By those, like his pupils, from whom he felt no professional rivalry he was seen very differently, and one pupil, J. Kendrick Pyne, summed up his character thus: &#145;He was kind-hearted, manly, and courageous, though somewhat Utopian in his views. He would have become eminent in <i>any</i> profession&#146;  (Pyne, &#145;Wesleyana&#146;, 380).<br>
