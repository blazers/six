<span class="headword">Downes,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1549&#150;1628), <span class="occ">Greek scholar</span>, was born in Shropshire of unknown parentage. He was educated at Shrewsbury School under the first headmaster, Thomas Ashton, who was subsequently tutor to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. He became acquainted with Essex at Cambridge. He was admitted to a Lady Margaret Beaufort scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge, on 7 November 1567, proceeded BA in 1570&#150;71, and was elected a fellow of his college on 6 April 1571. He proceeded MA in 1574, was ordained deacon at Peterborough, Lincolnshire, on 25 June 1575, was admitted a senior fellow of St John's on 30 January 1580, and graduated BD in 1582.<br>
<br>With his pupil John Bois, Downes was active in the revival of the study of Greek at St John's and in 1585 he was elected regius professor of Greek at Cambridge. In 1586 he was among the signatories of a letter to William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, pressing the case for William Whitaker as master of St John's. He was appointed one of the translators of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1605 and assigned to the company, along with Bois, charged with the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>. Both also served as members of the company for the review of the whole work. These men earned 30<i>s</i>. a week, working in London, &#145;where, meeting (though Mr Downes would not go 'till he was either fetcht or threatened with a Pursuivant) their four Fellow-Labourers, they went dayly to Stationers' Hall, and in three Quarters of a year finished their Task&#146;  (Peck, vol. 2, bk 8, p. 48). Shortly after the completion of their work Downes and Bois were both engaged on Sir Henry Savile's edition of the works of John Chrysostom, Bois meeting with slightly more approbation than Downes, who resented it.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1608 Downes married, at Great St Mary's, Cambridge, Anna Delves and, no doubt on this account, wrote in that year to Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury, requesting part of the &pound;160 per annum assigned for the better maintenance of the Lady Margaret professorship, then vacant. In the following year a warrant was issued for payment to him of &pound;50 of James I's free gift. In 1610 he wrote to Dr Samuel Ward wishing to succeed to some of the preferments of Richard Clayton, dean of Peterborough. On 27 October 1613 he was collated to the Bath and Wells prebend of Dinder in Somerset and was duly installed on 18 April 1614. He had, though, resigned it by 17 February 1617.<br>
<br>The most vivid account of Downes is to be found in the diary of Simonds D'Ewes, who declined to attend his private lectures on account of their expense. However, he changed his mind and attended several in March 1619 on Demosthenes' Greek orations, <span class="italic">De corona</span>. He understood that Downes was regarded as &#145;the ablest Grecian of Christendom, being no native of Greece&#146;. He went on to write:<blockquote>When I came to his house near the public Schools, he sent for me up into a chamber, where I found him sitting in a chair with his legs upon a table that stood by him. He neither stirred his hat nor body, but only took me by the hand, and instantly fell into discourse (after a word or two of course had passed between us) touching matters of learning and criticism. He was of personage big and tall, long-faced and ruddy-coloured, and his eyes very lively, although I took him to be at that time at least seventy years old. (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 139)</blockquote>Apart from his contribution to the Authorized Version, Downes's major publications were directly related to his Cambridge lectures: <span class="italic">Eratosthenes, hoc est brevis et luculenta defensio Lysiae pro caede Eratosthenis</span> (1593), of which a copy in Cambridge University Library is annotated, perhaps by one of his auditors; and <span class="italic">Praelectiones in Philippicam de pace Demosthenis</span> (1621). He also contributed verses to Sir Francis Nethersole's memorial volume for Henry, prince of Wales, in 1612. His fluency in Greek is witnessed by his Greek letters to Isaac Casaubon, Metrophanes Kritopoulos, and others.<br>
<br>Downes died at Coton, near Cambridge, whither he had retired having reluctantly resigned his chair in 1625 after almost forty years' tenure, on 2 February 1628, and was buried there on 5 February. He left a book each to Trinity and St John's colleges, &pound;5 to a kinsman, and the residue of his estate to his wife. His monument in the church is illustrated by William Cole. His arms were: azure, a buck lodged, armed or, with a crescent for difference.<br>
