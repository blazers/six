<span class="headword">Watson,  William</span>  (1559?&#150;1603), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and conspirator</span>, was born, by his own calculation, on 23 April 1559. Apart from the fact that he hailed from co. Durham nothing is known of his family. According to his never entirely trustworthy autobiographical note, apparently written for Sir Edward Coke while Watson was a prisoner in the Gatehouse in April 1599, he was &#145;brought up in learning&#146;, and &#145;sent to Oxforde at 10 years of age&#146;, but his name does not appear among the surviving records. By his own account he cannot be the &#145;William Watson of Durham&#146; who matriculated aged twenty-six from All Souls on 28 November 1581, and who graduated BA the following February. According to the hostile testimony of Robert Persons, Watson attended the university merely as servant to John Boste. There can be no doubt, however, that he was well read. In his own words Watson's studies up to the age of eighteen &#145;were in the 7 liberall sciences intermixte withe the tongues, phisicke, common lawe &amp; especially histories all my life time for recreacon&#146;, while in the following three years he absorbed &#145;the lawes canon &amp; civil withe positive divinitie &amp; perfecting of my metaphisicke and philosophie&#146;  (Law, 1.212&#150;13).<br>
<br>Independent sources record that Watson was confirmed at Rheims on 25 March 1581, and that he received minor orders on 23 September 1583, and was ordained deacon on 22 March and priest at Laon on 5 April 1586. He was sent into England on 16 June in the same year, &#145;broughte of the sea in mariners apparell&#146;  (Law, 1.211&#150;12). Like so many of his colleagues on the English mission Watson was soon arrested. He was in the Marshalsea by October 1586. By his own account he was released on the understanding that he would leave the realm, was rearrested before the time allowed him expired, and was subsequently ill treated by Richard Topcliffe in the Bridewell prison: &#145;all the plagues &amp; torments of that place&#146;, he writes, were &#145;inflicted upon me (whereof fewe I think were lefte oute, &amp; some I dare say unknowen to her majesty or councell that ever I suffered, as whipping, grinding in the milne, withe the like)&#146; (ibid.; TNA: PRO, SP 12/202/61). Watson, however, managed to escape, in March 1588, thanks to the good offices of Margaret Ward, who smuggled a rope to him past lax security. Ward was put to death for this offence later in the year.<br>
<br>Again relying on Watson's own account he spent the next couple of years at Li&egrave;ge, returning to England in the autumn of 1590. One spy report suggests that he visited Ireland with Simon Fennel in 1593. There followed further imprisonments in Bridewell and the Gatehouse, and further escapes, first on 18 May 1597, and then on 24 June 1599. It was during the latter incarceration that he wrote his autobiographical memoir. This long-winded self-justification includes an interesting summary of the contents of his library:<blockquote>lawe bookes Machiavels werkes, tragedies, cronicles, coleccions of Doleman, Philopater, Leycesters commonwealthe (all 3 one man as is said) the bishop of Londons Genevian platforme, the discovery of the originall cause &amp; begining of our dislike of the Jesuites &amp; their procedings: and many other notes colleccions &amp; breifes of prophecies, genealogies, discents of hunting, hawking &amp; the like. (Law, 1.213)</blockquote>Once again Watson was arrested. He was in Wisbech Castle in 1600 and was later moved to the Clink, but upon being surprised when about to say mass for forty poor Catholics he was transferred to the much stricter confines of the King's Bench prison in April 1602. He was, though, soon released. Watson had, by then, emerged as one of the most vociferous of the so-called appellant Catholic priests, a grouping of those opposed to the introduction of an archpriest to administer the English church. While at Wisbech in November 1600 he signed the appeal made by the secular priests against Blackwell's appointment, and about this time he set out thirty reasons why he and his colleagues could not &#145;in conscience, policie, nor equitie admitt of Mr Blackwell archepresbiterie&#146;  (Law, 90&#150;98). The secular priests all shared a distrust of the Jesuits, who enthusiastically supported government by archpriest; but Watson's hatred and, indeed, fear of the society, sharpened by worries that the Jesuits favoured a Habsburg over a Stuart succession after Elizabeth I's death, verged on paranoia. His single solo published contribution to the archpriest controversy, the so-called <span class="italic">Quodlibets, or, Decacordon of Ten Quodlibeticall Questions Concerning Religion and State</span> (1602), is characterized by the extremity of its opinions and the eccentric intemperance with which these are expressed. The <span class="italic">Decacordon</span>, and other works in a similar vein, were countered by Robert Persons in his <span class="italic">A Manifestation of the Great Folly</span>, also published in 1602. Persons set on record his contempt for Watson, heaping personal abuse upon his opponent. He recalled that Watson had come to Rheims &#145;a poor little begging boy&#146;, had made his way through taking on menial tasks, and had entertained fellow students by tumbling and other demeaning tricks, &#145;for which his body was fitly made&#146;  (fols. 83&#150;4). So the unedifying debate rumbled on.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's government was prepared to be lenient towards the secular priests, realizing that in so doing they helped divide English Catholics and isolate the extremists bent on foreign intervention to reinstate the old religion. Following negotiations with Richard Bancroft, bishop of London, Watson and other seculars took an oath of allegiance in November 1602, specially fashioned to draw moderate Catholics apart from the intransigent recusant community. Those taking the oath were subsequently set at liberty. These contacts seem to have turned Watson's head, sharpening at the same time a taste for diplomacy and negotiation. Determined to forestall supposed Jesuit plots in favour of a Spanish successor to Elizabeth, he travelled to Edinburgh in the months prior to the queen's death. There, in return for pledging his loyalty to the Stuart cause, he received from James VI and his ministers vague but encouraging assurances of future toleration for Catholics in England. Such assurances were readily given&#151;to the earl of Northumberland and to the future gunpowder plotter Thomas Percy, among others&#151;but Watson, characteristically, built up this predictable molehill of platitudes into a mountain of promises guaranteeing an improvement in the lot of Catholic Englishmen. Like Thomas Percy he undoubtedly felt betrayed when no immediate toleration was forthcoming after March 1603. This consideration, combined with fears based on little evidence that the Jesuits were planning some form of coup before James's coronation, prompted Watson to participate in an enterprise which would oblige the new king to honour his supposed obligations.<br>
<br>The so-called Bye plot which followed proved a ludicrous fiasco. The principal conspirators hoped to recruit a band of Catholic gentlemen who would surprise the court at Greenwich on midsummer night in 1603, kidnap the king, seize the Tower of London, and hold James there as a hostage for toleration of Catholic religion&#151;to be guaranteed by secure strongholds and important prisoners&#151;and the removal from office and incarceration of ministers identified with the old, repressive, Elizabethan ways. Officially, no blood was to have been shed, but even the optimistic Watson accepted that Robert Cecil and other leading privy councillors might be prosecuted on the highest charges. When Watson and his chief confederate, the Catholic gentleman Sir Griffin Markham, discussed these matters Sir Griffin &#145;answered that, for his part, he carried no bloody mind; but he feared, when it came to it, they should be constrained, for safety of their own lives, to take away some of theirs&#146;  (Tierney, 4, appx, xli).<br>
<br>Markham's and Watson's colleagues&#151;another secular priest named William Clark, George Brooke (the discontented protestant younger brother of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham), and the Catholic gentleman poet Anthony Copley&#151;eagerly discussed all the changes that they would like to see. Watson himself earmarked the office of lord chancellor, albeit ostensibly on a caretaker basis. Still more absurd, he undertook to convert James to Catholicism by working upon the king's known inclination for theological debate. Here, as elsewhere in this conspiracy, optimistic expectation far outran good sense. Copley confessed that on another occasion he, Watson, and another fellow conspirator, Nicholas Kendall, discussed the project over a meal. &#145;What our discourse was&#146;, he declared, &#145;and how vain and variable all that supper time, I blush to remember: being wholly of tumult, without head or foot&#146;  (Tierney, 4, appx, iv). The principal plotters failed entirely to secure any show of support from their supposed backers. While Watson talked airily of supporters numbered in the thousands, he and his colleagues never seem to have discussed their plans with more than fifty or so possible recruits. Brooke and Markham tried to enlist support from the protestant peer Lord Grey of Wilton&#151;an experienced military commander thoroughly disenchanted with the new regime and, in particular, with the favour shown his enemy the earl of Southampton. But Grey, flatly opposed to Catholic toleration, distrusted Watson and Markham just as, when the test was made, they distrusted him. Midsummer day came and went. Watson lost heart and fled into the west country. Their hopes now dashed, the plotters who remained in London busily engaged in a round of recriminations.<br>
<br>Then their world began to fall apart. Copley was betrayed to Bancroft by the archpriest, George Blackwell, and by Henry Garnett, the Jesuit superior. Upon interrogation the unfortunate prisoner disclosed everything, or, at least, everything he knew. There were limits to Copley's knowledge, for he had been recruited by Watson and Markham at a fairly late stage. But it is Copley who, recalling Watson's discourses, puts the famous words into King James's mouth: &#145;Na Na, gud fayth, wee's not need the papists now!&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/2/51). A proclamation was issued for the arrest of the fugitive conspirators, Watson being described as &#145;a man of the lowest sort&#146;, about the age of thirty-six, &#145;his hair betwixt abram and flaxen, he looketh asquint, and is very purblind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Royal Proclamations</span>, 1.43).<br>
<br>Watson remained at large until early in August. According to John Aubrey he was captured &#145;in a field by the Hay in Herefordshire (or Brecknockshire)&#146; by the magistrate Henry Vaughan. Aubrey, inevitably, could not resist an old tale in which the captor suffered alongside his quarry: &#145;'Twas observed&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that Mr Vaughan did never prosper afterwards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 161). Watson was imprisoned in the Tower on 10 August 1603. In a series of highly detailed confessions, readily given, he provided the council with a colourful picture of his treason, professing penitence and regret for his actions. Unfortunately he added further insinuations that the king had gone back on promises to the English Catholics. At his trial at Winchester on 15 November he pleaded not guilty and persisted in this fatal line. Equally futile was his argument that a king uncrowned did not exercise full royal authority, and that in the interim between accession and coronation men might seek redress for particular grievances. Naturally, no observer had a good word to write about his stubbornness. We are told that Watson's &#145;absurd&#146; speeches, &#145;without grace, or utterance, or good deliverance&#146;, left spectators embarrassed and contemptuous rather than sympathetic  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 2.61&#150;5).<br>
<br>Sentenced to death, Watson and Clark were hanged, drawn, and quartered in the market place at Winchester on 29 November. Brooke was beheaded within a week, but both Copley and Markham were reprieved. Watson died well, asking forgiveness of the king, the Jesuits, and any others whom he might have offended. The executions were clumsily handled, Clark in particular being cut down from the gallows when still conscious. Robert Hobart, without advancing any evidence to support his theory, argued that the sentences were carried out on his own initiative by the lord chief justice, Sir John Popham, a fierce opponent of priests who is supposed to have feared that both men might be pardoned. It is, however, extremely unlikely that either priest would have been spared.<br>
