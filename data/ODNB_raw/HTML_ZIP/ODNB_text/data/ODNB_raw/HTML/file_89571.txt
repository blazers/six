<span class="headword">Mansfeld,  (Peter) Ernst (II)  von</span>, count von Mansfeld in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1626), <span class="occ">soldier and military entrepreneur</span>, was born in Luxembourg, the illegitimate son and thirteenth child of the imperial general Count (later Prince) Peter Ernst (I) von Mansfeld-Friedeburg (1517&#150;1604), who was at that time governor of the Spanish duchy of Luxembourg. His mother was Anna von Bentzerath. Since he was born out of wedlock his claim to his title and to noble status was doubtful, but he was apparently legitimized about 1607. He was brought up as a Catholic, a faith which he probably never officially abandoned, even when fighting for protestant princes.<br>
<br>When he was barely fifteen years old Mansfeld went to Hungary to fight against the Turks under the command of his elder half-brother Karl (<i>b</i>. 1543). Subsequently he fought for the Spanish in Flanders. However, when his petition to be granted some of the estates of his late father was rejected in 1610 by the Habsburg authorities he decided instead to serve the newly formed protestant union, an alliance of German protestant princes and cities which sought and later achieved association with the rulers of the United Provinces, Britain, and France. In practice, he spent the mid-1610s fighting the Habsburgs in northern Italy on behalf of Charles Emmanuel (I), duke of Savoy.<br>
<br>As central Europe began to slide into the conflict which became known as the Thirty Years' War, in August 1618 Mansfeld was appointed commander of a small army of about 3000 men initially paid for by Savoy but at the disposal of James VI and I's son-in-law Frederick V, the elector palatine, who, as the most prominent and militant member of the protestant union, spearheaded the German resistance to Habsburg power and recatholicization. Following Frederick's election by the estates as king of Bohemia in August 1619, Mansfeld fought against the imperial forces which sought to reimpose a Habsburg candidate. After the comprehensive defeat of Frederick's supporters in Bohemia at the battle of the White Mountain on 8 November 1620, Mansfeld was outlawed by the emperor Ferdinand as a rebel and traitor. None the less, having been reinforced, he moved back with a much larger army to Frederick's territory of the Lower Palatinate, under threat from Habsburg forces. In October 1621 he relieved the fortress of Frankenthal, then occupied Hagenau in Alsace, and on 27 April 1622 won a victory against the Catholic general Jean 'tSerclaes, count of Tilly, near Wiesloch. He thoroughly devastated Hesse-Darmstadt and other neighbouring dominions friendly to the emperor. By this time &#145;illustrious&#146;  (Cogswell, 242) Mansfeld enjoyed a high reputation as a sort of protestant hero in England, where his exploits were closely followed, and he was cultivated by several English diplomats. Equally, he was widely feared by Catholic princes because of his ruthlessness. Capitalizing on the latter, he had already opened negotiations with Habsburg commanders with the objective of changing sides, and he could not prevent the troops of the Catholic league from overrunning the Palatinate.<br>
<br>Dismissed by Frederick V in July despite the fact that he had still up to 30,000 men under his command, Mansfeld found new employment in the Dutch republic. On the way to the Netherlands he defeated a Spanish army at Fleurus in August 1622. The Dutch sent him to East Friesland, whose ruler was in league with the Habsburgs; it was plundered and totally devastated by his ill-paid and undisciplined mercenaries. Early in 1624 he dismissed his troops and went together with his brother-in-arms Christian of Brunswick and a number of his officers to The Hague to await a new command. Since it appeared that James I was looking for a general who was able to recruit an army which could be used to liberate the Palatinate or at least to put pressure on the emperor, in April Mansfeld travelled to England and approached the king. James, who had hitherto displayed extreme caution over direct military involvement on Frederick's behalf to the disappointment of many of his subjects, gave Mansfeld a commission to recruit troops in England as well as abroad and promised to pay him &pound;20,000 monthly provided France also supported his expedition. As Mansfeld was not English his actions could be disavowed if necessary, while the expenditure required was comparatively small as the <i>condottiere</i> was accustomed to work on a very small budget, relying mostly on plunder to finance his army. Moreover, unlike most other generals in protestant service, the otherwise unreliable Mansfeld had at least won one or two victories against Catholic armies in the past.<br>
<br>Mansfeld duly recruited up to 15,000 men in England and on the continent in autumn and winter 1624&#150;5. His army was shipped to the Netherlands, after earlier plans to disembark the troops in France had to be abandoned due to French resistance, and assembled near Gertruidenberg and Heusden in March 1625. Despite the fact that James had expressly instructed that the army should not be used directly against Spain, Mansfeld co-operated with the Dutch in trying to relieve the siege of Breda. This project failed, partly because his troops had already been much diminished in number by malnutrition, disease, and mass desertions. As Mansfeld's expedition had been financed by parliamentary subsidies this waste of money was later blamed in parliament on the militantly anti-Habsburg stance adopted by the then Prince Charles and the duke of Buckingham in the aftermath of their return from Spain and the pressure they had exerted on a reluctant James.<br>
<br>With the remnants of his army&#151;about 5000 men&#151;in October 1625 Mansfeld joined the king of Denmark in northern Germany, supported intermittently by English and French subsidies. Defeated by the imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein at Dessau bridge in April 1626 after a hard-fought battle, he nevertheless recruited new troops with relentless energy, invaded Silesia, and finally joined the prince of Transylvania in Hungary in his fight against the emperor. Abandoned by this new ally, he disbanded the remnants of his army and tried to reach Venice via Bosnia. On his way he fell ill and died near Sarajevo, probably in Rakovica, on 29 November 1626 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, and was buried at Split. One of the most unscrupulous and reckless military commanders of the period, who regularly sold his services to the highest bidder, he had failed to achieve his real objective, to conquer or to be granted a principality of his own in the Holy Roman empire.<br>
