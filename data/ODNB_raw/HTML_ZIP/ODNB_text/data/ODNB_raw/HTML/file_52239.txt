<span class="headword">Lyon,  Alexander Ward <span class="st"> [Alex]</span></span>  (1931&#150;1993), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 15 October 1931 at 60 Osmondthorpe Lane, Osmondthorpe, Leeds, the son of Alexander Pirie Lyon, master fish fryer and grocer, and his wife, Doris, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward. Both parents were devout Methodists. Rejected by Leeds grammar school, he attended West Leeds High School, from where he gained entrance to the law department of University College, London. While still a student he married, on 7 July 1951, Hilda Arandall (<i>b</i>. 1928/9), dress designer, and daughter of John Arandall, of Leeds; they had two sons and a daughter. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1954, and became a prominent figure on the north-east circuit. He later became chairman of the Society of Labour Lawyers.<br>
<br>Lyon contested York for the Labour Party in October 1964, and in March 1966 succeeded in defeating the personally popular Conservative MP Charles Longbottom. He held the seat until 1983. In assiduously nursing the constituency, he displayed a foretaste of those very qualities&#151;tenacity, to the point of occasional obduracy, and a high-minded sense of principle&#151;which in subsequent years were to irritate senior colleagues. Once in parliament he became immersed in the long-running Rhodesian crisis, and was conspicuously brave in making clear to Harold Wilson that many in the Labour Party would not support him in moves which looked as if they were giving in to Ian Smith and racism. But the event which made a seminal contribution to his political perceptions was the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of the Kenyan Asians. The number of immigrants from Kenya rose steadily each month throughout the winter of 1967&#150;8. Some 13,000 arrived in Britain in the first two months of 1968, twice as many as in the whole of 1965. The tabloid press exaggerated the extent to which they were drawing bountiful assistance from the social services, and carried endless stories of boatloads of illegal immigrants being smuggled ashore on isolated beaches on the south coast of England. In April 1968 Enoch Powell&#151;Lyon's <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>&#151;made his notorious &#145;rivers of blood&#146; speech and dockers marched to the House of Commons to support him. Lyon was prominent in the opposition to Powell's views, and acted as a focal point for resistance to harsh treatment of east African Asians. He voted against the government on the <span class="roman">Commonwealth Immigrants Act</span> of 1968.<br>
<br>In 1969 Lyon became an additional parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury, then parliamentary private secretary to the paymaster-general, Harold Lever. Following Labour's defeat in the general election of 1970 he became an opposition spokesman first on African affairs, then on home affairs. He supported Britain's entry into the EEC, and voted with the Conservative government in the crucial vote on 28 October 1971. He again defied a three-line whip on the <span class="roman">Housing Finance Bill</span> of 1972 and was consequently dismissed from the Labour front bench. Nevertheless, following Labour's narrow victory in the election of February 1974, he was appointed by Harold Wilson minister of state at the Home Office, responsible for race relations and immigration issues. He was at this time considered by many contemporaries as a possible future leader of the Labour Party. Nevertheless, his eighteen months as minister of state were controversial, and were marked in particular by disputes between him and his senior officials over the application of the immigration rules. When James Callaghan succeeded Wilson as prime minister in April 1976, he dismissed Lyon, and divided responsibility for immigration and race relations between several other ministers. There was significant, and by no means ephemeral, public discussion of whether, by this act, Callaghan was showing himself illiberal over race and immigration, or whether Lyon had been too zealous in helping immigrants. Lyon's friends pointed out that, unlike many of his predecessors in this difficult ministerial berth, who had simply sat in their sepulchral room in the Home Office, he had at least ventured forth to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, applying his razor-sharp QC's mind to the cause of delays in granting certificates of entry into Britain for dependants of people already settled. His critics&#151;in an age of Powellite rhetoric&#151;crudely, and almost certainly in error, thought that Lyon could single-handedly lose Labour a general election.<br>
<br>Following his return to the back benches, Lyon was appointed, in 1978, chairman of the UK Immigrants Advisory Service, in succession to Lord Foot. He was a member of the select committee on home affairs and chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party home affairs group, both from 1979 to 1983. After his first marriage ended in divorce, he married, on 19 February 1982, Clare Margaret Short (<i>b</i>. 1946), daughter of Francis Gerard Short, headteacher. She was at that point director of Youth Aid and the Unemployment Unit, but in June 1983 was elected Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood. At the same election Lyon lost his own seat. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed as suffering from spinal muscular dystrophy. He resigned as chairman of the UK Immigrants Advisory Service in 1984. He bore a long illness with characteristic courage, and with enormous support from his wife, Clare. He died at the Westbury Nursing Home, Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 30 September 1993; he was survived by his wife and by the three children of his first marriage.<br>
