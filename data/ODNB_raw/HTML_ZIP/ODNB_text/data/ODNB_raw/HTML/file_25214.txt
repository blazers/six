<span class="headword">Sharpe <span class="st"> [Sharp]</span>,  Leonell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1560, <em>d.</em> 1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, the second son of Robert Sharpe, a successful member of the Mercers' Company of London, and Juliann Mallory, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Mallory, mercer and lord mayor of London, was baptized on 28 February 1560 at St Michael Bassishaw, London. Schooled at Eton College, he entered King's College, Cambridge, in August 1576 and graduated BA in 1581, MA in 1584, and DTh in 1597. He was a fellow of King's (1579&#150;89) and was ordained deacon and priest in September 1587. At Cambridge, Sharpe met and cultivated Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, perhaps a distant relative by marriage, who was a student at Trinity College (1577&#150;81). Sharpe later claimed that Essex introduced him to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, who sent him to plead with Archbishop Whitgift on behalf of the presbyterians Thomas Cartwright, Dudley Fenner, and Humphrey Fenn. Essex also later employed him to lobby Whitgift on behalf of other leading radicals.<br>
<br>Sharpe was present with Leicester and Essex when Queen Elizabeth visited the army at Tilbury in August 1588&#151;he was employed to read out to the troops information about Spanish plans for crushing protestantism in England, and then to repeat the queen's speech to the army, of which he thus obtained the only copy. Despite his apparent lack of stature (he was often called &#145;Little Dr Sharpe&#146;), both tasks attest his skill as an orator. He became a chaplain of Essex no later than 1589, when he attended the earl on the Portugal expedition. He subsequently accompanied him abroad to Normandy in 1591 and Cadiz in 1596.<br>
<br>In April 1590 Sharpe was presented by the crown, presumably at Essex's behest, to the rectory of Malpas in Cheshire, but probably spent little time in this strongly recusant parish, since he served Essex as both household chaplain (he baptized the earl's son Henry in April 1595) and man of business in academic matters relating to Cambridge. He helped John Coke to leave Cambridge and enter service with Essex's friend Fulke Greville (<i>c</i>.1590), conveyed a message from Essex to the bishop of Winchester about the disposition of William Whitaker's fellowship at Eton in December 1595, and acted as a liaison between Cambridge and Essex after the earl became chancellor of the university in August 1598. An eighteenth-century chronicler of King's College claimed that Sharpe showed himself &#145;too obsequious&#146; to Essex, &#145;in prejudice to our revenue&#146;  (Allen, 2.931). Essex repaid such service by arranging for Sharpe to preach Lenten sermons at court in 1595, 1596, and 1598, and by urging Cambridge to allow him to proceed DTh without performing the usual exercises. This request failed, but Whitgift helped to secure Sharpe's doctorate in April 1597. In the same year, having presumably resigned Malpas, Sharpe was presented to the livings of Tiverton (Pitt portion) and Stokinteignhead in Devon. Difficulties with the latter presentation apparently prevented Sharpe from accompanying the earl on the Azores expedition that summer.<br>
<br>In 1602 Sharpe was listed as a supernumerary chaplain to the queen, an appointment that probably dates from 1598 or early 1599, before Essex lost influence over such promotions. Despite his entry into royal service, Sharpe was summoned to attend Essex on his sickbed in December 1599. His involvement (if any) in Essex's rising of February 1601 is unclear, but Sir Robert Cecil ordered him not to leave his Devon parishes for a period. He responded by seeking to distance himself from Essex's actions and cultivating Cecil's support. By April 1601 he had married Anne (<i>b</i>. 1578), second daughter of John Chichester of Hall, Devon. Sharpe was back at Cambridge in March 1603, where he preached a sermon praising the accession of James I. Along with a similarly laudatory tract, <span class="italic">Dialogus inter Angliam et Scotiam</span>, it was speedily published by the university printer.<br>
<br>These efforts to curry favour with the new regime proved successful. Sharpe was appointed a royal chaplain by 1604, regularly attending princes Henry and Charles, but found himself in trouble in June that year, when he was sent to the Tower for privately organizing various gentlemen to defend the king against an alleged conspiracy which might have involved bloodshed between English and Scots. Coming at a time when James's efforts to create a formal union of England and Scotland were facing strong opposition in parliament, this action was regarded as extremely provocative, but Sharpe's profuse claims of loyalty to the king and pleas to Cecil soon secured his release. He was appointed a chaplain to Prince Henry by the end of 1605 and archdeacon of Berkshire in November 1605.<br>
<br>By the time of Cecil's death in 1612 Sharpe had pinned his hopes of advancement on Prince Henry and Henry Howard, earl of Northampton. In that year Henry (energetically) and Northampton (with little enthusiasm) tried unsuccessfully to secure Sharpe's appointment as provost of King's. It is probably no coincidence that this year also witnessed Sharpe's return to print, this time as a writer of violently anti-papal tracts: his <span class="italic">Novum fidei symbolum</span> included a polemic later translated (by his older brother, Edward) as <span class="italic">A looking-glasse for the pope, wherein he may see his owne face, the expresse image of Antichrist</span> (1616). The king declined to receive the dedication to this work; another tract of about this period, on salvation and the gospel, remained unprinted. In November 1612 his hopes were even more severely dented by the death of Prince Henry, for whom Sharpe published a funeral sermon which included verses by his brothers Andrew, William, and Edward. Rumours in late 1613 that Sharpe would be appointed bishop of Rochester (presumably by the efforts of his patron, Northampton) came to nothing.<br>
<br>In June 1614 Sharpe and Sir Charles Cornwallis were interrogated by the privy council and sent to the Tower for inciting John Hoskyns to deliver an incendiary speech in parliament that threatened an English version of the &#145;Sicilian vespers&#146; if Scottish courtiers were not expelled from court. Northampton's death a few days later left them fully exposed to the king's anger. It emerged that Sharpe had chosen Hoskyns to give the speech and had suggested the reference to the massacre of foreigners in thirteenth-century Sicily, while Cornwallis had allegedly paid Hoskyns for undertaking the task. They were held in the Tower for a full year and Sharpe was subsequently banished to his Devon parishes until the following spring. He sought to regain royal favour by publishing an English version of his <span class="italic">Looking-Glasse</span> in 1616 and by allegedly ghost-writing Sir Lewis Stukeley's defence of his actions against Sir Walter Ralegh in 1618. By the 1620s, like Hoskyns, Sharpe had attached himself to George Villiers, from May 1623 duke of Buckingham. He sent advice to the duke about policies during the reign of Elizabeth and sermonized in defence of Buckingham's reputation after the defeat at the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;.<br>
<br>Buckingham's assassination in August 1628 removed the fifth and final major patron of Sharpe's career. Despite his apparently excellent Calvinist credentials as a chaplain to both Essex and Prince Henry, Sharpe adopted an increasingly anti-puritan tone by the 1610s. Towards the end of his life he even refused to pay his visitation fees to the new bishop of Exeter, the Calvinist Joseph Hall. Sharpe apparently spent Christmas 1629 with Sir Henry Wotton, provost of Eton and formerly Essex's secretary. He died on 1 January 1631 at Wotton's family home at Boughton Malherb, Kent, and was buried in the church there.<br>
