<span class="headword">Lowry,  Wilson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1760, <em>d.</em> 1824), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was baptized at St James's, Whitehaven, Cumberland, on 30 April 1760, the son of Strickland Lowry (1737&#150;1780&times;85), portrait and landscape painter, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. It is thought that he was named after the Belfast-born painter Joseph Wilson, with whom his father worked in Ireland. Lowry's childhood saw the family living for a time in Staffordshire, Shropshire, and Ireland. His first job was as a house-painter on the exterior of Warwick Castle. This was followed by a period in London and Arundel, Sussex. At about seventeen he was working for an engraver named Mr Ross in Worcester, where his family had finally settled.<br>
<br>Lowry's first plate was a trade card for a local fishmonger, for which he received as payment a large quantity of red herrings. In 1779 he produced illustrations for <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury</span> by Thomas Phillips, a resident of the town. At about eighteen he returned to London, took lodgings in Vauxhall, and began working for the prominent printer John Boydell. His works for Boydell included engravings after landscapes by Gaspar Poussin, Salvator Rosa, and George Robertson. Boydell introduced Lowry to William Blizard, surgeon at the London Hospital, for whom he made a drawing of the hot-air balloon flown by the pioneering aviator Vincenzo Lunardi in 1784. Blizard encouraged Lowry to practise surgery, but after four years spent training he abandoned this plan and instead returned to engraving. Though he never formally enrolled as a student, it is said he took drawing lessons in the Royal Academy Schools and was taught perspective by Thomas Malton the elder.<br>
<br>Lowry found work with John Browne, James Heath, and William Sharp, preparing the plates for works such as Sharp's version of Sir Joshua Reynolds's portrait of John Hunter, physician to George III. He also assisted William Byrne in etching the <span class="italic">Antiquities of Great Britain</span> drawn by Thomas Hearne, and published several portrait prints under his own name. But it was as an engraver of architecture and mechanism that Lowry earned distinction. Early examples include his illustrations for James Murphy's <span class="italic">Description of the Church of Batalha in Portugal</span> and <span class="italic">Travels in Portugal</span> of 1795; architectural prints for the 1796 edition of Lord Macartney's <span class="italic">Embassy to China</span>; and illustrations to Alexander Tilloch's <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, first published in 1798, and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>. In 1800 Lowry began work on plates for Dr Abraham Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>, which was to become the most successful reference book of its day. This was a mammoth task not only because the publication ran for the next twenty years, but also because each design had to be engraved twice over in order to print the 6000 copies required. Where no artist is given, the original drawing was made by Lowry or one of his daughters. The volumes contain some of Lowry's finest representations of machinery.<br>
<br>While working on the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> Lowry also contributed many of the illustrations to <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Magna Graecia</span>, written in 1807 by William Wilkins, future professor of architecture at the Royal Academy, and also the same author's translation of Vitruvius (1812). In 1809 he engraved twelve plates for Jane Marcet's <span class="italic">Conversations on Chemistry</span> and also several for Jeremiah Joyce's <span class="italic">Scientific Dialogues</span>. He contributed the plates to works by the builder and mathematician Peter Nicholson, including <span class="italic">The Principles of Architecture</span> (1795&#150;8); <span class="italic">A Treatise on Practical Perspective</span> (1815); an <span class="italic">Architectural Dictionary</span> (1819); and <span class="italic">The Rudiments of Practical Perspective</span> (1822). In 1820 his engravings were used in Thomas Squire's <span class="italic">A Popular Grammar of the Elements of Astronomy</span> and Frederick Nash's <span class="italic">Picturesque Views of the City of Paris</span>. Lowry's last works appear to be illustrations for George Crabb's <span class="italic">Universal Technological Dictionary</span> (1823) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>, published from 1817 onwards.<br>
<br>To ensure his engravings achieved an accuracy worthy of their scientific subjects, in 1798 Lowry became the first engraver to use diamond points for ruling. About 1790 he designed a ruling machine, which he first employed upon a plate in James Stuart's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Athens</span>; in 1801 he invented an instrument for striking elliptical curves, and in 1806 another for making perspective drawings. These were described and highly praised by John Landseer in his lectures on engraving at the Royal Institution. Though none of the above were patented, Lowry sold the formula of his prized etching fluid to Jacob Perkins, the American inventor, and Charles Heath, the engraver.<br>
<br>Lowry was a founder member of the Geological Society and in 1812 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He kept his own collection of geological specimens and, in a letter published in the <span class="italic">Imperial Magazine</span> in January 1820, contended that the formation of the earth had taken at least a million years with only the alluvial soils deposited by the biblical flood. He wrote many of the minor articles in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>. Undoubtedly it was Lowry's genuine interest in science and mechanics that enabled him to design and engrave his plates with such clarity.<br>
<br>Lowry was married twice, first to Miss Porter of Birmingham, with whom he had two daughters, Anne and Matilda. After she died he married Rebekah Eliza Delvalle (1761&#150;1848), a mineralogist of Spanish descent. The wedding took place on 16 June 1796 in the parish of St Marylebone, Middlesex. They had a daughter, Delvalle, and a son, <a name="cosubject_17102"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Wilson Lowry</span>  (1803&#150;1879), who was born on 7 October 1803 and baptized in March 1804 at St Marylebone, Middlesex. Lowry died at his home, 57 Great Titchfield Street, London, on 23 June 1824 after a two-year illness. He had by this time lost his wealth and was reliant on the Artists' Annuity Fund. His daughter Anne married the Greek scholar Hugh Stuart Boyd. His daughter Matilda married Mr Heming, an Oxford astronomer, and became a successful portrait painter, exhibiting four works at the Royal Academy in 1808 and 1809. In 1822 his daughter Delvalle wrote and illustrated <span class="italic">Conversations on Mineralogy</span> and in 1825 she married as his second wife John Varley, the painter, with whom the family had been friends since 1802. In 1846 she wrote the <span class="italic">Engineer's Manual of Mineralogy and Geology</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Rudimentary Geology</span> in 1848. Lowry's son, Joseph Wilson Lowry, also worked as an <span class="occ">engraver</span>. He collaborated with his father on the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>, and later specialized in topographical and geological subjects, exhibiting two works at the Royal Academy in 1829 and 1830. He died, unmarried, on 15 June 1879 at Robert Street, Hampstead Road, London.<br>
<br>A portrait of Wilson Lowry, drawn by John Linnell and engraved by Linnell and William Blake, was published soon after his death. There are also two known portraits of Lowry drawn by his daughter Matilda. One is a watercolour dating from about 1810 which is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. The second was engraved by James Thomson for the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (August 1824), and by Henry Meyer for the <span class="italic">Imperial Magazine</span> (February 1825). Examples of Lowry's work can be found in the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
