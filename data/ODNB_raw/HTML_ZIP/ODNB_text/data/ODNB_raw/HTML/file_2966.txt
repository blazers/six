<span class="headword">Botetourt,  John</span>, first Lord Botetourt  (<em>d.</em> 1324), <span class="occ">admiral</span>, emerged from obscurity in the 1280s and became a politically influential baron, an active soldier, and a prominent naval commander. For such a well-connected man Botetourt's origins and parentage are astonishingly obscure. An unsubstantiated reference in the Hailes Abbey chronicle suggests that he was an illegitimate son of Edward I, but it has been argued plausibly that he was the eldest son of Guy Botetourt (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1316) of Little Ellingham, Norfolk, and his wife, Ada; if so he had at least five brothers, Roger, Robert, Guy, Ralph, and Thomas, and possibly a sixth, William. In either case Botetourt's later prominence was unquestionably the result of his long attachment to the royal household rather than of any inherited wealth, and he rose through the ranks to become a knight by Christmas 1284, and a banneret in 1298. Household service brought varied responsibilities, and Sir John's earliest domestic exploits were concentrated in the Welsh marches, including an appointment as keeper of St Briavels Castle, Gloucestershire, in January 1291, and a number of judicial commissions in following years. Botetourt's most important contribution, though, was in the military sphere: his royal connections left him well placed, if not obliged, to participate in a long series of campaigns, including expeditions to Gascony in 1286, 1288, and 1295. Botetourt's estates&#151;so far as they can be identified&#151;may explain this early career focus, for by the turn of the fourteenth century he owned enough property in Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire to qualify for personal military service. He also acquired a one-third stake in the barony of Bedford inherited in 1285 by his wife, Maud (<i>c</i>.1269&#150;1328), who was the daughter of Thomas fitz Otho and Beatrice de Beauchamp and whom he had married possibly as early as 1282 and certainly by 1292. She also inherited estates in Suffolk, Essex, and Worcestershire. This inheritance probably helps explain why Botetourt's career came to concentrate almost exclusively on East Anglia, and Essex in particular. In March 1294, for example, Sir John was appointed to try alleged maritime crimes against the men of Holland in a period of heightened diplomatic sensitivity. Soon afterwards, in November of the same year, he received his first recorded naval commission as &#145;sub-captain&#146; of a force sent out from Great Yarmouth; and in March 1297 an existing brief to defend the port's adjacent maritime lands was expanded to include the entire eastern coastline, a sign of Botetourt's growing reputation. Yet any long-term naval responsibilities were interrupted by a period of intense campaigning in Scotland. Botetourt fought alongside his brother Guy at Falkirk in 1298, was present at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300, and afterwards led, with mixed success, a number of <i>chevauch&eacute;es</i> against the Scots until Edward I's death in July 1307 brought a change of regime, a change of fortunes, and a change of emphasis.<br>
<br>Under Edward II, Botetourt's influence was severely curtailed&#151;his loyalty had evidently been to Edward I rather than the crown, and he was consistently associated with the baronial coalition against the king and his courtiers. He was a signatory of the so-called &#145;Boulogne declaration&#146; of January 1308 which was a veiled attack upon Piers Gaveston, Edward II's notorious favourite, whose capture and execution he endorsed in June 1312. Ultimately Botetourt took up arms against the king at Boroughbridge in March 1322, and in the ensuing confusion temporarily fled the country while his eldest son, Thomas, arranged an expensive formal pardon on his behalf. Botetourt also worked as a mediator for the baronial party in the period 1311&#150;13, however, and, ironically, the brief periods of reconciliation between the factions saw his renewed appointment to military and civil office. Personal summonses to parliament from 1305 onwards were combined with an appointment as admiral of the eastern fleet in March 1315, and several judicial commissions in East Anglia. He died on 25 November 1324 leaving property in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Huntingdonshire. With his wife, Maud, Botetourt had four sons, Thomas, John, Otes, and Robert, and three daughters, Joan, Ada, and Elizabeth. Thomas Botetourt predeceased his father in July 1322 and the family estates therefore passed to Thomas's son, John (<i>c</i>.1317&#150;1339).<br>
