<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plunket,  Oliver</span> <span class="st"> [St Oliver Plunket]</span>  (1625&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh</span>, said to have been a younger son of John Plunket of Loughcrew, co. Meath, and his wife, Thomassina, daughter of Henry Dillon, was born, according to a contemporary horoscope, on 1 November 1625. Through his father, a younger son of James Plunket, seventh Lord Killeen, he was cousin to Luke, first earl of Fingall. His mother's grandfather was Sir Lucas Dillon, and she was therefore cousin to the second earl of Roscommon.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>Although he was descended from an Old English dynasty, it has been surmised, on the grounds of his familiarity with Gaelic culture, that Plunket was fostered in the home of the Irish O'Farrells of Longford. Schooled at Killeen by his cousin Patrick Plunket, brother of the first earl of Fingall and later Roman Catholic bishop of Ardagh, in 1647 Plunket departed from Ireland in the company of the former papal envoy Pierfrancesco Scarampi and headed for the Irish College in Rome, where he received a formal ecclesiastical education and seminary training. A subdiaconate was conferred on him in December 1653. He was ordained a few days later, on 1 January 1654. In June that year Plunket requested and was granted suspension of his formal undertaking to return to Ireland as a priest. Rather than take his chances with the new regime in Ireland, he remained at Rome, residing with the Oratorians at the church of San Gerolamo della Carita. He devoted himself to further study in law at the University of Rome. In September 1657 Plunket was appointed professor of theology at the Urban College, where he had been ordained. The college was missionary seminary of the congregation of propaganda, responsible for the preservation of the Catholic faith wherever it languished in adversity. During Plunket's stay in Rome he was frequently consulted on Irish affairs by members of the congregation.<br>
<br>With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, hopes rose for the revival of Catholic fortunes in Ireland, and Plunket was one of many who eventually returned to minister there. Edmund O'Reilly, archbishop of Armagh, died in 1669, and Plunket sought and obtained promotion to the vacant see in July that year. His appointment appears to have had the support of Pope Clement IX, who, as Cardinal Rospigliosi, had been attached to the Congregation de Propaganda Fide. It was claimed by Cardinal Moran in his memoir of Plunket that the pope had personally circumvented the discussion of alternative candidates for the Irish primatial see. Plunket himself overcame local opposition by emphasizing his family's fidelity to Rome and good standing with the crown, citing in particular the example of his kinsman the second earl of Fingall, executed by the parliamentarian regime at Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>Plunket was consecrated at Ghent by the local bishop, acting with the assistance of Nicholas French, bishop of Ferns, on 1 December 1669. He then set out for Ireland, travelling via London, where he had an audience with Queen Catherine of Braganza and enjoyed the hospitality of her chief almoner, Father Philip Thomas Howard, future vicar apostolic in England, to whom Plunket's severed head would one day be entrusted.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoIreland16701673"></a>Return to Ireland, 1670&#150;1673</h2>After a difficult journey to Holyhead, Plunket arrived in Ireland on the feast of St Patrick 1670. Having stayed briefly in Dublin with his kinsman the papal knight Sir Nicholas Plunket, he entered his diocese and conducted a visitation by the middle of April. He confirmed Patrick O'Daly as vicar-general, received promises of respectable financial support from the clergy and laity, and resolved to remain within his diocese rather than return to the hospitality of his family. In his letters to Rome he marvelled at the devotion of the people and their constancy in the faith in the face of opposition and suffering, and claimed to have confirmed 10,000 by the beginning of May. He organized a provincial synod of the representatives of all the northern dioceses, held in two sessions in order to avoid attracting attention at a time when caution was necessary.<br>
<br>During the first few months of his residence Plunket adopted disguise as Captain Browne, a soldier, &#145;with my sword, my wig and my pistols&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 301). Early in May, however, the atmosphere in Ireland was altered with the replacement of John Robartes, Lord Robartes, as viceroy by John Berkeley, Lord Berkeley. There ensued a period of relative freedom. By August 1670, evidently with the permission of the protestant primate, Archbishop James Margetson, Plunket had set up a school for scions of the Ulster Catholic gentry at Drogheda, staffed by two Jesuits. During Berkeley's brief tenure at Dublin Castle, not only was Plunket able to put off his disguises and move about his diocese quite freely, he was even invited occasionally to consult with the lord lieutenant, and acted co-operatively with protestant authorities in a temporarily successful attempt to pacify the native Irish raparees and tories whose activities were reducing parts of Ulster to a state of lawlessness.<br>
<br>On the whole Plunket's major concerns during the 1670s derived from the jealousies and rivalries of his fellow Catholics. He attempted to resolve a number of disputes which had arisen both from the absence of clear leadership during the 1650s and in consequence of the growing conflict surrounding the reorientation of the Catholic faith in Ireland which came to a head over the remonstrance in the 1660s. But he did not escape damaging entanglement in some of these disputes, many of which revolved around the long-standing antagonisms between Gaelic and Old English, papal and Irish interests, in all of which, by virtue of his background, education, and subsequent career, Plunket was himself already deeply mired. The manner of his appointment had created substantial hostility even within his own province, and such feelings were exacerbated by episodes such as the pacification of the tories, which some chose to interpret as a deliberate betrayal of honest Catholics impoverished by dispossession in the interests of the protestant colonial oppressors. Some felt Plunket appeared far too concerned to demonstrate loyalty to the treacherous English crown.<br>
<br>On top of these simmering tensions there was no love lost between the primate and his fellow archbishop, Peter Talbot of Dublin. In June 1670 Plunket had called a meeting of the resident archbishops and bishops, who met in Dublin in an attempt to adopt a united front on various matters of internal organization and discipline. This became the occasion for the renewal of an age-old conflict between the two archbishoprics over precedence, a subject on which both men discoursed publicly in print. Plunket and Talbot's mutual antagonism only deepened when Plunket took a decision in favour of the Dominicans, to the prejudice of the Franciscan order, in a controversy over territorial rights to seek alms. In 1671 Rome was informed, apparently quite maliciously, that the new archbishop was suspect in regard to his observance of the vow of celibacy, that he was a spy, even that he would shortly convert to protestantism. Archbishop Talbot was not the author of the various accusations levelled against his brother prelate, but was less than discreet about them, and after an investigation he was obliged temporarily to leave the country in 1673, remaining in exile in England and France until 1678, and returning only in time to be arrested and imprisoned in Dublin Castle, whence he never emerged.<h2>
<a name="Increasingdifficulties16731678"></a>Increasing difficulties, 1673&#150;1678</h2>With the renewal of religious persecution in 1673 Plunket's school was shut down, and in 1674 he spent six months on the run in the uplands of southern Ulster under threat of punishment and deportation imposed by the new viceroy, the earl of Essex, on all Catholic clergy. On 27 January 1674, using the pseudonym Thomas Cox, Plunket wrote to the internuncio at Brussels describing his flight:<blockquote>my companion [John Brenan, Roman Catholic bishop of Waterford and Lismore] and I on the 18th of this month [old style] &hellip; were obliged to take to the road. Snow mixed with big hard hailstones was falling, a cutting wind was blowing into our faces, and the snow and hail blew so fiercely into our eyes, and affected them so much that we are hardly able to use them even yet. Finally, after frequent danger of being suffocated by the snow in the valleys we arrived at the house of a poor gentleman who had nothing to lose</blockquote>and who sheltered them for over a week  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 398). This was a fraught time of cold and hunger for the archbishop, who wrote a number of other letters from various hiding places deploring the persecution visited on Ireland, which he likened to the Roman persecution of Christianity. On at least one occasion he came close to being apprehended in his vestments as he prepared for mass.<br>
<br>In August 1678 Plunket held his second and last provincial synod. All the northern dioceses were represented, and of twelve present five bore the surname Plunket. Twenty-six statutes were enacted, dealing with the life and ministry of priests in regard to specific topics, such as the raparees, the rights of Rome in relation to the appointment of bishops, fosterage by priests, the use of alcohol and the visiting of taverns, provision of altar-ware, remuneration of priests, controversies over boundaries, the requirement of the presence of a priest and two witnesses for the validity of marriage, and a severe penalty for those who should marry without dispensation within the forbidden degrees of kindred. A subcommittee to deal with seven contentious issues was set up, and it was decreed that the archbishop should visit every diocese in the province as soon as convenient. Without delay Plunket began his visitation in Meath and Clonmacnoise. But the storm clouds were now gathering.<br>
<br>In the autumn it was decreed once again that all Catholic bishops, vicar-generals, and members of religious orders depart Ireland, heavy fines being threatened to any lay person who sheltered them. Plunket went back into hiding as the sensational disclosure in England of a conspiracy to kill the king and place his Catholic brother on the throne, the so-called Popish Plot, initiated a new round of persecution, more deadly than before. Some time after the first revelations an Irish dimension to the plot was &#145;discovered&#146;, and although in 1674 there had been some question as to whether much effort had been made to apprehend Catholic clergy, this time firm action was finally taken.<h2>
<a name="Captureandtrial16791681"></a>Capture and trial, 1679&#150;1681</h2>On 6 December 1679 a well-laid plan was put in execution with the arrest of Plunket at Naul, co. Dublin, where he had been hiding in disguise. He was taken to Dublin Castle, and there endured solitary confinement until 16 January 1680, when he received visitors, no evidence of plotting having emerged from his letters and papers. However, several individuals whom Plunket had aggrieved one way or another then conspired against him. Edmund Murphy, former parish priest of Killeavy in south Armagh, had been suspended from priestly duties by the archbishop for colluding with the raparees. He and one William Hetherington concocted the original accusation that Plunket was involved in the Popish Plot, which they laid before the earl of Shaftesbury in London.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Plunket's enemies among the Franciscans and those northern Irish who had always resented the appointment to the province of Armagh of someone they perceived as an outsider now availed themselves of an opportunity to avenge themselves on the archbishop. One of them, Anthony Daly, another who had fallen foul of the archbishop's disciplinary hold over his diocese, continued to pursue his long-standing campaign against Plunket by forwarding to Rome a range of accusations similar to those first made in 1671 in an attempt to undermine his credit with the Holy See. Several others, including John MacMoyer, provided the &#145;evidence&#146; for Plunket's supposed engagement in the Popish Plot. But at his trial, held at Dundalk on 23 and 24 July 1680, no witnesses against him were forthcoming, Murphy, MacMoyer, and their co-accusers fearing to show their faces in a town where both they and the accused were so well known. Despite the exclusion of Catholics from the jury, it was not possible to find the bill of indictment, in which Plunket was accused of treasonably plotting to raise 70,000 Catholics for the murderous extirpation of protestantism in Ireland, further to the establishment of Catholicism there with armed French assistance. Consequently the proceedings were transferred to London, where Plunket arrived in late October, entering the prison at Newgate on the 29th.<br>
<br>Even in London it proved difficult to obtain a guilty verdict. The first grand jury refused to find a bill because the witnesses contradicted each other. The duke of Ormond, the viceroy responsible for Plunket's detention in 1679, on being informed of the sources of information against the archbishop, had remarked that &#145;if rogues they must be that discover roguery, these must be the best discoverers because they are the greatest rogues &hellip; no schoolboy would trust them with a design for the robbing of an orchard&#146;  (Walker, 329). Eventually, however, Plunket was arraigned in the king's bench at Westminster Hall on 3 May 1681. He objected to the jurisdiction on the ground of his previous arraignment in Ireland, but this was overruled, and the trial at his request was fixed for 8 June, to enable him to bring over evidence. But the Irish courts refused to compromise their independence by forwarding records without direct orders from the crown, and the English judges refused to receive evidence as to the previous convictions of the witnesses against Plunket.<br>
<br>The archbishop was roughly treated at the hands of both the prosecuting counsel, led by Sir Robert Sawyer, and the judges sitting in his case. Lord Chief Justice Sir Francis Pemberton openly declared that the very foundation of the archbishop's treason was not so much any action of his against the crown, as his setting up and holding forth an inherently blasphemous and superstitious religion. The evidence that he had plotted to land a massive French army at Carlingford was barely credible, but the jury took only fifteen minutes to return a guilty verdict. The archbishop may not have helped himself by his own ready admission that he had done everything in his power to organize and regulate the Roman Catholic hierarchy and laity in Ireland, and by his ingenuous acceptance that there might be matter for a <i>praemunire</i>.<h2>
<a name="Executionandcanonization"></a>Execution and canonization</h2>Ultimately, it was the violent background of partisan politics in the English capital amid the near hysteria of anti-popery associated with the exclusion crisis that sealed Plunket's fate. Onlookers as great and influential as the earl of Essex readily conceded that Plunket was innocent. He and others intimately involved in Irish affairs well knew that Plunket had always remained loyal to the crown, even to the extent of leading the Catholic hierarchy as far as it was possible to go in repudiation of the doctrine of the papal deposing power. But private hand-wringing could not save Plunket from the traitor's death which he suffered on 1 July 1681, when the industry of others on his behalf, such as the queen, and the Spanish and French ambassadors, finally failed. From the scaffold at Tyburn, Plunket made a speech asserting his innocence and challenging the evidence against him. Its wide circulation probably reflected the fact that the tide which had swept Plunket away was now turning rapidly the other way. The very day after that on which the archbishop was hanged, drawn, and quartered, Shaftesbury, the orchestrator of the demands for exclusion and a leader of the anti-Catholic pack, was himself imprisoned.<br>
<br>A collection of nine letters and short notes written by Plunket during his final days is preserved at Downside Benedictine abbey, near Bath, where the archbishop's tomb has been situated since 1883. The letters were addressed to a fellow prisoner, Maurus Corker, a native of Yorkshire and a Benedictine priest, a former chaplain to Catherine of Braganza in custody in Newgate for his priesthood. Corker was eventually released and sent into exile. It was to him that Plunket entrusted everything in his last days. Through him and his friends, as well as through his own friends and his servant, James McKenna, the archbishop was able to communicate and even have mass discreetly in his cell. In several of the letters Plunket wrote with regret of his many sins and shortcomings, the many stains on the archiepiscopal pallium, the head which had soiled the mitre. But he maintained a deep confidence in divine mercy, and was convinced that his death would be that of a martyr. &#145;Happy are we who have a second baptism, nay a third; water we received, the sacrament of penance we got. And now we have &hellip; the baptism of blood.&#146; He did not fear the butchery which awaited him, and thought of Christ, who suffered &#145;the most paineful death of the cross which &hellip; compared to that of Tyburne, as I hear ye description of it is but a fleabyting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 579).<br>
<br>Plunket's executioner was bribed, so that, having been subjected to punishment, the archbishop's dismembered body was saved from the execution fire. Buried first at St Giles-in-the-Fields, in London, two years later the body was exhumed by Corker when he went to Germany. The skull he then presented to Plunket's one-time host, Thomas Howard, by this time Cardinal Norfolk. About 1721 a successor to Plunket's see arranged the transfer of the skull to the Dominican nuns at Drogheda, where it is now displayed in St Peter's Church. The rest of the remains made numerous peregrinations. One of the archbishop's ribs is borne in procession around Drogheda annually.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1918 Plunket was declared a martyr to the Catholic faith, and he was beatified on 23 May 1920. In 1974 the formal acceptance of claims for a miraculous intercession by the martyr opened the way to Plunket's canonization by Pope Paul VI on 12 October 1975.<br>
