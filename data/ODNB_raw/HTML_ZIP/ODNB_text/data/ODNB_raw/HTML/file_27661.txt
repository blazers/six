<span class="headword">Traill,  Henry Duff</span>  (1842&#150;1900), <span class="occ">satirist and journalist</span>, was born at Morden Hill, Blackheath, on 14 August 1842, the sixth son of James Traill, a magistrate of Greenwich and Woolwich, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whateley, of Handsworth, Staffordshire. His uncle, George Traill, was Liberal MP for Orkney and Caithness until 1869. Traill was educated from April 1853 at Merchant Taylors' School, London, where he was good at both classics and mathematics and came top of the school. He was elected to St John's College, Oxford, in 1861, as one of the last holders of a fellowship reserved for former pupils of Merchant Taylors' School. Although he gained a first class in classical moderations in 1863, he graduated BA with a second class degree in natural science in 1865. In 1868 he was awarded a BCL degree, and in 1873 the honorary degree of DCL. He relinquished his fellowship on his marriage in 1879 to Emily (<i>b</i>. 1848/9), daughter of Henry George Mitchell, tradesman.<br>
<br>Traill was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1869 and in 1871 he was appointed an inspector of returns under the education office. But journalism particularly attracted him, and he soon found work on the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. After settling in London he contributed to several newspapers, including <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and in 1873 joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, edited by Frederick Greenwood. When the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span> was founded in 1880 he left the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> to join the staff of the new journal, and also wrote literary reviews, essays, and leading articles for the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. He also wrote mainly satirical verses, some of which were republished as <span class="italic">Recaptured Rhymes</span> (1882) and <span class="italic">Saturday Songs</span> (1890). His gift for parody can be seen at its best, perhaps, in the pamphlet <span class="italic">The Israelitish Question and the Comments of the Canaan Journals Thereon</span> (which he published anonymously in 1876), in which the style of the leading London newspapers was cleverly caricatured.<br>
<br>In 1882 Traill left the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span> to join the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, where he acted as chief political leader writer until 1897. He continued to contribute to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, and after 1888 again wrote for the <span class="italic">St James's</span>. Between 1889 and 1891 he was editor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. In 1897 on its foundation, he became the editor of <span class="italic">Literature</span>, a post he held until his death.<br>
<br>Traill also published books on a wide variety of subjects. In 1881 he wrote a short account in the <span class="roman">English Citizen</span> series, of the British constitution. He also contributed short lives of Sterne (1882) and Coleridge (1884) for the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series, as well as full-scale biographies of Shaftesbury (1886), William III (1888), Strafford (1889), the marquess of Salisbury (1891), and Lord Cromer (1897). A more elaborate and deeply researched biography was his <span class="italic">Life of Sir John Franklin</span> (1896), the Arctic explorer, which drew on personal documents placed at his disposal by Franklin's family. Between 1893 and 1897 he was editor of an ambitious project, <span class="italic">Social England</span>, which aimed to give a historical account of the social, industrial, and political development of the nation.<br>
<br>Traill's satirical gifts are exhibited in the collections of his literary and miscellaneous essays, <span class="italic">Number Twenty</span> (1892) and <span class="italic">The New Fiction</span> (1897), and particularly in <span class="italic">The New Lucian</span>, published in 1884. He also used his experience of writing and acting in school and university plays to write for the stage. His <span class="italic">Glaucus: a Tale of a Fish</span> was performed at the Olympic Theatre in 1865 with the popular burlesque actress Ellen Farren in the title role. His most ambitious play was <span class="italic">The Medicine Man</span>, written in collaboration with Robert Hichens and produced by Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in May 1898.<br>
<br>Traill was fond of travel, especially to the Mediterranean, and in 1893 and in 1895 he visited Egypt, describing the second journey in animated letters to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, which were afterwards republished as <span class="italic">From Cairo to the Soudan Frontier</span> (1896). His last book, an account of recent north-eastern African history, was published posthumously as <span class="italic">England, Egypt, and the Soudan</span> (1900). Traill died at the Great Western Hotel, Paddington, London, on 21 February 1900 from a wholly unsuspected disease of the heart. He was buried on 26 February 1900 in the Paddington old cemetery, Kilburn. His widow was granted a civil-list pension.<br>
