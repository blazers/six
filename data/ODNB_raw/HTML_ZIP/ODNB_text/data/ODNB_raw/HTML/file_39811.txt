<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meiggs,  Russell</span>  (1902&#150;1989), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 20 October 1902 in Balham, London, the only son and younger child of William Herrick Meiggs, of no fixed occupation but who described himself on his son's birth certificate as &#145;general merchant&#146;, and his wife, Mary Gertrude May, of Brantham, Suffolk. William Meiggs abandoned his family when his children were young, and they were brought up in great poverty. Russell Meiggs was educated at Christ's Hospital and at Keble College, Oxford, taking first classes in both classical honour moderations (1923) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1925). He then began to work on Ostia, the ancient port of Rome, as Pelham student at the British School at Rome. On his return he taught at his old school for two years; then in 1928 he was elected to a tutorship at his former college, becoming a fellow in 1930 and dean in 1935.<br>
<br>This smooth progress was interrupted when, in 1939, Meiggs left Keble and became a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. Balliol's classical teaching had declined alarmingly, and Meiggs later described his move as &#145;like a First Division team needing to bring in a goalkeeper from a Third Division side&#146;. He remained at Balliol until his retirement in 1970, and became profoundly identified with the college. During this period he was university lecturer in ancient history. Meiggs married on 6 December 1941, at Christ Church, Clifton, <a href="#cosubject_97088">Pauline Gregg [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>For many years Meiggs published little. He lavished his great energies on teaching, college activities, and that wide range of contacts which often enabled him to place a pupil. It was typical of his attitude to scholarship that he put so much energy into co-operative ventures and the revision of standard works. In 1951, with Antony Andrewes, he published a thoroughly revised version of Sir George Hill's <span class="italic">Sources for Greek History</span> (1897). He also revised the <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> by J. B. Bury (third edn, 1951; fourth edn, 1975). <span class="italic">Roman Ostia</span> (1960; revised edn, 1973), his first major book, sprang from thirty-five years of work and reflection. It combines mastery of the evidence with a synthesis of archaeology, social history, economics, and religion, which goes far beyond most local histories. It anticipates interests which historians were to find increasingly central in the next thirty years. Meiggs was elected FBA in 1961. In 1969 he edited <span class="italic">A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions</span> with David M. Lewis. In 1972 appeared his second main work, <span class="italic">The Athenian Empire</span>. It handled the complex and controversial evidence without the violent disagreements which had infected that area of scholarship, and the book is almost surprisingly cool. The mastery of detail is impressive; the work is a judicious account of the views of its period.<br>
<br>The later years of Meiggs's retirement were darkened by increasing ill health, immobility, and, at the end, loss of sight. With great courage he battled to finish <span class="italic">Trees and Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean World</span> (1982). Meiggs had served in the Second World War as chief labour officer in the Ministry of Supply, home timber production, and had published <span class="italic">Home Timber Production, 1939&#150;1945</span> (1949). His last major work was a pioneering one on a fundamental feature of ancient society: all the uses of timber and the history of forestation of the Mediterranean area. The work displayed so high a level of technical expertise that most classical scholars were daunted, and disappointingly few reviews appeared. It points forward to interests which are increasingly attracting historians. Meiggs continued to talk of finishing his long projected and much desired book on Herodotus, but ill health prevented him.<br>
<br>Meiggs was one of the great Oxford tutors. Amid growing specialization he taught both Greek and Roman history; he was an authority on Greek epigraphy who worked closely with archaeologists. His striking exterior, the mane of hair, the Aztec profile apparently hewn from some hard wood, the long shorts, and the uniquely shaped grey flannel trousers, made him a magnet for the cameras of tourists, especially as he tramped to and from his allotment with spade and wheelbarrow. His manner, much imitated, was no less individual. Challenging questions were accompanied with a piercing gaze under eyebrows of matchless bushiness, and he loved to disconcert with his rather ferocious geniality. In tutorials he liked pupils to put up a fight. Slipshod argument or carelessness over details did not pass unmauled, but he never had a &#145;line&#146; for pupils to follow, nor a narrow or exclusive conception of history.<br>
<br>Meiggs suffered all his life from the alternation of periods of great elation with others of crippling depression. Physically he was robust and Spartan, famous for rolling in the snow in his bathing costume. He was a gardener, a Christian, a family man; quick to assess people and usually right about them. He did not aspire to promotion, and he published his first important book at the age of fifty-eight, giving his energies without reservation to pupils and college; British universities will see few such careers hereafter. He went his own way, choosing widely different subjects to work on, without regard to fashion.<br>
<br>In some ways a traditionalist, Meiggs welcomed the coming of co-education to Balliol, and he sympathized with the rebellious students of 1968. From 1945 to 1969 he was praefectus of Holywell Manor, the annexe of the college in which most students from overseas lived. He had many connections in North America and was frequently a visiting professor at Swarthmore. Meiggs died on 24 June 1989 at his home, the Malt House, Pettiwell, Garsington, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Meiggs's wife, <a name="cosubject_97088"></a><span class="headword">Pauline Emily Gregg</span>  (1909&#150;2006), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 17 July 1909 in Palmers Green, London, the daughter of Thomas James Nathaniel Gregg, Post Office sorter. She became a socialist while at school, after reading the works of William Morris, and joined the Labour League of Youth and later the Independent Labour Party. She took a short secretarial course at the Pitman's Institute and worked briefly for Longmans, the publishers, and then for the Scottish Office before returning to education at the London School of Economics, where her teachers included Harold Laski and R. H. Tawney. She stayed on to write a thesis (for which she was awarded a PhD in 1939) on John Lilburne, the Leveller; this formed the basis of her later book <span class="italic">Free-born John</span> (1961). In 1939 she was offered a post at Hillcroft College, Surbiton, but the Second World War intervened and she was recruited to work for the Ministry of Supply. After her marriage she combined the role of an Oxford don's wife with her own research and publication (the latter under her maiden name, Pauline Gregg). Her most successful book was <span class="italic">A Social and Economic History of Britain, 1760&#150;1950</span> (1950), which was revised and extended for subsequent editions, the eighth and last appearing in 1982 and taking the story up to 1980. Her other books included a history of the welfare state (1967), a companion volume to her <span class="italic">Social and Economic History</span> entitled <span class="italic">Black Death to Industrial Revolution</span> (1976), and biographies of Charles I (1981) and Oliver Cromwell (1988). Each was well received by academics and general reviewers alike, the <span class="italic">Times</span> reviewer of her <span class="italic">King Charles I</span> commending her &#145;devoted labour&#146; and &#145;evocative turn of phrase&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Oct 1981). She died of a stroke on 11 March 2006 at Abbots Leigh nursing home, Abbots Leigh, Somerset, and was survived by her two daughters.<br>
