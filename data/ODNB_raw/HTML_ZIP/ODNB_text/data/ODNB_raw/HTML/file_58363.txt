<span class="headword">Deane,  Charles Anthony</span>  (1796&#150;1848), <span class="occ">diver and inventor of diving equipment</span>, was born in September 1796 at 53 Hughes Fields, Deptford, Kent, and was baptized at St Nicholas's Church, Deptford, on 2 October 1796, the son of John Deane (<i>bap</i>. 1766, <i>d</i>. 1830), a seaman in the East India Company service, and Eleanor Thompson (1769&#150;1846). The family, although much reduced in circumstances in the nineteenth century, was descended from Sir Anthony Deane (<i>c</i>.1638&#150;1720?), surveyor to the Royal Navy and a friend of Pepys. This seagoing tradition was maintained and as a result of their father's service with the East India Company both Charles and his brother <a name="cosubject_58363"></a><span class="headword">John Deane</span>  (1800&#150;1884)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 6 April 1800 at 53 Hughes Fields, Deptford, and baptized on 2 May 1800 at St Nicholas's Church, Deptford, enjoyed a free education at the Royal Hospital School at Greenwich (now the National Maritime Museum). On leaving (Charles in 1810, John in 1813), both were apprenticed to ship's captains; Charles to a lowly coastal trader, the <i>Ceres</i>, and John, more fortunately, to the famous Captain &#145;Fighting&#146; Tom Larkins of the East Indiaman <i>Warren Hastings</i>.<br>
<br>On completing his apprenticeship, Charles Deane married Sophia McIntosh (1794&#150;1836) on 25 May 1817 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. In 1822 he found work as a caulker at Barnard's shipyard in Deptford, where his father also worked in the same trade. His last two voyages had been aboard the <i>Warren Hastings</i> along with his younger brother, who had recommended him. It is probable that the brothers had benefited from the East India Company custom that allowed those on board to profit from private trade. Charles, who was of an inventive mind, was able to afford to work up the smoke helmet apparatus which he had devised and to patent the design on 4 November 1823. It consisted of a beaten copper helmet with three windows of thick glass, attached to a canvas and leather suit. A supply of air to the helmet was provided by a bellows pump and a second pipe allowed for the escape of the stale air. It is probable that his employer, Edward Barnard, assisted him in the project because some months later he assigned the rights to Barnard for the not inconsiderable sum of &pound;417. The apparatus, demonstrated to several important bodies at home and abroad, was accepted as a useful tool in the days when fire was an ever-present danger in wooden ships and in warehouses and yards storing highly inflammable materials. It was not, however, a commercial success.<br>
<br>Charles's younger brother John had by this time completed his apprenticeship and had found employment with the Thames estuary boatmen from the neighbouring port of Whitstable. This was the centre of an active salvage industry and maintained a flourishing trade in recovering anchors and cargoes in wrecks. It is likely that he took part in bell dives during this work and suffered from the shortcomings of the equipment along with the rest. The principle of the diving bell had been known for centuries but the need for something better was obvious. John Deane had married Agnes Norris (1800&#150;1844) on 9 August 1823, and with a family to support he decided in 1826 to join with his brother to promote and develop the helmet as a diving apparatus. Although in principle it worked in exactly the same way as Smeaton's force pump bell of 1788, the forced air supply helmet's utility lay in its autonomy: it enabled the diver to move freely and work on the sea bed for much longer periods and with comparative ease. This was a tremendous advantage compared with the static nature of the bell.<br>
<br>The adapted &#145;open helmet dress&#146;, as it became known, consisted of the copper helmet with its forced air supply and its heavy glass eyepieces, and stout canvas and leather suit. The used or foul air was now allowed to bubble away at the edge of the breastplate or short jacket. Its major limitation was that the diver was unable to lean too far forward in case the water entered under the breastplate, thereby flooding the suit and helmet. This defect was later rectified by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47441/', "Augustus Siebe")</script> with his &#145;closed dress&#146;.<br>
<br>Charles and John Deane had already met Siebe who lived and worked in Soho, then the centre of the London metal trade, and had been the manufacturer of Charles's original smoke helmet. In 1830, with Barnard, Charles and John decided to entrust the manufacture and marketing of their apparatus to Siebe as he had&#151;or had local access to&#151;all the necessary engineering skills. He improved the apparatus by the addition of a powerful hand-operated cylinder pump and substituted the newly invented Macintosh waterproof indiarubber material for the less effective canvas and leather. The invention was now in the public eye and Siebe sold some twenty suits over the next few years. Its legal owner, Edward Barnard, seemed content to leave it in the hands of the Deanes and Siebe, although its final development into the standard closed dress apparatus was Siebe's alone.<br>
<br>The Deane brothers used the closed dress apparatus on several famous salvage operations, starting with the East Indiaman <i>Carn Brea Castle</i>, lost in August 1829 on the infamous &#145;back of the Wight&#146;. This project was the first commercial use of the apparatus and many others followed, including dives on the <i>Royal George</i> and even on the <i>Mary Rose</i>. The brothers recovered guns and many other artefacts from these famous wrecks. Some from the <i>Royal George</i> were exhibited at 209 Regent Street, London, in 1835. This led to the publication of the first books on helmet diving methods: <span class="italic">Submarine Researches</span> (1835) by Charles and <span class="italic">Method of Using Deane's Patent Diving Apparatus</span> (1836) by John, the world's first helmet diving manual.<br>
<br>It is typical of Charles Deane's difficult and unstable character that in his book, and in general, he refused to acknowledge his brother's contribution to their joint enterprise. John Deane, a far more robust and generous spirit, as his book title suggests, was just the opposite. The brothers finally fell out in 1844 when Charles received a grant from the government of &pound;400 in recognition of his work on the diving dress. He refused to apportion any of the money to John.<br>
<br>Charles, the weaker man physically, gave up his diving activities in 1839 as a possible result of diver's sickness&#151;the bends. Without regular employment he soon fell on hard times. His first wife had died in 1836 and, unable to look after his family of ten children, he was declared insane and confined for a time in Peckham Lunatic Asylum. On 7 November 1845 he married his second wife, Mary Bond (<i>b</i>. 1807). The final tragedy came on 7 November 1848 when, after many setbacks in promoting his other inventions, he cut his throat with a razor and died at 5 Providence Place, Commercial Road, in east London.<br>
<br>John Deane meanwhile continued his successful career as Britain's leading submarine engineer. This led in 1854 to his appointment as chief submarine engineer to the Admiralty in the Crimea to undertake the clearance of wrecks sunk by the Russians to block the entrance to Sevastopol harbour during the Crimean War of 1854&#150;6. He was by this time a widower, his wife having died in August 1844. A family friend in Whitstable, Sarah Ann Browning (1827&#150;1865), took on the job of surrogate mother to his five children and on his return from the Crimea they were married on 7 October 1856 in Whitstable parish church. He had earned a rest from his strenuous labours and decided to retire at the age of fifty-six. He bought several properties in Ramsgate and enjoyed several years of quiet comfort until his death there&#151;at 90 Hardres Street&#151;on 9 July 1884. He had married again, on 10 September 1868; his third wife was his sister-in-law, Ruth Norris (<i>d</i>. 1883).<br>
<br>Although the Deane brothers did not reap the full financial benefit of their simple but brilliant invention and for a time suffered from others taking their glory, they have at last been recognized as pioneers in what is now a considerable industry. Their story was told at length in John Bevan's book <span class="italic">The Infernal Diver</span> (1996), which helped to restore them to their rightful place among the great innovators of the early nineteenth century.<br>
