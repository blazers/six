<span class="headword">Knolles,  Richard</span>  (late 1540s&#150;1610), <span class="occ">historian and translator</span>, was born some time in the late 1540s, probably at Cold Ashby, Northamptonshire, possibly the son of Francis Knolles (or Knowlis) of Cold Ashby. He entered Lincoln College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 24 January 1565, probably in his late teens, and was elected to a fellowship. Remaining at Lincoln in an increasingly senior capacity, he proceeded MA on 4 July 1570, and from the evidence of his signature on college documents stayed there until at least August 1572. In 1576 he is recorded as returning to the college as a visitor. His post-Oxford career of more than thirty years was probably spent almost entirely as headmaster of the grammar school at Sandwich, Kent, founded by Sir Roger Manwood about 1563. In 1568 Manwood had established four scholarships at Lincoln College, two of which were reserved for pupils of his grammar school; he would have met Knolles during the administration of these scholarships. Documentary evidence shows that Knolles was still headmaster of the school in 1606, though he was then being pressed by the governors to retire on a pension due to a perceived lack of diligence in carrying out his teaching duties.<br>
<br>After Sir Roger Manwood's death in 1592, his son Sir Peter became Knolles's patron in both a professional and a literary sense. Acquainted with many of the learned scholars of the period, and subsequently himself a member of the Society of Antiquaries, Sir Peter not only encouraged Knolles to write but was also in a position to obtain for him the loan of books, reports, and other source materials from Robert Cotton and others (BL, Cotton MS Julius C.III, fol. 225, records Knolles's acknowledgement to Cotton). Knolles produced three substantial pieces of work. He is best known for <span class="italic">The Generall Historie of the Turkes</span>, first published in 1603. Compiled from a range of Byzantine and western histories, travellers' reports and letters, together with material from Leunclavius's recent Latin translation of a late fifteenth-century Ottoman chronicle, Knolles's was the first major work on the subject to appear in English, and was quickly recognized as a masterpiece of narrative synthesis. There is no evidence that he had any original personal reason for choosing to write a history of the Ottomans; the suggestion came possibly from Sir Peter Manwood in the light of growing interest in the Ottoman state in London following the chartering in 1581 of the Turkey (subsequently Levant) Company and increased commercial and diplomatic relations with the empire. A second edition appeared in 1610, incorporating both a continuation of the history to 1609 (a total of 1296 folio pages) and, appended to the main narrative, Knolles's fifteen-page &#145;Discourse on the greatnesse of the Ottoman Turkes&#146;, analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the state.<br>
<br>As a compilation Knolles's work is of a piece with the then popular genre of &#145;generall histories&#146; of various countries. It is, however, distinguished by an elegant and compelling style and by Knolles's underlying presentation of Ottoman success as being in large part &#145;the just and secret judgement of the Almightie&#146; in the face of &#145;the smal care the Christian princes &hellip; have had of the common state of the Christian commonweale&#146;. He repeatedly draws attention to the need for Christian unity to combat the Turks successfully, contrasting European disunity with &#145;a rare unitie and agreement&#146; among the Ottomans in both religious and political affairs  (introduction, Knolles, 1631 edn, ii). Subsequent editions in 1621, 1631, and 1638 included continuations by other writers: for 1609&#150;20 by the translator and compiler Edward Grimeston; for 1620&#150;28 based on the dispatches of Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador in Constantinople, and containing translations of Ottoman diplomatic correspondence. The sixth edition of 1687&#150;1700 was brought out by Sir Paul Rycaut, and is particularly valuable for the account of Rycaut's own residency in Constantinople from 1661 to 1667 as secretary to the English ambassador. A two-volume abridgement was issued in 1701 by John Savage. Knolles's literary style was admired by such writers as Johnson, who praises it in no. 122 of <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, and Byron, and the work's reputation as an engrossing account survived well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Knolles's second published work was his translation of Jean Bodin's <span class="italic">La r&eacute;publique</span>, which appeared in 1606 as <span class="italic">The Six Bookes of a Commonweale</span>, dedicated to Sir Peter Manwood. Working critically from both French and Latin originals, Knolles produced not simply a translation but &#145;a work of independent judgement&#146;  (McRae, A38&#150;39) which both illuminated textual difficulties in Bodin's texts and also showed how the latter's work could be understood by a near-contemporary English reader. No doubt it was in aid of such understanding that Knolles chose to translate <i>r&eacute;publique</i> as &#145;commonweale&#146;, a term with familiar associations in England. Bodin's absolutist treatise was influential in seventeenth-century England, especially among royalists; however, Knolles's translation of it was not reprinted after 1606, which suggests it had only a limited role in circulating the Frenchman's ideas.<br>
<br>Knolles's third major undertaking was an unpublished translation from the Latin original of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. This survives in the Bodleian Library (MS Ashmole 849), but remains little known. Knolles died in Sandwich and was buried there in St Mary's Church on 2 July 1610. He is not known to have married.<br>
