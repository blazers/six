<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morfill,  William Richard</span>  (1834&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Slavonic languages scholar</span>, was born on 17 November 1834 at Maidstone, Kent, the second of the three children of William Morfill (1807&#150;<i>c</i>.1870), a professional musician, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1816&#150;1836), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Couchman. The Morfills are thought to have been of Huguenot origin, but William was baptized into the Church of England, together with his sister and younger brother, at All Saints' Church, Maidstone, on 26 October 1838. He was educated at Maidstone grammar school and (from 1848) at Tonbridge School. On 28 May 1853, with a scholarship from his school, he entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as a commoner, but migrated on 5 December of that year to Oriel College on election to an open classical scholarship there. In Michaelmas term 1855 he was placed in the first class in classical moderations, but during finals (<i>literae humaniores</i>) in 1857 he was taken seriously ill, had to retire from the examination, and was awarded only a pass degree. This seemed to be the end of his aspirations for an academic career, but he stayed on in Oxford, supporting himself by giving private tuition from his rooms in Oriel Street. On 6 September 1860, in the parish church of St Martin, Welton, Northamptonshire, he was married to Charlotte Maria (<i>d</i>. 1881), the daughter of Thomas Lee of Welton, a grazier. They had no children. By 1863 he was living with his wife at 4 Clarendon Villas, Park Town, Oxford, and from 1865 to 1869 he was a lecturer in philosophy and modern history at Charsley's Hall (one of the Oxford private halls).<br>
<br>A precocious interest in exotic languages and the gift of a Russian grammar from one of his teachers at Tonbridge led Morfill to apply himself seriously to the study of Russian. His first published translations from that language date from 1860, and in 1870 he made the first of many visits to Russia. He also learned other Slavonic languages and travelled to the countries where they were spoken; his first visit to Prague took place in 1871. He soon acquired a reputation as an expert in Slavonic languages, a subject which until 1870 was not represented at any British university. On 8 June that year he was appointed by the University of Oxford to give the first series of lectures in accordance with the provisions of the newly endowed Ilchester Foundation for the encouragement of the study of Slavonic languages. He still had no permanent appointment, but he was engaged to give further Ilchester lectures in 1873 and 1883. The substance of some of these lectures was published in his <span class="italic">Dawn of European Literature: Slavonic Literature</span> (1883).<br>
<br>His wife's early death in 1881 was a blow from which Morfill never fully recovered, but he sought solace in his work. About this time regular gatherings of his friends began to take place on Sunday afternoons at his house in Clarendon Villas for learned and literary conversation. The 1880s saw the appearance of Morfill's grammars of Polish (1884), Serbian (1887), and Russian (1889), though his command of languages extended beyond the Slavonic field. He also turned his attention to Georgian and, following a visit to Georgia in 1888, he wrote a well-informed article on Georgian literature for <span class="italic">The Academy</span> (21 July 1888). Official recognition came late. It was only in December 1889 that the university appointed him reader in Russian and the other Slavonic languages, and it was not until 1900, when he was sixty-six years old, that he was promoted to professor. He had meanwhile added to his publications a history of Russia (1890), a history of Poland (1893), and grammars of Bulgarian (1897) and Czech (1899). From 1890 he was a corresponding member of the Kr&aacute;lovsk&aacute; &#268;esk&aacute; Spole&#269;nost nauk (&#145;Royal Czech Society of Sciences&#146;) and, from 1905, of the &#268;esk&aacute; akademie c&iacute;sa&#345;e Franti&#353;ka Josefa pro V&#283;dy, slovesnost a Um&#283;n&iacute; (&#145;Francis Joseph Czech Academy for Sciences, Literature, and Arts&#146;). He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1903 and in July 1908 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Charles University, Prague.<br>
<br>Believing that the account of the Slavs fed to the British public was tainted by German prejudice, Morfill saw himself as an enlightener, but, though he claimed that his own work was without bias, he had a distinctly Russian view of Slavonic brotherhood. In 1904 Russian became a full degree subject at Oxford. The university's approval of the languages he had cultivated while they lay outside the curriculum is Morfill's most enduring achievement. He had a genial personality and was renowned for the charm of his conversation. Even while he was an undergraduate &#145;the epigrammatic vigour of his sentences&#146;  (Murray, 369) was noted. He was good-looking but had a squint, which he endeavoured to hide, when drawn or photographed, by appearing in profile. Before he reached his sixtieth birthday he was bald on top and had grown a full beard to replace the whiskers he had worn as a young man. He died of old age and a weak heart at 4 Clarendon Villas, Park Town, on 9 November 1909. The first part of the funeral service was held at the church of St Philip and St James, Oxford, and he was buried in the same grave as his wife in St Sepulchre's cemetery, Walton Street, Oxford, on 13 November.<br>
