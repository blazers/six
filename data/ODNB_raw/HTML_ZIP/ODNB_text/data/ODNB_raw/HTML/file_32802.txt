<span class="headword">Devlin,  Joseph</span>  (1871&#150;1934), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and politician</span>, was born at 10 Hamill Street, in the lower Falls area of Belfast, on 13 February 1871. He was the fifth child of Charles Devlin (<i>d</i>. 1906), a jarvey (hackney cab owner), and his wife, Eliza King (<i>d</i>. 1902), an illiterate who sold groceries from the house; rural migrants and Roman Catholics, they had married in Belfast in 1858. Until he was twelve Devlin attended the nearby Christian Brothers' schools, where the curriculum presented a more &#145;national&#146; view of Ireland's history and culture than was offered by the diocesan schools or the state system. After a brief period as a clerk, concerning which he later alleged discrimination, he worked in a pub. He showed an early aptitude for public speaking, becoming chairman of a debating society formed in 1886 to commemorate the first nationalist election victory in West Belfast. Between 1891 and 1893 he was a journalist on the <span class="italic">Irish News</span> and the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>. He then managed a Belfast pub for the nationalist MP Sam Young, which sustained him until he became a full-time politician in 1902, affording him the flexible working conditions needed to organize the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation in eastern Ulster. Notwithstanding nationalist reunion in 1900 Devlin's local party remained in bitter conflict until 1905 with the bishop's Catholic Association, which wanted city politics to be based on Catholic rights and episcopal leadership rather than nationalism. In 1901 his aspiration was still to acquire a pub in Glasgow or London as the base for a future political career. His early experiences convinced Devlin that priests and publicans, properly managed, could underpin nationalist organization in a way that class-based or cross-communal appeals could not.<br>
<br>In 1902 Devlin's career took off: the Irish party sent him to Irish America on the first of many successful fund-raising tours; in February he entered parliament unopposed following a by-election in Kilkenny North; and on his return he accepted a paid position in the nationalist movement (which he once vowed he would never do) as London-based secretary of the United Irish League of Great Britain (UIL), moving in 1905 to Dublin as general secretary. Devlin's special skills lay in the arousal and organization of minority and emigrant nationalists, initially in Belfast and Glasgow. Thus the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) came to interest him. The AOH was a benefit society for Irish American Catholics; it also existed in Ireland and Britain, but was discouraged by the Catholic church because of its paraphernalia of oaths and secrecy, although these practices resembled modern freemasonry more than any traditional secret society. Devlin encountered the order's power in America in 1902&#150;3, and on return set out to claim it for constitutional nationalism. From 1905 until his death he was national president of the AOH &#145;board of Erin&#146;, developing it as a grass-roots movement under his personal control, but in harness with the UIL: it was attractive to nationalists with no interest in land agitation, to small businessmen seeking advantage, and to workers seeking insurance benefits. The AOH continued the O'Connellite link between Catholicism and nationalism, but through an organization under lay control. To the Irish party's opponents, both nationalist and unionist, the order was symptomatic of the party's corruption, jobbery, and Catholic exclusivism.<br>
<br>After the 1906 general election Devlin sat for West Belfast, which he regained from the Unionists by sixteen votes. He became a distinguished parliamentarian, though his best oratorical performances continued to be on the public platform. He took up labour issues effectively, especially conditions in the linen mills and sweating in the textile trades. He came to parliamentary prominence after 1910, when home rule dominated politics: Winston Churchill thought him &#145;the one new figure of distinction in the Irish Party&#146;  (R. S. Churchill, <span class="italic">Winston Spencer Churchill</span>, 2, companion, pt 2, 1969, 1035). Conservatives feared that he would oppose compromise on Ulster, but loyalty to the party leadership remained his touchstone. He followed John Redmond in supporting wartime recruiting. After Easter 1916 he procured for the party a self-denying ordinance from nationalist Ulster to assist Lloyd George's abortive home rule negotiations, organizing a convention which endorsed temporary six-county exclusion from home rule by a vote of 475 to 265. Although his reputation never entirely recovered from this episode Devlin easily retained his Belfast seat in 1918, against Eamon de Valera of Sinn F&eacute;in, when elsewhere the Irish party was annihilated. Never again did he go out on a political limb: in the Irish convention of 1918 he sided with the bishops in blocking Redmond's compromise with the southern unionists over customs; during the 1919&#150;22 period, reduced to the leadership of six MPs, he avoided any policy involvement, believing that the popular mandate had passed to Sinn F&eacute;in.<br>
<br>Partition left Devlin in depressed personal and political circumstances. He ruled out escape into southern politics; he lost West Belfast through boundary changes in October 1922, when he also failed to become Independent Labour MP for Liverpool Exchange. In 1929 he was returned for Tyrone and Fermanagh, but made little impact. He was elected to the new parliament of Northern Ireland in 1921, and led his small party out of abstention in 1925. In 1928, at the instigation of former pro-treaty Sinn F&eacute;iner Cahir Healy, he founded the National League of the North, an attempt to create a united and formally structured nationalist movement in Northern Ireland, drawing in all but the irreconcilable IRA element, but the movement had expired by the time of his death. He won amendments to the <span class="roman">Northern Ireland Education Act</span> of 1930 which improved the funding of Catholic schools, but these were years of demoralization for northern Catholics, and his party abstained after 1932.<br>
<br>Devlin was a small man, known affectionately as Wee Joe by his constituents. Though sneeringly dubbed the &#145;duodecimo Demosthenes&#146; by T. M. Healy he was a charming and effervescent personality, and widely loved. For twenty-five years his existence was nomadic and, like one in four of his Irish male contemporaries, he never married. He spent much of his leisure time with priests and with families, where he was especially popular with children. He organized seaside &#145;days of delight&#146; for thousands of Belfast children, and in 1920 opened a holiday hotel in Bangor for mill girls. Though nervous he was a fluent and powerful orator. One contemporary characterized his approach as &#145;getting there&#146;, without too much concern as to the destination  (F. Cruise O'Brien in <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, 19 Feb 1910): the archetypal party secretary, his energies were devoted less to the formulation than to the implementation of policy. Devlin acquired the image of a political &#145;boss&#146; in some quarters, and critics alleged that he surrounded himself with people less sincere and dedicated than he was. Perhaps because for so much of his career he served a leadership which was superior in both age and social status, and which to some extent patronized him, he tended in turn to surround himself with sycophants rather than with challenging or innovative minds. Arising from his formative experience during the Parnell split, party loyalty became a prime characteristic of his own career, and a quality which he perhaps prized too greatly in others.<br>
<br>Devlin's main residence was in Belfast with his parents until 1902; then in London and Dublin; then, during the First World War, alongside professionals at 3 College Square North, Belfast; and, after 1926, at Ard-Righ, 362 Antrim Road, Belfast, formerly the home of F. J. Bigger. In later years he was comfortably off, as a director of the Distillers Company and chairman of the <span class="italic">Irish News</span>. He died at St John's Nursing Home, Belfast, on 18 January 1934 of a gastric haemorrhage, following several years of failing health. He was buried at Milltown cemetery, Belfast, two days later. His funeral at St Peter's Pro-Cathedral, Belfast, was attended by leading members of both Irish governments.<br>
