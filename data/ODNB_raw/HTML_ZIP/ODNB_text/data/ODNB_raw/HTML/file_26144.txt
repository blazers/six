<span class="headword">Spens,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1415&#150;1480), <span class="occ">diplomat and bishop of Aberdeen</span>, was the third son of John Spens of Glen Douglas and Lathallan and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir John Wemyss. Having allegedly been educated in Edinburgh in the 1430s, he took his first steps in a long diplomatic career when on 16 December 1439 he was granted a safe conduct by Henry VI to go to England. He also came to hold a number of church offices; by 10 June 1444 he was archdeacon of Moray, and he was appointed to the positions of apostolic protonotary and succentor of Moray by the following year. In the late 1440s, in an ambassadorial role, Spens was instrumental in opening the negotiations which secured the eventual marriage of James II to Mary of Gueldres, niece of the duke of Burgundy. His provision to the bishopric of Galloway, which took place on 8 January 1450, had the effect of placing a loyal king's man in an area of Black Douglas influence.<br>
<br>Spens was sent by James II on an embassy to Charles VII of France in 1450 and was in turn commissioned by the French king to urge James II's support for Henry VI of England against Richard of York. In the crucial period of tension between James II and the Black Douglases, Spens gave consistent support to the king. He attended the parliament held in July 1451, at which William, eighth earl of Douglas, resigned and received formal regrants of his possessions. Spens was in Newcastle by 24 August, when a three-year truce between Scotland and England was ratified, but he was back in Scotland by 1 September; he appeared then with the king at Falkland, and he witnessed a number of royal charters throughout the winter. He was with James as late as January 1452, shortly before the king killed the earl of Douglas on 22 February. As bishop of Galloway, Spens was the senior churchman in the heartland of Black Douglas influence, but his loyalty to the king appears to have been unwavering. James II sent him to France to explain in person the king's position regarding the Black Douglases, just before the forfeiture of the family in 1455.<br>
<br>Spens was received at Bourges on 19 May 1455, and was largely engaged in diplomatic activity on the continent until 1458. He was present when the betrothal between James II's sister Annabella and Count Louis of Geneva, arranged in 1444, was formally broken off in 1456. Between 30 January 1458 and 18 April 1459 Spens held the office of keeper of the privy seal. When Ingram Lindsay, bishop of Aberdeen, died on 24 August 1458, Spens was translated from Galloway to Aberdeen before 15 December, and it was as bishop of Aberdeen that on 16 April 1459 he witnessed a charter by Mary of Gueldres, in which she founded the collegiate church of the Holy Trinity, Edinburgh. On 2 June 1460 Spens received a safe conduct for himself and Andrew Durisdeer, bishop of Glasgow, to go to England on matters concerning the existing truce, but the overthrow of the Lancastrian dynasty on 10 July resulted in turmoil and the renewal of Anglo-Scottish hostilities, in the course of which James II was killed.<br>
<br>Spens was mainly occupied with the business of his diocese during the following year, although he was part of a Scottish embassy once more by 24 September 1461. A safe conduct for one year was issued to him by Edward IV on 25 June 1463, but in spite of this Spens, in company with Alexander, duke of Albany, James III's younger brother, was captured on a return voyage from Bruges in an act of piracy by an English barge and subsequently held captive in England. This had occurred before 8 July 1464, and Spens was not released until the next year; he appeared back at court on 2 July 1465. His detention was designed by Edward IV to exert pressure on the Scots to abandon support for the Lancastrian cause, and the bishop was set free once proposals for a truce, including the projected marriage of James III to an English bride, were put forward. He was sufficiently in favour with Edward IV to receive from that king a large annuity and several gifts.<br>
<br>Spens was involved in the Stirling agreement of April 1468, whereby the Boyds attempted to secure acceptance for their recent elevation; however, the forfeiture of the family in November 1469 rendered the document ineffective. Upon the death of James Lindsay in 1468 Spens resumed the office of keeper of the privy seal, and appears to have been unaffected by the fall of the Boyds. By 12 June 1469 he had returned from another diplomatic mission to England, in time for the marriage of James III to Margaret of Denmark on 13 July. On 17 August 1472 St Andrews was erected into a metropolitan see, with Patrick Graham as the first archbishop. Spens then petitioned Pope Sixtus IV for exemption from metropolitan jurisdiction for the diocese of Aberdeen during his own lifetime, and received a papal bull granting this on 14 February 1474.<br>
<br>Spens became embroiled in a protracted dispute over compensation claimed from the English for the seizure of Bishop Kennedy's barge, the <i>Salvator</i>, which was wrecked near Bamburgh in March 1473. The issue was settled on 25 October 1474 and on 3 February 1475 Spens took payment of 500 marks on behalf of the Scots merchants whose goods had been plundered. Negotiations for a marriage between Prince James of Scotland and Edward IV's daughter Cecilia saw Spens playing a central role in the preliminary discussions on 25 June 1474, but he was not present when the negotiations were concluded in October 1475.<br>
<br>Spens was assiduous as a witness to royal charters and was a constant member of the committee of the articles throughout the 1470s. But the fact that he does not appear to have engaged in diplomacy after the mid-1470s may indicate that his health was now declining. He made a number of gifts and improvements to St Machar's Cathedral in Aberdeen, and fortified the bishop's palace as well. He also founded St Mary's Hospital in Leith shortly before his death, which took place in Edinburgh on 15 April 1480. Spens was buried on the following day in the collegiate church of the Holy Trinity, whose foundation he had witnessed twenty-one years earlier.<br>
