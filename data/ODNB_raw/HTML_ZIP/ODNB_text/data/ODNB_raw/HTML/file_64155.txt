<span class="headword">Machtig, Sir  Eric Gustav Siegfried</span>  (1889&#150;1973), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 21 August 1889 at 46 Merton Road, Wimbledon, the son of Friedrich Gustav M&auml;chtig, a professor of music, and his wife, Pauline Petronella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schneider. Both parents were German born.<br>
<br>After attending St Paul's School, London, where he was a scholar, Machtig proceeded (also as a scholar) to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first-class degree (second division) in the classical tripos in 1911. He entered the Colonial Office in October 1912 where he worked in the east African department and then in the Tanganyika and Somaliland department. He was promoted to first-class clerk in 1917 and was made a principal in 1920. In 1930 he transferred to the Dominions Office as assistant secretary. In 1934 he became head of the department dealing with the high commission territories in southern Africa and in 1936 rose to be assistant under-secretary. In 1939 he felt slighted when, despite being next in line, he was not made permanent under-secretary. He served as acting permanent under-secretary until Sir Cosmo Parkinson arrived from the Colonial Office on 1 February 1940, at which time Machtig was given the newly invented title of deputy under-secretary. However, in May 1940 Parkinson was recalled to the Colonial Office and Machtig succeeded him.<br>
<br>Machtig was a pragmatic, honourable, clear-thinking man who cultivated his ministers. He was good at administration. But he was also conservative in all senses, disliked change and, although his placatory instinct was valuable in maintaining reasonable relations with &Eacute;ire during the Second World War, he was unsuited to head the Dominions Office at a time of rapid transition in the Commonwealth. Moreover, his shyness and dislike of mixing with (or even seeing) people prevented him networking effectively in Whitehall or establishing close relations with dominion leaders and their representatives. He ran the Dominions Office in the manner of a remote, authoritarian Victorian father, centralizing work in his own hands and projecting his own meticulous ways in sometimes petty bureaucratic procedures. Even the war could not alter his office routine: at 5 p.m. prompt he retreated to catch the train to the wartime haven in Peaslake, Surrey, that he shared with his aged mother. After his marriage on 22 March to Nora Marguerite Friend (1892/3&#150;1943) of North Cray, Kent, the 48-year-old daughter of a merchant, his wife also shared this house. However, she fell seriously ill in 1942 and died in 1943. Utterly desolate, Machtig retreated further into himself and his rigidities became more marked.<br>
<br>When the Dominions Office and the India Office were merged into the new Commonwealth Relations Office in 1947, they initially remained in most respects separate departments under one roof, with Machtig retaining his old responsibilities and having little to do with the Asian side under its permanent under-secretary, Sir Archibald Carter. To bring the office together called for someone with an outgoing personality, organizational drive, readiness to innovate, and (preferably) experience of working overseas. Added to this, Machtig proved incompatible with Philip Noel-Baker, the secretary of state appointed to take charge of the new ministry. After much resistance Machtig left the Commonwealth Relations Office on assignment for special duties in December 1948. He retired in 1949. He was appointed MBE in 1918, OBE in 1926, CMG in 1935, KCMG in 1939, KCB in 1943, and GCMG in 1948.<br>
<br>Machtig had a satisfying retirement and particularly enjoyed travelling as a director of Barclay's Bank (DCO) from 1949 to 1969. He chaired the working committee of the Lord Mayor's National Thanksgiving Fund in 1950, was chairman of the Sister Trust from 1950 to 1965, and a vice-chairman of the Victoria League from 1950 to 1962.<br>
<br>Machtig was of average height and fair complexion. He presented an overall impression of roundedness with, owing to his thick glasses, an owlish look. He spoke clearly but sounded as if he had catarrh. He was a keen musician, a skilful violinist, and an enthusiastic and competent squash player. He died, childless, of cerebral thrombosis at his home, 11 Belvedere Drive, Wimbledon, on 24 July 1973.<br>
