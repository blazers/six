<span class="headword">Sherburne, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, was baptized with his twin brother John on 27 September 1616 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, the son of Edward Sherburne (1578&#150;1641), government official and secretary of the East India Company, and his wife, Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. 1673), the daughter of John Stanley of Roydon Hall, Essex, and his wife, Beatrix. His grandfather Henry Sherburne, a descendant of Sir Richard Sherburne of Stonyhurst, Lancashire, had grown prosperous from modest beginnings as a groom at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was the elder of the twins, and there were four other children in the family.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyyears"></a>Education and early years</h2>The family lived in Goldsmith's Rents, where Sherburne's schoolmaster, as he recalled to Anthony Wood in 1686, was the famous classicist Thomas Farnaby:<blockquote>about the yeare 1624; I began as I may truly call it my Ludus literarius, for I began very early, and by Reason of the Neighbourhood of my Fathers House, being joyned to the Backside of M<sup>r</sup>. Farnabyes, us'd to play among the schollars in long Coats. I continued till the Yeare 1634. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood F.44, fol. 272<i>r</i>)</blockquote>At that time Farnaby moved out of London, and his assistant, the poet Charles Aleyn, became Sherburne's private tutor. Other writers of Sherburne's acquaintance included Thomas Carew, Robert Herrick, Thomas May, Thomas Randolph, and James Shirley. On 5 February 1638 the king granted Sherburne the reversion of his father's clerkship of the office of ordnance.<br>
<br>Sherburne wrote a prefatory poem for Aleyn's verse <span class="italic">Historie</span> of Henry VII (1638) and another for Ovid's <span class="italic">Heroical Epistles</span> (1639), translated by his brother John, who died the following year. His father:<blockquote>thought fitt for my better Education to send Me abroad to travell. I sett forward just at Xmas 1640 and continued abroad till the End of (41) haveing spent my Time in viewing a considerable Part of France; and was intended for a Journey into Italy, but then unfortunately calld back by Occasion of my Fathers Sicknesse, who not many Weeks after my Returne dyed some few Dayes before Xmas in the End of (41). (MS Wood F.44, fol. 272<i>v</i>)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Civilwar"></a>Civil war</h2>Sherburne succeeded his father at a difficult time for the ordnance officers: on 17 August 1642 the House of Lords committed them to custody for refusing to issue munitions without the king's warrant. On 9 September they were ordered to be freed but not restored to their positions. Six days later Sherburne's mother, &#145;having Two Sons usually living with her, who are now with the King&#146;, was ordered to be removed from their house in the Tower  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 1642&#150;3, 448). Sherburne served Charles at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October, and on 22 November the king, holding a council of war at Reading, sent him and others with ordnance to Oxford. He was styled commissary, and his brother Henry (killed in 1646) initially worked in the Oxford ordnance office too. On 20 December both were admitted MA by the king's special command.<br>
<br>Eventually, after the battle of Naseby on 14 May 1645, hostilities moved west and the Oxford ordnance office was reduced until its members &#145;were gathered by Sherburne himself into an ordinary troop, which was allowed to remain as part of the garrison&#146;  (Roy, 1.57). After Oxford's surrender in the following June, he moved back to London, where he lived for some time in the Middle Temple chambers of his cousin John Povey. There he became friends with a more distant relative, Thomas Stanley, for whose <span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span> (1647) he wrote commendatory verses and also (in some copies) &#145;Epithalamion&#146; on Stanley's marriage. The following year Sherburne published his verse translations of Seneca's <span class="italic">Medea</span> and <span class="italic">Answer to Lucilius his quaere; why good men suffer misfortunes seeing there is a divine providence?</span> He dedicated and presented the latter to &#145;<i>the King of Sorrows</i>&#146;, Charles I, who might perceive in it &#145;a glympse of Your own invincible <i>Patience</i> and inimitable <i>Magna[ni]mity</i>; in bearing and ever-mastering <i>Mis-fortunes</i>&#146;  (sigs. A2<i>v</i>&#150;3<i>r</i>). Sherburne tactfully omitted the concluding lines, &#145;being a Stoicall Exhortation to the Anticipation of Death&#146;  (ibid., 30).<br>
<br>After Charles's execution Sherburne shared Stanley's retirement in the country homes of the latter's family at Cumberlow Green, Hertfordshire, and parents-in-law at Flower, Northamptonshire. Stanley encouraged his studying French and Italian poets, who are well represented in Sherburne's collection, dedicated to Stanley, <span class="italic">Poems and Translations Amorous, Lusory, Morall, Divine</span> (1651). These are virtually all translations; indeed, &#145;Sherburne can hardly be credited with having written original poems at all&#146;  (Praz, 290). They have value, however, as evidence of literary fashion. The same year he contributed a commendatory poem to William Cartwright's posthumous <span class="italic">Comedies; Tragi-Comedies, with other Poems</span>.<h2>
<a name="TranslatingManilius"></a>Translating Manilius</h2>When young Sir George Savile (later marquess of Halifax) returned from his travels, Sherburne later wrote, &#145;about the years 1651 or 1652 I was invited to tak upon Me the Charge of his Concernes&#146;  (MS Wood F.44, fol. 273<i>r</i>). Sherburne has been identified with the Saviles' steward of the same name at Rufford, Northamptonshire, who was involved in an intended insurrection in March 1655. Sir George's mother recommended Sherburne &#145;to undertake the Tuition of her Nephew Sr: Jo: Coventry in his Travells abroad&#146;, setting out at the beginning of that same month and, &#145;Haveing run through All France, Italy, some Part of Hungary, the Greater Part of Germany, Holland, and the Rest of the low Countries, and Flandres, returning Home about the End of October 1659&#146;  (MS Wood F.44, fol. 273<i>r</i>). In Europe, Sherburne conversed with learned men and at Paris in September 1656 began work on Manilius.<br>
<br>Sherburne preserved the ordnance records during his sequestration. On 17 May 1660 he and the storekeeper Richard Marsh petitioned the House of Lords to restore them to their places; but a counter-claim by the incumbents frustrated them until they successfully petitioned the privy council, probably in June. Subsequently Sherburne asked the Council for &#145;943<i>l</i>. 9<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. owing to his late father, as clerk of the Ordnance in 1641, and for much larger arrears due to himself as his successor, to enable him to pay his father's debts&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 229). He was disappointed by a pension of only &pound;100; but he worked hard and conscientiously, remaining at his post throughout the great plague of 1665. He served on the commission for saltpetre in 1666.<br>
<br>Sherburne shared an interest in astronomy with the surveyor-general of the ordnance, Sir Jonas Moore, and the treasurer, George Wharton. Sherburne's <span class="italic">Sphere of Marcus Manilius Made an English Poem</span> (1675) was long in preparation and printing; it translated the first of the <span class="italic">Astronomica</span>'s five books, &#145;with ample notes displaying a wide reading but no great acuteness or alertness of mind&#146;  (Housman, 1.xv). Sherburne advertised this attractively illustrated folio as an initiation for young gentlemen &#145;in the first Rudiments of Sphericall Learning&#146;  (MS Wood F.44, fol. 273<i>r</i>). The catalogue of &#145;the most eminent astronomers, ancient &amp; modern&#146; attracted particular attention. He next published another translation of Seneca: <span class="italic">Troades: or the Royal Captives</span> (1679). Nahum Tate's collection <span class="italic">Poems, by Several Hands and on Several Occasions</span> (1685) included &#145;The Graces, or Hieron&#146;, translated by Sherburne from Theocritus &#145;above forty years ago&#146;  (p. 151).<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeanddeath"></a>Later life and death</h2>On 6 January 1683 Charles II knighted Sherburne:<blockquote>in consideration of his great sufferings, and the long and faithful services by him performed &hellip; having also suffered several indignities from the faction at the time of the Popish Plot, who endeavoured to out him of his Place, for being, as they supposed, a Rom. Cath. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.19)</blockquote>The Sherburne family was known for recusancy&#151;notably the Stonyhurst branch&#151;but Sherburne is said only to have &#145;turn'd Roman Catholick in King <i>Charles</i> II's time&#146;  (Boyer, 232). He had taken the oaths required by the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in 1673. (Several Catholic items appear in his library catalogue of 1670&#151;now BL, Sloane MS 857, fols. 182&#150;94.) He remained financially insecure: on 7 December 1686 his petition for &#145;the arrears of his patent fees, amounting to 720<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., out of the rebels' estate in the West&#146; was referred to the lord treasurer  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1686&#150;7</i>, 315); and a year later he hoped Anthony Wood might find him a college lease, for which a relative was providing him a lump sum.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1688 Wood dined with Sherburne, who told him &#145;he had received orders to give out ammunition and armes for the ships and several seaport townes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 3.276). When King James had to replace the Tower's lieutenant, Sherburne wrote on 4 December, &#145;We are like to fare yet worse, for Orange they say demands the Towre to be deliverd up to him, trusting in that more then a free Parliam<sup>t</sup>&#146;  (MS Wood F.44, fol. 285<i>r</i>). A week later he informed Lord Dartmouth, master-general of the ordnance, &#145;this morning the Lord Lucas, now Lieutenant of the Tower, showed me a warrant from the Lords Spiritual and Temporal for removing me, as a Roman Catholic, out of the Tower&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 3.136). After initially objecting, he complied. On 18 January 1689 he begged Dartmouth to let Thomas Townsend deputize and himself retain the clerkship's profits, but in August, after he refused to take the oath and declaration, his successor was sworn in.<br>
<br>Sherburne planned further translations but completed only one: <span class="italic">The Comparison of Pindar and Horace</span> (1696) from the French of Fran&ccedil;ois Blondel. He lent Richard Bentley, who was editing Manilius, materials collected by Jean-Gaspard Gevaerts, from which Bentley sent a tract by Albert Rubens to Johann Georg Graevius for publication. Bentley's enemies at Christ Church, Oxford, however, published Sherburne's complaint that Graevius had acknowledged Bentley instead of himself; Bentley fully explained the matter in his revised <span class="italic">Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris</span> (1699). By this time Sherburne was impoverished: on 27 January 1698 he petitioned the crown for some of &pound;1048 10<i>s</i>. owing to him &#145;that he may pay his debts and be relieved from his starving condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1698</i>, 53). On 9 April he was allowed &pound;100 &#145;in consideration of [his] great age and distressed condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 187). Similar petitions and grants followed in 1699, 1701, and 1702.<br>
<br>In 1701 Sherburne reflected, &#145;tis in vaine to strive / To play the Poet well at Eighty five&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 829, fol. 2<i>v</i>). He did, however, publish his collected translations of Seneca's <span class="italic">Tragedies</span> (1702), adding <span class="italic">Phaedra and Hippolytus</span> and reprinting <span class="italic">The Rape of Helen</span> from his collection of 1651. In his prefatory &#145;Brief discourse concerning translation&#146; he strikes an old-fashioned note defending his &#145;close Adherence&#146; to the words of the original&#151;obviously a response to Dryden's practice and theory. But Sherburne's verse, accomplished and often elegantly phrased, had rarely shown the independence of mind that distinguishes the best seventeenth-century poetry, even some of his friend Stanley's. He dedicated the <span class="italic">Tragedies</span> to young Richard Francis Sherburne of Stonyhurst, Sir Nicholas's son, in gratitude for his family's &#145;many Favours&#146;. On 4 November 1702 he died, probably at Holborn, and was buried four days later in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London, towards the east end, on the north side near the wall. Although he composed an inscription for Sir Nicholas to use, a memorial tablet was placed there only in 1912. No will survives, nor record of his having married. Sir Hans Sloane, who had known him, bought some of his manuscripts.<br>
