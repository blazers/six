<span class="headword">Craig,  Stella  Ross-</span>  (1906&#150;2006), <span class="occ">botanical artist</span>, was born on 19 March 1906 at 61 Gordon Road, Aldershot, Hampshire, one of the three children of John Ross Craig, pharmacist, and his wife, Christina Sinclair, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lauder. Both her parents were Scottish. On her birth certificate her father signed himself J. Ross Craig, and by the time of her marriage she had added a hyphen. During her childhood in Hampshire and Kent her father, who was an amateur botanist, stimulated her interest in flowers, and her brother encouraged her to draw. After her mother's early death she left school at the age of fourteen to look after the family home. At eighteen she undertook a course lasting four years at Thanet Art School, where she studied life drawing, print-making, photography, and embroidery. At the same time she attended evening classes on botany. She subsequently extended her botanical knowledge at the Chelsea Polytechnic but took no qualification. There she met Joseph Robert Sealy, known as J. Robert Sealy (1907&#150;2000), a fellow student, and son of Joseph Sealy, a sergeant in Kew Gardens constabulary; they eventually married on 24 October 1936. Sealy had entered the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew about 1925. Two years later he was transferred to the Kew herbarium to assist Otto Stapf, botanist and editor of <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span> published floral paintings, especially those of horticultural appeal. In 1929 it engaged Stella Ross-Craig as a botanical artist; it is not clear whether her future husband played any part in this appointment. The Royal Horticultural Society, which owned the periodical, paid her salary but she reported to Stapf at Kew Gardens. (She was never a member of Kew's staff.) Her first drawing was published in 1932, lithographed by Lilian Snelling, at that time the periodical's principal artist. From 1935 the floral dissections that accompanied every illustration were transferred to the text pages as line drawings, and most of them were executed by Ross-Craig. She succeeded Snelling when the latter retired in 1952 and was joined by Ann Webster (whom she claimed to have trained) and later by Margaret Stones as fellow artists. When her last painting was published in 1980, she had contributed 333 plant portraits to the magazine.<br>
<br>In 1932 the Bentham-Moxon Trust at Kew Gardens employed Ross-Craig to produce line drawings for <span class="italic">Hooker's Icones Plantarum</span>, a periodical that Sir William Hooker had founded in 1837. Originally it had selected new or rare specimens from Hooker's personal herbarium, but it was now portraying species in the Kew herbarium. By 1956 Ross-Craig had drawn 397 plates, which included 25 for a small monograph that she compiled, <span class="italic">A Revision of the Genus Sphaeranthus</span> (1955). She also produced 50 line drawings for W. B. Turrill's <span class="italic">Studies in the Genus Fritillaria</span>, which was completed by her husband after Turrill's death. It appeared as a separate issue of <span class="italic">Hooker's Icones Plantarum</span> in 1980.<br>
<br>Through her contributions to <span class="italic">Hooker's Icones Plantarum</span> Ross-Craig perfected her skill as a black and white illustrator and was ready to contemplate her <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">Drawings of British Plants</span>. It was to be a compendium of British native species, excluding Gramineae (grasses) and Cyperaceae (sedges), which other publications had adequately covered. She was not the first to conceive of such a project. W. H. Fitch had produced <span class="italic">Illustrations of the British Flora</span> (1880) as a companion to George Bentham's <span class="italic">Handbook of the British Flora</span>. Its small line drawings, four to a page, in a portable form, deserved their popularity with the general public, but they lacked detail. Much more in accord with Ross-Craig's concept was Roger W. Butcher's <span class="italic">Further Illustrations of British plants</span> (1930), with competent line drawings by Florence E. Strudwick.<br>
<br>Ross-Craig planned a line drawing of every species incorporating magnified dissections of its flower and fruit. She emulated the woodcuts in medieval herbals by occasionally including roots whenever they were a pertinent diagnostic detail. Charles Hubbard, a Kew botanist, encouraged her, and the director, Sir Edward Salisbury, introduced her to the publisher George Bell &amp; Son. The publisher chose good quality paper to facilitate hand colouring by the purchaser. The first part appeared in 1948 and during the next 25 years she produced, on average, about two drawings a week, amounting to 1316 full-page plates in 31 parts. Her husband and their friend Bill Burtt joined her in collecting specimens, members of the Botanical Society of the British Isles volunteered to find rare species, and dried specimens in the Kew herbarium were consulted. Her husband, Burtt, and Noel Sandwith, a Kew botanist with a comprehensive knowledge of the British flora, advised her on any taxonomic problems. Issued in paperback parts, initially 6<i>s</i>. each&#151;which had soared to &pound;2 when the last part, the index, appeared in 1974&#151;it was welcomed by teachers and students, for whom it was largely intended. Sir Edward Salisbury pronounced it to be &#145;a magnificent work of scientific investigation and recording&#146;. It rapidly became a classic in its particular genre of botanical art.<br>
<br>Ross-Craig's line drawings appeared in other publications: 69 in J. Hutchinson and J. M. Dalziel's <span class="italic">Flora of West Tropical Africa</span> (vol. 2, pts 1&#150;2, 1931&#150;6); 16 in F. C. Stern's <span class="italic">Study of the Genus Paeonia</span> (1946); and a few in H. J. Elwes's <span class="italic">Monograph of Genus Lilium</span> (supplement, 1938&#150;40). She contributed three colour plates to G. H. Johnstone's <span class="italic">Asiatic Magnolias in Cultivation</span> (1955), but only the frontispiece to her husband's <span class="italic">Revision of the Genus Camellia</span> (1958). It proved too expensive to include the other Camellia paintings she had executed (seven of them are now in the Kew library) but she compensated for their absence by drawing 102 line figures for the volume. When Sir Jeremiah Colman's fine collection of living orchids was bequeathed to Kew Gardens early in 1942, she painted 49 of them over the next four years and generously presented the paintings to Kew in 1968.<br>
<br>Ross-Craig described her technique of painting and drawing in W. Blunt and W. T. Stearn's <span class="italic">The Art of Botanical Illustration</span> (1994), and in an article in <span class="italic">Medical and Biological Illustration</span> (1953). Before attempting any plant portrait she would absorb what she called its &#145;character or personality&#146;. Only then would she lightly pencil in her composition, adroitly inserting floral dissections in appropriate spaces on the sheet. The smoothness and whiteness of hot-pressed Whatman paper gave her the purity of colour she sought. She objected to being grouped with &#145;flower painters&#146;, seeing herself as a botanical artist subject to the discipline of scientific accuracy. In an undated note, now in the Kew library, she affirmed that, for her, &#145;painting was never routine, always an endeavour to do justice to the plants&#146;  (Ross-Craig to Gren L. Lucas, Ross-Craig papers). As a botanical artist she will be remembered best for her accomplished line drawings, which project three-dimensional images through confident line and stipple shading. She drew in waterproof Indian ink with a flexible lithographic pen on Bristol board. Whenever living plants were not available she would consult Kew herbarium's collections. She had confidently mastered the difficult technique of recreating a plant from a lifeless specimen through a combination of precise draughtsmanship and botanical knowledge.<br>
<br>Volume 182 (1978&#150;80) of <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span> was dedicated to Ross-Craig and her husband, who had been its editor in all but name. Both had &#145;diligently upheld its high standards&#146; for more than half a century. In November 1999 she was presented with the Kew award &#145;in recognition of her outstanding contribution to botanical art&#146;. She received the Royal Horticultural Society's prestigious Veitch memorial medal in 2002. In the same year a selection of her work was exhibited in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and shown again at Kew in 2003.<br>
<br>Ross-Craig was a modest, unassuming person&#151;some called her self-effacing&#151;but this natural reticence concealed firm resolve and stamina, qualities she needed to complete her ambitious <span class="italic">Drawings of British Plants</span>. She cared for her husband during his last years while he suffered from dementia. She spent her declining years at Abbeyfield Nursing Home in Ennerdale Road, Kew, and died in the West Middlesex Hospital in neighbouring Isleworth of bronchopneumonia on 7 February 2006, just six weeks short of her hundredth birthday. The residue of her estate was divided equally between Kew's Bentham-Moxon Trust, which had once employed her, and the Kew Guild, of which her husband had been secretary for many years. She had prepared the preliminary drawings in the application of the guild for a coat of arms and a badge. She expressed a wish that her bequest should be used primarily for travel and plant expeditions and general research. Much of her published art work, miscellaneous watercolours and pencil drawings, a few sketchbooks, and a small archive of correspondence are housed in the Kew library.<br>
