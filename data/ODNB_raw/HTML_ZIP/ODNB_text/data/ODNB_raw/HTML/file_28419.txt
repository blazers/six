<span class="headword">Wakefield,  Peter  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1213), <span class="occ">hermit</span>, was a simple unlettered man, living on a diet of bread and water and with a popular reputation as a prophet. According to Higden:<blockquote>Christ appeared to this Peter twice at York and once at Pontefract, in the likeness of a child between the hands of the priest, inspiring him and saying &#145;Peace, peace, peace&#146; and taught him many things, which afterwards he showed to bishops and people of evil life.</blockquote>In the latter part of 1212&#151;probably on his northern journey of that year&#151;King John heard that the hermit had prophesied that by the following Ascension day, 23 May 1213, the crown would have been transferred from him and his line. Summoned to the king's presence, Peter maintained his conviction of the veracity of his prophecy, adding that were it not true the king could do with him as he pleased.<br>
<br>John committed the prophet to William de Harcourt to be kept in chains at Corfe until the truth of his words should be proved. The prophecy, which is said to have spread even to France, was very generally believed, or at least feared, and the king himself, as the day approached, was evidently nervous. Matthew Paris asserts that this fear hastened John's submission to the papal nuncio, Pandulf, which was completed by the act of homage on the eve of Ascension day 1213. John celebrated the Ascension in state, but some now claimed that the prophecy referred to the calendar anniversary of the king's coronation, Ascension day (27 May) 1199. When this passed, the king ordered Peter, together with his son, to be dragged by horses to Wareham and there hanged.<br>
<br>The story is significant as an illustration of popular opinion in regard to John's act of submission to the pope. The chroniclers are fairly unanimous in declaring that Peter's famous prophecy had indeed been fulfilled, though in a sense other than had been expected.<br>
<br>It is possible that behind Peter's prophecy was a more directly political cause. In 1209 John de Lacy, heir to the honour of Pontefract, was in treasonable correspondence with Philip II of France and was clearly viewed with suspicion by King John when he inherited the honour in 1211; once freed from his heavy relief payments John de Lacy joined the northern rebels in the spring of 1215. Wittingly or not, as the prominent local holy man, Peter may have been a spokesman for rebellion.<br>
