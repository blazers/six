<span class="headword">Shelton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1598&#150;1629), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was probably the third of seven sons of Henry Shelton (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1605), a Dublin merchant imprisoned in 1596 for refusing to take the oath of supremacy when he was elected sheriff, and his wife, Margaret, the sister of Peter Nangle, guardian of the Franciscan convent at Armagh, and thorn in the side of the authorities. Thomas may be the &#145;Thomas Shelton, Dublinensis&#146; in the 1597 student list of the Irish college at Salamanca  (Knowles, 174).<br>
<br>In late 1598 Thomas's elder brother, John, was involved in an abortive plot to seize Dublin Castle for Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, who had mounted a serious rebellion. John was hanged, and Thomas was sought as an accomplice  (Knowles, 164). On 31 March 1600 a spy reported that he was at Tyrone's headquarters with Richard Nugent, a prominent Irish nobleman. A year later he offered his services to Florence MacCarthy, an equally obdurate rebel, in a letter which was intercepted and was added to a growing intelligence file. Nugent and Shelton arrived in Spain in June 1601 and Shelton went on to Flanders. He next turns up (as Thomas Skelton) in February 1604 at a capitular assembly at Douai presided over by Father Christopher Cusack, which suggests he was teaching at one of the English colleges.<br>
<br>Shelton was the first person to translate <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> into English, but his literary career began with an unremarkable piece in <span class="italic">Cynthia</span> (1604), a book of lyric verse published in London by Nugent, and an equally conventional verse, &#145;To his Deare Friend, M. Richard Verstegan&#146;, in Verstegan's <span class="italic">Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities</span> (1605). Shelton's version of the first part of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> was published in London by Edward Blount in 1612. His original was the Velpius edition published in Brussels in 1607  (Knowles, 162). The signs of haste in the translation, which took Shelton only forty days, do not hide his verve, command of Spanish, and knowledge of Spain. Shelton published the second part of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> anonymously with Blount in 1620. James Fitzmaurice-Kelly's introduction to Shelton's translation claims that John Fletcher's <span class="italic">Knight of the Burning Pestle</span> was derived from Shelton, as was <span class="italic">Cardenio</span> (1613), a lost play by Shakespeare and Fletcher. But the book sold slowly, not being reprinted until 1652. It is dedicated to Theophilus Howard, Baron de Walden. Alexander Wright argues that Shelton and Howard were distantly related, which is not impossible despite the lack of evidence. But it is more likely that Howard, who had previously shown interest in contacting English exiles, met Shelton on a visit to the Low Countries in 1610. Shelton's past history would suggest that the &#145;deare friend&#146; of the dedication was Verstegan, given that Verstegan was a Catholic refugee active in religious controversy.<br>
<br>In February 1612 Shelton, together with a Captain Rathfert, contacted William Trumbull, the English agent in Brussels, with authorization to negotiate the reconciliation of Tyrone with the crown. This seems to have prompted accusations that Shelton, Cusack, and John Roche, chaplain to Archbishop Bentivoglio, the nuncio to Brussels, were informers working for the English authorities. After questioning the accused, Bentivoglio wrote to the papal secretary, affirming that Shelton had lived in Flanders for several years and was of honourable reputation. He adds that Shelton's father had died after eight years in prison for his faith, and that his brother had been executed for the attempt on Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1613 Shelton was short of money and ill. When he had recovered, he left for Paris with a letter of introduction from Trumbull to Sir Thomas Edmundes, the English ambassador. Trumbull disapproves of his religion, but attests to Shelton's knowledge of Irish affairs, to his skill in Spanish and French, and to his loyalty to his majesty, for which &#145;he is persecuted by the barbarous Irishe, as a malefactor. He is borne of honest and worthy parents, and allyed to sundry of the best familyes in the English Pale&#146;  (Knowles, 171). Once in Paris Shelton made contact with his cousin, Henry Stanihurst, and M. de Beaulieu, a friend of Trumbull's, and set about looking for work, but without success. His letter of 6 March 1614 to Trumbull, which is extremely abusive about the French, their promises, and their attitude to foreigners, raises the issue of a pardon and return to England: &#145;for I have great hope by my ld. of Walden's means, to get some advancement if I were there&#146;  (George, 157). This must be the dedicatee of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>. Shelton may have given his reasons for seeking a pardon in one of the letters he asked Trumbull to destroy.<br>
<br>Relations with Trumbull now began to cool. In his last letter to Trumbull (28 March 1614) Shelton says he was a messenger for somebody, had been asked to do something underhand, and had refused. Beaulieu reported to Trumbull that Shelton was desperately poor, but that he had acquired either a wife or a mistress. However, a letter written in Spanish (20 November 1629) by Father Thomas Strange, guardian of the Franciscans in Dublin, informs Father Luke Wadding that Strange had received Thomas Shelton of Dublin into the order and asks him to take Shelton into the Franciscan community in Rome  (B. Jennings, <span class="italic">Wadding Papers</span>, 1953, 320). It is not known what happened to the wife or when Shelton died.<br>
