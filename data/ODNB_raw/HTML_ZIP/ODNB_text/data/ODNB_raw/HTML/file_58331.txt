<span class="headword">Archdale <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Russel]</span>,  Helen Alexander</span>  (1876&#150;1949), <span class="occ">feminist and journalist</span>, was born at Nenthorn, Berwickshire, on 25 August 1876, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24292/', "Alexander Russel (1814&#150;1876)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61147/', "Helen Evans, n&#233;e Carter (1834&#150;1903)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61136/', "Edinburgh Seven")</script>]. Her father, who died a month before her birth, was editor of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> and had been an active supporter of Sophia Jex-Blake in her attempts to secure medical education for women in Edinburgh. Her mother was one of the students involved in that campaign.<br>
<br>Helen Russel was educated at St Leonard's School, St Andrews, and subsequently at the University of St Andrews. On 9 October 1901 she married Captain, later Lieutenant-Colonel, Theodore Montgomery Archdale (1875&#150;1918), who at the time was stationed in India. They had two sons and one daughter. She appears to have been estranged from her husband from about 1913.<br>
<br>In September 1908, on her return from India, Helen Archdale joined the militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and soon became a prominent member. She took part in the Scottish suffrage demonstration on 9 October 1909, and a few days later, together with Adela Pankhurst, Maud Joachim, Catherine Corbett, and Laura Evans, disrupted a meeting addressed by Winston Churchill in Dundee, was convicted of breach of the peace, and imprisoned. All four immediately started a hunger strike, and were released after four days. Early in 1910 Helen Archdale became the Sheffield organizer of the WSPU, being briefly relieved by Adela Pankhurst during a spell of ill health. In 1911 she moved to London and became the prisoners' secretary of the union. In December 1911 she herself received a sentence of two months' imprisonment for window-breaking. From October 1912 onwards she worked in various capacities on the union's new organ <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span> and from 1915 on its successor <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. In addition, during the First World War she started a training farm for women agricultural workers, served as a clerical worker with Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps from 1917, and in 1918 worked in the women's department of the Ministry of National Service.<br>
<br>In addition to her friendship with Adela Pankhurst, whom she helped by employing her as a governess for her children while on holiday in Switzerland in 1913, Helen Archdale had an intense relationship with Lady Rhondda, which seems to have begun in committee work during the First World War, though they also shared a background in suffrage militancy. By the early 1920s, she was sharing an apartment, and, together with her family, a country house (Stonepits, Kent) with Lady Rhondda. In 1920 Lady Rhondda founded the political and cultural weekly <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> (its feminist orientation was implied by the understood complement: &#145;wait for no man&#146;); Helen Archdale was the editor. Soon after, the feminist Six Point Group was formed along lines enunciated in <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, with Helen Archdale as a founder member (she was the group's international secretary until 1933). However, philosophical disagreements, as well as Lady Rhondda's increasing editorial interventions, resulted in her being effectively forced out of the editorship of <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> in 1926. Although she remained a director of Time and Tide Publishing Company, after her resignation specifically feminist concerns were gradually marginalized in <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>.<br>
<br>However, Helen Archdale's feminist involvement continued unabated. From 1927 she was a co-opted member of the Liaison Committee of Women's International Organizations in Geneva, and was increasingly drawn into the mainstream of internationalist and pacifist feminism. From 1926 to 1934 she chaired Equal Rights International, an organization dedicated to promoting campaigning for equality of women with men in law and in the workplace. This organization was relatively short-lived, mainly because of tensions within the membership, particularly the increasingly fraught relations between Alice Paul of the Women's Party of the USA and the other members. However, the Open Door Council and Open Door International, of which she was also a founder member, lasted much longer. These organizations were more specifically devoted to women's equality within the workplace, especially by opposing &#145;protective&#146; legislation which they claimed was used to restrict women's access to higher paid employment.<br>
<br>Helen Archdale was also prominent in a number of other feminist organizations in the inter-war period. She was at various times secretary of the Women's Political and Industrial League, and a member of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women, the Electrical Association of Women, and the Institute of Journalists. She also contributed articles to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, <span class="italic">Christian Science Monitor</span>, and <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>.<br>
<br>Helen Archdale seems not to have been politically active during the Second World War. Her daughter Helen Elizabeth (Betty) Archdale served in the Women's Royal Naval Service, and later became principal of the women's college in the University of Sydney, Australia. Helen Archdale died at 17 Grove Court, St John's Wood, London, on 8 December 1949, her husband having predeceased her.<br>
