<span class="headword">Farindon,  Anthony</span>  (1598&#150;1658), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Sonning, Berkshire, and baptized there on 24 December 1598, the son of Thomas Farndon or Faringdon. Admitted as a scholar to Trinity College, Oxford, on 9 June 1612, he graduated BA on 26 June 1616, and became a fellow in 1617. He proceeded MA on 28 March 1620 and, at about the same time, was ordained in the Church of England. According to Anthony Wood he was &#145;a noted Preacher in these parts, an eminent Tutor in the College, and a worthy example to be imitated by all&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.144). Henry Ireton, who was admitted to Trinity as a gentleman commoner in 1626, &#145;had the character in that house of a stubborn and sawcy fellow towards the Seniors&#146; in the college  (ibid., 2.81) and Farindon is reported to have said that Ireton &#145;would prove either the best or worst instrument that ever this kingdom bred&#146;  (Lloyd, 543). Farindon proceeded BD on 17 December 1629.<br>
<br>In 1634 Farindon became the vicar of Bray in Berkshire, a living valued at &pound;120 a year. Around the time of his move to Bray he married his wife, Elizabeth. In 1639 Farindon was appointed by his diocesan, John Bancroft, bishop of Oxford, reader or lecturer in divinity at St George's Chapel, Windsor. The appointment had the support of Archbishop William Laud. At Windsor, Farindon became a friend of John Hales, who was a canon of Windsor Chapel and a fellow of Eton College.<br>
<br>After the parliamentarian victory at the second battle of Newbury in late October 1644 Farindon's vicarage was taken over by now quartermaster-general Ireton, and soldiers were housed there. Farindon was ejected as vicar and replaced by William Brice, who was afterwards replaced by Hezekiah Woodward in 1649. According to Wood, Woodward refused to pay the required fifths of the revenues of the benefice to Farindon's wife for the family's needs  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.394&#150;5). As a result, although Gilbert Sheldon, the future archbishop, gave financial assistance in 1650, David Lloyd states that Farindon, his wife, and their half dozen children were &#145;likely to have starved&#146; had it not been for John Robinson, a London merchant, and the parishioners of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, London  (Lloyd, 543). The rector of St Mary Magdalen, Thomas Case, a presbyterian, had left his position rather than subscribe to the engagement (which would have committed him to the present government), and the congregation was divided over whether to replace him with a presbyterian or an Independent. When Farindon preached on Robinson's invitation he made such a favourable impression that he was subsequently asked to be rector.<br>
<br>Farindon was one of a remarkable number of royalist and episcopalian clergymen who moved into London in the early 1650s and ministered in public capacities. Farindon's congregation included so many scholars dislocated by religious and political changes that it was known as the &#145;scholars church&#146;. However, as a result of the government proclamation of late 1655 that no sequestered minister could preach in London, Farindon was silenced in 1656. He preached a farewell sermon, and in following weeks a friend preached two sermons to mark his departure, eventually published in 1674 with <span class="italic">Fifty Sermons</span> of Farindon's own. As a result of these occasions some &pound;400 was contributed for his and his family's support, and in 1657 he was assisted by Brian Duppa, the future bishop of Winchester.<br>
<br>One of the clergymen who assisted Farindon in the late 1640s and whom Farindon in turn assisted in the 1650s was John Hales. According to Walker, Hales had been &#145;the chief support&#146; of Farindon and his family when their needs had been greatest  (Walker, 94). Farindon then visited Hales in Windsor when the latter had lost his canonry and his fellowship. Near the end of Hales's life, Farindon, on discovering that his friend was nearly destitute, offered him &pound;50 at once and more when needed. When Hales died in 1656 Farindon undertook to write his life, but had not completed it before his own death two years later. However, Anthony Wood suggested that his notes might have reached the hands of William Fulman of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, whose collection of materials on Hales was used by later writers. In a letter to Timothy Garthwait, subsequently the publisher of the <span class="italic">Golden Remains of the Ever Memorable Mr John Hales of Eton College</span> (1659), Farindon gives an insight into Hales's experience as an observer at the Synod of Dort in 1618&#150;19 not found in Hales's own correspondence. Having observed that &#145;in his younger days [Hales] was a Calvinist&#146;, Farindon wrote that it was &#145;at that Synod, and at the well pressing 3. S. John 16. by Episcopius [the Arminian Simon Episcopius]&#146; that Hales &#145;bid John Calvin good night, as he has often told me&#146;  (Hales, sig. A4).<br>
<br>Farindon's <span class="italic">XXX. Sermons Lately Preached at the Parish Church of Saint Mary Magdalen Milkstreet, London</span>, with an additional sermon preached at the funeral of Sir George Whitmore, lord mayor of London, appeared in 1657 (misdated as 1647 in some copies), with a preface by Farindon suggesting that he was still barred from the pulpit. It was dedicated to John Robinson. The basis of Farindon's appeal as a preacher is partly suggested by his statement in the preface that he had tried to present &#145;those more necessary and essential truths, by the embracing of which we lay hold on happiness, and come nearest to it&#146;, rather than engaging in theological speculation. The sermons are vigorous, pastoral, and learned in an unintimidating way, and are well supported by passages of scripture. One reason for Farindon's appeal to royalists and episcopalians is suggested by his statement that the form of ecclesiastical polity that the present age had swept away&#151;namely, episcopacy&#151;was &#145;the fairest bulwark the Church had to secure her from the Incursions of Schisme, Heresy, and Prophanenesse&#146;  (sig. **4). A second volume, <span class="italic">Forty Sermons</span>, appeared in 1663, dedicated to the lawyer and judge Sir Orlando Bridgeman, who is said to have assisted Farindon and other &#145;distressed clergymen&#146;  (sig. A3).<br>
<br>Farindon's wife, Elizabeth, had died before her husband's departure from the Milk Street pulpit, and was buried at St Mary Magdalen on 31 July 1655. Following his death, on 9 October 1658, he too was buried there, suggesting that he had continued to live nearby. His will, dated 6 October 1656, left bequests of &pound;700 and mentioned six children&#151;Anne, Anthony, Charles, Margaret, Merioll, and Elizabeth.<br>
