<span class="headword">Shadwell, Sir  Charles Frederick Alexander</span>  (1814&#150;1886), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 31 January 1814, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25193/', "Sir Lancelot Shadwell (1779&#150;1850)")</script> and his wife, Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1814), the sister of Sir John Richardson, judge of the court of common pleas. In 1827 he was entered as a scholar at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, whence he passed into the navy in 1829. In 1833 he passed his examination, and on 28 June 1838 was made lieutenant. He was then appointed to the frigate <i>Castor</i> (36 guns), going out to the Mediterranean, where in 1840 he was present at the operations on the coast of Syria, including the capture of Acre. In December 1841 he was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Fly</i>, and for more than four years was employed in surveying in Torres Strait and on the northern coast of Australia. On the <i>Fly</i> being paid out of commission, Shadwell was promoted commander (27 June 1846). He then studied for some time at the Royal Naval College, taking a certificate in &#145;steam&#146;, and devoting himself more especially to nautical astronomy. In February 1850 he was appointed to command the <i>Sphinx</i>, which he took out to the East Indies, and in her had an active share in the Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852), for which he twice received the thanks of the governor-general in council; on 7 February 1853 he was advanced to the rank of captain, and on 5 December he was nominated a CB.<br>
<br>In August 1856 Shadwell commissioned the <i>Highflyer</i> for the China station, where in 1857 he took part in the operations in the Canton River leading up to the capture of Canton in December, and in the disastrous attack on the Taku (Dagu) forts on 25 June 1859, when, in leading the landing party across the mud flat, he received a severe wound in the ankle, which rendered him permanently lame. In January 1860 he was relieved from the command of the <i>Highflyer</i> and returned to England.<br>
<br>From February 1861 to August 1862 Shadwell commanded the <i>Aboukir</i> (90 guns) in the Mediterranean and West Indies, and from October 1862 to June 1864 the <i>Hastings</i>, the flagship of Sir Lewis Jones at Queenstown. He was captain-superintendent of the Gosport victualling yard and of Haslar Hospital from June 1864 until his promotion to the rank of rear-admiral on 15 January 1869. From August 1871 to May 1875 he was commander-in-chief in China, and was made KCB on 24 May 1873. He was promoted vice-admiral in 1875 and became an admiral on the retired list in 1879. From 1878 to 1881 he was president of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, after which he lived in retirement at Meadow Bank, Melksham, in Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Despite his long, and in some instances brilliant, service, Shadwell had rather the temperament of a scholar than of a warrior. He was deeply attached to the study of nautical astronomy, on which he published a number of pamphlets. For many years he was engaged on a work on the subject, which gradually assumed almost encyclopaedic proportions without ever reaching his ideal of completeness, and which remained unfinished at his death. He was elected FRS on 6 June 1861, and was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical and Royal Geographical societies. He died, unmarried, at Meadow Bank, on 1 March 1886.<br>
