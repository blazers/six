<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newall,  Cyril Louis Norton</span>, first Baron Newall  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 15 February 1886 at Mussooree in north-west India, the only son and the second child of Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) William Potter Newall, of the Indian army, and his wife, Edith Gwendoline Caroline Norton. He was educated at Bedford School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned in the Royal Warwickshire regiment on 16 August 1905. He went with his regiment to India, transferred to the Indian army, and served from September 1909 on the north-west frontier with King Edward's Own Gurkha rifles. During an exercise, he and his Gurkhas were &#145;annihilated&#146; while still at breakfast by a force led by Hugh Dowding, who later achieved greater fame as head of Fighter Command (1936&#150;40).<br>
<br>While on leave in England in 1911 Newall learned to fly at Larkhill, Salisbury Plain, and instructed in India before returning permanently to England in 1914. He joined the Royal Flying Corps as a captain and instructed at the Central Flying School, Upavon, Wiltshire. In March 1915 he was promoted major and from September prepared 12 squadron for service in France, under his command. Although he was not yet thirty, he gave up flying and concentrated on efficient management&#151;a skill much needed by so new a service. His pilots and observers regarded him with limited respect until 3 January 1916, when he faced up to a challenge on the ground with as much courage as any man could show in the air. Noticing smoke emerging from a wooden shed where some 2000 bombs were stored on his airfield at St Omer, Newall ordered hoses to be brought up, walked calmly into the shed (followed by three corporals), dragged several bombs to safe places, and helped put out the fire. An eyewitness recalled &#145;a dirty and blackened figure, very unlike his usual immaculately turned-out self&#146;, busily rolling &#145;red-hot bombs out of harm's way&#146;  (Pollard, 25). He was awarded the Albert medal (first class, gold) on the personal recommendation of General Trenchard, head of the Royal Flying Corps in France; those who helped him received the second-class (bronze) version of that medal.<br>
<br>Newall returned to England in February 1916 on promotion to lieutenant-colonel to command a training wing. In December he went back to France as head of 9 wing (seven squadrons), and during 1917 he organized numerous long-distance reconnaissances and raids. 41 wing (later renamed 8 brigade, with five squadrons) was formed under his command at Ochey, near Nancy, in October 1917 to specialize in raids on Germany. That brigade, led by Newall as a brigadier-general from December, joined Trenchard's independent bombing force after May 1918. Its actual achievements were small, but both Trenchard and Newall became convinced that the morale impact of bombing on Germans had been devastating.<br>
<br>Granted a permanent commission as a group captain in August 1919, Newall served as deputy director of personnel (1919&#150;22), commander of the school of technical training (for apprentices) at Halton, Buckinghamshire (1923&#150;5), and head of operations and intelligence in the Air Ministry (1926&#150;31). He was promoted air commodore in January 1925 and air vice-marshal in January 1930. From 1931 to 1934 he fulfilled his one and only overseas posting&#151;to Cairo, as head of RAF Middle East. In January 1935 he became air member for supply and organization, a newly created position in which he was responsible for aircraft supply, bases, and stores at a time of rapid expansion. It has often been alleged that he had reached the limit of his capabilities when he was promoted air marshal in June 1935 and knighted (KCB) in July.<br>
<br>In September 1937, however, and much to the surprise and disappointment of Dowding, Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, and Sir Wilfrid Freeman&#151;all of whom have been supposed to be his superiors in every respect&#151;Newall was appointed chief of the air staff on the recommendation of Lord Swinton, secretary of state for air, as successor to Sir Edward Ellington. Dowding and Freeman were probably too abrasive and too severe on senior colleagues of ordinary ability to thrive in that appointment, but it may be that Ludlow-Hewitt possessed all Newall's qualities, in addition to a stronger grasp of bombing capabilities in particular and air force organization in general. Trenchard and Salmond, though retired, remained influential and soon regretted their failure to oppose Newall's elevation&#151;which brought with it promotion to air chief marshal and a GCB in 1938.<br>
<br>Sir John Slessor, who worked closely with Newall in the late 1930s, described him as &#145;the prime architect of the wartime air force&#146;  (Slessor, 241); this high praise is not echoed by other contemporaries or subsequent historians, but Slessor was certainly one of the RAF's shrewdest high commanders. Newall was an orthodox disciple of Trenchard, who believed that a powerful bomber force would probably deter an aggressor; if not, it would certainly wreck his economy very quickly; and no effective fighter defence was possible. In fact, just such a defence&#151;based on radar and heavily armed monoplane fighters&#151;was then being developed in Fighter Command (under Dowding), while in Bomber Command Ludlow-Hewitt was bluntly informing the Air Ministry that a Trenchardist &#145;knock-out blow&#146; lay far in the future.<br>
<br>Newall, though ignorant of modern bomber or fighter issues, and lacking the staff college experience&#151;as pupil or teacher&#151;that might have broadened his mind, failed to remedy his ignorance. On the other hand, he played a key part in the decisions to order Hurricane and Spitfire fighters and to construct &#145;shadow&#146; factories, where aircraft were produced in quantity at a time of urgent need, and when the administrative machinery for aircraft development and production was reorganized in 1938. He rejected accepted wisdom that there would be no special demand for an aircraft repair organization if war came, and just such an organization did in fact play a vital part in boosting aircraft supply to the RAF, not only during the battle of Britain but throughout the war.<br>
<br>Instead of spending time with Dowding and Ludlow-Hewitt, his principal commanders, Newall remained in his office, vainly resisting the government's growing emphasis on fighters rather than bombers. He learned nothing from the Luftwaffe's conduct of operations during the Spanish Civil War and even asserted that its adroit support of ground forces was a gross misuse of air power. He therefore resisted demands for similar support of British and French soldiers in the event of (and then in the face of) a German invasion of France. He failed to realize that his bombers could cause significant damage to German targets only if they operated from French bases. When German forces occupied the channel coast, and the Luftwaffe prepared to attack targets in south-east England, he still thought it best to employ bombers against &#145;strategic&#146; targets far behind the front line. As Sholto Douglas (a senior assistant) observed, Newall was &#145;an absolute bag of nerves&#146; by 1940. &#145;He worked at his desk in the Air Ministry during the day, and he had a cell underground where he used to work and sleep at nights. He never left the place&#146;  (Douglas to Wright, 2 July 1963).<br>
<br>Newall certainly did more in May and June 1940 than some admirers of Dowding have admitted to resist Churchill's readiness to send British fighters to assist the French in an obviously lost cause. Newall had sacked Ludlow-Hewitt in April and wished to get rid of Dowding also, but Churchill's objection&#151;and a succession of desperate crises&#151;thwarted him. From May onwards he was himself under growing pressure. A memorandum composed by Wing Commander Edgar Kingston-McCloughry (a member of the Air Ministry's directorate of war organization), and circulated anonymously, castigated Newall as &#145;A Weak Link in the Nation's Defences&#146;: his mental capacity was inadequate, his practical experience was limited, his character and personality were weak, and he lacked judgement and foresight  (Ritchie). Whatever his merits as a diligent manager, it was clear by mid-1940 that Newall was unable to galvanize the Air Ministry, regarded by Churchill as &#145;a most cumbersome and ill-working administrative machine&#146;, into the alertness required in wartime.<br>
<br>Lord Beaverbrook (appointed minister of aircraft production by Churchill in May) eagerly backed the campaign against Newall, partly because he agreed with Kingston-McCloughry and partly because Newall opposed many of the actions of the new ministry. By September Beaverbrook was receiving powerful support from Trenchard and Salmond, director of armament production in that ministry. They recognized Newall's general weakness, but they also had two particular fears: that he would prove unable to resist growing pressure for the creation of an Army Air Corps to give direct support to ground forces, and that he no longer believed absolutely in the bomber doctrine. Unlike Trenchard and Salmond, Newall had come to recognize that his bomber force was quite incapable, at least in the near future, of causing serious injury to Germany and was more usefully employed helping Fighter Command to prevent an invasion of Britain. Trenchard went over Newall's head on 25 September, writing directly to Churchill to urge that Bomber Command be used solely against &#145;strategic&#146; targets in Germany. Churchill agreed on 2 October that Newall should go, and Portal replaced him on 25 October 1940.<br>
<br>After three hard years, made harder by Britain's unreadiness for war, by France's shockingly sudden collapse, and by increasingly bitter criticism from powerful, unscrupulous men, Newall was more than ready to go. Promotion to marshal of the RAF and appointment to the Order of Merit at the end of 1940, plus a nice long rest as governor-general of New Zealand from February 1941 to April 1946 (rewarded by a barony in June 1946), consoled him. He took no further part in public affairs, wrote no memoirs, and made no speeches. At the close of the twentieth century no historian had yet closely examined his work in the critical years 1935&#150;40.<br>
<br>In 1922 Newall married May Dulcie Weddell, who died on 29 September 1924. He then married, on 16 April 1925 in Cannes, Olive Tennyson Foster, the only daughter of Mrs Francis Storer Eaton of Boston, Massachusetts. They had a son and two daughters. A slim man, always neatly dressed, Newall was even-tempered and had a ready smile and a pleasant voice: he was at his best in small gatherings, where he listened more than he spoke. He died at his London home, 37 Welbeck Street, on 30 November 1963, and was survived by his wife; his son, Francis (<i>b</i>. 1930), succeeded to the title.<br>
