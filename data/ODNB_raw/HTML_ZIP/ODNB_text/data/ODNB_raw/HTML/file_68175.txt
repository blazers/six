<span class="headword">Kinsey,  John</span>  (1693&#150;1750), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer</span>, was born in Philadelphia, the son of John Kinsey, politician and Quaker minister, and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevens. Kinsey probably attended Philadelphia's Friends' public school until the family moved to Woodbridge, New Jersey, about 1703. Kinsey then began an apprenticeship with a joiner in New York. However, his &#145;Inquisitive disposition, and a Genius for something above his then employ&#146; prompted him to study law, probably in Philadelphia with David Lloyd. He was admitted to the bar there in 1724 and to that at New Jersey in 1725, before settling in Woodbridge to practise law. On 9 September 1725 he married Mary Kearney, daughter of Philp Kearney of Philadelphia. During the 1720s and early 1730s he served as a legislator in the New Jersey assembly. He was named speaker of the house in 1730, a position formerly held by his father. In addition, he is often credited with preparing the first compilation of New Jersey laws in the year 1732.<br>
<br>Kinsey moved to Philadelphia in 1730 and was immediately elected to the Pennsylvania legislature. He held seats concurrently in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey assemblies during the 1730s. In 1739 he obtained the position of speaker in the Pennsylvania house, which he retained, bar a short interlude, for the remainder of his life. Between 1738 and 1741 Kinsey also served as attorney-general and as chief justice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania (1743&#150;50). In addition, he was named acting trustee of the Pennsylvania general loan office in 1739, another position which he held until his death. Named in 1737 as a commissioner to settle the boundary dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania, he also served as a representative to the Albany Convention with the Six Nations in 1745.<br>
<br>Alongside these offices, Kinsey was also a prominent member of the Philadelphia Quaker community. Between 1730 and 1750 he was the presiding clerk of the Philadelphia yearly meeting, the most important position within the Quaker denomination. As both chief clerk of the Friends' meeting and speaker of the Pennsylvania house, Kinsey had attained the highest leadership role in both of these institutions. He further served the Quakers as correspondent to the London meeting and overseer of the press.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1750, while trying a case in Burlington before the New Jersey supreme court, Kinsey suffered what may have been a stroke. He died that evening and was buried two days later. It was later discovered that his estate owed &pound;3000 to the general loan office, a sum&#151;fifteen times his salary as chief justice&#151;that he had taken for his own use. Disclosure of Kinsey's misappropriation of government finances came as a severe blow to the Quaker denomination, coming as it did after Friends had been warned in 1746 not to dishonour the community through corrupt business practices. Kinsey's posthumous reputation means that he has been invariably overlooked in histories of Quakerism in Philadelphia. More recently the work of Edwin B. Bronner and others has focused attention on Kinsey's contribution as one of the most significant Quaker political and religious leaders in colonial America.<br>
