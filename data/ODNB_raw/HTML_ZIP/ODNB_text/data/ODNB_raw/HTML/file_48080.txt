<span class="headword">Murrant, Sir  Ernest Henry</span>  (1889&#150;1974), <span class="occ">shipping company executive</span>, was born on 15 July 1889 at Brixton, London, the only son of Henry John Murrant (1857&#150;1943), in his later life a self-employed builder, and Minna Augusta Schultz (1852/3&#150;1931). He experienced only a rudimentary education in south London before leaving school at the age of thirteen. On 1 August 1914 he married May (1884&#150;1973), the youngest daughter of John Archer, a tailor, of Belfast. The couple had two children, one of whom, a daughter, died in infancy.<br>
<br>Apart from spells during the two world wars when Ernest Murrant was seconded to government service, he spent his whole working life with the shipping company Furness Withy. He joined the firm in 1902 as an office boy following an introduction secured by his father. His outstanding shorthand skills brought him to the notice of his superiors, and Murrant was soon appointed secretary to Sir Frederick Lewis, who became chairman of Furness Withy in 1919, when the company was reorganized to buy out the Furness family interest. Murrant worked closely with Lewis, not just as his personal secretary, but with executive responsibility for seeing through the chairman's ideas. Murrant was elected a director of Furness Withy in 1924, and deputy chairman in 1935, by which time the firm was an integrated, multinational company, which operated on its own account and controlled a diversified portfolio of assets. Upon the death of Lewis (then Lord Essendon) in 1945, Murrant was appointed chairman.<br>
<br>Murrant's chairmanship was conservative and uncontroversial, as he grappled with the problems facing British shipowners after the Second World War. Furness Withy accumulated substantial reserves, but under Murrant's guiding hand the firm doubled its fleet tonnage by 1959, and opened new routes to replace those lost to foreign competition. His style of leadership was probably that of strong central control, epitomized by Lord Essendon, rather than the decentralized managerial system that became more common in the 1960s. With hindsight it is clear that Murrant may have overlooked crucial business opportunities, though many of the lost chances of British shipping occurred after his retirement, from ill health, in 1959.<br>
<br>Murrant's public career started at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, when he joined the Board of Trade as a member of the shipping control committee, advising upon the collection and distribution of neutral and captured enemy tonnage to allied owners, for which work he was appointed MBE in 1918. During the Second World War Murrant was appointed by the minister of war transport as special representative in the Near East, responsible for co-ordinating allied tonnage, liaising with friendly governments, and advising the Middle East Supply Centre, services recognized by his appointment as KCMG in 1944. The remainder of Sir Ernest's public career was entirely conventional. He enjoyed many directorships in shipping and the financial services sectors, and was a member of a number of City livery companies. He retained a keen interest in the training and welfare of seamen throughout his life, assuming a number of important voluntary responsibilities for these areas. He was also president of the chamber of shipping (1947&#150;8), and he served on official inquiries into Britain's shipping industry.<br>
<br>To business colleagues Murrant may have appeared somewhat cold, with a ferocious capacity for hard work. To his family he was a devoted husband and kindly father, who in his last years preferred the quiet of home to the bustle of society. His wife's death in 1973 seemed to sap his own will to live, and, after increasing ill health, he died on 29 March 1974, at his home, Browning's Manor, Blackboys, near Uckfield, Sussex. He was cremated at Framfield, near Uckfield. His son, Geoffrey, subsequently became deputy chairman of Furness Withy.<br>
