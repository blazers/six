<span class="headword">Wesenham,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1333&#150;1382), <span class="occ">merchant, shipowner, and financier</span>, was named after the Norfolk village of Weasenham, 6 miles east of Bishop's Lynn. In the early stages of his career his economic interest clearly centred on shipping and the grain trade, which in East Anglia went hand in hand; hence his earliest recorded venture, in the form of a licence of 20 March 1333 to export corn to Norway in his own ships and return with fish. Intermittently customs collector at Boston between 1335 and 1337, on 3 June 1335 he obtained a lifetime grant of wool tronnage duty in that port, but this was later revoked, since it already belonged to someone else. On 18 April 1337 he was released from the Tower of London pending inquiries into suspected breaches of shipping regulations; he was later cleared of the charges. From 8 June 1337 to 25 March 1338 Wesenham was in personal command of a heavily armed ship from Bishop's Lynn, which served in Gascony, and he continued to be active in naval affairs; on 20 July 1342 he and other men of Bishop's Lynn, then engaged in arraying ships for the king's northern fleet, were respited from an indictment alleging the plunder of a ship called the <i>Taryte</i>. There is no evidence that he exported wool before the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, and he played no part in Edward III's attempt to monopolize the nation's wool trade in 1337 by using the prerogative right of purveyance. Not until 1340 did Wesenham, in partnership with Walter Chiriton, contract to buy 600 sacks of Warwickshire wool, part of the tax in kind granted to the king that year; in 1341 he bought 600 sacks in Norfolk. Wool was probably still peripheral to his interests, but the business led to his receiving a personal summons to an assembly of merchants in July 1340. Thereafter he was regularly summoned to other such meetings which distinguish the middle years of Edward III's reign.<br>
<br>In August 1345 Wesenham seized the opportunity to move into the inner circle of royal financiers, when a syndicate of English merchants currently farming the customs duties was unable to meet the king's request for a loan. In partnership with his brother Simon and others Wesenham raised 20,000 florins in Bruges and was awarded the customs farm at the existing rent of &pound;50,000 a year. At Michaelmas 1346 they were outbid by a syndicate led by Walter Chiriton, Wesenham's partner in 1340, but in April 1347 the rivals agreed to co-operate to dispose of a tax of 20,000 sacks of wool. In July 1348 Wesenham paid Chiriton &pound;4000 and in return received a pledge on the king's great crown, then held by the latter. After the collapse of Chiriton's company in April 1349 Wesenham restored the crown to the king without immediate payment, but in June 1350 he was awarded rents in London belonging to members of the company, to be held until the debt was liquidated. Only part of Wesenham's advances to the king in this period came from his personal fortune; the rest was borrowed on Wesenham's own credit from other Englishmen and Hanseatic merchants; reimbursements came from remissions of export duties, assignments of lay subsidies, and the issues of alien benefices in the king's hands. It was a risky business, but it paid off and was the key to further royal favour. From 11 January 1347 to Michaelmas 1350 Wesenham held the office of royal butler and during the general recoinage, beginning at Michaelmas 1350, he served as exchanger of coins.<br>
<br>Wesenham retired from the centre of royal finances after receiving, on 23 April 1352, a generous pardon for any and all offences he may have committed. He remained active in trade; on 28 July 1353 he was licensed to export wool without payment of the alien duty, then also paid by denizens; throughout the decade he received licences to export corn. At this period, like many other successful merchants, he was probably investing in land to create an inheritance for his posterity. The full extent of his estates is not known, but on 14 March 1350 he and his heirs were granted free warren in their demesne lands in Weasenham and eleven other places in Norfolk. He also farmed a number of lands from the crown, including the temporalities of the bishopric of Lincoln, held for 3740 marks a year from 1 February 1357 to 6 October 1360. He married his son, Hugh, to Agnes, daughter of John Bruis, whose wardship he bought from Simon Islip, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1366), for 500 marks. Hugh and Agnes received her lands in April 1353, but in 1358 had to surrender half to a sister, who earlier had been wrongly described as a nun.<br>
<br>On 30 January 1360 Wesenham again became active in the king's service, undertaking to provide, equip, and man ships in the North Sea, for a lump payment of &pound;4500. He commanded this fleet in person, and on 10 July payment was authorized from the proceeds of a lay subsidy. His last major service was as one of two mayors, heading a company of merchants formed to govern Calais from 1 March 1363. The intention was to stop a drain on the exchequer and make the town and garrison financially self-supporting, largely through duties imposed on wool passing through the staple which was established there. The experiment ended in failure after less than a year. For Wesenham one of the consequences was a spell of imprisonment in the Tower, together with Henry Brisele, master of the Calais mint, presumably for suspected coinage offences. They were released on 22 June 1365. Towards the end of his life Wesenham may have fallen on hard times. On 20 June 1380 he was granted a life annuity of &pound;46 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. and 2 tuns of wine, &#145;in aid of his estate&#146;, for good services to Edward III. This was charged against the customs collectors of Bishop's Lynn and Boston. An order to pay arrears, dated 18 November 1382, is the last known reference to Wesenham.<br>
