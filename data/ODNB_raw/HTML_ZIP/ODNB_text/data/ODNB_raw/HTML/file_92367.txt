<span class="headword">Graham,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1821), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Dundee on 24 April 1778, the second of three sons and nine daughters of Robert Graham (1749&#150;1815), twelfth laird of Fintry, and his wife, Margaret Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mylne, of Mylnefield in Perthshire. The eldest son, Robert, entered the service of the East India Company and was murdered with others at Benares in 1799; thus John became thirteenth laird of Fintry in succession to his father in 1815. The title was one in name only because, due to his financial embarrassment, the twelfth laird had disposed of the estate. The driving ambition of John's career was &#145;to merit and obtain as much money as would enable us to buy a bit of land in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Graham MSS</span>, 126).<br>
<br>John Graham had no professional military training but the wars with France (1783&#150;1815) gave young men the opportunity of a military career. He was commissioned an ensign in the 85th regiment in 1794 but he transferred almost immediately (with the rank of lieutenant) to the 90th regiment then being raised by his kinsman Thomas Graham. With this regiment John saw active service in an expedition to the Bay of Biscay (which arrived too late to help the French royalists) and spent some months in the futile occupation of the &Icirc;le d'Yeu. Subsequently he was attached to the Austrian army in Italy, with which he served in the campaign of 1797. Two years later, raised to the rank of captain, he served as aide-de-camp to Lord Chatham in the duke of York's expedition to North Holland, but, disabled by an accident, he was not present at any of the action.<br>
<br>In February 1800 Graham undertook to raise 100 men in the 93rd highlanders&#151;a regiment then being raised by Colonel Wemyss of Wemyss&#151;which, if successful, would entitle him to receive his majority. This he did, and he joined the regiment in the autumn of 1800 in Guernsey where it remained until ordered home in 1802. Graham had hoped to be promoted lieutenant-colonel by raising 400 additional men for the regiment, but this intention was frustrated by the peace of Amiens in 1803. The regiment was ordered to Ireland and Graham was appointed first to receive the reserve, then to command a battalion of light infantry militia, and finally to be assistant quartermaster-general until 1805 when the regiment was ordered on secret foreign service.<br>
<br>On the resumption of war with France in 1805 the regiment sailed into the Atlantic on an expedition under Sir David Baird. Only when the ships left San Salvador were the sealed instructions opened and the soldiers discovered they were on their way to the Cape of Good Hope to recover that colony from the Dutch allies of Napoleon. The Dutch militia was overwhelmed by the British forces in the battle of Blaauberg on 8 January 1806 and the Dutch commander-in-chief and governor Jan Willem Janssens signed the articles of capitulation on 18 January 1806. Among the Dutch soldiers who surrendered was a corps of Khoi (then known as Hottentot) soldiers. These soldiers were induced (though not against their inclination) to transfer to British authority. Graham was given command of the regiment and promoted lieutenant-colonel. His task was to make this Cape regiment an effective, disciplined force for the defence of the colony.<br>
<br>The eastern migration of the Dutch colonists at the Cape and the westward migration of the Xhosa was the cause of friction on the eastern frontier of the colony. The British authorities decided that the boundary line of the Great Fish River agreed upon by the Dutch and minor Xhosa chiefdoms in 1779 and confirmed by the council of policy in 1780 should be made effective, hence Xhosa who had settled on colonial territory were to be asked to return to lands beyond the Fish River. Only if diplomacy failed was force to be used. Efforts to persuade the Xhosa to withdraw were unsuccessful, and in December 1811 the British offensive began.<br>
<br>Graham was the overall commander in the Cape Frontier War of 1811&#150;12. He was appointed special commissioner for military and civil affairs over the eastern districts and, besides his own Cape regiment, had command of a force of burghers and such soldiers as could be spared from other duties. This war was the first in which the Xhosa encountered a military force supported by a civil authority determined to achieve its objectives. It has been argued that total war was a new and shattering experience for the Xhosa  (Peires, 66). The techniques used were brutal and included the burning of kraals and crops. The war was over by early March 1812 and the Xhosa driven from the colony. The Xhosa, however, never accepted that the coastal lands between the Fish and Sundays rivers known as the Zuurveld were not theirs by right of first occupation, and they continued to challenge British occupation of the territory for another half a century.<br>
<br>Graham was charged with the post-war settlement. He recognized that the peace would be an uneasy one. He recommended, and the governor, Sir John Cradock, concurred, that the Fish River boundary should be supported by a line of military posts. Cradock instructed Graham to select for the military headquarters some suitable spot which would also support a civilian population. The spot chosen was an abandoned loan-place farm, well watered and within easy proximity to the boundary. A government notice dated 14 August 1812 named it Graham's Town in honour of Graham, and the town was designated the seat of the deputy landdrost of the district of Uitenhage.<br>
<br>Graham was offered the post of civil and military commissioner on the eastern frontier at the then magnificent salary of &pound;1000 per annum. Thinking this appointment to be secure he asked, for personal reasons, that it be temporarily suspended. On 24 July 1812 he married Johanna Catharina Cloete (1790&#150;1843), third daughter of Roedolph Cloete (1762&#150;1816) of Westervoort (Great Westerford), Rondebosch, near Cape Town. A son and three daughters were born of the marriage.<br>
<br>In September 1812 Graham and his wife sailed for Britain. While there, he proposed to the government that 500 highland crofters should be settled on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony. Nothing came of the suggestion, which anticipated subsequent schemes for emigration to the colony. He was again offered the opportunity to serve with the British forces in the Netherlands. Having obtained the government's permission, and its promise that his going to Europe would not affect his interests at the Cape, he was appointed military secretary and first aide-de-camp to Sir Thomas Graham. He took part at the battle of Mersem, the attack on Bergen-op-Zoom, and other minor skirmishes. In June 1814 he was gazetted full colonel.<br>
<br>On his return to the Cape in 1815 Graham was disappointed to find that the post he had been promised on the eastern frontier had been abolished and that plans were well advanced for the reorganization of the Cape regiment. He accepted the post of commandant of Simonstown which he held until his death. In 1820 the acting governor of Cape Colony (Sir Rufane Donkin) asked him to go to the frontier to supervise Lord Charles Somerset's ambitious project for the immigration of British settlers, but he declined on grounds of ill health. He died in Wynberg on 17 March 1821 and was buried in the Somerset Road cemetery, Cape Town. Not a wealthy man, he had failed to achieve his ambition of ensuring that his family could reacquire a landed estate in Scotland, but was a highly respected military officer. His memorials are a marble cenotaph at the entrance to the cathedral of St Michael and St George in Grahamstown&#151;and the city of Grahamstown itself.<br>
