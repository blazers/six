<span class="headword">Copley,  Thomas</span>  (1532&#150;1584), <span class="occ">landowner and Roman Catholic exile</span>, was born between February and May 1532, eldest son of Sir Roger Copley (<i>d</i>. 1549), landowner and member of the Mercers' Company, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1559/60), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25315/', "Sir William Shelley")</script> of Michelgrove, Sussex, judge of common pleas. He was related to Elizabeth I by common descent from Thomas, last Lord Hoo and Hastings, and he was a kinsman of both William Cecil Lord Burghley and Francis Walsingham. In 1547 he was admitted to the Inner Temple where, in 1561, he served as marshal for its &#145;grand and solemn Christmas&#146;  (Inderwick, 219). His father had settled the manor and parliamentary borough of Gatton, Surrey, on his mother. She controlled elections and returned Thomas to the Marian parliaments of April and November 1554, and the parliament of 1558. After her death he returned himself to the Elizabethan parliaments of 1559 and 1563&#150;7.<br>
<br>To his inheritance, which included Gatton, the Maze (Southwark), and estates in Sussex and Lincolnshire, Copley added the Surrey manors of Chipstead, Colley, and Merstham. He was extravagant as he acknowledged, spending on &#145;costly building, chargeable music, horses, and such like vanities&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1580&#150;1625</i>, vol. 27, no. 55). He was also impulsive. During the Inner Temple reader's dinner in 1556, when London's lord mayor was present, Copley and others made off with the mayoral sword of honour. They were imprisoned and expelled from the society. He was readmitted only after his &#145;humble suit and submission&#146;  (Inderwick, 187). When, on 5 March 1558, during the childless Catholic Mary's last parliament, he spoke out as an ardent protestant in defence of Princess Elizabeth's right to succeed her, he was imprisoned, although he pleaded his youth as a mitigating circumstance. Instead of contracting the expected marriage alliance with his powerful neighbours, the Howards of Effingham, later that year, about July, he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. in or after 1590), the Catholic daughter and coheir of Sir John Luttrell of Dunster, Somerset.<br>
<br>When Princess Elizabeth became queen Copley enjoyed royal favour. He was appointed commissioner of the peace for Surrey (1559&#150;68) and in 1561 Elizabeth was godmother to his heir, Henry. However, about 1563, according to the Spanish ambassador, he converted to Roman Catholicism. Robert Persons (<span class="italic">Relation of a Trial between the Bishop of Evreux and the Lord Plessis Mornay</span>, 1604) attributed his conversion to the errors which he detected in Bishop Jewel's <span class="italic">Apology</span> (1562 in Latin, 1564 in English). Copley was fined and imprisoned for recusancy. In 1569 he advised his fellow justices that he could not subscribe to the supremacy and uniformity acts and in 1570 he went abroad without royal licence. By then his translations from the church fathers entitled <span class="italic">Certaine Treaties &hellip; Touching the Doctrine of Good Workes</span> (1569) and <span class="italic">A Treatise of Justification</span> (1569) had been published in Louvain. Copley's stated intention was to achieve religious unity; his <span class="italic">Certain Treaties</span> was a defence of justification by faith and good works rather than a vituperative attack on protestants.<br>
<br>Copley remained abroad, moving between the Low Countries, France, and Spain, until his death. During that time he frequently corresponded with the queen, Burghley, Walsingham, and others about his dilemma: although a devout Catholic he was a loyal subject whose unauthorized absence made him liable to statutory forfeiture of property for life. Necessity, he protested, obliged him to serve foreign princes. His integrity and loyalty, however, were widely doubted. &#145;A prime man among the English Fugitives&#146;  (Camden, 372), he was paid a Spanish pension, ennobled by Philip II as grand master of the Maes (Maze in Southwark) and lord of Gatton, made a baron and knight by the French king, and granted Spanish letters of marque against the Dutch rebels. Meanwhile the Howards benefited from his property and he received no income from it. He died on 25 September 1584 at the Spanish military camp near Antwerp. As his eldest son had died young he named his son William as his heir in his will (1576), and bequests were made to his daughters, Margaret, Helen, and Mary. In a codicil of 1577 provision was also made for his youngest sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6268/', "Anthony Copley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6270/', "John Copley")</script>.<br>

<a name="cosubject_6274"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Copley</span>  (<em>b. </em>1594, <em>d.</em> in or after 1652), <span class="occ">Jesuit and colonist in America</span>, was born in Madrid, eldest son of William Copley (1565&#150;1643) and Magdalen Pickering (<i>d</i>. 1610), and grandson of Thomas Copley, the Roman Catholic exile. His family returned to Gatton in 1603, but eight years later he left for Louvain, where John Gerard had become rector of the Jesuits there. Copley made his noviceship at Li&egrave;ge and was admitted to the society; perhaps at that point, he surrendered his rights as heir to his younger brother William. By 1623 or 1624 &#145;Father Copley [who] hath newly taken orders and come from beyond seas&#146; was recorded as living in London  (Dorsey, 41). Thereafter nothing is known of him until the 1630s. He was still in London in December 1634, when he petitioned Charles I that he was &#145;an alien born&#146; and therefore should not be molested or arrested for his religion &#145;whilst following occasions which concern his father and his own estate&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, vol. 278, no. 1). The king granted a warrant which afforded him personal protection until, in 1637, he sailed for the Maryland settlement, which had been established four years earlier.<br>
<br>Copley's life in Maryland was one of contrasts. He transported forty-eight men which enabled him to claim and receive 10,000 acres of land. As a Jesuit father he was prominent in establishing stations such as St Inigoes, St Thomas Manor, and Mattapony, in the new colony, ministering to settlers and providing spiritual counsel. At the same time, contrary to proprietary instructions to keep religion a private matter, he was active in worldly affairs on behalf of the Society of Jesus, importing goods to exchange with Indians for pelts, bringing out &#145;servants&#146; and taking up more land, owning houses, suing and being sued in the lawcourts, and claiming cash and chattels at the death of men whose transportation he had funded. The proprietor, Lord Baltimore, approved of proposed laws, presented to the Maryland assembly in 1637&#150;8 and 1638&#150;9, to limit the Jesuits' political and economic activities. Copley appears to have been actively involved in marshalling resistance to them. Late in his life (August 1650) he demanded 20,000 acres of land for transporting sixty men to Maryland and in 1651 he was defendant in a lawsuit. He was unsuccessful in both. In November 1652 he bound himself to pay the debts of one Paul Simpson. He died in Maryland, though his date of death is uncertain and his burial place is unknown.<br>
<br>The alias Philip Fisher has been ascribed to Thomas Copley by Foley, McCoog, Land, and others, but it was not accepted by Copley's biographer, Katherine Dorsey.<br>
