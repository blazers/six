<span class="headword">Stenhouse,  John</span>  (1809&#150;1880), <span class="occ">chemist and inventor</span>, was born on 21 October 1809 at Glasgow, the eldest son and only surviving child of William Stenhouse, a calico printer of Barrhead, Glasgow, and his wife, Elizabeth Currie (<i>d</i>. 1860). He was educated at Glasgow grammar school and at Glasgow University (1824&#150;8), where he studied chemistry under Dr Thomas Thomson. He continued his studies at Anderson's University under Thomas Graham and at Giessen (1837&#150;9) under Liebig with Lyon Playfair and Robert Angus Smith. In 1839 he returned to Glasgow, where he remained until he lost his inherited fortune when the Commercial Exchange failed and was thus led to seek employment.<br>
<br>In 1850 Aberdeen University made Stenhouse LLD, and in the same year he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester. In 1851 he went to London as lecturer on chemistry at St Bartholomew's Hospital, but resigned his post in 1857, owing to an attack of paralysis. During his tenure at St Bartholomew's, August Kekul&eacute; (1829&#150;1896), later a leading German organic chemist, was a visiting assistant there; Stenhouse and he did research together. After his resignation he went to Italy, where he resided with his mother until her death in 1860. Returning to London, he fitted up a laboratory and pursued a vigorous programme of scientific investigation. In 1865 he succeeded A. W. Hofmann as non-resident assayer to the Royal Mint. He held the post until it was abolished in 1870, when he was granted a civil-list pension.<br>
<br>In November 1871 Stenhouse was awarded the Royal Society's royal medal. He was one of the founders of the Chemical Society in 1841, was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1848, and became a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry in 1877. During the last four years of his life Stenhouse suffered a form of rheumatism of the eyelids, which compelled him to live in a darkened room, but he always bore his infirmities with patience. He died on 31 December 1880 at his home, 17 Rodney Street, Pentonville, London, and was buried in the High Church new cemetery, Glasgow, on 6 January 1881.<br>
<br>Stenhouse wrote more than a hundred papers on chemical subjects, many of them in conjunction with C. E. Groves. He was primarily interested in the organic compounds derived from plants, especially lichens, and was the discoverer of betorcinol, a homologue of orcinol. He patented many ingenious and useful inventions in dyeing, waterproofing, sugar manufacture, and tanning, but he was principally known for his application of the absorbent properties of wood charcoal to disinfecting and deodorizing purposes in the form of charcoal air-filters and charcoal respirators, which proved useful in many contexts.<br>
