<span class="headword">Mason,  (Frances) Agnes</span>  (1849&#150;1941), <span class="occ">founder of the Community of the Holy Family</span>, was born at the parsonage, Laugharne township, Carmarthenshire, on 10 August 1849, the second daughter in the family of three daughters and four sons of George William Mason (1819&#150;1891), justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant, of Morton Hall, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Marianne Atherton, daughter of Joseph George Mitford of Laugharne. Her family was active in Church of England causes. Her eldest brother, William Henry Mason (1846&#150;1936), was a member of the Woodard Corporation; another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34917/', "Arthur James Mason")</script>, was a divinity professor at Cambridge; her elder sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48847/', "(Marianne) Harriet Mason")</script>, had a career in social work. Between 1876 and 1883 Agnes gained experience of social and educational work while assisting her brother (George) Edward Mason (1847&#150;1928) in his parish at Whitwell, Derbyshire, where he was rector. In 1883 she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, taking the moral sciences tripos with second-class honours in 1886. For two years (1886&#150;8) she was lecturer in mental and moral science at Bedford College, London, and then taught privately in London until 1892. She was secretary to the Guild of the Epiphany, founded by Canon Francis Holland for religious teaching, from 1887 until 1895 when she resigned in order to found the Anglican Community of the Holy Family.<br>
<br>Agnes Mason was first called to found the community while visiting Florence. It was to be dedicated to the religious teaching of women of all ages, worldwide, and to be expressly for scholars and artists. In this calling she was helped by Frederick Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Gore, bishop of Oxford, William Collins, bishop of Gibraltar, Walter Frere, bishop of Truro, George Congreve of the Society of St John the Evangelist, Charles Lindley Wood, second Viscount Halifax, president of the English Church Union, and the Roman Catholic theologian Baron von H&uuml;gel. With the help of von H&uuml;gel she was able to study the methods of the Sisters of the Assumption in Paris and a congregation of teaching Dominicanesses at Nancy. The four novices of the Community of the Holy Family were professed on 19 October 1898, Temple being celebrant, Gore as gospeller, and Arthur Mason, her brother, as epistoler. Following her immediate election by the sisters, Agnes Mason was installed by the archbishop as their mother superior.<br>
<br>Mother Agnes Mason was drawn to biblical studies in Greek and Hebrew, and also the mystics, such as St Teresa of Avila, whose <span class="italic">Foundations</span> she translated from the Spanish in 1909, St John of the Cross, Gertrude More, and Julian of Norwich. She published essays in <span class="italic">Theology</span> (1922&#150;36), various devotional works, including <span class="italic">The Way of Beauty</span> (1920), and school books for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Herself a fine watercolourist, Mother Agnes collected the works of Myra Luxmoore, and purchased sepia photographs of Italian art in Florence for use in teaching. Later she arranged for artist sisters to teach in the community's school in India, Naini Tal, and on their journey spend time in Florence to study its religious art.<br>
<br>The community's rule drawn up by Mother Agnes is probably the best among the Anglican communities. Learned, yet joyous, it quotes Shakespeare, &#145;Who chooses me must give and hazard all he hath&#146;. The rule states that &#145;Every Sister ought to be so systematically studying at least one subject that she makes real progress from month to month&#146;, and elsewhere affirms that &#145;A sin against beauty is a sin against God&#146;. In 1911 she gained the Lambeth diploma in theology by thesis, the sisters of her community shaping, and tutoring in, that programme from its beginning. Though the community never became large, the excellent scholarship of its sisters ensured that it prospered. There were schools at London and then, from 1913, at St Leonards, and at All Saints' College, Naini Tal, India (1915&#150;45), and houses of study at Leeds (1906&#150;11), and then Cambridge (1911&#150;39). The house of prayer at St Pega's Hermitage, Peakirk, Northamptonshire, was given to the community by Miss Bertha James in 1937. In 1913 the community acquired its mother house, Holmhurst St Mary, St Leonards, Sussex, where Agnes Mason, who was mother superior until 1933, died on 19 December 1941. She was buried in the community's graveyard under a cross of Sussex oak.<br>
