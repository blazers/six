<span class="headword">Pycroft,  James</span>  (1813&#150;1895), <span class="occ">writer on cricket</span>, was born at Geyers House, Pickwick, Wiltshire, the second son of Thomas Pycroft, barrister, and his wife, Mary. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22916/', "Thomas Pycroft")</script>. He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Bath, matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, in 1831, and graduated BA in 1836. After four years (1836&#150;40) studying law at Lincoln's Inn he was ordained into the Church of England in 1840. On 8 July 1843 he married Ann, the widow of F. P. Alleyn; she later predeceased him. He taught at the collegiate school, Leicester, for five years, held a curacy (1845) at Chardstock, Dorset, and was perpetual curate&#151;a technicality giving him freehold&#151;of St Mary Magdalen, Barnstaple, Devon, from 1845 to 1856. He held no other clerical preferments, and lived for the rest of his life at Bathwick, Bath, and then Brighton.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Pycroft was partly responsible for the revival in 1836 after a lapse of seven years of the cricket match between Oxford and Cambridge, and opened the batting at Lord's himself. A month earlier he had made his own highest recorded score, 85 not out, for Non-Wykehamists against Wykehamists at Oxford. He made one further appearance at Lord's, in 1838, for Left-Handed Batsmen against the MCC. He described himself as having as much right &#145;as anyone&#146; to be a founder of the Lansdown club in Bath, and in his last match for them he countered some gentle barracking from the fielders for his slow batting by remarking &#145;I'll tell you what, gentlemen; I am here to guard three stumps and claim to play accordingly&#146;.<br>
<br>Pycroft's career as a writer began while still an undergraduate at Oxford. In 1835 he published anonymously <span class="italic">The Principles of Scientific Batting</span>. This contained a formal set of rules on how to bat, together with some dietary advice for cricketers: &#145;Ale and porter render the eye dull&#146;. But it was through his <span class="italic">The Cricket Field</span> (1851) that his reputation as a cricket writer became established. It ran to nine editions (1851&#150;1887), including one published in Boston (1859) to coincide with the game's period of popularity in the United States in the ante-bellum era. The book was both a historical essay on the game's origins and a manual of instruction. Soon after leaving Oxford, Pycroft had visited the Surrey and Hampshire villages associated with cricket in the eighteenth century, such as Hambledon. He had met William Beldham, the last survivor of that era; and John Mitford had given him his own notes, containing the reminiscences of William Fennex, another Hambledon player, while Pycroft himself had &#145;man and boy played and watched the game&#146;. The instructional pages were a development of his earlier book.<br>
<br>Pycroft's other cricket writing consisted in his regular contributions to the journal <span class="italic">Cricket</span> and to the <span class="italic">Cricketers' Companion</span> and <span class="italic">Cricketers' Annual</span>, issued regularly by the publishing family of Lillywhite. There was some repetition of material from the earlier years, a feature of his conversation as well. Nevertheless, to the end of his life people, especially the young, were attracted to hear what he might have to say while attending some match at Lord's or Brighton.<br>
<br>Pycroft also wrote five novels, of which <span class="italic">Twenty Years in the Church</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">Elkington Rectory</span> (1860) are semi-autobiographical. Where cricket is mentioned, it is seen as a vehicle of social cohesion &#145;to encourage sympathy between man and man however wide their ranks might be set asunder&#146;. The novels illustrate Anglican optimism and clerical paternalism, and contain parallels with the novels of Anthony Trollope. They were well received by reviewers but had no lasting appeal. During his schoolmastering years he also published textbooks on Greek and Latin grammar and the reading of English. His <span class="italic">Oxford Memories</span> (2 vols., 1886) provide a fascinating&#151;even colloquial&#151;account of the university in his day and of his later cricketing associations.<br>
<br>Pycroft saw cricket &#145;as a standing panegyric on the English character&#146; and a test of mental ability and manly fibre. In this he was at one with Charles Wordsworth, one of the early exponents of the concept of muscular Christianity, who established the first university cricket match in 1827. The essayist E. V. Lucas remembered seeing Pycroft in old age, &#145;a tall, erect and clerical figure, clad always in black, with a cape and a silk hat, pure white hair and a fringe of white whisker&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hambledon Men</span>, 1907, xvii). Pycroft died of influenza at his home, Dudley Mansions, Lansdown Place, Brighton, on 10 March 1895.<br>
