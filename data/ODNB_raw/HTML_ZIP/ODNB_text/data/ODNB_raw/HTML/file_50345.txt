<span class="headword">Blois,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1236), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, is of unknown parentage, though it is probable that he was related to William de Blois, bishop of Lincoln (1203&#150;6), under whom he served as archdeacon of Buckingham; this position he retained until his own election to the see of Worcester. He seems to have gained little else in the way of ecclesiastical preferment during this period, holding only the prebend of Sutton by virtue of his position as archdeacon, and the church of Swallow, Norfolk, at the presentation of Sir Thomas de Lascelle. By 1218 he had obtained a university degree, although it is not clear whether he studied at Paris, where the elder William de Blois had taught, or at Oxford.<br>
<br>William's election in 1218 was not welcomed by the chapter of Worcester Cathedral priory, who declared that he had been forced upon them by the papal legate, Guala; and he was accepted only after the intervention of Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury. On 28 October he was enthroned, and began an episcopate distinguished by his dedication to reform and by conflict with the monastic chapter. The years up to 1224 were marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral priory. In 1220 the bishop tried, unsuccessfully, to depose the prior, and throughout the following year there were complaints of numerous injuries inflicted upon the monks. The priory's claim to have papal letters stating that the prior could not be removed except through papal judges-delegate led to a hearing at Rome, and the suspension of Prior Simon, whom the bishop replaced with William Norman. Although Simon's suspension was lifted through the offices of the archbishop of Canterbury, William Norman remained as prior, and opposition to him grew. Hence, in 1224, an agreement was made between the bishop and the priory, and a new system for the appointment of the prior was established&#151;one which was to last into the fifteenth century. The cathedral monks were to nominate seven candidates from among their own number, from whom the bishop would choose one. All eventualities, including the bishop's absence from the country, were provided for. This settlement marked the end of active antagonism between the two parties.<br>
<br>As bishop, William de Blois himself was absent from England only twice: once in 1222, when he is said to have journeyed to Rome, for the hearing caused by his attempted deposition of Prior Simon, and again when he attended the Cistercian general chapter in 1228. He seems to have had little interest in politics, dedicating himself to his episcopal duties. The rebuilding of the east end of Worcester Cathedral was begun during his episcopate, and although it is unclear how far he was involved in this personally, he was certainly responsible for the building of the chapel to St Thomas, a free-standing structure to the north of the cathedral. He demonstrated an enthusiasm for church reform: at least four diocesan synods were held during his episcopate, in 1219, 1220, 1229, and 1232, and on at least two of these occasions he issued diocesan statutes, laying down guidelines for the effective administration of the see. He also proved himself a determined monastic visitor. It is certain that he visited three monasteries&#151;Worcester Priory itself, St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol, and Great Malvern. In the last instance he demonstrated his resolution by gaining admittance in 1233 despite the monks' opposition, and by returning the following year. William died on 17 August 1236, at the episcopal manor of Alvechurch, Worcestershire. A tomb monument, said to be his, remains in the lady chapel of Worcester Cathedral.<br>
