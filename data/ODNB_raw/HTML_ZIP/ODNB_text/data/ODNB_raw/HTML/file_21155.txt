<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paley,  William</span>  (1743&#150;1805), <span class="occ">theologian and moralist</span>, was born in July 1743 in Peterborough and baptized on 30 August in Peterborough Cathedral, the only son and eldest of four children of William Paley (1711&#150;1799) and Elizabeth Clapham (1713?&#150;1796), both of Giggleswick in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The elder Paley was a sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, the traditional place of learning for Paley men since the early seventeenth century, where he graduated BA in 1733. In 1735 he became vicar of Helpston, Northamptonshire, and went to live in nearby Peterborough where he was a minor canon of the cathedral. In 1745 he was appointed headmaster of the free grammar school in Giggleswick, a post he held until his death, and it was here that his son received his early schooling. Paley was a studious boy, who displayed an early interest in mechanical ingenuity and whose principal amusement was angling. On 16 November 1758 he was admitted as a sizar to Christ's, with the benefit of a scholarship from Giggleswick. Before beginning his residence at Christ's in October 1759, he studied geometry and algebra with William Howarth at Topcliffe, near Ripon. Paley's father commented to one of his pupils that he expected his son to &#145;turn out a great man&#151;very great indeed&#151;I'm certain of it; for he has by far the <i>clearest</i> head I ever met with in my life&#146;  (Meadley, 4).<h2>
<a name="Cambridgeyears"></a>Cambridge years</h2>Paley's interest in mathematics continued at Cambridge. In classics he was not so well trained, but his training was sufficient for his needs. To the Giggleswick scholarship he added a foundation scholarship and a Mildmay exhibition. At Cambridge he enjoyed a certain celebrity; his powers of conversation and good humour, just as often directed against himself as others, made him an easy companion. On his own admission he spent the first two years at Cambridge &#145;happily, but unprofitably&#146;, frequently in society &#145;where we were not immoral, but idle and rather expensive&#146;  (Lynan, 1.5). His provincial dress and manners were a source of fun to his fellow students, but the superiority of his mind was soon discovered. At the commencement of his third year Paley was rescued by the intervention of a friend, who chided him that he was a fool for wasting his talents and threatened to cut him off if he did not change his ways. The admonishment seems to have had some effect. On 26 May 1761 Paley was awarded the Bunting scholarship, the highest mathematical prize offered at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Paley's formal studies at Cambridge were conducted under the Plumian professor Anthony Shepherd (algebra, geometry, and natural philosophy) and William Backhouse (logic, metaphysics, and moral philosophy). To compete for honours an undergraduate was required to engage in a number of &#145;acts&#146; and &#145;opponencies&#146;. For one of these public disputations in Latin his opponent was John Frere, who was second to Paley in the mathematical tripos of 1763. Paley discussed whether eternal punishment was contradictory to the divine attributes. The fluent delivery of his thesis and strength of conception were the ingredients of his success, and in June 1763 he graduated as senior wrangler.<br>
<br>From 1763 to 1765 Paley was a schoolmaster's assistant and then a Latin tutor at Bracken's academy in Greenwich, specializing in preparing boys for the military. For recreation he attended trials at the Old Bailey and visited the theatre, particularly when Garrick was on stage, an entertainment he enjoyed throughout his life. In 1765 he won one of the Cambridge members' prizes offered for the best dissertations in Latin prose by senior bachelors. His subject was &#145;A comparison between the Stoic and Epicurean philosophy, with respect to the influence of each on the morals of the people&#146;; he argued that the Epicurean philosophy was more favourable to virtue and happiness, and characterized the Stoics as &#145;Pharisees in philosophy&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.50). The dissertation concluded with a eulogy of Christian faith, including an imitation of a sentence from Locke with respect to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>: &#145;It has God for its author; salvation for its end: and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter&#146;  (Lynan, 1.11). Paley nearly lost the prize because he added notes in English, raising a suspicion that the essay was plagiarized. It is often said that this critique of the ancient moralists revealed an emerging utilitarianism. In the same year Paley left Bracken's academy after being ordained deacon and appointed assistant curate to John Hinchliffe, vicar of Greenwich and afterwards bishop of Peterborough. In Paley's lexicon curates were &#145;rats&#146;, and he referred to himself as a &#145;rat of rats&#146; suffering from &#145;rat sickness&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.63). For a time he continued working as a private tutor in Greenwich; one of his favourite pupils, John Ord, remembered him as his &#145;much loved friend and as it were a second father&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1809, 103).<br>
<br>On 24 June 1766 Paley became a fellow of Christ's, where Shepherd was now master, returned to Cambridge to take his MA, and remained there for the next ten years, during which time he earned a reputation as one of the university's most popular teachers. Among his closest friends at Cambridge were John Law, John Jebb, and Edward Waring. Law was the son of the theologian Edmund Law, then master of Peterhouse, and Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy; Jebb was a fellow of Peterhouse and the chief voice of reform at Cambridge; and Waring was the Lucasian professor, whose <span class="italic">Miscellanae analytica</span> Paley later helped correct for the press. In 1767 Paley became praelector at Christ's (a position he held until 1779), junior dean, and catechist, and Bunting, Walhampton, and Knapwell preacher. He was ordained priest by the bishop of London on 21 December 1767, and the following year he and John Law were appointed assistant tutors under Shepherd, with Paley as senior Greek lecturer teaching Backhouse's old courses in ethics, metaphysics, and the Greek <span class="roman">Testament</span>. Soon after, he was appointed steward, Mildmay preacher, and Hebrew lecturer. The last position, which Paley held from 1768 to 1770, was probably a sinecure, since he appears to have known little of the Hebrew language. In 1769 he was appointed chaplain to Edmund Law, newly elevated to the bishopric of Carlisle, and in 1771 was nominated one of the preachers at the Royal Chapel, Whitehall, a position he retained until 1776. He held the university post of taxor for the year 1770&#150;71. The most senior post held by Paley at Christ's was senior dean, to which he was appointed in 1775.<br>
<br>For his lectures on ethics Paley compiled his own material, later revised and reorganized for <span class="italic">The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy</span> (1785). For first-year metaphysics he used Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, then went on to Clarke's <span class="italic">On the Being and Attributes of God</span> and Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy of Religion</span>. All undergraduates at Christ's were required to attend Paley's Greek <span class="roman">Testament</span> lectures twice a week, for which he drew substantially on Locke's <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span>. The main point on which he insisted, a student later recalled, was &#145;that we should listen to God, not to man; that we should exert our faculties in understanding the language of holy men of old &hellip; and we should not call any our master in religion but Jesus Christ&#146;. The same student recalled that as a lecturer &#145;the driest subjects were made interesting&#146; by Paley, and notes from his lectures were highly sought after  (&#145;Anecdotes of Dr Paley&#146;, 414&#150;17).<br>
<br>While a fellow at Cambridge, Paley joined the Hyson Club, established by the wranglers of 1757, where he &#145;contributed to the general stock of brilliancy and merriment&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.68). The members of the club met to drink hyson (green tea) and engage in &#145;rational conversation&#146;, and were mainly reform-minded latitudinarian Cambridge men, including Edmund and John Law, Jebb, and Richard Watson, the moderator who examined Paley's dispute with John Frere. The Hyson was at the centre of the controversy over subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, which began in 1766 with the publication of Francis Blackburne's <span class="italic">The Confessional</span>. Five years of continued public debate culminated in the subscription meetings held at the Feathers tavern in London. The subsequent petition called for the liberty of every man to judge for himself to subscribe without penalty. Signed by almost all the members of the Hyson, it was presented to parliament in January 1772 by a group of Anglican clergy led by Jebb. Although Paley did not sign the petition on the regrettably flippant grounds that he &#145;could not afford to keep a conscience&#146;  (Meadley, 89), his general disposition on toleration was commonly known through his university lectures. In 1774 he defended Edmund Law against the criticisms of Thomas Randolph, Lady Margaret professor of divinity and president of Corpus Christi College, in an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">A defence of the &#145;Considerations on the propriety of requiring a subscription to articles of faith&#146;</span> (1774). An early biographer dismissed it as &#145;written with a spirit of contemptuous superiority, and in the boldest tone of latitudinarian inquiry&#146;, the arguments of which &#145;will satisfy none but lax consciences&#146;  (Lynan, 1.16, 27). The arguments for toleration and free enquiry contained in this pamphlet stand as a summary of the position of the reformers, and were repeated later in a brief chapter in the <span class="italic">Principles</span>, criticized by the radical Gilbert Wakefield as a &#145;shuffling chapter on subscription&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.75). In 1776 Paley's &#145;Observations upon the character and example of Christ, with an appendix on the morality of the gospel&#146; was printed privately and bound together with Edmund Law's &#145;Reflections on the life and character of Christ&#146;, and distributed among the students at Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="Clericalcareer"></a>Clerical career</h2>Paley's connection with the Law family greatly advanced his clerical career. He regularly spent vacations with John Law while they were Cambridge fellows, and they once met John Wilkes on one of their excursions to Bath and enjoyed an evening with him. Paley's &#145;long and faithful friendship&#146; with Law was acknowledged in the dedication to <span class="italic">Horae Paulinae</span> (1790). In 1777 Paley was invited to preach the visitation sermon in Carlisle Cathedral for Edmund Law, and in 1782 he preached the sermon at John Law's consecration as bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh. Both John and Edmund Law encouraged Paley to revise his lectures on ethics for publication, and the <span class="italic">Principles</span> was dedicated to the bishop of Carlisle. When the bishop died at Rose Castle in Carlisle in 1787 Paley wrote a short memoir of his life, which afterward appeared in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. The Law connection extended to the prelate's third son, Edward, later Lord Ellenborough and lord chief justice of the king's bench, whom Paley is said to have aided in his study of the law.<br>
<br>It was at John Law's Carlisle residence that Paley met Jane Hewitt (1751?&#150;1791), the daughter of a local spirit merchant, and they were married by Law on 6 June 1776. Initially they settled in Appleby, Westmorland, near Great Musgrave where Paley had been appointed to his first benefice by Bishop Law on 8 May 1775. The marriage produced a family of four sons and four daughters, including Edmund (1782&#150;1850), his father's biographer. Paley once remarked: &#145;though I am a pluralist in preferment, I am a much greater pluralist in children&#146;  (Meadley, 161). Edmund later wrote of his mother, who died in May 1791, &#145;Sensible, but mild and unassuming, of retired habits, of a sweet and negative disposition, but inactive from ill health, and, as she used to call herself, a mere thread-paper wife&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.91).<br>
<br>In Paley pluralism was coupled with indifference to elevation in the church. Though he gained much in his career through patronage, he coined the term &#145;rooting&#146; for &#145;that baseness and servility which like swine rooting in a dunghill will perform the basest acts for a rich patron, to gain his protection and good benefice&#146;  (&#145;Anecdotes of Dr Paley&#146;, 511). Towards the end of 1776 Bishop Law presented Paley with the vicarage of Dalston, Cumberland, and the following year he was favoured by the dean and chapter of Carlisle with a more substantial benefice, the vicarage of St Lawrence, Appleby. Paley resigned Musgrave, which he attended only rarely to preach, and thereafter divided his time equally between Dalston and Appleby, until he resigned the latter in 1785. He often declared that he had passed some of the happiest days of his life in Appleby.<br>
<br>In June 1780 Paley was appointed to a prebendary stall in Carlisle Cathedral, and on 29 July 1781 preached a general ordination sermon there. It was published in 1783, and was afterwards recommended to those preparing for holy orders &#145;as a correct standard by which they may examine their resolutions&#146;  (Lynan, 1.19). In August 1782 he succeeded his friend John Law as archdeacon of Carlisle, after the latter's elevation to the Irish bench, and with it acquired the vicarage of Great Salkeld, Cumberland. About this time he published anonymously a help manual for the clergy of Carlisle, perhaps originating from his own pastoral experience, <span class="italic">The Clergyman's Companion in Visiting the Sick</span>, a selection from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> with extracts from the works of eminent divines. Paley held the archdeaconry until 1805. At the end of 1785 he was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Carlisle, succeeding Richard Burn, author of <span class="italic">The Justice of the Peace</span>.<br>
<br>Residing mainly in Carlisle, Paley enjoyed a diverse and agreeable society of friends and neighbours, paid close attention to the well-being of the local clergy, and was noted for the liberality with which he treated his curates. As chancellor Paley was responsible for the ecclesiastical courts, involving cases of clergy discipline and matrimonial and testamentary cases. He worked to establish a dispensary in the town, and promoted Sunday schools. The latter initiative led to a charge of plagiarism over a cheap compendium of materials for the schools which Paley compiled from the writings of various authors. He did not accept any money from the sales of this volume, and apologised to the Revd J. Robertson, one of the original authors, for unknowingly offending him, although the lessons in spelling he borrowed hardly constituted the plagiarism of which he was charged. From Carlisle, Paley frequently rode to Dalston, but he was a poor horseman and took little pleasure in the journey, save that he thought it good exercise. Summers were spent in the vicarage at Dalston, where he fished, farmed, and worked in the garden.<br>
<br>In 1789 Bishop Yorke of Ely offered Paley the mastership of Jesus College, Cambridge. He declined because he was satisfied with his situation at Carlisle, commenting that the bishop was &#145;a man I know no more of than I do the pope&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.95). John Law thought the decision hasty, on the grounds that this might be Paley's last chance for preferment. The offer is acknowledged in Paley's dedication of <span class="italic">A View of the Evidences of Christianity</span> (1794), a work generally praised as a masterpiece of Christian apologetics, and which confirmed his reputation as one of England's most respected theologians. In May 1791 Paley was presented to the vicarage of Addingham, near Great Salkeld, by the dean and chapter of Carlisle, and in 1793 he vacated Dalston for the vicarage of Stanwix, near Carlisle, to which he was presented by the new bishop, Vernon. Paley's annual income was about &pound;900 at this time, a princely sum by the standards of the day. In August 1794 Bishop Porteus of London, a fellow with Paley at Christ's College and an admirer of <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span>, gave him the prebend of St Pancras in St Paul's Cathedral. Also in recognition of this book, in January 1795 Bishop Pretyman presented Paley to the subdeanery of Lincoln, the additional income from which permitted him to resign his prebend and the chancellorship at Carlisle. <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> led to a doctorate of divinity from Cambridge in 1795, and the honour of preaching the commencement sermon before the university. On 14 March Paley acquired one of the most valuable livings in England, the rectory of Bishopwearmouth in the gift of Bishop Barrington of Durham, at which time he resigned from Stanwix and Addingham. The gift was repaid in the dedication of <span class="italic">Natural Theology</span> (1802). In Bishopwearmouth Paley met the good friend of his final years, George Wilson Meadley, a banker and merchant of liberal views who later wrote his life. On 14 December 1795 Paley married Catherine Dobinson (1748?&#150;1819) of Carlisle, and thereafter divided the year between Bishopwearmouth and Lincoln.<br>
<br>In Lincoln, Paley was an active member of the local literary society and served as a magistrate. In the latter capacity his assertive manner served him well, although his main effort appears to have been directed unsuccessfully against the indiscriminate licensing of public houses, the consequences of which he often witnessed from the bench. In 1799 he assisted in measures to help the poor deal with food scarcities. Paley's value to the intellectual life of Lincoln was not doubted, but some thought him lacking in the dignity appropriate to a man of his station: &#145;The familiarity of his manners, his almost perpetual jests, his approximations to coarseness of language, weakened the splendour of his literary reputation&#146;  (Best, 182). Others appreciated his bluntness and self-deprecatory manner.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Paley is best known as an orthodox theologian and utilitarian moralist, who tended to support established institutions but was progressive on questions of toleration and humanity. The popularity of his writings was due in part to his natural and easy style, but also to the fact that his philosophy expressed the leading scientific, theological, and ethical ideas of the day. He was a master at making complex philosophical positions accessible to a wider audience. As his son remarked: &#145;Christianity is treated as it would offer itself to the illiterate fisherman, or the ignorant natural man. Moral Philosophy is brought to the level of common sense&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.73). A contemporary commented that the <span class="italic">Principles</span> &#145;presents a subject which has always been considered as harsh and difficult, in the most agreeable and intelligible form &hellip; we sit down to be informed of our duty, and are surprised to meet with amusement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Characters</span>, 118).<br>
<br>Paley pointed out that his books should be read in the reverse order from that in which they were written. Thus the moral and political philosophy of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> is grounded in the revelation of the scriptures, the subject matter of <span class="italic">Horae Paulinae</span> and <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span>. In turn, this revealed theology is underpinned by the natural philosophy of the <span class="italic">Natural Theology</span>, in which knowledge of the attributes of the deity is derived from an empirical study of nature. In these works Paley posited a rationally ordered, purposeful, and divinely legitimated universe, assumptions later restated in a selection of the <span class="roman">Bridgewater Treatises</span> of the 1830s.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Principles</span> was written in a forceful and clear style, which readily suited it for adoption as a textbook at Cambridge, with the consequence that the principle of utility penetrated the teaching of morality at the university. &#145;Whatever is expedient, is right&#146;, taught Paley. &#145;It is the utility of any moral rule alone, which constitutes the obligation of it&#146;  (W. Paley, <span class="italic">The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy</span>, 1785, 161). The practice of virtue was supported by the expectations of a futurity in which there would be a proportionable accession of happiness. In developing this theory Paley owned that he drew upon many different sources and acknowledged a particular debt to Abraham Tucker. He also borrowed material from Thomas Rutherforth's <span class="italic">Institutes of Natural Law</span> and was influenced by Locke, Gay, Hartley, and his patron Bishop Law. From Law he took his definition of virtue: &#145;the doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness&#146; (ibid., 35; quoting Law, lii). His arguments underpinning moral and political obligation were thrown into question by the provocative and often misunderstood pigeon analogy in the Cambridge lectures of 1773&#150;4. The depiction of ninety-nine pigeons gathering food for &#145;the weakest perhaps and worst pigeon of the flock&#146;  (ibid., 91), which he used to justify the inequality of property, was understood by some to be a criticism of monarchy, and caused John Law to warn Paley that it might cost him a bishopric. &#145;Bishop or no bishop&#146;, replied the author, &#145;it shall stand&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, l.341). Paley was paid handsomely for the copyright to this popular text, and exulted: &#145;Little did I think that I should ever make a thousand pounds by any book of mine&#146;  (Lynan, 1.21). The appearance of the <span class="italic">Principles</span>, with its religious and conservative utilitarian moral and political philosophy, prompted Jeremy Bentham to issue his own secular utilitarian and reformist <span class="italic">Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</span> in 1789.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Horae Paulinae</span> and <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> were concerted attempts to prove the credibility of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> as a historical record of revelation. In <span class="italic">Horae Paulinae</span> Paley showed he was thoroughly versed in St Paul's teachings, to which he applied a good deal of original criticism. He mounted a detailed comparison between Paul's epistles and the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>, concluding that the similarities between the two reinforced the authenticity of the testimony they contained. In so doing he demonstrated that Paul's letters were not the contrived product of a personal or political agenda but rather were an authentic source of early Christian history. <span class="italic">Horae Paulinae</span> was translated into German in 1797, by 1810 had gone through ten editions, and appeared in numerous editions throughout the nineteenth century. The arguments of this work were later challenged by Bentham in <span class="italic">Not Paul, but Jesus</span> (1823).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> was principally directed against Hume's scepticism concerning the grounds for belief in miracles, arguing for the reliability of the apostles' testimony. Paley's general approach was based on the four rules of biblical criticism laid down by the nonjuror Charles Leslie, and he also drew upon Bishop Lardner's <span class="italic">Credibility of the Gospel History</span>, Bishop Douglas's <span class="italic">Criterion of Miracles</span>, and Soame Jenyns's <span class="italic">A View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion</span>. His defence of the established religion in <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> and the <span class="italic">Principles</span> was based on its utility in the preservation and communication of religious knowledge. Though Paley later expressed surprise at the popularity of his writings, he thought <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> would become a standard book at the universities and for persons entering into orders, and on this score was effective in getting better terms from the bookseller for its publication.<br>

<span class="italic">Natural Theology</span> was not based on lectures, and is the most original and entertaining of Paley's works. He wrote it, he says in the book's dedication, &#145;to make up my works into system&#146;. Between 1802 and his death in 1805 it passed through nine editions. The centrepiece of the work is the argument from design, introduced in the famous opening pages. From the existence of a watch and observance of its mechanism we infer the existence of a watchmaker; so, from the existence of the world and its constituent elements we infer the existence of an intelligent creator. The conformity of empirical evidence to this central analogy between the watchmaker and the divine creator constituted a compelling probability argument. However, Paley thought it amounted to more than this and claimed invincibility for his proof, based on the intuitive certainty that any contrivance, natural or artificial, must be the product of an intelligent author. He dismissed evolutionary theory as a conjecture lacking empirical evidence, a weakness in the evolutionist position which persisted down to Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>. In writing the book Paley received assistance from John Law and from Law's friend John Brinkley, the Andrews professor of astronomy at Trinity College, Dublin. He also drew substantial hints from many other authors, as his manuscripts make clear, including Boyle, Gregory, Cheselden, Derham, Ray, Monro, Adams, Wilkes, Tucker, Sturm, Goldsmith, Lesser, Smellie, Seed, Hervey, Addison, Keill, Watson, St Pierre, Cappe, Priestley, Maclaurin, and the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Natural History</span> produced by the Acad&eacute;mie Royale, Paris. Paley also seems to have borrowed from Cleanthes' side of the debate in Hume's <span class="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</span>, while the essentials of the watch analogy were a commonplace of the day and can be found in Locke, Nieuwentyt, Rousseau, and Tucker, among others. Another vital ingredient, however, was the material Paley compiled from his own investigations of nature, bringing home stones and plants from his walks and analysing the bone structures of the hare, fish, or fowl he consumed at table. The principal arguments of <span class="italic">Natural Theology</span> were countered by Bentham and George Grote in <span class="italic">An Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind</span> (1822), which resurrected the chief elements of Hume's scepticism stated in the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span>.<br>
<br>Paley's theological publications placed him at the forefront of Anglican apologetics during this period and guaranteed his writings a place in the Cambridge curriculum for several generations. However, his religious commitments were not confined to the study and the lecture hall. Though a noted pluralist, he was assiduous and devout in the performance of clerical duties. Toward the end of his life he took up a study of clerical residence and he drew up proposals to tax non-residence in order to augment small livings for &#145;An act for the better promoting the residence of the parochial clergy&#146;. When at Cambridge, Paley recommended that his pupils compose one sermon and steal five. However, he always took great pleasure in the composition of sermons and, even when he was no longer able to preach, continued to jot down hints for use in sermons. His sermons were popular, written in a style that was plain and unrhetorical and modelled on Sherlock, Clarke, and Hoadley. He never completed the project to publish a volume of his sermons. Knowing he was near to death in May 1805 he put his sermons in order, left directions for their publication in a codicil to his will, and expressed himself satisfied &#145;that now he had left that ready&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.371). An edition of five hundred copies was to be produced, but not for sale; in the &#145;Advertisement&#146; to the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> Paley indicated they were to be &#145;distributed in the neighbourhood, first to those who frequented church, then to farmers' families in the country, then to such as had a person in the family who could read, and were likely to read them&#146;. The task of editing was assigned to his curate, George Stephenson. The sermons, many of which covered themes familiar from his books, appeared in 1806 and went through seven editions by 1825. Another expanded volume was published in 1817, and Edmund Paley edited a two-volume collection in 1825. Certain omissions in the sermons raised doubts about Paley's trinitarian orthodoxy, a charge supported by the circumstantial evidence of his association with Edmund Law and others inclined to Socinianism. However Meadley, himself a convert to Unitarianism, was unconvinced. He found in Paley's works (including the sermons) sufficient evidence that he believed in &#145;the common notions, about the pre-existence, the propitiation, the present agency, and the intercession of Christ&#146;  (Meadley, 165).<h2>
<a name="Paleyspolitics"></a>Paley's politics</h2>Paley never considered himself a party man. Though he enjoyed the daily paper, <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, and frequently commented on passing political events, in his writings he attempted to strike a balance between opinions on particular subjects. Above all a man of common sense, he had an instinctive distrust of the innovative and untested. Edmund Paley thought his father would have looked with amusement on those who sought to find political bias in his writings. He was not &#145;a secret advocate for ecclesiastical reform, or a political dabbler&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.72), but rather an &#145;advocate of liberal principles&#146; who never went &#145;beyond the bounds of fair and candid conclusions, or of established order&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.71).<br>
<br>Paley's liberal principles are evident in his opposition to the slave trade and his discussions of subscription. He also took a keen interest in prison reform and, in 1801, the plight of the Irish Catholics. In 1789 his views opposing compensation for slave traders were discussed in the newspapers of the day, and in 1792 he aired his criticisms of the &#145;diabolical traffic&#146; at a public meeting in Carlisle convened to petition parliament and at which he occupied the chair. In general, however, Paley adopted a cautious attitude towards established institutions. Worried by events in France and by the popularity of Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span>, he published two tracts in defence of England's political institutions in 1792. The first, <span class="italic">Archdeacon Paley's &#145;Essay upon the British Constitution&#146;</span>, was a reprint of chapter 7 of book 6 of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> in which he extolled the virtues of the existing political arrangements. The second, originally a sermon given in Dalston in 1790, was <span class="italic">Reasons for Contentment, Addressed to the Labouring Part of the British Public</span>, in which he disingenuously argued that the labouring man should look on his lot as a happier one than that of the wealthy and pointed out the risks to every man of violent disturbance. This pamphlet elicited a good number of responses from the ranks of the radical reformers, and its arguments were contemptuously dismissed by the then radical Coleridge as &#145;Themes to debauch Boy's minds on the miseries of rich men &amp; comforts of poverty&#146;  (S. T. Coleridge, <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, ed. K. Coburn, 1957, 1.75). Even moderate reformers, such as Samuel Parr, who respected Paley for his stand on the slave trade, were horrified by his apparent reversal, but Paley did not see anything inconsistent in it. Similar criticisms of Paley were later voiced by William Hazlitt and John Austin.<br>
<br>A good number of Paley's manuscripts and notebooks survive, although often written &#145;in one of the worst and most illegible hands that ever adorned genius, mixed up in a confused and unconnected heap with penmanship of a fair and seemly quality&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.133). It was his habit suddenly to snatch a pen and scribble down his ideas as and when they occurred to him, and in later life he used an impenetrable sort of shorthand. When reviewing his notes he was often heard to exclaim: &#145;What could I have been thinking or speaking about!&#146;  (ibid., 1.135).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>The general caution and orthodoxy of Paley's principal works were counterbalanced by the easiness of his conversation, the tendency of which was to undermine subordination and question the appropriateness of existing rules and practices. On the basis of his conversation Isaac Milner, the evangelical president of Queens' College, found him &#145;as loose in politics as he is in religion&#146;  (M. Milner, <span class="italic">Life of Isaac Milner</span>, 1842, 83). Paley was by no means lacking in courtesy or a proper deference to superiors, and his blunt manner of expression rarely rankled with his friends. In the company of young men engaged in a philosophical discussion of the <i>summum bonum</i>, he once remarked: &#145;I differ from you all; the true <i>summum bonum</i> of human life consists in reading <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>; or in blowing with a pair of bellows into your shoes in hot weather, and in roasting potatoes in the ashes under the grate in the cold&#146;  (Meadley, 18&#150;19). Thrifty, humorous, and down to earth, in old age he shocked an intellectual visitor, Henry Digby Best, by complaining about the discomfort of a small rush-seated chair: &#145;I hate these nasty little chairs, they sink in the middle and <i>throost one's goots</i> up into one's <i>brains</i>&#146;  (Best, 182). When Best first met Paley in the 1790s he found him &#145;a thick, short, square-built man&#146; with &#145;bushy brows, a snub nose, and projecting teeth&#146;, in short &#145;ugly&#146;  (Best, 162&#150;4). Other contemporaries remembered him as a man of considerable integrity and generosity. His buoyant optimism remained with him to the end. It is said that he was never grave but upon grave occasions, and it was one of his apophthegms that &#145;a man who is not sometimes a fool, is always one&#146;  (Lynan, 1.49). His son Edmund remembered him with great affection as a cheerful and witty man, who was fond of field sports, though it seems his dedication to angling was an excuse for quiet contemplation.<br>
<br>For long Paley suffered from an intestinal complaint which he nicknamed &#145;the scorpion&#146;. In later life he paid regular visits to the spas of Bath, Harrogate, and Buxton, and to Harwich for the balm of its sea water. In December 1800 the illness was exacerbated by what was probably a kidney stone, described by Meadley as &#145;a violent nephralgic complaint accompanied with a species of melaena&#146;  (Meadley, 197). A recurrence in the winter of 1801&#150;2 curtailed his public appearances. Paley's physician, John Clark of Newcastle, spoke highly of his courage while he dedicated himself to the completion of <span class="italic">Natural Theology</span>. During these years Paley still amused himself with reading. In particular, he admired Malthus's <span class="italic">Essay on Population</span>, certain arguments of which had much in common with the sections of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> devoted to economic issues. Never a brilliant classicist, he continued his lifelong engagement with the works of Horace, Virgil, and Cicero. There was some talk of a bishopric and rumours that George III had vetoed William Pitt's recommendation that Paley should be made bishop of Gloucester&#151;purportedly stating: &#145;I can have no notion of the man who, in the direction of his conduct, would look for what is expedient, if he knows what is right&#146;  (&#145;Account of the life&#146;, 1.340). His son thought there was little truth in the rumour, and quoted a letter from a friend stating that the king had enjoyed reading Paley's <span class="italic">Principles</span>.<br>
<br>Shortly after visiting his residence in Lincoln in the spring of 1805 Paley suffered from painful complications arising from his illness and died at Bishopwearmouth on 25 May. On 4 June he was buried in the north aisle of Carlisle Cathedral, beside his first wife.<h2>
<a name="Influence"></a>Influence</h2>In the last twenty years of his life Paley became an intellectual colossus at Cambridge, and he long remained a significant influence through the use of his works by generations of university students. Keynes, who thought the <span class="italic">Principles</span> &#145;an immortal book&#146;  (Keynes, 108), placed Paley high among the intellectual influences shaping Malthus's political economy and pointed out that his influence at Cambridge for a generation or more was second only to Newton's. From 1787 into the early nineteenth century the <span class="italic">Principles</span> was mandatory for Cambridge examinations, and from 1822 to 1920 the <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> was on the required list for the Previous, or Little-go, examination for all second-year undergraduates. By 1814 twenty English editions of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> had appeared and by 1821 ten editions were published in the United States, where it is said to have been the most popular text on moral philosophy from the 1790s to the civil war. There were also French, Spanish, and German editions. The text remained on the Cambridge syllabus until 1920, providing an education in ethics and political economy for many generations of university graduates and leading to many abridgements and analyses. Darwin, who entered Christ's College in 1828, wrote of the <span class="italic">Evidences of Christianity</span> and <span class="italic">Natural Theology</span>: &#145;The careful study of these works &hellip; was the only part of the Academical Course which &hellip; was of the least use to me in the education of my mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Autobiography of Charles Darwin</span>, ed. N. Barlow, 1958, 59). In the second half of the century Paley's influence waned, falling victim to Darwin's evolutionary theory, which served to destroy the idea of nature as the product of design and with it the essential theological basis of his whole system.<br>
<br>Early critics of Paley's utilitarian theory included Thomas Gisborne, Richard Whately, Dugald Stewart, Edward Pearson, and Thomas Brown, against whom Paley was ably defended by Latham Wainewright in <span class="italic">A Vindication of Dr. Paley's Theory of Morals</span>. Whether they supported or refuted him, nineteenth-century thinkers had to take Paley's moral philosophy into account. John Austin followed Paley in adumbrating a religious form of utilitarianism and in explicating the necessity of rules in practical morality in <span class="italic">The Province of Jurisprudence Determined</span> (1832), and William Whewell gave considerable weight to Paley's moral thought in his critical <span class="italic">Lectures on Morality</span> (1852). As a mark of the popularity of the <span class="italic">Principles</span>, Brown denounced the &#145;Paleyans&#146; not the Benthamites. And when Coleridge penned his anti-utilitarian barbs it was Paley rather than Bentham who was uppermost in his mind. On the other hand, Leslie Stephen, though he recognized the clarity of expression in Paley's work, thought him &#145;a condenser and a compiler&#146; in moral philosophy who merely followed Locke, Waterland, and Law  (Stephen, 2.121, 131).<br>
<br>Twentieth-century commentators pointed to Paley as marking a philosophical era. Norman Sykes believed that Paley's importance &#145;lay in the exactitude with which he represented the <i>zeitgeist</i>&#146; of the utilitarianism of the eighteenth-century English establishment  (N. Sykes, <span class="italic">Church and State in England in the Eighteenth Century</span>, 1962, 326). Gerald Cragg held that Paley &#145;represented the Indian summer of eighteenth-century assumptions&#146;  (G. Cragg, <span class="italic">Reason and Authority in the Eighteenth Century</span>, 1964, 215). In LeMahieu's account, the coherence of Paley's philosophy reflects &#145;an ideological consensus among British intellectuals in the eighteenth century&#146;; he &#145;distilled and crystallized the strategic ideas of his predecessors into a philosophy whose very comprehensiveness justified its modest claims to originality&#146;  (LeMahieu, <span class="italic">The Mind of William Paley</span>, 152).<br>
