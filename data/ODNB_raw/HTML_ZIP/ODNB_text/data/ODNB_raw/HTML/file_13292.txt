<span class="headword">Hill,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, &#145;that poore and untaught towne&#146;, where he described himself as &#145;descended of meane but honest parentage&#146; (R. Hill, <span class="italic">The Contents of Scripture</span>, 1596, sig A5<i>v</i>; TNA: PRO, PROB 11/142, fol. 87). He always remained conscious of his Derbyshire roots, and in later life dubbed a portion of his London rectory his &#145;Derbyshire room&#146;  (E. Freshfield, ed., <span class="italic">The Vestry Minute Book of St Bartholomew Exchange</span>, 1890, 79). He matriculated pensioner from Christ's College, Cambridge, in July 1581, graduated BA in 1585 and proceeded MA in 1588. In 1589 he was admitted a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. Hill's subsequent activities in Cambridge reveal puritan sympathies probably acquired under the early influence of William Perkins. At St John's, Hill was among a cohort of godly young men granted fellowships in the early 1590s who later became notable puritan figures, such as William Crashawe and Abdias Ashton. While at St John's he signed petitions (organized by Henry Alvey) in favour of the imprisoned separatist Francis Johnson, and another in 1595 against the Arminian William Barrett. A disputed election for the mastership of the college in 1595 found Hill among those writing to Lord Burghley in support of candidates who included Alvey and complaining that they had been maligned as &#145;puritani&#146;  (Baker, 2.607). It is noteworthy that Hill's will mentions a &#145;Mr Henry Alvey of Cambridge&#146; as his father-in-law, although no record has been found of this marriage. Hill was again involved in controversy about 1595&#150;6, when he was the chief complainant to Bishop Richard Bancroft of London against a sermon given by the regius professor John Overall in his capacity as vicar of Epping, especially concerning the question of whether Christ had died for all men.<br>
<br>Hill's career progressed uncertainly during these years, although the feoffees of St Andrew, Norwich, appointed him as curate, a position he held from about 1591 to 1602. Nevertheless, he seems to have been based in Cambridge for much of this time and in 1596 was apparently living at Park Hall, Essex, at the house of Sir William FitzWilliam. In the dedication to his <span class="italic">Life-everlasting</span> (1601) Hill signed himself as &#145;your Lordships most bounden and dutifull Chaplaine&#146;, although the &#145;Preface to the reader&#146; is dated from St John's College where Hill continued as a fellow until 1608&#150;9. Hill had proceeded BD in 1595 and it was during the 1590s that he first established himself as a dedicated religious popularizer and pedagogue and a translator of continental protestant divines. In 1591 he translated William Perkins's classic, <span class="italic">A Golden Chaine</span>, into English, at the author's specific request. Hill later produced a version of the same text set out in a catechetical form, published in 1612. In 1596 he published <span class="italic">The Contents of Scripture</span>&#151;effectively an abridgement and explication of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#151;&#145;wherby the yong beginner might get entrance into reading, &amp; the old reader be readied in remembring&#146;  (sig. A7), which also contained passages from Isaac Tremelius, Francis Junius, Theodore Beza, Johannes Piscator, and John Calvin. A more scholarly work was <span class="italic">Life-everlasting, or, The true knowledge of one Jehovah, three Elohim, and Jesus Immanuel: collected out of the best modern divines</span> (1601), in which Hill espoused a hard-line position on predestination and insisted emphatically on the need for the doctrine to be fully taught to a lay audience, an insistence also reflected in his clash with Overall.<br>
<br>In 1602 Hill moved to the capital when he obtained a lectureship at the fashionable parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, a position he retained until 1613. It was for this parish that he composed his most popular work, a catechism which went through eight editions and was posthumously translated into Dutch. Originally published in 1606 as <span class="italic">Christs Prayer Expounded, a Christian Directed, and a Communicant Prepared</span>, it was greatly expanded in 1609 as <span class="italic">The Pathway to Prayer and Pietie</span>. These later editions included new material such as &#145;A direction to Christian life&#146; and &#145;An instruction to die well&#146;. This catechism displays Hill's pastoral abilities to best advantage, and it is distinguished by its clarity of exposition, use of homely similes, and willingness to tackle difficult pastoral issues.<br>
<br>Although Hill obtained a living at St Margaret Moses in 1607, he continued to live in St Martin's parish, sometimes in the houses of its vestrymen, apparently lacking the means to provide himself with accommodation. During this period Hill proceeded DD, in 1609. Finally, in 1613, the support of Lord Chancellor Ellesmere gained him preferment to the prosperous City living of St Bartholomew by the Exchange, where he remained until his death in 1623. On 1 June 1614, at Canterbury Cathedral, Hill married Marguerite or Margaret, widow of the prebendary Adrian Saravia. She was the well-born daughter of John de Wijts, a religious refugee from Antwerp. Margaret Hill died in childbirth on 29 June 1615, aged thirty-nine, and her death was lamented in print by Hill and Joshua Sylvester in the sixth edition of <span class="italic">The Pathway to Prayer</span> (1615&#150;16), in which it was noted that she had served in the households of the Hastings and Palavicinio families.<br>
<br>Hill seems always to have been a conforming puritan, and he lamented the 1607 death of Bishop Richard Vaughan of London, whom he characterized as &#145;an ornament to our Church in which he was a preaching Bishop&#146; and &#145;a most watchfull and temperate Governour&#146;  (Hill, 1609 edn, foreword). Nevertheless, Hill's sympathy for more radical religious figures remained with him to the end. In 1620, for example, he edited the works of the nonconformist Samuel Hieron, prefacing the volume with a laudatory account which is a principal source for Hieron's life. Throughout his life Hill clearly felt dogged by the insecurity of his financial position. His will orders the sale of his library and he entreats his St Bartholomew's parishioners &#145;that since I was a principall meanes to builde the parsonage house they would mediate that my loving wife may not uppon a soddaine be put out of yt but have convenient tyme to provide for her selfe&#146;. Hill also left bequests to Dr Richard Clarke &#145;of Canterbury&#146;, Thomas Westfield (future bishop of Bristol, whose sister, Susan, had married Hill some time after 1615) and the Vintners' Company, of which he was a member. He died in August 1623 and was buried in the chancel of St Bartholomew by the Exchange, survived by his wife.<br>
