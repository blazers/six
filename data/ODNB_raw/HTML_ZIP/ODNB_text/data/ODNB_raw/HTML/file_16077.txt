<span class="headword">Larpent,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1824), <span class="occ">examiner of plays</span>, was born on 14 November 1741, the second son of John Larpent (1710&#150;1797), later chief clerk to the Foreign Office, and his wife, Mary Ann, the daughter of James Pazant, of a refugee Norman family. Larpent was educated at Westminster School and entered the Foreign Office. He was secretary to John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, at the treaty of Paris in 1763 and to Francis Seymour Conway, first marquess of Hertford, when the latter was lord lieutenant of Ireland. He remained Hertford's secretary, and followed him to the lord chamberlain's department. By 1777 he had become a groom of the privy chamber. In November 1778 he was appointed examiner of plays by Hertford, to succeed William Chetwynd, who had held the post since its inception in 1738.<br>
<br>Larpent had married Frances, the daughter of Maximilian Western of Cokethorpe Park, Oxfordshire, on 12 or 14 August 1773. They had two sons before Frances died on 9 November 1777. The influence of Larpent's second wife, Anna Margaretta Porter (1758&#150;1832) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65588/', "Larpent, Anna Margaretta")</script>], helped shape his role as examiner. She was a sharply observant diarist and enthusiastic follower of the theatre, whom Larpent married on 25 April 1782, and who was soon acting as his deputy.<br>
<br>Larpent's policy as examiner reflected the times. Before 1789 he was tolerant of generalized political satire, but in the heightened climate of the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars he became more sensitive, ordering revisions even to pro-government plays should they inadvertently encourage sedition. However, he was conscientious and a polite and sensitive negotiator, on several occasions successfully working with playwrights and managers to render rejected plays suitable for performance. Episodes such as Theodore Hook's attack on Larpent, which followed the suppression of his play <span class="italic">Killing No Murder</span> in 1819 on the grounds that it was excessively insulting to Methodists, were the exception rather than the rule. Larpent considered Hook's subsequent claim that he was a Methodist libellous.<br>
<br>Larpent died at his home in East Sheen, Surrey, on 18 January 1824. He was survived by Anna Larpent, by the elder son of his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16075/', "Francis Seymour Larpent")</script>, and by the sons of his second (there seem to have been no daughters), John James Larpent (1783&#150;1860) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16076/', "George Gerard Larpent")</script>. He also left behind him the collection of plays built by successive examiners since the licensing act of 1737, which he and his wife had carefully maintained. The collection was not passed on to his successor, George Colman the younger, and ownership was assumed by Anna Larpent, who sold the plays to John Payne Collier and Thomas Amyot. It was acquired in 1853 by Francis Egerton, first earl of Ellesmere, and in 1917 by Henry E. Huntington, and thence passed to the Huntington Library, California.<br>
