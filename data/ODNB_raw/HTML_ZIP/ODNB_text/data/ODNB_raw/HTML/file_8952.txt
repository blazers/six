<span class="headword">Evan <span class="st"> [Evans]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1716&#150;1798), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and poet</span>, was born in March 1716 in Tir Evan Rhys, a farmhouse at Llwydcoed, Aberd&acirc;r, Glamorgan, the son of Ifan ap Si&ocirc;n ap Rhys, a weaver and smallholder noted for his geniality and fondness for poetry. Reputedly a skilled harpist when he was only eleven years old, Evan's services in that capacity were later frequently in demand. The <i>englynion</i> he sang in the eisteddfod held in Cymer, Glamorgan, on 1 March 1735 show that, although he was then only eighteen years old, he was already taking an intelligent interest in Welsh prosody. He received very little education in his early, formative years, but he was later taught by James John, a hooper and farmer from Aberd&acirc;r, who was well read in both Welsh and English and a fairly good poet.<br>
<br>After working for a few years as a weaver, Evan was apprenticed, at the age of twenty-three, to carpentry and glazing under Lewis Hopkin (1707/8&#150;1771) at Hendre Ifan Goch, in the parish of Llandyfodwg, Glamorgan, and it was his close association with Hopkin which explains the main features of his career as a Welsh bard and nonconformist. Under his guidance Evan applied himself to mastering the Welsh strict metres and the contents of the bardic grammar, and he soon set about composing an &#145;exemplifying ode&#146;, that is, a composition incorporating one of each of the canonical twenty-four strict metres. It was probably Hopkin who also aroused his interest in English literature, and Evan's work contains Welsh translations of some of the poems of Pope, Samuel Butler, Bishop Horne, and Isaac Watts. It may also have been under the influence of Hopkin and the religious congregation at Cymer, Porth, that Evan became a nonconformist.<br>
<br>Edward Evan worked for many years as a carpenter and glazier&#151;in seventeen parishes in all. After his first marriage in 1744 to Margaret Thomas of Penderyn (<i>d</i>. 1774), he settled for a while at Cefnpennar Isaf, Glamorgan, but in 1749 he moved to the farm of Ton-coch, above Dyffryn House, Mountain Ash, where he remained until his death in 1798. About 1748 (or possibly a little earlier), he joined the nonconformist congregation at Cwm-y-glo, and when a separate church&#151;&#145;the Old Meeting-House&#146;&#151;was later established near Aberd&acirc;r, he became one of its most prominent members and a preacher. An orthodox Calvinist in his earlier days, according to Edward Williams 
    (Iolo Morganwg; 1747&#150;1826)
  , he later turned towards Arminianism and, later still, to Arianism. However, he did not take a prominent part in contemporary theological disputations. Some of his political views were of a distinctly radical nature. From 1 July 1772 until 1796 he was pastor of the Old Meeting-House. About 1776 he married Mary Llywelyn of Rhigos (1733&#150;1824). The second marriage produced two sons, Edward (1776?&#150;1862), and Rhys (1779&#150;1867), who was of some literary repute and an ardent supporter of eisteddfodau.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Evan published two prose works: <span class="italic">Gwersi i blant a dynjon jeuaingc, mewn dau gatecism</span> (1757), a Welsh translation of one of Samuel Bourn's catechisms; and <span class="italic">Golwg ar gynheddfau gwasanaeth, ac anrhydedd gwasanaethwyr Crist</span> (1775), a sermon delivered at one of the Presbyterian gatherings. He also published in 1767, jointly with Lewis Hopkin, a Welsh translation in the <i>cywydd</i> metre of the book of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>, a translation first begun by David Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1735), who proceeded no further than the first chapter.<br>
<br>Evan died at Ton-coch on 21 June 1798, aged eighty-two, and was buried in St John's churchyard, Aberd&acirc;r. After his death some of his poetry was published at Merthyr Tudful under the title <span class="italic">Caniadau moesol a duwiol</span> (1804). Three enlarged editions were later published under the title <span class="italic">Afalau'r awen</span>&#151;at Merthyr in 1816 and 1837, and at Aberd&acirc;r in 1874. His verse, which shows that he remained a jovial character to the end of his days, was very popular among the Welsh inhabitants of upper Glamorgan. He became a somewhat romantic figure after it was claimed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in November 1789 that he and Iolo Morganwg were by then the only surviving legitimate descendants of the &#145;<i>Ancient British Bards</i>&#146;.<br>
