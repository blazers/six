<span class="headword">Parrinder,  (Edward) Geoffrey Simons</span>  (1910&#150;2005), <span class="occ">Methodist minister and scholar of comparative religion</span>, was born into a Methodist family on 30 April 1910 at Walpole, Hadley Road, New Barnet, Hertfordshire, the second of three sons of William Patrick Parrinder (1877&#150;1944), warehouseman and commercial traveller, and his wife, Florence Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bellamy (1880&#150;1976). His father worked for glove firms in the City of London, eventually setting up his own business. Parrinder went to school in Leigh-on-Sea where his family had moved in 1919, before leaving at sixteen to work as a booking clerk at the local railway station. While working as a railway clerk he qualified as a local preacher and then trained for the Wesleyan Methodist ministry at Richmond College, London (1929&#150;32).<br>
<br>Responding to a call from the Methodist Mission House to serve in French west Africa, Parrinder left for Dahomey in 1933, after studying some theology and French in Montpellier. From that time he worked on and off in Africa for nineteen years. In 1936 he returned to England to be ordained. On 25 July 1936, at the Wesley Central Hall in Hendon, he married Esther Mary Burt (1909&#150;2007), a nurse whom he had met some years earlier at a Methodist meeting. She was the daughter of Frank Burt, farmer. Mary and Geoffrey Parrinder were deeply devoted to each other throughout sixty-nine years of married life. They had one daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>When on leave in England in 1940 the Parrinders could not return to Dahomey because it was under Vichy collaborationist rule. Parrinder then worked in the Methodist circuit in Redruth, Cornwall (1940&#150;43) and in the French circuit in Guernsey (1946&#150;9), with another spell in west Africa in between. During this time he first took external London BA and BD degrees, then worked for the degrees of MA, MTh, and PhD, using empirical research into the indigenous religious beliefs of west Africa. This prefigured his subsequent career as a pioneering scholar and teacher of comparative religious studies. His first book, <span class="italic">West African Religion</span> (1949), was soon followed by more research on religion in Ibadan, published as <span class="italic">Religion in an African City</span> (1953), which gained him the London University degree of DD. Other important publications were <span class="italic">African Psychology</span> (1951), <span class="italic">African Traditional Religion</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">Witchcraft</span> (1958).<br>
<br>In 1949 Parrinder was appointed to the highly innovative department of religious studies at University College, Ibadan, Nigeria, first as a lecturer (1949&#150;50) and then as senior lecturer (1950&#150;58), influencing many African students, including the Nigerian novelist and poet Chinua Achebe, and making lasting friendships. On a six-month sabbatical and a grant from the Carnegie Trust in 1956 he travelled to east and south Africa, India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon. The resulting book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to Asian Religions</span> (1957), helped him to obtain in 1958 the new post of reader in the comparative study of religions at King's College, London. Awarded a personal chair in 1970, he became dean of the faculty of theology (1972&#150;4), and retired in 1977.<br>
<br>Parrinder was a founding member of the British Association for the Study of Religions, its honorary secretary (1960&#150;72) and president (1972&#150;7), and later a life member. He was active in the London Society for the Study of Religion, of which he was president (1980&#150;82), and in the London Society of Jews and Christians, which elected him president (1981&#150;90) and then honorary life president (1990). Other important activities included participating in the World Congress of Faiths and the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education, of which he was a founding member in 1969 and co-president until 1987. He served on the editorial boards of several journals and gave many prestigious lectures, among others the Charles Strong lectures in Sydney (1964), the Wilde lectures in natural and comparative religion at Oxford (1966&#150;9), and the Westcott Teape lectures in India (1973). He was also a visiting professor at the International Christian University in Tokyo (1977&#150;8) and a visiting lecturer at the University of Surrey (1978&#150;82). He was made a fellow of King's College, London, in 1972 and an honorary DLitt of Lancaster University in 1975.<br>
<br>Parrinder's publishing output was phenomenal, including thirty-four single-author and seven edited books, one jointly written book, and two anthologies between 1949 and 2000, as well as numerous shorter and revised works, published under new titles. His pioneering work on African religions probably ranked highest among his academic achievements, but his wide influence was largely due to his works on Indian religions, Islam, and comparative themes that appealed to a large public. The widely used textbook <span class="italic">What World Religions Teach</span> (1963) was a best-seller, and his first work, <span class="italic">West African Religion</span>, remained in print for forty years. Among his well-known comparative works were <span class="italic">Worship in the World's Religions</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Avatar and Incarnation</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Mysticism in the World's Religions</span> (1976), and <span class="italic">Sex in the World's Religions</span> (1980), republished as <span class="italic">Sexual Morality in the World's Religions</span> (1995). Parrinder went on writing until January 2003, producing after forty-five years his last report, &#145;Religion&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Annual Register of World Events</span>.<br>
<br>Through his numerous writings, lectures, radio and television talks, and his work with educational bodies and academic associations, Parrinder exercised a wide influence on the study of world religions in schools and universities in Britain and abroad. A towering academic figure with an impressive career, he always remained humble and kind, even a little shy, and never boasted about his academic achievements. A tall, gaunt figure with a mass of hair and erect bearing, he always had a welcoming gesture towards guest and stranger. Family and friends knew him as a spirited, witty raconteur with a great love for stimulating conversation, whether pursuing an intellectual or political argument, or just small talk about the latest academic affairs. He was a man of great compassion, kindness, and a large heart who flourished as a human being and made others flourish around him. He ceaselessly worked for closer collaboration between members of different faiths and cultures, and for the advancement of the study of religions as a significant subject area in all educational institutions, from schools to universities. Former students, colleagues, and friends published a Festschrift for his eightieth birthday (with a bibliography of his works), <span class="italic">Turning Points in Religious Studies</span> (1990), for which Archbishop Desmond Tutu, once his student, wrote the foreword.<br>
<br>Parrinder died of heart failure on 16 June 2005 at 31 Charterhouse Road, Orpington, Kent, where he had lived since his return from Africa. He was survived by his wife, daughter, and one son, one son having predeceased him. During a service of thanksgiving at Orpington Methodist church, where he and his wife had worshipped for more than forty years, he was fondly remembered as a distinguished scholar, a close friend, and a happy family man.<br>
