<span class="headword">Mary</span> <span class="st"> [Mary of Guise]</span>  (1515&#150;1560), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of James V, and regent of Scotland</span>, was the eldest of the twelve children of Claude, first duc de Guise (1496&#150;1550), and his wife, Antoinette de Bourbon (1493&#150;1583), daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois, third comte de Vend&ocirc;me (1470&#150;1495).<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandfirstmarriage"></a>Childhood and first marriage</h2>Born on 20 November 1515 in the castle of Bar-le-Duc, she was baptized there twelve days later. When she was four her father's mother, Philippa of Gueldres, entered the convent of Poor Clares at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson and Mary's parents went to live in her former residence, the family's ancestral castle of Joinville. Some years later Mary was sent to her grandmother to be educated in the convent, perhaps with the intention that she should become a nun, but when she was about fourteen her uncle Antoine, duc de Lorraine, and his wife visited her and decided that it would be a waste to keep a handsome, eligible girl like Mary shut away from the world. Exceptionally tall, like the rest of her father's family, she had auburn hair, grey eyes, and a charming manner. Her uncle took her back to Nancy, and then to the French court to witness the coronation of Fran&ccedil;ois I's new wife, Eleanor of Austria. Mary was presented to the king and queen, rode in the royal procession when Eleanor made her formal entry into Paris, and attended the royal banquet afterwards. She was soon a great favourite, the king treating her almost as if she were his own daughter.<br>
<br>Among those who had played a leading part in the queen's coronation was Louis, duc de Longueville (1510&#150;1537), grand chamberlain of France. His lands lay in Normandy, to the north of the Guise possessions, and in 1534 he and Mary were betrothed. Louis settled on her the castle and lands of Ch&acirc;teaudun, while she brought with her a dowry of 80,000 livres, augmented by 40,000 livres from Fran&ccedil;ois I. They were married on 4 August 1534 in the Louvre, before the entire court, the celebratory banquets and tournaments lasting for sixteen days afterwards.<br>
<br>Mary and her husband were happy together and their first son, born in their castle at Amiens on 30 October 1535, was christened Fran&ccedil;ois after the king. They travelled round their estates in the summer months, but much of their time was spent at court and on 1 January 1537 they attended the wedding of Madeleine, the elder daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois I, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V, king of Scots (1512&#150;1542)")</script>. By then Mary was pregnant again, but on 9 June 1537 her husband died of a fever in Rouen, leaving her a widow at twenty-one. Her second son was born at Ch&acirc;teaudun on 4 August 1537 and named Louis after his father.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriage"></a>Second marriage</h2>Mary's intention was to live quietly at Ch&acirc;teaudun, running the Longueville estates for her elder son, but two months after her husband's death she was dismayed to receive a letter from Fran&ccedil;ois I informing her that she was to marry the widowed king of Scots. Queen Madeleine, always delicate, had died on 7 July 1537, and James V now wanted another French bride. Soon afterwards Henry VIII of England announced that he too was a suitor for Mary. His third wife, Jane Seymour, had just died and he wanted to prevent his nephew James V from strengthening Scotland's traditional alliance with France by taking James's intended wife for himself. When the French ambassador asked Henry why he was so set on marrying the duc de Guise's daughter, the English king replied that Mary was big in person and he needed a big wife. &#145;I may be big in person&#146;, she commented dryly when she heard this, &#145;but my neck is small&#146;  (Fraser, 7).<br>
<br>In December 1537 Mary's infant son Louis died and in the midst of her grief she received a letter from Fran&ccedil;ois I ordering her to proceed with the Scottish marriage. Bowing to the inevitable she sent a representative to court, and was horrified to learn that the king had decided that although he himself would supply 30,000 livres of her dowry of 150,000 livres, the rest was to come not from her father but from the lands and revenues settled on her by her first husband. This would be very prejudicial to the interests of her surviving son, for it meant that part of his inheritance was in effect being transferred to the king of Scots. Mary urged her friend Marguerite de Navarre, sister of Fran&ccedil;ois I, to speak to the king, and Marguerite must have done so to some effect, for when the contract was signed in Lyons at the end of March 1538, the offending clause had been removed. Fran&ccedil;ois I would provide no less than 70,000 livres and Mary's father would contribute the remaining 80,000 livres. If James V died first, his heirs would return to Mary one third of the dowry if there were children of the marriage, one half if there were none. As her jointure she would receive Falkland Palace and the castles of Stirling, Dingwall, and Threave, the earldoms of Strathearn, Ross, Orkney, and Fife, and the lordships of Galloway, Ardmannach, and the Isles. Were she to be widowed, she would be free to return to France if she wished, and she would continue to draw the revenues from her jointure lands.<br>
<br>Mary's grandmother Philippa of Gueldres had been the niece of James's great-grandmother Mary of Gueldres, the wife of James II, and so James wrote to the pope for the necessary dispensation of consanguinity. He decided not to return to France to collect his new bride in person, but instead sent Robert, fifth Lord Maxwell, to France as his proxy. Mary's second wedding took place on 9 May 1538 in the castle of Ch&acirc;teaudun, Maxwell placing upon her finger a diamond spousing ring which had cost James considerably less than the ring with which he had married Madeleine. Mary could not take her small son with her to Scotland, for his inheritance lay in France, and so she left him with her mother, who was expecting her twelfth child. The little duke would be happy in the nurseries at Joinville with Mary's young brothers and sisters, some of whom were about his own age. Several weeks after the proxy wedding Mary's family escorted her to Rouen. Her father, her sister Louise, and a retinue of French servants would accompany her to Scotland, and they embarked at Le Havre on 10 June aboard the same three galleys which had carried James V and Madeleine north the previous year.<br>
<br>On Trinity Sunday (16 June) 1538 Mary of Guise set foot in her new country for the first time, landing at Balcomie in Fife. She spent the night in Balcomie Castle, and in the morning her new husband arrived with a procession of courtiers to escort her to St Andrews. There she was greeted with a pageant specially composed by Sir David Lindsay, the lord Lyon (the Scottish king of arms), and next morning the royal marriage was solemnly confirmed and blessed at a service in the cathedral. Even the sophisticated French were impressed by &#145;the magnificent novelties&#146; with which the guests were subsequently entertained  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Mary of Guise</span>, 60). The celebrations lasted for forty days and included archery contests, hunting, hawking, and a series of tournaments in which the duc de Guise played a prominent part. He and the other French courtiers remained in Scotland until August, when James took his queen on a tour of her various jointure lands. She finally made her formal entry into Edinburgh on St Margaret's day, 16 November 1538.<h2>
<a name="QueenofScots"></a>Queen of Scots</h2>Despite homesickness, Mary expressed tactful pleasure at all she saw, while the Scots for their part were delighted with this impressive, well-made mother of sons, so different from fragile Madeleine. James treated Mary kindly and soon she was thinking of ways of improving her surroundings, sending to her mother for French masons to work at Falkland Palace and Stirling Castle, begging a French friend for cuttings from fruit trees, and trying to obtain young wild boars for the forests of Falkland. She also urged her mother to dispatch experienced miners from Lorraine to exploit the valuable minerals of Crawfordmuir, high up in the hills of western Scotland.<br>
<br>As the months went by, however, there was a good deal of concern that Mary of Guise showed no sign of pregnancy, and it was noticeable that she had not yet been crowned queen of Scots. She would have to produce a son to secure her position. In August 1539 she and James V made a pilgrimage to St Adrian's shrine on the Isle of May, a well-known source of help for barren women, and not long afterwards she found that she was pregnant. She was crowned in Holyrood Abbey on 22 February 1540, and on 22 May her child was born at St Andrews, a son, who was baptized James when he was a week old. On 24 April in the following year another son, Robert, was born to her in Stirling Castle.<br>
<br>A week after that alarming news arrived from Fife. Prince James was seriously ill. The king rode at once for St Andrews, but by the time he got there his elder son was already dead. Even as he left the chamber where the baby lay, an anxious messenger arrived from Stirling to tell him that Prince Robert had also fallen ill. The infant was still alive when his father reached the castle, but he died a few hours later. The little princes were buried together in Holyrood Abbey, and James's mother observed that the king and queen were said to be in great distress. Clad in deepest mourning they made a progress through Perth and Aberdeen that summer, returning to Edinburgh by way of Falkland. Early the following year Mary was pregnant once more.<h2>
<a name="Thedeathoftheking"></a>The death of the king</h2>Relations between Scotland and England were now deteriorating rapidly. James V had ignored Henry VIII's urgings to follow his example and break with the Roman Catholic church and Henry decided that he could no longer tolerate the threat from his northern neighbour. In spring 1542 he not only instructed his archbishop of Canterbury to search through the ancient records for any document which would prove his claim to be overlord of Scotland, but he also considered the cheaper and quicker expedient of having his agents kidnap James.<br>
<br>The archbishop's search failed to yield anything and Henry decided to invade Scotland. Mary of Guise walked 7 miles to Our Lady of Loretto, just outside Edinburgh, to pray for the safety of her husband and his kingdom, but on 24 November 1542 the Scots were defeated at the battle of Solway Moss. James was not present at the battle but the defeat plunged him into despair. Riding first to Tantallon Castle, where he kept a mistress, he made his way to Linlithgow to see Mary and then travelled on to Falkland, &#145;his mind near gone through dolour and care&#146;  (Lesley, 2.258&#150;9). On 8 December 1542 the queen gave birth to her first daughter. James was lying ill in bed when they told him, and it was then that he made his famous remark, &#145;It cam' wi' a lass and it will gang wi' a lass&#146;, meaning that although his family had gained the throne through a woman, Robert I's daughter Marjorie, a male heir was now vital in such troubled times. He died on 14 December, just before midnight, leaving Mary of Guise a widow for the second time, at the age of twenty-seven. Hitherto clad in gorgeous purple, crimson, and tawny silks encrusted with gold passementerie, she now put on the mourning black which she would wear for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>Although her marriage contract entitled Mary to return to France, she decided to stay in Scotland to protect the interests of her baby daughter, known to posterity as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18248/', "Mary, queen of Scots")</script>. Traditionally, a widowed Scottish queen could expect to act as regent for her child, but Mary of Guise was lying in childbed at Linlithgow while Cardinal David Beaton, primate of Scotland, and James, second earl of Arran, head of the house of Hamilton and heir presumptive to the throne, were locked in a determined struggle for the regency. Meanwhile, the threat from England remained. Henry VIII had immediately seen the possibilities of the changed situation. He would persuade the Scots to marry their infant queen to his young son Edward, take her into his own hands, and Scotland would be his.<h2>
<a name="Theroughwooing"></a>The rough wooing</h2>On 3 January 1543 the Scottish lords chose the earl of Arran as regent. The lord governor, as he was styled, believed that a further invasion of Scotland could only be averted by making peace with England. Mary of Guise supported Cardinal Beaton, who was known to favour the French alliance, for now, virtually Arran's prisoner in Linlithgow, she feared that he would hand her daughter over to Henry VIII. In fact she wished to be regent herself, but in the present emergency it suited her to collaborate with the cardinal, just as he hoped to profit from her influence in France. Desperate to counteract the lord governor's influence, they together decided to invite back to Scotland the earl of Lennox, Arran's great rival, then living in France. Lured on by illusory promises that Mary of Guise would consider marrying him, Lennox returned, but his rival's very presence did much to strengthen Arran's wavering resolve to pursue an English alliance. The treaties of Greenwich were concluded on 1 July 1543. There would be peace between Scotland and England and Mary, queen of Scots, would be married to Henry VIII's son Edward. Mary of Guise's opposition to the match was well known, and when a French fleet was sighted off the east coast there were immediate rumours that the ships had come to take her and her daughter to France. Arran at once set about fortifying Linlithgow Palace, but Lennox and Beaton marched against him and he was forced to agree that Mary could move her daughter to Stirling Castle.<br>
<br>The treaties of Greenwich had not yet been ratified, and while Mary did her best to influence the Scottish lords against them, Beaton persuaded Arran to abandon the English alliance. On 8 September 1543 the lord governor did public penance for his recent support of the protestants, promising to take no action without the advice and consent of the cardinal. The following day Mary, queen of Scots, was crowned in the Chapel Royal at Stirling. Mary of Guise now became the principal member of a new council of regency and in December the Scottish parliament solemnly declared the treaties of Greenwich to be null and renewed their ancient alliance with France. Vowing vengeance, Henry VIII sent a fleet to the River Forth in May 1544 and the first of the series of devastating invasions later known as the &#145;rough wooing&#146; began. While Mary of Guise and her daughter remained in the safety of Stirling Castle, the English burned Holyrood Abbey, where her husband and sons were buried. A general council meeting at Stirling on 29 May blamed Arran for his failure to drive back the English and ordered him to resign the regency in favour of Mary of Guise and a council of twelve advisers, but the lord governor clung to power and Mary was not powerful enough to dislodge him.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1545 Arran won a resounding victory over the English at Ancrum Moor and that April the Scots rejected English requests that negotiations be reopened on the basis of the treaties of Greenwich. In response to Mary of Guise's pleas for help, the French sent assistance in the form of a force led by Jacques de Montgomery, seigneur de Lorges, but that autumn Henry VIII's forces were back, burning the abbeys of Kelso, Melrose, Dryburgh, and Jedburgh. Henry himself died on 28 January 1547, but Lord Protector Somerset, commander of the previous invasions, continued his policy towards Scotland, marched north in August, and routed Arran and the Scots at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547.<h2>
<a name="TheFrenchalliance"></a>The French alliance</h2>Sending her daughter to the secluded island of Inchmahome, on the Lake of Menteith, Mary of Guise pleaded with the French ambassador, Henri Cleutin, seigneur d'Oysel, for further help. It was not in the interests of France to see Scotland overrun by the English, and so Henri II instructed d'Oysel to persuade Mary of Guise to agree to a new scheme. Her daughter should marry the king's son, the dauphin, Fran&ccedil;ois. England would then be trapped irrevocably between France and Scotland. In return for Mary of Guise's compliance, he would send her substantial assistance.<br>
<br>Mary was relieved, even though it meant agreeing to her daughter being brought up at the French court. At least she would be safe there. The following February the English invaded yet again, and Mary sent the little queen west to Dumbarton Castle. Not until mid-June did the promised French assistance arrive, led by Andr&eacute; de Montalembert, sieur d'Ess&eacute;. Mary of Guise urged him to recapture Haddington from the English but he was reluctant, for the French wanted the new treaty to be signed before they did anything. However, when Mary personally rallied the Scots, urging them to join with the French in driving out the enemy, the siege began, and the treaty of Haddington was signed on 7 July 1548. Mary, queen of Scots, would marry the dauphin, and Henri II promised to defend Scotland as he did his own realm, while maintaining Scottish laws and liberties.<br>
<br>Touring the French and Scottish camps at Haddington two days later, Mary of Guise narrowly escaped death when English guns from the town fired on her cavalcade, killing and wounding sixteen of her gentlemen as well as other members of her household. She fainted with horror, but she was unhurt. As soon as she had heard masses for the dead, she left for Dumbarton to see her daughter embark for France. The young Queen Mary set sail on 7 August 1548 and the earl of Arran was persuaded, somewhat against his will, to make the journey to the French court too. Henri II then rewarded him for agreeing to Mary's marriage by making him duc de Ch&acirc;telherault.<br>
<br>In June 1549 yet another English fleet sailed into the River Forth, but at Mary's instigation newly arrived French reinforcements managed to seize the strategically important island of Inchkeith which the English had captured. When France and England signed a peace treaty the following April, she decided to take advantage of the opportunity to visit the French court herself. She was, of course, anxious to see her children, but there were urgent matters of public business too. She wanted to press Henri II for financial assistance and she needed his support if she was to oust Ch&acirc;telherault from his position as lord governor.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoFrance"></a>Return to France</h2>In the middle of August 1550 Henri sent Leon Strozzi with six galleys to bring Mary of Guise from Scotland, and after a series of delays she finally embarked at Leith, arriving at Dieppe on 19 September. She was accompanied by a large number of Scottish noblemen whom she had not dared leave behind for fear of the trouble they could cause in her absence. The duc de Ch&acirc;telherault had remained at home, however, for he was too satisfied with his new title to cause any trouble, and the French ambassador d'Oysel, now lieutenant-general of Scotland, would keep a watchful eye on him.<br>
<br>Mary's father had died earlier in the year, but her brothers the duc de Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine were waiting to escort her to Paris. She made a ceremonial entry into the city with her retinue of Scottish noblemen, and was reunited with her children. Mary, queen of Scots, was seven now, and her son Fran&ccedil;ois, duc de Longueville, was fourteen. She had not seen him for twelve years. When he was small, her mother had sent her pictures of him and even a length of cord to show his height, but in more recent times he had been able to write to her himself, telling her that he longed to come to Scotland to fight in her cause. After a delighted reunion Mary lost no time in engaging the French king and his advisers in serious discussions about the future of Scotland. Some of the French said that since Mary, queen of Scots, would so soon be the bride of the dauphin, a Frenchman should be appointed to govern Scotland in her name, but Mary insisted that she herself should rule as regent. In November she went with the court to Chartres and then on to Blois, where they spent the winter. Secret discussions continued, the Scots who had come with Mary received lavish bribes, and the English ambassador complained that the queen dowager of Scotland was exercising far too much influence.<br>
<br>The discovery of a plot to poison her daughter caused Mary of Guise to cancel her plans to return to Scotland in the spring of 1551, and she remained with the French court throughout the summer, visiting Tours, Angers, and Nantes and then making a progress through Brittany. When Henri II moved to his favourite residence of Fontainebleau, he agreed that she could visit Joinville. Her old home was sadly changed, with her father dead, her mother in deepest mourning, and her brothers and sisters grown up and living elsewhere, but she stayed there until early September. When she then moved to Amiens to begin the preparations for her journey back to Scotland, another family crisis intervened. Her son had gone with her to see her off, but when they reached Amiens he fell ill and although Mary nursed him tenderly, he died in her arms. &#145;Our Lord must wish me for one of His chosen ones, since He has visited me so often with such sorrow. Praised be He by all&#146;, Mary wrote sadly to her own mother  (Pimodan, 380). After the funeral she hastened the preparations for her departure and sailed from Dieppe in mid-October.<br>
<br>Mary of Guise had decided to visit Edward VI on her way back to Scotland, and so she crossed the channel and made her way to Hampton Court, where she was welcomed by a large delegation of English courtiers. Next day she sailed along the Thames to the bishop of London's palace and then on 4 November went in procession to the palace of Westminster, where Edward VI entertained her to a banquet. The following day he sent her a gift of two horses and a ring set with a diamond. She left London on 6 November 1551, escorted for the first part of the journey by the duke of Northumberland, the earls of Pembroke and Wiltshire, and many other lords and ladies and their retinues. As she passed through each shire on the way north she was accompanied by the local dignitaries until she finally reached Berwick, where she was welcomed by various Scottish noblemen including the earl of Bothwell and Lord Hume.<br>
<br>She had come back with her status greatly enhanced by her reception in Paris and London, but even so she could not wrest the regency from Ch&acirc;telherault right away. In the summer of 1553 she welcomed the accession of Mary I to the English throne but when she heard disturbing rumours that the earl of Lennox was plotting to seize the government of Scotland for himself, she decided that the time had come to act. She sent d'Oysel to France to consult Henri II, and when he returned worked with him to persuade Ch&acirc;telherault to relinquish his position. He was predictably reluctant, but on 19 February he capitulated in return for promises of financial benefit, grants of property to various relatives, and the position of lieutenant-general, currently held by d'Oysel. Parliament met on 12 April 1554, Ch&acirc;telherault resigned his office, d'Oysel placed the crown of Scotland on Mary of Guise's head, and handed her the sceptre and the sword of state. At last she was queen regent of Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Queenregent"></a>Queen regent</h2>Mary of Guise replaced Ch&acirc;telherault's men with her own supporters, rewarded her adherents with gifts of land and money, and bribed those who were liable to waver. She also aroused much hostility by appointing Frenchmen to various public positions. Monsieur de Rubay, one of the French king's counsellors, would keep the king's seal, Bartholomew de Villemore would control the customs, Monsieur Bonet, a member of her own household, became her bailie of Orkney, and in 1557 the Frenchman Jean Roytell was appointed principal master mason. At the same time she tried to restore firm central government. She attended parliament personally in 1555 and much of its legislation dealt with the administration of justice and the regulation of trade. That summer she went to Dumfries to try border thieves, and the following year she held justice eyres throughout the north of Scotland, telling clan chiefs that she intended to continue her late husband's policy of making them responsible for the behaviour of their clansmen.<br>
<br>The Scots viewed Mary of Guise's activities with deep suspicion, and when parliament met early in 1557 she was unpleasantly surprised by the hostility of its members. They complained bitterly that her daughter was still not married to the dauphin, and wondered openly if the wedding would ever take place. The continuing uncertainty undermined the queen regent's position, and although she wanted to fortify the borders against English raids, she doubted whether she would be able to raise the money from her unco-operative subjects. Ruling the country was no easy task, she told the cardinal of Lorraine, adding, &#145;God knows, brother, what a life I lead. It is no small thing to bring a young nation to a state of perfection &hellip;. Happy is he who has least to do with worldly affairs. I can safely say that for twenty years past I have not had one year of rest&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Mary of Guise</span>, 211).<br>
<br>No one was more anxious than Mary of Guise to see her daughter married to the dauphin, but there was little she could do about it, and her position became even more difficult when France went to war with Spain that autumn and Henri instructed her to create a diversion by sending an army to invade England, Spain's ally. She dutifully summoned all able-bodied men between the ages of sixteen and sixty, and addressed them herself, but when they reached the borders the Scots turned and marched home again. Her relatives were, however, in an increasingly influential position at the French court, not least because the duc de Guise had in January 1558 captured Calais from the English. Henri therefore decided to go ahead with his son's marriage to the young Scottish queen.<br>
<br>Scottish commissioners were sent to France to negotiate the contract, the couple were formally betrothed on 19 April, and the marriage finally took place on 24 April 1558. The marriage contract ostensibly safeguarded Scotland's independence and stated that Mary of Guise was to act as regent as long as her daughter was out of the country, but the Scots' worst suspicions would have been realized had they known that Mary, queen of Scots, had also signed secret clauses. If she died childless, Henri II would inherit Scotland and he would enjoy all Scottish revenues until he had been repaid for the money he had spent in defence of his daughter-in-law's kingdom.<h2>
<a name="TheScottishReformation"></a>The Scottish Reformation</h2>Apart from Scottish hostility to the French, the situation in Scotland was complicated by the growing tide of protestantism, and on 1 September 1558, St Giles's day, a riot broke out in Edinburgh when the saint's image was carried in procession through the streets. That winter the protestants presented Mary of Guise with a series of petitions demanding the right to convene publicly or privately, hear services in the vernacular, and take communion in both kinds. They likewise demanded the repeal of all the laws against heresy. Mary regarded their religious demands as a mere cloak for sedition, but they gained a valuable ally when Mary I of England died on 17 November 1558 and her protestant half-sister Elizabeth succeeded to her throne.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1559 protestants pinned to the doors of the Scottish friaries copies of a document known as &#145;beggars' summons&#146;, demanding that the friars give up their property to the poor. The signing of the treaty of Cateau Cambr&eacute;sis that spring brought peace between France and Spain. Scotland and England were comprised in the treaty, but religious disturbances continued in Scotland and Mary of Guise resolved to outlaw the protestant leaders. Shortly before they were to appear before her, John Knox the energetic protestant preacher arrived back in Scotland, and his inflammatory sermon in St John's Church in Perth roused up the townspeople to smash images, tear down furnishings, and drive friars out of their friaries.<br>
<br>Mary of Guise and Ch&acirc;telherault rode to Perth at the head of an army, intending to disperse the protestants, but they were outnumbered and on 29 May 1559 it was agreed that both armies would disband. Mary of Guise entered Perth, gave orders for the repair of the damaged buildings, and replaced the protestant provost with one of her own supporters. She then garrisoned the town with Scottish soldiers in French pay, and withdrew to her palace at Falkland. The lords of the congregation, as the protestant leaders now called themselves, immediately declared that the queen regent had broken the truce and hostilities were renewed.<br>
<br>Mary herself had fallen ill and she remained at Falkland while Ch&acirc;telherault and d'Oysel marched to confront the rebels at Cupar, in Fife. Realizing that they were outnumbered once more, the royal commanders entered into discussions with the rebels and reached a new agreement. The queen regent would grant the protestants freedom of worship, they would disband their army, and the French soldiers would retire to Lothian. Well aware that it was unsafe for her to remain in Fife, Mary crossed to Edinburgh and then sought shelter in Dunbar Castle, on the east coast. If all else failed she could escape from there to France. Her precautions were justified, for the congregation marched to Stirling and then entered the capital.<br>
<br>When she heard that Scotland's coining irons had been seized by the congregation, Mary was affronted. She ordered Ch&acirc;telherault and d'Oysel to march on Edinburgh but, recognizing that they were not strong enough, they seized Leith instead and entered into negotiations once more. Agreement was reached on Leith Links on 23 July 1559. The congregation would deliver up the coining irons and leave Edinburgh the following day. In future they would obey the authority of the queen regent and molest neither churches nor churchmen. In return, Mary would grant the people of Edinburgh freedom of worship and no one would interfere with the protestant preachers. Two days later the royal army entered Edinburgh, the congregation dispersed, and Mary herself returned when order had been restored.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalmonths"></a>The final months</h2>The appearance of peace was no more than an illusion, however, for the protestants were engaged in secret negotiations with Elizabeth I and on 7 August 1559 the English queen sent Sir Ralph Sadler north. He was to stir up further opposition to the French, urge Ch&acirc;telherault to abandon Mary of Guise, and persuade her nobles to force her to make a treaty of perpetual peace with England. Mary meanwhile learned that Henri II had died as the result of a jousting accident and, to add to her troubles, Ch&acirc;telherault's protestant son James, third earl of Arran, arrived back from France. Within twenty-four hours the duc had changed sides and joined the congregation.<br>
<br>Sending urgent pleas to France for assistance, Mary persuaded d'Oysel to fortify Leith, and she took refuge there when she heard that the congregation were marching on Edinburgh once more. Her health was deteriorating rapidly&#151;she seems to have been suffering from chronic heart disease&#151;and her remaining supporters were diminishing daily. Her once sumptuous furnishings were worn and threadbare, and her wardrobe was reduced to a sparse collection of black garments, some of them lined with fur to keep out the cold. Personal splendour no longer mattered. She was desperately short of money, for she had inherited a deficit of &pound;30,000 when she took over as regent from Ch&acirc;telherault, and although an appeal to Rome brought grants of ecclesiastical subsidies, her attempts at introducing new forms of lay taxation aroused great opposition. On 21 October the lords of the congregation announced that her regency was suspended, and transferred her authority to a council of regency under the leadership of Ch&acirc;telherault. Mary sent a defiant reply when she was told, and d'Oysel managed to drive off a protestant assault on Leith. Mary determinedly entered the capital once more but a fortnight later she was so seriously ill that her friends despaired, and reports of her grave condition continued to circulate throughout November. By the end of the month she was said to be recovering a little, although &#145;without hope of long life&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1559&#150;60</i>, 146&#150;7).<br>
<br>The French were enjoying some success in Fife early in the new year when word came on 22 January 1560 that an English fleet had been sighted off the east coast. At the same time a French fleet coming to Mary's aid was driven back by storms. Worse was to follow, for on 27 February 1560 Elizabeth I signed the treaty of Berwick with the congregation, taking Scotland into her protection and promising the protestants her assistance. She then sent an army north to besiege Leith. Mary of Guise left her palace of Holyroodhouse for Edinburgh Castle, where she held lengthy discussions with English envoys in a desperate attempt to play for time. The siege of Leith dragged on, the queen's health continued to decline, and her pleas to her brothers in France for men and money seemed to be going unanswered. Even so, when the bishop of Valence arrived to try to mediate between Scotland and England, he found Mary &#145;in want especially of health and of everything else except greatness of spirit and good understanding, for she is quite undaunted by these troubles&#146;  (Teulet, <span class="italic">Papiers d'&eacute;tat</span>, 1.574).<br>
<br>On 27 May Mary had a relapse and her companions could see that her condition was very grave. She was suffering from dropsy and a high fever, and from 1 June she was unable to take any nourishment. By 7 June she knew that she was dying. She sent for the duc de Ch&acirc;telherault, her stepson Lord James Stewart, and her other lords, urging them to maintain the alliance with France and asking their forgiveness if she had ever offended them. The following evening, at about seven o'clock, she dictated a simple will, requesting that her servants' wages and her debts be paid and nominating her executors. After that, she sank into semi-consciousness and died in Edinburgh Castle about half an hour after midnight on 11 June 1560, Lord James Stewart and Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll, at her side. Her embalmed body lay in state on a black satin bed until it was taken in a lead coffin to St Margaret's Chapel in the castle. There it remained for many months. On 6 July the French, Scots, and English signed the treaty of Edinburgh, agreeing that all foreign soldiers, French and English alike, would withdraw from Scotland, and in August the Scottish parliament passed legislation making the country officially protestant. Not until the following year was permission given for Mary of Guise's burial. On 16 March 1561 her coffin was taken from the castle at midnight and put aboard a ship for France.<br>
<br>Mary of Guise was buried in July at Rheims, in the convent of St Pierre, where her sister was abbess, and a public funeral service was held in the cathedral of Notre Dame, Paris, in the presence of Mary, queen of Scots. The priest who gave the eulogy compared the dead queen to Judith, the heroine in the biblical <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> who had saved her city of Bethulia by cutting off the head of the besieging Assyrian general Holofernes, nor was the comparison inappropriate. Sacrificing her own comfort, interests, and ultimately her life, Mary of Guise had fought a long, desperate, and, in the end, hopeless struggle to preserve Scotland as a pro-French, Roman Catholic nation for her daughter. In so doing, the witty, vivacious, and popular young woman who had been such a favourite at the French court developed qualities of determination and endurance which impressed even her enemies. Charming, highly intelligent, and hard-working, with a diplomatic manner and an ability to fight on regardless of hostility, disappointment, and ill health, Mary was never merely a pawn of the French king. Her correspondence makes it clear that her ambitions were not necessarily those of the French monarchy, and indeed both she and her mother worried that not only Fran&ccedil;ois I and later Henri II but also her own brothers would ignore her interests and simply use her for their own political advantage. While it is true that Mary saw Scotland as an ally for France, she seems to have viewed her daughter's realm as an independent nation, albeit an infant one which she would have to organize and transform into a well-governed state. She intended doing this on her own terms and indeed, if it had not been for her determination, the French would probably have come to an agreement with the English in 1559, rather than having to wait until she was dead.<br>
<br>John Knox detested Mary of Guise because for him she stood for Roman Catholicism and the mass, but later historians have viewed her with a kindly eye. Not only have her biographers, Strickland in the nineteenth century, McKerlie and Marshall in the twentieth, been unanimous in praising her intelligence and fortitude, but other writers discussing mid-sixteenth-century Scotland have also signalled their approval. &#145;Her methods were diverse&#146;, wrote Gordon Donaldson in 1974, &#145;but in the main they were along the lines of conciliation, which was always the key to the successful government of Scotland&#146;  (Donaldson, 35). In the end Mary of Guise failed in what she was trying to do, and the Scots became the protestant allies of England, but her dignity and dedication have won her the lasting admiration of protestants and Catholics alike. Her life is indeed best summed up by the emblem she chose for herself: a crown set above a rock beaten by winds and waves, with the motto &#145;And yet it stands&#146;.<br>
