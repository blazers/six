<span class="headword">Rahere <span class="st"> [Rayer]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1143<span class="mult">x</span>5), <span class="occ">founder of St Bartholomew's Hospital and priory, London</span>, was of unknown origins. The one authoritative source for his life, <span class="italic">Liber fundacionis ecclesiae Sancti Bartholomei Londoniensis</span> written some forty years after his death but existing only in a fifteenth-century text, describes &#145;Rayer&#146; as a man &#145;born of low lineage&#146;  (Moore, BL, Cotton Vespasian B.ix) and with little learning who, as a youth, sought the patronage of the nobility, and inveigled his way into their households with japes and flattery until he became a familiar figure with both king and courtiers through his prominence in courtly revels. At this time, about 1120, there was a canon of St Paul's Cathedral, prebendary of Chamberlainwood (Willesden, Middlesex), called Raherius. Bearing in mind the uncommon name without patronymic, and the strong links at that date between the royal court and St Paul's Cathedral chapter, it would seem probable that prebendary and courtier were one and the same. <span class="italic">The Book of the Foundation</span> continues that, suddenly penitent, Rahere made a pilgrimage to Rome to seek a full pardon. However, falling seriously ill while there, he promised God that he would found a hospital should he be granted recovery. His health was restored and, on the return journey to England, he had a vision of St Bartholomew, who instructed him to build a church at Smithfield. Rahere's friends welcomed him home, though, hearing of his vow, the barons of London advised him that Smithfield lay in the king's market and that Rahere should seek the king's favour. Henry I, impressed by the petitioner, granted him the land, which was consecrated by his supporter Richard de Belmeis, bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1127). The building of the church caused no problem; but Rahere, anxious about opposition to his hospital, gathered together all the materials needed and, with everything ready, erected the building speedily. In the 1180s, when the early history of the priory was written down, the date of the foundation was remembered as March 1123. Rahere, who had chosen to follow the Augustinian rule, became the first prior.<br>
<br>The hospital soon won a reputation for miracles and healing, but disaffected people, seeing Rahere as an arbiter over life or death, planned to kill him. He again petitioned King Henry, who in 1133 granted a charter giving both royal protection and wide-ranging privileges to the young foundation. The author of <span class="italic">The Book of the Foundation</span> says that Rahere became &#145;rich in purity of conscience&#146;, diligent in divine service, sober and prudent, humble towards his brethren and benevolent to his enemies, while gently providing care to the sick and poor  (Moore, fol. 41<i>r</i>). In succeeding centuries, however, his earlier reputation prevailed. John Stow reported that Rahere was &#145;a pleasant-witted gentleman and therefore in his time the king's minstrel&#146;  (Stow, 1.235). In Thomas Deloney's popular tale, <span class="italic">Thomas of Reading</span>, written in the sixteenth century, &#145;Reior&#146; was &#145;the skilfullest musician that lived at that time whose wealth was very great&#146;  (Deloney, 452&#150;3). Rahere was thus frequently portrayed as the king's minstrel or jester. He remained in office as prior until his death. The prologue to book 2 of <span class="italic">The Book of the Foundation</span> states that he died on 20 September &#145;after the years of his prelacie xxii and vi months&#146;  (Moore, fol. 59<i>r</i>); but the writer also declares that the second prior (Thomas, from St Osyth's, Essex) was appointed in 1144 after the space of a year, which seems inconsistent with the earlier statement. Rahere was buried in the priory church, where his effigy, in the Augustinian habit of black cope and white surplice, under a decorated canopy, was placed about 1405. His two works of piety survive; after the Reformation, the choir of the priory church became the parish church of St Bartholomew-the-Great. The hospital, as a separate institution, became one of the world's most influential and respected medical establishments.<br>
