<span class="headword">Bartlett, Sir  Ellis Ashmead</span>  (1849&#150;1902), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born in Brooklyn, New York, on 24 August 1849, was the eldest son of Ellis Bartlett of Plymouth, Massachusetts, a graduate of Amherst College and a good classical scholar, who died in 1852. His mother was Sophia, daughter of John King Ashmead of Philadelphia. On his father's side he was directly descended from Robert Bartlett or Bartelot, of Sussex, who landed on Plymouth Rock from the ship <i>Ann</i> in 1623 and married in 1628 Mary, daughter of Richard Warren, who had sailed in the <i>Mayflower</i> in 1620. On his mother's side he derived, through her father, from John Ashmead of Cheltenham, who settled in Philadelphia in 1682, and, through her mother, from Theodore Lehman, secretary to William Penn, first governor of Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>Ellis and his younger brother, William Lehman Ashmead (later married to Angela Burdett-Coutts), were brought to England in early boyhood by their widowed mother, and were educated at a private school, The Braddons, at Torquay. Ellis showed precocity in classics, but illness interrupted his studies, except in history, of which&#151;aided by an admirable memory&#151;he early gained a wide knowledge. On 16 February 1867 he matriculated from St Mary Hall, Oxford, but soon migrated to Christ Church. A taste for politics asserted itself at Oxford. Becoming the recognized leader of the Conservative Party in the Oxford Union, and an ardent champion of Disraeli, he was elected president of the union in Easter term 1873, defeating H. H. Asquith by a large majority. He was also prominent in athletics. After gaining a third class in moderations, he graduated BA at Christ Church in 1871 with first-class honours in law and history, and proceeded MA in 1874. After leaving Oxford he became an inspector of schools, 1874&#150;7, and an examiner in the privy council office (education department), 1877&#150;80. On 13 June 1877 he was called to the bar from the Inner Temple.<br>
<br>In 1874 Bartlett married Frances Christina (1851/2&#150;1929), daughter of Henry Edward Walsh; they had five sons and three daughters. His liaison with Blanche Hozier, mother of Clementine Churchill, caused a public scandal in 1889.<br>
<br>Bartlett was initially influenced by H. P. Liddon, active in the campaign against the Turks' &#145;Bulgarian atrocities&#146; of 1876, and helped to organize the London conference on them in December 1876. But in 1877&#150;8 he visited Serbia, Bulgaria, and Roumelia and became strongly Russophobic. On his return to Britain he began a vigorous campaign against Russia. In 1880 Lord Beaconsfield assigned to him what was practically the &#145;pocket borough&#146; of Eye, in Suffolk. He held the seat until it was disfranchised under the <span class="roman">Redistribution Bill</span> of 1884. In 1885 he was elected for the predominantly middle-class constituency of the Ecclesall division of Sheffield, for which he sat until his death. Energetic in his loyalty to the Conservative Party, he chiefly devoted himself both inside and outside the House of Commons to the interests of British imperialism as he conceived them. In the house he was untiring in his attacks on Liberal foreign policy and, notably in his first parliament, proved a constant torment to Gladstone. Strident even by the standards of that parliament, he became something of a caricature of a tory imperialist. At the time of the Hozier affair, W. S. Blunt thought him &#145;a rather absurd middle-aged Member of Parliament &hellip; with much underbred pretension &hellip; at whom the world generally laughs&#146;  (Longford, 272). Outside the house he quickly gained an exceptional reputation as a platform speaker, which he maintained throughout his public life. He was probably in greater demand among Conservative organizers of popular meetings than any other speaker, and invariably roused the enthusiasm of his audiences to the highest pitch. His organizing capacity was also of much service to his party. He was chairman of the National Union of Conservative Associations for three years, 1886&#150;8, and he carried on a ceaseless propaganda on behalf of his principles and his party by pamphlets, articles, and letters to the press; characteristic are <span class="italic">Shall England Keep India?</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">Union or Separation</span> (1893). In March 1880 he started <span class="italic">England</span>, the first Conservative penny weekly newspaper, which he maintained at considerable personal loss until 28 May 1898. The paper helped to involve him in financial embarrassments which clouded the closing years of his life.<br>
<br>Bartlett was civil lord of the Admiralty in Salisbury's minority government in 1885, and again in Salisbury's government of July 1886 to August 1892; he was knighted on the fall of the ministry. He published two pamphlets on South Africa, <span class="italic">British, Natives and Boers</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">The Transvaal Crisis</span> (1896). On the outbreak of war between Turkey and Greece in 1897 Sir Ellis went to Constantinople, where the sultan conferred on him the grand cordon of the Mejidiye, and he joined the Turkish army in the field. He was present at the defeat of the Greeks at Mati and was among the first non-combatants to enter Tyrnavo and Larissa (see his account in <span class="italic">The Battlefields of Thessaly</span>, 1897). He was afterwards taken prisoner by the commander of a Greek warship and carried to Athens, but was soon released. When the South African War broke out in South Africa in October 1899, Sir Ellis went to the front and witnessed some early stages of the campaign, in which two of his sons took part. He died, almost penniless, at 18 Langham Street, London, after an operation for appendicitis, on 18 January 1902, and was buried at Tunbridge Wells. His first son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56814/', "Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett (1881&#150;1931)")</script>, was a prominent war correspondent and briefly a tory MP.<br>
