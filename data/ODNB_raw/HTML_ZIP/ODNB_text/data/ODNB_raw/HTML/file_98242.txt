<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Higgins,  Bernardo</span>  (1778&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer and supreme director of Chile</span>, was born Bernardo Riquelme at Chill&aacute;n, Chile, on 20 August 1778, the illegitimate son of Mar&iacute;a Isabel Riquelme de la Barrera y Meza (<i>c</i>.1758&#150;1839), the teenage daughter of a landowner, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20649/', "Ambrosio O'Higgins (c.1721&#150;1801)")</script>, an Irishman who served the Spanish crown as governor of Chile and later as viceroy of Peru. Aged four, he was suddenly removed from his mother by an army lieutenant and taken to Talca, where he was placed under the guardianship of his father's merchant friend Juan Albano Pereira and began his formal education. After many pleas from his mother's family the boy was returned to Chill&aacute;n in 1788 where he entered a school run by Franciscan friars. There he studied alongside Araucanian youths and gained an appreciation of Chile's indigenous past. In 1790 he was taken to Lima and enrolled in the prestigious Colegio San Luis; five years later his viceroy father arranged for him to travel to Europe for further studies.<br>
<br>Bernardo Riquelme lived briefly in Cadiz under the guardianship of the merchant Nicol&aacute;s de la Cruz, and then in 1795 moved to England, where he spent his formative years. He lived in Richmond, Surrey, where he was a pupil at the private Catholic school of Timothy Eeles, and fell in love with his headmaster's pretty daughter, Charlotte Eeles. This ill-fated romance forced him to transfer to an academy in Margate. After his sponsors embezzled his funds, the impoverished young Chilean cut his formal studies short and moved to London, where he fell under the influence of the charismatic Venezuelan advocate of Spanish American independence Francisco de Miranda. Although he had been sad and lonely for much of his time in England, for the rest of his long and eventful life he retained a fondness for its culture and consistently surrounded himself with aides, advisers, military men, and material goods from England. In April 1799 he returned to Cadiz, quarrelled with his guardian, and eventually returned to South America in 1802.<br>
<br>Viceroy O'Higgins had died in 1801, and upon his return Bernardo assumed his father's surname and filed a formal application for legitimization with the colonial authorities in Lima in 1802; the case dragged on for many years and permission to use the O'Higgins name was never officially granted. His honesty and famous name earned him a seat on the town council of Chill&aacute;n in 1806, where he began to build up his personal reputation and power base in the agricultural region of Concepci&oacute;n with its key port city. He also exploited his fluent English to act as interpreter and negotiator between local government officials and the English captains whose ships were stopping along Chilean shores with increasing frequency.<br>
<br>During the confusing crisis that enveloped the Spanish monarchy during the Napoleonic occupation of Spain O'Higgins entered politics at the national level. On 28 February 1811 the provisional government appointed him lieutenant-colonel of the second cavalry regiment on the island of La Laja. A few months later, in May, he entered the newly called congress as the elected deputy for Los Angeles and was assigned a post in the department of war. He was associated with the radical group that advocated republicanism and opposed giving extra representation to the Santiago city delegation. He fell out of favour when Jos&eacute; Miguel Carrera seized control of the government, and he retired to his estate. By the end of 1813, however, military exigencies had drawn O'Higgins into the fight against the Spanish counter-revolutionary force and he quickly rose to the position of commander-in-chief of the patriot army. He signed an ill-starred peace treaty at Lircay in May 1814, but the Spanish colonial officials merely used this as a pretext to buy time and later repudiated it. O'Higgins and the Chilean patriots made a last, desperate attempt to repel the Spanish forces at the battle of Rancagua (1&#150;2 October 1814), but were hopelessly outgunned.<br>
<br>O'Higgins, his mother, and his sister Rosa fled across the Andes to join the other Chilean patriot exiles in Buenos Aires. The family had lost all its possessions and barely made ends meet by selling sweetmeats, rolling cigarettes, and mending clothes. He accepted the offer of the <i>porte&ntilde;o</i> government to join Jos&eacute; de San Mart&iacute;n's patriotic army of the Andes, which was training and victualling in the northern province of Mendoza in preparation for a daring trans-Andean expedition to retake Chile from the Spaniards. Although he was not a particularly good tactician, O'Higgins was a talented organizer who commanded great confidence in his men. He deeply admired San Mart&iacute;n, and placed himself under the Argentinian's authority as a commander of a cavalry division. He led the charge at the battle of Chacabuco on 12 February 1817, which was a turning point in the southern theatre.<br>
<br>Just days after the victory at Chacabuco O'Higgins was elected Chile's second supreme director when San Mart&iacute;n, a foreigner, wisely refused the job. In theory the supreme director enjoyed nearly unlimited centralized powers, issuing decrees and governing without the need to consult a legislature; in practice his ability to rule dictatorially was circumscribed by a strong inclination on the part of the council and populace to participate in governing their own affairs. Determined to entrench the new patriot regime and eliminate all vestiges of Spanish royal power, O'Higgins issued a series of edicts throughout 1817 and 1818. One of his first goals was to restore the health of the economy, which had been damaged by the war, in order to finance the next phase of the independence movement, San Mart&iacute;n's <i>expedici&oacute;n libertadora</i> (liberating expedition) northward into Peru. In February 1817 he confiscated all royalist property in Chile. That month he also established a national military school and a new national army, and ordered the new armed forces to root out all pockets of royalist resistance. He established a national newspaper, the <span class="italic">Gaceta Ministerial de Chile</span>, and established a tribunal to monitor the patriotic activities of the citizenry. The supreme director also took a more controversial step and began to attack the power of the Catholic church; he jailed royalist priests, sent the hostile bishop of Santiago to exile in Mendoza, and appointed a more sympathetic replacement. As a republican O'Higgins abolished aristocratic titles and ordered that all coats of arms and insignias were to be removed from houses and public display, claiming that these distinctions were incompatible with the new republican order. In June 1818 he decreed an end to entailed estates, an unpopular measure that was reversed by the senate the next year. He also announced that henceforth all citizens would be known by the name Chilean regardless of their racial or ethnic origins, and initiated a national census. Over time his orders took a more puritanical turn: he reduced the opening hours of caf&eacute;s, bars, and billiard rooms, eliminated blood sports, and placed a wide array of petty infractions under the jurisdiction of harsh military justice in order to guarantee public order. By 1819 the supreme director was even attempting to ban card games in private houses. He undertook a dramatic modernization and improvement of urban spaces: here his most notable and lasting achievement was the creation of a broad, tree-lined promenade along the river in the southern part of Santiago, later a major thoroughfare bearing his name, the Avenida O'Higgins.<br>
<br>O'Higgins created a naval academy in the port city of Valpara&iacute;so, recruited Thomas Dundonald, Lord Cochrane, to create a Chilean navy, and staffed it with British officers. He sent his close associate Antonio Jos&eacute; de Irisarri to London to solicit political recognition, and he guaranteed freedom of worship to the rapidly expanding British community in his country. He invited James Thomson, as the representative of the British and Foreign Bible Society, to establish Lancasterian schools of mutual education in Chile, and welcomed him with a performance of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Othello</span>. He sponsored the creation of a national library under the directorship of the capable Manuel de Salas. In 1819 O'Higgins decreed that &#145;there will be total and absolute freedom of the press&#146;, but did not construe this to mean the right to slander individuals or the government.<br>
<br>By 1820 O'Higgins's imperious style of government had begun to alienate important sections of the Chilean populace; his attempt to assert the rights of state over church, a lingering suspicion among his political enemies that he was an agent of foreign interests for his close relationships with Argentinians and Englishmen, and, most critically, his failure to adapt to civilian rule, elicited much hostility. In May 1822 he inadvertently insulted Ram&oacute;n Freire and sparked a military rebellion in Concepci&oacute;n which led to his removal from office in January 1823.<br>
<br>O'Higgins left Chile, intending to take up residence in England or Ireland, but instead joined Bol&iacute;var's army in the final stages of the independence wars. Afterwards, he settled in Peru, where he was granted a house at Montalv&aacute;n in Lima, and a hacienda in the Ca&ntilde;ete valley. The liberator of Chile never married and left no legitimate children, although he did raise a natural son known as Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins (possibly from a relationship with Rosario Puga in 1817) and two adopted Araucanian daughters. He lived out his years painting, playing the accordion, engaging in agricultural research, and enjoying the company of his beloved mother and sister Rosa. He died at Lima, of an unidentified virulent illness, on 24 October 1842, and was buried in Lima cemetery in the simple habit of a Franciscan friar. In January 1869 his body was returned to Chile amid great pomp and ceremony and today is buried at the Plaza de la Ciudadan&iacute;a (Citizenship Square) in Santiago. A commemorative plaque and bust mark his period of residence and study at Clarence House, The Vineyard, Richmond.<br>
