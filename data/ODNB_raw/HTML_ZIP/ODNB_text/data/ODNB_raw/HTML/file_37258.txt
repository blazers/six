<span class="headword">Cameron,  Charles</span>  (1745&#150;1812), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 1 June 1745, at Bolton Street, London, the son of Walter Cameron (<i>d</i>. after 1780), master carpenter and speculative builder, and his wife, Hannah. His grandfather Archibald Cameron came from Edinburgh, and Cameron may have been distantly related to the Cameron of Lochiel family. It is certain that the architect's father was closely connected to one of the main figures of the Jacobite rising of 1745, Dr Archibald Cameron, whom he visited in prison before his execution in 1753. It is likely that Walter Cameron took care in London of Dr Cameron's wife and his son Charles, probably named&#151;as was Walter's own son&#151;after the Pretender, before they emigrated to the continent.<br>
<br>In 1760 Charles Cameron was apprenticed to his father in the Carpenters' Company, but about 1764 he developed different interests: an album of 100 drawings consists of remarkable images of vases, plates, and silverwork in a variety of styles (although towards the end of the album his taste for classical antiquity was clearly increasing). It was probably the talent of the young draughtsman that attracted the attention of the architect Isaac Ware. Ware was planning a new edition of Lord Burlington's <span class="italic">Fabbriche antiche</span> (<i>c</i>.1732), a book of engravings from the drawings of Palladio, mostly of Roman baths. After Ware's death in 1766, Cameron wanted to go to Italy, in order to update the drawings of the ancient monuments. Altering the character of the book, he made it a model of Enlightenment scholarship, with an extensive commentary and a strong neo-classical bias. After arriving in Rome in 1768, Cameron spent less than a year there. He may have met Charles Louis Cl&eacute;risseau, the French architectural draughtsman and one of the leading figures in the neo-classical movement, but it is more likely that he learned of his works later, when Cl&eacute;risseau travelled to England in 1771. Certainly Cameron socialized with Jacobites in Rome and they helped him to obtain permission from the Vatican for the excavation of the baths of Titus. In the book of another Charles Cameron&#151;possibly the son of Dr Archibald Cameron&#151;<span class="italic">Memori per le belle arti</span> (1785), the activity of the young architect investigating the Roman thermae is described with sympathy.<br>
<br>Charles Cameron returned to England in 1769, and published his book in folio under the title <span class="italic">The baths of the Romans explained and illustrated, with the restorations of Palladio corrected and improved</span>, with English and French texts, in 1772. Two other editions were issued in 1774 and 1775, but the book did not bring success to the author in spite of the dedication to Lord Bute and other efforts to obtain patronage. During these years Cameron produced his only known architectural work in Britain: drawings for the decoration of Jervoise Clarke's house in Hanover Square, London, built by Cameron's father in 1770&#150;74. In 1774 Cameron applied for a district surveyorship in Middlesex, but did not attend the interview. About this time his financial troubles began: in 1775&#150;6 his father was put into the Fleet prison for debts, and Charles lost the family fortune and his own belongings (including his 1500 books). His father was still in the Fleet when the architect left for Russia.<br>
<br>Cameron arrived in St Petersburg in 1778, in response to an invitation from the Russian court. Catherine the Great had been planning to build a Roman bath in her summer residence, Tsarskoye Selo, for several years, an idea suggested by Cl&eacute;risseau. However, his design, based on the thermae of Diocletian, was too large and the empress looked for a specialist to build a smaller and more private bath for her. Cameron was clearly the best-qualified architect in Europe for the task, although it is likely that Catherine's Scottish physician John Rogerson may have proposed his compatriot. The empress proudly proclaimed Cameron to be a Jacobite and a nephew of Jenny Cameron, &#145;the Pretender's Diana&#146;.<br>
<br>Cameron held a unique position among his Russian contemporaries: he was officially the private architect to the empress and worked only for her and the heir to the throne, the Grand Duke Paul. In 1779&#150;96 he worked at the palace and gardens of Tsarskoye Selo, near St Petersburg. There he created between 1779 and 1786: the private apartments; the Roman thermae, including the cold bath; the Agate Pavilion, decorated with precious stones; a hanging garden; a ramp; and a colonnaded gallery, which was named after him. At the same time he completed the Chinese ensemble in the park, the largest in eighteenth-century Europe. He designed and built the model town of Sofia as part of the landscaping of the park, and constructed there the monumental cathedral of St Sophia. The town united Tsarskoye Selo and Paul's residence, Pavlovsk; here, in 1782&#150;6, Cameron built the palace and several garden pavilions (including the famous Temple of Friendship) and created the 1000 hectare landscape park.<br>
<br>On Catherine's death in 1796, Paul I&#151;hostile to the memory of his mother&#151;dismissed her beloved architect Cameron. After the emperor's murder, however, Cameron returned to Pavlovsk to design garden pavilions for the Dowager Empress Maria, among them his masterpiece the Three Graces. About 1800 he may have made designs for the Baturin palace in Ukraine for Count Kirill Rasumovsky; another Scottish architect, Adam Menelaws, was also involved in this project. It seems that Cameron never left St Petersburg and did not visit Moscow, Ukraine, or the Crimea; his design for a triumphal arch, displayed by J. L. Bond in the Royal Academy in 1793 as &#145;to be erected in the Crimea&#146;, must be the one built at Tsarskoye Selo to celebrate the conquest of the Crimea.<br>
<br>In 1803 Alexander I appointed Cameron to the important post of the architect-in-chief of the admiralty. The next three years were a period of intensive, mostly technical work. In 1806 he left this post to resume his role as the emperor's private architect. In 1784 Cameron had married Catherine Busch (<i>d</i>. 1817), daughter of the British head gardener of Tsarskoye Selo. He died at his home, Ingeneering Castle, St Petersburg, on 26 March 1812. The main collections of his drawings are in the Hermitage and the Academy of Fine Arts museums, the library of the Institute of Railway Engineers in St Petersburg, the Museum of Pavlovsk, and the Museum of Architecture in Moscow.<br>
<br>Cameron was the leader of the neo-classical architectural movement in Russia: he was the first to introduce the Greek revival style, using the publications of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, while the dome of the cathedral of St Sophia was the earliest example of the Byzantine revival style in Russia. Cameron also encouraged the Chinese taste in Russia, inspired by the work of Sir William Chambers. Most importantly, he combined an enthusiasm for the archaeology of antiquity with a firm grasp of English Palladianism, both of which are apparent in the palace at Pavlovsk, which became the model for the country residences of the Russian gentry. Similarly, his park in Pavlovsk established in Russia landscape gardening in the style of Capability Brown: it is considered to be the best one in the country. In fact, Cameron created the &#145;language&#146; of the architecture of the Russian Enlightenment which expressed the spirit of the epoch of Catherine the Great: his buildings became symbols of this period in Russian literature.<br>
