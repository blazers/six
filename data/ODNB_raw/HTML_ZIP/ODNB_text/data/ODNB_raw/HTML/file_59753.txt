<span class="headword">McGuinness,  Norah Allison</span>  (1901&#150;1980), <span class="occ">painter and theatre designer</span>, was born on 7 November 1901 at Lawrence Street, Londonderry, the daughter of Joseph Allison McGuinness, a coal merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCleery. She studied graphic design and painting at the Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, from 1921 to 1924. In her final year there, when she first exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin, she decided to concentrate on painting rather than on book illustration, although the latter remained a source of income throughout her career. Having moved to London, she spent some months during 1924 studying art at the Chelsea Polytechnic. She also received her first important graphic design commission, to produce the illustrations for an edition of Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy</span> which was published in 1925. In the same year she married Geoffrey Phibbs, a librarian from Wicklow, who wrote poetry under the name Geoffrey Taylor. Their marriage broke up in 1929 and they were divorced in 1931.<br>
<br>In 1926 McGuinness began her long involvement with the theatre, designing the sets and costumes for W. B. Yeats's play <span class="italic">Deirdre</span>, first performed at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, that year. In 1927 she designed sets and costumes for the Peacock Theatre in Dublin. The success of these projects led to many more set designs and costumes for the Abbey Theatre, as well as portraits of leading actors. On the advice of a fellow Irish painter, Mainie Jellett, McGuinness went to Paris in 1929 to study privately with the painter Andr&eacute; Lhote; this stay of two years greatly affected her painting style, and she introduced some elements from fauvism and cubism. Her subject matter remained constant&#151;mostly still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes, with a few portraits. As her career progressed, she found her own mature style, employing loose brushwork and a spontaneous approach to her subject. She kept her forms simple and strong, and her colours mostly subdued in range. After ending her studies with Lhote in 1931, she spent a short time travelling in France and then returned to London; she lived and worked in Hammersmith until 1937, and sent paintings to mixed exhibitions at Lucy Wertheim's Gallery, and also showed with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96398', "Seven & Five Society")</script> and the London Group. She had solo exhibitions at Lucy Wertheim's Gallery in 1933, the Zwemmer Gallery in 1934, and the Dublin Painters' Gallery in Dublin in March 1936, shortly after joining the Dublin Painters' Society. McGuinness had two further shows at this venue in 1938 and 1941 and remained a member of the society until about 1950. In her Hammersmith years she resumed her book illustration and produced fashion drawings for the magazines <span class="italic">Bystander</span> and <span class="italic">Vogue</span>.<br>
<br>In 1937 McGuinness returned home to Ireland, where she remained for the rest of her life. She did, however, travel to New York in 1937 and again in 1939, when she had a solo exhibition at the Paul Reinhardt Gallery, and also managed to produce some fashion illustrations for <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span> and window displays for Fifth Avenue department stores, such as Bonwit Tellers. In 1943 she was one of the founder members of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, an annual exhibition held in Dublin devoted to showing avant-garde work; its first exhibition was held in September 1943. This organization was set up in opposition to the somewhat old-fashioned outlook of the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. In September 1944 McGuinness was elected chairman of the committee of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art and in March 1948 became president, a post she held until 1972. She probably gained more praise for her diplomatic role in running this organization than she did for her paintings, and is fondly remembered for her energetic role in seeking out opportunities for living Irish artists. However, McGuinness was elected an honorary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1957, the rival organization that first showed her work in the early 1920s.<br>
<br>In 1950 McGuinness was one of two painters, the other being Nano Reid, chosen to represent Ireland at the Venice Biennale. In the 1950s and early 1960s she showed work at the Dawson Gallery in Dublin, the leading gallery in the city for contemporary art. <span class="italic">Garden Green</span>, a major still life of 1952, is in the collection of the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, and <span class="italic">Shore Pools</span>, a moody landscape from 1965, can be seen at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. McGuinness had a major retrospective exhibition at Trinity College, Dublin, in October 1968, and her last exhibition was at the Taylor Galleries, Dublin, in 1979. Her work is in the collection of the Ulster Museum, Belfast, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, Sligo Museum and Art Gallery, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art in Dublin, and the Hirschhorn Museum, Washington, DC. She died at Monkstown Hospital, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, on 22 November 1980.<br>
