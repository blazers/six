<span class="headword">Nicholson,  William Gustavus</span>, Baron Nicholson  (1845&#150;1918), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the youngest son of William Nicholson Nicholson (born Phillips, in 1827 he assumed the surname and arms of Nicholson), deputy lieutenant and JP, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Abram Rhodes of Wold, Newton Hall, Yorkshire, was born on 2 March 1845 at Mansion House, Roundhay Park, Leeds. He was educated at Leeds grammar school and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he passed out first in his term and was awarded the Pollock medal. In March 1865 he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, and from 1868 to 1871 served on Barbados. He volunteered for service in India and worked in the public works department at Hyderabad and as assistant engineer in the Punjab irrigation branch. In 1873 he transferred to the military works department. He married in 1871 Victoria, daughter of D. Dillon. They had no children, and she survived her husband.<br>
<br>Nicholson accompanied the Kandahar field force in 1878 and the Kurram field force in 1879 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. He served as a field engineer in Afghanistan, fighting in the engagements at the Shutar Gardan Pass, Charasia, and distinguished himself during the defence at Lataband. In 1880 he accompanied Sir Frederick Roberts from Kabul to Kandahar, fighting in the battle on 1 September outside the city. He was awarded a brevet majority for his services in Afghanistan, where he established a reputation as a skilled staff officer. Perhaps more importantly he attracted Roberts's attention. In 1880 he was appointed secretary to the defence committee responsible for examining coast and frontier defences in India.<br>
<br>In 1882 Nicholson served with the Indian contingent during the Egyptian campaign, taking part in the battle of Tell al-Kebir. In 1884 he accompanied Sir Robert Sandeman and Sir Charles Metcalfe MacGregor on a reconnaissance mission in Baluchistan. From 1885 to 1890 he was assistant adjutant-general, Royal Engineers, in India, working with the defence committee. In 1886&#150;7 he served in Burma as assistant adjutant-general, being mentioned in dispatches and awarded the brevet of lieutenant-colonel. He acted as military secretary to Roberts, the commander-in-chief, from 1890 to 1893, after which he worked for two years in the military works department as chief engineer on the north-west frontier. In 1895 he was appointed deputy adjutant-general of the Punjab command. He served as chief of staff with the Tirah expeditionary force in 1897&#150;8, under Sir William Lockhart, carrying out punitive operations against the Afridis in Tirah. In 1898 he was created KCB for his services, and appointed adjutant-general in India.<br>
<br>Roberts requested that Nicholson join him as military secretary following the initial disasters of the South African War. In February 1900 Nicholson was appointed director of transport, in which capacity he exerted an important influence on the campaign. He also participated in operations in the Orange Free State&#151;including Paardeberg, Poplar Grove, Driefontein, and the Vet and Zand rivers. He also took part in the fighting near Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Diamond Hill in the Transvaal. In November 1900 he returned to England, and for his services was twice mentioned in dispatches; in October 1900 he was promoted major-general.<br>
<br>Following the appointment of Roberts as commander-in-chief, Nicholson was promoted lieutenant-general and offered in November 1901 the post of director-general of mobilization and intelligence at the War Office. He proved a great success, overseeing the preparation of detailed defence plans and the collection of intelligence, laying the foundations for a modern general staff despite strong opposition. Following the reorganization of the War Office in 1904, Nicholson was eventually appointed as chief British military attach&eacute; with the Japanese army in Manchuria. In July 1904 he joined the Second Army, which he accompanied during the battle of Liaoyang and its later capture. Despite bad health he remained in the Far East until January 1905 before returning to England.<br>
<br>Nicholson succeeded Sir Hubert Plumer as quartermaster-general in December 1905 and the following year was promoted general. In 1908 he succeeded Sir Neville Lyttelton as chief of the Imperial General Staff and the same year was made a GCB. During his tenure of office Nicholson played a crucial part in devising new strategic plans, in the reorganization of the British army, and in the consolidation of the Territorial Force and of a modern general staff. He was made an aide-de-camp general to George V in 1910, promoted field marshal in 1911, and raised to the peerage on retiring from the army council in 1912. Later the same year he was appointed chairman of the army in India committee, created to inquire into the role and cost of the Indian army. After a year in India examining evidence he returned home when its report was submitted in 1913. The outbreak of the war, however, prevented its controversial recommendations being implemented.<br>
<br>Nicholson served on the committee of imperial defence during the war, participating in the commissions of inquiry into the Dardanelles and Mesopotamia campaigns. He also acted as chairman of the London Territorial Force Association and in October 1916 was made colonel-commandant of the Royal Engineers. He died on 13 September 1918 at his home at 51 Pont Street, Chelsea, London, and his body was interred four days later at Brompton cemetery. At his death the peerage became extinct.<br>
<br>Nicholson enjoyed a brilliant yet rather unusual military career, mostly in India. He was a gifted staff officer and military administrator, but his career was dogged by a reputation for being difficult to handle: he was known as Old Nick. Despite never having personally commanded a unit or passed Staff College, exceptionally he rose to field marshal and held the office of chief of the Imperial General Staff through sheer hard work, personal intelligence, and ability.<br>
