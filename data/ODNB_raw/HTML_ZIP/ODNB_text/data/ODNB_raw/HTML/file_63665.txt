<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maule,  Henry</span>  (1676&#150;1758), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Meath and educational reformer</span>, was the son of William Maule, comptroller of the customs at Dublin, and Jane, daughter of Roger West. Born perhaps at Arklow, Ireland, and educated at Mr Young's school in Dublin, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1691, aged fifteen. He graduated BA in 1696 and later received the degrees of LLB and LLD (in 1719) from the same institution. He was ordained in 1699, and in 1702 he was beneficed in the diocese of Cloyne. His preferment led to a protracted dispute between the bishop, eager to uphold his rights of presentation, and a too independent vicar-general. The wrangle seems to have stimulated Maule's own legal skills and brought him to the attention of clerical superiors, notably Archbishop King of Dublin. In 1706 he was appointed rector of St Mary's, Shandon, in the north of Cork city, a populous parish reckoned to yield an annual &pound;300. There he presided over the establishment of almshouses and a charity school, complete with library. He put into effect what he had seen as he travelled in the Low Countries and England, and what he had read about in Halle. He became a corresponding member of the SPCK, whose London meetings he attended in 1716 and 1718. When in Dublin to forward business he helped to organize an association modelled on the SPCK. Maule used some of his own ample means to finance the Shandon initiatives. His pamphlet of 1721, <span class="italic">Pietas Corcagiensis</span>, shrewdly publicized what had been achieved through gifts of money and books and the record of pupils already apprenticed to tradespeople in the locality. As a member of a family enriched by office-holding, and married to Lady Anne Barry, daughter of Richard, second earl of Barrymore, he moved confidently among those whose support was vital to his charitable endeavours. Some contemporaries disliked the political and diplomatic dexterity which he displayed. He was suspected, too, of a residual toryism. These traits, when coupled with his birth and upbringing in Ireland and a supposed attachment to Irish as against English interests, delayed further preferment. In 1720 he was appointed dean of Cloyne. Despite the low yield of the deanery (&pound;60 or &pound;70 p.a.), he carried out physical improvements there. He missed the lucrative deaneries of Derry and Down, but in 1726 he was consecrated bishop of Cloyne. In 1732 he was translated to Dromore and then in 1744 to Meath. Following the death of his first wife Maule married twice again, first Catherine Rooth, formerly Stawell, and second, in 1725, Dorothy Roffen (<i>d</i>. 1755), a widow of Rossmore.<br>
<br>Much of the credit for drawing the hitherto haphazard ventures to provide protestant education into a coherent system through the Incorporated Society of 1733 went to Archbishop Boulter. However, in 1746 the then lord lieutenant, Chesterfield, gave Maule his due when he acknowledged that without the latter's &#145;care and perseverance&#146;, the charity schools &#145;would hardly have existed&#146;  (J. Ainsworth, ed., <span class="italic">The Inchiquin Manuscripts</span>, 1961, 160). As bishop of Dromore he continued to set an example, subsidizing a charter school at Ballynahinch. Ardbraccan, his seat as bishop of Meath, saw a similar venture. He also backed the projects of the Royal Dublin Society and the Physico-Historical Society to survey and publicize the natural resources of Ireland as a prelude to their more effective exploitation. In 1733 he made the work of protestant instruction the theme of his sermon before the lord lieutenant and House of Lords on the anniversary of the 1641 uprising. Through a network of schools he aimed to entrench the British and protestant interests in Ireland and bit by bit overcome what he&#151;in common with many contemporaries&#151;saw as the linked evils of ignorance, idleness, and Catholicism. He argued that only by concentrating on the training of the young could the future prosperity and stability of Ireland within the Hanoverian empire be secured. These views differed from those of his fellow Church of Ireland clergyman John Richardson, who wished to use the Irish language to win converts, and it was Maule's approach which was adopted in eighteenth-century Ireland. Maule died on 13 April 1758.<br>
