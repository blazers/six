<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1779&#150;1863), <span class="occ">mining manager and entrepreneur</span>, was born on 22 August 1779 at 75 Gildengate, Colegate, Norwich, the eldest of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "John Taylor (1750&#150;1826)")</script>, yarn manufacturer and dissenting minister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27082/', "Susannah Taylor (1755&#150;1823)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "Taylor, John (1750&#150;1826)")</script>]. The many activities of his father included being a Hebrew scholar, as well as a hymn writer and founding the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. Taylor was apprenticed as a land surveyor and civil engineer. In 1798, at the age of nineteen, he was appointed manager of the Wheal Friendship copper mine near Mary Tavy, Devon, as a result of his family's connection by marriage with the Martineau family, who owned shares in the mine. At his instigation major improvements were made to the mine, including the introduction of advanced methods for dressing copper ore and the construction of the Tavistock Canal, which provided water transport between the mine and the port of Morwellham. At this time he also took a direct financial interest in the reopening of the neighbouring Wheal Crowndale mine. In these early years he developed a reputation for being an innovator of the latest mining technology and for developing mines by the heavy investment of capital, which was contrary to normal practice within the industry. On 14 October 1805 he married Ann Rowe Pring of Awliscombe, Devon, the adopted daughter of Dr Thomas Burnaford, who was a surgeon to many of the mines in the Tavistock area. They had two sons, John (<i>b</i>. 1808) and Richard (<i>b</i>. 1810).<br>
<br>In 1812 Taylor established a chemical works for the manufacture of vitriol in Stratford, Essex, with his brother, Philip, and with the financial backing of the Martineau family. This company later diversified into mechanical engineering and it manufactured printing equipment for Marc Isambard Brunel. The Taylor brothers also formed a separate company for producing gas from oil. John Taylor withdrew from these businesses in the 1820s as he increased his involvement in metal mining. The expansion of his mining activities led him in turn to go into partnership with his sons in 1837.<br>
<br>Taylor became involved in all the major metal-mining areas of the British Isles, either by himself or through the firm of John Taylor &amp; Sons. This included acting as mineral agent to a number of great estates, including those of the duke of Devonshire and the duchy of Cornwall. He also served as secretary of the Wheal Friendship mine in Devon; as inspector of the Greenwich Hospital mines; and as adviser to the commissioners of woods and forests regarding their mineral property. John Taylor &amp; Sons also owned the Charlestown tin-smelting works in Cornwall, owned shares in numerous mining companies, and leased and managed mines throughout Britain and Ireland. Under Taylor's influence and through his extensive business operations, efficient mining equipment was introduced in all the major metal-mining areas. Similarly his distinctive management and employment practices were widely adopted, including the extensive use of the tribute system of paying miners in proportion to the quantity and quality of ore mined (a system admired by Charles Babbage and John Stuart Mill).<br>
<br>Taylor's activities were also international. In 1824 he became involved in the South American mining boom, and was instrumental in founding the British Real del Monte Mining Company and the Bolanos Mining Company in Mexico. These proved relatively unsuccessful, and the London-based management was criticized for failing to appreciate the difficult local conditions. Taylor was later involved in the Nouveau Mond Gold Mining Company, which operated in California and Spain, the Spanish mines of the Linares Lead Mining Company, and other mining activities in France, Germany, Italy, and Australia.<br>
<br>Taylor developed an interest in science and education and the dissemination of scientific knowledge, to which he applied his administrative skills. He was an early member of the Geological Society of London and later became its vice-president; he was also its treasurer from 1816 to 1847. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1825 and was an early member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was one of the founders of the University of London (later University College, London) in 1826 and served on its council and committee of management; he was treasurer from 1842 to 1860. He was also involved in the founding of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and was its treasurer from 1831 until 1861. Through his involvement in the British Association, he was instrumental in the founding of the Museum of Economic Geology in 1839 for the collection of mining data. He was the author of <span class="italic">Statements Concerning the Profits of Mining in England</span> (1825); he edited <span class="italic">Records of Mining</span> (1829), in which he advocated the establishment of a mining school in Cornwall; and he contributed numerous articles to scientific journals.<br>
<br>Taylor maintained a reputation for honesty and trustworthiness in his business dealings, as well as for managerial and financial expertise. Towards the end of his life, when affected by ill health, he withdrew from mining to devote himself to his other interests. He died at his home, 31 Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on Easter day, 5 April 1863, aged eighty-four. The family business continued in operation as an international mining concern until 1969.<br>
