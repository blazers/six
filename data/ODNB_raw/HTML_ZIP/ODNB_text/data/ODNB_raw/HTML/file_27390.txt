<span class="headword">Throckmorton <span class="st"> [Throgmorton]</span>,  Francis</span>  (1554&#150;1584), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic conspirator</span>, was the son of Sir John Throckmorton (<i>c</i>.1518&#150;1580) of Feckenham in Worcestershire and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1591), daughter of Robert Puttenham. The Throckmorton or Throgmorton family first emerged from relative obscurity in the early part of the fifteenth century, when the lawyer John Throgmorton (<i>d</i>. 1445) rose to the office of chamberlain of the exchequer, or under-treasurer of England. This John married an heiress who brought Coughton in Warwickshire into the family, and his great-grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38067/', "Sir George Throckmorton")</script> took them further up the social ladder by becoming an esquire of the body to Henry VIII, flourishing in spite of his outspoken disapproval of the king's divorce from Katherine of Aragon. He married the daughter of Lord Vaux of Harrowden and produced a numerous family. Sir John, father of Francis, was the fifth of seven sons and, like his forebear and namesake, was trained to the law. Following the break with Rome several of the Throckmorton brothers adopted the new reformed religion, but John, possibly influenced by his wife, remained a staunch Catholic and consequently did well under Queen Mary, who rewarded his loyal service with the office of puisne justice of Chester. By 1565 he had risen to become vice-president of the council in the marches of Wales and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, which means that he must have conformed, outwardly at least, to the established church, but his sons Francis and Thomas were certainly brought up as Catholics.<br>
<br>Little seems to be known about Francis Throckmorton's early life, although he was described by William Camden as &#145;a gentleman well-educated and of good wit&#146;  (Camden, 846). He matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1572 and four years later he was entered as a student of the Inner Temple. At about this date he married Anne, also known as Agnes, Sutton (<i>c</i>.1554&#150;1605), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8148/', "Edward Sutton, fourth Baron Dudley")</script>, and his first wife, Catherine Brydges; though the marriage contract is dated 3 June 1571, the precise date of the marriage&#151;which produced a son, John (<i>d</i>. in or after 1604)&#151;is unknown. In 1578 the family's Catholic sympathies began to get them into trouble, when the headmaster of Shrewsbury School affirmed before Justice George Bromley that Lady Throckmorton and others had heard mass in the house of her brother-in-law; &#145;that one Hughes was the chief sayer and came from beyond the sea&#146;; that he taught the son of Sir John Throckmorton; and that these priests distributed &#145;certain Beads called Pardon Beads and another monument called Agnus Dei&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Whitgift</span>, 2.83). As a result Francis was committed to the custody of the dean of St Paul's to be examined on suspicion of &#145;being present at exercises of religion contrary to present practices&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, February 1578). But his protestant cousins interceded for him and he was freed after a month.<br>
<br>In 1579 John Throckmorton, now chief justice of Chester, was accused of having shown undue partiality in a case before him. Suspended from office, fined and disgraced, he died a year later a broken man. By this time Francis was already dabbling in treason. He and his brother Thomas had gone abroad at some time prior to their father's death and Francis had become involved with the English Catholic expatriates gathered at Spa in the Low Countries, discussing with them &#145;the altering of the state of the realme here; and how the same might be attempted by forraine invasion&#146;  (&#145;A discovery&#146;, 191). He had had &#145;sundrie conferences&#146; on this dangerous topic with Sir Francis Englefield, once a member of Queen Mary's privy council, and had been put in touch with Thomas Morgan in Paris. His brother stayed on in France, but Francis Throckmorton was back in England by the early 1580s to join the small but growing band of idealistic young Catholic laymen eager to serve the cause of Rome and the captive queen of Scots.<br>
<br>In April 1583 Francis Walsingham received a report from Henry Fagot, his agent inside the French embassy, that Francis Throckmorton had dined with the ambassador, having recently sent the Scottish queen the sum of 1500 crowns, &#145;which is on the ambassador's account&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 432). A month later Fagot wrote again with the information that &#145;the chief agents for the Queen of Scots are M. Throckmorton and Lord Henry Howard. They never come to bring things from her except at night&#146;  (Bossy, 200). This, together with further reports of &#145;what secret resorts he had to the French ambassador, what long and private conferences at seasons suspicious&#146;  (ibid., 203), was enough for Walsingham to set a watch on Throckmorton and in November he was arrested at his London house. He just had time to destroy a letter he was in the act of writing to the queen of Scots and send a maidservant with a casket of incriminating documents to the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino Mendoza, but among his seized papers was a list of the names of &#145;certain Catholic noblemen and gentlemen&#146; and also details of harbours &#145;suitable for landing forraine forces&#146;  (&#145;A discovery&#146;, 192). Confronted with these Throckmorton at first &#145;impudently&#146; denied they were his, saying they must have been planted by the government searchers, but later admitted they had been left in his chamber by a man named Nutby who had since fled the realm. When he refused to say any more he was put on the rack and &#145;somewhat pinched&#146;, but &#145;continued in his former obstinacy and denial of the truth&#146;  (ibid., 191). He managed to smuggle a message out to Mendoza, written in cipher on the back of a playing card, saying he would die a thousand deaths before he betrayed his friends, but, racked a second time, he broke down and &#145;yielded to confess anything he knew&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Walsingham had long suspected the existence of some &#145;great hidden treason&#146; involving Mary, queen of Scots, her friends in Scotland, the Jesuits, and either France or Spain&#151;perhaps both. Now Throckmorton revealed that it was Mary's formidable kinsman, the duke of Guise, who had been preparing to lead an invasion of England with the declared objective of releasing the queen of Scots and forcing Elizabeth to grant the Catholics a measure of toleration. The real intention, however, was to remove Elizabeth from her crown and state. The foreign forces were ready, the king of Spain would bear half the cost, while Francis Throckmorton and his brother (who had returned secretly to England during the summer), together with the Spanish ambassador, were to organize a welcoming committee of Catholic gentlemen at the port of Arundel in Sussex, which had been chosen by Guise for his landing. Throckmorton's confession did not tell the whole story&#151;his had always been a subordinate role&#151;but Walsingham now knew that it was the Spanish rather than the French ambassador who had been abusing his diplomatic privileges. He was also now able to make some further arrests, although most of those in the plot, including Thomas Throckmorton, had had time to make their escape and in the end it was only Francis who suffered the death penalty.<br>
<br>Francis Throckmorton remains a somewhat shadowy figure, but an anonymous correspondent was to write of &#145;the good partes wherewith he was indued, and of the pleasant humour that for the most part did possesse him when hee came in companie of friendes&#146;  (&#145;A discovery&#146;, 191). He was undoubtedly sincere in his convictions. After first making his confession he had exclaimed in obvious distress: &#145;Nowe I have disclosed the secrets of her who was the deerest thing to me in the worlde (meaning the Scottish Queene) &hellip; and sith I have failed of my faith towards her, I care not if I were hanged&#146;  (ibid., 195). At his trial he attempted to retract the matters he had confessed because the rack had forced him to say something to ease the torment. He was executed at Tyburn on 10 July 1584 and was reported to have died &#145;very stubbornly&#146;, refusing to ask for the queen's forgiveness. He was survived by his wife and son. Anne Throckmorton subsequently married Thomas Wilmer (<i>d</i>. 1628), barrister, with whom she had two sons and two daughters.<br>
