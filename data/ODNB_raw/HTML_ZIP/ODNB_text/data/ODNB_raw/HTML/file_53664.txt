<span class="headword">Wood,  George Arnold</span>  (1865&#150;1928), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Salford, Lancashire, on 7 June 1865, eldest son of George Stanley Wood (1840&#150;1914), a cotton merchant, and Martha Pickering, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alliott (1839/40&#150;1871). He grew up in a nonconformist household that was strongly attached to the Liberal Party. He was educated at Mrs Hunt's school, Bowdon, Cheshire, and then went to Bowdon College before going to Owens College, Manchester, in 1882. After graduating in 1885 he entered Balliol College, Oxford, gaining a BA with first-class honours in 1888 and an MA two years later. In October 1888 he enrolled in the Congregational Mansfield College, Oxford, but while at Balliol he had begun to lose his faith. He abandoned theology and in 1890 accepted the newly established Challis chair of history at the University of Sydney, thus becoming the first occupant of a history chair in Australia.<br>
<br>Wood reached Sydney in February 1891 and remained there for the next thirty-seven years. He alone taught history until 1916 when he was joined by a former student, J. F. Bruce. Life was arduous but pleasurable and stimulating, for the small university staff was composed mainly of Oxford and Cambridge graduates whose company proved congenial. Gregarious by nature and fond of sport and outdoor activities, Wood was also a devoted family man. On 27 December 1898 at Marrickville he married Eleanor Madeline Whitfeld (1876&times;8&#150;1967), daughter of Edwin Whitfeld, former fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and currently a master at Sydney grammar school, and his wife, Eleanor Cooke. Wood's wife, a former student and first-class honours history graduate with wide intellectual interests, proved an ideal companion. The couple had three sons and a daughter and formed a close-knit family, from which Wood drew great strength.<br>
<br>Wood had attended Oxford University at a time when the study of history was being placed on a new footing by the regius professor, William Stubbs, a disciple of the German empirical school founded by von Ranke. Wood was deeply influenced by Stubbs and throughout insisted on the need for research to be based on original sources. Yet he also stressed that the writing of history was a creative process calling for the use of imaginative powers. He saw his subject as a moral force capable of influencing the present and providing direction for the future. Wood sought to develop in his students an appreciation of the &#145;noble and the good&#146; and to instil them with those Liberal beliefs, particularly of a Gladstonian variety, which influenced his own outlook. Far from aiming at objectivity the historian must give full expression to his own personal feelings and political creed.<br>
<br>Such an approach strongly influenced Wood's writing and teaching. The burdens of office prevented him from publishing much and he produced only two books, <span class="italic">The Discovery of Australia</span> (1922) and the much slighter <span class="italic">Voyage of the Endeavour</span> (1925). A manuscript dealing with early New South Wales was not accepted, but chapters did appear in the journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, to which he contributed other articles. He also completed a chapter on oceanic exploration for the Australian volume of the <span class="roman">Cambridge History of the British Empire</span>, but it did not appear. Wood's writings were original, stimulating, thoroughly researched, and sometimes, particularly in the case of his article on convicts, controversial. It was for his work as a teacher, however, that he was most noted. He established a warm relationship with his students, excited their curiosity, and widened their intellectual horizons. His lectures, neatly written and preserved among his papers, dealt with large issues and bore testimony to the strength of his belief in liberalism. He taught mostly British and European history from the middle ages, but he also developed an interest in British imperial history and made occasional incursions into the Australian past. This was a field that engrossed his attention after he became aware of the rich documentary sources through his association with two government-sponsored projects for the publication of the historical records, first of New South Wales, then of Australia. He encouraged postgraduate research in Australian history but thought the secondary literature inadequate for undergraduate purposes.<br>
<br>Wood saw his purpose as extending beyond the university into the broader community. As a professor he bore responsibilities for history in the secondary schools and he played a major role in determining the syllabus and setting, as well as examining, the two public examinations. He had well-developed ideas about how history should be taught in all levels at school and he worked hard to guide teachers. A great encourager, he involved himself in the work of the Royal Australian Historical Society and gave active assistance to a number of amateur writers. One of his first tasks after arriving in Sydney was to deliver a public inaugural lecture, &#145;The study of history&#146;, and thereafter he lectured regularly for community groups and the university's extension board. He was also active in the Workers' Educational Association from 1914 and displayed concern for the underprivileged. He had a strong interest in contemporary issues, served for a long time as a correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and was a member of the New South Wales branch of both the Institute of International Affairs and the Institute of Pacific Relations.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1928 Wood committed suicide while undergoing treatment for shingles at a private hospital in Randwick, Sydney. His death was as tragic as his life was fruitful. A man whose courage was reflected in the way he withstood public opprobrium for opposing Britain's involvement in the South African War, he was noted for his integrity and high principle. Regarded with respect and affection by students and colleagues, he added fresh dimensions to Australian culture and contributed to the professionalization of history, laying the foundations for a strong history department at Sydney University. The Wood tradition was taken to Melbourne University by Wood's student and biographer, Professor R. M. Crawford, and it also influenced others who rose to literary, academic, and professional prominence.<br>
