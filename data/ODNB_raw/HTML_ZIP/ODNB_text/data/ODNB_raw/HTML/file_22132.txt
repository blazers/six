<span class="headword">Philipps,  Rowland</span>  (1467/8&#150;1538?), <span class="occ">college head</span>, hailed from the diocese of Worcester; a witness statement which he swore in May 1527 when he was sixty would indicate that he was born in 1467 or 1468. He was educated at Oxford, where he had taken his MA degree by 1491. Philipps was elected a fellow of Oriel College, acting as collector of rents and then as junior treasurer between 1491 and 1494, and was tutor to the Benedictine monks of Gloucester College. He was ordained subdeacon to the title of his fellowship on 23 March 1493 and deacon on 6 April, and was priested on 1 June. He also served a stint as senior proctor of the university between 1496 and 1497. His accounts for the year survive.<br>
<br>Having surrendered his proctor's robes, Philipps exchanged Oriel for Croydon, where he was admitted vicar on 4 June 1497. This was the first in a string of clerical preferments in London, Surrey, and Sussex, including a canonry of St Paul's (with the prebend of Neasdon) between 1517 and 1536, and the rectory of St Michael Cornhill. Philipps was also collated as precentor of Hereford and rector of Walford-on-Wye in 1524, which carried a pension of &pound;32 when vacated in 1531. One of his tasks on departing his London benefice of St Margaret Pattens in 1515 was to act as executor for a chantry priest of the parish, William Broke. Philipps, dubbed &#145;my synguler goode maister&#146;, was instructed to put Broke's chattels to charitable use. He himself had the benefit of 20<i>s</i>. in money and the priest's best feather bed and bolster. Philipps clearly kept up his Oxford contacts during this time: Oriel made him a perpetual commoner and rented him a room, and he supplicated for his BTh in 1508 and his DTh in 1522. By 1525 he was a licentiate of medicine.<br>
<br>Philipps was already a celebrated public preacher by the end of Henry VII's reign. A manuscript of Anselm's <span class="italic">Opera</span>, which was once in Philipps's possession and is partly in the hand of William of Malmesbury, contains a note in sixteenth-century script referring to his sermons at Paul's Cross. He preached at the funeral of Giles, Lord Daubeney, in May 1508, and during Archbishop Warham's visitation of the diocese of Canterbury in 1511. His skill won him royal favour. By 1510 he was chaplain to the young Henry VIII, drawing a salary of 20<i>s</i>. The king's book of payments continues to record Philipps's name for the next dozen years. This was not a sinecure, since he is known to have preached before King Henry in 1521. The sermon may not have been well received; Richard Pace quipped to Wolsey that Philipps would have done better to preach, as another had that day, on the ballads &#145;Passe tyme wyth goodde cumpanye&#146; and &#145;I love unlovydde&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/1, no. 1188). He also made himself unpopular at the funeral of Thomas Ruthall, bishop of Durham, in 1523. In the presence of a duke, five earls, and much of the court besides, Philipps delivered &#145;a noble sermon and a clerckely&#146;, but preached for so long that his congregation became fractious, eager to be away to the &#145;great and &hellip; sumptuouse feast&#146; that followed at Durham House  (Gunn, 83). His zeal even won Philipps a place in Thomas More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>. Long tradition has it that More's anonymous academic, eager to be sent on a papal mission as bishop of Utopia, as none other than the vicar of Croydon.<br>
<br>It was presumably Philipps's reputation as a preacher that won him election as warden of Merton College, Oxford, in 1521. It was a curious appointment: Philipps was the first head of that house who had previously been neither a scholar nor a fellow there. His advent had some impact on the religious life of the college, which became newly punctilious in observing its benefactors' obits in chapel. But his time at Merton was brief. In 1524 Philipps attempted to strike a deal with the college: he would resign, but only if Dr Thomas Musgrave was not on the list to succeed him. Musgrave, a physician who had lectured in astronomy, had already served as dean, bursar, and subwarden. Merton refused; Philipps was replaced by John Chambers the year after.<br>
<br>Philipps had other patrons besides the king. Warham also retained him as a chaplain (rather than Wolsey, as claimed by Emden), although Philipps complained after Warham's death that he had been out of the archbishop's favour for seven years. His relations with Thomas Wolsey, too, were sometimes more abrasive than amicable. According to Polydore Vergil, Philipps became embroiled in the opposition of both convocations to the cardinal's haughty attempts to secure a clerical subsidy in 1523. Supported by the bishops of Winchester and Rochester, this &#145;splendid preacher&#146; commanded the resistance to Wolsey, which collapsed only after the cardinal had summoned Philipps for a personal interview &#145;and so frightened him that he afterwards appeared no more in convocation, thereby very gravely impairing his integrity&#146;  (Gwyn, 287). Even if Vergil's account can be believed, the skirmish did not prevent Philipps from acting as Wolsey's agent in the sensitive case of the abbot of Wigmore, Herefordshire, in August 1529. Wolsey had appointed John Smart as the head of this Augustinian house in 1518, but he did not prove a success, and Philipps was deputed to encourage him to resign. Smart, however, refused the proffered 40 marks pension, and told Philipps that Wolsey's authority would soon be extinguished. On another occasion Philipps petitioned Wolsey on behalf of poor prisoners in the Marshalsea, and solicited his support for one of Philipps's former pupils, prior of the Benedictine house at Binham, Norfolk, who was vexed with thieves and lawsuits. Philipps also heard cases in the court of requests in 1528&#150;9.<br>
<br>It was with the onset of religious reformation that Philipps's previously brisk career began to go awry. In 1531 formal proceedings of <i>praemunire</i> were initiated against him and several other clerics, implying that Philipps had opposed the king's intended annulment of his marriage in the convocation of 1529, although he was soon pardoned by name. His sermons were similarly too conservative for the court of the early 1530s. By 1533 he was in prison, writing a lament to Thomas Cromwell that he was troubled by age and disease, and had lost his canonry of St Paul's through his absence. His offence is obscure, but may have involved spreading a seditious rumour&#151;unwittingly, as he claimed. Philipps was plainly deemed sufficiently important to be kept under surveillance by the government, since Cromwell made a personal note of his sermon &#145;Pax vobis&#146;, and of &#145;the taking of the vicar of Croydon&#146; in 1533  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 6, no. 137). News of Philipps was also frequently relayed to Lord Lisle in Calais.<br>
<br>In 1534 Philipps was licensed by the king to debate with the evangelical Hugh Latimer, and was subsequently rumoured to have been sent to the Tower. Thomas More, however, wrote to his daughter Margaret Roper that Philipps took the oath of supremacy when summoned to Lambeth in April 1534, and was detained no further. Philipps was evidently relieved at the outcome; More observed, somewhat acidly, that &#145;the vicar of Croydon, either for gladness or dryness, or to show that he was known to the Archbishop, went to the buttery bar and drank &#147;valde familiariter&#148; [in a very familiar manner]&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 575). Philipps was still identified to Cromwell in 1535 as being &#145;of the popish sort&#146;, but useful with it, since his preaching might be more effective in persuading recalcitrant religious to submit to the king. Philipps was amenable, as witness an anxious note from the bishop of London in July 1536: it was most important that Cromwell should be informed &#145;with what zeal Roland Philipps at this time last year, labored in our presence to bring the Carthusians into obedience to the King as head of this Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 11, no. 186). But Philipps had his enemies still, since William Marshall identified him in August 1536 as being among the &#145;rabblement of seditious preachers&#146; who had escaped punishment  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 11, no. 325). He remained under suspicion until the end. Philipps was cited by Cranmer for examination in 1538, excusing himself, as in 1535, on grounds of illness. He probably died the same year&#151;his Croydon benefice was vacant by May 1538.<br>
