<span class="headword">Bellamy,  James</span>  (1819&#150;1909), <span class="occ">college head</span>, born on 31 January 1819 in the school house of Merchant Taylors' School, then in Suffolk Lane, London, was elder son in the family of two sons and three daughters of James William Bellamy BD (1788&#150;1874). The father (of an old Huguenot family settled in Norfolk and Lincolnshire) was headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School from 1819 to 1845. His mother was Mary, daughter of Thomas Cherry BD, headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1795 to 1819. In 1822 the father, while still headmaster, became vicar of Sellinge, Kent, a living which he held until his death in 1874. The son James entered Merchant Taylors' School in June 1826. The <span class="italic">Merchant Taylors' Magazine</span> (1833&#150;4) contains three poems by him. In 1836 he was elected scholar (leading to a fellowship) at St John's College, Oxford. He graduated BA, with a second class in classics and a first class in mathematics, in 1841. In that year he was librarian of the Oxford Union Society. Although he was not a follower of the Tractarians, he was an admirer of J. H. Newman, whose sermons at St Mary's he attended, and became a friend of Charles Marriott and E. B. Pusey. He proceeded MA in 1845, BD in 1850, and DD in 1872; he was ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1843, and settled down to the routine of a college don. He held the college offices in turn, made a very efficient bursar in his year of office, and was a successful tutor; the future Lord Salisbury was among his private pupils. Until 1871 he was precentor, with charge of the college choristers. He was a keen and capable musician, a devoted admirer of Handel, and a friend of John Hullah and other musicians. His fine collection of music was given in trust, after his death, by his sister, Eleanor Coates Tylden, to form the nucleus of a historical library of music in Oxford. During the vacations he occasionally visited Germany, where he studied music, but his home was with his father in Kent.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1871 Bellamy was elected president of his college, a position he held for over thirty years. Leader of the Conservative Party in the university at a time when his former pupil and friend Lord Salisbury was university chancellor, he was appointed a member of the statutory commission chaired by Lord Selborne which was established in 1877 to draw up new statutes for the university and colleges. Bellamy, who was closely associated with E. B. Pusey in academic politics, attempted to preserve restrictions limiting college headships and fellowships to clergymen; his college resisted the commission's secularizing policy to the end, making an unsuccessful last-ditch stand before the universities' committee of the privy council in 1883. He was a member of the university's hebdomadal council from 1874 to 1907 and was vice-chancellor from 1886 to 1890 as successor to Benjamin Jowett, whom he had known from childhood but with whom he disagreed trenchantly on almost every subject.<br>
<br>During his presidency of St John's Bellamy embodied the college's conservative traditions, which he strove to uphold. Himself a convivial bachelor, he fortified the resistance to allowing married men to hold fellowships, most controversially in the case of Sidney Ball. Agricultural depression, which reduced estate revenues, threatened to undermine the college, forcing in 1888 a 22 per cent reduction in the emoluments of fellows and scholars: Bellamy, a wealthy man by inheritance, made good the deficiency to the undergraduate scholars from his own pocket. He did not attempt a &#145;modern&#146; style of headship, remaining a remote figure to undergraduates and, unlike many of his peers, he never preached in his college chapel. Nor did he publish any scholarly work. His reputation as a common-room raconteur and wit&#151;sometimes caustic&#151;overshadowed his shrewd administrative abilities: under him the college grew rapidly, its fortunes restored by the astute and far-sighted development of its property in north Oxford.<br>
<br>Bellamy maintained a long-standing association with the Merchant Taylors' Company, of which he received the honorary freedom in June 1894. From 1895 to 1907 he held the sinecure rectory of Leckford, Hampshire, paying the income into college funds. Until extreme old age he retained his powers: up to his ninetieth year he sang the service in the college chapel on stated days, in perfect tune and with remarkable power of voice. Failing health led him to resign the presidentship on 24 June 1909. He retired to Ingoldisthorpe Manor, Norfolk, the property which he had inherited from his uncle, and died there on 25 August 1909. He was buried in the churchyard adjoining his garden.<br>
