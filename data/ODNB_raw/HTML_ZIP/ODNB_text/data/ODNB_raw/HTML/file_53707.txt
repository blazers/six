<span class="headword">Bodley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1591), <span class="occ">religious radical and publisher</span>, was born in St Stephen's parish, Exeter, the son of the merchant John Bodley (<i>d</i>. 1527), of Exeter, and Alice Gale (<i>d</i>. 1558), of Dartmouth. About 1543 he married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1586), the daughter of the prominent merchant Robert Hone of Ottery St Mary. Bodley and his kin were some of the leading merchants of Exeter and, perhaps because of their trade links with Bristol, London, and other centres of religious radicalism, were at the forefront of the burgeoning protestant movement in that city, one of the few in the south-west in which protestantism found popular support in the first half of the sixteenth century. During the 1549 rebellion against Edward VI's new prayer book, Bodley and his stepfather, Thomas Prestwood, and brother-in-law John Periam provided the funds required to finance Lord John Russell's lifting of the siege of Exeter, and his eventual suppression of the revolt. It was probably also at this time that Bodley met Miles Coverdale, then chaplain to Lord Russell, who was to remain a close colleague during their various travels over the following several years.<br>
<br>The presence of Coverdale as bishop of Exeter from 1551 no doubt further encouraged Bodley in his support of the protestant cause, and to his own peril he maintained his activities even after the accession of Mary I. He appears to have been one of the few people in the south-west involved in Sir Peter Carew's abortive uprising in 1554, and the Exeter chronicler John Hooker recounts how Bodley and John Periam were the special targets of William Smith, mayor of Exeter in 1553&#150;4 and &#145;an enemy to all such as were known or suspected to be true professors of the gospel&#146;  (J. Hooker, commonplace book, Devon RO, book 51, fol. 350). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2759/', "Sir Thomas Bodley")</script> in his autobiography writes,<blockquote>my Father in the time of Queen Mary, being noted and knowne to be an enemy to Popery, was so cruelly threatened, and so narrowly observed, by those that maliced his Religion, that for the safeguard of himselfe and my Mother, who was wholly affected as my Father, he knew no way so secure, as to fly into Germany; where after a while he found meanes to call over my Mother, with all his children and family. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1&#150;2)</blockquote>Bodley probably left England in 1555 (it has been suggested with Coverdale) and settled first in the English colony in Wesel, subsequently moving on to Frankfurt. There he was of the party opposed to the use of the English prayer book, and eventually left for Geneva, arriving in that city in May 1557. He served as elder for the English congregation there from December 1557 until his return to England. In 1558 he was made a citizen of Geneva, and established a printing press to produce William Whittingham's and Miles Coverdale's English translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, known as the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Bodley provided the principal financial backing behind the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span> and, after returning to England in September 1559, he was granted on 8 January 1561 a licence from Elizabeth I to have sole rights of publishing and importing the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for a period of seven years. Editions of this <span class="roman">Bible</span> were produced and imported from Geneva, presumably under Bodley's licence, in 1560, 1562, and 1570. In 1565&#150;6 Bodley tried to have this licence renewed for a further twelve years, but appears to have dropped his suit, in objection to Archbishop Parker's condition that the bishops examine and approve of the translation and its strongly Calvinist marginal annotations.<br>
<br>According to Thomas Bodley, his father settled in London upon his return to England from exile, &#145;within the first [year] of the Queen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 3), and certainly by 1568 he was living at &#145;the Three Cranes&#146; in the London parish of St Michael Paternoster Royal, also the parish of his old friend Coverdale. Throughout this period in London he actively maintained his connections and involvement in the international Calvinist cause. He served as an elder in the French and Walloon refugee church in London from 1571, or perhaps earlier, until his death. In 1583&#150;4 he acted as the conduit through which money collected nationally for the relief of Geneva was directed to that city. Thomas Sampson, a leading puritan divine, relied on him to bear his letters to Burleigh and other officials, and to act as his spokesman before them. He was closely aligned with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70079/', "Culverwell family")</script>, another Devon family who were principal figures among the &#145;godly&#146; in Elizabethan London. He was an overseer for the wills of the brothers Nicholas and Richard Culverwell; an executor for Nicholas's widow, Elizabeth; and in his own will gave generous privileges to his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70076/', "Anthony Culverwell")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70079/', "Culverwell family (per. c.1545&#150;c.1640)")</script>], nephew of Richard and Nicholas, who had married Bodley's daughter Sybil in 1582. Moreover he was a patron and protector of the artist Nicholas Hilliard, also from Exeter, who as a youth had been part of his household in Geneva.<br>
<br>Bodley was also a prominent merchant in London. He was a freeman of the Drapers' Company from 1575, a merchant adventurer, and a founding member of the Eastland Company. Through trade, and perhaps secondarily through publishing, he was very wealthy, assessed at &pound;160 for the 1577 lay subsidy and able to contribute &pound;200 for the defence of London during the Armada scare of 1588. In his will of 7 July 1591 he left small charitable bequests to the poor in his parish, in the French church, and in the hospitals and prisons of London, but gave the bulk of his large fortune (his bequests amounted to &pound;2425) to his numerous children: &pound;1000 to his eldest son, Thomas, &pound;500 and his house at Three Cranes to another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2757/', "Sir Josias Bodley")</script>, and &pound;100 to each of his other children&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2758/', "Laurence Bodley")</script> and Miles Bodley, and his married daughters Prothesia (Prothesy) Bogan, Alice Helman, Sybil Culverwell, Elizabeth Willis, and Susan Shute. John Bodley died shortly after making this will, and was buried on 14 October 1591 in the parish of St Michael Paternoster Royal.<br>
