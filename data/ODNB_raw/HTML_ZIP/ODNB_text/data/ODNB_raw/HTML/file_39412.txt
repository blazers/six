<span class="headword">Thurtle <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lansbury]</span>,  Dorothy</span>  (1890&#150;1973), <span class="occ">campaigner for contraceptive and abortion rights</span>, was born at 105 St Stephen's Road, Bow, east London, on 15 November 1890, the sixth child of the eight daughters and four sons of the working-class Labour politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34407/', "George Lansbury (1859&#150;1940)")</script>, who at the time of her birth was recorded as being employed as a journeyman veneer dryer, and his wife, Elisabeth Jane (Bessie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brine (<i>d</i>. 1933). Two of her siblings died in infancy. Like the other Lansbury children she was educated at an east London elementary school and grew up in a hothouse of <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> radical and working-class politics. She joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) at the age of sixteen and shortly after, employed as a clerk and an accountant, joined the National Union of Clerks. A member of the Women's Freedom League and the Women's Labour League, she was exasperated by the militant tactics of the suffragette movement, a position that caused some friction within her family, particularly with her brother William Lansbury, who was imprisoned in 1913 for window-breaking in support of the Women's Social and Political Union. Taking a position that would characterize her later work on abortion reform, she believed that political energies were better expended on working-class issues.<br>
<br>Through her union activity Dorothy Lansbury met <a href="#cosubject_39412">Ernest Thurtle [<i>see below</i>]</a>; she travelled to the USA, where he was working, and they married in Philadelphia on 13 August 1912. After returning to England early in 1914 they had a son, Peter, and a daughter, Helen. The Thurtles were political collaborators, co-authors of <span class="italic">Comradeship for Clerks</span> (1913). Dorothy pursued a career in local politics in Shoreditch, the constituency which Ernest represented in parliament. General secretary of Shoreditch Trades Council and Labour Party, she was elected to Shoreditch borough council in 1925 and became mayor in 1936. Both she and Ernest positioned themselves on the left of Labour politics between the wars.<br>
<br>The Thurtles were founding members of the Workers' Birth Control Group (WBCG) in 1924. This was an attempt to get the Labour Party to commit itself formally to the extension of working women's access to birth control information. In 1926 Ernest Thurtle presented an unsuccessful parliamentary bill to this end. For her part, Dorothy was a leading advocate of the cause within the Labour Party women's sections. She became deeply frustrated by the party's intransigence on the issue, arguing that it showed Labour's indifference to women's rights and made nonsense of the party's professed commitment to sex equality. In a memorable attack she said in 1926 that the party's leaders &#145;only have use for women so long as they have no opinions of their own but are willing to do the donkey work of the Party&#146; (&#145;Mrs Thurtle's protest&#146;, <span class="italic">New Generation</span>, April 1926, 40, quoted in S. Rowsbotham, <span class="italic">A New World for Women: Stella Browne Socialist&#150;Feminist</span>, 1977, 35). The birth control campaign was a practical education in feminism for Thurtle, a lesson that stayed with her throughout her career. In 1945, for example, she compared women's position to that of slavery and spoke of them as an &#145;oppressed class&#146;  (D. Thurtle, &#145;Women: an oppressed class?&#146;, <span class="italic">Labour Woman</span> 33/6, June 1945, 115).<br>
<br>Like such other veterans of the WBCG as Alice Jenkins and Janet Chance, Dorothy Thurtle took up the cause of legal abortion in the 1930s. She was one of the first members of the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA) in 1936, serving as a vice-president until her retirement in 1962. Unlike other members of the ALRA, who tended to be Labour by covert sympathy rather than formal affiliation, Thurtle was a recognized local politician. Her greatest contribution to the cause of abortion rights was in her capacity as a member of the official interdepartmental committee on abortion, which sat under the chairmanship of Sir Norman Birkett between 1937 and 1939. The interdepartmental committee heard evidence from a wide variety of groups, including the medical profession, midwives, Labour women's sections, and the ALRA. Thurtle was the only unequivocal supporter within the committee of a radical revision of the law. When it published a final report recommending no major change in the law, Thurtle publicly dissented, issuing a minority report. In this she proposed that abortion be made legal in a number of circumstances on social grounds, particularly for women with high fertility rates. Thurtle was particularly sympathetic to the plight of working-class women &#145;at the mercy of their own fertility&#146;  (TNA: PRO, Ministry of Health MH71/30, Ministry of Health and Home Office, report of the interdepartmental committee on abortion, 1939, minority report). Though she had strong feminist leanings, her support for abortion was based as much on a concern for social justice between classes as for reproductive rights. What offended Thurtle was the inequality between the classes over access to abortion. She wrote in <span class="italic">Abortion: Right or Wrong?</span> (1940): &#145;there is one practice for the well-to-do and another for the poor. Social justice demands equal facilities and treatment in this matter&#146;  (p. 27). This also sprang from her personal and political roots in the East End of London, and illustrates how working-class politics, socialism, and feminism could be wound together by abortion law reform.<br>
<br>Thurtle remained active in the ALRA through the 1950s and early 1960s. She was also involved with the National Birth Control Council, which became the Family Planning Association, but retired from political work in 1962, when there was a generational changing of the guard within the ALRA. She lived to see the passing of the 1967 <span class="roman">Abortion Act</span>, a reform for which she had long worked. She died at Napsbury Hospital, St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 28 February 1973.<br>
<br>Dorothy Thurtle's husband, <a name="cosubject_39412"></a><span class="headword">Ernest Thurtle</span>  (1884&#150;1954), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Port Jervis, New York state, USA, on 11 November 1884, the second son of the three sons and two daughters of Philip Thurtle (<i>d</i>. 1890), a trainer of sporting dogs, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1912). His parents were British and, when he was two, they settled at Alfrick, Worcestershire. When his father died his mother moved to Griffithstown, near Pontypool, in Monmouthshire, supporting the family by running a general store and taking in sewing. After elementary schooling at Alfrick and Griffithstown, he found work in the weighing machine office of the steelworks of Alfred Baldwin Ltd, and became involved in Labour politics, joining the ILP about 1907. After moving to London he became chairman of the London district council of the National Union of Clerks, and obtained employment as a salesman for an asphalt company, which took him to Belgium and North America. During the First World War he enlisted in the London regiment, served on the western front, was commissioned in 1917, and was seriously wounded at Cambrai.<br>
<br>Ernest Thurtle returned to civilian life determined to follow a political career, and stood unsuccessfully as the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers parliamentary candidate for Bethnal Green South-West at the general election of 1918. He represented former servicemen on the United Services Fund, which distributed aid. Defeated again in 1922, he was elected as Labour MP for Shoreditch in 1923. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the minister of pensions in 1924 and took the same role when his father-in-law was commissioner of works in 1929. He became a junior lord of the Treasury between 1930 and 1931. He lost his seat in the National Government's landslide of 1931, and worked as a brewers' representative, but returned to the Commons in 1935, representing Shoreditch (and, after 1950, Shoreditch and Finsbury) until his death. From 1941 to 1945 he was parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Information.<br>
<br>Ernest Thurtle's greatest contribution to political life came early in his career. Appalled by the cruelty of military punishment during his time in the trenches, he spearheaded a campaign to abolish the death penalty for offences such as desertion and cowardice, also publishing two books on the question, <span class="italic">Military Discipline and Democracy</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">Shootings at Dawn</span> (1929). In 1924 he introduced a bill to abolish the death penalty in such cases, and achieved his aim in 1930, a considerable personal triumph that did much to humanize military justice in Britain. His anti-militarism in the early 1920s was also expressed in criticisms of the armistice day remembrance ceremonial and opposition to armed forces recruitment. A supporter of the League Against Imperialism, he visited India in 1928 and met Gandhi. In 1945 he published an autobiography, which omitted reference to many of the political positions which he had taken in the 1920s. He died at the Horton Hospital, Epsom, Surrey, on 22 August 1954.<br>
