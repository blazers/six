<span class="headword">Mirsky, Dmitry Svyatopolk</span>  (1890&#150;1939), <span class="occ">Russian scholar</span>, was born on 9 September (28 August <span class="smallcap">OS</span>) 1890 on his father's country estate at Gievka, near Kharkov, Ukraine, the second of the four children and eldest son of Prince Pyotr Dmitryevich Svyatopolk-Mirsky (1857&#150;1914), army officer and civil servant, and his wife, Countess Yekaterina Alekseyevna Bobrinskaya (1864&#150;1926), the daughter of Count Aleksey Alekseyevich Bobrinsky of Tula. On the father's side the Svyatopolk-Mirskys claimed descent from Ryurik, the founder of the Russian state, and the mother's side was descended from the illegitimate son of Catherine the Great and Grigory Orlov. Prince P. D. Svyatopolk-Mirsky rose to become minister of the interior for five months in 1904&#150;5; he stepped down after the events of &#145;bloody Sunday&#146;, 9 January 1905, and lived out his life in retirement. Dmitry was tutored at home until the age of fourteen, an especially valued mentor being his English nanny, Miss Trend, the sister of J. B. Trend, who became professor of Spanish at Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Mirsky then attended the imperial <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> in Moscow for two years, and for a further two years from 1906 the &eacute;lite Tenishev Gymnasium in St Petersburg. From 1908 to 1911 he studied oriental languages at the University of St Petersburg, then served for two years as an officer in the imperial guards rifle regiment. He went back to the University of St Petersburg and graduated in classics in 1914. His poems and critical articles first appeared in a school publication in 1906, and he brought out a collection of poetry in 1911. He rejoined his regiment on the outbreak of the First World War and served on the German front for two years, and then in the Caucasus. He was wounded in 1916 and during convalescence married a nurse named Flevinova, but never saw her again after he left the hospital; the marriage ended in divorce. Just before the February revolution of 1917 Mirsky passed out from the Academy of the Imperial General Staff, and was posted to Armenia. In June 1918 Mirsky made his way back to Gievka, studied briefly at the University of Kharkov, and in December fled with his family to the Crimea. In March 1919 he joined the White Army of General Denikin, and served with the rank of captain as adjutant in various regiments, emigrating via Poland to Athens when this army was defeated in 1920.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1921 Mirsky went to London at the invitation of Maurice Baring, who had known his family in Russia. Sir Bernard Pares, who also knew Mirsky's family, appointed him as lecturer in Russian at the School of Slavonic Studies, King's College, University of London, in May 1922. In emigration, Mirsky preferred not to use his title of prince, and simplified his name to D. S. Mirsky. People who knew him well in England remembered particularly his phenomenal verbal memory, his astonishingly fluent command of English, French, and German, and his imposing stature, with black beard, bald head, and oriental eyes. Besides carrying out his teaching duties in London, where his pupils included the future Professor Dame Elizabeth Hill, Mirsky was active in British and French literary circles, and was personally acquainted with, among others, T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, Jane Ellen Harrison, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and Andr&eacute; Gide. Among his closest associates in the Russian literary emigration was the poet Marina Tsvetaeva; he brought her to London to give a reading in March 1926.<br>
<br>Mirsky was the first critic in Russian or English to appreciate and write about the significance of all four of the great Russian poets of his generation: Akhmatova, Mandelshtam, Pasternak, and Tsvetaeva. He also pioneered the serious discussion of Babel, Pilnyak, and many other important Russian writers. His most important work, which he wrote in English, was published in two volumes, <span class="italic">Contemporary Russian Literature</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">A History of Russian Literature from the Earliest Times to the Death of Dostoevsky, 1881</span> (1927). These volumes were condensed by Francis J. Whitfield into the standard <span class="italic">A History of Russian Literature</span> (1949). During his time in London, Mirsky published six books and about 150 articles in English on Russian literature, culture, and history.<br>
<br>Mirsky also played an important part in the intellectual and political life of the Russian emigration as a prominent figure in the Eurasian movement, which was subsidized by the English philanthropist H. N. Spalding. Mirsky's political evolution was shaped by his observing the social and political conditions in Britain, continental Europe, and the United States in the period beginning with the general strike of 1926, and was particularly influenced negatively by the rise of fascism, and positively by the five-year plans and collectivization of agriculture that began in the USSR under Stalin in 1929. The evolution of Mirsky's political views was attested in his <span class="italic">Russia: a Social History</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Lenin</span> (1931), and &#145;Why I became a Marxist&#146; (<span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, 30 June 1931). His actions were also affected by his relationship with Vera Suvchinskaya 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Guchkova; 1906&#150;87)
  , who in 1930 refused to marry him and live in London.<br>
<br>In June 1931 Mirsky joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. His work for the party included a celebrated speech on dialectical materialism to the Heretics at Cambridge University. In the autumn of 1931 he applied simultaneously for Soviet and British citizenship, taking the Soviet because it arrived first. His relations with Sir Bernard Pares became acrimonious, and he resigned from his post at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in March 1932. In September he went back to Russia. Often referred to privately as &#145;Comrade Prince&#146; Mirsky, he then began a tumultuous career as a Soviet literary critic. In his first year in Moscow he was friendly with the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> correspondent, Malcolm Muggeridge, and in the summer of 1935 he came to know Edmund Wilson. Mirsky published a scathing valedictory book drawing on his <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> years, which was translated into English as <span class="italic">The Intelligentsia of Great Britain</span> (1935). He was arrested on 3 June 1937 during Stalin's great purge, found guilty of &#145;suspected espionage&#146;, and sentenced to eight years' correctional labour. He was transported to Siberia, put to work on tree felling, rapidly became ill with dysentery and frost-bite, and died in the labour camp Invalidnaya Hospital near Magadan on 6 June 1939. He was buried at Invalidnaya the following day.<br>
<br>An underlying logic and sense of purpose may be discerned beneath the vicissitudes of Mirsky's life and thought: he remained rooted in the aristocratic service mentality of his forebears, but was driven by a personal need for commitment to some force that would overcome the degeneration he eventually diagnosed in the social milieu into which he was born. As the author of <span class="italic">A History of Russian Literature</span> Mirsky can claim to be one of the most important single mediators between the Russian- and English-speaking literary worlds. His restless mind and impulsive temperament compelled him to deal with the fateful choices facing the Russian men of his generation in an extraordinarily dramatic and instructive way.<br>
