<span class="headword">Carter,  Henry</span>  (1874&#150;1951), <span class="occ">temperance campaigner and pacifist</span>, was born on 3 November 1874 at 17 Cornwall Street, Plymouth, the son of George Henry Richards Carter, a basket-maker, and his wife, Lavinia Johns Kingdon. His father died when Henry Carter was young, so he was brought up by his mother, a devout Methodist and committed teetotaller. At the age of fourteen Carter left school and moved to Cardiff, where he first was apprenticed in an ironmongers' firm and later worked for various wholesale provision merchants, eventually selling on the road. In 1898&#150;1901 he studied at Handsworth College, Birmingham, a Wesleyan Methodist divinity school, and in 1905 he was ordained as a minister. On 5 August 1905 he married Sarah Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1869/70), daughter of John Rumbelow a machinist. They had a daughter.<br>
<br>Carter found his life work in 1911 when he was appointed secretary of the temperance committee of the Wesleyan Methodist church. In 1918 this office was expanded to include social welfare. After the merger of the Methodist churches in Britain in 1932 he continued as secretary of the temperance and social welfare committee for the unified Methodist church until his retirement in 1942. As a temperance reformer his watchwords were &#145;Elevate! Educate! Legislate!&#146; In 1912 he founded the Wesleyan Methodist League of Abstainers. In 1915 he became honorary secretary of the new Temperance Council of the Christian Churches of England and Wales, and in 1916&#150;21 he served as a member of the central control board (liquor traffic). Carter published a respected history of the board's experiment in state management, <span class="italic">The Control of the Drink Trade: a Contribution to National Efficiency</span> (1918; 2nd edn, 1919). His conversion to state purchase of the alcoholic drink trade offended many prohibitionists, however, as did his support for the compromise licensing act of 1921 which sharply reduced the hours of sale from those which had existed before the war.<br>
<br>In 1919, during a visit to the United States to study national prohibition, Carter became a member of the general council of the new World League against Alcoholism. In 1929&#150;31 he served on the royal commission on liquor licensing laws: he signed the majority report, but with reservations. In its support he published a booklet, <span class="italic">The Nation Surveys the Drink Problem</span> (1932) and also signed what was called the nine-point programme, published in the <span class="italic">Christian World</span> (11 February 1932). In the same year, frustrated with what he considered the impractical rigidity of the prohibitionist United Kingdom Alliance, he published the first, nineteenth-century volume of <span class="italic">The English Temperance Movement: a Study in Objectives</span>. Prohibitionists were furious, and, having made his point in defence of moral suasion, Carter decided that it was unnecessarily provocative to write the second volume, on the twentieth century. In 1933, after the unification of the Wesleyan Methodists with the other Methodist churches, some of them committed to prohibition, Carter signed a conciliatory &#145;agreed temperance programme&#146;, along with representatives of the United Kingdom Alliance. He was opposed to gambling as well as to drinking, and wrote <span class="italic">Facts about Greyhound Racing</span> (1928) in support of the National Emergency Committee of Christian Citizens, which advocated a local option for the opening of dog tracks.<br>
<br>Carter's concern for world peace and justice led him to pacifism and to work on behalf of refugees: he announced his commitment to Christian pacifism in an article in the <span class="italic">Methodist Recorder</span> (23 March 1933). Carter later helped found the Methodist Peace Fellowship and chaired the National Peace Council. He also was a vigorous opponent of antisemitism. Shortly after the creation in 1938 of the Christian Council for Refugees he became chairman of the board of management. From 1948 until his death he served as chairman of the council. In 1945 he was chosen as chairman too of the Ecumenical Refugee Commission under the auspices of what became the World Council of Churches. Carter later helped form the European Refugee Commission and the Methodist Refugee Fund. He also chaired the executive of the Council of Christians and Jews. In 1950 he published <span class="italic">The Refugee Problem in Europe and the Middle East</span>.<br>
<br>Carter's humanitarian passions were rooted in his evangelical religiosity. His busy schedule did not intrude upon his &#145;regular, systematic and intense habit of private devotion&#146;  (Urwin, 125). His books on Methodism, beginning with <span class="italic">The Church and the New Age</span> (1911) and ending with <span class="italic">The Methodist Heritage</span> (1951), extended across virtually his entire life as an ordained minister.<br>
<br>Much of what is known about Carter the man comes from a memoir published by Evelyn Clifford Urwin in 1955. Urwin had access to Carter's diaries and correspondence, interviewed friends, relatives, and staff members, and himself had worked with Carter from 1933. Urwin admiringly recalled Carter's energy, his organizational ability, his gift for winning the loyalty of his staff, and &#145;his almost boyish boisterous laugh&#146;  (Urwin, 120). Although Carter was a prolific writer, &#145;writing did not come easily to him&#146;  (ibid., 103). He spoke little about himself and kept his family life intensely private. His wife's health was fragile and their daughter predeceased them. He irritated critics with what they derided as &#145;Henry Carter's stunts&#146;  (ibid., 122) and suffered from &#145;a tiny streak of vanity and pleasure in success and esteem&#146;  (ibid., 126). He won the admiration of many people prominent in public life. In recognition of his public services he was made CBE in 1934. Carter died from heart failure on 19 June 1951 at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Marylebone, London, and was buried in Cardiff. His wife survived him.<br>
