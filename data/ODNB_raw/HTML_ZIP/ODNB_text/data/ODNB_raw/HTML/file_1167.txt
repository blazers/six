<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;1758), <span class="occ">college head</span>, is of uncertain origins. The matriculation register of Trinity College, Dublin, recorded that he entered the college on 29 April 1684, at the age of seventeen, had been born in Athy, in co. Carlow (though Athy is in co. Kildare), the son of Richard Baldwin of Athy, and that he had attended Kilkenny College under the care of the Revd Dr Edward Hinton. Much to the puzzlement of his colleagues Baldwin never discussed his background. Dr John Lawson, professor of oratory and history at the college, who gave the oration at Baldwin's funeral, enlightened those in attendance by stating that Baldwin had in fact been born in England and brought to Ireland in his infancy. Lawson's revelation was supported by an account in a local history of Colne, Lancashire:<blockquote>Richard Baldwen the son of James Baldwen, of Parke Hill, near Colne, born AD 1672, and educated at the grammar school of that place, where he is said to have given a mortal blow to a school fellow, upon which he fled to Ireland, and was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, where in 1717 he became provost. (Whitaker, 2.519)</blockquote>A more detailed retelling of this account, by a Mr Adamson, which was prepared in connection with a subsequent legal challenge to Baldwin's will, was included in Taylor's <span class="italic">History of the University of Dublin</span>. The baptismal register of St Bartholomew's in Colne records that Richard Baldwen, son of James Baldwen of Park Hill, Barrowford, Colne, was baptized on 14 April 1672, but the dates are inconsistent, since if this was the record of Baldwin's birth he would have been only twelve on entry to Trinity. Another variation of Baldwin's background appeared in a letter to the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in July 1892 from J. R. Baldwin, who claimed that Baldwin had been the son of a James Baldwin from Ingthorpe Grange, Skipton, Yorkshire, and that the incident in which he supposedly killed a fellow pupil had occurred at Sedbergh School and had involved a cricket ball.<br>
<br>The real circumstances behind Baldwin's arrival in Ireland remain unclear, but his attendance at Kilkenny College can be confirmed by the college register, which records that he left the school to enter Trinity College in 1685. His entry into Kilkenny College was not recorded, since he arrived before the granting of a charter and statutes to the college by James, first duke of Ormond, in March 1685, which required that a register be taken when boys were &#145;admitted into the said School &hellip; as also the time of their departure&#146;  (Macalister, item 18). Although Baldwin is recorded as having matriculated a year earlier than when he was supposed to have left Kilkenny the date noted for matriculation was not always the date from which attendance at university began. The dramatist William Congreve was also a pupil at Kilkenny during this time. Baldwin was elected as a scholar of Trinity College in 1686 and commenced with a BA in early 1689.<br>
<br>After the Jacobite occupation of Trinity in 1689 Baldwin fled to England and possibly took up a teaching position in Chester. His experiences during this time made a deep impression and contributed to his becoming an avowed whig and constant opponent of the tories within and without the college for the rest of his life. Samuel Burdy's biography of the Revd Philip Skelton, of 1792, contained a number of anecdotes concerning Baldwin's battle with Jacobite sympathizers, including his supposed comment about his tory antithesis, Jonathan Swift, whom he judged &#145;remarkable for nothing else while a student than his skill in kindling a good fire&#146;  (Burdy, 33). Baldwin was elected fellow of Trinity in 1693, became senior fellow in 1697, vice-provost in 1713, and provost in 1717. The speed of his elevation to high office has caused some historians to speculate that whig forces outside the college led to Baldwin's &#145;being preferred to men more highly gifted&#146;  (Taylor, 250) than himself; this is supported by the fact that his selection as provost coincided with the Hanoverian succession. His manner of leadership has been described as autocratic and he himself &#145;a forerunner of the more severe type of Victorian head-master, with sound but unimaginative scholarship and an insistence on hard work and the observance of a strict disciplinary code&#146;, but behind Dublin's Georgian fa&ccedil;ade was a culture of &#145;riots and drunken brawls among half-educated would-be gentlemen&#146;  (McDowell and Webb, 38) to which students were easily attracted. Baldwin made significant progress in improving student behaviour, however; Swift, in a letter to the earl of Peterborough in April 1726, described Trinity as a place where &#145;youths are instructed with much stricter discipline than either Oxford or Cambridge&#146;  (Williams, 3.133). Two of the college's finest buildings, the printing house (1734) and the library (1732), were completed during his provostship.<br>
<br>Baldwin died in Trinity on 30 September 1758, reputedly at the age of ninety-two, having completed forty-one years as provost, the longest tenure of any before or since; he was buried in the college chapel on 4 October. He left the college his entire fortune of &pound;24,000 and 200,000 acres in real estate located in several counties in Ireland. His will was disputed by certain persons in England who claimed to be his relatives citing the evidence that suggested that Baldwin had been born in Colne. Litigation continued intermittently for sixty-two years before the case was decided in favour of the college in 1820. There is a large, sculpted monument to Baldwin by Christopher Hewetson in the public theatre of the college.<br>
