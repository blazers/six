<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pole,  Michael  de la</span>, first earl of Suffolk  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1389), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22460/', "Sir William de la Pole (d. 1366)")</script> of Kingston upon Hull and his wife, Katherine. He was born before, though probably not long before, 1330. Although his father had enjoyed a remarkable career as a merchant and financier to the crown, much of his fortune had ultimately been lost as a result of a succession of lawsuits with the king. Most of what survived was held jointly with his wife, who did not die until January 1382. Thus when William died in 1366 Michael inherited little beyond an annuity of 400 marks (&pound;266 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.).<h2>
<a name="Marriageandmilitaryservice"></a>Marriage and military service</h2>As a young man de la Pole moved away from the mercantile circle into which he had been born, and made a military career for himself. He had been knighted by 1353, and served with Henry, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1361), in 1355. He also established links with Edward, the Black Prince, and campaigned with him in 1359. By January 1366 he had attained the rank of banneret and was summoned to parliament by individual writ, an honour that had eluded his father, who had sat in the Commons as MP for Kingston upon Hull.<br>
<br>The Black Prince's patronage may have helped to bring about de la Pole's marriage <i>c</i>.1358 to Katherine (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1349, <i>d</i>. 1385), daughter of Sir John Wingfield of Wingfield, Suffolk. Sir John was one of the Black Prince's retainers and a member of his council. Katherine, his only child, was heir to an estate in East Anglia that included several manors in the honour of Eye. Much of it remained in the hands of her mother, Eleanor, until the latter's death in 1375, but de la Pole's future as a landowner lay in East Anglia, and in 1384 he received licence to crenellate Wingfield Castle, the centre of his wife's inheritance.<br>
<br>When the war with France was resumed in 1369, de la Pole appears to have transferred his allegiance to John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and he received a fee from him every year from 1369 to 1382. He took part with the Black Prince in the siege and sack of Limoges in 1370, and remained in Gascony with Gaunt after the Black Prince returned home, an invalid, at the conclusion of the siege. He was with Gaunt on his long march from Calais to Bordeaux in 1373, and his appointment as admiral north of the Thames in November 1376 may have owed something to Gaunt's influence. His military reputation was well established, though his career had not been without its set-backs. He had twice been captured and imprisoned, and presumably ransomed, though nothing is known about the circumstances in either case.<h2>
<a name="Royalservantandchancellor"></a>Royal servant and chancellor</h2>De la Pole's connections with Edward III's two most influential sons perhaps explain his rapid rise at the court of the Black Prince's son, Richard II, after 1377. He served at sea with Edward III's youngest son, Thomas of Woodstock, over the winter of 1377&#150;8, and with Gaunt on the St Malo expedition later in 1378, but he was now approaching the age of fifty, and his service to the crown henceforth was to be largely of a civilian nature. In the spring of 1379 he was appointed as one of the ambassadors to negotiate the king's marriage. He went first to Milan, where inconclusive discussions were held about the possibility of Richard marrying Caterina Visconti, and then to Germany, where negotiations took place with Wenceslas, king of the Romans, following a proposal, which may have emanated from the pope, that Richard should marry Wenceslas's sister Anne. On the way from Italy to Germany de la Pole and his companions were held captive by brigands and Richard had to send one of his heralds to negotiate their release. They arrived back in England on 20 May 1380. His mission no doubt raised his status in Richard's eyes, but he was not yet completely identified with the court: in the parliament of November 1381 he was appointed, together with the earl of Arundel, to &#145;advise and govern the person of the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.104). It is not clear what, if anything, he accomplished in this capacity, but it probably brought him closer to the king.<br>
<br>In 1383 de la Pole's career began a rapid rise. The chancellor, Robert Braybrook, bishop of London, resigned on 10 March and after a brief interval Richard appointed Michael de la Pole to succeed him. The appointment does not appear to have been controversial: it is important not to read back to 1383 the hostility manifested towards him in 1386, which arose from his conduct as chancellor rather than his appointment.<br>
<br>In explaining the growth of this hostility, foreign policy is probably the key issue. It has been argued that with de la Pole's appointment as chancellor the pursuit of peace with France &#145;may be said to have become the cardinal feature of English foreign policy&#146;  (Palmer, <span class="italic">England, France and Christendom</span>, 44). In seeking peace de la Pole almost certainly had the full support of the king. The Commons in parliament were reluctant to grant the necessary taxes to finance the war, and in military terms the French had regained the initiative in the Low Countries. There seemed little point in trying to reassert English influence there with inadequate financial resources.<h2>
<a name="Peaceandwar"></a>Peace and war</h2>According to Walsingham, de la Pole attempted unsuccessfully to abort the planned &#145;crusade&#146; to Flanders led by the bishop of Norwich which was intended to counter Franco-Burgundian influence there. The disastrous outcome of the &#145;crusade&#146;, however, played into de la Pole's hands, and on 8 September 1383 John of Gaunt and Thomas of Woodstock were appointed to negotiate peace with France. A truce was agreed on 26 January 1384, but, following a debate in the Salisbury parliament of April that year, all that was accomplished was a prolongation of the truce until May 1385, by which time the increased belligerence of the French and their Scottish allies rendered any possibility of a negotiated peace very remote.<br>
<br>Although a strong case could be made on financial grounds for a peace settlement, the political community had not been convinced that de la Pole's proposed terms were in the crown's interests, and his failure afterwards to send military support to Ghent, the last Flemish town to hold out against Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, enabled Philip to consolidate his authority in Flanders and bring the county into the war against England. The collapse of English influence in Flanders was in itself enough to explain de la Pole's growing unpopularity: his attempt to negotiate peace had produced nothing but disadvantages for England.<br>
<br>There can be little doubt, however, that de la Pole had pursued his peace policy with the full support of the king, and despite his failure to secure a lasting settlement he was well rewarded for his efforts. In the summer of 1385 he brought a retinue of sixty men-at-arms and eighty archers to serve on the king's expedition to Scotland. De la Pole was now at least fifty-five years of age, and this was to prove his last campaign. He saw no serious fighting, but &#145;at Hoselaw in Teviotdale&#146; on 6 August  (<span class="italic">Reports from the Lords' Committees &hellip; Touching the Dignity of a Peer</span>, 5 vols., 1820&#150;29, 5.69) Richard conferred on him the title of earl of Suffolk, and shortly afterwards granted him lands to the value of &pound;500 from the inheritance of the last Ufford earl of Suffolk, which had escheated to the crown in 1382. Virtually all the lands were in the hands of the queen and Ufford's widow for their lives, however, and for the time being his income had to be secured on other sources.<br>
<br>The parliament of October 1385 confirmed the king's grant of the earldom of Suffolk to de la Pole, but at the same time it was critical of the king's&#151;and by implication de la Pole's&#151;handling of finance. The truce of 1383&#150;5 had not brought about any significant improvement in royal finances, and de la Pole had attempted to finance the Scottish expedition by reviving the obsolete feudal levy of scutage. When parliament met in October, the Commons attributed the government's financial embarrassment to the king's extravagance, and insisted on a series of reforms in return for a grant of taxation. However, the reforms proved ineffective (for which the Commons were later to blame Suffolk), and over the following year the financial crisis deepened further. The threat of a French invasion necessitated expenditure on coastal defence in south-east England, and by October 1386 the government had no alternative but to summon parliament, the so-called Wonderful Parliament, and seek a tax. The tax that Suffolk now requested from the Commons, however, was unprecedentedly high: he asked for four fifteenths and tenths, all to be paid within one year. This provoked a political crisis which led to Suffolk's downfall.<h2>
<a name="Impeachmentfailingsinoffice"></a>Impeachment: failings in office</h2>The Commons demanded the dismissal and impeachment of the chancellor before they would agree to consider any other business, while Richard for his part refused to meet parliament, saying, according to Knighton, that he would not dismiss even a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Under the scarcely veiled threat of deposition, the king gave way. Suffolk was dismissed from the chancery, and the Commons proceeded to impeach him on seven charges, all of which related to his conduct as chancellor.<br>
<br>J. S. Roskell has analysed the charges under two broad headings, those that accused him of failing in his duties as chancellor, and those that accused him of misusing his office to obtain personal benefits. Three of the four charges relating to his failings in office were substantial, and modern scholarship has established that there was a case to answer on each of them. He was accused of failing to implement the ordinance for financial reform agreed in the previous parliament, of failing to ensure that the tax granted in the previous parliament had been spent in the way parliament had authorized, thus jeopardizing the safe keeping of the seas, and of failing to send military help to the rebels in Ghent, so that the town was lost to the Burgundians.<br>
<br>Suffolk was able to show, in respect of the first charge, that some attempt at economy had been made, mainly by savings on the cost of the garrisons of Cherbourg and Brest, but he was unable to offer any other examples, and the implication of his defence was that he had indeed failed to achieve savings elsewhere. It was also true that at least &pound;5000 of the tax revenue raised under the terms of the parliamentary grant in October 1385 had not been spent on the navy, as parliament had required. As far as Ghent was concerned, parliament in 1385 had authorized the government to borrow 10,000 marks (&pound;6666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) to finance a military expedition in support of the rebels holding out in the town against the duke of Burgundy. Most of the money was indeed spent on a force for that purpose, but by the time it was mustered it was too late and the rebels had submitted to the duke. Thus the charge against Suffolk was true in essentials, though the force was diverted to reinforce the garrison of Berwick against the threat from Scotland after the expiry of the truce.<br>
<br>Although there was substance to all three charges, Suffolk successfully argued that he was not solely responsible, and that the negligence of which the Commons complained was the fault of the government as a whole, not just the chancellor. The Lords' judgment was that Suffolk should not be found guilty alone, without the others who had been members of the council at the time. The final charge in this group, that Suffolk had improperly granted charters of pardons for felonies and had sold justice, was perhaps less significant. He did not try to defend himself seriously against the charge, and it is unlikely that he was doing anything that would have seemed unacceptable to his predecessors in office. In the judgment against him it was merely declared that any illegal grants should be revoked.<h2>
<a name="Impeachmentpersonalmisdemeanours"></a>Impeachment: personal misdemeanours</h2>The charges in the second group, which dealt with Suffolk's supposed personal benefits from office, are by their nature more difficult to substantiate. He was accused of purchasing lands for less than they were worth, and it was implied that he had not been worthy of the substantial inheritance conferred upon him when he was created earl of Suffolk. He defended himself by reminding his accusers of his military and diplomatic career. His brother-in-law, Richard, Lord Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1403), himself a former chancellor, added that Suffolk had served as a banneret for upwards of thirty years &#145;without dishonour or reproach&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.217), and had been sufficiently well endowed to maintain the estate nearest to that of an earl. Suffolk went on to argue that many of the lands granted to him were in the hands of others for their lives: the real benefit to him of the grants was much less than the Commons believed. None the less, he was found guilty of misusing his position as chancellor to further his own interests, and he was sentenced to forfeiture of all the lands he had received by royal grant, though he was allowed to retain his title as earl of Suffolk. The other two articles referred to specific issues. He was accused of misappropriating an annuity of &pound;50 granted by Edward III to Tideman Lemberg (<i>d</i>. 1386) and subsequently forfeited to the crown, and of procuring for himself the income in England of the order of St Antoine de Vienne, confiscated by the crown during the papal schism. In all probability Suffolk was guilty on both counts; certainly the Lords found him so, and he was required to forfeit all his income from both sources.<br>
<br>Thus there was substance to most of the major charges against Suffolk, and in addition to the sentences imposed in respect of specific charges he was sentenced to be imprisoned until he paid a fine, which Walsingham said amounted to 20,000 marks (&pound;13,333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.). In impeaching him, however, the Commons were not just attacking him personally, but also expressing their lack of confidence in the government and in particular their suspicions about the integrity of the royal financial administration. On the other hand Suffolk was more than a mere scapegoat: he had been deeply involved in royal finance and diplomacy, yet, as he argued, others were responsible as well as he for the mistakes and negligence that formed the basis of the charges against him.<br>
<br>According to the <span class="italic">Eulogium historiarum sive temporis</span> parliament ordered Suffolk to be confined within Corfe Castle, but if this is true it proved to be a very brief period of imprisonment. The king remitted the penalty and by Christmas he was free again and joined the king at Windsor. In 1387 he accompanied the king on his progress round England. He seems to have taken an aggressive stance in defence of the king's rights, and his opponents believed that he encouraged the king to defy the commission of government imposed on Richard in the previous parliament. Knighton maintained that he threatened Chief Justice Robert Bealknap with death if he did not put his seal to the document embodying the judges' answers to Richard's questions about his rights put to them at Nottingham in August. In mid-November, when both the king's associates and their opponents were preparing to resort to arms, the Monk of Westminster maintained that Suffolk tried unsuccessfully to persuade the king to have the earl of Warwick put to death on the ground that he was the opposition's ringleader. Some days later, according to Walsingham, he tried so hard to prevent any reconciliation between the king and Gloucester that the bishop of London had to persuade him to be silent.<h2>
<a name="Exileanddeath"></a>Exile and death</h2>Attempts at mediation between the king and his opponents made little headway, and on 14 November Gloucester, Arundel, and the earl of Warwick published an appeal of treason (from which they were known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53093/', "lords appellant")</script>) against Suffolk, Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1392), and three others of the king's closest associates. The three original appellant lords were joined by two others, Henry, earl of Derby, and Thomas (I) Mowbray, earl of Nottingham, and de Vere's attempt to settle the issue in favour of the king by force failed at Radcot Bridge on 20 December. By this time Suffolk may already have fled abroad. First of all he attempted to seek refuge in Calais, where his brother Edmund was captain of the castle. According to Knighton he shaved off his hair and beard, and attempted to gain entry to the castle disguised as a Flemish poulterer with a basket of capons. But his brother recognized him&#151;with difficulty&#151;and refused to admit him without the agreement of Sir William Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1411), the governor of the town. This was not forthcoming, and Beauchamp sent him back to London. The king then allowed him to go to Kingston upon Hull, and Suffolk eluded a royal serjeant who had been sent there on 27 December to arrest him by fleeing to Dordrecht. He eventually reached Paris, though possibly no earlier than the summer of 1389.<br>
<br>Suffolk was convicted of treason in his absence by the Merciless Parliament which assembled on 3 February 1388. The essence of the charges against him, the earl of Oxford, and the other three was that they had accroached the royal power, had sought to impede the work of the commission established in the previous parliament, and had used their influence over the king to further their own ends. All four lay appellees were sentenced to death and all of them to forfeiture of their lands, titles, goods, and chattels. Suffolk himself was out of reach of his accusers, but all his lands and goods were taken into the king's hands and he was deprived of his earldom. Under a statute passed at the end of the parliament, however, the entailed lands of the earldom were exempted from permanent forfeiture. Michael de la Pole did not long survive his downfall. He died in Paris on 5 September 1389, and Walsingham observed that &#145;his spirit deservedly departed from its earthly pilgrimage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 2.187). Walsingham also stated that he left all his money and goods to his fellow exile, Robert de Vere. However, the former archbishop of York, Alexander Neville (<i>d</i>. 1392), who had also escaped the appellants in 1388 and was in exile in Paris, said in a letter to the abbot of Selby that de la Pole had bequeathed him 20,000 gold pounds to enable him to pursue his right at the curia in Rome. Even if this sum is taken to mean pounds of Paris or Tours rather than sterling (&pound;4000 sterling if pounds of Paris, or &pound;3000 if pounds of Tours) it suggests that de la Pole had been able to obtain substantial resources from England, in spite of the forfeiture of all his property.<h2>
<a name="DelaPolescharacterandfamily"></a>De la Pole's character and family</h2>Michael de la Pole's career was to demonstrate more clearly even than that of his father the opportunities for social advancement in late fourteenth-century England, but also the attendant risks. Despite his impeachment in 1386 and exile in 1388, he brought his family to the front rank of English society, and laid the foundations of its power and prosperity. His rapid advancement through the English nobility and to the highest office in government owed much to his sense of loyalty to the king. In his speech at the opening of his first parliament as chancellor in October 1383 he laid stress on the subject's duty of obedience to the king and his ministers, and his attempt to prevent the king's reconciliation with the duke of Gloucester in November 1387 may have been grounded in this view of the nature of royal authority and the duty of subjects. In his pursuit of peace with France after 1383, too, he may have been motivated in part by a belief that disputes over finance were damaging the authority of the crown.<br>
<br>Among his contemporaries, however, there was a sense that de la Pole was something of an outsider. For all his eminence, his family's mercantile origins were not easily forgotten, and there may still have been some resentment against the family because of William de la Pole's financial dealings with Edward III. Walsingham acidly observed that Michael de la Pole was a man more suited to commerce than to warfare, and the suggestion at his impeachment that he lacked the status to justify his promotion to an earldom may have reflected the same feeling, however unfair such a suggestion may have been.<br>
<br>De la Pole himself did not forget his family's origins in Kingston upon Hull. He retained a house there which, at the time of his forfeiture in 1388, had substantial furnishings as well as silver plate to the value of &pound;40 13<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. In 1377 he obtained leave from Edward III to alter his father's plan to found a house of Poor Clares in the town, and establish instead a house of thirteen Carthusian monks with a hospital attached. De la Pole intended his foundation to serve as a family mausoleum. In her will drawn up in 1381 his mother asked to be buried there; his wife was buried there in 1385, and some time in the 1390s de la Pole's own body was brought back from Paris and interred there.<br>
<br>Michael de la Pole had six children. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22453/', "Michael de la Pole (1367/8&#150;1415)")</script>, seems to have sympathized with the lords appellant in 1387&#150;8. He gained possession of the entailed lands of his family&#151;which had been confiscated only during his father's lifetime&#151;shortly after his father's death. In January 1398 the judgment against his father was annulled, and the younger Michael was restored to the title and lands of the earldom. The first earl's second son, William, became a canon of Beverley, and his third son, Thomas, married Anne Cheyne. Two other sons died, probably in infancy or childhood. His elder daughter, Anne, married Gerard Lisle, while his younger daughter, Margaret, remained unmarried.<br>
