<span class="headword">Mends, Sir  Robert</span>  (1767?&#150;1823), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, from a Pembrokeshire family, was probably born in 1767. He entered the navy in 1779 on board the <i>Culloden</i> with Captain George Balfour, and in her was present at the action off Cape St Vincent and the relief of Gibraltar in January 1780. Afterwards, in the frigate <i>Guadeloupe</i>, with Captain Hugh Robinson, he was present at the action off the mouth of the Chesapeake on 16 March 1781, and at the defence of Yorktown, where the <i>Guadeloupe</i> was destroyed and Mends, then not fourteen, lost his right arm, besides being wounded in the left knee. On his recovery he was again with Captain Balfour in the <i>Conqueror</i>, one of the van of the fleet in the battle of Dominica, where he was severely wounded in the head by a splinter. In 1786 he was in the <i>Grampus</i> with Commodore Edward Thompson on the coast of Africa. On 26 August 1789 he was promoted lieutenant. He was then for some time in the sloop <i>Childers</i> in the channel. In 1793 he was in the <i>Colossus</i> in the Mediterranean and was at the occupation of Toulon, and in 1795, still in the <i>Colossus</i>, was in the action off Lorient on 23 June, when he was severely burnt by a powder explosion. On 15 December 1796 he was promoted commander, and for the next three years commanded the sloop <i>Diligence</i> (16 guns) on the Jamaica station. He was advanced to post rank on 2 May 1800, and, continuing on the same station, successively commanded the <i>Abergavenny</i> (54 guns), the <i>Thunderer</i> (74 guns), and the frigate <i>Quebec</i> (32 guns). In September 1802 he returned to England in the <i>N&eacute;r&eacute;ide</i> (36 guns).<br>
<br>In 1805 Mends was appointed to command the sea fencibles of the Dublin district and in 1808 to the frigate <i>Arethusa</i> (46 guns) in the Bay of Biscay and on the north coast of Spain. On the morning of 6 April 1809 she assisted in the closing stage of the action between the <i>Amethyst</i> and <i>Niemen</i>. The <i>Arethusa</i>'s share in it was small, but Mends was severely wounded in the head by a splinter. In the summer of 1810, in command of a squadron on the coast of Spain, Mends destroyed several French batteries, for which service, in addition to a formal letter of thanks from the junta of Galicia, he received the order of the Cross of Victory of the Asturias and the nominal rank of major-general of the Spanish army. From 1811 to 1814 he was superintendent of the prison hulks in Portsmouth harbour. On 25 May 1815 he was knighted, on receiving permission to wear the cross of the order of Charles III of Spain; and in April 1816, the pension of &pound;7, which had been granted him for the loss of his arm, was increased to &pound;300. In June 1821 he was appointed commodore and commander-in-chief on the west coast of Africa, with his broad pennant first in the <i>Iphig&eacute;nie</i> (42 guns) and afterwards in the frigate <i>Owen Glendower</i>. He died on board the <i>Owen Glendower</i> at Cape Coast, on the Gold Coast, on 4 September 1823.<br>
<br>Mends married in 1802 a daughter of James Butler of Bagshot; they had three sons, of whom one, a midshipman of the <i>Owen Glendower</i>, died at Sierra Leone three months after his father; another, James Augustus Mends, died a captain on the retired list in 1875; the third, George Clarke Mends, was a retired vice-admiral at his death in 1885. Admiral Sir William Robert Mends (1812&#150;1897) was the son of Sir Robert's brother Admiral William Bowen Mends (1781&#150;1864).<br>
