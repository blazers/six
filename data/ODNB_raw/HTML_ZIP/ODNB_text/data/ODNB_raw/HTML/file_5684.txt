<span class="headword">Clinton,  Henry  Fynes</span>  (1781&#150;1852), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Gamston, Nottinghamshire, on 14 January 1781, the first of the three sons of Charles Fynes (1747?&#150;1827), rector of Gamston and Cromwell, and his wife, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of Job Brough of Newark. Charles Fynes became prebendary of St Peter's, Westminster, in 1788 and minister of St Margaret's, Westminster, in 1797. He assumed the additional name of Clinton on 26 April 1821 by royal licence for himself and his issue in recognition of descent from Henry Clinton, second earl of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1616). Henry Fynes was educated at Southwell grammar school (1789&#150;96), where Magnus Jackson instilled in him habits of intellectual discipline, and at Westminster School (1796&#150;99). He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in April 1799. He later wrote that at Oxford then &#145;Greek learning was perhaps at the lowest point of degradation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 5: <span class="italic">18th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 524), and that he was inadequately taught and gained more from discussions with friends than from his official teachers. He read voraciously and prodigiously in Greek literature and conceived the love of classical scholarship which became the passion and solace of his life. He graduated BA in March 1803 and MA by examination in 1805, and remained in Oxford until 1806 as private tutor to Francis, Lord Gower, son of George Granville Leveson-Gower, second marquess of Stafford. In 1825 he deplored the low state of classical education at Oxford and compared English research unfavourably with German.<br>
<br>Fynes abandoned a planned career in the church in response to the wish of his kinsman and benefactor Isaac Gardiner of Saffron Walden, Essex, that he should become &#145;a country gentleman&#146;. (On Gardiner's death in 1811 he inherited landed property in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, and Middlesex and so acquired &#145;a comfortable independence&#146;.) He was studying at Oxford when Henry Pelham, fourth duke of Newcastle, another distant relative, returned him to parliament for Aldborough, Yorkshire, by arrangement with his father at the general election in November 1806. &#145;Astonished at finding himself called to the duties of a Member of Parliament&#146; and feeling himself to be &#145;unprepared and unqualified for such a situation&#146;, he studied history and economics in a conscientious attempt to qualify himself for a political career  (<span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>, 19, 45). At first he &#145;diligently attended the business of the House&#146; and was &#145;not without the ambition of becoming a speaker&#146;, but his &#145;natural reserve&#146; and &#145;lack of readiness of expression&#146; defeated him; his only known contribution to debate in almost twenty years was a brief one on election petition procedure on 25 May 1821  (ibid., 25, 31). Uncompromisingly hostile to Catholic relief, like Newcastle, he opposed the short-lived Grenville ministry and supported its successor under the duke of Portland, whose offer to appoint him to a place at the Admiralty board in March 1807 was declined for him by Newcastle. He came in unopposed for Aldborough at the general elections of 1807, 1812, and 1818 and was successful in a token contest in 1820. In 1807 he published <span class="italic">Solyman, a Tragedy</span>, of which hardly fifty copies were sold.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1809 Fynes married Harriott, the eldest daughter of the Revd Charles Wylde, rector of St Nicholas, Nottingham. She died in premature childbirth on 2 February 1810 and the child, a boy, lived for only a few hours. Grief temporarily kept him from parliament, but he resumed attendance late in the year to support the administration of Spencer Perceval, whom he admired, on the regency question. On 6 January 1812 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 25 April 1871), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17842/', "Henry William Majendie (1754&#150;1830)")</script>, bishop of Bangor; they had two sons, who predeceased him, and nine daughters, seven of whom survived him. His son Charles Francis Fynes Clinton, BA of Christ Church, Oxford, served in the Christina army in Spain, was British arbitrator under the Anglo-Portuguese anti-slavery treaty, and died at Luanda on 5 June 1844. In 1812 Henry Fynes bought the mansion and estate of Welwyn in Hertfordshire, where he chiefly lived for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Fynes's parliamentary attendance became more sporadic as his literary pursuits increasingly consumed his time and interest. He gave general support to Lord Liverpool's ministry, but cast a few wayward votes on economy and taxation in 1816. He voted consistently against parliamentary reform. By the end of 1819 he had &#145;entirely abandoned&#146; any idea of making a mark in politics and, shunning the notion of taking office, which he thought would &#145;impair my health, waste my spirits, and withdraw me from that literature by which I am best able to be useful to myself and others&#146;, concluded that he was &#145;destitute of political ambition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>, 140&#150;41). A convinced believer in a revealed religion, he claimed in 1822 to be able to &#145;look with philosophical indifference upon the vain pursuits of ambition, and to appreciate justly the value of that safe mediocrity of station and fortune in which I am placed&#146;. Yet in February 1824 he got Newcastle to try to obtain for him a place at one of the public boards, preferably customs or excise, but Liverpool could not oblige him. He consoled himself with the observation that &#145;the loss of a lucrative post is the less to be regretted, because the possession of it would have been accompanied with a sacrifice, in part at least&#146;, of his &#145;two great objects&#146; of giving his children a decent education and of advancing &#145;learning and moral and religious truth&#146;  (ibid., 205, 221&#150;2). At the dissolution in June 1826 he retired from parliament, reflecting that he had been, &#145;as far as public speaking is concerned, an inefficient Member&#146;  (ibid., 247). The greatest disappointment of his life was his failure to secure the principal librarianship of the British Museum in December 1827, when he was passed over in favour of Henry Ellis, the long-serving keeper of printed books. An application on his behalf by Newcastle for the receiver-generalship of Nottinghamshire in 1832 also came to nothing.<br>
<br>Fynes Clinton achieved some measure of happiness with his literary studies, his &#145;consolation and peace and security against my own passions, and in the midst of many tribulations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>, 292&#150;3). Resuming them after the death of his first wife, he turned them to good account by directing his reading towards the production of works on Greek and Roman chronology. The first part of his <span class="italic">Fasti Hellenici: the Civil and Literary Chronology of Greece</span> was published by the Clarendon Press in January 1824 and favourably reviewed. Further instalments appeared in 1830 and 1834. His publications included articles in the classical journal <span class="italic">The Philological Museum</span>. His <span class="italic">Fasti Romani: the Civil and Literary Chronology of Rome and Constantinople</span> was published in two volumes in 1845 and 1850. <span class="italic">Epitome of the Civil and Literary Chronology of Greece</span> came out in 1851, and he was compiling a companion work on Rome until a fortnight before his death at Welwyn House, Hertfordshire, on 24 October 1852. It was completed and published in 1853 by his only surviving brother, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5678/', "Revd Charles John Fynes Clinton")</script>, who also edited and published in 1854 his <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>, which contains his autobiography (written in 1818), his literary journal (1819&#150;52), and some essays on theology; his other brother, Clinton James Fynes Clinton (1792&#150;1833), had replaced him as member for Aldborough. Fynes Clinton applied a more exacting and critical scholarship to ancient chronology than had earlier chronologists and included a &#145;literary chronology&#146; with evidence for the dating of ancient authors. His major work was of long-lasting importance, though today it is rarely consulted.<br>
