<span class="headword">Livingston,  Jean</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lady Warriston]</span>  (1579&#150;1600), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was the daughter of John Livingston, laird of Dunipace, a man of good family and fortune, and a favourite of James VI. She was married young to John Kincaid of Warriston, lands then to the north of Edinburgh. Whether or not he did, as some suggested, treat her cruelly, she came to hate him, and began to listen to Janet Murdo, her old nurse, who suggested murder as a means of revenge and escape from her marriage. Robert Weir, a young servant to Livingston, who was then in attendance on the king at Holyrood, was proposed as the man to effect it. He proved willing, and came to Warriston's house on 1 July 1600 to discuss the plan.<br>
<br>No time was wasted; that evening Warriston was induced to exceed his usual measure of wine and went off to bed. After midnight, Weir, who had been secreted in the house, went into Warriston's chamber, knocked him out of bed, kicked him, then strangled him as he lay on the floor. Hearing the cries, Jean Livingston leapt from her bed and with her nurse went to the hall, where Weir came to tell them that Warriston was dead. It is not known how the news reached Edinburgh, but the officers of justice came to the house next morning, found the body, and arrested Jean, her nurse, and two other women. Weir, meanwhile, had fled. The trial took place before the Edinburgh magistrates on 3 July. Jean showed no grief or remorse, was found guilty, and condemned to death by strangulation followed by burning at the stake, the nurse also to be burnt. Livingston made no effort to save his daughter's life, and the family, resenting the disgrace her deed had brought on them, urged a quick end to the matter.<br>
<br>While held in the Tolbooth, Jean Livingston had been visited by a Presbyterian minister whom she had treated in a very offhand fashion; after sentence was passed she summoned the minister, who now found her truly penitent and resigned to her fate. This conversion was described in a small pamphlet of the day, entitled <span class="italic">Memorial of the conversion of Jean Livingston (Lady Warriston), with an account of her carriage at her execution</span>, republished in 1827. They spent most of the day in prayer together; Jean dictated her will to the minister, and he left, to return early on the morning of 5 July 1600, the execution now changed to one of beheading by the guillotine known as &#145;the Maiden&#146;. Her family wished this to take place early when few people would be about the streets, and they arranged that the nurse should be burnt at the stake on Castle Hill at four in the morning, thus attracting the attention of anyone on the streets, while Jean was taken down Canongate to the Girth Cross, the ancient boundary of the abbey sanctuary. Warriston's brother, who was present, showed sufficient humanity to kiss Jean and forgive her. The eyewitness author of the <span class="italic">Memorial</span> stated that she went as cheerfully as if to her wedding rather than her death, and that she read an address to the many spectators and continued to utter devotions until silenced by the fall of the blade.<br>
<br>Weir was arrested four years later, tried on 26 June 1604, and condemned to be taken to the Edinburgh scaffold and there broken on the wheel, a most unusual punishment in Scotland at that time. The cold-blooded nature of the crime was commemorated in songs variously ascribing blame to the husband, the wife, or the devil.<br>
