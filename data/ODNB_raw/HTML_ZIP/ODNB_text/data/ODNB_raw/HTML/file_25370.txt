<span class="headword">Sheridan,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobite Sir Thomas Sheridan, baronet]</span>  (1684&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite official</span>, was the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25368/', "Thomas Sheridan (1646&#150;1712)")</script>, government official and Jacobite pamphleteer, and his wife, Helen (<i>c</i>.1662&#150;1702), daughter of Thomas Appleby of Lynton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire, and his wife, Helen. (Family legend maintains that Helen Sheridan was actually the illegitimate daughter of the future James II and Anne Hyde, before their marriage.) Some contemporary documents refer to Sheridan as Irish, but evidence to ascertain if there was more to this than paternal descent is lacking. His mother was a Roman Catholic, and his father converted to Catholicism in 1686. The family followed James II into exile in France following the events of 1688, and Sheridan was educated at the Jesuit Coll&egrave;ge Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He may also have spent some time in Rome as a youth.<br>
<br>About 1706 Sheridan went to London to study law, and on 18 January of that year was admitted to the Middle Temple. Following the death of Queen Anne in 1714 he returned to France and became a courier in the Jacobite rising of 1715. In 1717 and 1718 he carried messages back and forth in the Jacobite attempt to instigate a Russo-Swedish alliance against the Hanoverians, travelling widely in northern and eastern Europe. Late 1720 saw him at the Jacobite court in Rome, where he was employed in both secretarial and diplomatic capacities. In 1725 he became under-governor to Prince Charles Edward Stuart, and his indulgent and devoted care of the boy, while not an educational success, none the less created a uniquely strong bond of trust between them. The following year (17 March 1726) Sheridan was awarded an Irish baronetcy by James III (James Francis Edward Stuart). In 1734 he accompanied the prince to his first military engagement&#151;the siege of Gaeta in the kingdom of Naples. He played a key role in the elaborate subterfuge designed to conceal Charles's journey to Paris in 1744, when it was believed that the French were about to restore the Stuarts. Once established in the French capital Charles soon sent for Sir Thomas, who, after a brief period of princely disfavour, became actively involved in the young prince's plans to mount a rising in Scotland. He was one of the &#145;seven men of Moidart&#146; who landed on the Scottish coast with the prince in July 1745 and was present throughout the subsequent campaign. In poor health and in his early sixties (not seventies as some modern accounts maintain), and lacking a military background, his role was secretarial and advisory. A member of the prince's council, he was criticized by a number of the Scottish members for being a key figure in a perceived Irish coterie around the prince. After defeat at the battle of Culloden in 1746 Sheridan managed to escape to France, whence he was summoned to Rome by James III to explain his part in the recent events. It was in Rome that Sheridan died, unmarried, of a stroke on 23 November 1746; he was buried there the following day in the church of the Twelve Apostles.<br>
