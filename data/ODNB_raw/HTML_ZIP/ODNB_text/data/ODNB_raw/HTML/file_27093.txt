<span class="headword">Taylor,  William Benjamin Sarsfield</span>  (1781&#150;1850), <span class="occ">painter of landscapes and military subjects and writer</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of John McKinley Taylor (<i>fl</i>. 1765&#150;1819), a map and seal engraver. John McKinley Taylor had assumed the name Taylor on inheriting property from his maternal grandfather. J. M. Taylor was descended from David McKinley, a captain of the Inniskilling dragoons, who fought at the battle of the Boyne. Through his mother, William Taylor was descended from Patrick Sarsfield, titular earl of Lucan. The barrister and journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27064/', "John Sydney Taylor")</script> was his younger brother. He became a pupil in the Dublin Society Schools in 1800 and in 1801 won the prize for the second best landscape. He exhibited at the society's exhibitions in various years from 1802 to 1817, although by 1804 he had left the schools and was supporting himself as a teacher of drawing.<br>
<br>Taylor spent some time in the army, serving in the commissariat in the Peninsular War. He was present at the siege of San Sebastian, and would later exhibit sketches of the engagement.<br>
<br>After returning to Dublin, Taylor exhibited there in 1815, 1816, and 1817. He became a member of the committee responsible for the foundation of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1823. Afterwards he moved to London, although his work was exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy from 1827 to 1829. He exhibited landscapes, seapieces, and military subjects at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, and the Society of British Artists between 1829 and 1847. He became better known as an art critic and writer, contributing critical essays to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and he published in 1841 <span class="italic">The Origin, Progress, and Present Conditions of the Fine Arts in Great Britain and Ireland</span>. Other publications included <span class="italic">A Manual of Fresco and Encaustic Painting</span> (1843); a translation of J. F. L. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's <span class="italic">Art of Painting in Oil and Fresco</span> (1839); an abridged translation of the <span class="italic">Origin and Outline of the Penitentiary System in the United States of North America</span> (1833), from the report of G. de Beaumont and A. de Tocqueville; and his best-known work, a <span class="italic">History of the University of Dublin</span> (1845), which contains biographical notices of alumni, and is illustrated with coloured plates drawn and etched by Taylor himself.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Taylor was curator of the St Martin's Lane Academy. He died at his home, 46 Robert Street, Hampstead Road, London, on 23 December 1850, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. A <span class="italic">Seascape</span> by Taylor is in the Williamson Art Gallery and Museum, Birkenhead.<br>
