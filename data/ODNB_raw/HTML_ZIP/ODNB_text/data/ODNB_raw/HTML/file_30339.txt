<span class="headword">Adamson,  Robert</span>  (1852&#150;1902), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 19 January 1852, fifth of the six children of Robert Adamson (<i>d</i>. 1855), solicitor, and Mary Agnes Buist, daughter of Matthew Buist, factor to the earl of Haddington. His father died when Adamson was three years old, and his mother&#151;whose own father had been ejected for heresy from the Society of Friends&#151;was at pains to ensure her children's education and to share their studies. The boy passed from Daniel Stewart's Hospital, Edinburgh, to Edinburgh University in November 1866, and, after obtaining first prizes in metaphysics and in English literature, graduated in 1871 with first-class honours in philosophy and with a scholarship awarded to the best graduate in that subject. He spent the summer of 1871 at Heidelberg, and acted as assistant the following winter to Henry Calderwood, professor of moral philosophy at Edinburgh, and in 1872&#150;4 to A. Campbell Fraser, professor of logic and metaphysics. During these years he read omnivorously in the Signet Library and elsewhere, and gained other postgraduate scholarships or fellowships, including the Ferguson scholarship and the Shaw fellowship, both open to graduates of any Scottish university. In 1874 he was appointed additional examiner in philosophy in the university, and joined the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (9th edn). He contributed a large number of articles on subjects of general literature, and in the third volume began a series of important philosophical articles, including those on Francis Bacon, Hume, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, and an article on &#145;Logic&#146;, which, along with a book on Kant (1879) and one on Fichte (1881), expressed the idealism of his earlier thought.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1876 Adamson was appointed professor of philosophy and political economy at Owens College, Manchester, in succession to W. Stanley Jevons. After six years economics was established as a separate chair, but he greatly extended the philosophical teaching, especially after 1880, when the creation of the Victoria University gave him freedom to plan the work in accordance with his own views. He also gave popular lectures in Manchester, for example on &#145;The restoration of Germany&#146;. On 6 September 1881 he married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1858/9), daughter of David Duncan, a Manchester linen merchant, who survived him with two sons and four daughters, the eldest of whom, Mary (1882&#150;1966), became labour MP for Blackburn [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39455/', "Hamilton, Mary Agnes")</script>]. He was made an honorary LLD of Glasgow in 1883.<br>
<br>In 1893 Adamson was appointed professor of logic at the University of Aberdeen. He moved to Glasgow in 1895 on his election to the professorship of logic and rhetoric there. Between 1885 and 1901 he acted on six occasions as examiner for the moral science tripos at Cambridge. For five years (1887&#150;91) he was one of the examiners in mental and moral science in the University of London. He was also the first external examiner in philosophy (1896&#150;9) to the newly founded University of Wales.<br>
<br>Adamson took an active part in academic business. At Manchester he warmly supported the admission of women students to college and university on equal terms with men; he also supported the enfranchisement of women. He threw himself zealously into the movement for an independent university, and when the Victoria University was created in 1880 he took a prominent part in its organization. He acted as temporary registrar, was first secretary and afterwards chairman of the new board of studies, and gave important assistance to the institution of the university department for training elementary teachers. At Glasgow he served on the court as well as on the senatus, and took a leading part in the early stages of the movement which afterwards resulted in substituting a three-term system for the unbroken session of the Scottish universities. He was also a keen politician, and gave active support to the advanced liberal party.<br>
<br>After the early 1880s Adamson's publications became fewer, partly because of the pressures of teaching and university business, partly because of his active, practical nature. He was a friendly man who radiated happiness. He took up climbing and tennis and found &#145;time for everything&#151;except to write&#146;  (Sorley, xliii). The gradual change in his philosophical views also made it hard for him to commit them to print. Aside from a period as a student when the works of John Stuart Mill appealed to him, he was strongly influenced throughout his career by Kant. But his project of bringing Kant's critical method into constant discourse with new knowledge supplied by science generated a continual evolution of his thought away from idealism and towards a version of realism. During his period at Owens College his approach to Kant was broadly Hegelian, but by the mid-1890s he was arguing that the antitheses and abstractions of Kant's thought were to be resolved in a unity supplied not by speculative philosophy or metaphysics but by a return to concrete experience. He held that, contrary to the subjectivist character of Kant's theory of knowledge, the reality that precedes mind's activity is not a turmoil of unconnected sensations. It has an integrity which can be rediscovered by the systematic exclusion of the divisions imposed by the mind. Mind is not, however, less essential than, or inferior to, nature; each is a partial manifestation of reality. An outline of a theory of knowledge on these lines is given in the concluding part of Adamson's posthumously published <span class="italic">Development of Modern Philosophy</span> (1903), a work which was derived by its editor, W. R. Sorley, from notes on Adamson's lectures. Two other works were also published posthumously, <span class="italic">The Development of Greek Philosophy</span> (1908) and <span class="italic">A Short History of Logic</span> (1911). But Adamson's mature thought was never worked out by him in detail, nor subjected to the same thorough criticism as idealistic philosophies received at his hands.<br>
<br>Both in his earlier and in his later period Adamson's own views are developed by means of a critical study of the history of thought. Following the biological analogy of &#145;recapitulation&#146; he found in the history of philosophy a treatment, only more elaborate and leisurely, of the same questions as those which face the individual enquirer. In general his work is distinguished by extensive and exact learning, by keen perception of the essential points in a problem, by great power of clear and sustained reasoning, by complete impartiality, and by rigid exclusion of metaphor and the imaginative factor. More than thirty years after his death he was described as &#145;since Sir William Hamilton &hellip; undoubtedly the greatest philosophical scholar whom the British nation has produced&#146;  (Metz, 495). On 5 February 1902 he died of enteric fever at Glasgow; his body was cremated at the Western Necropolis. In 1904 the Adamson lecture was founded in his memory at the University of Manchester. His philosophical books, numbering about 4387 volumes, were presented to Manchester University by his wife.<br>
