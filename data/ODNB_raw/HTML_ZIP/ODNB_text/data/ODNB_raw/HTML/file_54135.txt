<span class="headword">Borthwick family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1400&#150;<em>c.</em>1515), <span class="occ">landowners and administrators</span>, provided some significant servants to the Scottish crown, especially in the second half of the fifteenth century. There are problems in constructing this family's genealogy, as between <i>c</i>.1370 and 1544 all the heads of the family bore the Christian name William and before 1500 it is difficult to distinguish between them. The successful petition to the lord Lyon king of arms in the case of John Henry Stuart Borthwick of that ilk to succeed as Lord Borthwick, conducted in 1984&#150;6, altered the previously accepted enumeration of the lords Borthwick by amalgamating the putative first and second lords.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54138"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Borthwick of that ilk</span>  (<em>c.</em>1385&#150;<em>c.</em>1449)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of another Sir William Borthwick (<i>d</i>. 1429), who, through his particular service to Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas, had brought the family into contact with the royal court. The name of the father's spouse is not recorded. Before the return of King James I from captivity in England in 1424 the younger William was briefly captain of Edinburgh Castle (whose keeper was the earl of Douglas). The accounts of the custumars of Edinburgh show that for some years up to 1420 Borthwick (and others) were abusing their power to seize moneys due to be paid to the crown, and were exporting goods without paying custom. The death of his mentor seems to have resulted in Borthwick's seeking crown patronage instead. He was knighted <i>c</i>.1424 and in June 1425 was (with nine others) appointed as ambassador from Scotland to Rome. (The purpose of the embassy may have been to discuss the export of money by Scottish clerics to purchase benefices from the papacy.) While he was in Rome, his father was in England as one of the hostages for the ransom demanded for the king's release. In June 1430 the younger Sir William obtained from James I a licence to build at the mote of Locherworth what became Borthwick Castle, Edinburghshire, which is certainly a building of that period. In 1436&#150;7 Sir David Hay of Yester, whose family had property rights at Locherworth, recorded protests about Borthwick's possession of the mote, but a settlement must have been reached. Sir William, who died about 1449, is stated to have married <i>c</i>.1411 Beatrice, possibly daughter of Henry Sinclair, first earl of Orkney. They had at least one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Their son <a name="cosubject_54140"></a><span class="headword">William Borthwick</span>, first Lord Borthwick  (<em>c.</em>1412&#150;1483)<span class="occ"></span>, was knighted at the baptism of the infant James II in October 1430. He was created Lord Borthwick in June 1452, a time when James II was anxious to ensure that he had sufficient allies immediately after the stabbing to death of William, eighth earl of Douglas, at whom the king himself had struck the first blow. Borthwick occasionally witnessed crown charters in the next few years and was ambassador during truce negotiations with England. He was regularly present at parliament, however, where he acted as a lord auditor of causes (legal disputes); and he performed in a similar capacity as a lord of the king's council. From mid-1482 he was a frequent witness of crown charters until his death in December 1483. Although he may have married twice, no spouse's name is known. (The peerage petition of 1984&#150;6 was inaccurate in stating that his second wife was Marion Hoppringle.) He had five sons and one daughter, but it is not clear who was the mother of any of the children. His eldest son (who had been knighted by 1468), <a name="cosubject_66646"></a><span class="headword">William Borthwick</span>, second Lord Borthwick  (<em>c.</em>1428&#150;1503), immediately succeeded his father as a <span class="occ">witness of crown charters</span>, lord auditor of causes, and lord of council. He was for a time master of the king's household and remained loyal to James III apparently right up to the king's death on the battlefield of Sauchieburn (11 June 1488) during James's conflict with his son and heir. After the accession of James IV, Borthwick was seldom a witness of crown charters, but remained a regular lord auditor and lord of council. By this stage, if not earlier, the family possessed land in Selkirkshire, Peeblesshire, Berwickshire, Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh, and Edinburghshire, where its principal estate lay. The second Lord Borthwick died on 30 April 1503; his spouse's name is not known. The couple seem to have had three sons and perhaps five daughters. The eldest son succeeded as <a name="cosubject_54139"></a><span class="headword">William Borthwick</span>, third Lord Borthwick  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1513?). Like his father, he was frequently a <span class="occ">lord auditor and lord of council</span>, but was not a witness of crown charters. He was apparently killed at the battle of Flodden, on 9 September 1513. He had married Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54232/', "John Hay, Lord Hay of Yester")</script>, about 1491. They had at least one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2922/', "William Borthwick")</script>, who succeeded to his father's title. Although the family was not represented constantly at court, from 1450 its heads undertook frequent duties at parliament and council as auditors of causes, and were also often ambassadors.<br>
