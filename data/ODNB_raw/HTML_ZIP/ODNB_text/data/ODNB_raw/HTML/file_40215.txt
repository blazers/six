<span class="headword">Told,  Silas</span>  (1711&#150;1778), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and prison visitor</span>, was born at the Lime Kilns in Bristol on 3 April 1711 of &#145;very creditable&#146; parentage. His father, a physician like his paternal grandfather, lost money invested in the building of a wet dock and died at sea. His mother was the daughter of Captain Thomas Suckabitch or Sucksbury of Topsham. He was admitted at age eight to the charity school founded by Edward Colston, where he had a vision of eternal bliss after nearly drowning. In 1725 he went to sea as an apprentice to Moses Lilly, captain of the merchantman <span class="italic">Prince of Wales</span>. The hazards of the voyages he experienced and his harsh treatment at the hands of those under whom he served are described in his autobiography, <span class="italic">An Account of the Life, and Dealings of God with Silas Told</span> (1786), a second edition of which appeared in 1790 under the title, <span class="italic">The Life of Mr. Silas Told, Written by himself</span>. After several transatlantic crossings and voyages to west Africa and the Mediterranean, he and his fellow crewmen were press-ganged into the navy; but he was fortunate to serve under a humane, Christian captain. In 1736 he was discharged, two years after marrying Mary Verney (<i>c</i>.1713&#150;1744), and found employment first at a charity school at Stapleford Tawney, Essex, then as a clerk, and eventually as bookkeeper to a London builder. Under the influence of one of the young bricklayers, Charles Caspar Graves, Told reluctantly went to hear John Wesley preach at Short's Gardens and the Foundery Chapel, where he was convinced of sin and attached himself to the Methodists, despite family opposition. Following his wife's death, he was persuaded to take charge of the charity school at the Foundery. Wesley described him as &#145;a man of good understanding, although not much indebted to education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, preface). His temporal circumstances were improved by a second marriage, the details of which are unknown. For about three years he suffered bouts of spiritual anguish until convinced of the forgiveness of his sins while walking alone in the fields one morning. Influenced by Wesley's sermon on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 25: 43, he began to visit prisoners in Newgate and other London gaols and to accompany condemned felons to the gallows at Tyburn. He maintained this ministry for many years and Wesley thought &#145;no man for this hundred years has been so successful in that melancholy office&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 6.221). Told died in December 1778 and was buried in London on the 20th.<br>
