<span class="headword">Chandler,  Raymond Thornton</span>  (1888&#150;1959), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Chicago, USA, on 23 July 1888, the only child of Maurice Benjamin Chandler (<i>b</i>. 1859), a railway engineer of Pennsylvanian Quaker descent, and his wife, Florence Thornton (<i>d</i>. 1924), one of five daughters from a respectable Anglo-Irish Quaker family from Waterford, Ireland, who was visiting a sister in Nebraska when she met Maurice. They married in Wyoming in 1887, but divorced seven years later because of Maurice's alcoholism and violent behaviour. Chandler never saw or heard from his father again. Florence and her son returned to Ireland, where they were received so coldly and ungraciously by her conservative family that they almost immediately moved to London, to a house in Upper Norwood, where Florence's elder brother Edward had agreed to look after them. Chandler was enrolled at the prestigious Dulwich College as a day boy in September 1900, and stayed there for the next four years.<br>
<br>With a view to entering the civil service, Chandler, financed by his uncle, spent 1905 in Paris, Munich, and Freiburg learning languages. In 1907 he came third out of the 800 candidates who sat the civil service examination, and he came top in the classics paper. He began work at the Admiralty but left after six months, disgruntled at being given orders by those he considered his inferiors. For the next five years he scratched a living from part-time teaching at Dulwich College, as a reporter for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and as a contributor of sketches, reviews, essays, and poems to the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> and <span class="italic">The Academy</span>.<br>
<br>Disenchanted with his literary progress in England, Chandler returned to America in 1912. In San Francisco he worked stringing tennis rackets, living in a succession of cheap boarding-houses. In all certainty, as his biographer Tom Hiney suggests, &#145;the character of Philip Marlowe was fleshed out in these resolute, if friendless and moneyless, months in Californian boarding houses&#146;  (Hiney, 37). Having been exceptional at mathematics at Dulwich, Chandler attended a bookkeeping course in the evenings, and after only a few months of part-time study he was employable as an accountant. In 1913 he moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a bookkeeper for the Los Angeles Creamery; his mother joined him a year later.<br>
<br>Chandler enlisted in the Canadian army in 1917 and was sent to France with the 7th battalion of the Canadian expeditionary force, fighting in the closing campaigns of the First World War. He was wounded in the trenches in June 1918 and returned to England, to the Royal Flying Corps at Waddington, where he learned to fly, but the war ended without his returning to combat. He left the armed forces in 1919 with the rank of sergeant, and went back to America, where he resumed work in the creamery. He also began an affair with Pearl Eugenie Hurlburt (Cissy) Pascal (1870&#150;1954), the wife of Julian Pascal, a classical musician, and the stepmother of one of his friends from the army. Cissy divorced her husband in 1920, but because Florence was bitterly opposed to her son's relationship, not least because Cissy was eighteen years older than Chandler, the couple had to wait until her death in January 1924 before they could marry on 6 February of that year. By this time Chandler was working for the Dabney Oil Syndicate as an extremely successful and wealthy executive. However, like his father, Chandler was an alcoholic (he had begun drinking during the war), and in 1932 he was sacked for drunkenness and chronic absenteeism. Chandler and Cissy lived off his savings while he learned to write crime fiction, a genre, he had noted with his businessman's eye, which was very lucrative.<br>
<br>Chandler began composing stories for the pulp magazine <span class="italic">Black Mask</span>, writing twenty-one in the 1930s. But it became obvious to editors and readers that his work was impressively different from the mass of crime fiction written during this &#145;golden age&#146; of pulp. Chandler's stories, such as &#145;Trouble is my Business&#146;, &#145;Smart Aleck Kill&#146;, &#145;Red Wind&#146;, &#145;Killer in the Rain&#146;, and &#145;The King in Yellow&#146;, showed an extraordinary eye for detail, and his imagery and use of simile were sharp and inventive. He invariably sacrificed plot for atmosphere and character, and grew adept at using a first-person narrator whose mordant meditations and witty observations, often extraneous to events, were considerably more interesting than the plot.<br>
<br>Although Chandler was well paid for the stories&#151;$350 per story from <span class="italic">Black Mask</span>, and $400 from <span class="italic">Dime Detective Magazine</span>&#151;he was struggling financially. In 1938, however, when he was fifty, the publisher Alfred Knopf saw some of his stories and asked to see a novel. <span class="italic">The Big Sleep</span>, featuring the private eye Philip Marlowe, was published the following year. Unlike most of his peers, Chandler effortlessly managed the transition from the short story to the novel, which drew on several of his <span class="italic">Black Mask</span> stories for its plot, but developed Marlowe's complexly insouciant yet dogged character and his downbeat view of contemporary urban life.<br>
<br>Over a twenty-year period Chandler wrote six more Marlowe novels. In the ingeniously plotted <span class="italic">Farewell my Lovely</span> (1940) Chandler explored his detective's fallibility and vulnerability. In <span class="italic">The High Window</span> (1942), Marlowe becomes more cynical and world-weary, and in <span class="italic">The Lady in the Lake</span> (1943), he is actively misanthropic, projecting his own despair onto the state of California, and onto modern life itself. <span class="italic">The Little Sister</span> (1949) is particularly remarkable for Marlowe's cleverly phrased and brutally honest self-evaluations, while throughout the convoluted <span class="italic">The Long Goodbye</span> (1953) he seems to have become reconciled to both his own and others' human weaknesses. <span class="italic">Playback</span> (1958), set in San Diego, is the most humorous of the novels and depicts Marlowe, now old and, in the eyes of the world, unsuccessful, but with his sense of humour, honour, and integrity intact.<br>
<br>Marlowe became a twentieth-century icon: honest, stubborn, stoical, witty, perceptive, but, like his creator, by no means perfect. Some commentators think that in Marlowe Chandler had created a combination of his own character and the traditional pulp hero. On the surface Marlowe was as lonely, unsociable, and self-persecuting as Chandler, but beneath that lay a sense of honour, humour, and sensitivity  (Hiney, 102). Chandler wrote in an essay: &#145;Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid&#146;  (<span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, 1942). Marlowe was just such a man. Chandler's hold on the world's imagination in the second half of the twentieth century is incontestable: his books have been translated into dozens of languages and sold millions of copies, yet he was and is much admired by intellectuals. The filmed versions of his novels, particularly <span class="italic">The Big Sleep</span>, <span class="italic">The Long Goodbye</span>, and <span class="italic">Farewell my Lovely</span>, carried Marlowe's tough wit to an even larger audience, while for many cineastes they mark a high point in American cinema.<br>
<br>In 1943, before his novels were as commercially and critically successful, Chandler was recruited as a screenwriter by Paramount Studios in Hollywood, where he worked with Billy Wilder on <span class="italic">Double Indemnity</span> (1944), which was nominated for two Oscars. He also scripted <span class="italic">The Blue Dahlia</span> (1945) and worked, unsatisfactorily, with Alfred Hitchcock on <span class="italic">Strangers on a Train</span> (1950). Despite the considerable amount of money he earned in Hollywood, however, he effectively left in 1946, buying a house in La Jolla, near San Diego, in order to concentrate on the novels for which he is best remembered.<br>
<br>Chandler was of average height, and although he was handsome and suave in his youth, alcoholism had ravaged his features and his figure by middle age. He enjoyed light classical music but otherwise, apart from Cissy, he had strikingly few interests. After Cissy died in December 1954, Chandler, devastated, drank more desperately than usual, and on 22 February 1955 he attempted to kill himself with a revolver at his home in La Jolla. The police intervened and escorted him to the psychiatric ward of San Diego County Hospital, and on the following day he was taken to the Chula Vista sanatorium, a private clinic, whence he discharged himself after a week. Although his drinking continued unabated, over the next five years Chandler regularly visited England, where he was a celebrity. He enjoyed the attention and became particularly friendly with Ian Fleming, Natasha Spender, and Helga Greene, who became his agent and to whom he proposed marriage in February 1959. Helga accepted, but Chandler's alcoholism was now in an advanced stage and he died of pneumonia, with complications attributable to alcoholism, at Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, on 26 March 1959, before the marriage could take place. He was buried on 30 March 1959 at the Mount Hope state cemetery, San Diego, and in February 2011, in accordance with his wishes, Cissy's ashes were interred in the same plot. Chandler's posthumous reputation was sealed in 1995, when his complete works were published by the <span class="roman">Library of America</span>, a far cry from the pulp magazines which had launched one of the most remarkable writing careers of the twentieth century.<br>
