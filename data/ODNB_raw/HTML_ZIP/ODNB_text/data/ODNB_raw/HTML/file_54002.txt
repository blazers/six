<span class="headword">Potter,  Lewis</span>  (1807&#150;1881), <span class="occ">shipping agent and banker</span>, was born on 27 May 1807 at Falkirk, the son of James Potter (1775&#150;1839), a timber merchant and brick manufacturer, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson (1781&#150;1831). He was apprenticed to David Chapman, a shipping agent in Glasgow, who had a small fleet of coastal sailing smacks trading down the west coast to Liverpool. Potter became a partner in the firm in 1832, when its name was changed to Chapman and Potter. Five years later the firm extended its agencies to include Dublin and the Isle of Man, and in 1839 Potter became sole partner. On 16 December 1833 he married Margaret Muirhead (1814&#150;1881), daughter of George Anderson Muirhead; they had three sons and eight daughters.<br>
<br>During the early 1840s in Glasgow there was intense speculation in Australian investments. To take advantage of the &#145;mania&#146;, Potter set up a new merchant and shipowning business in 1848 in partnership with Andrew Wilson&#151;Potter, Wilson &amp; Co. Wilson left within less than two years, and Potter took Wilson's eldest son, Andrew, into the partnership. Later they were joined by Potter's youngest son, John Alexander Potter. Together they soon became one of the largest Antipodean shippers in the west of Scotland, acting as agents for most of the leading Glasgow merchants and shipowners in the trade, including James Nicol Fleming, and Buchanan, Wilson &amp; Co. Through their agent, Glen Walker, they speculated heavily in Australian land and became wealthy men. Potter was reputed to have an annual income of over &pound;17,000 or &pound;18,000 and the partners sometimes to earn commissions of over &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>Between 1857 and 1859 Potter purchased Udston and adjoining properties for &pound;40,000 to form a large estate near Hamilton in Lanarkshire. Coal was soon found on the estate, raising its value to &pound;120,000. Although his bankers were the National Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Bank, he was invited to join the board of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1859 after payments had been suspended the year before. The object of this invitation was to bring together the bank's Australian interests with those of Potter to form the Australian Land and Investment Company. When the company in turn merged with James Morton's New Zealand interests in 1866 in the wake of the Overend Gurney crisis to form the New Zealand and Australian Land Company, Potter became a director with a shareholding of over &pound;60,000. The new firm continued to speculate heavily in land, borrowing enormous sums from the City of Glasgow Bank, which raised funds by extending its branch network throughout the west of Scotland. Little of the borrowing by either the Potters or the New Zealand and Australian Land Company was secured by the bank. Several of the more able directors, sensing that the bank was committing the cardinal sin of lending long and borrowing short, resigned in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Potter and his friends, who knew little of sound banking, were left in control. Potter on his own admission began to withdraw from business in the early 1870s, handing over to his son John Alexander Potter.<br>
<br>The economy spiralled downwards in the 1878 recession, and the City of Glasgow Bank collapsed on 1 October with debts of over &pound;5 million, sending shock waves throughout the banking world. Since the bank was unlimited, each shareholder faced eventual calls of &pound;2750 for every &pound;100 of stock. Many families were ruined, and throughout 1879 lists of shareholders who had to meet further calls or no longer had any resources appeared regularly in the Glasgow press. Only 254 of the 1819 shareholders remained solvent when the affairs of the bank were finally wound up, though the depositors were paid in full. &#145;The collapse of the bank was a traumatic experience for Glasgow: nearly 2000 families suffered severe loss; many were ruined&#146;  (Checkland, 471). The catastrophe had similar repercussions in both New Zealand and Australia.<br>
<br>Potter, personally, and his businesses were heavily indebted to the bank. In the processes of winding up the bank's affairs he was declared bankrupt and his property sold. Udston House was purchased by Robert McAlpine. Along with his fellow directors he was tried for fraud early in 1879 in a blaze of publicity, when it emerged that the accounts had been deliberately falsified, probably since 1866. Although he denied knowledge of the bank's reckless advances for foreign speculations, Potter was found guilty. As it was believed that he was more culpable than his fellow directors, he was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. He was released, apparently in good health, from Perth prison in July 1880, but died a broken man a year later, on 17 June 1881, at 15 Warrender Park Road, Edinburgh. Unlike other contemporary fraudsters&#151;Jabez Balfour or Whittaker Wright&#151;there were many, including the lawyer and investment manager David Murray, who believed Potter, an old man, had been harshly treated for crimes that were more a reflection on the management than on the directors of the bank.<br>
<br>The collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank arguably precipitated the worst British financial crisis of the nineteenth century, and all the Scottish banks suffered a very substantial fall in their paid-up capital. It also led to a major inquest into Scottish banking and necessitated the introduction of new banking legislation.<br>
