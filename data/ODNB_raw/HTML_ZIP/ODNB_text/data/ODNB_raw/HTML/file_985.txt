<span class="headword">Backhouse,  William</span>  (1593&#150;1662), <span class="occ">alchemist and antiquary</span>, was born on 17 January 1593, probably at Swallowfield, Berkshire, the youngest of the four sons of Samuel Backhouse (<i>d</i>. 1626), landowner, and his wife, Elisabeth (<i>d</i>. 1630), daughter of John Borlase of Little Marlow. Samuel had acquired Swallowfield in 1582. The family was of good standing in Berkshire and he was twice high sheriff (1598, 1601). In February 1611 William matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, but he took no degree. About 1637 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1663), daughter of Brian Richards of Hartley Westfield, Hampshire. They had three children: Samuel (died young), John  (1640&#150;1660), and Flower  (1641&#150;1700). Backhouse's three brothers all predeceased him and in 1649, on the death of the eldest, John, he inherited Swallowfield. About this time he engaged William Lloyd, the future bishop of St Asaph, as tutor to his children.<br>
<br>Backhouse's life was outwardly obscure and uneventful but contemporaries testify that he was a respected figure in a network of people involved in occult and philosophical studies: &#145;a most renown'd chymist, Rosicrucian, and a great encourager of those that studied chymistry and astrology&#146;  (Wood). The most informative of Backhouse's contacts is Elias Ashmole, who acquired an estate near Swallowfield in 1649. Ashmole's first reference to Backhouse is dated 3 April 1651: &#145;Mr: Will: Backhouse of Swallowfeild in Com Berks, caused me to call him Father thence forward&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1136, fol. 24<i>v</i>). The relationship between Backhouse and his alchemical heir during the early 1650s is celebrated by Ashmole in an ode and in notes of various alchemical conversations; for example, on 13 May 1653:<blockquote>My father Backhouse lying sick in Fleetestreete over against St: Dunstans Church, &amp; not knowing whether he should live or dye, about eleven a clock, told me in Silables the true Matter of the Philosophers Stone: which he bequeathed to me as a Legacy. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1136, fol. 29)</blockquote>Both Backhouse's heraldic crest&#151;an eagle holding in its claws a serpent&#151;and his personal motto &#145;Scache cache&#146; (archaic French, &#145;Know to conceal&#146;) were perfectly in tune with his character of secretive adept. He and his library of alchemical manuscripts greatly assisted Ashmole in the preparation of the latter's <span class="italic">Theatrum chemicum Britannicum</span> (1652).<br>
<br>Backhouse's learning extended to other fields. George Wharton, dedicating an almanac to Backhouse in 1653, refers to him as a master of astrology. His antiquarian interests are suggested both by the &#145;old deedes&#146; that Ashmole recorded as being in his possession  (7 Sept 1657; Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 833, p. 443) and by Aubrey's observation of Backhouse's habit of a summer tour of antique buildings. In 1660 Samuel Hartlib noted in his &#145;Ephemerides&#146; that Backhouse was &#145;a favourer of all manner of ingenuities&#146;, and that he possessed &#145;a long Gallery wherin are all manner of Inventions and Rarities&#146;  (Sheffield University, Hartlib MSS, <span class="roman">Ephemerides</span>, sect. 61, 3&#150;4). Given this interest in scientific instruments, Anthony Wood's statement that Backhouse invented the waywiser (later called the odometer) is not inherently unlikely, though more probably he improved an already existing instrument for measuring distances travelled by means of a device for counting the revolutions of a wheel.<br>
<br>Backhouse's only undoubted original composition is an alchemical poem, &#145;The Magistery&#146;, in Ashmole's <span class="italic">Theatrum chemicum Britannicum</span> (342&#150;3); it is signed W. B. (Ashmole expanded the initials in his own annotated copy of the <span class="italic">Theatrum</span>) and dated December 1633. Ashmole also explicitly ascribes two manuscript translations of alchemical texts to Backhouse: &#145;The pleasant founteine of knowledge &hellip; by John de la Founteine of Valencia in Henault&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 58, fols. 1&#150;23), a verse translation, dated 1644; and &#145;The golden fleece, or, The flower of treasures &hellip; by &hellip; Solomon Trismosin&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1395). Also in MS Ashmole 58, the verse translation of Jean de Meung's &#145;Planctus naturae: the complaint of nature against the erronious alchymist&#146;  (fols. 27&#150;48<i>v</i>) is in the same hand as &#145;The founteine of knowledge&#146;, as is the closely associated &#145;The alchimysts answere to nature&#146;  (fols. 50&#150;67); Anthony Wood ascribes the &#145;Planctus naturae&#146; to Backhouse, so the &#145;Answere&#146; is probably his too. The final translation in MS Ashmole 58, &#145;A treatise of the phillosophers stone &hellip; by Synesius the Greeke abbot&#146;  (fols. 72&#150;88<i>v</i>), may also be Backhouse's work.<br>
<br>Backhouse's daughter, Flower, became sole heir to the Swallowfield estate when her brother John died childless in 1660. She married three times: first, in 1656, to William Bishop; next, in 1662 after his death, to her cousin Sir William Backhouse of London, who also left her a widow; and finally, in 1670, to Henry Hyde, who in 1674 became second earl of Clarendon. William Backhouse died of a wasting fever on 30 May 1662 and was buried on 17 June in Swallowfield church.<br>
