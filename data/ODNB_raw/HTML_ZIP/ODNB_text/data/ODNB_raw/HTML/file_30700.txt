<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bellows,  John Thomas</span>  (1831&#150;1902), <span class="occ">printer, lexicographer, and archaeologist</span>, born at Carthew House, Church Street, Liskeard, Cornwall, on 18 January 1831, was the elder of the two sons of William Lamb Bellows (1798&#150;1877), schoolmaster, of Bere Regis, Dorset, and his wife, Hannah Stickland (1790&#150;1874), daughter of John Stickland, bailiff and Wesleyan preacher, of Eastholme, Wareham, Dorset. John's parents later became Quakers. John was educated at his father's school in Camborne until he was apprenticed, aged fourteen, to a local printer. At twenty he moved to Gloucester, working as a foreman printer until he started his own business.<br>
<br>In 1872, needing premises for his new steam printing press, Bellows developed a site at Eastgate, Gloucester, using the excavation as an opportunity for archaeological research. Against advice, he dug down, finding Roman pottery and a section of the Roman city wall. Later evidence confirmed his projected line of the entire city wall. He saved the &#145;Birdlip grave group&#146; and gave this, together with his collection of Samian and Roman fragments and coins, to Gloucester Museum. Malcolm Watkins, the city's archaeologist, called him &#145;a genuine pathfinder&#146;  (Charity, 118).<br>
<br>In January 1863 Bellows's Norwegian fianc&eacute;e was seriously ill. In <span class="italic">A Winter Journey from Gloucester to Norway</span> he describes his dangerous journey to her home in Arendal, unhappily arriving just after her death. The bulkiness of the Danish dictionary he used on his travels led to his creation of a French pocket dictionary: &#145;one cannot unpack a portmanteau for the sake of a word&#146;  (J. E. Bellows, 5).<br>
<br>For the next ten years Bellows worked unstintingly as a lexicographer while continuing his printing business. Professor Max M&uuml;ller, the philologist, helped him to produce his English <span class="italic">Outline Vocabulary for the Use of Students of the Chinese Language</span> (1868). He mastered the French language and with the aid of the Beljame brothers (Paris) produced the first French pocket dictionary in 1873, dedicated to the philologist Prince Lucien Bonaparte. The book contained 340,000 words, measured 4&frac34; &times; 2&frac34; inches, and was printed by hand in diamond type on specially thin paper; 6000 copies sold rapidly, and thirty reprints were made between 1915 and 1947. <span class="italic">The Times</span> called it &#145;a gem of typographical art&#146;  (J. E. Bellows, 6), and Mark Twain referred to it in &#145;The church of the gratis lesson&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1869 Bellows married Elizabeth Earnshaw (1841&#150;1932), daughter of Mark Earnshaw, surgeon, of Clitheroe, Lancashire. There were nine children, whose early lives are described in letters to his American friend and correspondent Oliver Wendell Holmes.<br>
<br>During the Franco-Prussian War (1870) Bellows spent one month as a commissioner for the Quakers, travelling the war zone on horseback, wagon, and foot, to assess the needs of the populace. He describes his journey in <span class="italic">The Track of the War around Metz</span>. Deeply committed to the Society of Friends, Bellows used their plain speech and wore Quaker dress to the end of his life. The austerity of this tall and distinguished figure was tempered by his warmth and irrepressible humour. His independence of mind and un-Quakerly views were expressed in his pamphlets.<br>
<br>In 1892, aged sixty, Bellows accompanied an Australian Friend to the Caucasus to aid a group of persecuted Russian pacifists. In Moscow the travellers visited Count Lev Tolstoy, who was sympathetic to their project. Bellows and Tolstoy formed a close friendship, corresponding for several years. The two Friends travelled into the mountains. Negotiating hazardous roads, and threatened by armed robbers, they reached the remote settlements of the Stundists and Dukhobors. &#145;Don't be uneasy on our account &hellip; we are under a higher protection than the police&#146;, John wrote to his wife  (<span class="italic">Letters and Memoir</span>, 178). On returning to Moscow, he and Tolstoy, with others, arranged for many Dukhobors to emigrate to Canada.<br>
<br>Despite further travels the business continued to thrive: Bellows was an inventive employer, too, producing Bellows's cylindrical rapid wages calculator, and a series of concentric calculators for metric conversion. In 1901 he made his final journey, to America, to receive an honorary degree of MA at Harvard, with the citation &#145;English Quaker, authority on Roman antiquities in Britain, delightful essayist and learned lexicographer&#146;. After returning home he developed heart failure and died of cardiac asthma at his country home, Upton Knoll, Upton St Leonards, Gloucestershire, on 5 May 1902. He was interred in Painswick burial-ground, Gloucestershire, on 9 May 1902.<br>
