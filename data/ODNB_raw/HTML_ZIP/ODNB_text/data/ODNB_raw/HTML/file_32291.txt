<span class="headword">Carlyle,  Alexander James</span>  (1861&#150;1943), <span class="occ">historian and social reformer</span>, was born in Bombay on 24 July 1861, the second of three children and younger son of the Revd James Edward Carlyle (1821&#150;1893), minister of the Free Church of Scotland in Bombay, and his wife, Jessie Margaret, daughter of James Milne of Huntly, Aberdeenshire. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32293/', "Sir Robert Warrand Carlyle")</script>. His father, who returned to Scotland when Alexander was a month old, was compelled for reasons of health to take charge of Presbyterian churches abroad, so that Alexander's boyhood was passed in Rome, Paris, Berlin, and South Africa. His knowledge of foreign languages and literature, and his enjoyment of foreign travel, were the outcome of this experience.<br>
<br>Carlyle had no regular schooling, and apart from two years at Glasgow University (1876&#150;8) his systematic studies began when in 1883 he entered Exeter College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner. He obtained a first-class in modern history in 1886 and a second-class in theology in 1888. In the latter year he was president of the Oxford Union and ordained to a curacy at St Stephen's, Westminster, where his sympathies as a social reformer were first aroused. He served as general secretary of the SPCK in 1890&#150;91. In 1893 he was elected to a fellowship at University College, Oxford; although he had to vacate his fellowship in 1895 on his marriage to Rebecca Monteith Smith (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of the Scottish poet and preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36166/', "Walter Chalmers Smith")</script>, he continued to serve the college as lecturer in politics and economics and as chaplain. In 1935 he was elected an honorary fellow.<br>
<br>From 1895 to 1919, however, Carlyle's centre in Oxford was the city church of St Martin and All Saints, of which he was rector. During these years he took a leading part, as a liberal thinker and Christian socialist formally attached to no political party, in the social life of the city and in religious movements. His friendship with Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other reformers, his co-operation with the high-church Anglicans associated with Charles Gore&#151;for whom, although he did not share his ecclesiastical and theological opinions, he had a deep regard&#151;and his close alliance with his old Exeter College friend John Carter testify to his breadth of outlook. He was one of the early advocates of planned social reform, the unity of the churches, and better-informed relations between the city and the university of Oxford. He was a mainstay of the Christian Social Union, which was largely sustained by disciples of Gore and Henry Scott Holland; a friend and adviser of local trade unionism; a promoter of interdenominational summer schools of theology, which for a number of years were held in Oxford; and he was in close touch with liberal leaders of religious life and thought abroad&#151;such as Lars Olof Jonathan (Nathan) S&ouml;derblom, archbishop of Uppsala&#151;as well as with men of such various outlook as Baron Friedrich von H&uuml;gel and the leaders in England of the free churches.<br>
<br>Carlyle's resignation of the living of the city church in 1919 enabled him to give more time to his work as writer and teacher. He had never neglected these interests and had owed much to the inspiration of William Sanday, whose seminars he attended, and to co-operation with Hastings Rashdall, whose theological views he largely shared. He had published a life of Hugh Latimer, with his wife, in 1899; an essay on the church in the composite volume <span class="italic">Contentio veritatis</span> (1902); the short books <span class="italic">The Influence of Christianity upon Social and Political Ideas</span> and <span class="italic">Wages</span> in 1912; and, with J. V. Bartlet, <span class="italic">Christianity in History</span> (1917).<br>
<br>Since 1895 Carlyle's main preoccupation had been his <span class="italic">History of Mediaeval Political Theory in the West</span>, which he had then planned with his elder brother. Although Sir Robert Carlyle was able to contribute only to the fifth volume of the book (1928)&#151;the volume on the thirteenth century, which represents more or less what in 1895 they had first thought to produce&#151;the two men discussed the work continuously, and the sixth and last volume (1936) was dedicated by Alexander to Robert's memory. As the work proceeded (1903&#150;36) it gradually won a high place in historical literature both on the continent and in the English-speaking world. Written with lucidity and with a simplicity that is apt to be misleading, it remains an invaluable guide to an immense series of texts ranging from the early Roman law books and the writings of the church fathers to the works of Bodin and Althusius. Its main theme is the rule of law, firmly rooted in the nature of things, as the basis of the search for and maintenance of justice and liberty. It was followed, in 1941, by <span class="italic">Political Liberty</span>, which was concerned with the seventeenth century. The Political Philosophy and Science Club, which Carlyle founded in 1909 primarily for teachers in the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London, was the practical expression of his wide political and social interests.<br>
<br>Apart from four years (1930&#150;34) as a canon of Worcester Cathedral, Carlyle lived continuously in Oxford from 1895 until his death. Throughout this period he was an active teacher and lecturer working for several colleges, including the women's colleges, as a tutor in history, economics, politics, and modern languages. His diversity of interests and his unconventional manner of speech provoked criticism in some quarters but his inspiration as a teacher and his influence upon many who in later life attained distinction are indisputable, and confirm the impression that his incisive and provocative table talk made on all who knew him. At different times he was the close and valued friend of such men as Rashdall, Sidney Ball, J. A. Smith, and H. H. Joachim. His home, where his wife and his two daughters supported him with an independent devotion, was a delightful social centre. He was an urbane, cultivated man who, though he rarely talked about it and was unclerical in demeanour, was in the words of one of his younger friends &#145;dominated by religion&#146;. As a curate in Westminster he was so much impressed by the evil social effects of intemperance that he became a total abstainer; but he never &#145;preached&#146;, although he was a good and forthright preacher, and was a living example to others by his belief that complete frankness and generous tolerance are not incompatible. In a word he expressed in action his belief in personal liberty.<br>
<br>Carlyle was in some ways more successful abroad than in England, whether in lecturing tours in Scandinavia or at juristic conferences in Rome. He gave the Olaus Petri lectures in Uppsala (1918) and the Lowell lectures in Boston (1924), as well as the Birkbeck lectures in ecclesiastical history at Trinity College, Cambridge (1925&#150;7). In 1936 he was elected FBA. He received the honorary degree of DD from Glasgow University (1934) and was a foreign member of the Royal Academy of Naples. He died in Oxford on 27 May 1943. His daughter made a bequest to the University of Oxford in 1972 that provides the Carlyle lectures on medieval political theory.<br>
