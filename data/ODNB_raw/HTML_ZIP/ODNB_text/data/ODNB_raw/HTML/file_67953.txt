<span class="headword">Ayleward,  Richard</span>  (1626&#150;1669), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born at Winchester, the son of Richard Ayleward, a minor canon at the cathedral. He sang there as a chorister under Christopher Gibbons in 1638 and 1639. Nothing is known of his whereabouts during the interregnum. At the Restoration he was appointed organist and master of the choristers at Norwich Cathedral (12 March 1661).<br>
<br>Ayleward wrote at least three services (the one in D is complete with responses and litany) and twenty-five anthems, including &#145;The king shall rejoice&#146; to mark the coronation of Charles II in 1661. All are preserved in a set of partbooks from Norwich Cathedral (now housed at King's College, Cambridge). Taken together they are remarkable, showing no obvious models in the music of the previous generation or similarities with that of his contemporaries&#151;other than perhaps George Jeffreys and Matthew Locke. Some of the anthems are on a large scale and make considerable demands on resources. Thus, &#145;I was glad&#146;, for example, is for three trebles, three countertenors, two tenors, and four basses, and &#145;Blow up the trumpet&#146;&#151;in some respects recalling Monteverdi or Carissimi&#151;would have taxed any cathedral choir in the land. Unusually, a number are set to poetic rather than biblical texts, and this suggests that they may have been written as devotional sacred music for some private household during the Commonwealth rather than the cathedral service after the Restoration. Among these is a cycle of four anthems, respectively for the nativity, circumcision, purification, and resurrection. Their metaphysical intensity suggests a poet such as Crashaw or Herbert; that on the circumcision (&#145;Gently, o gently, father, do not bruise&#146;) is actually by William Cartwright.<br>
<br>For some reason Ayleward relinquished his position both as organist and as choirmaster between mid-1664 and 5 December 1665; a cryptic reference in one of the chapter books to &#145;sending for Mr Ayleward at the Assizes&#146; in 1664 leaves one none the wiser. Following his reinstatement in 1665 he continued to serve until his death at Norwich on 15 October 1669. He was buried in the north aisle of Norwich Cathedral on 18 October.<br>
