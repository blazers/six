<span class="headword">Bagshaw,  Edward</span>  (1589/90&#150;1662), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born in London, the second son of the London vintner Edward Bagshaw, whose family originated in Derbyshire, and his wife, probably named Mary Heming. Bagshaw's father died in 1597, and his mother then married the prominent Northamptonshire lawyer Augustine Nicholls. Although 1584 was traditionally given as his date of birth, Bagshaw was said to be fifteen in 1605 when he matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was greatly influenced by his puritan tutor Robert Bolton. After proceeding BA in July 1608 Bagshaw was admitted to the Middle Temple and subsequently called to the bar in January 1616. His legal career prospered: in 1639 he was chosen a bencher of his inn, and that same year was appointed Lent reader. As his subject Bagshaw chose the medieval statute <span class="italic">Pro clero</span>, but his words attracted the attention of Archbishop Laud, who suspected a veiled attack upon the church. Despite Bagshaw's protestations, and his success in convincing Lord Keeper Finch of his sincerity, the readings were suspended after a threat of prosecution in the court of high commission.<br>
<br>Bagshaw sat for Southwark in the Long Parliament, in which he was a keen participant in ecclesiastical debates, condemning the canons of 1640 as <i>praemunire</i>, denouncing the <i>ex officio</i> oath, and complaining about the import of Catholic books. His eagerness to lard his speeches with details of ecclesiastical law and history was not always appreciated by his fellow MPs: D'Ewes described one as &#145;verie long, using discourse nothing pertinent to the matter in question&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Notestein, 425). An orthodox Calvinist, Bagshaw rejected the defence of episcopacy <i>jure divino</i>, blaming the current problems upon certain bishops who had &#145;perverted the ways of godlinesse&#146;  (E. Bagshaw, <span class="italic">A Speech &hellip; Concerning the Triall of the Twelve Bishops</span>, 1642). Yet he defended true episcopacy, arguing that presbyterianism was incompatible with the common law. Already critical of the Scots, as the political crisis worsened Bagshaw moved towards the king's camp: in November 1641 he joined Hyde in speaking against the grand remonstrance and eventually he abandoned Westminster for Charles's parliament at Oxford. In June 1644, however, he was captured as a traitor and incarcerated in the king's bench prison, where he devoted his time to writing.<br>
<br>During the 1630s Bagshaw completed a biography of Robert Bolton and edited a number of his works, and he later published many of his own parliamentary speeches, together with a defence of his aborted Lent readings. Bagshaw set out his royalist political views in <span class="italic">The Rights of the Crown of England, as it is Established by Law</span> (1660), drafted in prison in 1644 but not published until the Restoration. In it he maintained that the crown's powers derived from God, but were assented to by the laws of England. No absolutist, Bagshaw reflected upon the experience of the 1640s and struggled to reconcile his high regard for the common law with the acknowledged powers of the king, &#145;inasmuch as the safety of the one, is the safety of the other&#146;  (pp. 116&#150;17). In April 1645 he was released on bail, and soon thereafter returned to Northamptonshire, where he remained until his death in 1662 at Moreton Pinkney, where he was buried. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1044/', "Edward Bagshaw (1629/30&#150;1671)")</script>, a prominent nonconformist minister, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1045/', "Henry Bagshaw")</script>, a Church of England clergyman, were his sons.<br>
