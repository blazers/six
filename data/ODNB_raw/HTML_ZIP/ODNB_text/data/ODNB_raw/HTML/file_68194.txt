<span class="headword">Herbert, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1617), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the second son of Matthew Herbert of Swansea, gentleman, and Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Gamage of Coety in Glamorgan. Educated at Christ Church, Oxford, he graduated BA (5 July 1558), MA (12 December 1561), and BCL (9 February 1565). Despite the ruling (6 May 1570) that only advocates of the court of arches should be admitted to Doctors' Commons, Herbert was admitted exceptionally at Archbishop Parker's request (28 November 1573). Noted for his linguistic proficiency, he was employed to interrogate foreign prisoners (1574), was joint commissioner of the admiralty with David Lewis (1575&#150;84), and was master of requests from 1586 to 1601, with William Aubrey (1590&#150;95).<br>
<br>Herbert's linguistic gifts were also utilized on diplomatic missions to Denmark (1583, 1600, September 1602 to March 1603), Poland (between 1583 and 1585), Brandenburg (1585), and the Netherlands (1587). He sat in every parliament for a quarter of a century, representing Grampound, Cornwall (1586), Gatton, Surrey (1588&#150;9), Christchurch, Hampshire (1593), Bodmin, Cornwall (1597&#150;8), Glamorgan and Wallingford, Berkshire (1601), and Monmouthshire (1604&#150;11). A DCL (23 June 1587), he was chosen to dispute before Elizabeth I on her visit to Oxford of 1592. He was a JP for Glamorgan (1595), Hampshire (1604), and Montgomeryshire under James I.<br>
<br>Increasingly associated with the Cecils at court, Herbert accompanied Robert Cecil in 1598 on a mission to induce Henri IV of France not to conclude a separate peace with Spain. Although his role was supportive, on his return he became Cecil's secretary and confidant. A clerk to the privy council since 1590, he became a privy councillor in 1600, and obtained the novel position of second secretary of state, earning the jibe &#145;Mr. Secondary Herbert&#146;. From May to August 1600 he assisted the ambassador to France in negotiations with the Spaniards at Boulogne. He was nominally on the council of the north (1601&#150;4), and, having been knighted (31 January 1602), served on the council in the marches of Wales until his death. He participated in the trial of Sir Gelly Meyrick and others following the earl of Essex's revolt (1601).<br>
<br>On Elizabeth I's death Herbert was kept in office by James I and served as a commissioner for the Scottish union and for various ecclesiastical causes (1603&#150;6). With Cecil's elevation to the Lords, Herbert was left to defend royal policy in the Commons, for instance defending the king's financial needs in 1606, but he lacked the political acumen for the role. When Cecil died in 1610 his hopes of succeeding him as principal secretary of state were disappointed and he withdrew from public life, nominally retaining his positions.<br>
<br>Fluent in Welsh, Herbert kept his associations with Wales, marrying in 1591 Margaret, daughter of William Morgan of Pen-clawdd, Glamorgan, and leasing Neath Abbey from 1591 before purchasing it in 1599. They had one child, Mary, who married Sir William Doddington and had ten children. A devoted father, Herbert left court abruptly in 1602 to be with his seriously ill daughter. He inherited family property in Cardiff and Swansea on the death of his elder brother, William, without issue in 1609, and he owned land in fifteen different parts of Wales, as well as being involved in various commercial enterprises.<br>
<br>Appointed dean of Wells in 1590, Herbert sought to have a fellow civilian appointed chancellor, leading to a dispute with the canons. Like others of his family, he was at times unruly, once being reported to have broken the window of Thomas Basset's Cardiff house in retaliation for the latter having threatened him with a pistol. He is said to have gone abroad to fight a duel with Sir Lewis Tresham in May 1617 shortly before his death at Cardiff on 9 July, which may have resulted from the exertion or from injuries suffered. He was buried in the church of St John the Baptist, Cardiff, in a handsome tomb erected by his wife with full effigies of himself, in his lawyer's gown, and his brother William.<br>
