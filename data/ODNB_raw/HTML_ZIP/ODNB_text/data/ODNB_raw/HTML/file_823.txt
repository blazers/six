<span class="headword">Aston, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1590<span class="mult">x</span>93&#150;1649), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the younger son of Sir Arthur Aston (<i>d</i>. 1627), soldier, of Fulham, Middlesex, who was killed on the expedition to the &Icirc;le de Rh&eacute;, and his first wife, Christiana Ashton, daughter of John Ashton, of Penketh, Lancashire, and the grandson of Sir Thomas Aston, of Aston, Cheshire, in which county the Aston family had long flourished.<br>
<br>The younger son of a younger son, Aston was drawn early to military service abroad. With letters of recommendation from James I, he went, possibly with his father, to Russia about 1614, to serve the young tsar, Michael Romanov, against the Poles, and probably remained there until the Russo-Polish truce of 1618. After returning to England, Aston changed sides and was a captain in the force raised by King Sigismund III of Poland for service against the Turks (1621), an army of mainly Scottish and Irish troops, commanded by Aston's father. He witnessed the total defeat of the Ottoman army, and served under the Lithuanian general Radziwill, duke of Birze, against the Swedes, who had invaded Livonia. Aston commanded three companies of foot, and Radziwill praised his valour in a letter of 1 January 1623, especially in retaking the castle of Mittivia from the Swedes. Sigismund granted him a pension of 700 florins per annum on 23 April 1625, and in 1630 advanced him to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. A Swedish&#150;Polish truce led to Aston's again returning to England, with a commission from Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, dated 19 August 1631, to raise a regiment for his service. A privy council order on 14 December authorized Aston to levy up to 1200 men, the commission to begin in February 1632. He then joined the Swedish king in the L&uuml;tzen campaign (1632) and in February 1633 he was serving under the duke of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg at Hameln, near Hanover.<br>
<br>In 1639, with a number of other experienced soldiers, Aston returned to England and purchased an estate at Cattenhall, Cheshire, which, his widow was later to allege (25 June 1651), he conveyed in 1640 to his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/827/', "Sir Thomas Aston, bt")</script>, in trust for himself and any wife he should marry. On 8 April 1640 he was appointed by the earl of Northumberland sergeant-major-general of the regiments which, under Viscount Conway, were routed by the Scots at Newburn (28 August) in the second bishops' war. The earl of Strafford appointed him on 7 September colonel-general of one of the brigades serving against the Scots occupying Newcastle, and ten days later gave him command of the newly raised trained bands of Yorkshire. After the latter disbanded, he was discharged because of his being a Roman Catholic.<br>
<br>Aston was knighted on 15 February 1641, and on the outbreak of the civil war offered his services to the king, only to be rebuffed because of his Catholicism. When Fairfax allegedly accepted his tentative offer to fight for parliament, Prince Rupert appointed him, on 20 October 1642, sergeant-major-general of dragoons. At Edgehill, three days later, Aston, on the royalist left wing, beat off the parliamentary musketeers lining the hedges and ditches, clearing the way for Wilmot's advance. He was to succeed Wilmot in December as commissary (major)-general of horse.<br>
<br>On 29 October 1642 Aston was appointed governor of Reading. He complained bitterly about the lack of military qualities in the soldiers under his command. &#145;I do wish&#146;, he wrote to Rupert, his close confidant, &#145;that either I had some German soldiers to command or that I could find some German courage in them &hellip; I could never have a greater affliction light on me than to be put in command of them&#146;  (W. A. Day, ed., <span class="italic">The Pythouse Papers</span>, 1879, 12&#150;13). Reading was strategically situated on the main road from London to the west, and commanded passage of the River Thames; but it was poorly fortified and the garrison was short of ammunition. Over the winter of 1642&#150;3 Aston, bullying his soldiers and the citizenry alike, surrounded the town with ditches and embankments of earth, topped by blocks of stone from the nave of the abbey church, blown up for that very purpose. He hanged several of his unruly, dispirited garrison, and also one Boys, a citizen of London, for spying. So severe was his discipline over his 3300 troops during the siege of the town by the earl of Essex (15&#150;28 April 1643) that it was said to be more suited to &#145;ordering a loose Army in the Field, than in awing a regular Garrison in a Town&#146;  (Lloyd, 644). Three times Aston repelled Essex's assaults, but on 21 April he was struck on the head by a falling roof tile, dislodged by a stray parliamentary cannon shot; rendered speechless, he handed over command to his deputy, Colonel Fielding, who surrendered the town to Essex. Both Clarendon and modern historians have suggested that Aston's injury was more diplomatic than physical, and that it allowed him to avoid risking his reputation on the defence of such a vulnerable town. The Reading garrison was allowed safe passage, and Aston, in a horse litter, led the march out to Oxford, where he soon recovered his speech.<br>
<br>In July 1643 Aston was Rupert's major-general of horse at the siege of Bristol, commanding the right wing and aiding Belasyse in his attack on Frome Gate. Clarendon says that Rupert initially intended Aston to be governor of Bristol, before deciding instead to appoint Hopton to the post. At the first battle of Newbury (20 September 1643) Aston had his horse killed beneath him. Meanwhile, on 23 August he had succeeded Sir William Pennyman as governor of Oxford. His appointment was allegedly influenced by the queen, who felt safer with a Catholic in command. Anthony Wood described him as &#145;a testy, froward, imperious and tirannical person, hated in Oxon and elsewhere by God and man&#146;  (Clark, 1.110). On 22 December Aston was wounded in the side in a nocturnal street scuffle; in February 1644 he was reportedly confined to his chamber for beating the mayor. The garrison certainly resented the severity of his discipline, and a parliamentary scout reported on 11 April that his relations with the citizens over completion of the fortifications were so bad that he begged the king to evacuate the whole civilian population. Yet, on 1 May the university, rather incongruously, awarded him a doctorate in medicine. Then on 19 September he had the misfortune to break his leg in a riding accident, which his enemies ascribed to &#145;kervetting on horseback on Bullington Green before certaine ladies&#146;  (Clark, 1.110). Gangrene set in, the leg was amputated (on 7 December), and Aston was replaced as governor on 25 December by his deputy, Sir Henry Gage, a fellow Catholic. He was given a pension by the king of &pound;1000 per annum. Aston disliked Gage, especially after his successful relief of Basing House, a task Aston had earlier declined. While protesting that his own low-key practice of Catholicism gave no scandal to protestants, he launched a bizarre verbal assault on Gage, accusing him of being a Jesuit stooge who attended Catholic sermons (a more serious offence than merely attending mass). Gage's telling riposte alleged that he had merely been entrapped into presence at a single such sermon, at the house of Aston's own daughter, Elizabeth (who had been born in Russia). When Gage was killed in January 1645 in an attempt to capture Abingdon, Aston, strutting around on his wooden leg, hoped to be reappointed as governor, and he was furious when Rupert instead nominated his loyal supporter William Legge.<br>
<br>By November 1646 Aston was with Ormond in Ireland. He may have arrived there earlier, since a letter from Rupert to Ormond of 30 June 1645 extolled his meritorious service. It was possibly at this time that he married Ellinor White, daughter of Charles White of Leixlip, Ireland. They had a son, Samuel, who in 1650 successfully applied for the diversion of part of Aston's sequestered estate at Cattenhall, purchased by Colonel Gilbert Gerard, for the use of himself and his sisters. The <span class="italic">Lords' Journals</span> report that Aston was given a pass to go overseas on 4 January 1647 (he had requested either leave to return to England or such a pass), and he may have accompanied Ormond to France in 1648. On 24 August 1649 Ormond, now returned, appointed him governor of Drogheda, a strategic town dominating the mouth of the River Boyne, and well protected by a wall some 20 feet high, punctuated by twenty-nine guard towers. Aston boasted that anyone who could take Drogheda could capture hell itself, but he had few cannon and was faced by a superior besieging army of 12,000 men under Cromwell himself. On 8 September he told Ormond that his ammunition and provisions were running short. The harbour was blockaded, most of his 3000 troops were demoralized Irish Catholics, who deserted daily, and there was a plot to betray the town to Cromwell, led by Aston's own grandmother Lady Wilmot, whom he threatened to turn into powder. On 10 September Aston rejected Cromwell's summons to surrender, and overnight threw up a triple line of interior earthworks. On the 11th a steady English cannonade breached the walls, and Aston and 300 of the garrison climbed the Mill Mount, where, after Cromwell personally forbade any quarter, Aston was hacked to pieces and had his brains beaten out with his own wooden leg, thought by the besiegers to contain gold pieces; 200 were later found in his belt.<br>
<br>Aston was clearly a stern, peppery, and vindictive professional soldier with pronounced conceit. Clarendon, who opposed the grant of commissions to Catholics as politically injurious to the royalist cause yet was strangely sceptical about Aston's own Catholicism, was more intemperate, describing him as a rough, untrustworthy, money-grabbing lecher. Yet even Clarendon admitted that in 1643 &#145;there was not in [the royal] army an officer of greater reputation, and of whom the enemy had a greater dread&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.17), even if the ruthlessness he learned abroad made him &#145;very much esteemed where he was not known, and very much disliked where he was&#146;  (ibid., 3.406). And it is clear that his indomitable spirit, shown especially at Drogheda, could inspire his troops. Like Montrose, the royalist memorialist David Lloyd reported, he &#145;had one excellent faculty, that in extremity he had some operative Phrases, wherewith he could bespeak his Souldiers to do wonders&#146;  (Lloyd, 645).<br>
