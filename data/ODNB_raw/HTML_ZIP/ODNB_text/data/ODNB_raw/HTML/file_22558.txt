<span class="headword">Porteous,  William</span>  (1735&#150;1812), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 11 March 1735, the eldest surviving child of James Porteous (1701&#150;1780) of Dalveich, minister of Monzievaird and Strowan, Perthshire, and his first wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haley (<i>d</i>. 1738). He matriculated at the University of Glasgow and, after training for the ministry there, was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Auchterarder on 13 September 1757. In November 1759 he was presented by Lady Mary Cunninghame to the parish of Whitburn in Linlithgowshire, and was ordained there on 10 June 1760. On 26 August he married Grizel Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1774), the daughter of the Revd George Lindsay of North Leith; they had three sons and a daughter. He was translated to the Old Wynd or West Parish Church, Glasgow, on 28 June 1770 and remained a minister of that parish for forty-two years, the last five of them at the newly constructed St George's Church. His wife having died four years after the move to Glasgow, he married, on 8 August 1785, Marion Moore (<i>d</i>. 1817), daughter of the Revd Charles Moore of Stirling and sister of the novelist and travel writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19130/', "John Moore (1729&#150;1802)")</script>.<br>
<br>After his move to Glasgow, Porteous was a leader of the popular or orthodox party in the west of Scotland. His piety was praised in a poem by the Revd Alexander Cunningham, dated 30 June 1778 and published in Glasgow the following year in his <span class="italic">Poems on the British Authors</span>. In December 1778 Porteous published a fast day sermon, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Toleration, Applied to the Present Times</span>, which accepted the principle of toleration in general but argued warmly against its extension to Roman Catholics at a time when that measure was under consideration by the government. In 1782 he sponsored an alternative reply to the king from the general assembly of the Church of Scotland which praised the appointment of the new (Rockingham) ministry and intimated opposition to the British government's handling of the American War of Independence; the measure was defeated in a party vote, 86 to 49, but Porteous was among those entering a dissent affirming the church's right to speak out against government policies harmful to the social welfare. His connection with America was enhanced by his personal ties with John Witherspoon, the president of the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), which granted him an honorary DD degree in November 1784.<br>
<br>In Glasgow, Porteous fought unsuccessfully to block the opening of John Jackson's Dunlop Street Theatre in 1782 and took an active part in the administration of social relief programmes. His <span class="italic">Letter to the Citizens of Glasgow</span> (1783) contains detailed tables of the town's parishes and their poor, listed by name and occupation, and begins with this memorable exhortation: &#145;The poor of the city are <i>your</i> poor, and it is your <i>duty</i> to make provision for them.&#146; Yet Porteous was so rigorous in investigating claims for relief at the town's hospital that he was popularly known as &#145;Buff (a Scots word for &#147;Beat&#148;) the Beggars&#146;  (Addison, 51). Like most of his colleagues in the popular party he turned sharply against the French Revolution, as evidenced by the two fast day discourses he delivered on 18 April 1793 and published soon afterwards as <span class="italic">The Good Old Way Recommended</span>. At the end of the century he attacked aspects of the doctrine and practice of a branch of presbyterian seceders in <span class="italic">The New Light examined, or, Observations on the proceedings of the Associate Synod against their own standards</span> (1800), which provoked a critical pamphlet from James Peddie in the same year. In 1807&#150;8 Porteous became embroiled in a controversy over the introduction of organs in public worship, which he strongly opposed. He died on 12 January 1812.<br>
