<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Toynbee,  Joseph</span>  (1815&#150;1866), <span class="occ">ear surgeon</span>, was born at Heckington, Lincolnshire, on 30 December 1815, the second son of George Toynbee, a landowner and large tenant farmer. Educated at King's Lynn grammar school, at the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to William Wade of the Westminster General Dispensary in Gerrard Street, Soho, London. He studied anatomy under George Derby Dermott at the Great Windmill Street school of medicine, and gained a reputation for dissection. He subsequently studied at St George's and University College hospitals, and was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, in 1838. Study of the ear attracted him even during his student life. He was spurred on by the activity of the &#145;aurists&#146;, among whom was John Harrison Curtis, whose claim that one of the commonest causes of deafness was a deficiency of cerumen caused him to take issue in correspondence to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1838 under the initials &#145;J. T.&#146;. In the same year he gained an appointment at the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons under Richard Owen. Among his research activities, using the microscope, was a paper entitled &#145;On the non-vascularity of articular cartilage, the cornea, crystalline lens and vitreous humour, and of the epidermoid appendages&#146;, which secured him election to the Royal Society in 1842 at the age of twenty-six. He was appointed in 1843 as surgeon to the St George's and St James's Dispensary and later in the year was elected one of the first fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.<br>
<br>Toynbee realized that the failure to study pathology was the main reason for the disrepute into which aural surgery had fallen, and that the only rational approach to the understanding and treatment of aural disease lay in dissection of temporal bones. Over a period of twenty years he amassed a collection of over 2000 specimens, many of which came as a result of appointments as aural surgeon to the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in the Old Kent Road, and to the Asylum for Idiots at Earlswood, Surrey, and others which were derived from patients he had examined. In 1857 he published <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of Preparations Illustrative of the Diseases of the Ear in the Museum of Joseph Toynbee</span>. The collection attracted the young Adam Politzer (1835&#150;1920) and was viewed by many, including Anton von Tr&ouml;ltsch (1829&#150;1890). On Toynbee's death the collection was given to the Hunterian Museum, but was destroyed in the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1853 Toynbee invented his artificial tympanic membrane, which consisted of a disc of gutta-percha to which was attached a fine silver wire; he published his results in a book entitled <span class="italic">On the Use of Artificial Membrana tympani in Cases of Deafness</span>. There was some rivalry between Toynbee and James Yearsley over the various merits of their respective artificial eardrums. Toynbee's <span class="italic">Diseases of the Ear: their Nature, Diagnosis and Treatment</span> (1860) was the most advanced and comprehensive textbook of its kind. It was dedicated to the governors of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, who in 1851 had had the foresight to appoint him as aural surgeon and to set aside the first beds in a general hospital for diseases of the ear. He resigned from this appointment in 1864. Toynbee noted that the Eustachian tube opened only in swallowing and yawning, and blew air up the tube with a catheter. He practised myringotomy and described osteomata, &#145;molluscous&#146; tumour (cholesteatoma) and ankylosis of the stapes, which he incorrectly attributed to a &#145;rheumatic arthritis&#146;. This was later shown by Politzer to be due to otosclerosis. He recognized intracranial spread of otogenic infection, but did not perform mastoidectomy.<br>
<br>Initially living at 12 Argyll Place, St James's, Toynbee moved in 1850 to 18 Savile Row and there conducted a very successful practice. In 1854 he took a country house at Parkside, Wimbledon. Much of his life was devoted to philanthropic work. He started a Samaritan Fund to assist the sick poor of Wimbledon and later a Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Working Classes. In Wimbledon he endowed a village hall and a small museum and published <span class="italic">Hints on the Formation of Local Museums</span> (1863) and <span class="italic">Wimbledon Museum Notes</span>. A fountain erected to the memory of Joseph Toynbee by the Working Men's Club still stands. He married, on 4 August 1846, Harriet, daughter of Nathaniel Reynolds Holmes and niece of the antiquary John Holmes; together they had nine children. Their second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27646/', "Arnold Toynbee (1852&#150;1883)")</script>, shared his father's interest in social welfare and devoted his short life to it. Two years after Arnold Toynbee's death the first University Settlement was founded in Whitechapel by Canon Barnett, and was named Toynbee Hall. The third of the Toynbees' four sons was the Dante scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36545/', "Paget Jackson Toynbee (1855&#150;1932)")</script>; their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62321/', "Grace Coleridge Frankland")</script> was a bacteriologist.<br>
<br>Joseph Toynbee's life was described by his daughter Gertrude in her books <span class="italic">Joseph Toynbee</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Reminiscences and Letters of Joseph and Arnold Toynbee</span> (1910) as outwardly quiet, uneventful, and hard-working. His inner life, though, showed intensity of love and sympathy, lofty idealism, undying trust, and aspiration. He had a fine bearing and gracious manners and to his children was father, mother, brother, friend, and teacher all in one. Toynbee was devoted to Gothic and Norman architecture and to literature, particularly that of William Wordsworth, John Ruskin, and Samuel Coleridge. He also collected watercolours, especially those of D. G. Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, James Holland, and Samuel Palmer&#151;most of whom were his friends. Botanical specimens prepared by him are still in the Kew Gardens collection. Toynbee's secret was not to encumber himself with petty worries but to be free to absorb new experiences and to seek the truth.<br>
<br>Toynbee died at his home in Savile Row on 7 July 1866 as he had lived&#151;enquiring. Believing that tinnitus might be relieved by the inhalation of the vapours of hydrocyanic acid and chloroform, with a subsequent Valsalva insufflation, he fatally subjected himself to the test. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Wimbledon, and at the time of his death was president of the Quekett Microscopical Society and treasurer of the Medical Benevolent Fund. He was survived by his wife.<br>
