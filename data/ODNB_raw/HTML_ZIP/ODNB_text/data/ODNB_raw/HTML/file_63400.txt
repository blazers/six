<span class="headword">Lincoln family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1100&#150;<em>c.</em>1280), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, held extensive lands in Dorset and neighbouring counties in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The family may have been descended from <a name="cosubject_63398"></a><span class="headword">Alfred [i]  of Lincoln</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1110)<span class="occ"></span>. In 1086 this man, possibly of Breton origin, held land in Thoresway, Lincolnshire, and it was probably the same man who then claimed half a hide of land in Wymington, Bedfordshire. The first member of the Dorset branch of the family was <a name="cosubject_63399"></a><span class="headword">Alfred [ii]  of Lincoln</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1130)<span class="occ"></span>. He was also known as Alfred de Nichol, that name being an old French form of Lincoln. He seems to have been the second husband of a Domesday tenant, the widow of Hugh fitz Grip, a former sheriff of Dorset, and he acquired nearly all his wife's lands in the county; these lands were mostly located in the eastern hundreds of Dorset and included land held from Glastonbury Abbey. The feodary of the abbey includes a list of the lands, which in 1086 were held by the widow and then later by the Lincolns and included Duntish and &#145;Hermyngswell&#146; in Buckland (Buckland Newton), Woodyates and Okeford Fitzpaine in Dorset, and Damerham in Hampshire. The Lincolns also held Colway, probably the manor of Lym, on the border of Devon and Dorset, and Sturminster Newton in Dorset from Glastonbury Abbey at a later date. It may have been Alfred [ii] who witnessed a charter of William II in 1091, and he served as a county justice in Dorset in the reign of Henry I. He witnessed over a dozen royal charters in the period <i>c</i>.1100&#150;22 although he may not have been a member of the royal court. He was a patron of Montacute Priory in Somerset to which he gave &#145;Brigam&#146; near Weymouth (part of his wife's estate in 1086). He was still living in 1130 when he paid 60 marks to have Pulham manor for his lifetime.<br>
<br>Alfred's son <a name="cosubject_63400"></a><span class="headword">Robert  of Lincoln</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1156)<span class="occ"></span> presumably succeeded to all his father's estates. His possessions are recorded as including land at Worth Matravers, Langton (either Langton Herring or Langton Matravers), Cheselbourne, and probably Winterborne St Martin. Robert founded the Cluniac priory of Holme as a cell of Montacute Priory in the mid-twelfth century. His foundation grant included land at Holme which his father had bought from Grimbald the Physician before 1107. The endowment also comprised three virgates in Worth Matravers, the tithes of Langton (Herring) and Okeford Fitzpaine, and one tribute of salt from the salt-cotes at Langton (probably Langton Matravers). Robert was married to a certain Beuza and their son <a name="cosubject_63401"></a><span class="headword">Alfred [iii]  of Lincoln</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1198)<span class="occ"></span> confirmed his father's grant to Holme. In addition he also gave to the priory the church of Warmwell, a garden near Bradle, and land at Plush with the right to pasture 10 oxen, 1 heifer, and 250 sheep with the abbot of Glastonbury's cattle. Alfred [iii] was married to Albereda and is first mentioned in the early years of Henry II's reign. In 1166 he returned a <i>carta</i> which recorded that he held twenty-five fees of the old enfeoffment and four fees and eighty parts of fees of the new enfeoffment. Following the inquest of sheriffs in 1170 he was appointed sheriff of Dorset.<br>
<br>In the early thirteenth century Alfred [iii]'s son <a name="cosubject_63402"></a><span class="headword">Alfred [iv]  of Lincoln</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1240)<span class="occ"></span> was recorded as holding twenty-four and a half fees in Dorset and Somerset. These included lands at Langton (Herring or Matravers), Tatton, Lyme, and Buckland Newton. Alfred acted as a royal justice in Dorset in the 1220s and early 1230s, and in 1230 he was granted protection while he was overseas on the king's service. He married Maud and was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_63403"></a><span class="headword">Alfred [v]  of Lincoln</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1264)<span class="occ"></span>, who was charged a relief of &pound;100 in 1240. This Alfred was also active in the service of Henry III. In the mid-thirteenth century he was acting as a royal justice in Dorset and Wiltshire. He was commissioned with others to investigate the condition of royal castles in Somerset and Dorset, and also to inquire into &#145;excesses, trespasses and injuries&#146; in Dorset. In 1242 he was granted protection while on the king's service overseas, and between 1258 and 1263 he was summoned to take part in several royal expeditions to Wales. Alfred [v] died without a male heir and his estates were divided between his sisters Beatrice de Gouiz (<i>d</i>. before 1278) and Aubreye of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1277), and Robert Fitzpain (<i>d</i>. 1281), the son of his eldest sister, Margery (<i>d</i>. after 1245), who married Roger Fitzpain. Beatrice and her son William inherited four fees and one-fifth of a knight's fee in Dorset and land at Norton in Somerset; Aubrey's share included over three knights' fees in Dorset at Warmwell, &#145;Muleburn&#146;, &#145;Lollebrook&#146;, and &#145;Stafford&#146;; Robert's share included livery of the manor and advowson of Winterbourne St Martin, the manor of Langton (probably Langton Herring), and the manors and advowsons of Akeford and Duntish chapel. Alfred's widow, Joan, held almost six knights' fees in dower including land in &#145;Ringstead&#146;, &#145;Frome Wytefield&#146;, and Watercombe. She later married William de Molum, a king's yeoman, the marriage being his reward for service to Henry III and Queen Eleanor.<br>
