<span class="headword">Arrol, Sir  William</span>  (1839&#150;1913), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Houston, Renfrewshire, on 13 February 1839, the son of Thomas Arrol, cotton spinner, and his wife, Agnes Hodgart, sister of Matthew Hodgart, a mechanical engineer in Paisley and partner in the firm of Fullerton Hodgart and Barclay. Shortly afterwards the family moved to the nearby textile town of Johnstone where at the age of nine William was sent to work as a piecer in a local cotton mill. In 1850 Thomas Arrol became manager of one of the thread mills of J. and P. Coats in Paisley where William was employed as a wooden bobbin maker until he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to Thomas Reid, a local blacksmith. After completing his time he worked as journeyman in different parts of England, returning to Scotland in the early 1860s to work for the Paisley engineering firm of Blackmore and Gordon. He was appointed foreman of the boilershop of R. Laidlaw, gas engineers in Glasgow, in 1863, and the following year married Elizabeth, daughter of David Pattison, a Paisley mill mechanic.<br>
<br>During 1868 Arrol started his own boiler-making business with premises in Peel Street, Glasgow, trading as William Arrol &amp; Co. In 1871 he built the Dalmarnock iron works and shortly afterwards diversified into bridge building and public works contracting, winning a number of contracts from the Edinburgh suburban railway. His first major contract, in 1875/6, was for the Bothwell Viaduct (727 feet long) to carry the Hamilton and Bothwell branch of the North British Railway over the Clyde. In carrying out this contract Arrol devised a novel method of projecting the continuous girders across the river from pier to pier on rollers driven by ratchet bars. This success made him the natural choice later in 1876 for the Caledonian Railway contract to build the viaduct across the Clyde into Glasgow's new Central Station. For the construction of this massive bridge Arrol invented special drilling machines and hydraulic riveting equipment.<br>
<br>Before the viaduct was completed in October 1878 Arrol had won the prestigious commission to build a railway bridge across the Firth of Forth designed by Sir Thomas Bouch. When Bouch's Tay Bridge collapsed in December 1879 the contract was cancelled while new designs using a cantilever and straw stick system of construction were prepared by John Fowler and Benjamin Baker. In 1882 Arrol was awarded the contracts for both the Forth Bridge and the replacement Tay Bridge, designed by William Henry Barlow. The contract for the Forth Bridge, worth more than &pound;3 million, was for a steel rather than a wrought-iron bridge. In order to make up the huge tubular supports, Arrol designed with the help of his cousin Matthew Hodgart complex drilling and riveting machines. He overcame the problem of building in a fast-flowing river by using a system of pontoons for sinking caissons. Model sections of the bridge were tested by Arrol on Fowler's highland estate near Ullapool. His industry during these contracts was formidable, getting up at four nearly every morning, supervising the production of the sections at the Dalmarnock works, visiting both sites every week, and meeting the consulting engineers in London every Thursday. The contracting work at Queensferry on the Forth was entrusted to a new company, Tancred Arrol &amp; Co. The new Tay Bridge was opened in 1887 and the Forth Bridge in 1890. At the inauguration ceremony performed by the prince of Wales, it was announced that Arrol had been knighted. The bridge was soon acknowledged as one of the modern wonders of the world, attracting crowds of visitors.<br>
<br>By the mid-1880s Arrol had won major contracts outside Scotland, for Tower Bridge in London (1886&#150;94) and for the viaduct over the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales. Over the next twenty years the firm, which was converted into a limited liability company in 1895 as Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. Ltd, was recognized as the leading bridge builders in Britain. Contracts included the second section of the bridge over the Clyde at Central Station (1901&#150;6), the Nile Bridge at Cairo (1904&#150;8), the Redheugh high level bridge at Newcastle, twelve of the largest bridges on the Manchester Ship Canal, and the Wear Bridge at Sunderland (1905&#150;9).<br>
<br>Arrol's structural engineering skills also won him contracts for light steel roofs and whole workshops. In 1887 he built his first roof, for the smithy at Dubs locomotive works in Glasgow. Other business quickly followed until his company became one of the most important builders of engineering workshops in the country. Contracts included the Parsons marine steam turbine works at Wallsend-on-Tyne (1895&#150;7), massive engine and boiler shops for William Beardmore's Dalmuir naval construction works (1902&#150;5) and the gigantic Coventry Ordnance in Glasgow (1910). By the First World War, there was hardly a shipyard or engineering works in Scotland, the north of England, and Ireland that Arrol had not done work for.<br>
<br>Arrol's knowledge of hydraulic engineering led him to manufacture hydraulic riveting machines, together with their associated engines and accumulators. He combined his hydraulic and structural skills to build massive gantries over shipbuilding berths at Beardmore's Dalmuir yard and Harland and Wolff's Queen's Island yard in Belfast. These complex structures were equipped with lifts and jib cranes to carry hydraulic riveting machines. Benefiting from his early experience in gas engineering he invented in collaboration with William Foulis, the Glasgow corporation gas engineer, machines for charging, discharging, and cleaning retorts. These were supplied to gas companies throughout the United Kingdom. Arrol's skill as a businessman and his likeable character earned him a seat on the board of J. and P. Coats when it became a public company in 1890 and on that of Union Castle Steamship Company when the merged company was formed in 1900. He was also a special director of the Glasgow-based Union Bank of Scotland and a director of the steelmakers Stewarts and Lloyd.<br>
<br>Arrol was a Liberal Unionist in his early life, but left the party in 1886 with other Unionists over the Irish home rule question. He became a passionate opponent of home rule, standing as Unionist candidate in South Ayrshire in 1892 and winning the seat in 1895. He stood down as an MP in 1906. He was not an active parliamentarian, attending the Commons only infrequently and only speaking four times in his whole career on minor issues. He made his home at Seafield House in Ayr from 1885, where he became an enthusiastic gardener and picture collector. His first wife died in 1904 and in 1905 he married his first cousin Janet Hodgart. She died on 2 January 1910 and on 16 November of that year he married Elsie, daughter of James Robertson of London. He died on 20 February 1913, at Seafield. He had no children.<br>
