<span class="headword">Askew <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Kyme]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1521&#150;1546), <span class="occ">writer and protestant martyr</span>, was probably born at her family home in Stallingborough, near Grimsby in Lincolnshire, the second daughter of Sir William Askew (1489&#150;1541) and his first wife, Elizabeth Wrottesley. She had two brothers, Francis and Edward, and two sisters, Martha and Jane. Her father, who was a landowner in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, was knighted in 1513, and in 1521, at about the time of Anne's birth, he was appointed high sheriff of Lincolnshire. He also sat as MP for Grimsby in 1529, and perhaps later. After the death of his first wife he married twice more and had two more sons, Christopher and Thomas. Perhaps by 1523 the family had moved to South Kelsey, about 20 miles from Lincoln.<h2>
<a name="LincolnshiretoLondon"></a>Lincolnshire to London</h2>Anne Askew is generally thought to have received a good education, possibly from tutors at home. Her marriage and conversion to protestantism are described by the reformist scholar John Bale, who published her writings posthumously. In spite of a tendency to editorial intervention in his treatment of her literary remains, he is a basically trustworthy source for her life. He states that Sir William negotiated a match between his eldest daughter and one &#145;mastre Kyme&#146;, the son and heir of a neighbouring farmer  (<span class="italic">Examinations</span>, 92). This Master Kyme can be identified as one of two men, both called Thomas, and both of Friskney: one was born <i>c</i>.1517, the other died in 1590. Unfortunately Martha died before the wedding to Thomas Kyme could take place, and rather than suffer any financial loss, William Askew offered Anne as a replacement, &#145;so that in the ende she was compelled agaynst her wyll or fre consent to marrye with hym&#146;  (ibid.). The couple had two children, and, as Bale puts it, Askew &#145;demeaned her selfe lyke a Christen wyfe&#146;  (ibid.). However, &#145;in processe of tyme by oft readynge of the sacred <span class="roman">Bible</span>, she fell clerelye from all olde superstycyons of papystrye, to a perfyght beleve in Jhesus Christ&#146;  (ibid., 93). Askew's enthusiasm initially brought her to the attention of members of the established church in her own locality, and she herself describes the hostility which it generated: &#145;For my fryndes tolde me, if I ded come to Lyncolne, the prestes wolde assault me and put me to great trouble, as therof they had made their boast&#146;  (ibid., 56). In response to this challenge, Askew travelled to the city, and stayed there for six days or more. As she sat reading her <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the cathedral, she was approached by small groups of clerics. Only one man actually confronted her, and she asserted that his words were of so little import that she could not remember them. Bale claims that this episode so infuriated her religiously orthodox husband that he &#145;vyolentlye drove her oute of hyse howse&#146;  (ibid., 93), and that, having been forced to leave her husband, she quite legitimately sought a divorce. Writing over half a century later, the recusant propagandist Robert Persons gives a more negative account of her activities, representing her as leaving her spouse in order &#145;to gad up and downe the countrey a ghospelling and ghossipinge where she might and ought not. And this for divers yeares before her imprisonment; but especially she delighted to be in London neere the court&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Narratives</span>, 309).<br>
<br>Susan Brigden dates Anne Askew's arrival in the capital to late in 1544, and argues that she hoped to obtain a legal separation in chancery. Askew already had family connections with the royal household: her brother Edward was cup-bearer to the king, and her half-brother Christopher, who had died the previous year, had been a gentleman of the privy chamber. Some of her siblings may have been sympathizers with the new religion. Before he entered the royal household Edward had been in the service of Archbishop Cranmer; however, it is likely that he owed his position there simply to the archbishop's Lincolnshire connections, and of arguably greater significance is the marriage of Anne's sister Jane to George St Poll, a lawyer in the service of the duke and duchess of Suffolk. Anne Askew's own connection with the duchess was to be one which her interrogators were keen to establish when they examined and tortured her in 1546. Jane later married the protestant Richard Disney. Other important members of Askew's social network were her religious adviser John Lascels, the chronicler Edward Hall, and her cousin Christopher Brittayn. All these men were lawyers in the inns of court, but a number of her associates were of the artisan class, including the Kentish Anabaptist Joan Bocher (executed 1550), who came from a family of rural craftsmen, and who was described by Persons as Askew's &#145;dear sister, disciple, and handmayd&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Narratives</span>, 309).<h2>
<a name="Thefirstexamination"></a>The first examination</h2>In 1544 or 1545, &#145;one great papiste of Wykam [Winchester] colledge, then called Wadloe&#146;, moved into a house near Anne Askew's lodgings in the Temple in order to spy on her activities, and noted that &#145;at mydnyght she begynneth to pray, and cessyth not in many howers after, when I and others applye owr sleape or do worse&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Narratives</span>, 40). Although Wadlow found nothing sinister to report back to his master in chancery, Sir Thomas Wriothesley, and was indeed impressed by her piety, Askew was soon brought before the authorities and forced to endure a two-year period of persecution. In a version of her life written by her nephew Edward Ayscu, she was even forced into hiding for a time, before being betrayed to her opponents by a close relative. The exact order of the events which lead up to her execution is unclear. Askew herself, in her autobiographical account of her trials, dates her first examination to &#145;the yeare of oure Lorde M.D.xlv and in the moneth of Marche&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examinations</span>, 19). While it might be assumed that she is using the old style calendar (in other words, referring to events now dated to 1546), contemporary records confirm that the aldermen of London ordered her to be detained under the <span class="roman">Six Articles Act</span> on 10 March 1545. On the testimony of an unnamed woman, Askew was brought before the quest (an official heresy hearing in front of a commission) at Sadler's Hall before being cross-examined by the lord mayor of London and the chancellor of the bishop of London, Edmund Bonner. She was then imprisoned in the Counter for twelve days, where she refused to be shriven except by reformist priests, before her cousin Brittayn was allowed to visit her and to begin negotiations concerning bail. Having been interrogated further, this time by Bonner himself and his archdeacon John Wymesley, she was questioned about a book which she was carrying, written by John Frith, who was burnt for heresy in 1533, and accused of subscribing to reformist beliefs concerning transubstantiation and the other sacraments and the dominion of the priesthood. Whether she retracted her beliefs or not is open to debate. Askew acknowledged putting her name to a confession of faith, but the one preserved in the diocesan records (GL, MS 9531/12, fol. 109) does not include her own addenda, &#145;I, Anne Askewe do beleve all maner thynges contayned in the faythe of the Catholyck churche&#146;, as recorded in her printed <span class="italic">Examinations</span>  (<span class="italic">Examinations</span>, 62). John Foxe interpreted the discrepancy as just one more example of Bonner's corruption. Her friends&#151;Brittayn and Hall, together with Hugh Weston and Francis Spilman&#151;interceded on her behalf and negotiated her release on bail.<br>
<br>It would appear that at this stage Bonner was concerned more about the heterodoxy of Askew's beliefs than with her connections and contacts, and that he principally wanted to rid himself of a woman whom he found obstinate and vexatious. Her treatment during her first examination suggests, therefore, that Askew's opponents did not yet view her as particularly influential or important. None the less, she did not remain in the clear for long. Charles Wriothesley's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> notes that she was arraigned in the Guildhall on 13 June 1545, along with two others named Joan Sawtrey and Robert Lukine (a servant of Sir Humphrey Browne). All three were accused of speaking against the sacrament of the altar. But when the only witness to appear against them was judged unreliable, they were released.<h2>
<a name="Thesecondexamination"></a>The second examination</h2>By the summer of 1546 the authorities had clearly begun to take Anne Askew's activities far more seriously. The travails which subsequently came upon her began on 24 May 1546, when letters were sent to Thomas Kyme requiring him to appear before the privy council with his wife within fourteen days. On 19 June Kyme duly attended with Anne, who denied that he was her husband; he then returned home, while she was incarcerated. In <span class="italic">The lattre examinacyon</span> Askew describes the two-day interrogation to which she was subjected by the king's council at Greenwich&#151;on this occasion her questioners included: the chancellor, Sir Thomas Wriothesley; Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester; John Dudley, Viscount Lisle; William Parr, earl of Essex; and Sir William Paget, the king's principal secretary. Despite threats of execution, Askew steadfastly refused to recant. Her request to speak with Hugh Latimer was refused. She was then imprisoned in Newgate in &#145;extremyte of syckenesse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examinations</span>, 102).<h2>
<a name="Condemnationtortureandexecution"></a>Condemnation, torture, and execution</h2>Askew's second examination had been far more intensive, and conducted at a much higher level, than her first. The events which followed explain the differences between the two processes. Their background was the political and religious uncertainty of the last year of Henry VIII's reign, as conservatives and reformers competed for a position which would give them control of government when the king died, as it was clear he soon would, and a minor succeeded. On 28 June 1546 Askew was arraigned for heresy at the Guildhall along with Nicholas Shaxton, former bishop of Salisbury, and two other men. Shaxton abjured, but Askew and another were condemned, &#145;without any triall of a jurie&#146;  (Wriothesley, 167) and thus contrary to the law. The next day she was taken from Newgate to the Tower. Word had got out that she had contacts with noblewomen at court, who sympathized with her religious stance. This gave the conservative faction grounds for hoping she could be induced to incriminate her abettors, and by implication their husbands, and so ruin the reformist cause in the eyes of the doctrinally conservative king. Wriothesley and Sir Richard Rich, another councillor, tried to force Askew to name other members of her &#145;secte&#146;. When she refused, they took the exceptional step of having her tortured, even going so far as to turn the rack themselves&#151;as a woman, gently born, and a condemned person, she should have been exempt from such treatment.<br>
<br>Askew was questioned about whether she had received any support from members of the privy council, and specifically asked about &#145;my ladye of Sothfolke, my ladye of Sussex, my ladye of Hertforde, my lady Dennye, and my ladye Fizwyllyams&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examinations</span>, 122). These were women in the queen's immediate circle who were evidently suspected of encouraging the spread of protestantism, and together constitute an aristocratic roll-call which underlines just how high the political and religious stakes had become; Lady Hertford's husband, Edward Seymour, would be protector of the realm and leader of the evangelicals less than a year hence. Indeed, her torturers were probably also motivated by the hope that she would incriminate the queen&#151;Katherine Parr was a committed religious radical. Persons even suggests that they were operating under the instructions of Henry VIII himself, who had been informed that Askew had access to his wife's immediate circle and sought &#145;to corrupt divers people but especially weomen&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Narratives</span>, 308). Askew eventually acknowledged that two men who had given her money in prison claimed to have done so on behalf of Lady Hertford and Lady Denny. But she said that for the most part she relied on her maid, who obtained money from apprentices, and could not be persuaded to extend her testimony further. The unlawfulness of these proceedings caused the privy council some anxiety, but attempts to cover them up did not succeed: on 2 July, a London merchant, Ottiwell Johnson, wrote to his brother that Askew remained &#145;in stedfast mynde, and yet she hath ben rakked sins her condempnacion&#146;  (ibid., 306).<br>
<br>Askew was removed to a house to recover and once more offered the opportunity to recant, then taken to Newgate to await her execution. On 16 July 1546, aged about twenty-five according to Bale, she was burnt at the stake in Smithfield, alongside John Lascels, John Hadlam, who was a tailor, and John Hemley, formerly an Observant friar. Nicholas Shaxton, who had recanted, delivered the sermon. If her persecutors intended that Shaxton's performance should reinforce the message of Askew's execution, while at the same time indicating that the retraction of erroneous beliefs was possible, evangelicals interpreted his presence differently. Robert Crowley, for instance, denounces Shaxton for his inconstancy, contrasting him unfavourably with Askew, who had &#145;stood manfully to the truth&#146;  (Crowley, sigs. K5<i>r</i>&#150;K5<i>v</i>). John Foxe even includes a fictionalized exchange between the condemned woman and the preacher in his account of Askew's execution in the second edition of his <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>. The lord chancellor, the lord mayor, Sir Martin Bowes, and the duke of Norfolk were among those present when Askew was burnt, watching from a scaffold. The Catholic propagandist Miles Huggarde has it that Askew was offered a pardon, but defied the officers with &#145;opprobrious names&#146; and made the sign of the gallows to the preacher  (Huggarde, fol. 46<i>v</i>). But Johne Louthe, an eyewitness to the events, says that she &#145;was so racked that she could not stand, but the dounge carte was holden up betwene ij sarjantes, perhaptes syttyng there in a cheare&#146;. He also maintains that throughout her suffering she had an angel's countenance, and a smiling face, and claims that at the moment of her death there was &#145;a pleasant crackyng from heaven&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Narratives</span>, 41&#150;4). German merchants in the audience brought reports of this strange natural phenomenon to Bale, then in exile on the continent.<h2>
<a name="Contributionandreputation"></a>Contribution and reputation</h2>For Askew's enduring renown as a protestant saint and for her more recent reputation as a Renaissance woman writer, she is considerably indebted to Bale. The first edition of <span class="italic">The first examinacyon of Anne Askewe, latelye martyred in Smythfelde</span> was printed at Wesel in Germany in the year of her death in a text which included his introduction, conclusion, and intertextual commentary. The following year the second part of this work, <span class="italic">The lattre examinacyon of Anne Askewe</span>, was published in the same city. For Bale, who saw his own role as that of a martyrologist, the story of Askewe's interrogations was that of a protestant saint. He was evidently an intrusive editor, and some of the material included in his texts, especially the paraphrase of <span class="roman">Psalm 54</span> and the ballad which Askew supposedly wrote and sang while in Newgate, may be falsely attributed to her. His extensive glosses reveal the extent to which he freely interpreted the material available to him to make it fit not only his own apocalyptic historiographical scheme (according to which Askew represents one of the two witnesses of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>) but also his assumptions about gender. Consequently his depiction of Askew as young, weak, and tender, if also brave and steadfast, is somewhat at odds with her own self-representation as a disputatious individual, confident of her salvation, and inspired to follow in the footsteps of Christ.<br>
<br>Askew seems to have written down the events that led up to her condemnation at the request of religious sympathizers&#151;she addresses the second part to &#145;a secrete frynde&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examinations</span>, 88)&#151;and evidently hoped that her narrative would encourage others in adversity. Bale's edition and texts based on them were reprinted several times, but it was the incorporation of Askew's autobiography (without Bale's additions) into Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span> (from its first edition onwards) which ensured its continuing popularity&#151;and her fame&#151;in the centuries which followed. Although a broadside ballad about Askew's fate, entitled &#145;I am a woman poore and blinde&#146;, which came out in a number of editions over a period of some seventy years during the seventeenth century, replaced the confrontational but calm and rational heroine of her own testimonial with an image of feminine passivity and suffering, this view was by no means the only or dominant one. One of the most remarkable tributes to Askew was made in 1673 by Bathsua Makin, formerly a tutor in the household of Charles I, when she called her &#145;a person famous for learning and piety&#146; and claimed that Askew had &#145;so seasoned the Queen and ladies at Court, by her precepts and example, and after sealed her profession with her book, that the seed of reformation seemed to be sowed by her hand&#146;  (Makin, 134).<br>
