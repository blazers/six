<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reeves,  William Pember</span>  (1857&#150;1932), <span class="occ">diplomatist and political activist</span>, was born on 10 February 1857 in Lyttelton, Canterbury, New Zealand. He was the second of eight surviving children of William Reeves (1825&#150;1891), businessman, originally of Clapham, and his wife, Ellen (1833&#150;1919), daughter of John Pember, also of Clapham. Reeves's parents emigrated to New Zealand after incurring losses on the stock exchange. His father dabbled in farming and politics before becoming part owner of the <span class="italic">Lyttelton Times</span> newspaper. Born within a month of their landfall in the fledgeling colony of Canterbury, Reeves seems to have been influenced by his mother's sense of social and intellectual superiority which, throughout his life in New Zealand, made him distant from his coevals. He was educated in Christchurch: at Lincoln College preparatory school (1862&#150;3), the high school (1866&#150;7), and at Christ's College Grammar School (1867&#150;74). He won scholarships for distinction in the classics, English, languages, and history. In 1874 he intended to enter the University of Oxford to read law, but in 1876 was forced by illness (possibly a nervous breakdown) to return to Canterbury without a degree.<br>
<br>His health restored for a time, Reeves was a determined sportsman who represented Canterbury at cricket and rugby. But he was not physically robust, and was dogged throughout his life by migraines and nervous debility. He became a law clerk, and in 1880 was admitted to the bar in a profession which he loathed. Realizing a talent for journalism, he reported for the <span class="italic">Lyttelton Times</span>, becoming its editor (1889&#150;91), and wrote outstanding leaders on political and social issues at a time of emergent class politics. In 1887 he entered parliament as an opposition MP on a radical platform of wealth redistribution. In 1890, under the pseudonym Pharos, he published articles on theories of socialism, reflecting his attraction to the ideas of Henry George, Ferdinand Lassalle, and the Fabians, rather than Marx.<br>
<br>On 10 February 1885 he married Magdalen (Maud) Stuart Robison [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41214/', "Reeves, Magdalen Stuart (1865&#150;1953)")</script>], daughter of a bank manager in Christchurch. She was a match for his intellect, a suffragist, and also a Fabian. However, calamity marked Reeves's personal life and caused him great distress. His elder daughter, Amber (1887&#150;1981) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63956/', "White, Amber Blanco")</script>], was an exceptional Cambridge scholar, but outraged Reeves by having an affair with H. G. Wells (already on his second marriage), and by becoming pregnant before marrying someone else. Wells later depicted the scandal, and caricatured Reeves, in <span class="italic">Ann Veronica</span> (1909). Beryl, a second daughter, was born in 1889, but to Reeves's lasting grief his son, Fabian (<i>b</i>. 1895), died in action as an airman in 1917.<br>
<br>Although he was limited in political experience, Reeves's skill as a witty and acerbic debater and his championship of the working class led to a cabinet post as minister of education and justice in the 1891 Liberal ministry. After the 1892 general election he became minister of labour. In a period of industrial strife and class antagonism, he pioneered improvements in the employment conditions of shop workers, seamen, and factory workers. His most renowned achievement was the <span class="roman">Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act</span> (1894). Although defective in practice, it introduced the principle of compulsory arbitration to resolve industrial disputes. Reeves increasingly cavilled at the cabinet's waning radicalism, but was himself denounced for attempting to prevent the immigration of Asians and paupers.<br>
<br>In 1896 Reeves escaped the hostility of his colleagues to become New Zealand's agent-general in London (a post renamed high commissioner in 1905). He excelled at representing the colony's economic interests, and was much in demand as a speaker and commentator on New Zealand's development. An accomplished poet and historian, he also published one of New Zealand's most admired general histories, <span class="italic">The Long White Cloud: Ao tea roa</span> (1898). This was followed in 1902 by a scholarly account of social legislation, <span class="italic">State Experiments in Australia &amp; New Zealand</span> (2 vols.). He also contributed New Zealand entries to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>In London Reeves revelled in his reputation as a radical legislator, and delighted in the friendship of Herbert Samuel and Fabians such as the Webbs, G. B. Shaw, and H. G. Wells. A member of the Fabian Society, he wrote a tract entitled <span class="italic">The State and its Functions in New Zealand</span> (1896). Unable to afford the expense of standing for Westminster, though it was mooted in 1898&#150;1900, he became active in London politics, and helped Sidney Webb to get re-elected to the London county council as a Progressive in 1907. His interest in social and imperial reform coincided with the views of Liberal Imperialists. He influenced Alfred Lyttelton, secretary of state, with a scheme for constitutional reform of the former empire, not as a federation, but with a council and secretariat. By 1907 the scheme was watered down, but the essence of Reeves's approach was ultimately adopted in the form of the British Commonwealth. He also embraced the concept of national efficiency, becoming one of the twelve members of the cross-party Co-Efficient Club founded by the Webbs in 1902. Reeves worked for the adoption of old-age pensions, but by &#145;socialism&#146; he meant state paternalism to avert social unrest; he disapproved of New Zealand strikers who exploited flaws in the arbitration system. He held orthodox financial views, and abandoned imperial preference as a way of protecting nascent colonial industries, in favour of free trade. Reeves's expertise was recognized in his membership of the commercial intelligence committee of the Board of Trade and of the 1905&#150;9 royal commission on shipping rings.<br>
<br>Obliged by a new prime minister to resign as high commissioner, Reeves was made director of the London School of Economics and Political Science by the Webbs in 1908. He had already been occasionally involved in the school as a lecturer and a crown nominee on the University of London senate. He also fitted the Webbs' requirement for a free-trader in the post. Reeves dramatically improved the school's finances, but he failed to provide leadership and was unpopular with many of the academic staff. He fell out with the chief administrator, and Sidney Webb pressured him to resign in 1919.<br>
<br>Reeves enthusiastically supported the cause of Greek expansion, about which he wrote several articles and pamphlets. He presided over the Anglo-Hellenic League (1913&#150;25), became a supporter and friend of Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos, and, although he had rejected the trappings of privilege associated with British honours, accepted the Greek order of the Saviour (1914) and the order of George I (1920), as well as an honorary doctorate from Athens University (1914). He travelled widely but returned only once to New Zealand, in 1925&#150;6, on behalf of the National Bank of New Zealand, of which he was chairman (1917&#150;31). He was f&ecirc;ted as a prodigal son on his tour, but no longer had firm roots there.<br>
<br>In appearance Reeves was tall and lean, and in character reserved and morose. Anxiety-ridden and thin-skinned, he could be kindly and amusing, but was often caustic. Reeves suffered from cancer of the prostate. He died at his London home, 31 Pembroke Square, on 15 May 1932 and was cremated at Golders Green cemetery, survived by his wife and daughters.<br>
