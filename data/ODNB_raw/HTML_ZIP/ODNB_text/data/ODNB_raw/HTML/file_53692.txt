<span class="headword">Warrack,  Harriet</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1825, <em>d.</em> 1910), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was baptized on 14 December 1825, at Old Machar, Aberdeen. Her father, James Warrack (<i>d</i>. 1863), an Aberdeen tea dealer and grocer, later a commission agent, was well known in Aberdeen business circles. Her mother, Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1857), was the daughter of George Morren, an Aberdeen stocking manufacturer. Harriet was the fifth child in a family of four brothers and two sisters. Three brothers were educated at the Aberdeen grammar school, but nothing definite is known of her education, though her obituarist referred to it as &#145;sound&#146;. She may have attended the female Lancasterian school in Aberdeen, where one of her aunts was a teacher. Miss Warrack's father suffered financial difficulties and moved house a number of times, but even so the family lived on fashionable streets and were probably all brought up in reasonably comfortable middle-class surroundings. The two eldest brothers, John and James, went on to found shipping companies in Leith and Montrose; the youngest, Alexander, became a minister. Shortly after the death of her father in 1863 Harriet Warrack also found it necessary to support herself.<br>
<br>Accordingly, about 1867, when she was over forty, Miss Warrack opened in Aberdeen a private school for upper-middle-class girls, later to be known as Albyn School. Two years later the school moved to Union Place. An able woman, Miss Warrack ran her school with success, attracting boarders from the country as well as day girls from the town. She was in the vanguard in promoting better academic standards for upper-middle-class girls in Aberdeen, a cause advanced by the Aberdeen Ladies' Educational Association. She organized a private class for more advanced courses at the school and in the 1870s was the first Aberdeen school proprietor to persuade girls to sit the university local examinations. She also organized correspondence tutorial classes and not only held quarterly examinations of the pupils but published examples of them. By the time Miss Warrack retired in 1886 Albyn Place School was by far the largest and most academic private girls' school in Aberdeen, and the foundations had been laid for it to continue for more than another hundred years. In no small part this was owing to her wise selection of staff and, in particular, of her successor, Alexander Mackie, a brilliant teacher, to whom she gave full management and control after he had been at the school for six years.<br>
<br>Harriet Warrack was good-looking in a somewhat severe fashion, an admirable organizer, and a woman of strong character. She was a member of the Free Church of Scotland, attending the Free West Church while Revd Laidlaw was minister there and later the Queen's Cross Free Church. She died on 23 April 1910 at her home, 2 Queen's Gate, Aberdeen, and was buried at Allenvale cemetery, Aberdeen.<br>
