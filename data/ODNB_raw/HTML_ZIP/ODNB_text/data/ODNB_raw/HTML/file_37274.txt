<span class="headword">Chance, Sir  James Timmins</span>, first baronet  (1814&#150;1902), <span class="occ">glass manufacturer and lighthouse engineer</span>, was born in Birmingham on 22 March 1814, the eldest of the six sons of William Chance (1788&#150;1856), merchant and glass manufacturer, of Spring Grove, Birmingham, and his wife, Phoebe (<i>d</i>. 1865), fourth daughter of James Timmins of Birmingham. From a private school at Totteridge, James passed to University College School, London, where he gained high honours in languages, mathematics, and science. At seventeen he entered his father's mercantile business, but found the work distasteful and began to study for holy orders. In 1833 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he made mathematics his chief study, won a foundation scholarship, and graduated BA as seventh wrangler in 1838, after losing a year through insomnia brought on by overwork; he proceeded MA there in 1841, and MA <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford in 1848. He had also begun the study of law, in 1836 entering as a student at Lincoln's Inn, but circumstances obliged him, on leaving Cambridge, to join his uncle, Robert Lucas Chance, and his father in their glassworks at Spon Lane, Smethwick, near Birmingham. Here he devoted himself to the manufacturing side of the business and to its scientific developments. He married, on 26 June 1845, Elizabeth, fourth daughter of George Ferguson of Houghton Hall, Carlisle; she died on 27 August 1887. They had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>While still at Cambridge, Chance had invented a process for polishing sheet glass so as to produce &#145;patent plate&#146;, but it was the production and perfection of lighthouse lenses which came to absorb his attention. This difficult manufacture, originally a French invention, was first carried on in England by Cookson &amp; Co. of South Shields from 1831 to 1845, when it became again the monopoly of two firms in Paris. About 1850 the Chances started to make lighthouse lenses. They engaged a M. Tabouret, a French expert, to superintend the work but he left their service in 1853. Two years later manufacture began in earnest under James Chance's direction. Royal commissioners had been appointed in 1858 to inquire into the state of the lights, buoys, and beacons of the United Kingdom, and had soon detected grave defects in existing apparatus. On 23 December 1859 the commissioners visited the Spon Lane works, where they assessed Chance's technical competence and examined the production facilities. At the request of the commissioners, Sir George Airy, the astronomer royal, consulted with Chance and on 2 and 3 April 1860 examined at Spon Lane a large apparatus under construction for the government of Victoria. New principles formulated by Airy were first tried upon an apparatus which the company was constructing for the Russian government.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1860 Chance joined Michael Faraday, acting for Trinity House, in experimenting with the firm's apparatus at the Whitby southern lighthouse. Faraday acknowledged his debt to Chance for the earnest and intelligent manner in which he co-operated in these trials, working and thinking out every point, and declared his confidence in the firm's capabilities. One thing that Chance discovered at Whitby was that it was not necessary to adjust lighthouse equipment <i>in situ</i> against the horizon itself, but that a graduated staff at a short distance from the light could be used. This important discovery enabled the apparatus to be adjusted accurately before it left the factory.<br>
<br>Chance effected permanent alterations in the Whitby light on the newly formulated scientific principles. A detailed paper dealing with all the questions at issue, which he sent to the commissioners in January 1861, formed part of their report. In May 1861, by request of Trinity House, Chance took part in an examination of all the dioptric apparatus in their charge. Most of the lights were of French manufacture, and in several cases Chance could remedy the defects only by reconstructing them, making the final adjustments mostly with his own hands. The old system of requiring the firm to make lights to prescribed specifications was abandoned, and Chance, with rare exceptions, was left to design them himself. He personally superintended every detail of the work, and from a sense of patriotism declined to patent improvements but made them public property. At the Paris Exhibition of 1867 his designs were demonstrably more efficient than similar apparatus of French manufacture. On 7 May in the same year he read before the Institution of Civil Engineers a paper entitled &#145;Optical apparatus used in lighthouses&#146;, which became a classic, and for which he was awarded a Telford medal and premium, and elected an associate of the institution. On 22 April 1879 he read before the institution a second important paper, &#145;Dioptric apparatus in lighthouses for the electric light&#146;. Meanwhile, in 1872, he handed over responsibility for the lighthouse works to a new director, Dr John Hopkinson, and gradually retired from the management of the firm.<br>
<br>Chance was actively engaged in local and county affairs, and was prominent in directing the chief religious, educational, and philanthropic institutions in Birmingham. At a cost, including the endowment, of &pound;30,000, in 1895 he gave the town West Smethwick Park. He was high sheriff of Staffordshire in 1868, and was mainly instrumental in forming the Handsworth volunteer rifle corps, the first corps in the midlands. He was a director of the London and North Western Railway from 1863 to 1874. In 1900 he endowed, at a cost of &pound;50,000, the Chance School of Engineering in the University of Birmingham. He was created a baronet in the same year.<br>
<br>Chance lived at Brown's Green, Handsworth, Birmingham (1845&#150;69), Four Oaks Park, Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire (1870&#150;79), and afterwards at 51 Prince's Gate, London, and 1 Grand Avenue, Hove, Sussex, where he died on 6 January 1902. He was buried, after cremation at Woking, in the Church of England cemetery, Warstone Lane, Birmingham. William, his eldest son, a barrister of the Inner Temple, succeeded as second baronet.<br>

<a name="cosubject_37274"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Macomb Chance</span>  (1844&#150;1917), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 28 June 1844 in Edgbaston, Birmingham, the ninth and youngest child of George Chance, hardware merchant, and his wife, Cornelia Maria, daughter of Arent Schuyler de Peyster of New York. George was a brother of Robert Lucas Chance, who had founded Chance Brothers &amp; Co., glass makers of Smethwick, in 1824; Alexander was therefore a cousin of James Timmins Chance. Alexander was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and then in Lausanne, subsequently joining the family firm.<br>
<br>Chance Brothers had established an alkali works at Oldbury in 1835, to supply the glassworks. Alexander Chance became managing director of the works in June 1868 and was made a partner of Chance Brothers in 1879. In 1870 he married Florence Hasted Mercer (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Major Arthur Hill Hasted Mercer, of the 60th rifles. They had eight children. When the alkali works were converted into the Oldbury Alkali Company Ltd in 1890, Chance was made deputy chairman as well as managing director. He decided not to take part in the creation of the United Alkali Company in 1890, but in 1898 amalgamated his firm with another Leblanc soda manufacturer, Hunt &amp; Sons of Wednesbury, to form Chance and Hunt Ltd. He was chairman of Chance and Hunt from 1901 until his retirement in June 1912; Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. (later part of ICI) acquired a majority shareholding in Chance and Hunt in 1917. In 1907, four years after his first wife's death, Chance married Agnes Elizabeth, daughter of William Fleming of Inverness. There were no children of this marriage.<br>
<br>Alexander Chance is chiefly remembered for the Chance process for the recovery of sulphur in the Leblanc method. This enabled the latter to weather, for another thirty years, the challenge from the ammonia&#150;soda process used by the Solvay Company in Belgium and its British partner, Brunner Mond. The Leblanc process prepared soda (sodium carbonate) by heating salt with sulphuric acid, which formed salt-cake (sodium sulphate) and hydrochloric acid gas. The salt-cake was then converted into the desired soda by heating it with coal and limestone in large revolving furnaces. Unfortunately, impure calcium sulphide was a major by-product of this second step, and the Leblanc works were surrounded by mounds of evil-smelling waste called &#145;galligu&#146;. In the 1880s Chance developed a method of pumping carbon dioxide gas through tanks of a slurry of galligu and water. The hydrogen sulphide gas thereby freed from calcium sulphide was burned to produce elemental sulphur, which was used to make sulphuric acid.<br>
<br>Chance built a convalescent home for his workers and set up a fund which quickly paid out compensation for industrial accidents on a no-fault basis. His concern about the evil effects of drunkenness led to the formation of the Langley Temperance Club, and he was also active in the social work of the Church of England. He presented the open space of Warley Woods to the city of Birmingham. Chance died at his home, Walcot, St Mark's Road, Torquay, Devon, on 22 November 1917.<br>
