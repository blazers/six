<span class="headword">Thorn, Sir  Jules</span>  (1899&#150;1980), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born in Vienna, Austria, on 6 February 1899 to Jewish parents: his father was Leon Thorn, an insurance company director, and he was the youngest of three brothers, one of whom moved to Britain, the other to the USA. On leaving school he was conscripted into the Austrian army to fight in the First World War; he saw action on the Russian front, where he was taken prisoner. After the war he studied business and management at the Handelshochschule&#151; the commerce school in Vienna. On graduation he obtained a position as representative of an Austrian electric lamp manufacturer, and first arrived in Britain in that capacity. When that company went bankrupt in 1926 Thorn found himself responsible for a number of its debts, but, such was his business reputation already, he was able to raise sufficient capital to pay them off and start up in business for himself, as an importer of Hungarian lamps, selling them through his own Electric Lamp Service Company Ltd, which he incorporated in March 1928. In 1928, however, following government restrictions on lamp importations, imposed under pressure from a cartel of the British lamp manufacturers (which he was later to break), Thorn went into manufacturing under the Atlas brand. In the same year he married Dorothy Olive Tanner; they had two children, Cedric and Ann. In 1936, having diversified into the manufacturing and selling of radio equipment, his company, named Thorn Electrical Industries, went public, its shares being oversubscribed by a factor of 35. It was at this time that Thorn was joined by radio engineer and fellow Austrian, Alfred (Freddy) Deutsch, in a partnership that lasted forty years.<br>
<br>Thorn's aggressive move into the new area of manufacturing in the face of opposition from established firms was typical of him. He possessed an entrepreneurial attitude then unusual in the British industrial establishment, and was motivated by the challenge of success itself rather than personal gain. Time and again he committed his own and his family fortune to high-risk ventures, entering new markets, buying companies, or investing in new ideas. Concomitant with this calculated high risk-taking, Thorn concentrated control of the company entirely in his own hands. Short in stature and unflinchingly courteous, he was nevertheless ruthless and renowned for his tireless energy and ebullient flair. Throughout a period of increased corporate bureaucratization, Thorn retained a high degree of independence and maintained his self-made image as a rebel.<br>
<br>Thorn was interested in psychology and used it in his sales and management method, instilling in all his staff a belief in Thorn Electrical Industries, urging them to identify as much as possible with the company's interests. Equally, he strove to convince retailers how Thorn products could improve their businesses. In the 1930s he knew the majority of his staff by name, and tried to help them both personally and professionally. By 1976, 15,000 staff (of a total workforce of 75,000) had more than ten years service, and 30,000 had more than five years.<br>
<br>In 1946 Thorn secured a crucial coup, signing an agreement with an American company, Sylvania Electric Products, for co-operation in the development and manufacture of fluorescent tubes. With this deal he established the basis for the company's post-war success in lighting equipment. In the same year Thorn Electrical Industries produced their first television receiver, under the Ferguson brand, continuing their trademark expansion and diversification, which by 1950 had encompassed Ekco-Ensign Electric. In the immediate post-war years Thorn acquired more British lamp factories, and plants in Australia and South Africa. With the acquisition of Tricity Cookers in 1951 he moved into a new and booming field in domestic electrical appliances. In the same decade he took over the manufacture of the HMV and Marconiphone range of consumer products from Electric and Musical Industries Ltd and purchased Ultra Radio and Television&#151;moves that consolidated his position as a leading manufacturer of consumer appliances.<br>
<br>In 1961 Thorn entered the retail market, merging his manufacturing interests with Radio Rentals, then the country's leading domestic appliance rental organization. Further expansion in this side of the business occurred in 1975 when he purchased J. and F. Stores. In 1968 he bought Kenwood, manufacturers of food mixers, and the Parkinson Cowan range of gas cookers and meters. To ensure supplies of sheet metal, essential to the production of cookers, he purchased Metal Industries, and as a result diversified into engineering; Clarkson International Tools was bought in 1974 and Cleveland Twist Drill in 1976. Thorn also invested &pound;1,250,000 in lighting laboratories at Enfield.<br>
<br>The extent of Thorn's control over the company was demonstrated by his unwillingness to retire and to relinquish control to a successor, and in the last years of his career there were open quibbles over his leadership. However, in 1976, the year he retired as chairman, the company showed pre-tax profits of &pound;74.4 million on a turnover of &pound;956 million.<br>
<br>A naturalized British citizen, Thorn was knighted in 1964. Of his private life, little is known. His family were sent to America on the outbreak of the Second World War. His marriage never recovered from this separation and the couple parted in 1950. In 1971 his first marriage was dissolved, and on 23 June 1971 he married a divorcee, Jane Norfolk, the daughter of Arthur Mayle, a farmer. Late in life he became a successful racehorse owner and bought an important collection of Impressionist paintings. Thorn gave generously to charity, particularly to Jewish charities, and specifically to the Haifa Technion, which married his Jewish sentiment to an abiding interest in scientific development. Throughout his career he combined great accuracy of judgement over business and take-over issues with determined ruthlessness and an institutional drive, which motivated both him and his employees and made him and the company important factors in the post-war British economy. He died at his home, 21 York Terrace East, Westminster, London, on 12 December 1980, survived by his second wife.<br>
