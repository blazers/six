<span class="headword">Avranches,  Henry  d'</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1262/3), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was a Norman by birth; his father's name may have been Troteman. The title of master was accorded him, but nothing is known of his education. However, his works show a knowledgeable interest in grammar, logic, Aristotelian philosophy, medicine, and canon law, and a marked penchant for the translation of prose texts into verse.<br>
<br>Henry's poetic career began as early as 1215. He was in England by 1219, when he wrote an epitaph for William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, who died in that year. In the 1220s he began the series of verse lives of English saints that constitutes the greater part of his work: Birinus, Guthlac, Hugh of Lincoln, Oswald, Edmund, and Fremund. He also wrote an account of the translation of the relics of St Thomas of Canterbury. Moreover, at this time Henry contributed a poem to the fund-raising campaign for the construction of Salisbury Cathedral, which had begun in 1221, and wrote for patrons in Cologne. About 1228 he moved to the papal court, where he wrote occasional verse for patrons throughout western Europe. He composed his <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">Life of St Francis</span> in fourteen books, for Pope Gregory IX (<i>r</i>. 1227&#150;41). He also wrote at the court of the patriarch of Aquileia, and approached the emperor Frederick II (<i>r</i>. 1220&#150;50) with a series of poems about 1236. Henry left Italy in the late 1230s. He seems to have travelled in the Rhineland, and was in Paris in 1241, when he commemorated the arrival of relics of the crucifixion, and then in Angers, where he taught and disputed with local poets.<br>
<br>By 1243 Henry d'Avranches had entered the service of Henry III in England, and composed lives of St Edward (Edward the Confessor) and St George (both now lost) for the king. He left the king's service for a few years after March 1245, and it was probably during this period that he compiled a metrical grammar for the children of Hamo Peche, a Cambridgeshire magnate. In 1251 Henry returned to the royal service. He seems to have been intimate with the king and perhaps prominent at court: writing in 1258 the poet John Garland praised Henry in a list of the great figures of the English court; but there is no reason to believe that Henry held a position corresponding to the modern poet laureate, as has sometimes been alleged. He is best known today for the series of public contests of poetic invective in which he engaged with his student Michael the Cornishman (Michael Blaunpayn) in the mid-1250s; unfortunately only Michael's verses survive. These contests were notable events, judged by such prominent patrons as the king's half-brother Aymer de Lusignan (<i>d</i>. 1260), bishop-elect of Winchester. Henry died, presumably in England, between 26 January 1262 and 2 April 1263.<br>
