<span class="headword">Gladstone,  Helen</span>  (1849&#150;1925), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in London on 28 August 1849, the sixth of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10787/', "William Ewart Gladstone (1809&#150;1898)")</script>, who was four times British prime minister, and his wife, Catherine (1812&#150;1900), daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, bt, of Hawarden, Flintshire, and his wife, Mary. An elder sister having died in childhood, Helen was the youngest of three girls in the lively crowd of seven children growing up at Hawarden Castle&#151;their number often doubled and more by an influx of their favourite cousins, the Lytteltons of Hagley in Worcestershire. On a generally crowded canvas Helen's childhood is all but invisible, and it is not until 1873, when her eldest sister left home on marriage, that she seems to emerge as an individual. As one of the cousins then noted, there was now scope for &#145;the two unmarried&#146;. Mary effectively freed her mother for charitable work by running the household; Helen was involved with the village schools and no doubt would have gone on like that had not her more dynamic sister faced her, after a visit to Cambridge, with the surprising proposition that she should study at Newnham Hall (soon to become a women's college). Fired by those pioneers of women's education Henry Sidgwick and his wife Nora, Mary was eager to persuade her father that Helen should try it for a year. Helen was compliant but apprehensive. She had a keen desire to study but her schoolroom days were remote and had been governess-led, at home. She doubted if she could master political economy, felt ashamed that her memory was bad, and worried lest Newnhamites should be given to over-free discussion of the Christian faith. Still, in 1877 she went to Newnham: the oldest (at twenty-eight) of its twenty-five students, and probably the most diffident.<br>
<br>Being in this &#145;pie of girls&#146;, as she wrote, seemed queer at first but Helen came to enjoy it. She did not wish to go in for the tripos but passed the higher local examination with distinction in political economy. In 1880 she became secretary to Nora Sidgwick (then vice-principal) and succeeded her two years later, proud of having this part to play in moulding the life of the new community. No one cherished the highlights of the college's early years more: whether the day that Philippa Fawcett was placed above the senior wrangler, the visit of Mr and Mrs Gladstone to Newnham to plant a tree there in 1887, or the university's solemn tribute on the death of Miss Clough, its first principal. It seemed a hopeful time for women. When Helen asked her father in 1896 to add his signature to a memorial that women should be allowed to take degrees, she could not have guessed it would be fifty years before the university made this concession.<br>
<br>In July 1886 Helen was invited to become first principal of the new Royal Holloway College. This immediately exposed a question of the relative claims of work and home which had been implicit since she went to Newnham but gained new immediacy from the fact that her sister Mary had recently married and could not be assumed to stay at Hawarden for ever; also that it would have been out of the question to combine Royal Holloway with &#145;home duties&#146;. Though she canvassed opinions widely Helen seems to have been clear from the start that to take the post would be morally wrong. The moment of truth came ten years later, in 1896, when she resigned from Newnham to look after her parents (by then well in their eighties). It was a wrench to leave the work she loved for duties which she had never performed as well as Mary, or in a way that pleased her mother. Her father died in 1898 and Mrs Gladstone in 1900. For several years afterwards Helen was warden of the Women's University Settlement in Southwark. In 1910 she left London for Hawarden, where she lived at Sundial until her death there on 19 August 1925, happily near to her extended family but still in touch with Newnham, whose students recalled her open-hearted interest as well as her habit of overdoing the anecdotes of Mr Gladstone. She was buried in Hawarden church.<br>
