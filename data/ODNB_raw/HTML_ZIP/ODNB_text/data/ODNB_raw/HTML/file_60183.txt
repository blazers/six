<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pfeiffer,  Rudolf Carl Franz Otto</span>  (1889&#150;1979), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in the house in Augsburg, Germany, which had belonged in the sixteenth century to the humanist Conrad Peutinger, on 28 September 1889, the son of Carl Philip Jacob Pfeiffer, a printing office proprietor, and his wife, Elizabeth Naegele. He was educated at the Benedictine abbey of St Stephan, remaining a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life, and then at the University of Munich. While there he married, in 1913, Lili (<i>d</i>. 1969), daughter of Sigmund Beer. His doctoral dissertation of 1914 on Johannes Spreng, the Augsburg Meistersinger and translator of Homer, combined the history of Augsburg with the study of Greek poetry and the history of classical scholarship, the two themes that informed the whole of his work.<br>
<br>After military service in the First World War, in which Pfeiffer was severely wounded, he returned to the University of Munich as librarian. In 1920 he was given leave to study for a year in Berlin, editing in 1921 the newly discovered fragments of the Hellenistic poet Callimachus and earning his <i>Habilitation</i>. He returned to Munich as a <i>Privat-Dozent</i>, but in 1923 accepted a call as professor, to Berlin, and then in the same year to Hamburg; the appointment evoked the surprise of the Latinist Eduard Norden, who described Pfeiffer in a letter to Fritz Saxl, of the Warburg Institute, as still no more than promising (&#145;nur eine Hoffnung&#146;; 18 July 1923, Saxl MSS).<br>
<br>Pfeiffer was not at home in the north, and through illness missed lectures at the Warburg Institute. The desire of the institute, whose library Pfeiffer evidently used, that he should lecture on Erasmus took fifteen months to come to fruition: &#145;Humanitas Erasmiana&#146; was delivered on 27 November 1926, and published in 1931 without significant change, despite Saxl's optimistic suggestion that Pfeiffer might add material about Erasmus and England (<span class="italic">Humanitas Erasmiana</span>, Studien der Bibliothek Warburg, 22, 1931). It was presumably because Pfeiffer was known to be thinking of a new edition of the <span class="italic">Antibarbari</span> that Saxl had thought of the subject for the lecture; in the event, Pfeiffer was informed by P. S. Allen that a new manuscript of an early version existed, and abandoned his plans. His work concentrated on Hellenistic poetry in general and on Callimachus in particular; he accepted a call in 1927 to Freiburg im Breisgau and in 1929 to Munich. He remained in touch with the Warburg Institute, accepting in 1931 an invitation to be responsible for the bibliography on the legacy of the survival and transmission of classical scholarship (&#145;Nachleben der Antike in der klassischen Gelehrsamkeit&#146;).<br>
<br>Both Pfeiffer's beliefs and the Jewish origin of his wife made it in due course impossible for him to remain in Germany, and he resigned his chair in 1937. He arrived in Oxford in the following year. The Warburg Institute had arrived in London in 1933, and the classical scholar Eduard Fraenkel in Oxford in 1935, and Pfeiffer was at once in contact with both: Saxl was soon once more trying to persuade Pfeiffer to lecture. Pfeiffer lived, like most refugees of the period, from a variety of sources, until in 1946 he was offered a post by Oxford as university lecturer in the history of classical scholarship. He became reader in Greek literature in 1950. During his time in Oxford he was a member of the senior common room of Corpus Christi College, of which he was elected an honorary fellow in 1959.<br>
<br>The most important consequence of Pfeiffer's exile was access to unpublished papyri of Callimachus and the agreement of Oxford University Press to publish his <span class="italic">Callimachus</span> (1949, 1953); his obituarist for the British Academy, Hugh Lloyd-Jones, said of the first volume that it was &#145;hard to think of a critical edition of an ancient text that comes nearer to perfection&#146;  (Lloyd-Jones, 776). Pfeiffer was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1949.<br>
<br>Pfeiffer returned to his chair in Munich in 1951 and retired in 1957; in retirement he concentrated on the history of classical scholarship, his first volume appearing in 1968 and covering the beginning down to the end of the Hellenistic period, the second in 1976, beginning with the Italian Renaissance. The core ideas had already been laid out in an article of 1938 and in a lecture to the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften in 1960, &#145;Philologia perennis&#146;. Both volumes appeared in English. The second volume should be regarded as unfinished, and reads like a series of sketches. Pfeiffer died in Munich on 6 May 1979.<br>
<br>For Pfeiffer, &#145;philology in the proper sense begins with scholar poets, who are impelled by their love of poetry to preserve the poetry of the past&#146;  (Lloyd-Jones, 777), beginning in the Hellenistic period. He regarded the study of the ancient world as having moral value and as essentially the study of great literature, in particular poetry, Greek poetry, and Homer. Like Erasmus, on whom he expressed his views in a paper of 1955, he too believed that the scriptures were a proper study for philology. Pfeiffer saw the two volumes on the history of classical scholarship as an essentially historical exercise, concerned with the continuity of knowledge and with truth that once established lasts forever, like the truth of Christianity. But the truth in which he was interested was internal to the activity of scholarship, an interest that led him to take a favourable view of the &#145;Augustan peace&#146;; and a phrase used in agreeing to lecture at the Warburg Institute in 1950, but in refusing to do so in a series devoted to religious festivals, is revealing: &#145;I am, unfortunately, no historian of religion, but only a simple classical scholar, and I would not feel entitled to deal with a festival as such&#146;  (14 May 1949, Saxl MSS).<br>
