<span class="headword">Palmer,  Henry Robinson</span>  (1795&#150;1844), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Hackney in 1795, one of the many children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21213/', "Revd Samuel Palmer")</script>, nonconformist minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker. He was educated at the academy run by his father. From 1811 to 1816 he was apprenticed to Bryan Donkin and he early displayed the keen interest in education and the formation of scientific societies that he pursued throughout his life. About 1813&#150;14 he organized in Bermondsey a society of workmen which virtually constituted a mechanics' institute, almost ten years before those established by Leonard Horner in Edinburgh and George Birkbeck in Glasgow and London.<br>
<br>On completing his apprenticeship Palmer was engaged by Thomas Telford and worked for him for ten years on a large number of road and canal surveys and associated designs. About 1817 he suggested to Joshua Field the idea of founding a society of engineers which would be more accessible to the younger members of the profession than the rather &eacute;litist Society of Civil Engineers founded by John Smeaton in 1771. The first meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers was held on 2 January 1818 with eight founder members present and Palmer gave the opening address, outlining the objectives of the institution. The institution, however, made slow progress until in 1820 Telford, who never joined the Smeatonians, agreed to become the first president and the rules restricting membership to younger engineers were relaxed. Palmer subsequently became a member of the council of the institution and in 1835 was elected one of the vice-presidents; he was always very attached to the body, contributing several interesting papers and seldom failing to take part in the discussions, which he considered to be the most valuable part of its meetings.<br>
<br>On 30 March 1827 Palmer married Mary Ann Emma Osmond at St Margaret's, Westminster. The previous year he had been appointed resident engineer to the London docks where, over the next nine years, he designed and executed the Eastern Dock, with the associated warehousing, entrance locks, bridges, and other works. He then moved to Westminster as a consulting engineer and was involved in numerous surveys for projected railways, and the design and construction of several docks and harbours, including those at Port Talbot, Ipswich, Penzance, and Neath. He carried out the original surveys for the South Eastern Railway, assisted by P. W. Barlow, and would have executed the scheme but ill health intervened. His original surveys for a Kentish railway dated from the time he was associated with Telford, and he gave parliamentary evidence in favour of navigation interests and against the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1825. Between 1821 and 1842 he took out five patents, one of them for a &#145;suspension railway&#146; which was tried out unsuccessfully in Cheshunt and Deptford Dockyard. Of more importance were those relating to a system of constructing roofs and bridge decks in corrugated wrought or cast iron. The roofs were used extensively in London docks and the patent rights sold to Richard Walker of Rotherhithe, who marketed the system widely. Palmer was elected FRS in 1831; he published two papers on tides and the movement of shingle, in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of 1831 and 1834.<br>
<br>Palmer died of dropsy on 12 September 1844 at 2 Great George Street, Westminster. A memorial window to him was installed in the main hall of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1954.<br>
