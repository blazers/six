<span class="headword">Ashworth,  John</span>  (1813&#150;1875), <span class="occ">preacher and author</span>, was born on 8 July 1813 at Cutgate, near Rochdale, Lancashire, the eighth child of John and Alice Ashworth, woollen weavers. His formal education was minimal, being chiefly received at Bagslate and Bamford Sunday schools. The poverty of the family was exacerbated by the intemperance of the father, who, however, reformed later in life. On 15 October 1832 Ashworth married Jane Thornber, only daughter of William and Jane Thornber of Cutlane Farm, near Cutgate. The marriage was happy, though marked by years of struggle and poverty. Ashworth unwisely ventured into shopkeeping with few resources of his own, and the couple's lives were troubled by constant indebtedness. They had five children, two sons and one daughter surviving infancy. Ashworth's position improved when he returned to the textile trade in which he had been trained. He eventually flourished as a manufacturer, but by this time his first wife was dead. He remarried; his second wife was Hannah, daughter of Joseph Wood of Rochdale.<br>
<br>In 1851, when visiting the Great Exhibition, Ashworth decided to found a chapel for the destitute in Rochdale. Discouraged by his friends, he abandoned the project for a time, and did not put it into execution until 1858. As minister of this independent chapel he was brought into close contact with the town's poorest people. He was a vigorous preacher, orthodox in doctrine, and, because he knew the people's way of life and spoke a language which they understood, he gathered a large congregation. Ashworth was a liberal in politics, a staunch teetotaller, an uncompromising advocate of the Maine law, and a strict sabbatarian. He visited the United States and the Holy Land, and for many years had a busy life as preacher, manufacturer, lecturer, and author.<br>
<br>Ashworth wrote <span class="italic">Walks in Canaan</span> (1869) and <span class="italic">Back from Canaan</span> (1873), and had begun an account of his <span class="italic">Rambles in the New World</span> when death overtook him. His chief work, however, was the series <span class="italic">Strange Tales</span> (5 vols., 1863&#150;74), followed by a similar gathering, <span class="italic">Simple Records</span> (1871&#150;3). The combined circulation of these short works was considerable; there were translations into Welsh, French, Dutch, Russian, and Spanish. Although these narratives have little literary polish, they are of interest for their depiction of the life of the poor in nineteenth-century industrial Lancashire. Ashworth mostly related, in straightforward prose, incidents that had come to his knowledge during his work among the poor. His knowledge of the class he described gives <span class="italic">Strange Tales</span> a value beyond that of most religious tracts. Ashworth died on 26 January 1875 at Broadfield, Rochdale, and was followed to his grave in Rochdale cemetery on 30 January by a procession of the poor among whom he had worked.<br>
