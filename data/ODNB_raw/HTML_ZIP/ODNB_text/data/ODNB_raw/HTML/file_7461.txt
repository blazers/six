<span class="headword">Dell,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1669), <span class="occ">ejected minister and educational reformer</span>, was admitted sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in April 1624; there is no reliable information about his early life. He graduated BA in 1628 and MA in 1631, subsequently becoming a fellow. With the support of Oliver St John, first earl of Bolingbroke, on 20 February 1641 he was instituted rector of Yielden (sometimes Yelden), Bedfordshire, a benefice worth some &pound;200 a year. His first published work, <span class="italic">Power from on High</span> (1645), was dedicated to Elizabeth St John, countess of Bolingbroke, whom he thanked for supporting him through an earlier crisis, perhaps a serious illness.<br>
<br>During the early 1640s Dell was most prominent as chaplain to Sir Thomas Fairfax and the New Model Army, at which time the earliest signs of Dell's controversial nature became apparent: in November 1644 he was sent home as part of Oliver Cromwell's attempt at conciliating the earl of Manchester. He was subsequently recalled, however, and he accompanied the New Model on its key campaigns from Naseby (June 1645) onwards, first as minister to Colonel Sir Miles Hobart's regiment and later as personal chaplain to Fairfax. His contribution climaxed with a sermon to the triumphant army before Oxford, published as <span class="italic">The Building and Glory of the Truely Christian and Spiritual Church</span> (1646), in which the army was his principal example of the lively, spiritual church as opposed to &#145;the forms of the former age&#146;. He officiated at the marriage of General Ireton and Bridget Cromwell at Holton, Oxfordshire, on 15 June 1646. He was awarded &pound;50 by the Commons on 22 June for bringing the news of the surrender of the city of Oxford and went back to consolidate the ideological victory in the pulpits of the city. However, on 27 June he was ordered to appear before the House of Lords to answer accusations made in a paper they had received relating to his sermon at Marston earlier in the month. In July he successfully argued that the charges were too general to stick, but he continued to be the butt of presbyterian attacks. He preached the November 1646 fast sermon to the House of Commons, published as <span class="italic">Right Reformation</span>, complete with an attack on Christopher Love, the presbyterian who had also been preaching that day. He resigned as chaplain to Fairfax in March 1648, but he continued to defend the army &#145;in its ways of Justice and Righteousness&#146;  (title-page) in <span class="italic">The City Ministers Unmask'd</span> (1649).<br>
<br>At the height of his influence Dell was one of the puritan ministers offering spiritual consolation to Charles I before his execution&#151;though his offer was turned down. That year he dedicated to the House of Commons his sermon <span class="italic">The Way of True Peace and Unity in the Churches</span>, in which he argued that congregations should choose their ministers, and the state should keep out of church and theological matters. Dell disliked uniformity in church practice, and made a clear distinction between unity and uniformity, regarding the latter as an inappropriate exercise of power in spiritual matters. This brought him into regular controversy with the presbyterians, most notably Thomas Edwards, who in the third part of <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> accused him of sedition, and Samuel Rutherford, whose <span class="italic">Survey of the Spirituall Antichrist</span> (1648) argued that Dell's emphasis on inward religion was antinomian: &#145;Come and learn at Mr <i>Del</i>, <i>to keepe</i> the heart right, and violate all the ten commandments&#146;  (p. 31). Dell's tract <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Baptisms</span> (1652), for example, argues that any kind of water baptism is irrelevant to the spiritual baptism of Christ; as late as 1832 this was being republished by Quakers, though Dell had no leanings towards Quakerism himself. It is not clear how thorough-going he was in putting his convictions into practice. By the early 1650s he had married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1681), whose other name is unknown. Of their seven children the names of Anne (16 December 1653), Nathaniel (16 May 1655), and Mercy (16 February 1657) appear in the baptismal registers of Yielden, while that of John (<i>b</i>. 1652/3) does not. This may indicate that he changed his mind, or simply that baptismal registers in the Commonwealth were used as records of births. Dell's indifference to ceremony is illustrated by the complaint his parishioners made to the House of Lords on 20 June 1660 that in 1659 he had not celebrated communion at Christmas, but had let John Bunyan, a tinker, preach to them; this is of a piece with his earlier encouragement of &#145;mechanic preachers&#146; in the army. Yet his policy on baptism was not the only one vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy: he preached against tithes but still took them, and the same ambivalence characterized his second university career.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1649 Dell was intruded as master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. During his early years he appears to have been active in managing the college, including the chapel, but less so as his term progressed. On the evidence of the college gesta book, he appears to have been present at key moments in the college's life, but not ordinarily resident, although he managed to get his salary augmented. In the early 1650s he preached controversial sermons in the university church and town on the role of learning, arguing that understanding scripture was a spiritual gift, and that &#145;humane learning&#146; was a positive hindrance, involving the corrupting study of pagan authors. This was in response to a commencement sermon by his fellow Independent Sydrach Simpson, now master of Pembroke, who had argued for a learned ministry. Dell argued that universities should stop awarding divinity degrees; the syllabus led its candidates astray, the concept of degrees was unacceptably hierarchical in the church, and their existence served to mislead people who took them as marks of holiness. In <span class="italic">The Stumbling Stone</span> (1653) he argues &#145;there needs nothing to the ministry of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> but only God's pouring out his Spirit&#146;  (p. 24). In an appendix to <span class="italic">The Tryal of Spirits</span> (1653), &#145;The right reformation of learning&#146;, he made further proposals for the reformation of education: that the civil power should provide schools in every town and village in the Commonwealth, and that there should be a university in each major town to reduce the hold of Oxford and Cambridge, teaching the liberal arts, mathematics, medicine, and law (though not divinity, of course) to a much wider constituency. Dell's emphasis, like that of many of the antinomian commentators on education at the time, such as John Webster, Gerard Winstanley, and George Fox, is on learning that might be useful to the Commonwealth. For these views he was attacked by Simpson, and in an appendix to Seth Ward's <span class="italic">Vindiciae academiarum</span> (1654). In 1657 he was active, along with John Donne, the minister of Pertenhall in Bedfordshire, in collecting a petition against the second protectorate parliament, published as <span class="italic">The Humble and Serious Testimony</span>. Dell's disappointment with his one-time allies was thus political as well as spiritual.<br>
<br>Dell resigned his mastership on 11 May 1660, just before the Restoration. Following the hostile petition of his Yielden parishioners on 20 June, he was ejected from his living; his successor was instituted on 4 January 1661. While there were some disputes over college property near his lands in Westoning, south of Bedford, where he lived in retirement, his correspondence from that period seems genial and cheerful. He died on 5 November 1669 and was buried in his own land two days later. He was survived by his wife, Martha, and six of his children. Some years later, during the exclusion crisis of 1681, his <span class="italic">Increase of Popery</span> was published.<br>
<br>Dell was a key figure in the development of antinomian religion in the 1640s and 50s, though he quotes most often from Luther, and regarded himself as the heir of Wycliff and Hus as well. His influence lasted more than a century after his death, though ironically among Quakers rather than the heirs of the Independents with whom he was most closely associated. Richard Baxter, who had earlier been alarmed at Dell's influence in the army, wrote that he was &#145;one, who took reason, sound doctrine, order and concord to be the intolerable maladies of Church and State, because they were the greatest strangers to his mind&#146;  (quoted in Walker). The evidence of his writing, and what survives of his charismatic preaching, suggests that his reforming ideas were more substantial than that verdict suggests; but it does show Dell's talent for making enemies.<br>
