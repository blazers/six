<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackmore,  Richard Doddridge</span>  (1825&#150;1900), <span class="occ">novelist and fruit farmer</span>, was born on 7 June 1825, at the vicarage, Longworth, Berkshire, the third but second surviving son of the Revd John Blackmore (1794&#150;1858) and his first wife, Anne Basset Knight (1794&#150;1825). Anne was the eldest daughter of the Revd Robert Knight (<i>bap</i>. 1764, <i>d</i>. 1819), vicar of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and of Bayton, Worcestershire, and his second wife, Harriet Mercy Humphreys (1769&#150;1846), after whose maternal grandfather, the nonconformist minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7746/', "Philip Doddridge (1702&#150;1751)")</script>, Richard was named.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>John Blackmore had been curate-in-charge of Longworth, a few miles south-west of Oxford, since 1820, and supplemented his income by coaching undergraduates. However, before Richard was three months old, typhus struck the village and carried off, among other members of the household, his mother and her twin sister. The baby Richard and his elder brother, Henry (1824&#150;1875), were taken in charge by his mother's younger sister Mary Frances Knight (<i>bap</i>. 1797, <i>d</i>. 1878), whom he described as &#145;my dearest relative (who was my mother till I got a step one)&#146;  (R. Blackmore to Mrs Halliday, 1 July 1875, cited in Dunn, 27). Much of his early childhood was spent with her at the home of his maternal grandmother and uncles at Newton Nottage, Glamorgan, on the north shore of the Bristol Channel. His bereaved father, who had left Longworth after the tragedy, moved back to King's Nympton in his native Devon in 1832. Blackmore also used to visit his paternal grandfather, the Revd John Blackmore (1764&#150;1842), who lived at Combe Martin, in north-west Devon, but held another cure at Oare on the north edge of Exmoor. All these remote and beautiful places were later to feature largely in his fiction, which was haunted by the figure of the homeless orphan baby, and was also coloured by an enthusiasm for antiquarianism and natural history encouraged by his mother's brother the Revd Henry Hey Knight (1795&#150;1857).<br>
<br>In November 1831 Blackmore's father married his second wife, Charlotte Ann Platt; they were to have two daughters and a son. This event, which was followed by Mary Knight's marriage to the Revd Richard Gordon in July 1832, meant that the Blackmore boys again had a permanent home with their father. In 1833 Richard was at Squier's Grammar School, South Molton, Devon, and in 1833&#150;4 at the King's School, Bruton, Somerset. In August 1837 he went to Blundell's School, Tiverton, Devon, where his father had been before him, and where he himself was to send John Ridd, the hero of his most famous novel. His brother did not go with him. Tiverton is some 10 miles east of Culmstock, the village in the Blackdown hills where John Blackmore was curate-in-charge from 1835 to 1841, and Blackmore lived in the town during the week and returned home for Sunday. He lodged with two older boys, Frederick Temple (1821&#150;1902), later archbishop of Canterbury, and his younger brother John, sons of an impoverished widow living at Culmstock; when they left the school in March 1839 Blackmore became a boarder. During his time at Blundell's the day boys, who were educated by the foundation, were subject to appalling persecution by the fee-paying boarders (in 1847 a public scandal led to reform). Blackmore's treatment is sometimes said to have caused his lifelong epilepsy. The main authority for Blackmore's sufferings at Blundell's is F. J. Snell, whose father had been at school with him: he claims that Frederick Temple used to hit him on the head with a hammer, and that Blackmore was given a nickname so vile as to be &#145;too brutally frank for mature ears&#146;  (Snell, &#145;Richard Doddridge Blackmore&#146;, 155). However the picture Blackmore gives of Blundell's in <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> is not a wholly antagonistic one, and his old-fashioned grammar school education laid the foundation for his lifelong devotion to the classics. He became head boy of the school, and gained a school scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, where he went at the end of 1843 and where he was happy. He graduated with a second-class degree in classics in 1847, and after a short time as a tutor decided to study law; he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in June 1852, and is said to have practised as a conveyancer for some years.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandnewcareer"></a>Marriage and new career</h2>On 8 November 1853 at Holy Trinity Church, Gray's Inn Road, London, without the knowledge or approval of his family, Blackmore married Lucy Maguire or McGuire (1822?&#150;1888) of Guernsey, who was a Roman Catholic born in Dublin, and whose father, Edmond Paul Maguire, is unilluminatingly described on the marriage certificate as a government secretary. Her mother, Margaret Lynch, is listed in the 1841 census as a laundress. It is said by S. J. Reid that Blackmore had first met her as an undergraduate, while with a college reading party in Jersey which was boarding in her family's house. The marriage proved happy, though childless; Lucy Blackmore became a member of the Church of England, and friendly relations between the couple and the Revd John Blackmore had been established before the latter's death in 1858. Religious and social barriers between lovers were to be a frequent motif in Blackmore's fiction, notably in <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span>. The marriage certificate also gives Blackmore's profession as &#145;writer for the press&#146;, which suggests that, like many briefless barristers of the time, he had taken to journalism. It has been said that Blackmore's decision to abandon his career at the bar was connected to his fear of having an epileptic fit in court, rather than a result of any lack of success as a lawyer. Whatever the truth of this, in 1855 he joined the staff of Wellesley House grammar school, Twickenham. Hitherto he and his wife had lived in lodgings in Rochester Square, Camden Town; they now moved to Hampton Wick. In 1857 Henry Hey Knight died and left him enough money to give up teaching, which he is said to have disliked, and buy some land at nearby Teddington, where he built a house, called Gomer House after a favourite dog, planted an orchard, and set up as a market gardener.<br>
<br>Blackmore's fruit farming was his main occupation for the rest of his life, although, perhaps because of his high standards, he lost more money than he made. Even after he had become a successful novelist, he wrote that &#145;All the time that I can spare from the pen is occupied by the more congenial trowel&#146;  (R. Blackmore to Paul H. Hayne, 31 May 1884, cited in Burris, 177). He became an accepted authority on fruit growing, contributing articles on the subject to several reference books, and in September 1894 took part in a fierce controversy in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the relative merits of British and Californian fruit. From 1883 until 1892 he served on the fruit and vegetable committee of the Royal Horticultural Society.<br>
<br>The apparently abrupt change of tack from teaching schoolboys Latin and Greek to growing apples and pears should be seen in connection with Blackmore's interest in an ideal of rural life. One of his earlier publications was <span class="italic">The farm and fruit of old: a translation in verse of the first and second georgics of Virgil, by a market gardener</span> (1862), and his greatest success as a novelist was with an idyll of seventeenth-century Devon, whose hero is also both a classicist and a farmer. Blackmore had always dreamed of &#145;a house in the country encompassed by a large garden&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>): in his novels he was again and again to depict a version of the Horatian Happy Man, farming and gardening in obscure domestic bliss in England in the seventeenth, eighteenth, or early nineteenth centuries. He translated Theocritus and Horace as well as Virgil, and allusions to classical literature and mythology pervade his work. It is hard to assess whether the exigencies of farming fruit (which frost or wind may spoil from one day to the next) developed in Blackmore the passionate interest in weather which is so marked a feature of his fiction, or whether his choice of occupation was determined by a pre-existing obsession with the subject.<br>
<br>Blackmore's earliest publications were all verse: two volumes under the pseudonym Melanter (&#145;more black&#146; in Greek), appeared in 1854, and in the following year a patriotic poem on the Crimean War, <span class="italic">The Bugle of the Black Sea: the Fate of Franklin</span> (1860), was published under his own name. None of them caught the public attention, and even when he did turn to publishing prose fiction, he had no success for some years. <span class="italic">Clara Vaughan</span> (1864), the story of a girl who grows up hoping to revenge her father's murder, is an autobiographical narrative, partly set in Camden Town, with some effective passages of lush description of nature in north Devon and Corsica, and a complicated plot involving an Italian vendetta. Inspector Cutting is an early literary portrait of a police detective. The book came out in the heyday of the sensation novel, and some reviewers detected the hand of a woman author; Blackmore later defended himself against the charge of having imitated Mary Braddon's <span class="italic">Eleanor's Victory</span> (3 vols., 1863), another novel about a woman revenging her father's murder. His next novel, <span class="italic">Cradock Nowell: a Tale of the New Forest</span>, was serialized (1865&#150;6), and, Blackmore wrote, &#145;spoiled by <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>. I was repeatedly interfered with, and never left to my own course&#146;  (R. Blackmore to Nelson Fedden, 17 Feb 1873, cited in Dunn, 116). It appeared in one volume in 1866; a much revised version was published in 1873. Like <span class="italic">Clara Vaughan</span>, it was set in the present day.<h2>
<a name="LornaDoone"></a>Lorna Doone</h2>For his third novel, <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span>, begun in February 1865, Blackmore drew on legends and tales circulating in Devon and Somerset associated with the area of north-east Exmoor which he knew from his childhood visits to his Blackmore grandfather, and set his novel in the late seventeenth century, against the background of Monmouth's uprising. John Ridd, a yeoman farmer, recounts the story of his courtship of Lorna, kidnapped as a baby by the outlawed Doones, and brought up in their Exmoor fastness, half-captive, half-queen. The hidden combe becomes a symbolic landscape of initiation and sexual awakening; Lorna is an English Persephone: intermittently visible, shedding her sweetness over the fertile landscape. Her marriage to John symbolizes the appropriation of aristocratic power by the hard-working middle class, while the picture of plenitude and rural festivity at Plovers Barrows offers a fantasy of English communal life in the shadow of war and corrupt government. The first edition of the book did not sell particularly well, but the one-volume cheap edition of 1870 became a best-seller; Blackmore himself believed the story that its sales were boosted by the announcement in October 1870 of the engagement of Princess Louise to the marquess of Lorne (in the novel Lorna is supposed to be descended from the earls of Lorne). Combining romance, adventure, and idyll, <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> has been continuously in print since its publication, though its wide currency among schoolchildren is probably a thing of the past. Like <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> and <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span>, however, it circulated in the twentieth century to a very large extent in abridged and simplified versions (<span class="italic">BL cat.</span> lists nineteen), not only because of its length and its plentiful digressions, and the fact that the story is filtered through a highly self-conscious and ironic retrospective narrative, but because of the striking difficulty of its language, which abounds in archaic and dialect words and literary and historical allusions. There have been three BBC television versions (in 1963, 1976, and 2000) and seven film versions since 1911, the latest, directed by Andrew Grieve (GB 1990, Working Title), starring Sean Bean as Carver Doone and Billie Whitelaw as Mrs Ridd.<br>
<br>None of Blackmore's other novels ever approached the aesthetic or commercial success of <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span>, but his next novel, <span class="italic">The Maid of Sker</span> (3 vols., 1872), was his own favourite. It is set during the late eighteenth century on both sides of the Bristol Channel, in Newton Nottage and north Devon. Blackmore's intimate knowledge of the localities, his close observation of nature, and his lyrical celebration of weather (a hurricane, a sandstorm), give the story (another lost baby inheritance plot) colour and drama. The narrative is facetiously and bombastically recounted by an untrustworthy Welsh fisherman, Davy Llewelyn. This narrative technique resembles to some extent the subtle use of John Ridd's voice in <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span>, without being as successful. Perhaps Blackmore was influenced here by the sentimental comic novels of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, <span class="italic">The Caxtons</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">My Novel</span> (1853), of which he wrote &#145;The Caxton series form to my mind the grandest production of the century&#146;  (R. Blackmore to Mrs Halliday, 16 Dec 1876, cited in Dunn, 163). The plot of <span class="italic">The Maid of Sker</span> is driven by the machinations of the sinister Parson Chowne, one of the worst of Blackmore's many villains, who gets his just deserts by catching hydrophobia and being strangled by a fellow clergyman. The heroine Bardie, a baby found in a boat by Davy, whose baby talk is lovingly recounted, is known to have been based by Blackmore on a niece of his wife's named Eva Pinto Leite (1866&#150;1911), who was practically adopted by the childless Blackmores, and kept house for him after Lucy's death.<h2>
<a name="Privategriefandothernovels"></a>Private grief and other novels</h2>In 1875 Blackmore's brother Henry, a lonely eccentric who, adopting the name of a remote ancestor of the Knights, had changed his name in 1852 to Henry John Turberville, died in a hotel in Yeovil, having made a will leaving his substantial property to the family of the local chemist, to whose daughter he had been engaged. An autopsy revealed the presence of cyanide, and Blackmore made allegations which led to both the chemist's and the doctor's beginning libel proceedings against him. Objections were raised (on grounds of unsound mind and undue influence) by both Blackmore, as next-of-kin and heir-at-law, and the beneficiaries of several earlier wills (who included the atheist and radical Charles Bradlaugh, 1833&#150;1891); after involving Blackmore in a good deal of anxiety the case ended in compromise.<br>
<br>Blackmore's next novel, <span class="italic">Alice Lorraine: a Tale of the South Downs</span> (3 vols., 1875), an ambitious attempt to depict an early nineteenth-century English Antigone, was so badly reviewed he briefly resolved to abandon novel writing, but a steady stream of novels continued to flow from his pen, and although they never made as much money for him or their publishers as <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> had, he was able to place them as serials and obtain good prices. <span class="italic">Cripps, the Carrier: a Woodland Tale</span> (3 vols., 1876) is set near Oxford in the winter of 1837&#150;8 and mingles pastoral with satire on the Tractarians. Like many British writers of the time Blackmore resented the piracy of his books in America, but he engaged in cordial correspondence with several of his American fans, and, though he had never visited the United States, or indeed it appears any other foreign country, he made California the setting of <span class="italic">Erema, or, My Father's Sin</span> (3 vols., 1877), in which, perhaps partly under the influence of his friend the Georgia poet Paul H. Hayne (1830&#150;1886), he gives a sympathetic depiction of the Southern cause. In 1879, shortly after the death of his aunt Mary Gordon, he published anonymously the poem, &#145;Dominus illuminatio mea&#146;, which, placed by Arthur Quiller-Couch at the end of his best-selling <span class="italic">Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250&#150;1900</span> (1900), achieved fame, although it was not credited to Blackmore for many years. <span class="italic">Mary Anerley: a Yorkshire Tale</span> (3 vols., 1880), is one of his best novels, again patterned as a search for identity and nourishing communal and domestic life, in this case by the lost baby turned outlaw and smuggler Robin Lyth who loves the heroine, a farmer's daughter. <span class="italic">The Remarkable History of Sir Thomas Upmore</span> (2 vols., 1884) was an unsuccessful satire, incorporating Blackmore's increasingly choleric views on Gladstonian Liberalism. <span class="italic">Christowell: a Dartmoor Tale</span> (3 vols., 1882), is one of several novels named after a village and structured as a portrait of a community; its hero has retreated to an inaccessible house and garden to escape a false reputation for cowardice obtained in the Peninsular War. Another is <span class="italic">Springhaven</span> (3 vols., 1887), admired by many of his fans, a naval tale of the Napoleonic wars, set on the Sussex coast. In some ways an invasion scare story on the model of George Chesney's <span class="italic">The Battle of Dorking</span> (1871), it has a large cast of characters, mostly residents of the eponymous fishing village, but including both Nelson and Napoleon. In January 1888 Lucy Blackmore died, after many years of chronic invalidism; grief affected all Blackmore's subsequent works, especially <span class="italic">Kit and Kitty: a Story of West Middlesex</span> (3 vols., 1890), begun in the year of his bereavement, in which he wrote for the first time about his adopted home the Thames valley, setting the novel in the 1850s and 1860s, when he and Lucy were living in Teddington as a young married couple. Kit's wife disappears unaccountably; he is bereft; after an extraordinary series of events she returns and they live happily ever after; the author portrays himself partly as Kit and partly as Uncle Corney, an elderly and grumpy market gardener. Equally elegiac is <span class="italic">Perlycross: a Tale of the Western Hills</span> (3 vols., 1894) which is, like <span class="italic">Christowell</span> and <span class="italic">Springhaven</span>, an anatomy of an entire community. It is set in a village closely modelled on Culmstock, with a hero, a poor widowed curate, modelled on the author's father, in the year 1835, a golden age before the repeal of the corn laws, when &#145;as yet it was no mockery to cast the fat grain among the clods &hellip; Alas, that thy beauty should be of the past, and ground into gritty foreign flour!&#146;  (pp. 5&#150;6). The village is struck by a violent storm, and social barriers are overcome for the sake of romance. There are also later works of less importance in prose and verse.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>Blackmore never quite had his due from twentieth-century literary critics, although Max Keith Sutton's 1979 study, written under Northrop Frye's influence, convincingly emphasizes the importance of archetypal patterns to the functioning of his novels. At their best his gift for endowing historical fiction with symbolic resonance, his unsurpassed observation of the natural world, his outstanding power of creating unforgettable visual images (John saving the sheep in <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span>, the church struck by lightning in <span class="italic">Christowell</span>), give his novels qualities which compensate for their lack of organization and their needlessly crabbed language. Blackmore's books do not respond well to fast reading. His superficial nostalgia and conservatism have not recommended him to academic readers and have obscured his deceptively complex narrative techniques and his interest in marshalling a wide variety of mutually contradictory points of view.<br>
<br>Blackmore's own tastes in literature as well as politics were conservative; he was no enthusiast for realism in fiction; nor on the other hand was the late-Victorian flowering of the adventure novel to his taste: he particularly disliked the work of Rider Haggard. But he admired and was on good terms with Hardy, and had a considerable influence on younger regional novelists, such as Hall Caine and Eden Phillpotts. Though there are many witnesses to his charm of manner and generosity, it is hard to avoid the impression that he was sometimes irascible and exacting, especially with his employees. There was a gardener who sabotaged his vines in revenge for being dismissed, and there were housekeeping difficulties (though Blackmore did not take up the offer of help recruiting domestic staff which was made by his lifelong friend Arthur Munby). Throughout his time at Teddington he maintained a running battle with his neighbours the London and South Western Railway Company. After his wife's death he became increasingly infirm and seldom moved far from home. He died at Gomer House, of abdominal cancer, on 20 January 1900 and was buried at Teddington cemetery. There is a memorial in Exeter Cathedral, with a verse inscription by Munby, and a statue of Lorna in Dulverton, while on Exmoor the tourists are still sold postcards of Doone country.<br>
