<span class="headword">Wimbush,  Mary</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 19 March 1924, at 60 Carlton Avenue, Kenton, Middlesex, the daughter of (Nelson) Norman Wimbush, schoolmaster and lecturer in economics for London county council, and his wife, Ida Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hughes. The family moved to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, when she was four. Her mother had attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and her father (who was facially disfigured in the First World War) was keen on amateur dramatics. She was educated at the Masonic School, Bushey, Berkhamsted School for Girls, and the convent school of St Agnes and St Michael, East Grinstead, Sussex, before training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, London. Leaving a few months before the Second World War ended, she joined ENSA to give entertainment to servicemen along the south coast, at a time when flying bombs were frequently overhead&#151;an experience she found unnerving as she never knew when they were going to &#145;cut out and fall on you&#146;, as she put it years later  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 2 Nov 2005).<br>
<br>Wimbush began her peacetime acting career at Amersham repertory theatre and on 29 June 1946 married, as his second wife, the already well-known actor Howard Francis Marion-Crawford (1914&#150;1969), who was then frequently employed by BBC producers in the Home Service and the new Third Programme. He was the son of Howard Francis Marion-Crawford, a lieutenant in the Irish Guards. They had one son, Charles. After her marriage Mary Wimbush (who continued acting under her maiden name) was soon also appearing on BBC radio, including in one of the first radio soap operas, <span class="italic">Mrs Dale's Diary</span>; the connection with the BBC Drama Repertory Company lasted into the 1970s and she did other radio work for the rest of her life. Her marriage to Howard Marion-Crawford ended in divorce in 1954. Four years later, from 1958 until his death, she was the lover of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34808/', "(Frederick) Louis MacNeice (1907&#150;1963)")</script>, who dedicated his last book of poems to her. She declined to participate in a BBC programme in which their relationship was discussed years later, a diffidence that was lived out in a modest cottage near Sherborne, Dorset, which for a long time was her home: she said that she was lucky in that she needed little in life except her work.<br>
<br>As a radio performer Wimbush's range was wide. She was cast as the heroine in H. L. V. Fletcher's drama <span class="italic">The Storm</span> in 1961, and the drama producer Audrey Cameron cast her in two Margery Allingham adaptations, <span class="italic">Look to the Lady</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">Black Plumes</span> (1964). But she could also be easily cast in the lighter roles of Alan Melville, such as <span class="italic">At Your Service</span> (1976). Auburn-haired and blue-eyed, hers was virtually an unknown face (as distinct from voice) until, in 1969, she appeared as the &#145;universal mother&#146; character Mary Smith in Richard Attenborough's film of <span class="italic">Oh! What a Lovely War</span>. She got the part because Attenborough remembered that, years before, they had both been in a radio play in which she had played a mother who had to be told by her doctor that her son was dead. &#145;Every time she went through the scene, even at rehearsal, just standing by a microphone with a script in her hand, she made me cry&#146;, remembered Attenborough. &#145;I promised myself that if ever I were able to offer her a job, I would.&#146; Her own reaction to the job was less flamboyant: &#145;Now at last they can see what I look like!&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 2 Nov 2005).<br>
<br>Wimbush's next films, <span class="italic">Fragment of Fear</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">Vampire Circus</span> (1972), and her television work in the 1970s and 1980s, including <span class="italic">Lady Killer</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Fall of Eagles</span>, and <span class="italic">Country Matters</span> (both 1974), were less notable, but her regular television appearances as Prudie Paynter in the Winston Graham series <span class="italic">Poldark</span> (1975&#150;6) for the first time made her a prominent figure in British television. Meanwhile she was establishing herself on the stage across a wide range of parts and venues, including working for the National Theatre as the Duchess of York in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> and Mrs Sorby in <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span>; creating Edna Shaft in Simon Gray's <span class="italic">Butley</span> in the West End; and at Birmingham Repertory Theatre playing the loyal wife of Sir Thomas More in <span class="italic">A Man for All Seasons</span>, Queen Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Clara in J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">When we are Married</span>, and the Countess of Henslowe in <span class="italic">Elizabeth Rex</span>. In a production of <span class="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</span>, at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, she played Miss Mackay.<br>
<br>Nevertheless it was radio, and in particular the highly popular and long-running soap opera <span class="italic">The Archers</span>, that was to utilize to the full Wimbush's flair for strong-voiced roles with flashes of humour, and crown her career. She began in <span class="italic">The Archers</span> in 1965 by playing the village schoolteacher Elsie Catcher, but that character retired in 1967 and it was not until two years later that she was recalled to the programme as the snobbish Lady Isabel Lander&#151;until she too was written out. In 1992 she became Nigel Pargetter's over-assertive, manipulative mother Julia Pargetter, who for a time takes to drink before reforming. This was a character Wimbush expected to die off or otherwise disappear, but the outcome was rather different, and the character was killed off only after Wimbush's own death. Wimbush was able to use her distinctive voice to create a memorably pretentious character from a very ordinary background whose son was the heir to Lower Loxley Hall and whose vulnerability made her just tolerable. The actress herself maintained that she had found the character most stimulating to play when she was on the bottle, but Julia Pargetter was a survivor like the actress who played her.<br>
<br>In 1991 Wimbush won the Sony Radio award for best actress for her performances in <span class="italic">The Horse's Mouth</span> and <span class="italic">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</span>, and two years later played Lady Edith in <span class="italic">The Governor's Consort</span>, a role written specifically for her by Peter Tinniswood. She was determined never to retire, and in 2004 was in a two-month tour of Arthur Miller's <span class="italic">The Crucible</span>. &#145;I intend to go on enjoying myself to the last&#146;, she said  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>, 4 Oct 2004). She was taken ill with a retroperitoneal haemorrhage at the BBC Birmingham studios on 31 October 2005 after playing Julia Pargetter in a recording of an episode of <span class="italic">The Archers</span>, and was declared dead at the City Hospital, Winson Green. She was a modest but firm and distinctive favourite of radio, television, and theatre audiences, whose acting career had lasted more than sixty years. She was survived by her son Charles.<br>
