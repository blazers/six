<span class="headword">Mountbatten,  Louis Alexander</span>, first marquess of Milford Haven <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Prince Louis of Battenberg]</span>  (1854&#150;1921), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and his morganatic wife, Countess Julia Theresa von Haucke. He was born Ludwig Alexander at Graz, Austria, on 24 May 1854. The friendship between his mother and Princess Alice, daughter of Queen Victoria and wife of Prince Louis of Hesse (afterwards Grand Duke Louis IV), led to Prince Louis's settling in England as a boy. He was naturalized as a British subject, and entered the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1868, being promoted to lieutenant in 1876 after accompanying the prince of Wales to India. A brief liaison with the society beauty and actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37652/', "Lillie Langtry")</script> resulted in the birth of a daughter, Jeanne-Marie Langtry, in March 1881. To avoid scandal, a financial settlement was made, and Prince Louis was appointed to the <i>Inconstant</i>, on which he served during the Egyptian war, taking part in the bombardment of Alexandria (11 July 1882). After serving on the royal yacht, he was promoted to commander in 1885.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1884 Prince Louis married his cousin Princess Victoria (1863&#150;1950), eldest daughter of Louis, grand duke of Hesse and by Rhine, at Darmstadt. They had two sons and two daughters: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66662/', "George Louis Mountbatten (1892&#150;1938)")</script>, who succeeded in the marquessate; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31480/', "Louis Mountbatten, later Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900&#150;1979)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66337/', "Alice (1885&#150;1969)")</script>, who married Prince Andrew of Greece; and Louise (1889&#150;1965), who became consort of Gustav Adolf VI of Sweden.<br>
<br>At this period British defence policy was undergoing a gradual readjustment in accordance with the theories of what became known as &#145;the blue-water school&#146;, and Prince Louis was selected by the Admiralty to act as naval adviser to the inspector-general of fortifications, with a view to co-ordinating naval and military ideas. He took up this appointment in 1892, having been promoted captain in the preceding year, and held it until October 1894. In February 1894 he became joint secretary of the naval and military committee on defence, afterwards the committee of imperial defence. During these years he studied the defence problem in its naval and military aspects and was well qualified when, in 1900, he was made assistant director of naval intelligence. He returned to the Admiralty in 1902 as director of naval intelligence, and retained that position until 1905, having been promoted to rear-admiral in 1904.<br>
<br>By this time Prince Louis was regarded throughout the service as an officer who had established his fitness for high command at sea. On leaving the Admiralty in 1905 he hoisted his flag in the <i>Drake</i> as rear-admiral commanding the second cruiser squadron. After two years in this post he was selected as second in command of the fleet in the Mediterranean. In the meantime Lord Fisher had become the dominating figure at the Admiralty, and it was no surprise when in 1908 Prince Louis was directed to move to the Atlantic fleet as commander-in-chief. Two years later he was appointed vice-admiral commanding the third and fourth divisions of the newly constituted Home Fleets, and in December 1911 he returned to the Admiralty as second sea lord, becoming first sea lord a year later. This appointment was questionable in view of Prince Louis's German birth, and of the threatening situation which was developing abroad.<br>
<br>In July 1914 a test mobilization of the naval reserves was carried out, and the ships were due to disperse, after carrying out exercises in the English Channel, just as war was becoming increasingly likely. Winston Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, was absent from his office during the critical weekend (25&#150;7 July) when it had to be decided whether the fleet should be dispersed and the reserve ships demobilized (in accordance with the plans already made), or whether preliminary steps should be taken to place the squadrons at their various war stations. This decision rested with the first sea lord. After consulting Churchill, Prince Louis, as he subsequently explained, &#145;directed the secretary, as a first step, to send an Admiralty order by telegraph to the commander-in-chief of the Home Fleets at Portland to the effect that no ship was to leave that anchorage until further orders&#146;. War had not then been declared, but the prevision of the first sea lord ensured that when it became inevitable the navy should be ready. By four o'clock on the morning of 3 August naval mobilization had been completed. The prompt initiative which Prince Louis had exhibited in this emergency did not subsequently shield him from attack on account of his &#145;German origin&#146;. On 29 October 1914, finding his position increasingly untenable, particularly after British losses at sea, he resigned as first sea lord. Distressed at his being made a scapegoat, George V swore him of the privy council. Nevertheless, his family later asserted that his hounding from office was a blow from which he never really recovered.<br>
<br>In July 1917, at the king's request, and in the interests of &#145;Anglicizing&#146; the royal family, Prince Louis relinquished the style and title of serene highness and prince, assumed for himself and his descendants the surname of Mountbatten, and was raised to the peerage of the United Kingdom as marquess of Milford Haven, earl of Medina, and Viscount Alderney. On 22 August 1921 he was made an admiral of the fleet on the retired list, but his health was failing. He died on 11 September 1921 at 42 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London, of heart failure following influenza, and was buried at Whippingham church, on the Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>Prince Louis's connections with other European courts had proved invaluable at times, notably in helping to improve Anglo-Russian relations after the Dogger Bank incident of 1904; and his test mobilization of the British navy in 1914 was vital in preparing the service for the outbreak of war. He was also involved in the invention of various scientific devices, including a cone signalling apparatus, and the introduction of an instrument enabling calculations to be resolved mechanically in naval manoeuvres. His intellectual mind and reserved German manner did not make him popular, but &#145;what he lacked in imagination was more than balanced by industry and attention to detail&#146;  (Hough, 171). Keenly interested in British naval history, he was the first president of the Society of Nautical Research.<br>
