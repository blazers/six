<span class="headword">Warenne,  John  de</span>, sixth earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [earl of Surrey and Sussex, Earl Warenne]</span>  (1231&#150;1304), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28739/', "William (IV) de Warenne, earl of Surrey (d. 1240)")</script>, and Maud, one of five daughters and eventual coheirs of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18126/', "William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke (d. 1219)")</script>, and widow of Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1225). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60821/', "Isabel de Warenne")</script>, founder of Marham Abbey, was his elder sister. <h2>
<a name="Inheritanceearlycareerandmarriage"></a>Inheritance, early career, and marriage</h2>Through his father, Warenne eventually inherited an estate that stretched across England. Centred on the barony of Lewes in Sussex, it included Stamford and Grantham in Lincolnshire; Castle Acre in Norfolk; Conisbrough, Sandal, and Wakefield in Yorkshire; and Reigate in Surrey. Through his mother, he was related to some of the most illustrious families in England and France.<br>
<br>Aged only nine on his father's death in 1240, John de Warenne became a ward of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III")</script>, who gave Peter of Savoy custody of the family lands, but raised the boy at court. In 1246 Henry promised to marry his ward to one of Amadeus of Savoy's daughters, but the match was never made. Instead, in August of the following year Henry arranged for Warenne to marry Henry's own uterine sister, Alice, the daughter of Hugues de Lusignan, count of La Marche and lord of Lusignan and Valence, and of Isabella, daughter of Audemar, count of Angoul&ecirc;me and widow of Henry's father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "King John")</script>. The marriage was part of Henry's policy of enriching his Lusignan relatives, and was accordingly denounced by Matthew Paris, claiming that it was beyond the bride's station. After marrying, Warenne received two extra robes at Christmas, and in 1248 received some of his father's lands.<br>
<br>In the early 1250s Warenne was drawn into the court circle that revolved around the Lusignans and the Lord Edward, eight years younger than Warenne. Brother-in-law of both <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29481/', "William de Valence")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/941/', "Aymer de Lusignan")</script>, Warenne took part, along with William, in the dispute between Aymer, bishop-elect of Winchester, and the archbishop of Canterbury in 1252&#150;3. In 1252 he came of age, and obtained the emoluments of his earldom. In 1254 he was knighted along with the Lord Edward and was with the king in Gascony, where he stood surety for Henry's debts in Bordeaux. The following year Warenne went overseas with William de Valence and the earl of Gloucester. He was also one of the English barons who escorted the young king of Scots, Alexander III, and his wife, Margaret, Henry's daughter, from Edinburgh to Wark-on-Tweed, where they met with Henry, and was present when a new regency council was instituted for Alexander. He accompanied Richard of Cornwall for his coronation as king of the Romans at Aachen in 1257. Warenne's first daughter, Alice, was born in 1251, followed by Isabel in 1253, and his only son, William, in January 1256. Yet his wife died less than a month later, and, perhaps surprisingly, Warenne never remarried.<h2>
<a name="Politicalvacillations"></a>Political vacillations</h2>Like many barons, Warenne changed allegiance several times during the turbulent period of reform that began in 1258, though, doubtless because of his background and upbringing, he most often supported the crown. In 1255 he had been among those barons who protested against the large number of foreigners Henry was bringing into England, but by 1257 he was a member of Edward's retinue, and was also often in the company of his own brother-in-law, William de Valence. When the reform movement coalesced at the Oxford parliament in July 1258, Warenne was one of the twelve chosen from Henry's side (who also included William and Aymer de Lusignan) to help elect a council of fifteen which was to direct the government of the realm. Though he swore to uphold the reforms, he baulked at the order to resume the lands and castles that Henry had given to his Lusignan favourites, and fled with the latter to Aymer's castle of Wolvesey. But Warenne was persuaded to abandon his resistance, and after the Lusignans had surrendered and were banished from the realm, he was one of the barons who escorted them to Dover.<br>
<br>Warenne was in the political affinity that Edward gathered in late 1258 and 1259 to assert his political independence. He stood by Edward when he allied with the earl of Gloucester in March 1259, and later in October witnessed Edward's letter giving support to Gloucester's opponent, Simon de Montfort. The following spring, however, Warenne's loyalty to Edward wavered, and he seems to have been induced to return to Henry's side. At the end of March 1260, Henry authorized payment of a yearly fee to Warenne. When Edward appeared to be preparing to oppose his father in April 1260, Warenne was one of those magnates whom Henry summoned to come armed to London, where he was given lodgings inside the city while Edward was forbidden entry. Any rift between the earl and Edward was soon patched, however. After his reconciliation with his father, Edward travelled overseas to participate in tournaments, taking Warenne and other knights with him. Warenne had probably returned to England by 17 February 1261, when Henry summoned him and twenty-six other magnates to come armed to London.<br>
<br>Yet, with Henry's assertion of personal power that spring, Warenne once again sided with Simon de Montfort, along with Warenne's half-brothers, Roger (III) and Hugh Bigod. They insisted on adherence to the provisions of Oxford, and appealed to Louis IX of France to arbitrate in the dispute. In December, after the resistance had collapsed, Warenne like other opponents was pardoned for his actions. He then went overseas, and returned on 10 March 1263 in the company of Henry of Almain and Henry, son of Simon de Montfort. Simon himself returned from France in April, and assembled a group of young councillors including Warenne, Henry of Almain, and Gilbert de Clare. They met at Oxford, and again insisted on the enforcement of the provisions of Oxford. Warenne was then part of Montfort's army that attacked royalists and occupied the Welsh marches, and was among those summoned in May to come to Worcester armed for war. In August, after Henry III had capitulated to the barons, Warenne was named custodian of Pevensey Castle on the advice of the nobles. As a member of the royal council he was appointed, along with Simon de Montfort, Henry of Almain, and others, to negotiate for peace with Llywelyn ab Iorwerth. At about this time, however, he again changed sides and, with Henry of Almain, Roger and Hugh Bigod, and others, once more joined Edward. On 18 September Warenne received his reward, a heritable grant of all of the Norman lands that he held or that would fall to him within his estate. On 23 September Warenne and Henry of Almain sailed to France in the company of Henry III, Edward, and the queen to meet with King Louis. During December Warenne strengthened his ties to the king and Edward. He served on the royal council, witnessed charters, and received various favours. He was with the royal army that marched on Dover Castle on 3 December, and was listed among the royalists in the letter in which Henry agreed to submit the quarrel over the provisions to Louis's judgment. On 24 December the king appointed him military warden of the counties of Surrey and Sussex.<h2>
<a name="Thebaronswarsandtheiraftermath"></a>The barons' wars and their aftermath</h2>Warenne fought on the king's side throughout the civil war in 1264&#150;5. Along with Roger of Leybourne he commanded Rochester Castle, which Simon de Montfort and his army besieged on 19&#150;26 April. He fought under Edward at the battle of Lewes on 14 May but, when the tide of battle shifted and he saw the ferocity of the baronial attack, he and William de Valence, Gui de Lusignan, and Hugh Bigod fled to Pevensey Castle, and thence overseas. Chroniclers condemned him for his flight, one of them blaming Edward's capture on him. While in France the exiles implored the king of France to aid their cause, and counselled the exiled Queen Eleanor to collect an invasion force. In England the seizure of Warenne's lands was ordered, and on 20 June they were committed to Gloucester's custody, except for the castles of Reigate and Lewes. Warenne's lands in Sussex were given to the younger Simon de Montfort.<br>
<br>Warenne did not return to England until the spring of 1265, as the country moved toward another military showdown. In early May Warenne landed in Pembroke with William de Valence and a force of 120 men, both cavalry and infantry, and they soon joined forces with the earl of Gloucester, who had deserted Montfort. A few weeks later Warenne and Valence sent the prior of Monmouth to meet with the king, who was then with Montfort at Hereford, and to sue for the restoration of their lands, claiming they had been seized unjustly. Henry replied that he was prepared to do justice to anyone and would give them a safe conduct, but added that they would also have to answer for certain trespasses. On 28 May Edward escaped from his captors, and soon linked up with Warenne and Valence. Under Edward's leadership they quickly captured several towns in the marches. On the night of 1&#150;2 August Warenne and Valence accompanied Edward in his surprise attack on Kenilworth, which resulted in the capture of a considerable number of Montfort's noble commanders. Presumably, Warenne was with Edward at the battle of Evesham on 4 August, though the chronicles do not note his role.<br>
<br>Several features of Warenne's formative years stand out. He plunged into the thick of political conflict, but never became a prominent leader for either side. He was most often in the company of a group of coevals related by blood or marriage&#151;the Lord Edward, Henry of Almain, William de Valence, and the Bigods&#151;whose friendship may have been more meaningful to him than political idealism. He seems to have looked to one of his kinsmen&#151;Edward, Henry, or William&#151;for political cues for changes in allegiance. Yet despite his fickle loyalties, he forged a close bond to Edward that lasted throughout his life.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the barons' wars Warenne was called upon to help restore order. He was dispatched to subdue Kent and the Cinque Ports, and brought 200 archers from the weald of Sussex to intimidate London. Warenne and Henry of Almain routed northern rebels led by the earl of Derby. He and William de Valence attacked Bury St Edmunds in an effort to reduce the turmoil and disobedience in East Anglia. In 1267 the king deputed the two men to urge Gloucester to attend parliament, which he had refused to do. In 1268 the king pardoned Warenne for any rebellion against the king and for the actions of his followers. His rewards were not particularly lavish. He received an important wardship, London houses forfeited by Hugh Neville, a promise of &pound;100 of land out of royal escheats, 200 marks in cash, and several Jewish debts. The crown also made some gifts and pardons at his request.<br>
<br>At the parliament of Northampton in June 1268 Warenne, along with Edward, Henry of Almain, William de Valence, and other magnates, vowed to go on crusade. In the end, however, Warenne remained in England. Henry III died on 20 November 1272, and at his funeral four days later Warenne, together with other magnates and prelates, swore loyalty to Edward, who was still on his way back from Palestine. Warenne acted as one of the custodians of the realm, making a new seal, appointing officials, and protecting the king's treasure and peace in Edward's name.<h2>
<a name="Actsofviolence"></a>Acts of violence</h2>Warenne was active and aggressive in asserting his privileges and property rights. In 1253 a royal court convicted him of unjustly enclosing much of the commons around Wakefield, and ordered him to tear down fences he had recently erected. In 1269 he collided with the earl of Lincoln over some pastureland. They mustered private armies, but royal justices determined that the land belonged to Lacy and averted war. A little later Warenne feared he would likewise lose another legal battle, with Alan de la Zouche. Appearing in court at Westminster, the two men exchanged increasingly insulting words until Warenne's followers drew their swords, set on the Zouches, and wounded Alan mortally. Warenne fled to his castle of Reigate, and only agreed to submit to the king's judgment after the earl of Gloucester and Henry of Almain guaranteed his safety. Warenne swore that he attacked Zouche not out of premeditated malice but out of uncontrollable anger. He was pardoned for a fine of 10,000 marks, which was initially to be paid off in instalments of 700 marks a year. The king reduced the annual payments to only 200 marks, but even then Warenne paid very little of the fine, to the consternation of some.<br>
<br>In 1270 the archbishop of York scolded Warenne for levying unheard-of exactions on account of the recent civil war. In 1274 archers and other men of the earl roamed about the lands of Robert d'Aguillon harassing his men and causing general disquiet in the neighbourhood. The inquests of 1274&#150;6 recorded in the hundred rolls reveal &#145;diabolical, innumerable oppressions&#146; by his stewards and bailiffs on manors throughout England  (<span class="italic">Rotuli hundredorum</span>, 1.108). They prevented royal ministers from executing their duties; they levied arbitrary taxes, fines, and tolls; and they imprisoned persons who stood up to the earl or violated his rights. The earl high-handedly exercised liberties without royal warrant and illegally enclosed vast acres. The animals in his well-stocked parks posed a danger to crops in nearby fields, a complaint that Archbishop Pecham echoed in a letter to Warenne asking him to correct the situation. It is little wonder that the chancery rolls are peppered with commissions appointed to hear and determine claims of trespass against the earl's warrens, parks, lands, and animals.<br>
<br>When Edward I undertook a survey of military fees in 1284, Warenne's bailiffs refused to allow the commissioners to enter the earl's liberty, and his tenants refused to respond or appear before them. This background makes understandable the legend of Warenne's defiance of the king's justices in 1279. The story relates that when he was challenged to show by what warrant he held his lands, Warenne held up a rusty sword and declared<blockquote>Here my lords, here is my warrant! My ancestors came with William the Bastard and conquered their lands with the sword, and I shall defend them with the sword against anyone who tries to usurp them. The king did not conquer and subject the land by himself, but our forefathers were partners and co-workers with him. (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough</span>, 216)</blockquote>Reynold de Grey of Ruthin, the justice of Chester, discovered that Warenne meant what he said about defending his lands with the sword, when in 1286&#150;8 Warenne summoned military forces to combat Grey's alleged encroachment in his Welsh lordship.<h2>
<a name="CampaignsinWalesandScotland"></a>Campaigns in Wales and Scotland</h2>Warenne was a prominent military commander in Edward I's wars in Wales and Scotland. He sat on the court that rendered judgment against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1276. He served in Wales in 1276&#150;7 and again in 1282&#150;3, when he captured the castle of Dinas Br&acirc;n. Edward rewarded him with Bromfield and Yale, one of several new lordships carved out of Welsh lands. During the uprising of Rhys ap Maredudd in 1287 he led a contingent to Wales, and was summoned again in 1294 to help reduce the rebellion in north Wales led by Madog ap Llywelyn. True to his character, in 1294 he strenuously, though unsuccessfully, asserted his right to the custody of the temporalities of the bishopric of St Asaph within his Welsh territories during vacancies.<br>
<br>Even during the Welsh wars Warenne was active in Scotland. In 1278 he accompanied Alexander III, king of Scots, to London and sat in parliament when Alexander swore fealty to Edward. Warenne travelled to Scotland with Edward in 1285, and in 1289&#150;90 he served as a royal envoy in the sensitive negotiations for a marriage between Prince Edward and Margaret (the Maid of Norway), designated queen of Scots. He helped negotiate the treaty of Salisbury in the autumn of 1289, and the treaty of Birgham, which set the final terms of the marriage and of future relations between England and Scotland, in July 1290. Warenne was also one of the prince's proctors, and was one of the ambassadors sent to Margaret's father, Erik of Norway. In the discussions that followed Margaret's sudden death in September 1290, Warenne strongly supported the candidacy of his son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1208/', "John Balliol")</script>, to the throne of Scotland.<br>
<br>When Balliol and the Scots rebelled in 1295, Edward entrusted Warenne with the defence of English interests in Scotland, but the earl failed to live up to the confidence placed in him. He performed well at first. In 1295 Edward named Warenne keeper of the sea-coasts, one of the keepers of the northern part of England, and then keeper of Bamburgh Castle. Warenne captured Dunbar Castle on 27 April 1296, a minor battle but one proclaimed as a great victory, so demoralizing to the Scots. He then accompanied Edward on his victorious march through Scotland that summer, and on 3 September was appointed custodian of Scotland. Warenne, however, returned to the north of England, and refused to go back to Scotland when William Wallace's revolt erupted in May 1297, claiming that the weather there was bad for his health. The revolt raged out of control, and Edward ordered Warenne to return and fight. The earl slowly made his way northward and only reached Berwick in July. His grandson, Henry Percy (<i>d</i>. 1314), whom he had sent ahead, met with some success. In August Edward tried to replace Warenne as keeper of Scotland with Brian fitz Count, but Brian claimed that he was too poor to undertake such an expensive responsibility. At the beginning of September Edward firmly enjoined Warenne to stay in Scotland to subdue the rebellion. Warenne marched to Stirling, where a narrow bridge crossed the Forth, with the Scots camped on the opposite side. Warenne tried to negotiate, but Wallace would have nothing of it. Though warned of the danger, Warenne (who was being urged on by the Scottish treasurer, Hugh of Cressingham) decided to push ahead. On the morning of 11 September he overslept, and the advance made a late start. As predicted, the Scots attacked just after a substantial portion of the English and Welsh forces had crossed the bridge and cut them down. Warenne, who had stayed on the other side, ordered that the bridge be destroyed and fled the field, leaving behind a small force to hold the castle. He raced to Berwick, and then to Prince Edward. He was in York by 27 September.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Notwithstanding the ineptitude Warenne had shown, and although one tradition had Edward speak derisively of his character, Edward still placed his trust in the old warrior, now in his mid-sixties, and in December 1297 appointed him captain of an expedition against the Scots. Warenne had not been directly involved in the crisis of 1297, but as a royalist he swore to uphold the <span class="italic">Confirmatio cartarum</span> in November and in January 1298 presided in Edward's name over a parliament at York which confirmed <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. He then led a quick campaign in Scotland and reoccupied Berwick. When Edward returned to England from Flanders, he warmly thanked Warenne for his service in Scotland and ordered him to come to England to discuss the Scottish situation. During the summer of 1298 Warenne served in Scotland, and he fought at Falkirk on 22 July. In November Edward appointed him one of the justices inquiring into the oppressions and misdeeds of forest officials throughout the realm. He was summoned for military service in Scotland once again the following year, and in September attended the banquet celebrating Edward's second marriage. In November the king entrusted Warenne with the custody of the latter's own grandson Edward Balliol, a potential claimant to the throne of Scotland. During the Scottish campaign in 1300, Warenne was given command of the 2nd battalion and was present at the siege of Caerlaverock, and he was summoned to Scotland again in 1301, 1302, and 1303. He died on about 29 September 1304 at Kennington, Kent, where his body lay until 1 December. After Christmas he was buried before the altar of Lewes Priory church. The archbishop of Canterbury conducted the funeral ceremony, with many nobles attending.<br>
<br>Warenne's children had married well, so that he left behind highly ranked grandchildren. His daughter Alice had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21927/', "Henry de Percy (d. 1272)")</script> in 1268, and her son Henry fought along with Warenne in Scotland. Isabel was married in 1279 to John Balliol, who later became king of Scotland. Warenne's only son, William (V), married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1293), daughter of Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1296). Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28735/', "John de Warenne")</script>, was born on 30 June 1286 and baptized on 7 November just weeks before William was accidentally killed in a tournament (according to one chronicler he was murdered by envious rivals). Foreshadowing his role at the elder John's funeral, the archbishop of Canterbury presided at William's entombment before the altar at Lewes. The younger John de Warenne was thus his grandfather's heir.<br>
<br>High-handed and impudent in his dealings with tenants and subjects, John de Warenne seems to have been hesitant and perhaps even pusillanimous on the battlefield and in politics. A man who regularly missed the chances to take a lead in national life to which his high ancestry might appear to have entitled him, he became rather a symbol of a crude conservatism, given apt expression in the story of his defiance of the king's justices.<br>
