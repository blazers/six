<span class="headword">Lancaster,  William Joseph Cosens</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Harry Collingwood]</span>  (1843&#150;1922), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 23 May 1843 at Concord Place, Weymouth, Dorset (most references except his birth certificate give his date of birth as 1851). He was the oldest son of Captain William Lancaster, a master mariner, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cosens. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where he won a number of prizes and joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, aged fifteen. Defective eyesight meant that Lancaster had to abandon a career in the navy; instead, he qualified as a civil engineer. He specialized in sea and harbour work and hydrology. In this capacity he travelled widely and in the course of his work visited the Baltic and the Mediterranean, the East and West Indies, and the coasts of Africa. At one stage in his career he lived for eight years in Natal. In York, on 10 July 1878, he married Kezia Hannah Rice Oxley (<i>b</i>. 1850/51), the daughter of George Oxley, a provisions dealer. They reportedly had one son although little else is known of Lancaster's private life, and his death was registered by a nephew, Harold G. Smellie.<br>
<br>Lancaster began to write his sea stories for boys in 1878 and continued to do so for the next forty years, publishing over fifty books for boys altogether. He always wrote under the pseudonym Harry Collingwood (the name chosen out of admiration for Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, Nelson's second-in-command at Trafalgar). Lancaster's books were &#145;widely appreciated by many thousands of young readers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 June 1922). His travels as a civil engineer in sea and harbour work provided him with authentic background material for his stories. Although most of his boys' stories were about the sea, he also wrote several about flying. His first book was <span class="italic">The Secret of the Sands</span> (1879), which was followed over the years by such titles as <span class="italic">Voyage of the &#145;Aurora&#146;</span> (1885), <span class="italic">The Rover's Secret</span> (1888), <span class="italic">The Pirate Slaver</span> (1895), <span class="italic">An Ocean Chase</span> (1898), <span class="italic">With Airship and Submarine</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">A Middy of the Slave Squadron</span> (1910).<br>
<br>Lancaster was a keen sportsman and enjoyed swimming, shooting, riding, and cycling. Like his more famous contemporary, G. A. Henty, he was also a keen yachtsman and racer as well as a yacht designer. His other hobbies included watercolour painting, photography, and music. He died at 40 Liverpool Road, Chester, on 10 June 1922 and was buried in the city on the 15th; he was survived by his wife.<br>
