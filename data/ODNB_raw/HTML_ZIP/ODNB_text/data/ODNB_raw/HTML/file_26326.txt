<span class="headword">Stanton <span class="st"> [Staunton]</span>,  Hervey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1327), <span class="occ">justice and administrator</span>, was probably born at Stanton in Suffolk, about 9 miles north-east of Bury St Edmunds, the son of Nicholas of Stanton, a freeholder there. The abbey of Bury St Edmunds probably provided him with part of his education. He may also have attended the University of Cambridge. Stanton probably then entered the service of John of Northwold, abbot of Bury. He received his first living (Great Saxham) at Northwold's presentation in 1288, and when the abbot went abroad in 1290 Stanton was one of his general attorneys. He then became a clerk of the common bench, perhaps as early as 1291 and certainly by 1293. The law reports show him playing an active role in the hearing of litigation along with the justices of the court from 1293 onwards. The crown started to entrust him with administrative responsibilities in 1297, and he began to receive appointments to special oyer and terminer commissions in 1301. In the winter of 1300&#150;01 he went on a trip to the Roman curia and when his old patron John of Northwold died in 1301, he acted as one of his executors.<br>
<br>Stanton was appointed a justice of the Cornwall eyre in 1302 and in 1303 he became a regular assize justice in the south and south-west of England. In 1304 he travelled overseas with the future Edward II. He was appointed a justice of the common bench in April 1306 and remained one of its justices until Easter term 1313, when he was commissioned to head the eyre of Kent. When the eyre was over he did not return to the common bench but began a new phase of his career in the exchequer. He served as a baron until 1316 and then as chancellor of the exchequer until the summer of 1326. During this period he also presided as chief justice at the London eyre of 1321, and served for less than a year in 1323&#150;4 as a temporary chief justice of king's bench. His tenure of the office of chief justice of the common bench (during Michaelmas term 1326) was even briefer. He was attacked by a city mob, no doubt moved by bitter memories of the deeply unpopular eyre of 1321, while attending a meeting of the council at Blackfriars in London in October 1326. He seems then to have withdrawn to his prebend in York Minster (Husthwaite, granted in 1319), which is where he probably died early in November 1327 (on either the 2nd or the 5th).<br>
<br>Stanton must have inherited some of the lands in Stanton and the neighbouring villages of Hepworth and Bardwell which he resettled in 1310 on himself in fee tail, with successive remainders over, also in fee tail, to his eventual heir (Alexander Walsham, the son of his father's sister, Avice) and various others, perhaps more distant relatives. At the same time he made a similar resettlement of lands at Felsted and elsewhere in Essex, most of which he had bought for 500 marks in 1297. Hervey also acquired a substantial holding in Pakenham and elsewhere in Suffolk from John, son of William of Pakenham, in or before 1306, but may have been acting in co-operation with the abbey of Bury in doing so. In 1307 the abbey acquired a reversion to this holding after his death. It then gave him a life interest in the Bury manor in his home village of Stanton in return for immediate possession of these lands. In 1317 Stanton acquired the London house at Aldersgate that had previously belonged to chief justice Roger Brabazon, who died in that year.<br>
<br>During the last years of his life Stanton founded the Cambridge college of Michaelhouse (later absorbed into Trinity) and drew up statutes for his new foundation. He also bequeathed vestments, relics, and devotional and religious books to the college. He chose to be buried in the church of St Michael in Cambridge, whose advowson he had acquired and given to his college.<br>
