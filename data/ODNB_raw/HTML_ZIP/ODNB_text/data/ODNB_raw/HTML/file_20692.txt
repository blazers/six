<span class="headword">Oldisworth,  Giles</span>  (1619/20&#150;1678), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Coln Rogers, Gloucestershire, in 1619 or the first quarter of 1620, a younger son of Robert Oldisworth of that parish and his wife, Merial, daughter of Sir Nicholas Overbury. His mother was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20966/', "Sir Thomas Overbury")</script>, whose notorious murder in the Tower of London in 1613 hung over the family. Giles's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69871/', "Nicholas Oldisworth")</script>, wrote a manuscript life of Sir Thomas which, he recorded, &#145;I wrote from dictation, and read over to my old grandfather Sir Nicholas Overbury, on Thursday, 1 Oct. 1637&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 15476, fol. 1).<br>
<br>Oldisworth was educated at Westminster School, and must often have listened to the sermons of the dean of St Paul's, John Donne. Admitted as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 17 May 1639, he was elected to a scholarship there on 17 April 1640, and graduated BA in 1643. In 1644 he was deprived of his scholarship on account of his royalist sympathies, and proceeded to Oxford, where, by virtue of a letter written on 29 January 1646 on his behalf by the chancellor of the university, the marquess of Hertford, he was created MA on 20 July 1646. Oldisworth had just been presented by his grandfather Sir Nicholas Overbury to the living of Bourton on the Hill, Gloucestershire, where he succeeded his elder brother as rector.<br>
<br>Giles Oldisworth was able to retain his living at Bourton throughout the interregnum. He married Margaret Warren, who did not survive him, and they had at least five children. He was the owner of a copy of the 1639 edition of John Donne's <span class="italic">Poems by J.D. with Elegies on the Author's Death</span>. His annotations have helped to identify some of the elegists; they show that Oldisworth studied the work with &#145;scrupulous care&#146; and that he was &#145;in close touch with well-informed views upon literary and other topics of the day&#146;  (Sampson, 83&#150;4). Oldisworth was himself a published author. In 1663 he issued <span class="italic">The stone rolled away, and life more abundant: an apologie urging self-denyall, new-obedience, faith, and thankfulnesse</span>, prefaced with a laudatory epistle to the king, dated 5 November. This was reissued the following year with a new title, <span class="italic">The holy royalist, or, The secret discontents of church &amp; kingdom, reduced unto self-denial, moderation and thankfulnes</span>, and with a portrait of the king as frontispiece. In 1673 he made his own contribution to family piety by publishing an edition of Sir Thomas Overbury's poem, &#145;The Wife&#146;, as <span class="italic">The illustrious wife, viz that excellent poem, Sir Thomas Overburie's wife, illustrated by Giles Oldisworth, nephew to the same Sir T.O.</span> Oldisworth himself wrote, under the pseudonym of Sketlius, a manuscript poem entitled &#145;A Westminster Scholar, or, The Patterne of Pietie&#146;. It is a narrative, written in five books, in high-flown language, describing members of the families of Oldisworth and Overbury under fictitious names, with some explanatory notes in the margin.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1665 Oldisworth preached a sermon at the chapel of the Mercers' Company in London. Before its publication, as <span class="italic">The Race Set before Us</span>, the following year at Oxford, he had entered the employment of Herbert Croft, bishop of Hereford, signing the dedicatory epistle as &#145;Your lordship's most obliged servant and devoted chaplain&#146;, &#145;from my study 7 Nov 1665&#146;; a preface to Lady Croft in <span class="italic">The Father of the Faithfull</span> suggests that he may have retained that position in 1674. Giles Oldisworth died at Bourton on the Hill on 24 November 1678, and was buried in the chancel of the church on 27 November. By his will, dated the day before his death, Oldisworth divided his property equally among four children, of whom Giles (born in 1650 and by now a citizen of London) and Mary were of age; he appointed his brother William guardian to Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 10 April 1659) and Hester.<br>
