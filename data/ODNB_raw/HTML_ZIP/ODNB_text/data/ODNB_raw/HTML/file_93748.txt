<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pitt,  Joseph</span>  (1759&#150;1842), <span class="occ">property developer and politician</span>, was born in 1759 at Little Witcombe, a hamlet in Badgeworth, Gloucestershire, where he was baptized at the parish church on 24 June, the youngest of five sons of Joseph Pitt, a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Golding (or Godding). His father, whose farm lay on the main road from Cirencester to Gloucester, was from Brokenborough in north Wiltshire, and much of Pitt's life was played out along an axis connecting the two counties. Although in later life Pitt adopted the arms of the family of former prime minister William Pitt (and as an MP he attended memorial dinners of the Pitt Club), no connection between the two lines is known.<br>
<br>Pitt's early education is obscure, but by about 1780 he was an attorney or solicitor in Cirencester. John Campbell, later lord chancellor, recalled:<blockquote>he used to hold gentlemen's horses for a penny; when, appearing a sharp lad, an attorney took a fancy to him, and bred him to his own business. Pitt soon scraped together a little money by his practice in the law. (Hardcastle, 286)</blockquote>That &#145;little money&#146; must have been well-managed, for in 1790 Pitt and three partners set up a bank in Cirencester; with others, he set up a second bank in Cheltenham, with a branch at Burford, Oxfordshire. In a third partnership, he had a bank at Tetbury, Gloucestershire, with an agency at Dursley.<br>
<br>Pitt had meanwhile married three times. He married first, in 1786, Mary Robbins of Didmarton, a yeoman's daughter, with whom he had one son, Cornelius, who in 1831 became rector of Rendcomb, Gloucestershire, where Pitt had acquired the right of presentation in 1798. Mary died in 1788. He next married, in January 1790, Ann Daubeny, daughter of Andrew Daubeny of a Bristol family; a probable relative, James Daubeny, practised with Pitt as an attorney in Cirencester. She died in August 1792, after a miscarriage brought on by violent coughing caused by loose hairs from a toothbrush. His third wife was Ann Orlidge of Bristol, whom he married on 4 March 1794 and with whom he had four sons and two daughters; she died on 11 July 1819.<br>
<br>As Pitt prospered he bought land, and was able eventually to establish himself as a country gentleman. He bought his first estate at Minety, Wiltshire, in 1791, and soon sought to improve his income from it by enclosure. This was to prove a slow process, but may have provided the seed for more ambitious plans in Cheltenham, then flourishing as a spa after the landmark royal visit of 1788. As a solicitor, Pitt was involved in property transactions in Cheltenham, and would have been fully aware of the scope to make money in an expanding town. He had been buying small tracts of land himself from 1789. His first significant Cheltenham development, beginning in 1805 on a central site purchased in 1799, was Royal Crescent (a scaled-down echo of the Bath example), intended as first-class lodging houses. This was relatively small beer, and to gain bigger returns Pitt was content to play a long game. He backed Cheltenham's <span class="roman">Enclosure Act</span> of 1801, and by the time the awards were finalized in 1806, he was, with 235 acres, the largest single landholder. These holdings, mostly fields to the north of the town centre and now consolidated, allowed him to envisage a complete new estate, planned from scratch and with a new spa as its anchor attraction. Within the town, meanwhile, in 1809 Pitt and others promoted the construction of a residential terrace at Cambray, on a 21-year tontine scheme.<br>
<br>In 1807 Pitt had acquired an estate at Eastcourt, in the parish of Crudwell and near Minety. This became his home and country seat for the rest of his life; despite his extensive interests in Cheltenham, he never lived in the town. Through his office as bailiff and returning officer for Cirencester, Pitt nurtured an interest in politics. He bought the lordship of the manor of Cricklade in 1811, and was returned as tory MP for Cricklade in 1812; in the same year he sold his solicitor's practice. He served as MP for Cricklade in five parliaments, until retiring in 1831, and through purchase of patronages was also able to control the elections at Malmesbury, though he had less success at influencing the outcome at Wootton Bassett. He rarely spoke in the House of Commons, but was active on parliamentary committees, maintaining a residence nearby in Great George Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>While in the 1810s Pitt's attention was perhaps more on his parliamentary career, by 1820 the pace of growth and new building in Cheltenham (an aspect of a national economic boom) was not to be ignored, and in 1824 serious work on the creation of a new estate began. It was conceived as a new town, competing with the established spa attractions of Montpellier and Bayshill to the south of the centre. Pitt entrusted the general design to John Forbes, a locally based architect; it covered 100 acres, crossed by several miles of gravelled walks and rides, along which lots for between 500 and 600 houses were to be set out. Careful covenant stipulations ensured that those who bought lots could only erect to building lines, designs, and standards approved by Pitt. Perhaps following the London example of Pentonville (1770s), the name Pittville was quickly applied to the scheme, and was in general use by the time the foundation stone of the pump room was laid in May 1825.<br>
<br>His friend the Revd Francis Witts wrote in 1825 that Pitt was &#145;one of those fortunate members of the legal profession, whom great sagacity, lucky opportunity and the skill of seizing on favourable circumstances have elevated from a very humble to a very prosperous situation in life&#146;  (Witts, 42). Or so it seemed: almost immediately, the economy weakened, the housing market cooled, and take-up of the Pittville lots became sluggish. Pitt notably failed to attend the grand opening of the pump room in 1830, though was once again taking a personal interest in the development in 1832&#150;3, when his new architect, Robert Stokes, proposed and executed enhancements to the entrance routes to Pittville. While all the houses actually built were fully in line with Pitt's vision, sales of lots did not quicken sufficiently, and Pitt's mortgage debt on the scheme was considerable, exacerbated by his practice of giving builders long loans. His steady disposal or mortgaging of other properties in both counties from 1820 to 1840 failed to offset his net debts, and income consistently fell below outgoings.<br>
<br>Pitt died on 9 February 1842, at Eastcourt, aged eighty-three. He was buried at Crudwell, his monument noting his record as high steward of Malmesbury, as MP for Cricklade, and as magistrate both in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, but silent as to Pittville and Cheltenham. His will (drafted 1837) showed he felt he had already made adequate provision for his children; his residual estate went to his son Joseph (1796&#150;1869; also a solicitor), who had the unenviable and protracted task of winding up his affairs. Pitt's debts totalled &pound;154,503, more than a third of it owed to Joseph Randolph Mullings, his long-standing solicitor in Cirencester. After two auctions of building lots in the 1840s, most of the Pittville estate passed into the hands of the County of Gloucester Bank (descendant of Pitt's own Cheltenham Bank), which managed it until its purchase by Cheltenham corporation in 1890. In 1894 the open spaces were re-designated Pittville Park, with the pump room its centrepiece attraction.<br>
<br>Even though Pitt may have lived to regret his financial misjudgement over Pittville, the design standards he insisted on for the estate have ensured that two centuries later, his legacy is not only still recognizable but widely appreciated by residents and visitors. His later indebtedness should not overshadow his contemporary reputation as a generous and public-spirited man; besides investing in major buildings such as the pump room, he also for example contributed significantly to flood relief works after the inundation at Boston, Lincolnshire, in 1810.<br>
