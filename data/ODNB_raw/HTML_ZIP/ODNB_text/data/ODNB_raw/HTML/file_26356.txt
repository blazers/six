<span class="headword">Steevens,  George Warrington</span>  (1869&#150;1900), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, son of James Steevens and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright, was born at 40 Rowland Grove, Wells Road, Sydenham, Kent, on 10 December 1869. His father was a bank clerk and his family were Plymouth Brethren. He grew up in Clapham, attended a private school, and in 1882 won a scholarship to the City of London School, where he was outstandingly successful. He was captain of the school in 1887&#150;8, and in 1887 won a classical scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied from 1888 to 1892. In 1889, through a school friend at Cambridge, he became a friend of Oscar Browning, fellow of King's College. Browning, who knew many young men, wrote that Steevens was &#145;one of the most brilliant young men I ever knew&#146;  (Browning, 327) and tried to help his career. By early 1890 Steevens had broken with his family's Brethrenism, and he described himself as &#145;a discontented atheist&#146;  (Steevens to Browning; Oscar Browning MSS).<br>
<br>At Oxford, Steevens's success was such that he was called &#145;the Balliol prodigy&#146;: firsts in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> and, at the same time, a London BA with &#145;highest honours&#146;, then in 1893 a fellowship at Pembroke College. At school and Oxford he was radical in politics. When an undergraduate he visited Whitechapel and criticized slum landlords, and at Pembroke he was, according to W. E. Henley, &#145;rather gloomy and socialistic&#146;  (Henley, xiv). In 1892 he helped Browning's Gladstonian election campaign in East Worcestershire, against the Chamberlain interest.<br>
<br>Befriended by W. E. Henley, Steevens wrote for the <span class="italic">National Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">New Review</span>. In 1893 he was employed by Henry Cust, editor of the Conservative <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, for which he wrote &#145;the funny paragraphs&#146; and articles on foreign policy. He also contributed to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">M'Clure's</span>, and <span class="italic">Harper's</span>. His political beliefs apparently shifted to the right, and became imperialist and concerned with defence. In 1895 Cust quarrelled with the paper's American owner, W. W. Astor, and resigned, as did Steevens.<br>
<br>On 25 August 1894 Steevens married the much older Christina Adelaide Ethel Athanasia (1838&#150;1911), daughter of Duncan Stewart and widow of James Alexander Rogerson of Wamphray, Scotland, whom she had married in 1862. She had been involved in the Crawford divorce case which ruined Sir Charles Dilke's political career, and was a contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. She was, according to Grant Richards, &#145;a forceful lady&#146; who &#145;possessed still a fascination that made most young men her slaves&#146;  (Richards, 212&#150;13). Eccentric and allegedly mendacious, she entertained lavishly with jugs of iced champagne at their residence, Merton Abbey, and tried to boost Steevens's career. They had no children, and she survived him.<br>
<br>In 1896 Steevens published <span class="italic">Naval Policy</span>, a competent restatement of navalist orthodoxy warning of British naval vulnerability. In the same year he joined Alfred Harmsworth's new <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Exceptionally successful in vivid descriptive writing, he worked for it for the rest of his life and became its star reporter. In 1896 he reported the United States presidential election; in 1897 the Graeco-Turkish War&#151;his first experience as a war correspondent; in 1897&#150;8 Egypt; in 1898 the Sudan War and India, and in 1899 the retrial of Dreyfus at Rennes. From his reports he compiled books, of which the most successful was <span class="italic">With Kitchener to Khartum</span> (1898). His reporting and books made him famous. He was a favourite of Harmsworth: &#145;the schoolboy in Alfred went out to meet the schoolboy in Steevens&#146;  (H. H. Fyfe, <span class="italic">Northcliffe: an Intimate Biography</span>, 1930, 90). He continued to contribute to <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> and other journals: two key statements were his <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> pieces &#145;The new humanitarianism&#146; (1898) and &#145;From the new Gibbon&#146; (1899).<br>
<br>In 1899 Steevens was sent to South Africa, arriving in October, before the war began. He accompanied Sir George White's army in Natal, reported the battles of Elandslaagte and Nicholson's Nek, and was besieged in Ladysmith. He sent his reports through the Boer lines by native runner, and edited and contributed to the <span class="italic">Ladysmith Lyre</span>, a spoof newspaper. He died, aged thirty, of typhoid on 15 January 1900, and was buried in Ladysmith cemetery. His South African reports were published posthumously in the book <span class="italic">From Capetown to Ladysmith</span> (1900).<br>
<br>Steevens was &#145;a thin, pale man in glasses&#146;  (Lionel James, <span class="italic">High Pressure</span>, 1932, 62), charming and witty company with &#145;a wayward brilliance and amusing tendency to paradox&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and also brave. He was a perceptive and vivid writer with a distinctive style, but much of what he wrote was hurried journalism: insufficiently researched, impressionistic, dogmatic, and sometimes biased. Although after his death there was public controversy over what he himself had believed, his published message was proud patriotism, imperialism, navalism, bellicism, social Darwinism, and anti-decadence. Some criticized him: his schoolfriend Anton Bertram, possibly jealous, wrote in 1898 that &#145;he has made himself the hero of the British clerk &amp; shopkeeper &hellip; his most prominent qualities seem to me those of the jingo, the cynic, &amp; the philistine&#146;  (Bertram to Browning, 26 Dec 1898; Oscar Browning MSS), yet this was exceptional. Praised in his lifetime, at his death Steevens was eulogized. Sidney Lee expressed the general opinion when he wrote that &#145;his premature death prevented the fulfilment of his high literary promise&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Yet he had already achieved much. A leading war correspondent, he was also among the most influential propagandists of late Victorian imperialism.<br>
