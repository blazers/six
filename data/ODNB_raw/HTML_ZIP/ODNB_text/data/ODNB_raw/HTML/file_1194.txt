<span class="headword">Balfour,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1555, <em>d.</em> in or after 1621), <span class="occ">philosopher and classical scholar</span>, was born at Tarrie in Forfarshire; that he matriculated at St Andrews University in 1571 suggests a date of birth about 1555. After graduating he taught at St Andrews, but subsequently travelled to France to continue his studies, as many Scots did in the sixteenth century. Having spent some time in Paris, where he may have taught as well as studied, he moved to Bordeaux, probably before 1580, to teach at that city's major educational institution, the Coll&egrave;ge de Guyenne. He remained there for the rest of his life, initially holding the chair of philosophy and then one in mathematics, which had been specially endowed for him by the noted mathematician and student of hermeticism Fran&ccedil;ois Foix de la Candale. Balfour became principal of the Coll&egrave;ge de Guyenne in 1602 and held this position until 1621. It is not known when he died.<br>
<br>As a teacher Balfour offered courses covering most of Aristotelian philosophy, as well as more general surveys of logic, ethics, and astronomy. His published commentaries on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Organon</span> (2 vols., 1618&#150;20) and his edition of Cleomedes' astronomical treatise, <span class="italic">De motu circulari corporum caelestium</span> (1605), were undoubtedly derived from his teaching. His Aristotelian commentaries are notable for the rhetorical flair of their literary style and also for their energetic defence of moral philosophy as a guide to a useful and virtuous life. His edition of Cleomedes won the approval of Isaac Casaubon and Joseph Scaliger, and was so far respected by Cleomedes' next editor in 1820 that he reproduced its commentary. The prefaces to these works reveal Balfour's wide range of contacts among contemporary scholars in southern France, especially Toulouse, and his high standing in the Bordeaux community. They show vast erudition, as well as a strong conservatism, particularly in a predictable emphasis on Copernican cosmology as merely hypothetical. His Catholicism is also reflected in his edition of works by Gelasius and Theodoret relating to the early fourth-century Council of Nicaea (1599). Balfour was a minor figure, significant primarily as a representative of the long-standing cultural affinity between Scotland and France, one which persevered in spite of the divisions created by the Reformation. Within this tradition he managed to be an effective scholar, teacher, and university administrator.<br>
<br>Balfour's general course on philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy is preserved in manuscript as Bordeaux, Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, MS 1558. There also survive letters which he wrote to F&eacute;d&eacute;ric Morel, professor of Latin at the Coll&egrave;ge Royal at Paris (Leiden, Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit, MS 758 C 28).<br>
