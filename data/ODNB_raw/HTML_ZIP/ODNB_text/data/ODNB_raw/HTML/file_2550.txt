<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackwood,  William</span>  (1776&#150;1834), <span class="occ">publisher and founder of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 20 November 1776, the second son of Alexander Blackwood (1736&#150;1802), descended from a family of silk mercers, and Janet Drysdale. On finishing his formal education at the age of fourteen, Blackwood entered into a six-year apprenticeship with the Edinburgh booksellers Bell and Bradfute, located in Parliament Square. Through Mrs Bradfute, wife of one of the firm's partners, William Blackwood met his future wife, Janet Steuart (1779&#150;1849). He completed his apprenticeship in 1796, and subsequently undertook further training in other areas of the publishing trade, superintending the Glasgow branch of the Edinburgh publishers Mundell &amp; Co. for a year, serving as a partner with the antiquarian bookseller and auctioneer Robert Ross for another, and working for two years in London in the antiquarian department of the booksellers Cuthill. In 1804 Blackwood opened a shop at 64 South Bridge, Edinburgh, specializing in acquiring and selling rare books. The business was a success, and in October 1805 he married Janet Steuart; in 1806 they moved to Salisbury Road, where their nine children, seven boys and two girls, were born and raised.<br>
<br>By 1810 Blackwood had begun experimenting in publishing, producing historical works and publishing a biography of John Knox. Blackwood's breakthrough occurred in 1811, when he was appointed the Edinburgh agent for the publisher John Murray, becoming an important link in the distribution of the latest works from London. Blackwood consolidated his position in the trade by becoming the agent in March 1813 for James and John Ballantyne, printers of Walter Scott's novels. This arrangement paved the way in 1816 for Blackwood and John Murray to co-publish Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Tales of my Landlord</span>, comprising the novels <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span> and <span class="italic">Black Dwarf</span>. It is said that Scott's response to Blackwood's suggestions for improvements to <span class="italic">Black Dwarf</span>, made during production and in consultation with William Gifford, editor of Murray's <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, was an acerbic comment that &#145;I belong to the Death-Head Hussars who neither give nor receive criticism&#146;. Scott's publishing connection with Blackwood was terminated shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>In 1816 Blackwood moved his firm to the more spacious New Town premises of 17 Princes Street. A second and final move was made to 45 George Street in 1830. By 1817 Blackwood had begun concentrating his business in publishing, and in April of that year he launched the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</span> under the joint editorship of James Cleghorn and Thomas Pringle. Originally envisaged as a &#145;more nimble, more frequent, more familiar&#146; tory alternative to the whig-orientated quarterly <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, the first six issues failed to live up to the publisher's vision. After firing Pringle and Cleghorn, Blackwood took editorial control and relaunched the journal in October 1817 as <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, with new contributors and editorial input from members of his literary coterie, who included John Gibson Lockhart, John Wilson (Christopher North), and James Hogg. The first issue, which included a new blend of literary and political articles and fiction, anonymous attacks on Leigh Hunt, the &#145;cockney school&#146; of poetry, and, in the mock biblical &#145;Chaldee manuscript&#146;, a ferociously satirical attack on Edinburgh society, set the tone for future issues. Those who smarted most under the attacks were quick to retaliate, bringing lawsuits and libel actions against the magazine, which Blackwood endured on behalf of his editorial team, some of whom fled Edinburgh for the safety of the Lake District until the furore died down. Frightened by the storm caused by this upstart journal, Baldwin, Cradock &amp; Co. (Blackwood's London agents), and Oliver and Boyd (Blackwood's printers), severed their connections with the firm. Leigh Hunt demanded the identity of &#145;Z&#146;, the anonymous author of the attack on him, and for months pamphlet wars raged between pro- and anti-Blackwood camps. Literary hostilities reached a climax in 1821, when John Gibson Lockhart challenged John Scott, rival editor of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, to a duel. Lockhart's second, G. H. Christie, faced Scott instead, mortally wounding him with his second shot. Future Blackwoodians were confined by Blackwood to the printed page for their literary quarrels.<br>
<br>Bringing home the first number of his new magazine, Blackwood is said to have presented it to his wife with the words, &#145;There's ma Maga-zine&#146;. In affectionate parody, the journal became known to future generations of editors, contributors, and readers as &#145;Maga&#146;. Maga's rising reputation brought competition from London&#151;the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, for example, was begun in 1820 specifically in response to the journal. Blackwood, however, consolidated his initial success by attracting a core of well-placed writers to work for him, including the Irishmen William Maginn and Samuel Ferguson, John Galt, David M. Moir (Delta), and Thomas De Quincey. The magazine also featured occasional reviews by Walter Scott, fiction by Samuel Warren and Susan Ferrier, and work by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1822 the magazine began a regular feature, <span class="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</span>, an extremely popular, imaginative series of collaborative, colloquial, and discursive essays combining politics and literary and cultural criticism, written collaboratively by several Blackwood contributors, chief among them being John Wilson, James Hogg, and Robert Sym. After 1825 John Wilson became the main writer of the series, which ran until 1835.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1820s and early 1830s Blackwood turned his firm, William Blackwood &amp; Sons, into the leading Scottish publisher of the period, printing seminal works of fiction, history, and biography. A technique pioneered by Blackwood was the publishing in book form of fiction first serialized in the magazine, predating Charles Dickens's use of such marketing strategies by several years. Works featured in this way included Susan Ferrier's <span class="italic">Marriage</span> (1818) and <span class="italic">Inheritance</span> (1824), John Galt's <span class="italic">The Ayrshire Legatees</span> (1820&#150;21) and <span class="italic">Annals of the Parish</span> (1821), and David M. Moir's <span class="italic">The Autobiography of Mansie Wauch</span> (1824&#150;8). Other important Blackwood publications included John Gibson Lockhart's <span class="italic">Peter's Letters to his Kinfolk</span> (1819) and Thomas Hamilton's <span class="italic">Annals of the Peninsular War</span> (1829), as well as various learned journals and legal, medical, and theological texts. Blackwood also took on civic responsibilities, becoming a major figure in Edinburgh tory politics as an active member of the Edinburgh town council. He was made a bailie of the city by the council in 1820, and in 1828 was elected commissioner of police, a post he was to discharge with great vigour until shortly before his death at Salisbury Road, Edinburgh, on 16 September 1834. He was buried in the Calton cemetery in Edinburgh. The editorship of the magazine was taken over in 1845 by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2549/', "John Blackwood")</script>, Blackwood's sixth son. The <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38928/', "William Blackwood (1836&#150;1912)")</script> who was editor from 1879 was his grandson.<br>
