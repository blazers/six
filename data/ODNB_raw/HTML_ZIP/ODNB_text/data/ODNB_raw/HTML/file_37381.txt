<span class="headword">Eady,  Eric Thomas</span>  (1915&#150;1966), <span class="occ">meteorologist</span>, was born on 5 September 1915 at 51 Devonshire Road, Ealing, London, the elder child and only son of Thomas Christopher Eady, civil servant with the Post Office, and his wife, Charlotte Anderton. He was educated at Ealing county grammar school, where he was awarded a state scholarship and a minor open scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated as a senior optime in part two of the mathematical tripos in 1935. After short periods as a lecturer in mathematics at King Alfred's Teacher Training College in Winchester and as a technical researcher in aircraft vibration for De Havilland, he joined the Meteorological Office as a technical officer in 1938, where he served as a weather forecaster in fighter and reconnaissance groups. Following commission as flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve he specialized in upper-air analysis and forecasting for bomber groups. His last posting was to Lagos, Nigeria, before he was demobilized in February 1946.<br>
<br>Eady had spent much of his spare time working on a theory for the formation of atmospheric depressions and decided to devote all his time to it; he resigned from the Meteorological Office to become a graduate student at Imperial College. He was not accepted into the department of meteorology but registered as a student in the department of mathematics, where he wrote a doctoral thesis, &#145;The theory of development in dynamical meteorology&#146;.<br>
<br>The novelty and importance of his work were appreciated even before he was awarded the PhD degree in 1948. He proceeded rapidly from research student to lecturer and then to reader in dynamical climatology (in the department of meteorology) by 1949. In that year he married Marjorie, daughter of Edgar Currie, formerly a warehouse foreman for a removals firm, but incapacitated during the First World War. There were no children.<br>
<br>Eady was invited to discuss his work at leading meteorological institutes round the world. Since then the &#145;Eady problem&#146; has become a classical reference in the subject&#151;J. G. Charney, the leading American worker in the same field, acknowledged that Eady's treatment was exceptional, being more comprehensible and more physically realistic than his own seminal contribution. However, Eady published little of his work, even though he wrote, as he spoke, fluently and well (talking with him was one of the pleasures of life). He continually broadened his professional interests to include the ocean, the earth's core, motions in the atmospheres of planets, the theory of fluids, biophysics, and biochemistry. Eventually he became depressed by the sheer difficulty of his subject, by the realization that he was not, as he put it, going to be able to build a cathedral. He isolated himself more and more from his friends and colleagues; he died, after an overdose of painkillers, at the Royal County Hospital, Guildford, on 26 March 1966.<br>
