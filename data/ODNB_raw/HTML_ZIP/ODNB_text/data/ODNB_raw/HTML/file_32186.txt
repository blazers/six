<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burnet,  John</span>  (1863&#150;1928), <span class="occ">Greek scholar</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 9 December 1863, the eldest child of John Burnet, advocate, and his wife, Jessie, daughter of Dr James Cleghorn Kay RN. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and was also for a few months at a school near Geneva. In October 1880 he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, where he pursued the study of Latin and Greek, and began that of Sanskrit. He won there the Vans Dunlop scholarship in classics, and a little later the first open classical scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford. After paying a short visit to Paris, where he attended lectures at the Sorbonne and the Coll&egrave;ge de France, Burnet went into residence at Oxford in October 1883. There, besides being placed in the first class in classical moderations (1884) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1887), he won the Taylorian scholarship in French (1885) and was <i>proxime accessit</i> for the Boden scholarship in Sanskrit. While he was an undergraduate he preferred to follow his own lines of study, even at the risk of leaving considerable gaps in the conventional programme of preparation for the final examinations. Like many of his contemporaries he was specially influenced by Richard Lewis Nettleship, but he showed no particular interest in philosophy.<br>
<br>Burnet's first attempt to win a fellowship was not successful, and he left Oxford in 1887 in order to become private assistant to Lewis Campbell, professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews. With his work there under Campbell began his lifelong concern with the philosophy of Plato. Campbell was a pioneer in the attempt to determine, largely upon &#145;stylometric&#146; considerations, the chronological order of the Platonic dialogues, and Burnet became convinced not only of the rightness of Campbell's methods, but of the correctness in the main of the results attained by them. After five months at St Andrews he made a brief trial of teaching at Harrow School (1888), but did not find the work congenial. Fortunately, he was soon after elected to a prize fellowship at Merton College, Oxford, and entered into residence there in 1889. The leisure which the position gave him was employed in increasing his knowledge of Aristotle, partly under the guidance of Ingram Bywater, and in planning a commentary on the <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span>, which he did not complete until considerably later (1899).<br>
<br>After some temporary teaching posts at the universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews in 1890 and 1891, Burnet was elected professor of Greek at the latter university in 1891 upon the resignation of Campbell, and occupied the chair there until he resigned it in 1926. He married in 1894 Mary, daughter of John Farmer, organist at Harrow and at Balliol College; they had one daughter. He lived and worked at St Andrews until his death. From the time of a grave illness in 1923 his health grew worse in spite of occasional rallies. In 1926 he was able to fulfil an engagement to deliver the Sather lectures in classical literature in the University of California (published in 1928 under the title <span class="italic">Platonism</span>); but the summer heat of Chicago, where he also lectured, exhausted his strength, and on his return to St Andrews he was unable to continue his work as professor. He died at St Andrews on 26 May 1928; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>During the whole tenure of his chair Burnet proved himself an exceptionally inspiring and successful teacher by his striking personality and his command of his whole subject, winning the affectionate admiration of generations of his students. He took a large part in the work of university administration. He had a wide knowledge of the systems of higher education in other countries, and held clear and firm views upon the proper methods of its organization. He occupied several important posts upon educational committees and boards, and was active in promoting the popularization of humanistic culture in Scotland through the Classical Association of Scotland, which he helped to found. His services to education were not diminished by his occasional failures to secure the adoption of some of the policies which he advocated.<br>
<br>To the world of scholarship in the narrower sense Burnet's greatest contribution was his critical edition, in the <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span> series, of the whole text of the works of Plato (1900&#150;08; rev. 1905&#150;13); this superseded all previous editions. It was based on a wide foundation of the manuscript evidence, and guided by a close knowledge of Platonic vocabulary, idiom, and style. Burnet's judgements on disputed points were sober and sane, and the text was fairly conservative. More detailed work on the textual transmission has, however, revealed some shortcomings in the edition, not all of which can legitimately be counted against him. His commentaries on the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Euthyphro</span>, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, and <span class="italic">Crito</span> (1924) were models of conciseness and lucidity, full of original observations upon Platonic usages. He designed a new <span class="italic">Lexicon Platonicum</span>, but although he laboured at it, did not proceed far in its construction. His commentary on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span> contained much that was fresh and enlightening, but his work on Aristotle, of whose philosophy he never acquired the same wide and intimate knowledge as he had of Plato's, perhaps scarcely reaches the same level as his work on Plato.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Early Greek Philosophy</span> (1892; rev. edn, 1908; 4th edn, 1945) Burnet did not carry his detailed study down beyond Aristotle, and indeed he gave no systematic account of the philosophy of Aristotle. On the other hand, he several times revised and restated his views on the pre-Socratics, withdrawing some of his more venturesome speculations, but repeating his general results in a form which won the acceptance of most scholars. In his account of these thinkers he keeps steadily in view and vividly expresses the historic background of their lives and thoughts. For the English reader he superseded previous accounts, and effectively removed the misleading veil which had been cast over them by Hegel and the Hegelians. He utilized the contributions to this work of correction and interpretation made by Tannery, Baeumker, and Diels, but his agreement with them is the result of his own independent investigation of the evidence.<br>
<br>Burnet's <span class="italic">Greek Philosophy: Part I, Thales to Plato</span> (1914) adds to a summary statement of his views on these early cosmological thinkers an equally original account of the sophists, Socrates, and Democritus. But its most valuable part is its masterly account of the life, character, and whole philosophy of Plato. It is brilliantly written, and was in its day incomparably the best treatment in English of its subject. Burnet accepts as trustworthy evidence for the career and thought of Plato most of the letters, and assumes as now ascertained facts the dates of composition of most of the dialogues. In his account of the development of Plato's thought he draws a firm line between a Socratic period and a later period in which Plato is expounding his own philosophy; and he attributes to Plato a consciousness and acknowledgement of his passage from discipleship to independence. But his view of the historical Socrates as the source of fundamental Platonic doctrines concerning &#145;separate forms&#146; and &#145;recollection&#146; has been challenged. He regards Plato as in his later works criticizing his master's teaching on physics, theory of knowledge, metaphysics, and politics.<br>
<br>Burnet's title to the fame which his work enjoys both at home and abroad rests securely upon his inspiring force as a teacher, upon his edition of the text of Plato, upon his classic and convincing account of the beginnings of Greek science and philosophy, upon his minute acquaintance with and vivid sense of the niceties of Platonic vocabulary and idiom, upon his long and deeply meditated presentation of the philosophy of Plato, whom he admired and loved above all writers and thinkers, and upon the freshness of view and the distinction of style which mark all his writings.<br>
