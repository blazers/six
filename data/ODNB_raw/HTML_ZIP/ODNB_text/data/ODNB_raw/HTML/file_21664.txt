<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peabody,  George</span>  (1795&#150;1869), <span class="occ">merchant banker and philanthropist</span>, was born on 18 February 1795 in South Danvers (later Peabody), Massachusetts, USA, the third child in a family of four sons and four daughters.<h2>
<a name="Originsandearlylife"></a>Origins and early life</h2>Thomas Peabody, George's father, was descended from a Leicestershire man, Francis Peboddy, a dissenter who had emigrated to Massachusetts on the sailing ship <i>Planter</i> in 1635. His mother, Judith Dodge, was descended from the Spofford family, a dissenting family from Yorkshire, who had likewise emigrated to Massachusetts in the mid-seventeenth century. Thomas Peabody was a casual leather-worker and small-scale farmer who died in 1811, and both before and after his death the family was poor. Peabody's village schooling was limited and irregular, and came to an end at the age of eleven, when he was apprenticed to John Proctor, the owner of a country general store in Danvers. It was from this man that Peabody learned to keep accounts in a clear handwriting and to organize and discipline his daily activities. Over the next several years he changed his occupation several times: he worked on his grandfather's farm in Thetford, Vermont; he rode on horseback through Virginia, hawking goods; he clerked in the store owned by his elder brother David in Newburyport, Massachusetts; and he worked with his uncle, John Peabody, in the District of Columbia.<br>
<br>Here in 1814 Peabody's luck changed. He impressed a successful merchant of dry goods in Georgetown, Elisha Riggs, and the two of them opened a wholesale warehouse for dry goods, Riggs supplying the money. The next year the partnership of Riggs, Peabody &amp; Co. was formed in Baltimore, specializing in importing dry goods from Britain; in 1822 branches were opened in New York and Philadelphia; and in 1829, with Riggs's retirement, the firm became Peabody, Riggs &amp; Co., with Peabody as senior partner. In 1827 Peabody had made his first business trip to Britain: ten years later, after several such visits, he settled permanently in England.<h2>
<a name="Merchantandmerchantbanker"></a>Merchant and merchant banker</h2>In August 1838 Peabody bought a supply of quill pens and ledgers and opened a counting-house. He had survived the panic of 1837, responding to the early signs of trouble by contracting operations and concentrating on collecting debts, and helping other firms who were in difficulties. By now a man of substance, with capital of over $300,000 (&pound;70,000), he could employ others to purchase the goods and sell them in the United States. Peabody was able to concentrate on the financial side of the firm, and during the period 1837&#150;45 gradually turned himself into a merchant banker. He continued to deal in dry goods, in corn for Ireland, in rails for the USA, and in trade with China, but at the same time he increasingly spent his time financing others' foreign trade and dealt especially in American securities, for which he seems to have been the major London specialist. In short, he followed the classic development of a merchant banker in Britain: he began as a merchant, financed his own and then others' trade, and eventually gave up trade in commodities to concentrate on banking and on securities.<br>
<br>By the late 1840s Peabody had decided that he wanted to build up his firm as the leading American house in London&#151;the centre of the American trade and for Americans in that trade. He needed correspondents in America, firms with whom he could maintain close connections as sources both of information and business; new types of business were required, and the support of a partner was essential. Building up a network of correspondents, Peabody subsequently moved into railway financing and the export of rails to America, and in 1854 he took a new partner, the American J. S. Morgan, with whose help he would achieve his ambition. Morgan thus joined the premier American house in London, though not yet the premier house in the American trade, a position contested by Baring Brothers and Brown, Shipley &amp; Co. Arranged in an American manner, with current American newspapers laid out on the table, the offices were intended to be a centre for Peabody's American friends while they were visiting England. Peabody was said to entertain every American who arrived at his office, supplying a letter of credit and introducing him around London, and perhaps providing a box at the opera, with a corsage for his wife; in July 1855 he remarked that he had entertained eighty Americans for dinner and thirty-five at the opera within a week.<br>
<br>Peabody also provided rather more lavish celebrations, and in the 1850s he became known for sumptuous Anglo-American dinners in honour of American diplomats and other notables. During the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in 1851, for which the US congress had refused to support the American section, the British press criticized the American exhibits; Peabody advanced &pound;3000 to the embarrassed exhibitors to provide for arranging and decorating the section. He also decided that a bold gesture was necessary, and he gave the first of a regular series of Fourth of July dinners: the duke of Wellington was the guest of honour. Where the duke led others followed, and these dinners were a highly publicized feature of London political life for several years.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Peabody and Morgan began soliciting business belonging to other firms by charging lower commission, a very un-English activity. This substantially increased business, but the outcome was nearly disastrous, as the company was caught out by the panic of 1857: most of its American correspondent houses contracted, and in some cases failed, owing Peabody substantial sums. Peabody had to ask the Bank of England for a loan of &pound;800,000; the bank would accept American securities as collateral only if guaranteed by residents in England. During the week it took to find these guarantors, rivals tried to force the firm out of business and Peabody &#145;dared them to cause his failure&#146;  (Parker, 95); but far from crashing, the firm emerged from the crisis with its credit intact.<br>
<br>This favourable outcome was the signal for Peabody to withdraw from active business. He was now sixty-three, tired, and ill, troubled by gout and rheumatism, and he felt time was running out: he was increasingly preoccupied with the dispersal of his fortune. Although he had never married, Peabody had been engaged for some months in 1838 to a young American woman twenty-four years his junior, Esther Elizabeth Hoppin. He had no direct acknowledged heirs, though he had had a mistress in Brighton who had borne him a daughter, to whom he was very generous during his lifetime&#151;he would regularly withdraw some of his own personal securities, as much as &pound;2000 at a time, to be realized and sent to her. However, he left them nothing in his will. Instead, he devoted the bulk of his fortune to the public good.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropy"></a>Philanthropy</h2>Peabody's philanthropies were divided between America and England. Much of his work in America was devoted to the support of education at many levels. On his visit to the USA in 1852 he gave $30,000 to his home town to found an educational institute, and on his visit in 1857 he founded the Peabody Institute in Baltimore with a gift of $300,000; both sums were later increased. The Baltimore Institute was to provide a library, a gallery of art, an academy of music, and prizes to encourage private and public school pupils. At the same time he gave $1200 annually for gold medals to female high-school graduates in Baltimore, to encourage support for the education of women. On his visit in 1866 he gave Harvard $150,000 to found an institute of archaeology (later the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology), and he presented Yale with a similar amount towards the teaching of physical science (used to found the Peabody Museum of Natural History). Between 1866 and 1869&#151;after the civil war&#151;he gave $2,000,000 to the Peabody Fund for Southern Education, set up in the first instance to provide for the education of newly emancipated slaves.<br>
<br>In Britain Peabody's major philanthropy was centred on housing. He wanted to leave London some token of his affection for the city. He thought first of an elaborate system of drinking fountains; then he considered helping Lord Shaftesbury's &#145;ragged schools&#146; for the children of the very poor. In the end, Shaftesbury convinced Peabody that it was more important to provide better housing conditions for the working classes, and in March 1859 Peabody decided that his gift would be a number of model dwellings. By means of the Peabody Donation Fund he gave &pound;500,000 towards building houses to be inhabited by poor Londoners who had good moral characters and were good members of society. The first block was opened in Spitalfields in 1864, and it was soon followed by buildings in Chelsea, Bermondsey, Islington, and Shadwell; by 1882 the fund owned 3500 dwellings and housed more than 14,600 people, and by 1939 there were more than 8000 dwellings. In 1962 the queen mother unveiled a plaque to Peabody at another new Peabody estate in Blackfriars. Peabody was made a freeman of the City of London, the first American to receive this honour, though he turned down the offer of a barony from Queen Victoria. In 1867 the US congress conferred a gold medal on him. Popular subscription raised the funds in England to provide the statue of Peabody in the royal exchange, which was unveiled by the prince of Wales in 1869.<br>
<br>In 1864 Peabody withdrew entirely from George Peabody &amp; Co., taking much of his capital with him (his fortune amounted to something over $10 million&#151;more than &pound;2 million). J. S. Morgan succeeded to the senior partnership and the name of the firm was changed to J. S. Morgan &amp; Co.; in 1910 it became Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandfinalyears"></a>Personality and final years</h2>Peabody was an imposing man. He stood 6 feet 1 inch tall, was broad-shouldered, with a round face and large nose, and had blue eyes and very dark brown hair, which by his early forties he was dyeing with &#145;African balm&#146;. He always liked very good clothes, and when money was no object never economized on quality. Jovial with his friends, he was formal and restrained with many members of his family, his feelings of responsibility sometimes overcoming his feelings of affection&#151;not surprisingly, when several of his relatives were distinctly feckless.<br>
<br>The career of George Peabody is an exemplification of much that the nineteenth century found admirable. Beginning his working life honest but poor, Peabody always worked hard&#151;there are hints throughout his career of long hours and endless days without breaks&#151;and he did not spurn &#145;twopenny&#146; business. He was always willing to take a risk, but by and large they were well-judged risks. Another element in his success was his knack of making useful friends, who tended to be wealthy and influential businessmen. His personal traits encouraged trust: he was personally austere while publicly generous. Although he had attended a Congregational church in his youth, he was not ostentatiously religious. Rather, he carried out the puritan doctrine of the stewardship of riches: it has been estimated that he gave away more than $8,600,000. He ended his life wealthy and respected.<br>
<br>Peabody died on 4 November 1869 at the house of his friend Sir Curtis Miranda Lampson, at 80 Eaton Square, London. His funeral was held in Westminster Abbey, and Queen Victoria and the prime minister, W. E. Gladstone, jointly requested the Royal Navy to provide HMS <i>Monarch</i>, the navy's newest ironclad, to take Peabody's body back home; on the orders of President U. S. Grant, it was escorted by the USS <i>Plymouth</i>. The American authorities received the body at Portland, Maine, and there were elaborate services there and in Peabody (as South Danvers had been renamed in 1868). The family tomb, built by Peabody for his parents and other members of his family, was situated in a thick walnut grove in Harmony Rest cemetery on the boundary between Peabody and Salem, Massachusetts. He was finally laid to rest there on 8 February 1870.<br>
