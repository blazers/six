<span class="headword">Marche,  Jean  de la</span>  (1585&#150;1651), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born on 6 August 1585, the elder son of Hellier de la Marche (<i>c</i>.1558&#150;1643) of St Peter Port, Guernsey, and his wife, Michelle, daughter of Thomas Verin. Thomas Cartwright, minister at Castle Cornet (1595&#150;1601), may have been an early influence. He attended the universities of Cambridge, from 1604 to <i>c</i>.1608, and Saumur, from <i>c</i>.1608 to 1610, graduating MA on 10 September 1610. He was ordained on 6 August 1613 and became minister in Guernsey of both St Andrew and La For&ecirc;t in the following month, of Castle Cornet from 23 May 1623, and of St Peter Port from 15 February 1625.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1616 de la Marche married Esther De Beauvoir, heir to La Ville au Roi, St Peter Port. Of their children, Bertranne and Thomas died in 1622, and Charles (1618&#150;1695), minister of the Castel parish, Guernsey, until 1662, was chaplain to Whitlocke's Swedish embassy in 1653. Jean junior was probably another son, about whom little is known, save his becoming Castle Cornet's gaoler in 1660, suggesting royalist sympathies and familial estrangement.<br>
<br>De la Marche was active in Guernsey's parliament, the <i>&eacute;tats</i> or states, in which the clergy sat <i>ex officio</i>. In November 1616 James I personally assured him of the continuation of Guernsey's presbyterian regime. From 1626 de la Marche challenged the secular power's claims to certain tithes. Consequently accused of treason and false doctrine, he was imprisoned in Castle Cornet for seven months in 1633. After appealing to the privy council without result he returned in July 1634 and was ejected from the living of St Peter Port, reassuming the rectorship of St Andrew in August.<br>
<br>Following their release from Channel Island prisons, Henry Burton and William Prynne banqueted at de la Marche's home on 19 November 1640. In March 1641 de la Marche was sent to draw parliament's attention to Guernsey church affairs, presumably in support of a national presbyterian settlement. His <span class="italic">Complaint of the False Prophets Mariners</span> was presented to the Commons on 28 July 1641, at the height of the root and branch debates. Dedicated to Burton, and supposedly based upon Guernsey &#145;prophesyings&#146; on <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, through calendar calculations and allegorical exegesis it looked to episcopacy's fall and the rise of presbyterianism. In April 1642 parliament appointed de la Marche one of two Guernsey ministers in the Westminster assembly of divines.<br>
<br>On 6 February 1642 de la Marche preached at the French church, Threadneedle Street, London, against hierarchy. This provoked a rebuke from its administration, as did a millenarian sermon he delivered a little later. On 6 June 1642 he preached there on the apocalyptic fate of earthly monarchies, a subject to which he was to return, to the point of encouraging regicide. His precocious and ardent opinions did not prevent his appointment to the French church in May 1643, a position made official that September. He presided over the colloquy of the French churches in England in 1644.<br>
<br>De la Marche is not known ever to have returned to Guernsey, although he remained in touch with the island, and in June 1643 there were moves there to dismiss him from St Andrew. Nor did he lack opposition in England. The royalist Louis H&eacute;rault, appointed a minister of the French church in 1643, soon returned to France. Between 1645 and 1648 Christopher Cisner complained of de la Marche's radicalism, his dictatorial behaviour, and his own exclusion from the church's ministry. Although this divided the congregation, de la Marche remained in office. His commitment to the presbyterian cause, though radical, was not in doubt. The <span class="italic">Complaint</span> was reissued in 1645 as <span class="italic">A Revelation of the Time, and Fall of the English Hierarchy of Prelates</span>, a year before episcopacy was abolished and limited presbyterianism introduced. In a table the book anticipated in 1650 the &#145;last great period of the &hellip; journey, and the end of it&#146;  (2&#150;3); de la Marche died in London on 14 October 1651.<br>
