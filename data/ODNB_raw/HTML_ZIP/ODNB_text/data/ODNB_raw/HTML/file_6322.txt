<span class="headword">Cornelius,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1557&#150;1594), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, possibly a son of Gervase Cornelius and Maud (or Mary) Buckingham, was born in Bodmin, Cornwall. His parents were Irish and, though living in the humblest station, are said to have sprung from the illustrious family of the O'Mahons. His patron, Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, sent him to Oxford. Elected a fellow of Exeter College on 30 June 1575 he was expelled for popery by royal commission on 3 August 1578. He arrived at the English College in Rheims on 26 September 1579. He was sent on to the English College in Rome on 9 February 1580, arriving on 1 April. Ordained deacon on 10 October 1581 he preached in the presence of Pope Gregory XIII on the feast of St Stephen, 26 December 1581. He departed for England in September 1583 shortly after his ordination to the priesthood. Sir John Arundell received him; in March 1588 he was living with Arundell at his house in Muswell Hill. After Arundell's death on 17 January 1591 Cornelius accompanied his widow, Anne, daughter of Edward, third earl of Derby, and formerly widow of Charles, seventh Lord Stourton, to Chideock Castle, Dorset.<br>
<br>Like his friend the Jesuit William Weston, Cornelius was a noted exorcist. According to the Jesuit John Gerard, Cornelius was<blockquote>so famous in preaching that all Catholics followed him as children do their nurse when they long for milk, and the man so full of the Apostle's charity, that with one fervent speech in imitation of the offer which St. Paul made to be <i>&#145;anathema pro fratribus&#146;</i>, he expelled a devil out of a person whom he was exorcising. I know the time and place where it was performed; and where another wicked spirit confessed in a possessed person that his fellow was cast out by Cornelius his charity. (Morris, 17&#150;18)</blockquote>On 14 April 1594, however, Sir George Trenchard raided Chideock Castle. After a search of five or six hours someone led the pursuivants to the priest hole where Cornelius was hiding. Thomas Bosgrave, a Cornish gentleman and kinsman of Sir John Arundell, was taken into custody at the same time, as were two servants of the Arundell family.<br>
<br>Imprisoned in Trenchard's house Cornelius met a number of protestant divines and engaged them in debate. One of these divines, named Charke (possibly William Charke), was &#145;easily their leader and principal in the whole of the county&#146;  (<span class="italic">Elizabethan Jesuits</span>, 224). According to More, Sir Walter Ralegh also discussed unspecified issues with Cornelius for one night in order &#145;to remove his doubts&#146;. Despite Ralegh's displeasure at something Cornelius said about atheism the courtier promised to intercede with Elizabeth I on the priest's behalf. At the end of April, Cornelius was ordered to London, to Marshalsea prison, where, despite being tortured, he revealed nothing that would prejudice his benefactors. In late June he was remanded to Dorchester for trial, where he and his three companions were found guilty: Cornelius of high treason for being a priest and coming into the kingdom and remaining there, Bosgrave and the servants of felony for aiding Cornelius, knowing him to be a priest. They were executed at Dorchester on 3 or 4 July 1594.<br>
<br>Whether Cornelius died a Jesuit is somewhat controversial. In late 1588 Henry Garnet reported to Claudio Acquaviva, Jesuit superior-general, that John Cornelius wished to enter the Society of Jesus. Garnet, however, was reluctant to send him to the Spanish Netherlands. He feared that Jesuit authorities there would reject Cornelius's application on account of his health, and he was unwilling to take Cornelius away from his flock. Garnet admitted that Cornelius always lived with a Jesuit and would not suffer if his noviceship was postponed or, indeed, if he were allowed to make it in England. In a letter to Garnet some time after his capture Cornelius still hoped to be admitted into the society. After Cornelius's martyrdom, Garnet explained how much he had tried to console the priest, but it was not within his power to accept him into the society. However, on his own initiative Cornelius pronounced Jesuit vows before his execution and instructed three unnamed principal Catholics who witnessed the event to inform Garnet of what he had done.<br>
