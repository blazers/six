<span class="headword">Wight,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">advocate and writer on election law</span>, was the son of David Wight, writer, of Edinburgh. Wight attended the University of Edinburgh between 1745 and 1748. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 6 March 1754 and in time established himself as a leading counsel. In 1773 he published, with a dedication to Lord Mansfield, <span class="italic">A treatise on the laws concerning the election of the different representatives sent from Scotland to the parliament of Great Britain, with a preliminary view of the constitution of the parliaments of England and Scotland before the union of the two kingdoms</span>. Wight revised and updated the <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, his researches resulting in a more substantial work which appeared in 1784 as <span class="italic">An inquiry into the rise and progress of parliament, chiefly in Scotland; and a complete system of the law concerning the elections of the representatives from Scotland to the parliament of Great Britain</span>. The work was seen as authoritative; a new and updated edition in two volumes, with cases arranged by William Maxwell Morison, appeared in 1806. It remained the standard work on the subject up to the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832. Principal Robertson referred to it in his <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> when he wrote<blockquote>Various questions concerning the constituent members of the Scottish parliament, concerning the era at which the representatives of the boroughs were introduced into that assembly; and concerning the origin and power of the committee of the lords of articles, occur, and have been agitated with great warmth. Since the first publication of this work, all these disputed points have been considered with calmness and accuracy in Mr Wight's <span class="italic">Inquiry</span>. (Robertson, 188n.)</blockquote>There are scant details with which to give a truly rounded portrait of Wight's career and character. He was an active member of several faculty committees, and in 1777 he was appointed to the dean's council by the dean of the faculty, Henry Dundas. In 1783 Wight succeeded Ilay Campbell as solicitor-general in the administration of the duke of Portland, to whom the <span class="italic">Inquiry</span> was dedicated; Wight's interest in electoral reform may have recommended him to the Foxite element in the Portland administration. However, in 1784 William Pitt the younger replaced him by Robert Dundas of Arniston. Wight's distance from his earlier association with Dundas was shown by his subsequent appointment as a councillor of state to the prince of Wales. Wight was vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and a director of the Musical Society of Edinburgh. He enjoyed a close friendship with another advocate, the gifted but dissipated Andrew Crosbie, and like Crosbie was financially embarrassed by the collapse of Douglas, Heron &amp; Co., the Ayr bank, of which he was a director. Wight was married to Marion Blyth (<i>d</i>. 1825), and died in Edinburgh on 18 March 1793.<br>
