<span class="headword">Cooke,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1824), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was descended from an old family originally from Cheshire, but for some time settled in Cork. He was educated at Cork grammar school, and afterwards by a private tutor. At the age of nineteen he married a lady of considerable fortune, but squandered a large portion of it, and lost nearly all the remainder in his business, that of a woollen manufacturer. His first wife died after about three years, and later in life he married his second wife, Maria, identified only as a sister of a late Major Galway.<br>
<br>In 1766 Cooke left Cork for London with strong recommendations to the duke of Richmond, the marquess of Lansdowne, Edmund Burke, and Oliver Goldsmith, whose friendship he retained through life. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1777, and for one or two years went on the home circuit, but already occupied himself chiefly with literature. His earliest publication was a poem entitled <span class="italic">The Art of Living in London</span>, which met with some success, and in 1807 he published another of greater pretension, entitled <span class="italic">Conversation</span>, in the fourth edition of which, published in 1815, he introduced the characters of several of the members of the well-known literary club in Gerrard Street, Soho, such as Burke, Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Goldsmith.<br>
<br>Contemporary biographical accounts usually present Cooke's relationship with Goldsmith as amicable and mutually congratulatory. Some twentieth-century commentators, however, suggest that Cooke's &#145;anecdotes&#146; or &#145;reminiscences&#146; of Goldsmith were less than charitable, and show a tendency to paint the more famous author as something of a simpleton. To one of Goldsmith's biographers, R. M. Wardle, Cooke was a &#145;goon&#146; who was often among those who were &#145;more interested in telling an effective story (and perhaps incidentally suggesting an intimacy with the great) than in checking the accuracy of their information&#146;  (Wardle, 5, 190, 290). It seems, however, that Goldsmith maintained his friendship with Cooke, regardless of the latter's own inconsistencies.<br>
<br>Cooke also authored <span class="italic">Elements of Dramatic Criticism</span> (1775); <span class="italic">The Capricious Lady</span>, a comedy, altered from Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Scornful Lady</span> (1783); <span class="italic">Memoirs of C. Macklin</span> (1806), the actor, including a history of the stage during Macklin's lifetime; and <span class="italic">Memoirs of Samuel Foote, with some of his Writings</span> (3 vols., 1805). He died at his house in Piccadilly on 3 April 1824, at a very advanced age.<br>
