<span class="headword">Greenwood,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1752?, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">scene-painter</span>, is believed to be the son of the engraver John Greenwood (1729&#150;1768), who may have come to London from Yorkshire where there was a thriving branch of the family. Thomas Greenwood was not, however, related to the American-born painter John Greenwood (1727&#150;1792) who settled in England in 1763, and exhibited at the Society of Artists. His parents may have been John Greenwood and Elizabeth Holroyd, who married in St George's Chapel, Hyde Park, London, on 1 July 1750. If so, it is likely that he was the Thomas Greenwood whose baptism was recorded in London at St Andrew, Holborn, on 23 February 1752, and that he was nineteen in November 1771 when we have the earliest definite evidence of his career, from an account book for the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, which records a payment to him, possibly for work on the spectacular masque <span class="italic">The Institute of the Garter</span>. Greenwood worked at Drury Lane from 1771 until his death in 1797, becoming chief scene-painter there in 1776 after the death of John French, who had held the post since 1765. On 13 August 1774 he married, at St Leonard's, Shoreditch, Elizabeth Meaburn, with whom he had several children, including a son Thomas, baptized at St Andrew, Holburn, on 4 April 1779.<br>
<br>Greenwood did not work exclusively at Drury Lane, since he also worked for the 1777&#150;8 season at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and for Sadler's Wells Theatre from 1778 to 1797; he was the first scene-painter to be associated with that theatre. Other work included repainting the interior of Drury Lane with William Capon (1757&#150;1827), before the opening of the 1782&#150;3 season; painting scenery for Privy Garden, the duke of Richmond's private theatre, in 1788; for theatrical entertainments at Blenheim Palace, in 1778; for the King's Theatre, in 1791&#150;4, when the Drury Lane Company were playing there, and in 1795 for the new Theatre Royal, Birmingham, which opened the following year.<br>
<br>Greenwood started working at Drury Lane at a time of great change and innovation in scene design on the British stage, when David Garrick's improvements there in lighting and the mechanics of mounting scenery on stage made scene design more exciting and creative than was formerly possible. He may have begun working at Drury Lane Theatre as a pupil of French (just as Andrew Roberts later became Greenwood's pupil at Sadler's Wells), but probably most influential for his work was that of the innovative scene designer Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg (1740&#150;1812), whom David Garrick employed at Drury Lane from 1772 as scenic director. De Loutherbourg, noted for his creation of spectacular stage effects, had taken the unusual step of stipulating that Garrick employ him solely as a scene designer, with overall authority to supervise the execution of his ideas, and hence Greenwood's early work for Drury Lane entailed realizing many of de Loutherbourg's designs, including <span class="italic">Maid of the Oaks</span> (1774) and <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> (1775). Generally in the eighteenth-century theatre artists who designed scenery painted it themselves, and by 1778 Greenwood was realizing his own designs and his name was credited in playbills accordingly.<br>
<br>Greenwood excelled at landscape and topographical work, and the two anonymous watercolour designs credited to him in the Victoria and Albert Museum (believed to be scenes for Covent Garden Theatre, 1777), reveal his mastery of architectural detail and perspective, and an appreciation of the dramatic effect of monumental backdrops. Much of Greenwood's work was for opera and pantomime, which demanded a wide variety of settings, especially at the rebuilt Drury Lane Theatre of the 1790s, where audiences loved spectacular presentations on the enlarged stage. Thomas Greenwood died in October or November 1797 at his home in Charles Street, Covent Garden, London, and was described in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as &#145;an artist of great eminence, and conductor of the painting department of Drury Lane theatre&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 984). His last work there was for <span class="italic">The Castle Spectre</span>, which opened at Drury Lane in December 1797, and for which his son, Thomas Greenwood (1779&#150;1832), completed his work, with Charles Pugh. Greenwood was succeeded at Drury Lane by his son, who designed much of the scenery for Edmund Kean's performances at Drury Lane in 1814&#150;15. Thomas junior's son was the theatrical manager and writer Thomas Longdon Greenwood (1808&#150;1879). Elizabeth Ann Greenwood was executrix and sole beneficiary of her father's will, proved on 11 November 1797.<br>
