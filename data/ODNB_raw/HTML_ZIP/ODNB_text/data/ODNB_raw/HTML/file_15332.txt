<span class="headword">Kemp,  Thomas Read</span>  (1782&#150;1844), <span class="occ">property speculator</span>, was born on 23 December 1782, at 169 High Street, Lewes, Sussex, the younger surviving child and only son of Thomas Kemp (<i>bap</i>. 1745, <i>d</i>. 1811), wool merchant and MP, and his wife, Anne (1748/9&#150;1807), daughter of Henry Read, grazier, of Brookland, Kent. He attended Westminster School and was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1800, where he graduated BA in 1805, and to the Middle Temple in 1804. On 12 July 1806 he married Frances (1783&#150;1825), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1382/', "Sir Francis Baring bt")</script>, with whom he had four sons and six daughters. In the following year he purchased Herstmonceux Place, Sussex, where they lived until he sold it in 1819, and they moved to The Temple, Montpelier Road, Brighton. A drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1808 shows a handsome, fashionable gentleman.<br>
<br>Having stood unsuccessfully for a county seat in 1807, Kemp was returned unopposed as MP for Lewes in the by-election following his father's death in 1811. In 1816 he resigned his seat. He served as vice-president of the Church Missionary Society from 1812 to 1816. Under the influence of his wife's sister Harriet Wall, he joined with her brother George Baring to found an evangelical sect, set up chapels in Lewes and Brighton, and preached regularly. In 1823 he returned to the Church of England, to fashionable society and an extravagant style of living, and to politics, by being elected MP for Arundel. In the general election of 1826 he regained a seat at Lewes, serving in five successive parliaments until 1837. A whig, he was a champion of parliamentary reform and also supported several radical measures, particularly free trade. He seldom took part in debates, except on local issues. In Brighton and Lewes he was a prominent figure, for example acting as a town commissioner in Brighton, receiving the king and queen on their visit to Lewes in 1830, supporting many charities, and riding with the Brighton Union hunt.<br>
<br>Kemp's wealth was founded on lands which his father had inherited from an uncle in 1774. The most valuable part was the freehold of nearly half the parish of Brighton outside the old town, onto which housing for the burgeoning resort had been spreading, piecemeal, since the 1770s. In 1823 he initiated the development of Kemp Town, on 40 acres a mile east of the old town. His intention was to profit from providing what Brighton lacked, houses of the size and distinction as, for example, were being built in terraces around Regent's Park in Marylebone. To plans by Charles Augustin Busby and Amon Henry Wilds, the sites for 106 houses were laid out. A square opened from the centre of a crescent which was terminated by terraces parallel with the cliff, and communal gardens and esplanades gave access to the beach. Kemp financed the external construction of ninety-two houses, which had been erected by the end of 1828; they were let on ninety-nine-year building leases with the option to purchase at a fixed price. He also fitted out and occupied one, 22 Sussex Square, where he entertained in grand style. He gave the site of the Sussex County Hospital and &pound;1000 towards the hospital. But with the collapse of the 1824&#150;8 building boom tenants were slow in completing their houses, and it was only, for Kemp too late, in the 1840s that the development was counted a success. The flow of income was far below what was needed to support the expenditure incurred.<br>
<br>Kemp's wife died in 1825. On 26 November 1832 he married Frances Margaretta, daughter of Charles Watkin John Shakerley, of Somerford Park, Cheshire, and widow of Vigors Harvey, of Killiane Castle, Wexford. They had one son, Frederick (<i>b</i>. 1833).<br>
<br>In April 1837 Kemp resigned his seat in the Commons, let his houses in Kemp Town and in London (at 24 Belgrave Square, Chelsea), and left Britain to live on the continent for the rest of his life except for a visit in 1840&#150;41. The principal reason was financial: his extravagance and the failure so far of Kemp Town had overwhelmed him. Mortgages secured on his first marriage settlement and on Kemp Town amounted to at least &pound;84,000. His finances continued to deteriorate. Land in Brighton was auctioned in 1842, as was his London house early in 1844.<br>
<br>Kemp died on 20 December 1844 at 64 rue du Faubourg St Honor&eacute;, Paris, and was buried in the cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise. His wife returned to spend most of her remaining years in Kemp Town, before dying in Tunbridge Wells in 1860.<br>
