<span class="headword">Stansby,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1572, <em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was baptized on 8 July 1572 in the parish of St Mary Major, Exeter. His father, Richard (<i>d</i>. 1594), was a cutler who had lost his first wife and family in the plague of 1570 and his mother was Elizabeth Maunder (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1608). His parents married the following year on the anniversary of William's baptism in the neighbouring church of St Mary Arches. Stansby was indentured as the apprentice of the London printer John Windet from Christmas 1589, and was freed as a member of the Stationers' Company on 7 January 1597. Windet, who had moved to the Cross Keys in Thames Street in London in 1588, came from the same parish in Exeter as Stansby, and was a cousin of the theologian Richard Hooker.<br>
<br>Stansby appears to have spent all of his early career with Windet, who printed a mix of godly books, psalm books, music, some poetry, and history as well as proclamations and other official material for the City of London. The business had close connections with Lambeth Palace. In June 1607 Windet lost his apprentice George Vokes, two other workmen, and his wife to the plague. As Windet had no children, Stansby became Windet's co-partner early in 1609. Windet made his will on 21 November 1610 and he died before 17 December.<br>
<br>Following Windet's death Stansby transformed the Cross Keys printing house by investing in a large quantity of new type. Windet's emphasis on small godly books with long print runs was replaced by an emphasis on substantial works of antiquarian and historical interest that were printed in much smaller quantities. The shift in production was reflected in the authors and, perhaps, customers who frequented Stansby's printing house.<br>
<br>Stansby is best-known as the printer of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Workes</span> (1616), though many of his other books are almost as famous. He was to print books by John Donne, Sir Walter Ralegh, William Camden, John Selden, Michael Drayton, Sir Francis Bacon, Samuel Purchas, and several others of note. He provided specialist composition in Anglo-Saxon, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, as well as being the first English printer to print woodblocks of Japanese and a number of other languages. The establishment was probably the second largest press in London after the royal printing house and appears to have employed at least fifteen to seventeen staff. Stansby usually produced work of a better quality than most of the trade.<br>
<br>As with any printing house of the time, Stansby printed many sermons and other religious tracts. His religious beliefs appear to have been conventional, although the clues are few. He rarely wrote prefatory material for the books he published. Two fines for swearing recorded in the records of the Stationers' Company, however, suggest a forthright temperament that is also reflected in the determination with which he built up the business. He avoided senior positions within the Stationers' Company and on occasion came into conflict with the authorities.<br>
<br>Although Stansby had printed questionable authors such as John Traske, his reputation suffered a more serious setback when he printed John Selden's <span class="italic">History of Tithes</span>. As Selden later described to Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc, the bishop of London raided Stansby's printing house, seizing both type and manuscript. When the book returned to the press, Stansby reprinted three further editions surreptitiously. For the next few years he became a recalcitrant and difficult member of the trade.<br>
<br>Most of the entries in the Stationers' Company records relating to Stansby during 1620&#150;21 are a record of conflict: foreigners ordered to be put away, fines imposed and unpaid, a book not properly licensed, and a dispute over the right to reprint Ralegh's <span class="italic">A History of the World</span>. To make matters worse, Stansby and Nathaniel Butter were arrested at an unknown date during the early 1620s for printing a pamphlet concerning the succession of Ferdinand II to the crown of Bohemia. In order to obscure its origins, the pamphlet had been given a false imprint. Stansby nearly lost his business and reformed his behaviour. Thereafter, he was granted a share in the company's joint-stock venture, English Stock, and was elected to the livery of the Stationers' Company.<br>
<br>During the plague years of 1624&#150;5 Stansby served as a churchwarden for St Peter Paul's Wharf. It was shortly after this that he acquired the rights to all the copies of the printer Thomas Snodham. The matter was disputed at the time by the printer George Wood, but Wood's relationship with the company had been, if anything, worse than Stansby's and the assignment stood. The most important part of this transfer involved a great many books covered by the music privilege. Although Stansby did not print any music books between 1614 and 1628, he was one of the partners in the music stock at his death.<br>
<br>During the mid-1620s the character of Stansby's business also changed. He became a wealthier, more established member of the company. The death of the printer Richard Field in 1624 allowed him to reclaim Windet's former privilege for printing psalm books which Field had held since Windet's death. He increasingly printed almanacs and catechisms. All three were highly profitable and depended upon long print runs rather than intensive composition. Much of his output of this material, when it survives, survives only in very small quantities.<br>
<br>By the early 1630s Stansby's output appears to have diminished. It is unclear whether this is largely an illusion, the result of lost material, or whether upon reaching the age of sixty he decided to take things easier. Probably an element of both is true. The records of the Stationers' Company at this time show him not printing one book, badly printing a second, and being bought out of his share of the copy for a third. A degree of recalcitrance seems to have replaced his earlier determination. On 13 December 1635 he was granted a third share of a patent to print music and music paper but in early 1636 he sold his business to Richard Bishop for &pound;700. According to Stansby's will his share in the English Stock was worth &pound;160, and of the music patent &pound;60. The value of his estate as a whole was probably in the region of &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Stansby died at some point between 9 September 1638, when his will was made, and 14 September, when the will was proved. He left a wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1649), but their marriage had been childless. As a consequence, apart from Elizabeth, the principal beneficiaries of Stansby's estate were his sister Ruth and her husband John Dove, of Exeter, and his cousin Ruth and her husband Jonathan Shelborne, of London. Stansby also left bequests to the daughter of his uncle John Stansby, his former apprentice John Carwithing, the publisher John Smethwick, and the grocer Thomas Finch. He was buried in the chancel of St Peter Paul's Wharf on 17 September. Elizabeth continued to live at the Cross Keys, and was later buried with her husband in the chancel on 11 September 1649. John Stansby, the scrivener, was a cousin.<br>
