<span class="headword">Melville,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1599&#150;1631), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18548/', "Sir James Melville")</script> of Halhill (1535/6&#150;1617), privy councillor and author of memoirs, and Christine Boswell. Elizabeth married John Colville, who became commendator of Culross in 1597 until 1609; he appears to have become a minister in the parish of Culross until his death. She had three sons: Samuel Colville, who sustained the literary preoccupations of the Melville family&#151;he was the author of <span class="italic">The Scots Hudibras, or, The Whig's Supplication</span>; James Colville; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6007/', "Alexander Colville")</script>, who became professor of divinity at St Andrews. The date of her death is unknown, but she may have died in 1640, or possibly later.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Melville's life and art are inextricable: the spiritual homiletic voice of her major work, <span class="italic">Ane Godlie Dreame</span> (first published by Robert Charteris in 1603), is mirrored in her probable vocation as a preacher; her faith was publicly manifest in political gestures of support for exiled and excommunicated presbyterian ministers such as William Ridge of Adderny, John Welsh, Robert Blair, and John Livingstone. &#145;A Sonnet Sent to Blackness to Mr John Welsch, by the Lady Culross&#146; (<i>c</i>.1606) confirms Melville's pragmatic faith. Welsh belonged to the faction of dissenting ministers who opposed the ecclesiastical reforms of James VI and I. At Aberdeen in July 1605 Welsh was accused of treason; from the Tolbooth in Edinburgh he was sent to Blackness on 26 July of the same year. Melville's poem communicates spiritual support and courage to a religious ally.<br>
<br>Melville's life is largely recreated through witnesses in the Calvinist and covenanting communities. In the early 1600s Livingstone's autobiography refers to &#145;the lady Culross&#146; as an exemplar of &#145;sundry gracious Christians who used to resort to my father's house [that of William Livingstone, minister at Monyabrook], especially at times of, the communion&#146;  (Livingstone, &#145;Memorable characteristics&#146;, 346). In 1599 the protestant minister Alexander Hume dedicated his <span class="italic">Hymnes, or, Sacred Songs</span> to Melville, his &#145;sister&#146; in Christ and &#145;a Ladie chosen of God to bee one of his saincts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 3). Hume instructs the young woman to sustain and nurture her vocation as a spiritual daughter, and praises her &#145;compositiones so copious, so pregnant, so spirituall&#146; (five years before the publication of her major work). Hume's adoration of Melville's affective piety, &#145;sighing &amp; weepinge &hellip; in murmuring and in paine&#146;  (ibid., 3&#150;4), is echoed in the much later account of Melville at a devotional meeting in Shotts in June 1630:<blockquote>William Ridge of Adderny coming into the room, and hearing her have great motion upon her, although she spake not out, he desired her to speak out, saying, that there was none in the room but him and her woman &hellip; She did soe, and the door being opened, the room filled full. She continued in prayer, with wonderfull assistance, for large three hours time. (Livingstone, &#145;Memorable characteristics&#146;, 347)</blockquote>It seems that she may have received formal spiritual instruction, according to Livingstone, from &#145;the godly and able ministers and professors of Scotland&#146;  (&#145;Brief historical relation&#146;, 138).<br>
<br>Melville's faith is enshrined in her own extant letters to Livingstone and to her son James. The former, written <i>c</i>.1626&#150;31, convey her anxiety that the minister communicate with her regularly; she confesses her own fragility at times (through events in her family and the parish), yet exhorts Livingstone in a powerful, scriptural prose to have courage throughout the period of his excommunication in Ireland: &#145;mak gude that new covenant&#146;, she urges  (Livingstone, &#145;Memorable characteristics&#146;, 364). Her letters serve as meditations on her relationship with God, the nature of suffering and endurance through devotion, as well as the earthly trials afforded by her errant son at court.<br>
<br>Melville's <span class="italic">Ane Godlie Dreame</span>, composed &#145;at the request of friends&#146;, reflects medieval and Renaissance conventions of female spiritual &#145;autobiography&#146;, but is an allegory moulded by the doctrinal exigencies of Melville's Calvinism. Structured literally and metaphorically as a pilgrimage or journey, the poem depicts the visitation of Christ, who leads the dreamer through a variety of physical trials; on wakening, the dreamer expounds the allegorical significance of the journey. Melville's language is a complex weave of scriptural quotations, while the intimacy of faith is embodied in the dreamer's relationship with Christ, guide and bridegroom. The number of reprintings of Melville's poem throughout the seventeenth century, and its Anglicization, attest its popularity. Melville's life affords insight into a spiritual community, and the role of women within that; she stands as one of the most important religious writers in Renaissance Scotland.<br>
