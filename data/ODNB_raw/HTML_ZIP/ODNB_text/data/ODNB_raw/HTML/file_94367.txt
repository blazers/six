<span class="headword">Murray, Dame  (Alice) Rosemary</span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">chemist and university administrator</span>, was born on 28 July 1913 at South Leigh Cottage, South Leigh, Warblington, Hampshire, the eldest of six children (three daughters and three sons) of Lieutenant (later Vice-Admiral) Arthur John Layard Murray (1886&#150;1959), naval officer, and his wife, Ellen Maxwell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spooner (<i>d</i>. 1976), daughter of the celebrated Oxford figure <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36219/', "William Archibald Spooner")</script>. Her father served in HMS <i>Agamemnon</i> in the English Channel and Dardanelles during the First World War, and then in the Dvina River flotilla during the north Russian campaign immediately after (in which he was wounded, and for which he received the DSO and was appointed OBE). After a series of increasingly senior postings he was senior naval officer, Red Sea, in the early part of the Second World War, until invalided in 1943.<br>
<br>Both of Rosemary Murray's parents held relatively progressive views on women's education and career opportunities. She was educated at Downe House, Newbury, and at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, graduating with a second-class degree in chemistry in 1936; she stayed on to take her DPhil in 1938. She was immediately appointed as a lecturer in chemistry at Royal Holloway College, London; she taught there until 1941, then (after a brief assignment as experimental officer in the Admiralty Signals Establishment) at Sheffield University until 1942. After this she spent four years in the Women's Royal Naval Service, travelling a good deal by air to visit Wrens on overseas postings. She ended her service as a chief officer, directing demobilization at Chatham barracks.<br>
<br>In 1946 Murray became a lecturer in chemistry at Girton College, Cambridge; she became a fellow in 1949 and tutor in 1951, and was a university demonstrator in chemistry from 1947 to 1952. Until 1948 Cambridge women students did not have full degree status, and even after this was granted male students outnumbered female by some ten to one. Murray became secretary of the Third Foundation for Women, an association aiming to create a third Cambridge college for women (after Girton and Newnham). In 1954 she was appointed first tutor-in-charge of New Hall, then based in Silver Street, accepting the first sixteen undergraduates that year. Student numbers were initially limited by the accommodation available, but in 1962 the Darwin family gave their home, The Orchard, on Huntingdon Road, and building work (to designs by Chamberlin, Powell, and Bon) was completed in 1965, with accommodation for up to 300 undergraduates. Murray became the first president of New Hall in 1964, remaining in post until 1981, and seeing New Hall gain full collegiate status in 1972. In 1980 she wrote a short booklet, <span class="italic">New Hall, 1954&#150;1972: the Making of a College</span>.<br>
<br>Murray's talent for administration was soon recognized in the wider university, and, having served on numerous university committees, in 1975 she became Cambridge University's first female vice-chancellor, with typical practical flair devising her own ceremonial robes, and remaining in place for the then usual two-year term until 1977. She took over at an inauspicious time, with the university wracked by student unrest, and against a background of inflation, pay restraint, cutbacks in higher education, and industrial unrest. Nevertheless she achieved much, introducing student representation on university committees, founding the Cambridge Society, and inaugurating the clinical medical school, the new music school, and West Road concert hall. She was appointed DBE on retirement as vice-chancellor in 1977.<br>
<br>Brought up to value public service, Murray served as a magistrate in Cambridge for thirty years, from 1953 to 1983, working primarily in the juvenile court. She became the first female deputy lieutenant of Cambridgeshire in 1982. She was a governor and chairman of Keswick Hall College of Education, Norwich, from 1953 to 1983, a member of council of the Girls' Public Day School Trust from 1969 to 1993, and president of the National Association of Adult Education from 1977 to 1980. Her committee skills were put to use by government in various capacities, including as a member of the Committee on Higher Education in Northern Ireland chaired by Sir John Lockwood (1963&#150;5), which led to the creation of the New University of Ulster, and a member of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (1971&#150;81). She was a director of Midland Bank Ltd (1978&#150;84), and an independent director of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (1981&#150;93). She received honorary fellowships of four Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and honorary degrees from eight universities.<br>
<br>Murray was multi-talented, and as president of New Hall was famed for her carpentry, plumbing, and other practical skills, which were frequently called upon. She enjoyed bookbinding and gardening (she was honoured by the naming of a new rose at the Chelsea flower show in 2004), and in retirement in Marston village, Oxford, helped out with reading practice at a local school (where she insisted on being called plain Rosemary). Her natural authority was tempered by fairness and an irrepressible cheerfulness. It was said that she &#145;had the enviable quality of actually liking people&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Oct 2004). She never married, but remained close to her siblings and their children. She died on 7 October 2004 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, of cerebrovascular disease.<br>
