<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oldfield,  Anne</span>  (1683&#150;1730), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the daughter of Anne Oldfield and her husband, whose name may have been James; she was born perhaps in Pall Mall. Her grandfather had made a good living at the George tavern on Pall Mall, and left several properties to her father. According to the anonymous <span class="italic">Authentick Memoirs</span>, her father mortgaged these to buy a post in the Horse Guards, but he died young, leaving Anne and her mother in the care of her uncle George, a hosier in St James's Street. George &#145;put her to School, where she soon took her Learning with admirable Proficiency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Authentick Memoirs</span>, 7). Anne and her mother then sheltered with her aunt Mrs Voss, at the Mitre tavern, St James. It was here, according to Egerton's biography of Oldfield, collected from several hands, that Anne was discovered by George Farquhar. The story runs that &#145;he heard Miss Nanny reading a Play behind the Bar, with so proper Emphasis, and such agreeable Turns suitable to each character, that he swore the Girl was cut out for the Stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>), and on Farquhar's recommendation John Rich took her into the Drury Lane company in 1699 at 15<i>s</i>. a week. She does not appear to have been given many roles during her first season: only Candiope in Dryden's <span class="italic">Secret Love</span> and Sylvia in John Oldmixon's <span class="italic">The Grove</span>. Cibber charts her slow rise through the company from:<blockquote>the Year 1699, Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> was first taken into the House, where she remain'd about a Twelve month almost a Mute and unheeded, 'till Sir <i>John Vanbrugh</i>, who first recommended her, gave her the Part of <i>Alinda</i> in the <span class="italic">Pilgrim</span> revis'd.</blockquote>However, <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span> (by John Fletcher, revised by Vanbrugh) was performed on 6 July 1700 for Mrs Oldfield's sole benefit, which implies she was considered more highly than Cibber's account of her coming &#145;but slowly forward 'till the Year 1703&#146; would suggest. In the 1700 season Oldfield performed two prologues, including one to the first play from Susannah Centlivre, <span class="italic">The Perjured Husband</span>. This was the beginning of a long collaboration between the two women. Oldfield also played Lucilia in Catharine Trotter's <span class="italic">Love at a Loss</span> and the prim, virtuous Ann of Brittanie in Trotter's <span class="italic">The Unhappy Penitent</span>. The following season she developed new roles, including Lady Sharlot, the shy younger sister in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Funeral</span>, Cimene in Bevil Higgins's <span class="italic">The Generous Conqueror</span>, and witty, bantering Jacinta in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The False Friend</span>, for which she also delivered the epilogue. Accounts for the period imply she was earning around &pound;70 for the season, less than Elizabeth Barry and Anne Bracegirdle at the other house, but considerably more than Mary Porter and Mrs Willis. The selection of roles and her salary suggest that Oldfield established herself more rapidly within the company than Cibber remembers.<br>
<br>About 1703 Oldfield began a long-term liaison with Arthur Mainwaring (1668&#150;1712), MP for Preston and an auditor for the imprests. He was a friend of Owen Swiny at the Haymarket, and was to support Anne's career and write several epilogues for her. 1703 was also the year that there was further opportunity for Oldfield to become a leading player. Susanna Verbruggen's illness and eventual death in childbirth meant Oldfield took on some of her roles, including Leonora in John Crowne's <span class="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</span>. Cibber gives a self-mocking account of rehearsals where:<blockquote>she could scarce prevail with me to rehearse with her the Scenes she was chiefly concern'd in with Sir <i>Courtly</i>, which I then acted. However, we ran them over with a mutual Inadvertancy of one another. I seem'd careless &hellip; she mutter'd out her Words in a sort of mifty manner at my low Opinion of her. (<span class="italic">BDA</span>)</blockquote>However, Cibber had to revise his opinion when he saw her perform, and she even inspired him to complete his <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span>, which he had put to one side with the loss of Mrs Verbruggen. Anne's improved position in the company is suggested by the verbal contract she negotiated with John Rich in March 1704, which was to run for five years at 50<i>s</i>. a week. Under this arrangement she took on many new parts; in 1703 these had included Victoria in Steele's <span class="italic">The Lying Lover</span> and Queen Mary in <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span>, by John Banks. The following season Oldfield guaranteed the success of Cibber's <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span> with her portrayal of Lady Betty Modish, a character written for her and partially drawn, Cibber confessed, from &#145;sentiments &hellip; originally her own, or only dress'd with a little more care that when they negligently fell from her lively Humour&#146;  (ibid.). She also brought her comic talent to Biddy Tipkin in Steele's <span class="italic">The Tender Husband</span> and Mariana in Peter Motteux's <span class="italic">Farewell Folly</span>. By 1705&#150;6 Oldfield was often performing opposite Robert Wilks in such leading parts as Lady Reveller in Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Basset Table</span>, Arabella in Thomas Baker's <span class="italic">Hampstead Heath</span>, and Silvia in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>. When the companies reorganized in 1706 and Oldfield moved to Swiny's management at the Haymarket, she was receiving 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. &#145;every day a Play shall be acted by the Company&#146;  (Lafler, 37). This move allowed Oldfield to take up many new roles, such as Elvira in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>, Florimel in his <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span>, Mrs Sullen in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>, Imoinda in Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>, Lady Lurewell in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, and Narcissa in Cibber's <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span>. However, the combination of companies also brought her into conflict with Anne Bracegirdle, who had been playing these kinds of part at the other house. Egerton tells a story of a contest between the two in the title role of Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span>, in which the town judged Oldfield the winner. Whether this contest actually took place or not, when Oldfield's benefit was set for 25 February 1707, before that of Mrs Bracegirdle, the latter left the stage in disgust.<br>
<br>Anne Oldfield moved regularly during the next few seasons, each time bettering her terms of employment. In January 1708 a united company for spoken drama was established at Drury Lane, and the Queen's Theatre, Haymarket, was reserved for music. Oldfield moved with the company and tried to enforce an agreement for a salary of 4 guineas per week &#145;and a Benefit-Play every year paying, only, out the Receipt Fourty-Pounds&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 7/3 fol. 104). Rich attempted to slice more than the stipulated &pound;40 house charge, pointing out that no actress was receiving more than 50<i>s</i>. per week, and it is not clear how the dispute was settled. However, in April 1709 Oldfield returned to the Haymarket and entered an agreement with Swiny for thirteen years at an annual salary of &pound;200 and a February benefit, as well as being free each summer. Zachary Baggs, Rich's treasurer, published the company accounts to rebuff accusations of underpaying actors, and alleged that Mrs Oldfield had been better off at Drury Lane, estimating her annual income at &pound;252 6<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. Finally, in 1711 Oldfield moved back to Drury Lane as a managing partner and sharer with the triumvirate of actor&#150;managers Cibber, Wilks, and Thomas Doggett. However, Doggett objected to a female sharer, and instead she was offered an assured &pound;200 each year and a charge-free benefit. This rose to 300 guineas a year, and her benefit, according to Cibber's estimate, brought her twice that. This made Oldfield one of the highest paid performers in the company, although the figures are provided by Cibber in his memoirs, and might be suspected of being glossed.<br>
<br>Anne Oldfield was to remain at Drury Lane for the remainder of her career, where she continued to expand her range of comic heroines and ladies of quality, such as Violante in Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Wonder</span>, as well as adding many more serious roles to her repertoire, among them Andromache in Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span>, Arpasia in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, Cleopatra in Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>, Indamora in his <span class="italic">Aureng-Zebe</span>, and the title roles in Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> and <span class="italic">Lady Jane Gray</span>. She appears to have been a confirmed whig, as was her partner, Mainwaring, although after his death her loyalty was questioned. Mainwaring died in November 1712, leaving her and their son, Arthur, the majority of his estate, with only &pound;1000 for his sister. The tory <span class="italic">Examiner</span> railed against this &#145;<i>Whig-Honesty</i>&#146; to &#145;a <i>Celebrated Actress</i>, who is too much admired upon the Stage to have any Enquiry made into her Conduct behind the Curtain&#146;  (Lafler, 106). But the whig <span class="italic">Flying-Post</span> came to her defence, vowing, &#145;I do not believe she is gone off [the whig cause]; so far from it, that I am credibly informed she has refused great Sums, because she insists upon her Lover's voting on our Side&#146;  (Egerton, 35). Oldfield's whiggish credentials were to be firmly established through her performance of the self-sacrificing Marcia in Joseph Addison's hit of 1713, <span class="italic">Cato</span>. The play gathered cross-party support for its nationalist sentiment, and often Oldfield and Booth would have to pause in their performances to allow the applause to die down. Fairly soon after Mainwaring's demise Anne began an affair with Charles Churchill (<i>c</i>.1678&#150;1745), a nephew (though illegitimate) of the first duke of Marlborough, and moved in his circle as if she were his wife. By him she had another son, Charles, who married Lady Catherine Walpole, the statesman's illegitimate daughter. Although Oldfield never left the stage, these alliances clearly left her financially secure, as her sale of &pound;1500 of South Sea stock in 1723 indicates.<br>
<br>One of Oldfield's greatest triumphs in the later years was her playing of Lady Townly in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span> in January 1728. Cibber, who had completed the play, was delighted at her performance, made her a gift of 50 guineas, and raved about her acting in the preface to the printed work. He had considerably revised his first impression of her and now found her:<blockquote>of a lively Aspect and a Command in her Mien, that like the principal Figure in the Finest Paintings, first seizes, and longest delights the Eye of the Spectator. Her Voice was Sweet, strong, piercing, and melodious: her Pronunciation voluble, distinct, and musical; and her Emphasis always placed where the Spirit of the Sense, in her Periods, only demanded it.</blockquote>Her benefit, which was the first in the 1729 season, apparently made her &pound;500, and she was given by &#145;several Persons of Quality, &amp;c. five, ten and twenty Guineas each&#146;. This was on top of her salary of 12 guineas a week. Mrs Oldfield was so renowned by 1729 that, on Richard Steele's death, a paper quipped that she &#145;hath obtained a reversionary grant of the Patent of Master of the Theatre-Royal in Drury-lane, granted by his Majesty King George the 1st&#146;  (Lafler, 157). Her final stage appearance was as Lady Brute in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span> on 28 April 1730. During her final illness she was loyally nursed by Margaret Saunders, whose acting career she had sponsored. Oldfield died at her home, 59 Grosvenor Street, London, on 23 October 1730, and her body was carried to Westminster Abbey, where she was buried on 27 October. Her will revealed the same financial acumen that had characterized all her affairs. She left the Grosvenor Street house she had had built to Charles Churchill and ordered her holdings converted into cash. Arthur Mainwaring was to have the interest on &pound;5000, and the capital sum when he was thirty. Oldfield left her mother 10 guineas and a &pound;60 annuity, Margaret Saunders had a &pound;10 annuity, and her aunt Jane Gourlaw the same. The remainder of the estate was divided, with one-third going to Charles Churchill and two-thirds to Arthur. Her share in the patent at Drury Lane passed back to Cibber, Wilks, and Booth. The sale of her effects, which were all &#145;in the most elegant and Fashionable manner&#146;, including books in French and English, lasted five days. Her popularity is confirmed by the two biographies which were rushed out within the year, the short, anonymous <span class="italic">Authentick Memoirs</span>, and Edmund Curll's longer biography written under the pseudonym William Egerton. The memoirs were printed with engravings taken from the many portraits painted of her, most significantly those by Godfrey Kneller and J. Richardson.<br>
