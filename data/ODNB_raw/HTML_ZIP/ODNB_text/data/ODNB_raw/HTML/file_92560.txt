<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Norris, Sir  Christopher Neil  Foxley-</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 16 March 1917 at 44 Tollemache Road, Claughton, Birkenhead, the son of John Percivall Foxley-Norris, a solicitor then serving as a captain and adjutant in the 3rd battalion of the Cheshire regiment, and his wife, Dorothy Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brabant-Smith. He was educated at Bramcote School, Scarborough (1926&#150;30), Winchester College (1930&#150;35), and Trinity College, Oxford (1935&#150;9), graduating with a second class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1938. Having won a Harmsworth scholarship to the Middle Temple, he stayed in Oxford for an extra year. He started flying when he joined Oxford University air squadron, being commissioned in the Reserve of Air Force Officers in December 1936. He relinquished this commission on being appointed to one in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in December 1938.<br>
<br>Foxley-Norris's RAF pilot training began in September 1939 at 9 flying training school, Hullavington, and he was &#145;authorised to wear a flying badge&#146; in November 1939. The following March he was posted to 1 school of army co-operation at Andover, and from there, in May, to 13 squadron, which had Lysanders at Douai in France&#151;a short-lived operational experience ended by the blitzkrieg and evacuation. With fighter pilots desperately needed he was then posted to 5 operational training unit at Aston Down, and during the battle of Britain served with three Hurricane squadrons&#151;nos. 111, 3, and 615 (county of Surrey), being shot down but baling out successfully. In April 1941 he was posted to the Central Flying School, then in May to 5 service flying training school as an instructor. After a period when &#145;non-effective, sick&#146; he was sent to Canada&#151;under the empire air training plan&#151;as a flying instructor, first with 36 service flying training school at Penhold, Alberta, then with 31 operational training unit at Debert, Nova Scotia. His tour ended when he was posted back to the UK in June 1943. He later described his Canadian experiences vividly in his autobiography.<br>
<br>Foxley-Norris's subsequent wartime career was on Beaufighter and Mosquito low-level anti-shipping operations. From 132 operational training unit he was posted to 143 squadron at North Coates, then to 131 group training unit, then in July 1943 to 2 operational training unit and from there back to 143 squadron&#151;now at St Eval in Cornwall, with a detachment at Portreath. There he was involved in a court martial, following a breach of security. He was acquitted, then posted to the Middle East, where he successively commanded two Beaufighter squadrons, no. 252 and then no. 603 (county of London), until January 1945. Repatriated at the beginning of that year, he was given command of his former squadron, no. 143, which operated Mosquitoes in an anti-shipping role and which he led until May. Later the same month he was awarded the DSO, the citation saying:<blockquote>This officer has a long and distinguished record of operational flying. He has completed numerous sorties on his third tour of duty, during which he has operated against a wide range of enemy targets &hellip; By his brilliant leadership, exceptional skill and determination, Wing Commander Foxley-Norris has contributed in good measure to the successes obtained.</blockquote>On 1 September 1945 Foxley-Norris was awarded a permanent commission; then after serving briefly with 2 group HQ he took the 1946&#150;7 Staff College course. From June 1947 he was on the air staff of reserve command, before returning to his alma mater, Oxford University air squadron, this time in command (1948&#150;51). On 10 November 1948 he married, in Oxford, the 29-year-old Joan Lovell Scott, the daughter of Major Percy Henry Hughes, army officer, and the divorced wife of John Frederick Turner Scott. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>From 1951 to 1953 Foxley-Norris was on the directing staff of the RAF Staff College. A tour in the Far East, on the planning staff of Far East headquarters, Singapore, during the Malayan emergency, followed; when he returned to the UK in May 1956 he was made OBE in the birthday honours. He then became officer commanding flying at West Malling and did an all-weather conversion at North Luffenham. From December 1956 he was on the fighter command HQ staff, and in October 1958 converted to Javelins at Leeming. From November that year he commanded successively the fighter stations Stradishall and West Malling, then from September 1960 was on the senior officers' war course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and in 1961 a student on the Imperial Defence College course.<br>
<br>A series of senior appointments followed: director of organization at the Air Ministry from 1962; air officer commanding 224 group, Far East air force, during the Indonesian confrontation&#151;having at his command a &#145;small air force&#146; of some 300 aircraft; then from July 1968 commander, NATO 2nd Tactical Air Force, and commander-in-chief, RAF Germany&#151;facing the Warsaw pact forces. Having been appointed CB in the 1966 birthday honours, in the 1969 new year honours Foxley-Norris was appointed KCB and in December 1970 he was promoted air chief marshal. With such a distinguished pedigree, command experience, and personal charisma, he was a front runner for the top RAF post, chief of the air staff. In the event, his last appointment was that of chief of personnel and logistics, a post which enabled him to use his considerable influence to improve service pay and pensions. He was made GCB in the 1973 new year honours and in April 1974 was placed on the retired list.<br>
<br>In retirement Foxley-Norris worked tirelessly for the Battle of Britain Fighter Association, of which he was chairman, and for&#151;among other good causes&#151;the Cheshire Homes, founded by his friend from Oxford University air squadron days, the bomber VC Leonard Cheshire; he served as chairman from 1974 to 1982, and later as president. A pipe-smoker, he was chairman of FOREST (the Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco). He also wrote a very readable autobiography, <span class="italic">A Lighter Shade of Blue: Lighthearted Memoirs of an Air Marshal</span> (1978). He died on 28 September 2003 at his home, Tumblewood, Northend Common, Henley-on-Thames, of pneumonia and hypertension, and was survived by his wife, Joan. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 29 January 2004.<br>
