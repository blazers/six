<span class="headword">Watson,  Thomas</span>  (1513&#150;1584), <span class="occ">bishop of Lincoln</span>, was born in 1513 in the diocese of Durham, probably at Nunstainton near Sedgefield. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1533. The humanist training he received there was to permeate all his later thought. Roger Ascham, his contemporary at St John's, refers to Watson in his <span class="italic">Scholemaster</span> as one of the best scholars ever bred by that college, and writes admiringly of his tragedy <span class="italic">Absolom</span>. Watson is also recorded as producing a translation of the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>, now lost, and a version of a sermon of St Cyprian. In his time he was known for his good humour as well as for his scholarship and other merits; it would appear that his posthumous reputation for being morose and sullen, as propounded by writers like Burnet and Strype, is unfounded in fact.<h2>
<a name="Catholicactivist"></a>Catholic activist</h2>Watson became a fellow of St John's in 1533, and proceeded MA in 1536. He received his degree in theology in 1543, the year in which he became domestic chaplain to Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, who collated him to two benefices in his patronage. In 1547 he added the vicarage of Buckminster, Leicestershire. He assisted Gardiner in opposing many of the changes of religion taking place in the early part of Edward VI's reign. On one occasion in that reign he preached a sermon in the north of England that almost led to his arrest and prosecution for treason. He was saved by the intervention of John Rough, formerly a Dominican and now a noted protestant preacher in Hull. When in December 1557 Rough was brought before the bishop of London charged with heresy, Watson did not return the favour. Rough appealed to Watson for clemency on the basis of their encounter in the previous reign, only to be stigmatized by him as a pestilent heretic who had done much hurt in the north; Rough was burnt at Smithfield. As chaplain to Gardiner, Watson was confined with him in the Fleet during 1550 and 1551, and was called as a witness at the bishop's trial, though in December 1551 he is found taking part in private discussions on the sacraments at the house of Sir Richard Morison.<br>
<br>After the accession of Mary, Watson continued to be an active promoter of the old faith. Throughout the reign he was a noted preacher and controversialist. On 20 August 1553, he gave a sermon at Paul's Cross in London before the mayor and aldermen, with the guilds in their livery, as well as several members of the council who had been sent by the queen to keep order. It was feared that the serious disorder that had accompanied the previous Sunday's sermon would be repeated, so Sir John Jerningham was dispatched with a guard of 200 men with bills and halberds, who stood around the pulpit and in the churchyard. Mary's bishop of London, Edmund Bonner, watched the proceedings from a window.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1553 Watson was sent by Gardiner, then chancellor of the University of Cambridge, to the vice-chancellor and senate of the university to act on his behalf in restoring the old religion, and to report back to him on the state of the colleges. On arrival Watson was admitted as master of St John's, and soon afterwards received his doctorate in theology. By 18 October, he was back in London, where he was a proctor at the meeting of convocation at St Paul's, as a firm advocate of the Catholic cause. Further ecclesiastical preferment followed, when on 18 November he became dean of Durham. His note as a preacher led to his being called in the following year to give two of the Lenten sermons before the queen on the third and fourth Fridays, in support of the traditional teaching about the real presence of Christ in the eucharist and the sacrificial nature of the mass (these were published as <span class="italic">Twoo notable sermons &hellip; concerninge the reall presence of Christes body and bloude in the blessed sacrament; also the masse, which is the sacrifice of the Newe Testament</span>, London, 1554; STC 25115).<h2>
<a name="BishopofLincoln"></a>Bishop of Lincoln</h2>Watson resigned the mastership of St John's in May 1554. He became actively involved in the prosecution of heresy, and took part in proceedings against John Hooper and others. In December 1556 he was appointed to the bishopric of Lincoln; his election by the cathedral chapter took place on 7 January 1557. Between his election and consecration he received a commission from Cardinal Pole to carry out a visitation of the University of Cambridge. Arriving there on 9 January 1557, he preached a sermon on Sunday 31 January in King's College against the doctrines of Martin Bucer, and promoting the restoration of certain ceremonies, referring particularly to the traditional usage of candles in procession on Candlemas (2 February). On the following Saturday (6 February), he preached at some length in Great St Mary's Church against the &#145;wyckedness and heretycall doctryn&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 1.492) of Martin Bucer (whose remains were interred there) and his fellow Cambridge reformer Paul Fagius, who was buried in St Michael's Church. Later that day the remains of Bucer and Fagius were disinterred and burnt publicly in the market place.<br>
<br>Over the next few months Watson is noted by the diarist Henry Machyn as preaching in London on a number of occasions: on 27 March before the queen, on 4 April at All Hallows-the-Great, &#145;wher was grett audyens of pepull&#146;, and on 22 April &#145;a godly sermon&#146; at St Mary Spital  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 131). The papal bull providing him to Lincoln was issued on 24 or 25 March, and in May he was given licence by Cardinal Pole to hold the deanery of Durham <i>in commendam</i> with his bishopric. He was consecrated bishop at Chiswick on 15 August by Archbishop Nicholas Heath of York (acting under commission from Pole), assisted by Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and William Glynn, bishop of Bangor. Watson's enthronement in his cathedral took place by proxy on 10 October, and in person on 15&#150;16 October. After his appointment he was active in restoring property to his cathedral church, including vestments, plate, and other furniture, and on 9 November obtained by letters patent a grant of some estates alienated ten years previously along with the patronage of a number of benefices in his diocese which had belonged to religious houses before the Henrician dissolutions. As bishop he continued his active preaching, and is recorded as giving &#145;a godly sermon&#146; at Paul's Cross in London on 20 February 1558 before the lord mayor, aldermen, ten bishops, judges and lawyers, and a great audience. He also produced a book of sermons, <span class="italic">Holsome and catholyke doctryne concerninge the seven sacramentes &hellip; set forth in maner of shorte sermons</span> (1558; STC 25112 ff.), for use in parish churches where the parish priest was not able or qualified to preach; this was one of a number of responses to the drive by Cardinal Pole to reform and revive the English church in the Catholic faith by the provision of educational material for the laity.<br>
<br>Watson's career was curtailed by the death of Queen Mary on 17 November of that year, and the accession of Elizabeth. He was one of the bishops appointed to dispute with a number of reformers at Westminster Abbey on 3 April 1559. The proceedings broke down when the bishops failed to produce the questions for their opponents that had been required of them. That night Watson, along with John White, bishop of Winchester, was sent by water to the Tower. The bishops were each allowed one of their own servants, and their own bedding and furniture. It is at this point that the sickness, which was to plague Watson for the rest of his life, first became apparent. The council instructed the lieutenant of the Tower to treat the bishops well, &#145;specially the Bysshopp of Lyncolne, for that he is syck&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1558&#150;70</i>, 78). Watson was permitted to join the lieutenant at his table &#145;for the better relief of his quartayne ague&#146;  (ibid., 93&#150;4).<h2>
<a name="PrisonerintheTower"></a>Prisoner in the Tower</h2>On 25 July Watson was deprived of his bishopric, and the next day released from confinement. A year later, on 26 June 1560, he was again sent to the Tower, whence he was discharged into the custody of Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, then to Edmund Guest (or Gheast) of Rochester, and finally to Richard Cox of Ely. According to Brady there is a paper in the Vatican archives that appears from internal evidence to have been written in 1560 with a view to making changes in the English hierarchy and filling vacant sees, on the basis that (as far as the Holy See was concerned) the remaining Catholic bishops were still in legal possession of their sees. The document suggests that the archbishop of York, Nicholas Heath, should be translated to Canterbury, and that Watson (who, it was noted, was at the time in prison) should become archbishop of York. This document, which reflects the ultimately unfounded hopes felt in some quarters in Rome and elsewhere at the time that Elizabeth might eventually settle on a restoration of Catholicism, also gives an indication of the esteem felt in the upper echelons of the church in Rome for the bishop of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Watson appears to have remained in the custody of Cox until January 1565, when he was once again sent to the Tower. After the publication in 1570 of the papal bull excommunicating Elizabeth, Watson and other leading Catholic prisoners were examined. His answers appear to have been moderate, showing due allegiance to the sovereign. None the less, he is noted as being in the Tower in March 1571; there he remained until 5 July 1574, when he was released by the privy council into the custody of his brother John. His health at this time was very poor, and he seems to have been half blind and disabled. A condition of his release was that he should place sureties with the archbishop of Canterbury that he would not act contrary to the laws of the established religion, nor seek to induce others to any such contrary act or opinion. He was not to leave his brother's house without licence of the council, and was to see only those visitors who had legitimate business with his brother. It appears that he failed to meet these conditions of his bail. On 24 June 1577 the council complained to the bishop of London that Watson, John Feckenham, the former abbot of Westminster, and others, had abused their bail and consorted with &#145;certen of her Majesties evill disposed subjectes &hellip; whom they have perverted in Religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1558&#150;70</i>, 371). Evidence corroborating Watson's part in such illegal activity is found in documents relating to the imprisonment in 1577 of Francis Tregian and his indictment for recusancy. Among the papers is a letter from William Wigges to Cuthbert Mayne, stating that he had sent to Mayne &#145;all his stuff&#146; (his portable mass set and vestments) which had been hallowed by the bishop of Lincoln (Watson), indicating that he continued to exercise episcopal functions even after his deprivation and confinement  (Morris, 85).<h2>
<a name="Finalcaptivityanddeath"></a>Final captivity and death</h2>The council responded to such activity by requiring new bonds of their keepers that they would not allow their charges to have any further contact with anyone on matters of religion. In Watson's case the council found this to be insufficient and on 28 July 1577 committed him to the custody of Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester. A letter of the council to Horne dated 11 August permitted Watson to have the use of one of his own servants; while reluctant to allow him to be served by one of his own religion, the council considered this less dangerous than providing him with a &#145;sound person&#146; whom he might corrupt. By the beginning of 1578 Horne was in poor health, and requested that he be allowed to be discharged of Watson's custody so that he might go to London to recover his health; the council replied on 16 January that he should come to London and bring his prisoner with him, as Watson too was in poor health and wished to go to London. Shortly afterwards, however, Horne was granted his request and on 19 February his charge was transferred to John Young, the newly appointed bishop of Rochester. Young was to attempt to bring Watson to conform, and to ensure that he was unable to corrupt anyone further in matters of religion.<br>
<br>The attempts of the council to prevent Watson, Feckenham, and others from influencing others in matters of religion was proving difficult to enforce. The beginning of the Jesuit mission to England, as well as the continuing influx of secular priests, was further complicating the situation. In 1580 a solution was offered by Richard Cox, namely that the recalcitrant clergy should be sent to a former palace of the bishops of Ely, which was suitable for use as a prison. Wisbech Castle had been rebuilt in brick between 1478 and 1483 by John Morton, then bishop of Ely, to be an episcopal residence. It stood on a high terrace surrounded by a moat. Possibly because of its location in the fens of East Anglia, later bishops allowed it to fall into disrepair, and by 1580 it was in a ruinous and dilapidated condition, as well as in what the Jesuit Robert Persons described as &#145;a most unhealthy spot&#146;  (Hicks, 79). Preparations were soon under way, undertaken on behalf of the bishop of Ely by two engineers and merchant adventurers, George Carleton and Humfrey Michell, who had been undertaking the draining of the fens. The two men notified the council of the completion of their preparations, and of the arrival of Feckenham and Watson, in a letter of 11 August. By October six more prisoners had joined them, and Carleton and Michell were seeking advice from the council as to whether the prisoners were to be allowed their own servants, and to take meals in common as had become their practice, despite the council's original insistence that Feckenham, at least, should be kept in solitary confinement. It seems that the prisoners were allowed no books other than a <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and were not permitted any writing instruments. The bishop of Ely had appointed a preacher to them, but they refused to listen to him or to attend Anglican services. Watson died in prison in Wisbech Castle in September 1584. He was buried in the church of St Peter and St Paul, just outside the castle, on 27 September.<br>
