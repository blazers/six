<span class="headword">Murdoch,  Mary Charlotte</span>  (1864&#150;1916), <span class="occ">physician and suffragist</span>, was born at 21 Institution Road, Elgin, on 26 September 1864, the youngest of seven children (three daughters and four sons) of William Murdoch (<i>d</i>. 1871), solicitor, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Macdonald (<i>d</i>. 1887). She was educated by governesses at home before attending Weston House School, Elgin, and then boarded at Manor Mount Girls' Collegiate School, Forest Hill, London, after which she had tuition from Madame Troilliet in Lausanne. She returned home in 1883, and in 1885 took care of her widowed and invalid mother until the latter's death. A legacy from her mother enabled her to pursue her ambition to become a doctor.<br>
<br>In 1888 Murdoch began her studies at the London School of Medicine, and ultimately obtained her qualifications in Scotland (after completing the third examination in 1892). After a midwifery course at the Maternity Hospital, Brighton, she gained experience as clinical assistant under Helen Webb in the outpatients' department of the New Hospital for Women, London, and attended Helen Mackenzie's outpatient department at Brompton Hospital. From 1893 to 1895 she was house-surgeon at Victoria Hospital for Children, Park Street, Hull, after which she spent a year at the Tottenham Fever Hospital where, under R. A. Birdwood, she gained experience in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. She returned to Hull in 1896 and became the first woman to practise medicine there. She set up in private practice, with additional consulting rooms in Grimsby, and was also senior physician at the Victoria Children's Hospital, Hull, where she showed a particular affinity with her young patients. From 1900 to 1906 her partner in private practice was Louisa Martindale, who later devoted a chapter of her autobiography to her association with Murdoch (or Murdie as she was known to her friends). A member of the British Medical Association after 1894, she was also active in the Association of Registered Medical Women and gave regular lectures to students at the London School of Medicine for Women. As a practitioner, she was known as a good diagnostician, and undertook scientific research into pericarditis and vaccine treatments.<br>
<br>Murdoch became a prominent and influential figure in the civic life of Hull. She promoted infant welfare in the city, founding the first cr&egrave;che and a school for mothers, while encouraging the male dock workers to take an active part in child rearing. Concerned about the conditions of working women, she founded a branch of the National Union of Women Workers in 1905. Her campaigns to improve social conditions required courage and toughness. She was involved in a public controversy in 1911 as a result of a paper which she delivered on the need to improve standards of housing and welfare, using the example of the poor conditions prevailing in Hull; members of the Hull Corporation and its sanitation committee objected to the poor light in which Hull had been cast. She promoted the election of women onto borough councils and took part in a deputation to the home secretary urging the appointment of female police officers. She founded and became president of the Hull Women's Suffrage Society, a branch of Millicent Fawcett's National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), which promoted the cause by constitutional means. She refused, however, publicly to condemn acts of suffragette militancy, and resigned from the NUWSS when it did so, joining instead the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union. Her friendship with Fawcett survived the rift. She attended several conferences of the International Council of Women, giving papers on &#145;Health and physical training&#146; in Toronto (June 1909), &#145;Rights of citizenship&#146; in Stockholm (September 1911), and &#145;Equal moral standards&#146; in Rome (1914), the latter reflecting her involvement in the purity campaign.<br>
<br>Energetic and tireless&#151;often taking only four or five hours' sleep&#151;Murdoch was fearless in her work and adventurous in her leisure. She was the first woman in Hull to own a car (a De Dion), which she drove at speed. She travelled widely, cycling across Belgium in 1902, and touring in Switzerland, Vienna, and Berlin with Louisa Martindale. Suffering recurring bouts of severe gastric illness since her time as a medical student, she became seriously ill in 1910 and underwent an operation. Her intentions to restrict her activities thereafter were not realized, and she continued to be a frequent public speaker. Shortly before her death, she was distressed by the closure of the infants' ward at the Victoria Hospital, and committed herself to raising the necessary funds to reopen it. Always interested in ethical matters, she joined the Church of England in 1914.<br>
<br>Murdoch was taken ill after attending an emergency call in snowbound conditions and died from influenza, gastroenteritis, and peritonitis at her home, 102 Beverley Road, Hull, on 20 March 1916. Her funeral was held at All Saints' Church, Margaret Street, Hull, on 24 March 1916, followed by cremation at the Hull crematorium; a requiem mass at St Francis Mission Church, Sculcoates Lane, Hull, was attended by representatives of the numerous local voluntary bodies which she had supported.<br>
