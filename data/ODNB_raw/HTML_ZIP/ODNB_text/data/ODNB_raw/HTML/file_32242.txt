<span class="headword">Cairns,  David Smith</span>  (1862&#150;1946), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 8 November 1862 at Stichill in Roxburghshire, the third of four children of the Revd David Cairns, minister of the United Presbyterian church there, and his wife, Elisabeth, daughter of the Revd Dr David Smith, of Biggar. After his schooling at Ednam and the high school, Kelso, he took his arts degree at Edinburgh University and studied theology at the United Presbyterian College in Edinburgh, of which his uncle, the celebrated <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4347/', "John Cairns")</script>, was principal, spending one semester also at Marburg University, where he was influenced by the Ritschlian theologian Wilhelm Herrmann.<br>
<br>Cairns was ordained in 1895 and became minister of the United Presbyterian church at Ayton, Berwickshire. In 1901 he married Helen Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of Henry Hewat Craw, gentleman farmer, of West Foulden, Berwickshire. They had one daughter and one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50935/', "David Cairns")</script>, later professor at Christ's College, Aberdeen. In 1907 Cairns became professor of systematic theology in the United Free Church college, Aberdeen, known after the church union of 1929 as Christ's College. He became principal in 1929 and taught at the college until he retired in 1937 and went to live in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Cairns took an active part in the life of the church and in many public movements. He played an important role in the World Missionary Conference that met in Edinburgh in 1910, and also prepared its significant report, <span class="italic">The Missionary Message in Relation to Nonchristian Religions</span>. Cairns also actively supported the growth of the Student Christian Movement. In addition he made a number of lecture tours both in America and in the Far East: he delivered the Deems lectures in New York University and Lafayette College after the First World War, and the Russell lectures in Auburn Theological Seminary in 1923. In 1927 he lectured in China and Japan. In 1932 he delivered the Baird lectures, later published as <span class="italic">The Riddle of the World</span> (1937). This volume has been described as &#145;his maturest exercise in apologetics&#146;  (Needham, 117).<br>
<br>In 1923 Cairns was elected moderator of the general assembly of the United Free church of Scotland. He received the honorary degree of DD from the universities of Aberdeen (1909), Debrecen (Hungary, 1929), and Edinburgh (1933), and of LLD from St Andrews (1937) and Aberdeen (1938). In 1918 he was appointed OBE in recognition of work done for the troops during the war.<br>
<br>Cairns was above all a Christian apologist, interpreting the Christian faith to his age in the light of modern science and historical criticism. In his undergraduate days he had passed through a profound crisis of religious doubt, under which his health broke down, and he had to interrupt his studies for a period of foreign travel. At this time the poet Robert Browning became his main spiritual guide (as recorded in his autobiography, published in 1950). When his faith was restored he was committed to the lifelong enterprise of thinking it out and giving theological help to other questioners. This he did not only in a succession of theological works, but in many more personal contacts, for which his warm human sympathy well fitted him. His thought was dominated by the conviction, which found its most original expression in his most influential book, <span class="italic">The Faith that Rebels</span> (1928), that the universe is not a closed system but a purposive universe, in which nothing is impossible to God, and therefore nothing is impossible to a human faith which absolutely trusted him, as Jesus did. It was along this line that he interpreted the miracles, and closely connected with this was his interpretation of the kingdom of God and its victory in this world, including the victory over disease and suffering. Cairns died in Edinburgh on 27 July 1946.<br>
