<span class="headword">Herbert,  Edward</span>, first Baron Herbert of Cherbury and first Baron Herbert of Castle Island  (1582?&#150;1648), <span class="occ">diplomat and philosopher</span>, the eldest son of Richard (<i>d</i>. 1596) and Magdalen Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1627) of Montgomery Castle, was born on 3 March, probably in 1582, at the home of his maternal grandparents, Sir Richard (<i>d</i>. 1570) and Lady Margaret Newport at Eyton-on-Severn, Shropshire, where he lived until he was nine.<h2>
<a name="Familyearlyyearsandmarriage"></a>Family, early years, and marriage</h2>Edward's grandfather Sir Edward Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1593), who served as member of parliament for Montgomeryshire in 1553 and 1556&#150;7, to a significant extent established the family fortune and was famed for his hospitality. Among the manors he acquired was that of Cherbury (or Chirbury), not far from Montgomery where he was constable of the castle. He was succeeded by Richard Herbert, who is said to have been handsome, brave, and accomplished in Latin and in history. Richard Herbert had been sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1576 and 1584 and, probably, member of parliament for the county in 1585&#150;6. His wife, Magdalen, was considered to be a lady of considerable virtue, charm, and piety who was esteemed by John Donne (with whom she developed a deep friendship, and who preached at her funeral) and Izaak Walton. In 1609 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7135/', "Sir John Danvers")</script>, who was much younger than she.<br>
<br>Edward Herbert had six younger brothers and three sisters. The brothers were Richard (<i>d</i>. 1622), a soldier who fought in the Low Countries; William, also a soldier who died young, having fought in both Denmark and the Low Countries; Charles (<i>d</i>. 1617), a fellow of New College, Oxford; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13025/', "George Herbert")</script>, poet and divine; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13029/', "Henry Herbert")</script>, a strong royalist who was appointed master of the revels by James I and who was knighted in 1623; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13048/', "Thomas Herbert")</script>, who served at sea with some distinction. His sisters were Elizabeth, who married Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais, Carmarthenshire; Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1623), whose marriage to John Vaughan of Llwydiarth marked the end of a prolonged conflict between their families; and, Frances, who married Sir John Brown of Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Edward Herbert had a sickly infancy, suffering from discharges from his ears, and it was a long time before he started to speak. He reports, however, that he understood what others were saying and only refrained from speaking out of fear of saying something impertinent or imperfect. He also alleges that one of his first questions was to enquire how he came to be in the world&#151;a question that caused some mirth among those looking after him. In 1591 he stayed nine months with Edward Thelwall of Plas-y-Ward in Denbighshire in order to learn Welsh, but gained little because he was ill all the time that he was there. When his health improved, he was sent to &#145;one Mr Newton at Diddlebury in Shropshire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 15) to learn Greek and logic, so as to make up what had been lost of his education because of his illness. His progress was such that in May 1596 he matriculated at University College, Oxford. A few months later he was called home by his mother because his father was seriously ill. After his father's death, he returned to his studies in Oxford. His relatives then arranged for him to wed Mary Herbert (1578?&#150;1634), one of his relatives, who was four years older than he and whose inheritance as the heir to her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13056/', "Sir William Herbert (d. 1593)")</script>, was on condition that she marry someone whose surname was Herbert. The wedding took place at Eyton on 28 February 1599, after which Herbert returned to Oxford with his wife and also his mother. The couple had two sons, <a href="#cosubject_13045">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Edward, and two daughters, Beatrice and Florence (who died in infancy). Herbert claims that he studied hard at the university, teaching himself French, Italian, Spanish, and music in order, as he puts it, &#145;to make my selfe a Citizen of the world as farr as it were possible&#146; and to avoid needing &#145;the company of younge men in whome I obserued &hellip; much ill example and deboist [debauchery]&#146;  (ibid., 17). He also developed his skills in riding and fencing.<br>
<br>In 1600 Herbert moved to London, but continued his studies. On presenting himself at court, the ageing Queen Elizabeth noticed him and, after being told who he was, remarked that &#145;It is pitty he was married soe young!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 37). He travelled to Burleigh House, Stamford, in April 1603 to meet the new king, James, who was on his way to London, and in July he was made a knight of the Bath. Herbert's autobiography professes that he took the chivalrous duties of knighthood very earnestly; although this was a time when honour was taken seriously, and while he was brave as well as gallant and very ready to take part in duels, there sometimes seems to be an underlying touch of wry comment in his descriptions of his involvement in such matters that perhaps reflects the sense of an older person recalling the more extravagant episodes in his youth. In 1605 Herbert's family persuaded him to move to Montgomery Castle to continue his studies, rather than accompany the earl of Nottingham's mission to Spain. That year he served as sheriff of Montgomeryshire and was elected member of parliament for the county; thereafter his name is regularly on the role of magistrates for the county. In 1607 James I gave Montgomery Castle to Philip Herbert, who had been made earl of Montgomery in 1605. Edward Herbert reacquired it from his cousin in July 1613 on paying &pound;500; in 1616 it was then granted to Sir William Herbert to administer on behalf of the crown, but once again Edward Herbert soon regained its possession.<h2>
<a name="Soldierandtraveller"></a>Soldier and traveller</h2>In 1608 Herbert went abroad with Aurelian Townsend. Through Sir George Carew, the English ambassador to the French court, he was introduced to French society. He developed a close acquaintance with Henri de Montmorency, the constable of France, and spent considerable time at his estates, where he rode and hunted. On his return to Paris he lodged with Isaac Casaubon. According to his autobiography he &#145;much benefited&#146; from &#145;learned Conversation&#146; with &#145;that Incomparable scholler&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 49), but he provides no information about the topics discussed. He also attended the court. In January 1610, after a stormy passage from Dieppe in which he was nearly shipwrecked, he returned to England. After spending some time in London at court and with his family, Herbert returned to the continent in late June with Grey Brydges, Lord Chandos, to take part in the siege of Juliers, where the English forces were commanded by Sir Edward Cecil. Here he behaved bravely, if sometimes foolhardily, and is claimed to have been the first to enter the town on its fall. During the siege a quarrel with Lord Howard of Walden (later the second earl of Suffolk) led to a challenge, but while Herbert was determined to fight a duel, he was prevented by the interventions of Sir Edward Cecil and later, in England, the matter was investigated by the privy council. On leaving Juliers he returned to England by way of D&uuml;sseldorf, along the Rhine to Antwerp, Brussels, and Calais.<br>
<br>In London, Herbert claims that he was &#145;in greate Esteeme both in Court and Citty&#146; and that people had copies of his portrait made  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 60). Sir John Ayres became jealous of his wife's interest in Herbert (although the latter says that &#145;litle more then common Civility ever past betwixt us&#146;  (ibid.)) and, aided by four others, attacked him. Herbert was stabbed but fought off his assailants. In February 1614 the register indicates that Herbert was admitted to Gray's Inn, but he does not seem to have thought this important. Later that year Herbert, with other English volunteers, joined the Dutch army under Maurice of Nassau that was involved in renewed conflict with Spanish forces. He was well received and on one occasion, outside Wezel, offered to accept a challenge from a Spanish officer to end the conflict by single combat. The Spanish commander, Spinola, forbade the duel; when Herbert went over to the Spanish camp to discover why, Spinola honoured Herbert at his table. On leaving him Herbert told Spinola that if the latter ever fought &#145;against the Infidels&#146;, he would join him.<br>
<br>Herbert then left the forces and travelled to Cologne and Heidelberg where he met the elector palatine and his wife, the daughter of James I. Travelling through Ulm and Augsburg, he visited the English ambassador at Venice before seeing the sights in Florence and Siena. When he arrived in Rome, he went to the English College and told the person who came to the door that he had not come &#145;to study Controversies but to see the Antiquityes of the Place&#146; and closed the conversation by remarking that he was not seeking a quarrel since,<blockquote>I conceived the Points agreed upon on both sides were greater Bonds of Amity betwixt us Then that the Points disagreed could break them, that for my part I loved euery body that was of a pious and vertuous life, and thought the Errors on what side soever, were more worthy Pitty then Hate. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 74)</blockquote>He does not record any reply being made to his theologically liberal sentiments, but reports that he spent about a month touring Rome. He describes Rome as the centre of first a political empire and then, later, of an even more powerful religious empire, since the power of absolution gave greater control over people than political force could ever achieve. He left Rome in some haste. Having gone to see &#145;the Pope in Consistory&#146;, he aroused the suspicion of the Inquisition by departing suddenly when the Pope was about &#145;to give his Blessing&#146;  (ibid., 75). Among the places that he then visited were Florence, where he was entertained by Sir Robert Dudley; Padua where he attended lectures, in particular by Cesare Cremonini; and Venice where the English ambassador, Sir Dudley Carleton, invited Herbert to accompany him to Turin. In Turin the duke of Savoy invited Herbert to serve him by going &#145;to Languidoc in France to conduct 4000 men of the reformed Religion &hellip; unto Piedmont&#146;, where they were to assist the duke in his war against the Spanish  (ibid., 77). After a hard and adventurous journey Herbert reached Lyons, where he was arrested by the governor. Although he did not behave tactfully in this situation (and eventually challenged the governor to a duel), he was soon released by the interventions of Sir Edward Sackville, who was visiting the town, and the duc de Montmorency. Continuing his travels, he stopped in Geneva before visiting the elector palatine and his wife in Heidelberg; he then moved on to the Low Countries, where he was favourably entertained by Maurice of Nassau. After several attempts to cross the channel, he made a difficult winter passage. Reaching London early in 1617, he fell ill with &#145;a Quartuan Ague&#146; from which he suffered &#145;without intermission&#146; for a year and a half, and then intermittently for another such period  (ibid., 87ff.). At those times that he was healthy, Herbert attended to his studies, got into scrapes (the privy council telling him after one episode that he should appreciate that his state of health was too poor for fighting), and developed friendships with John Donne, Ben Jonson, John Selden, and Thomas Carew. Five letters that he wrote in 1617&#150;18 to Sir Robert Harley about religion have survived. In them Herbert affirms that &#145;God's Church is all mankind&#146; and that &#145;God makes no man whom hee gives not means to come to him&#146; and to receive &#145;eternall Happines&#146; by loving him  (BL, Add. MS 70001). These liberal views were later to be developed in his works on philosophy and religion. The correspondence indicates that Harley was not happy with them.<h2>
<a name="Diplomacy"></a>Diplomacy</h2>In 1619 George Villiers, earl of Buckingham, was introduced to Herbert. Following this Herbert was appointed to be the English ambassador to France, which he did not expect; he reports that he thought he was in trouble again when the privy council summoned him to tell him of the appointment. Herbert left London on 13 May, the day on which Queen Anne was buried, and crossed the channel &#145;with a Train of an hundred and odd persons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 92), although without his wife, who refused to accompany him to France. His instructions were &#145;to renew the Oath of Alliance&#146; between the kings of England and of France  (ibid., 89) and to ensure peaceful relations between their countries. Setting himself up with some style in Paris, he soon showed himself to be an able but somewhat independently minded diplomat and succeeded in securing precedence at the French court over the Spanish ambassador. While in France he attempted to frustrate Spanish Habsburg plans, recommended to Buckingham a marriage between Prince Charles and Henrietta Maria of France, sought to aid protestants both in France and elsewhere, and supported the attempts of the elector palatine to hold the Bohemian throne. In the last of these matters especially, he went beyond the wishes of James I&#151;who, he comments, was &#145;that pacifike Prince all the world knew&#146;  (ibid., 102)&#151;for the king would not take action to help the elector palatine, although he was his son-in-law. Herbert as a result was reprimanded, but it should be noted that, as with other ambassadors of James I, he was handicapped by not receiving clear instructions from the king about English diplomatic policy. In 1621, however, he was told to try to prevent planned military attacks on French protestants. His endeavours led to a quarrel with the duc de Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII, and the threat of a duel. The French complained and Herbert was summoned back to England in July. De Luynes died in December and in February 1622 Herbert was sent back to France with no clearer general instructions than to use his own discretion as to what was best. To aid him in this he collected information from correspondents throughout western Europe. After the abortive attempt to marry Prince Charles to the Spanish infanta, Herbert was given the delicate task of seeking to arrange a marriage with the French princess, Henrietta Maria. Herbert's advice on the matter, however, offended both James I and the French; he was curtly recalled in a letter dated April 1624 and returned to England in July. His autobiography ends at this point. The crown failed to reimburse considerable debts that he had incurred during his time as ambassador, but sought in December to fob him off with the Irish barony of Castle Island, co. Kerry, and, in April 1629, with the English barony of Cherbury.<h2>
<a name="Philosophy"></a>Philosophy</h2>Before Herbert left Paris he had found time to complete and&#151;after gaining the approval of Grotius and Tielenus&#151;to have privately printed his major philosophical work, <span class="italic">De veritate, prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso</span> (&#145;On truth, in distinction from revelation, probability, possibility and error&#146;). An English translation of the work was eventually made by Meyrick H. Carr&eacute; (1937). The first edition of 1624 is dedicated to &#145;the whole human race&#146;, but the second edition of 1633 and final edition of 1645 are dedicated, perhaps less grandly, to &#145;every reader of sound and unprejudiced judgement&#146;. In this work Herbert attempts, sometimes in rather obscure Latin and with cloudy reasoning, to determine how people may and do identify what is true. Eschewing the appeal to supposed authorities, he maintains that the use of &#145;right reason&#146; (&#145;recta ratio&#146;) provides a reliable way between the errors of scepticism and bigotry. While, however, he presupposes that reason is the final arbiter of what is true, he is aware that people come to different judgements and so, paradoxically, holds that individuals should test their judgements against the standard of universal consent.<br>
<br>Herbert's epistemology is based on his doctrine of what he calls the &#145;faculties&#146; (&#145;facultates&#146;). According to this doctrine there is in each person a huge number of faculties, each of which corresponds to a distinguishable object, whether physical or intellectual. Truth is grasped when an object is perceived in terms of the pre-established faculty that conforms to it, and it is known to be so grasped by an inner sense of satisfaction. In this way Herbert presents what may be regarded as a common-sense view of truth that recognizes that the mind is not a passive tabula rasa on which objects make impressions but is active in knowing them. At the same time, contrary to Locke's criticism, he holds that what are innate are not actual propositions, but latent modes of thought that have to be actualized by appropriate experiences. Herbert also holds that among the intellectual objects latent in the faculties are certain &#145;common notions&#146; (&#145;notitiae communes&#146;). These are implanted by God in every person. When raised to consciousness through appropriate stimulation, they are recognized by all reasonable people to provide the normative principles for distinguishing what is true and good from what is false and bad.<br>
<br>Probably the most famous (and controversial) part of Herbert's thought is his application of his doctrine of common notions to religious belief. He maintains that the criterion for true belief and the authentic way to salvation are not given in alleged revelations, but in the five common notions of religion. These are that: God exists; God ought to be worshipped; the heart of religion is found in virtue joined with piety; evils must and can be expiated by means of repentance; and people face reward or punishment after this life. While, finally, Herbert allows that some truths may have been divinely revealed, he suggests stringent tests for authenticating supposed revelations and maintains that no alleged revelation can be from God if it contradicts (as opposed to reaffirming or adding to) what is established in the five common notions of religion. In spite, however, of his remarks about revelation, the last pages of his autobiography intriguingly report that he finally determined to have <span class="italic">De veritate</span> printed after receiving, in answer to prayer, what he interpreted as a divine sign to publish it.<br>
<br>In 1645 Herbert published a third, enlarged edition of <span class="italic">De veritate</span>, some copies of which included <span class="italic">De causis errorum: una cum tractatu de religione laici, et appendice ad sacerdotes; nec non quibusdam poematibus</span> (&#145;Concerning the causes of errors, with a treatise concerning religion for the laity, and an appendix to priests; with certain poems&#146;), a collection of writings that was also issued separately. The first of these pieces deals with fallacies that arise through failure to meet the appropriate conditions for perceiving the truth as laid down in <span class="italic">De veritate</span>. The second (an English translation of which was published by H. R. Hutcheson in New Haven in 1944) maintains that lay people can and should decide between rival systems of belief and avoid the errors introduced into religion by priestcraft. This is by applying the criterion of the common notions of religion that God has planted in the mind (&#145;in ipsa mente coelitus descriptae&#146;) to judge what is to be believed and practised. The religious significance of what the <span class="roman">Bible</span> reports is also to be determined by this criterion.<h2>
<a name="History"></a>History</h2>On returning to England in 1624 Herbert divided his time between London and Montgomeryshire. Although he was a member of the council of war and, as such, drew up proposals about a private militia for the king, he was without a significant official position. In an attempt to gain royal approval, he wrote two histories. The first, <span class="italic">Expeditio in Ream insulam</span> (&#145;The expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;&#146;), using notes made by Buckingham, was an attempt to vindicate Buckingham's conduct in leading the English forces sent to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in 1627 to aid the Huguenots in La Rochelle. Written in response to criticisms made in French pamphlets, particularly one by Jacques Isnard, Herbert's defence of Buckingham was not very successful&#151;but the mission was such a fiasco that it is impossible to envisage how he could have succeeded. The Latin manuscript, dedicated to Charles I and dated 10 August 1630, was not published until 1656. The major response that it gained from the king was a request to write a history of Henry VIII. Consequently, following the death of his wife in October 1634, Herbert began work on <span class="italic">The Life and Raigne of King Henry the Eighth</span>. In writing it he made use of materials in official archives and in the Cotton Library, which had been closed to the public since 1629. To help his researches, in which he was assisted by Thomas Master of New College, Oxford, Herbert was provided with apartments in Hampton Court Palace. In a petition in January 1635 he asked permission to move to Whitehall or St James's in order to be more conveniently placed to use the records in the former and the library in the latter. As a good historian he was prepared to contrast what was widely said to have happened with what is stated in the documents, but on occasion he was also prepared to insert remarks that give voice to his own point of view&#151;as when, in reporting a debate of the House of Commons in 1529, he interpolates a speech advocating the canon of the &#145;Common, Authentick, and universal Truths&#146; that are recognized throughout humankind due to the benevolent providence of God. While the work was completed in 1639, it was not published until 1649. Although it too failed to gain any significant mark of royal approval, it was long regarded as a standard, authoritative study of the reign.<br>
<br>In another fruitless effort to win royal favour, Herbert had in March 1635 submitted to Charles I a paper on royal supremacy in which he argued that the king should be the sole head of the church. In sending the paper to Laud, the king did not help Herbert's relationship with the archbishop, with whom he had previously enjoyed good relations. A little later that year the papal envoy, Panzani, reported to the pope that conversations with Herbert indicated that he was not hostile to the Church of Rome and that he was prepared to submit his <span class="italic">De veritate</span> to papal criticism. It is not improbable, however, that the report may reflect a misunderstanding of a combination of Herbert's desire for appreciation with his conviction that all sensible people, even the pope, would acknowledge the yardstick of the five common notions of religion.<h2>
<a name="Civilwarandfinalyears"></a>Civil war and final years</h2>As a member of the council of war, Herbert was summoned in 1639 to attend the king at York in connection with the expedition against the Scots. After initially drawing attention to his grievances over failure to pay debts that he had incurred in serving the crown, he eventually joined the court, accompanied by his younger brother, Henry. At Alnwick he wrote a poem, &#145;The Idea&#146;, whose musings on the contrast between Platonic perfections and earthly reality suggest that his mind was not focused on the threatened conflict. Returning to London at the end of the year, he took up his intellectual pursuits, in particular on the question of the &#145;religio laici&#146; (&#145;religion for the laity&#146;) and on <span class="italic">De causis errorum</span> (&#145;Concerning the cause of errors&#146;). In March 1640, however, he wrote to F. Liceti that he did not expect to be able to finish the latter because of the noise of warfare. In April he took his seat in the House of Lords and in September joined the king at York where, on 6 October, he spoke in the council against making a treaty with the Scots, who had now invaded England. His advice rejected, Herbert, whose health was not good, retired to Montgomery Castle. In 1641 he was in London and was one of the peers who voted for the bill of attainder against Strafford. During May the following year, however, he was committed to the Tower of London by the Commons for suggesting that the king should only be held to have broken his coronation oath if he made war on parliament &#145;without cause&#146;. He was released after apologizing and he retired again to his studies in Montgomery. From then on, although his sons were active in the royalist forces, he himself attempted so far as was possible to avoid being involved in the civil war. Pleading ill health he declined to join the king at Oxford and, on two occasions in 1644, he declined to join Prince Rupert at Shrewsbury. He also told the prince that the presence of his son's troops at Montgomery meant that there was no need to send more soldiers to garrison the castle. On 3 September Sir Thomas Middleton's parliamentary force reached Montgomery and summoned Herbert to surrender the castle. In February 1644 parliament had resolved on the confiscation and sale of Herbert's property in London, but officials postponed the sale of his valuable library in London that was planned for 30 August to learn what Herbert would do about surrendering the castle. Herbert, who was accompanied in the castle by his daughter Beatrice, was unwell, in no mood to fight, and valued his books. He surrendered the castle, having had a sentence included in the articles of agreement laying down that none of the occupying troops should &#145;enter into the library or study of the said Edward Lord Herbert, or the two next roomes or chambers adjoyning to the said study or library&#146; (the text of the articles of surrender, printed in <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 284&#150;6n.). As a result, parliament's threat to his property was then lifted.<br>
<br>Having watched a royalist attempt to capture Montgomery Castle being fought off, Herbert moved to London. He affirmed his allegiance to parliament and on 2 November petitioned for financial support. In February 1645 he was granted &pound;20 per week and no restrictions were placed upon his liberty. He primarily devoted himself to his studies, although in October 1646 he was appointed steward of the duchy of Cornwall and warden of the stannaries. In March 1647 he was permitted to appoint a governor for Montgomery Castle but a few weeks later, on 12 May, he was summoned to the House of Lords to explain why his governor had not resisted a royalist assault. During the autumn he visited Gassendi in Paris and may have gone to Holland to meet Gerard Vos (Gerardus Vossius) and his son Isaak, who had offered to have Herbert's <span class="italic">De religione gentilium</span> published in Holland. On 9 November he was fined for absenting himself from the House of Lords, but he pleaded ill health and the fine was remitted. Continuing to be troubled by money matters, on 4 May 1648 he reminded parliament that his pension was much in arrears. His health was now poor and on 1 August he made his will, designating his grandson Edward (the son of his elder son, Richard) as the main beneficiary of his unencumbered possessions, while leaving his numerous books in Latin and Greek to Jesus College, Oxford. According to John Aubrey's <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, on his deathbed Herbert asked his old friend James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, to bring him the sacrament but then added, in typically robust fashion, that it would do him no harm even if it did not do him any good. Ussher was offended and refused. Herbert died on 20 August 1648 (according to his monument but the date has been queried since the burial register and the <span class="italic">Calendar of State Papers Domestic, 1648&#150;1649</span> give the date as 5 August: see Evelyn Rogers, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, new ser., 28, 1981, 524). He was buried, as he directed, &#145;without pomp or other ceremony than is usual&#146; and without &#145;shew of mourning&#146; at midnight in St Giles-in-the-Fields, London.<h2>
<a name="Posthumouspublicationsandreputation"></a>Posthumous publications and reputation</h2>At his death Herbert left several unpublished manuscripts. The <span class="italic">Expeditio in Ream insulam</span> and <span class="italic">The Life and Raigne of King Henry the Eighth</span> have already been mentioned. His <span class="italic">De religione gentilium</span> was published in 1663, when Isaak Vos saw it through the press in Amsterdam. An English translation by William Lewis (<span class="italic">The Antient Religion of the Gentiles and Causes of their Errors Consider'd</span>) was printed in 1705. In this work Herbert attempts to show that the evidence of actual religions, which he takes mainly from classical authors, confirms his thesis that the five common notions of religion are universally acknowledged. Data that seem to contradict this thesis are dismissed as arising either from priestly corruptions or from a failure to recognize symbolic usage. He ends the treatise by submitting it to the &#145;Judgement of the <i>Catholick</i> and <i>Orthodox</i> Church; but not to the impetuous Enemies of Universal Divine Providence and the Publick Peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Antient Religion</span>, 388). In 1768 W. Bathoe published <span class="italic">A Dialogue between a Tutor and his Pupil</span>. Although there are some doubters, and although the manuscript evidence indicates that the printed version needs editorial revision, this text as a whole is generally considered to be correctly ascribed to Herbert. In it he develops the thesis advanced in <span class="italic">De religione gentilium</span> by paying particular attention to the recognition of the third and fourth common notions of religion (virtue as piety, and expiation by means of repentance) in all faiths. Priestly corruptions are again denounced. The work stops before the fifth common notion (post-mortem judgment) is discussed. Four years earlier <span class="italic">The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury Written by Himself</span> had been published with a dedication and introduction by Horace Walpole. Again there are problems with the original published text, and a revised edition by J. M. Shuttleworth was published by Oxford University Press in 1976. In it, in a lively and somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion, Herbert tells the story of his life and ideas up to the time of his recall from France in 1624. In the course of his story he throws light on his views on such matters as duelling and education, herbal remedies and religion. A continuation of the life, but in a properly sober, academic manner, was provided by Sidney Lee in a usefully annotated edition of the autobiography published in 1886. An edition of Herbert's poems in English and in Latin (but not including the three that appeared in 1645) was published by Sir Henry Herbert, his brother, in 1665. While the poems show the influence of John Donne and Giambattista Marino, the later ones in particular show qualities that suggest that Herbert may be considered to be an unwarrantably neglected poet.<br>
<br>Finally, a comment needs to be made about Herbert's reputation as a &#145;deist&#146; and &#145;the father of deism in England&#146;. The latter ascription has been so long and so commonly made that it has become almost a second title for Herbert. Its justification is, however, open to question. On the one hand, it is not clear that&#151;apart from being one of the sources used by Charles Blount (an eclectic and at times plagiarizing writer)&#151;Herbert's views had any notable influence on those later writers commonly called deists, itself an unclear designation of doubtful value. On the other hand, Herbert's own statements indicate that he is to be regarded as a theologian of liberal convictions who sought to establish a rationally warranted understanding of religious belief that avoided the pitfalls of scepticism and bigotry; properly acknowledged the actuality of God as a universal providence whose gracious activity influences the lives of individuals; recognized that divine salvation is available to all humankind through repentance; affirmed the efficacy of prayer and the reality of personal immortality; was suspicious of the pretensions of priestcraft; and sought through the common notions to identify ways by which any reasonable person can justifiably choose between the competing claims of rival systems of faith. Herbert claimed to be an independent thinker and, although he was more of a provocative gentleman thinker than a rigorous scholar, he deserves to be respected as such&#151;and, so far as modern English (or perhaps it should be said Anglo-Welsh) writers are concerned, as one who presented in <span class="italic">De veritate</span> the first metaphysical treatise and in <span class="italic">De religione gentilium</span> the first study of comparative religion.<br>

<a name="cosubject_13045"></a><span class="headword">Richard Herbert</span>, second Baron Herbert of Cherbury and second Baron Herbert of Castle Island  (1600?&#150;1655), the elder son of Edward Herbert, was <span class="occ">a magistrate</span> in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, in 1634 and was involved in relieving the poor there during an attack of the plague. He married Lady Mary, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8587/', "John Egerton, the first earl of Bridgewater")</script>, in November 1627. They had four sons, <a href="#cosubject_13022">Edward Herbert [<i>see below</i>]</a>, John (who died young), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13030/', "Henry Herbert")</script>, and Thomas, and four daughters, Frances, Florence (or Florentia), Arabella, and Alicia. Like his younger brother, Henry, Richard had somewhat extravagant tastes for his means. Correspondence from December 1635 and January 1636 concerns a quarrel with his father about his debts. In 1639 he commanded a troop of horse in the expedition against the Scots, while on the outbreak of the civil war he was commissioned in September 1642 to raise a regiment of foot and was appointed governor of Bridgnorth. In the following month he received a commission to be captain of a troop of horse; when the queen landed from Holland at Bridlington, Yorkshire, in 1643, he accompanied her to the court at Oxford. Later, in September, he was made governor of Ludlow. Attending the assembly of royalist members of the houses of parliament at Oxford in 1644, he signed the letter that was sent to the earl of Essex, the parliamentary general, seeking an end to the conflict. In that same year he was with Prince Rupert at Shrewsbury and was made governor of Aberystwyth Castle. On the death of his father in August 1648 he succeeded to the title and was bequeathed his father's horses while his wife received his father's viols and lutes. Having been active on the royalist side in the civil war, parliament imposed on Herbert a large fine. It also required him to demolish Montgomery Castle while permitting him to keep whatever he could realize from its materials. He died on 13 May 1655 and was buried in the church at Montgomery. His son <a name="cosubject_13022"></a><span class="headword">Edward Herbert</span>, third Baron Herbert of Cherbury and third Baron Herbert of Castle Island  (1630&#150;1678), was born in February or March 1630, the favourite grandchild of the first Baron Herbert of Cherbury. According to the latter's will, money in a trunk and plate in his house in London were to be used for his grandson's education at university or in overseas travel. He was also left the contents of Montgomery Castle with the instruction that he was not to sell, or even to lend, the books and furniture there, and only to allow his father use of them on his giving good surety for their return &#145;with safety and without diminution&#146;. Like his father and uncle he supported the royalist side throughout the civil war and he was imprisoned for a short time after joining Sir George Booth, Lord Delamere, in declaring for Charles II in Cheshire in 1659. He married first Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Middleton (who had captured Montgomery Castle from his grandfather), and then Elizabeth Brydges, daughter of Lord Chandos, a granddaughter of his grandfather's friend. There were no children from either marriage. After the Restoration he was appointed <span class="occ">custos rotulorum</span> for Montgomeryshire in 1660 and for Denbighshire in 1666. In 1663 he built a house near the site of the former Montgomery Castle. Richard Davies, a Quaker from Welshpool, often interceded with Edward Herbert on behalf of imprisoned Quakers and was treated with consideration. Edward himself complained that his great-uncle, Sir Henry Herbert, with whom he corresponded, did not respect him properly, although it should also be noted that when in 1665 Sir Henry published a collection of the first Lord Herbert of Cherbury's poems, he dedicated them to Edward. Edward Herbert died on 9 December 1678 and was buried in St Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey.<br>
