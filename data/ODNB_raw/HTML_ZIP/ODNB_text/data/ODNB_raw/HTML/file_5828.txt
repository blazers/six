</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coke, Sir  John</span>  (1563&#150;1644), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 5 March 1563 in London, the fourth of eleven children born to Richard Coke (<i>d</i>. 1582) of Trusley, near Derby, and his wife, Mary Sacheverell (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter and heir of Thomas Sacheverell of Nottinghamshire.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>As a youth Coke may have attended Westminster School. He matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1576, received a scholarship there beginning in 1580, and earned his BA in 1581 and MA in 1584. He remained at Cambridge as a fellow of Trinity until 1591. During this time he apparently was a lecturer in rhetoric. Thomas Fuller wrote that Coke &#145;being chosen rhetoric lecturer in the university, grew eminent for his ingenious and critical readings&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.371). These years at Cambridge left an indelible impression on Coke. &#145;I was not bred in servile or illiberal trades; the university was my nurse&#146;, he later wrote  (Coke to the marquess of Buckingham, 12 Oct 1622, Coke MSS). In particular he acquired a passion for order and a civic humanist's sense of duty to the public good. He also became loosely acquainted with the earl of Essex's circle, especially the literary figure and courtier named Sir Fulke Greville, who proved a lasting friend and patron. Coke needed a patron because his older brother Francis had inherited the family lands, leaving him only a small annuity of less than &pound;7. When he left Cambridge, he worked as an auditor or accountant for Greville's estate, and from 1593 to 1597 he travelled on the continent.<h2>
<a name="Earlynavalcareerandforcedretirement"></a>Early naval career and forced retirement</h2>Coke's first major employment by the crown lasted from 1599 to 1604 as deputy treasurer of the navy, working under Greville who was treasurer during those years. Together the two men battled against the gross corruption, thievery, and disorder that flourished in the navy under Lord Admiral Nottingham. In this effort, Greville told Coke, &#145;we will perish or prosper together&#146;  (Greville to Coke, <i>c</i>.1600, Coke MSS). They did not prosper for long. They had the misfortune of advocating an ambitious plan for naval reform at precisely the time Queen Elizabeth, Greville's sole patron, died. This left them perilously exposed to their enemies when James VI and I came to the throne. Nottingham succeeded in removing Greville from office, replacing him with the more compliant Sir Robert Mansell.<br>
<br>Forced into early retirement and exiled from the court, Coke spent the years 1604 to 1618 continuing to help manage Greville's personal estate and to build one of his own. Some time during 1604 he married Marie Powell (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of John Powell of Preston, Herefordshire, another one of Greville's employees. During the first years of their marriage they lived with Marie's parents while Coke continued to travel in connection with Greville's business affairs. The letters Coke and his wife exchanged reveal that they were very much in love, although he was torn between continuing to hope for a revival of his career or settling down in the countryside. About 1607 he chose the latter course; in 1608 he and Marie built a new home for themselves near her parents in Herefordshire. They named it Hall Court and lived there happily for a decade. In the course of time they had six children who survived infancy (Joseph, John junior, Thomas, Mary, Elizabeth, and Anne). Coke monitored events at court from a distance, looking for signs of change in his favour. In 1614 Greville made a surprising return to office as chancellor of the exchequer, and in 1618 another old friend, Sir Robert Naunton, was appointed secretary of state. At first Coke resisted their invitations, but eventually they succeeded in luring him back to court. &#145;I pray God from my heart&#146;, he wrote, &#145;I may not move from my retreat except it be for a better account of my life&#146;  (Coke to Naunton, early 1618, Coke MSS).<h2>
<a name="Navalcommissionerandmasterofrequests"></a>Naval commissioner and master of requests</h2>Coke returned to royal service in June 1618 when Lionel Cranfield, supported by the marquess of Buckingham, was reforming various departments of government, and was appointed to a commission responsible for investigating the state of the navy. This gave him a remarkable opportunity to pick up where he had left off fourteen years earlier, and he certainly made the most of it. Owing to his prior experience, knowledge of the navy, organizational ability, and zeal for reform, he quickly became the leading member of the commission and authored its report. Nottingham and Mansell were persuaded to step aside and Buckingham took the office of lord admiral, although he quickly delegated the actual daily administration of the navy to the commissioners. On 12 February 1619 the naval commission was converted from an investigative body into a board of governors with authority to implement their own proposals for reform. In less than a year Coke had managed a remarkable political comeback and turned the tables on his old enemies. By virtue of the trust that Buckingham put in him and his dominance of the commission, he was now the chief administrator of the English navy. He has justly been called &#145;the Samuel Pepys of his day&#146;  (Lockyer, 76).<br>
<br>Coke aimed higher, however. On 8 November 1621 he received a royal grant of &pound;300 per annum for his services in the navy, but this did not wholly satisfy him. What he really wanted was the security of an office at court, and he continued to press Buckingham to find one for him. Buckingham eventually arranged for him to be appointed a master of requests and he took his oath on 20 November 1622. The following July he triumphantly moved his family to London. Triumph soon turned to tragedy, however. At the beginning of 1624 his oldest son, Joseph, died of spotted fever. A few months later his wife, Marie, died, shortly after giving birth to twins who barely outlived her. In late 1624 Coke, left with the responsibility of five children to care for, married again. His second wife was Joan Gore (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lee), daughter of a former lord mayor of London, Sir Robert Lee, and widow of a former alderman, William Gore. Coke and his second wife had an amicable relationship, but it was essentially a marriage of convenience.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentsandwarinthe1620s"></a>Parliaments and war in the 1620s</h2>Coke sat in all the parliaments of the 1620s. In 1621, when he sat for the borough of Warwick, presumably through Greville's influence, there is little evidence of his participation. In 1624, owing to the influence of his brother-in-law, Valentine Carey, bishop of Exeter, he sat for the borough of St Germans; he was knighted on 9 September that year. He was still a minor figure but enthusiastically supported the call for war. Like many others who came of age at the time of the Spanish Armada, he hated Roman Catholicism and wanted to resume the Elizabethan war against Spain. Unfortunately the harsh realities of renewed warfare made life infinitely more difficult for Coke. To him fell the task of preparing the war fleets, explaining their failures, and imploring parliament for money. He was involved in numerous employments: he oversaw preparation of the fleet that sailed to Cadiz; he was instrumental in extorting money from the East India Company; and he was involved in frantic efforts to ensure that English ships lent to the French government would not be used against the French protestants then in rebellion.<br>
<br>In 1625, in the first parliament of King Charles I's reign, Coke, again sitting for St Germans, was a much more visible participant. Both Buckingham and Charles employed him to make the case for further supply. He laid out the financial needs of the government in painstaking detail, but his pleas met with a hostile reception, especially from two personal enemies in the Commons, Sir Robert Mansell and Sir John Eliot. Eliot's animus towards Coke is evident in his account of these years entitled <span class="italic">Negotium posterorum</span>. Coke's speech on 4 August 1625 was especially controversial. The king chose him at the very last minute to address both houses of parliament and instructed him to ask again for money. Some objected simply to the fact that, as a mere commoner, he had been employed to deliver the king's pleasure to both houses. Coke had not coveted this dubious honour: &#145;For my part&#146;, he wrote to Greville, &#145;I neither had ambition nor thought of speaking in that place&#146;  (Coke to Greville, 4 Aug 1625, Coke MSS).<br>
<br>In September 1625 Buckingham arranged for Coke to be appointed one of the king's two principal secretaries of state. The senior secretary, Sir Edward Conway, retained fairly exclusive control over foreign affairs, but Coke had a great many additional responsibilities in the domestic realm now added to his continuing burden in the navy. He was particularly zealous in using prize goods or contraband to finance the war effort.<br>
<br>In the parliament of 1626 Coke, sitting now for Cambridge University, was again prominent in trying to defend the lord admiral and rally support for the war. He was very much on the defensive because he was deeply involved in many of the affairs complained of in this parliament, some of which became articles of impeachment against Buckingham. Coke and his old nemesis, Mansell, sparred over the role of the council of war, the controversial ships lent to the French, and the failure to protect the seas and coastlines from pirates. Coke was also employed again to ask for further supply. He now estimated that the war effort required &pound;1,067,221.<br>
<br>When Charles dissolved parliament, resorted to a forced loan to raise money, and imprisoned resisters, there is reason to believe that Coke was one of the more moderate members of the privy council who was uncomfortable with this approach. This suspicion is reinforced by his performance in the parliament of 1628&#150;9, where he again sat for Cambridge University. There were only three privy councillors in the Commons in 1628, and he was by far the most active. Though his performance has sometimes been judged harshly, his position as an intermediary between the king and Commons was a difficult one, especially given the constant sniping by Eliot. Coke took painstaking care not to offend. &#145;My desire&#146;, he declared, &#145;is not to stir but to quiet, not to provoke but to appease&#146;  (Johnson and others, 2.65). He admitted that illegal courses had been taken, and he actually encouraged passage of the petition of right. His performance was not flawless but generally speaking his conciliatory approach made the best of a bad situation.<br>
<br>Coke's participation in the parliament of 1628 was cut short when he was dispatched to Portsmouth to prepare another fleet in mid-May. He kept a detailed journal of his work at Portsmouth which illuminates the reasons why the navy performed so badly in these years. He had to contend with a chaotic situation, inexperienced commanders, rotten victuals, mutinous seamen, a chronic shortage of money, and resurgent corruption. One night someone even tried to shoot him. Of course Buckingham fared worse. When he was stabbed to death at Portsmouth on 25 August 1628, Coke interrogated the assassin.<h2>
<a name="Thepersonalruleofthe1630s"></a>The personal rule of the 1630s</h2>During Charles I's personal rule of the 1630s Coke undertook an enormous amount of work, as indicated by the many state papers, both foreign and domestic, which are in his hand: he was a member of all the standing committees of the privy council; he served on commissions to reform the wardrobe and ordnance office, though both reforms were thwarted; he played a major role in the successful reform of the postal system; and he continued to take great interest in the navy, though he had less authority over it than before. His passion for administrative efficiency made him a natural ally of Archbishop Laud and Thomas Wentworth, later earl of Strafford. Wentworth praised Coke for his integrity, arranged for him to receive a grant of Irish land, and vowed, &#145;I shall honour you all the Days of my Life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafforde's Letters and Dispatches</span>, 1.494).<br>
<br>As one of two principal secretaries of state Coke had worked harmoniously with two partners (Conway and Sir Dudley Carleton), but the appointment of Sir Francis Windebank in June 1632 initiated a debilitating rivalry that lasted throughout the decade. This rivalry is particularly evident in the conduct of foreign affairs where there was an unhealthy competition between the secretaries, for which King Charles must bear part of the blame.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1636 Coke gave a speech at Oxford University which is the best expression of his political views  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 5.1.126&#150;32). Not surprisingly he took a hierarchical view of society and an absolutist view of the monarchy, yet these were tempered by his lifelong devotion to the public good and the rule of law. His views on matters such as swearing and drinking could be described as puritanical. His religious views were presumably similar to those of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5827/', "George Coke (1570&#150;1646)")</script>, bishop of Bristol and of Hereford: he was a firm anti-Catholic protestant and a prudent conformist, uneasy with all forms of separation and zealotry.<br>
<br>As Coke grew older others enviously eyed his office, particularly Robert Sidney, earl of Leicester, and Sir Henry Vane, who enlisted the support of Queen Henrietta Maria. By 1638 age was also taking its toll on Coke; he managed to accompany King Charles to Berwick in 1639 during the first bishops' war, but on 10 January 1640 Charles requested his resignation. He resisted, and Strafford strenuously supported him, but to no avail. On 31 January Coke surrendered the seals of office. Charles acted under pressure from the queen, but it was equally clear that Coke, at the age of seventy-six, was no longer able to discharge the duties of his office, especially given the prospect of renewed fighting in Scotland and the meeting of a new parliament.<br>
<br>Coke could well afford to retire. In 1628 he had sold Hall Court for &pound;3000, and between 1626 and 1634 he purchased land in Derbyshire and Leicestershire costing at least &pound;20,000. By the mid-1630s his annual income was approximately &pound;3500 (&pound;2000 from the secretaryship and &pound;1500 from rents). Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, wrote of him: &#145;His cardinal perfection was industry, and his most eminent infirmity covetousness&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.81). The centrepiece of his estate was Melbourne Hall, a manor in Derbyshire not far from his ancestral home of Trusley and it was to Melbourne that he retired in 1640.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>Coke's retirement was far from peaceful. Following the outbreak of civil war in 1642 his property was destroyed, his home was invaded, and he was repeatedly harassed. His own family was divided because his oldest son, John, an MP for Derbyshire, sided with parliament, and his younger son, Thomas, an MP for Leicester, took the king's side. His own position is ambiguous; it has been described as neutralist or parliamentarian. It is true that he grew estranged from his royalist son, and he twice wrote expressions of support for parliament, declaring that &#145;my heart is faithful and my prayers assiduous for the prosperity of the Parliament, wherein consisteth the welfare of this church and state&#146;  (Coke to the earl of Essex, 20 Sept 1642, Coke MSS), but these poses could have been dictated more by expediency than conviction. Perhaps more revealing was a letter he wrote recounting his lifetime of tireless efforts at administrative reform under three different monarchs. &#145;Now by all these and such other employments&#146;, he concluded, &#145;I have been taught that which the Archbishop of Canterbury said often: that kings cannot be served against their wills&#146;  (Coke to John Coke, late 1640, Coke MSS).<br>
<br>Coke was eventually forced to leave Melbourne and take refuge in his wife's home at Tottenham. There he died on 8 September 1644. Perhaps owing to the confusion of the civil war, his will could not be found after his death, and his place of burial is unknown. His wife survived him.<h2>
<a name="Historicalappraisal"></a>Historical appraisal</h2>Coke has sometimes been considered terribly hardworking but mediocre, being described as one of Charles I's &#145;more humdrum&#146; ministers  (Aylmer, 234). He was certainly exceptionally industrious but it is possible to regard the quality of his work, especially in the navy, more favourably. The embittered opinion of Sir John Eliot should not be accepted at face value. Compared to a man like Eliot, Coke lacked charisma and passion, but he had his own solid qualities of character. A dedicated and honourable man, he was an unusually able administrator, and if he had not possessed finer qualities of mind, he would not have enjoyed the friendship and admiration of Sir Fulke Greville.<br>
<br>Coke achieved high office, played a major role in the political life of the nation, and grew rich. Yet measured by other standards, his life was a failure. He professed to believe that a public office was &#145;a stage to do good&#146;, and he vowed not to &#145;dispose of my life for wages&#146;. But in the end, what good had he achieved and what did he have to show for his work except wages?  (Young, 62, 98, 275). There was no lasting achievement. Even reform of the navy, his chief accomplishment, was wrecked by the very war that he himself had eagerly advocated.<br>
<br>Coke has been criticized most severely for his apparent toadyism. To the modern eye his deferential demeanour may look like crass servility, but it was a function of his conservative nature and an absolute necessity for survival at court. Moreover, his final evaluation of his own career is hardly servile. As noted above, he himself concluded that the lesson of his whole life's work amounted to this: &#145;that kings cannot be served against their wills&#146;.<br>
