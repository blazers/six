<span class="headword">Young,  James</span>  (1717&#150;1789), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 15 November 1717 and baptized on 29 November 1717 at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster, one of four sons of William Young (<i>b</i>. 1687) of Plymouth, Devon, and his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker. The naval surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30225/', "James Yonge (1647&#150;1721)")</script> was his great-uncle. He began his active naval career in the Mediterranean in 1737 as a midshipman on the <i>Gloucester</i>. He was promoted lieutenant on 9 March 1739, and became commander of the <i>Salamander</i> in 1742. On 16 May 1743 he was posted captain of the <i>Namur</i>; shortly afterwards he was in the <i>Kennington</i>. He then moved to the <i>Dunkirk</i>, and remained in the Mediterranean until the peace in 1748. He married his first wife, Elizabeth Bolton, in Gibraltar in 1747; they had four daughters, Philippa, Susan, Elizabeth, and Sophia, and one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30285/', "William Young (1751&#150;1821)")</script>, later himself a senior naval officer. In 1752 he was appointed to the <i>Jason</i> and in 1755 to the <i>Newark</i>, from which he moved in October to the <i>Intrepid</i>, which went out to the Mediterranean in spring 1756 in the squadron commanded by Admiral John Byng. At the battle of Minorca on 20 May 1756 the <i>Intrepid</i> was the last ship of the van division, and in approaching the enemy had her foretopmast shot away. Byng afterwards asserted that this event caused the disorder in the rear division of his fleet, but Young, when examined at Byng's court martial, denied such a result and was supported by other evidence.<br>
<br>In 1757 Young commanded the <i>Burford</i> in the expedition against Rochefort. In 1759 he was captain of the <i>Mars</i> and on 20 November he flew a commodore's broad pennant in her at the battle of Quiberon Bay. In the following years he commanded small squadrons in the channel, and on 21 October 1762 he was promoted rear-admiral. His first wife having died, at the end of 1762 (the marriage settlement was dated 18 November 1762) he married Sophia, daughter of John Henry Vasmer, merchant; they had two children, James (<i>b</i>. 1762), who became rear-admiral of the blue, and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1813). He may have had a further son outside marriage, Thomas (1758&#150;1795). On 28 October 1770 Young was made vice-admiral, and in April 1775 he was appointed commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station, with his flag in the <i>Portland</i>.<br>
<br>Young's period of command in the West Indies covered the early years of the American War of Independence, and his small squadron had two main tasks: to cut off the supply of arms and gunpowder to the American rebels, and to protect British trade from attack by American privateers and warships. Young was more successful in the latter task than the former. His efforts to halt the supply of munitions to the Americans were hampered by a lack of fast-sailing cruisers in his squadron and the open assistance given to the Americans by the neutral islands, especially the Dutch at St Eustatius and the French at Martinique. With regard to trade protection, Young had organized a convoy system from the islands to Britain by mid-1776 and his ships had some success against American privateers and warships. In November 1776 an American warship arriving at St Eustatius received the first foreign salute to the flag of the new United States. In retaliation Young imposed a virtual blockade of the neutral Dutch island until he received orders to lift it in early 1777. During Young's command his squadron captured 205 American merchant ships and captured or destroyed seventeen American privateers and warships.<br>
<br>On 29 January 1778 Young was promoted admiral of the white; his flag was recorded on the <i>Aurora</i> by Bartholomew James at Antigua on 5 February. In July he returned to England. He saw no further service and lived in London, dying there on 24 January 1789. He was buried at St Anne's, Soho, on 2 February 1789.<br>
