<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nolan,  Michael Patrick</span>, Baron Nolan  (1928&#150;2007), <span class="occ">judge</span> and first chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, was born on 10 September 1928 at 2 Woodside Avenue, North Finchley, Middlesex, the younger son and youngest of three children of James Thomas Nolan (1895&#150;1955), motor engineer, later estate agent, and his wife, Jane Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walsh (1894&#150;1954). His siblings were Elizabeth 
    (Betty; 1923&#150;1940)
   and James 
    (Jim; 1925&#150;2001)
  . The branch of the Nolan family from which he was descended had been living in co. Kerry, Ireland, until they were driven out by the potato famine of the mid-nineteenth century. His grandfather took the family to England.<h2>
<a name="Educationnationalserviceandearlycareer"></a>Education, national service, and early career</h2>Michael Nolan was brought up first in North Finchley and then at Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, where his parents went to live to look after his father's ailing parents in the mid-1930s. Nolan regarded his own parents, who were devout Roman Catholics, as the first and foremost influences on his life. By 1940 the family was back in their North Finchley home. He was educated at Ampleforth College. When he was studying there for the higher certificate his main subjects were Latin, Greek, and ancient history, with German and Spanish as further options. One other discipline he learned there from one of the monks was the art of fly-fishing. The passion for this remained with him throughout his life. It seems legitimate to infer that his devotion to the Roman Catholic faith was also firmly settled by the time he left school. This gave him the unshakeable personal integrity that was such a prominent feature of his adult character. He later said that although the teaching at Ampleforth was excellent, the most important things he learned there were self-confidence and the proper use of authority. Ampleforth with its wide Yorkshire landscape filled the gaps created by earlier years spent in towns and cities. He enjoyed Yorkshire village cricket as the captain of a school team called the Optimists and excelled at rifle shooting.<br>
<br>After Ampleforth Nolan spent his two years' national service in the army (1947&#150;9), ending with a commission in the Royal Artillery and duties in Germany. (His first preference had been the Irish Guards, but on interview the regimental colonel told him that there were vacancies only for those seeking a regular commission; his second choice, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, also never became a possibility.) He maintained his military links after national service with some six years of service in the Territorial Army (1949&#150;55). Meanwhile in 1949 he went to Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner. The original intention had been that he would read Greats under the watchful eye of Sir Maurice Bowra, the distinguished classical scholar who was warden of the college. But Greats took four years and Nolan was by then more attracted by a three-year course. It seems that the suggestion that he should select law as his subject came from his Ampleforth headmaster, Paul Nevill. Whatever the source of this selection it undoubtedly suited Nolan admirably, both intellectually and temperamentally. In his first term at Wadham, Peter Carter became the law tutor of the college. He had won the Croix de Guerre (with silver star) in Normandy, and subsequently developed a great reputation as a legal scholar and teacher. (He became an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple in 1981 and an honorary QC in 1990, no doubt with Nolan's backing.) Nolan graduated with a second in jurisprudence in 1952.<br>
<br>After graduating Nolan went as a pupil into the chambers of Melford Stevenson (later a High Court judge). His pupil-master was Alan Orr (later a High Court judge and thereafter a lord justice of appeal). He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1953. On 9 April the same year he married Margaret Mary Noyes (<i>b</i>. 1932), the younger daughter of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35266/', "Alfred Noyes")</script> and his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayne. In his uncompleted memoirs he related how he had gone to a ball without a partner. He was asked to look after a girl whose partner was smitten by flu and had to go home early. Nolan was not very pleased with the idea of looking after an unknown girl, his preference being to be a free agent.<blockquote>But then I saw Margaret, smiling at me across the room. As she will be the first to confirm, I have no gift at all for romantic words, in speech or in writing, so I simply state as a fact that I knew at once that I had found the love of my life. Margaret has the most beautiful smile in the world, and it has never ceased to gladden my heart, nor to remind me of the first time I saw her. (Michael Nolan, memorial address)</blockquote>They had five children: Patricia (<i>b</i>. 1954), Michael (<i>b</i>. 1955), Sheila (<i>b</i>. 1957), Anne (<i>b</i>. 1959), and Clare (<i>b</i>. 1965).<br>
<br>At the time Nolan qualified as a barrister it was notoriously difficult for a beginner to make much of an income at the common-law bar. He had to wait seven years before he could bank his first cheque. Even then he had a problem in deciding whether to frame it or bank it. This paucity of common-law work caused him to think that he might do better by joining one of the specialist bars. His reflections led him to choose the tax bar. He approached Cyril King, who was the head of a leading set. King invited him to tea in his chambers while making it clear that the decision must rest with the juniors. Nolan had tea with three of them. He was invited to have a second cup of tea. This was the moment of decision. Number 4 Pump Court became Nolan's chambers for the rest of his time at the bar.<br>
<br>Nolan's career started slowly but he gradually built up a formidable tax practice. He became a wholly persuasive advocate with a calm and measured style, and with the habit of making the main points once and once only. He would have nothing to do with schemes for the avoidance of tax. His approach was invariably ethical and principled. His exceptional grasp of accounting fundamentals led to his appointment as a member of the Sandilands committee on inflation accounting (1973&#150;5).<br>
<br>Nolan took silk in 1968. When his work involved litigation in Northern Ireland he joined the bar there too in 1974. He also became a serious performer in Singapore and Hong Kong, fortuitously starting his career in each territory with a win on behalf of the Inland Revenue. These successes naturally stimulated further briefs from both sides of the line. He was made a bencher at the Middle Temple in 1975 and took an active part in the life of the inn and its committee work. He would have been an obvious choice to become treasurer of the Middle Temple had not the volume of his public duties rendered this impossible.<h2>
<a name="Judicialoffice"></a>Judicial office</h2>In his practice Nolan had had no experience of dealing with the criminal law. To gain such experience he tried first to be appointed as a JP in Kent in order, as he put it, to see the criminal justice system from the bottom rung of the ladder. But no such appointment was forthcoming. So in 1975 he took the somewhat surprising step of applying to be appointed a recorder of the crown court. This would involve him annually in sitting for two to four weeks as a judge in a criminal court, trying cases, summing up the evidence to the jury, and sentencing those found guilty. His application was accepted and he duly sat for some seven years as a recorder. He trained himself diligently for the role by studying and sitting alongside colleagues who were recorders. He was given every assistance by both branches of the profession and by the officials who serviced the courts of the western circuit. He may have wanted to be appointed as a recorder in order to share the experience of his contemporaries at the bar. Moreover it may be that he contemplated the possibility that his name might one day come up for consideration as a candidate for a High Court judgeship and he did not want that possibility to be destroyed by the revelation that he had no knowledge of the substance and procedures of the criminal law.<br>
<br>Nolan was indeed appointed as a judge of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in 1982. He sat as a judge for many years. Much of the work was routine but some high-profile cases came before him which provided the opportunity for the display of his cool and independent judgement. In 1984 he granted the National Coal Board injunctions against the use of flying pickets by the National Union of Mineworkers. The following year he awarded injunctions in favour of Westminster council restraining the Greater London council from using posters to persuade Londoners to back the fight against its own abolition. In 1989 he awarded Muslim leaders the right to challenge a JP's refusal to issue blasphemy summonses against Salman Rushdie, author of <span class="italic">The Satanic Verses</span>. In another case he, controversially, sentenced a man who had raped his daughter to only three years in prison. No doubt Nolan believed that there were special circumstances that justified a more lenient sentence than would have been normal. But the appeal judges took a different view, and his sentence was set aside. In 1984 he was asked by the lord chief justice, Lord Lane, whether he would like to take on the job of being presiding judge on the western circuit. Nolan had never himself belonged to a circuit and had no idea what was involved. Lane explained: &#145;It is very simple. It means that if anything goes wrong on the Western Circuit you get the blame&#146;  (Mackay of Clashfern, memorial address). With this encouragement Nolan accepted.<br>
<br>In 1991 Nolan was promoted to the Court of Appeal. He had caught the eye of the lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, when they had both served on a committee set up to simplify the tax system, in the early 1970s. As a lord justice of appeal he was involved in many cases that hit the headlines. He decided that an anorexic girl could be forcibly treated against her will. In another case he agreed with the court's decision to reject compensation claims for nervous shock brought by relatives of those who died in the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. In a case arising out of the deaths of fifty-one people in the <i>Marchioness</i> riverboat disaster he refused to overturn the decision of the director of public prosecutions to bring no criminal charges. In an important case it was alleged against Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, that he had acted in contempt of court in failing to secure that a Nigerian citizen was brought back to the UK from Nigeria, since he had been aware of but had ignored an order made by a High Court judge that barred any attempt to return the would-be immigrant to Nigeria. Nolan was one of the majority in the Court of Appeal who upheld the finding of contempt against Baker, naming him personally. In the House of Lords the law lords accepted an argument to the effect that the contempt order should not name Baker personally but should be issued against the secretary of state for home affairs.<br>
<br>In 1992 Nolan was a member of a Court of Appeal panel that decided in Judith Ward's case that the prosecution had failed in its duty to share with the defence evidence that tended to show weaknesses in the prosecution's case or which revealed that the defendant's mental state was such as to make her supposed confessions intrinsically unlikely to be true. The extent of the non-disclosures and the number of persons in the prosecution team who were guilty of reprehensible conduct led the court in its judgment to state that &#145;a grave miscarriage of justice had occurred&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 5 June 1992). This decision had a very significant effect on the manner in which all prosecutions were thereafter handled.<h2>
<a name="TheCommitteeonStandardsinPublicLife"></a>The Committee on Standards in Public Life</h2>In 1994 Nolan was promoted to the House of Lords as a lord of appeal in ordinary, with the title Baron Nolan. He took as his motto to accompany his shield the three words <i>Fides, familia, lex</i>, which aptly summarized his philosophy. Much of his time as a law lord was, however, taken up by his duties as the first chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1994&#150;7). The lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, had recommended to the prime minister, John Major, that Nolan was the best lawyer to take the chair of this new committee. The prime minister asked Mackay to ascertain whether Nolan would accept the appointment. His telephone response was immediate: &#145;If the Prime Minister wants me to do it, I certainly shall&#146;  (Mackay of Clashfern, memorial address).<br>
<br>The prime minister had established the committee to deal with numerous charges of misconduct being made by members of the public and by the media against members of parliament. Most, but not all, charges were against Conservative MPs. One group of charges involved allegations that MPs took money in exchange for asking questions. A committee of nine members was appointed under Nolan's chairmanship with secretarial support. Three members represented the three major political parties, each being a serving MP or member of the House of Lords. The committee worked with extraordinary efficiency and collegiality. As Nolan insisted, all the reports produced by the committee during his term of office were unanimous. It took evidence from the public, from the media, and from experts. Evidence was taken orally in many parts of the country. The committee's hearings were held in public. There had been an episode soon after it was first appointed when a spokesman for the prime minister announced that the committee would probably sit in private. This led at once to a statement by Nolan that his committee would sit in public. That was what he was trained to do as a judge, he said, and he had no intention of altering his practice.<br>
<br>Over a period of three years the committee worked on and took evidence leading to the publication of four reports: <span class="italic">Standards in Public Life</span> (Cm 2850, 2 vols., May 1995); <span class="italic">Local Public Spending Bodies</span> (Cm 3270, 2 vols., May 1996); <span class="italic">Standards of Conduct in Local Government in England</span> (Cm 3702, 2 vols., July 1997); and <span class="italic">Review of Standards of Conduct in Executive Non-Departmental Public Bodies, NHS Trusts and Local Public Spending Bodies</span> (no command paper number, 1 vol., Nov 1997). As its title indicated, the fourth report reviewed what had been the response by late 1997 to the first two reports. The report indicated that considerable and welcome progress had been made, though more needed to be done.<br>
<br>It is clear that the first report was the most important. A striking feature was the promulgation in it of what were called the &#145;Seven Principles of Public Life&#146;, namely selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and leadership. The report stated that &#145;these principles apply to all aspects of public life. The Committee has set them out here for the benefit of all who serve the public in any way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Standards in Public Life</span>, 14). Each principle had an explanatory text. For example, selflessness, which was the first principle, was described as follows: &#145;Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends&#146;  (ibid.). The other reports produced when Nolan was chairman all repeated the seven principles in a prominent position. The principles became well known and widely reproduced, sometimes with additions.<br>
<br>The prime minister had when appointing the committee asked that it should produce its first report within six months. Nolan responded to this by saying that the available time did not permit the committee to cover the entire field in six months, so it confined its first report to the three subjects which appeared to be giving rise to the greatest public concern, namely issues relating to members of parliament; ministers and civil servants; and executive quangos and NHS bodies. As Nolan reported in a letter of May 1995 to the prime minister, published at the front of the report, the public consultation which the committee undertook confirmed that it had correctly chosen the three areas which gave rise to the greatest public concern. The experienced parliamentarians and other eminent persons who were the nine members of the committee admired the calm and gentle style of their chairman. Without making any fuss he managed to steer the debate towards his own conclusions. As one member put it, &#145;he was endlessly gentle and courteous in his handling of the committee, allowing everyone to have their say, never showing any sign of impatience&#146;  (private information). Another member confirmed that Nolan gave excellent leadership and deserved the fullest credit for the respect the committee enjoyed and for the standing that its reports subsequently had: &#145;Certainly I found it a matter of pride but also something which did command wide respect&#151;the simple statement that &#147;I was a member of the Nolan Committee&#148;&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>When the first report was published it was well received by the public. But some of those who were criticized in the report (such as members of parliament) were highly critical. They claimed that they were represented as acting like criminals. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, declared that Nolan seemed to lack a certain &#145;worldliness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 May 1995). Nolan, however, was quite impervious to such criticism and simply carried on with his work on the next three reports. The public was impressed. The House of Commons decided to implement the recommendations that concerned it; and the omnipresent sleaze that had been gaining ground in the early 1990s suffered a serious check (albeit to resurface in the form of the abuse of parliamentary expenses in the following decade).<h2>
<a name="Retirementhonoursandfinalyears"></a>Retirement, honours, and final years</h2>Nolan retired as a lord of appeal in ordinary in 1998, having reached the age of seventy. He seldom spoke in debates on the floor of the house. When he did so the speech or intervention tended to be linked to matters of which he had personal knowledge from his time on the bench. He remained an interception of communications commissioner until 2002, having been appointed in 1994. The last task he undertook in relation to the setting of standards was carried out at the request of the archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor. Many cases had been reported in the media in the 1990s where Catholic priests were charged with sexual abuse of children. In some instances the abuse had continued over a period of years and had resulted in grave trauma for the children. In 2000 the cardinal asked Nolan to investigate child protection in the Catholic church in England and Wales and to report, giving his recommendations for cleansing the stables. He immediately undertook the task with a committee. His first report was published in 2001. The tone was set by an early paragraph in this report:<blockquote>Child abuse is a great evil. It can leave deep scars on victims and their families. It is particularly abhorrent when a child or young person is abused by someone in a position of trust and responsibility. It is most abhorrent when that position of trust is held by a member of the clergy or a lay Church worker. The care of children is at the forefront of the teachings of Christ and is, therefore, one of the primary responsibilities of all members of the Church led by their priests and bishops.</blockquote>The report made some fifty recommendations, including fundamental provisions to the effect that there should be an investigation into the background of every person who wanted to serve the church in any capacity who might come into contact with children. All with doubtful backgrounds should be denied employment and all contact. Those who appeared innocent but who were subsequently alleged to have transgressed should be debarred from contact subject to a full investigation of the allegations.Nolan was a member of the Bar Council for 1973&#150;4 and a member of the senate of the inns of court and the bar for seven years (1974&#150;81), for two of which (1977&#150;9) he held the office of treasurer. He was a member of the governing body of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Woldingham (1973&#150;83), and a governor of Combe Bank School (1974&#150;83). He was an honorary fellow of Wadham College from 1992, chairman of the board of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies from 1994 to 2000, and from 1997 to 2002 he was chancellor of Essex University, well known for his &#145;hands-on&#146; approach in the role. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex (1996), Surrey (1996), Warwick (1998), Exeter (1998), Middlesex (1999), and Bournemouth (2000). In 2002 he was made a knight of St George. In 1996&#150;7 he and Sir Stephen Sedley gave between them six Radcliffe lectures (three each) at the University of Warwick. The series was entitled &#145;The making and remaking of the British constitution&#146;. Geoffrey Wilson delivered a postscript and the entire collection was published.<br>
<br>A contemporary from Oxford (not himself from Ampleforth or on the Nolan committee) observed: &#145;I think what characterised Michael was always a quiet and courteously managed certainty in all that he undertook&#146;. While lacking proof he was inclined to identify Nolan's time at Ampleforth as providing the engine for this. &#145;Michael was a very faithful Roman Catholic, and one became aware of this and&#151;I think&#151;of an inner strength of mind and purpose deriving from it&#151;the better one got to know him&#146;  (private information). Lord Lloyd of Berwick wrote that &#145;Michael was a marvellous judge to sit with. Like Denning, he had a clarity of mind, and simplicity of language which few have equalled. Of all the judges I have known, he was the least ostentatious&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 26 Jan 2007).<br>
<br>Nolan died at his home, Old Farm Cottage, Scords Lane, Toys Hill, Westerham, Kent, on 22 January 2007 of bronchopneumonia and multi-system atrophy, having had to endure a progressive degenerative disease that ultimately took away even his capacity to speak, leaving only the ability to smile. It was appropriate that a splendid memorial service should have been held on 22 March 2007 at Westminster Cathedral with Cardinal Murphy O'Connor presiding. In his homily he expressed his &#145;great admiration, esteem and gratitude for someone who did the Church a great service, but did it in such a way that it seemed the most natural thing for him to do&#146;. The congregation was asked by the cardinal to &#145;remember and pray for the repose of the soul of this good man, Michael Nolan&#146;  (Cardinal Murphy O'Connor, homily). Nolan was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their five children, three of whom followed careers in the law.<br>
