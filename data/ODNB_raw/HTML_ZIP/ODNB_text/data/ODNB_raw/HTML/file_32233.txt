<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cadman,  John</span>, first Baron Cadman  (1877&#150;1941), <span class="occ">mining engineer and industrialist</span>, was born on 7 September 1877 at The Villas, in the north Staffordshire mining village of Silverdale, the eldest son of James Cope Cadman (1851&#150;1914) and his wife, Betty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keeling (<i>d</i>. 1924). His father was a mining surveyor and engineer and the general manager of the Silverdale Coal and Iron Works; later he became president of the Institution of Mining Engineers, in 1903. After local schooling, Cadman left Newcastle under Lyme high school at seventeen to become a pupil of his father. He attended local mining classes which the Staffordshire county technical education department had established for working miners. In 1896 Cadman won the council's first county mining scholarship, to study geology and mining at Armstrong College in Newcastle upon Tyne, then part of Durham College of Science, where he graduated BSc (first class) in 1899 and MSc in 1902; he was elected fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1900 and became DSc in 1908.<br>
<br>After graduation Cadman went to Silverdale as assistant general manager to his father. Then, after a period as a colliery agent in Durham, he moved to Scotland in 1902 as HM inspector of mines (east Scotland), before once more returning to Staffordshire as HM inspector in 1903. Here he was to show conspicuous bravery in mine rescue work, particularly at the Hamstead colliery disaster of March 1908. In September 1904 he was seconded as chief mining engineer for Trinidad and Tobago. Having previously encountered oil seeps in Staffordshire and the oil shales of Fife and Lothian, he was now introduced to the natural oil and bitumen of the asphalt lakes. From then on it was the oil industry to which he was to make such a major contribution, though he remained a loyal servant of the coal industry too. This posting also introduced Cadman to his future wife, Lilian Julia (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of John Harrigan, magistrate of Port of Spain, Trinidad. They married on 27 July 1907, and had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1908, soon after his return to England, Cadman was appointed professor of mining at Birmingham University, where his main duties were to lecture on the mining of coal and metal ores. However, his interests in oil were already aroused and he gave courses on petroleum as soon as he took up his chair, when there were only about twenty students in the department. To demonstrate the vital role he saw for the emerging oil industry, in 1912 he set up the first undergraduate course in Britain on petroleum mining technology, leading to the new degree of bachelor of science (petroleum). Cadman drew initially on his oil experiences in England, Scotland, and Trinidad, but these were soon augmented by his introduction to oil in the Middle East in 1913. Cadman's desire to integrate the training of geologists, chemists, and engineers was furthered when Professor W. S. Boulton established a petroleum exploration course in the geology department, which Cadman's petroleum mining students could take for their final year.<br>
<br>These courses had been established in the face of much academic opposition; T. H. Holland (1868&#150;1947), professor of geology at Manchester University, reported in 1913:<blockquote>I really cannot find one commendable feature in the latest and most flagrantly advertised of our now bewildering variety of university degrees, the &#145;B.Sc. (Petroleum Mining)&#146;, at Birmingham &hellip; It is unfair to entice young men into a blind alley, and saddle them with a freak title that will handicap every attempt that they make in after life to specialise in a recognised branch of technology. (Holland, 351&#150;2)</blockquote>In 1913 Cadman, appointed to the Admiralty commission on fuel oil under Admiral Sir Edmund Slade, visited the Persian oilfields to report on whether an assured supply of oil could be found there for the British navy, thus fulfilling the wishes of Admiral John Arbuthnot Fisher (1841&#150;1920) to convert the engines of British navy ships to burn oil. The commission's report influenced Churchill's epoch making decision to adopt oil burning engines in the British fleet. It also dramatically changed the fortunes of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), in which the government acquired a majority holding in 1914. Cadman also helped to organize the search for oil in Britain during the First World War, using imported American technology. Two of the sites chosen to drill for oil were in north Staffordshire. These attempts, to check the sources of the local oil seeps which he had long known, gave useful, if negative, lessons for the future. Cadman was made CMG in 1916.<br>
<br>Cadman was a founder member of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists, established in London in March 1914 to advance both the study of petroleum and British interests in the rapidly developing world of oil. Clashes of personality at the institution, amid crises over maintaining oil supplies to Britain and the empire during the First World War, disrupted the two academic petroleum courses available in Britain (that in London had started in 1913). When the war ended a major libel action resulted, which was won by Cadman. This, with the death of Sir Boverton Redwood amid the aftermath of war, caused the true significance of these developments to be forgotten.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Cadman emerged as the leading British authority on oil. He directed HM petroleum executive between 1917 and 1921 with conspicuous success. He was appointed KCMG in 1918 for this service. With the ending of war, he was appointed technical adviser on oil to the British government and, with much new diplomatic work demanding long absences from Birmingham, he resigned his chair there in 1920. In 1921 he was made technical adviser to APOC and moved to London. With typical energy, he collaborated with Standard Oil of America and encouraged American participation in the Turkish Petroleum Company. In this Cadman proved a fine diplomat and successful negotiator. He was largely responsible for stopping the aggressive and self-destructive oil policies then existing between Britain and the United States.<br>
<br>In 1923 Cadman became a managing director of APOC. Here he organized the better application of science to industry and to oil exploration, and he built up the research element of APOC's operations. Cadman was instrumental in encouraging the British Geological Survey's foray into geophysics, by giving it APOC advice and funds. These allowed survey officers to see first-hand the results of their geophysical work in the field in Persia. Cadman's management skills, helped by an unusual understanding of human nature, were appreciated by many in APOC, and 1925 saw him appointed deputy chairman; early in 1927 he became chairman, a post he retained until his death. These were remarkable appointments, with Cadman the first &#145;professor&#146; scientist to become chairman of a British industrial company with a capital of tens of millions of pounds. He was rewarded by being made GCMG in 1929. He also played a vital role by acting as chairman in setting up the Iraq Petroleum Company and by devising a pipeline by which Iraqi oil could reach the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>Cadman fought any division of science into &#145;pure&#146; or &#145;applied&#146;. Alongside his pioneering role in the international oil industry, he showed his continuing vision in his involvements with the Bridgeman committee on television from 1935, which he later chaired. This was the first body to see the future significance of this new means of communication. Not content with this, in 1937 Cadman was asked to chair a government committee into the work of Imperial Airways and the future of international aviation transport. Cadman thus played a vital role in three of the most significant developments of the twentieth century. He was awarded several honorary degrees and became Lord Cadman in 1937, choosing to recall his mining birthplace as Baron Cadman of Silverdale. He was finally elected FRS in 1940.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Cadman was a devout Anglican, and he was appreciated for his friendliness, humour, and humanity. He enjoyed music and played the violin in his earlier years. He died from a stroke, at his home, Shenley Park, near Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, on 31 May 1941, aged sixty-three, worn out by further wartime work. He was buried at his birthplace, Silverdale, in the church of St Luke on 4 June. He had made an enormous and international contribution to the industry he had helped to create, making probably the greatest contribution to oil ever achieved by an individual Briton. He is honoured by the Cadman medals which are awarded by Birmingham University, the Institute of Petroleum, and the Institution of Mining Engineers, and by the Cadman memorial lectures of the Institute of Petroleum and the Royal Society of Arts.<br>
