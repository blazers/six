<span class="headword">Rose,  William John</span>  (1885&#150;1968), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Minnedosa, Manitoba, Canada, on 7 August 1885, the eldest of ten children of Henry Rose (1852&#150;1923), farmer, and his wife, Prudence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKinney (1857&#150;1927). From 1900 to 1905 he studied classics at Wesley College, Winnipeg, whence he gained a Rhodes scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1905. He graduated with a third-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1908. From 1908 to 1912 he was a lecturer in history at the University of Manitoba. On 5 June 1912, at Pilot Mound, Manitoba, he married Emily Mary Cuthbert. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Intending to take a doctorate in classics, in 1912 Rose returned to Europe, accompanied by his wife, and enrolled at Leipzig University. In 1913, however, he moved to the Charles University, Prague, as a representative of the World Student Christian Movement (he was throughout his life a devout nonconformist Christian), on whose behalf in the summer of 1914 he organized a conference at Ligotka, in Cieszyn Silesia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 the Roses were liable to internment, but they were permitted a degree of liberty, under supervision, living in Ligotka with a Polish Lutheran pastor. Rose set about learning Polish and studying Polish history and literature. In October 1918, as Austrian authority in Silesia began to collapse, a Polish national committee was formed in Cieszyn, which commissioned Rose to go to Vienna, find representatives of the allies there, and present to them the case for an independent Poland, including Cieszyn. He eventually arrived at the peace conference in Paris, where he reported on the Silesian situation. Friendships formed there led to his involvement in 1920 in the foundation of the British Institute of International Affairs (later the Royal Institute of International Affairs).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1919, Rose had returned to Poland, employed by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) on student relief. He registered to study at the University of Warsaw, but in 1920 his employers transferred him to Cracow. There, while continuing to work for the YMCA, he enrolled as a doctoral student at the Jagellonian University and wrote a thesis on the eighteenth-century educational reformer Stanis&#322;aw Konarski. He received his doctorate in 1926 and the thesis was published in London in 1929 as <span class="italic">Stanislas Konarski: Reformer of Education in XVIIIth Century Poland</span>. In 1926&#150;7 the Roses resided at Milan&oacute;wek, outside Warsaw.<br>
<br>In 1927 Rose was appointed assistant professor of sociology at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA, but his stay there was interrupted in 1932 by an invitation to study the Upper Silesian problem. The fruit of the next two years, during which he had his headquarters in Katowice, was his penetrating analysis <span class="italic">The Drama of Upper Silesia</span> (1936), which secured him international status. In 1935 he was appointed reader in Polish studies at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in the University of London, and three years later he became professor of Polish literature and history there, a position he held until 1950. From 1939 to 1947 he was simultaneously director of the school. On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 the school was moved to Oxford, where it was accommodated in Regent's Park College. Rose worked in Balliol College in the foreign research and press service of the Foreign Office, which was culling information from the world's press for intelligence purposes. In February 1943 he returned to London, where the School of Slavonic and East European Studies had resumed work in May 1941, operating in bomb-damaged buildings. In 1947 Rose resigned as director, when it was decided to make the directorship a full-time post, but he continued to hold his chair until retirement in 1950.<br>
<br>After his retirement Rose returned to Canada as a visiting professor at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. He was the author of some 300 published works, including six books (one of them a <span class="roman">Penguin Special</span> on Poland in 1939), and in recognition of his scholarly output in 1953 the University of British Columbia elected him doctor of laws <i>honoris causa</i>. Although most of his output was written in a popularizing vein, introducing the English-speaking world to various facets of Polish culture and history, his original contributions to Polish historiography were significant, notably in <span class="italic">Stanislas Konarski</span> and <span class="italic">The Drama of Upper Silesia</span>. His work was not always unbiased, however, for he saw his role, broadly speaking, as explaining the Polish point of view. In 1956 he moved to the Christian Leadership Training School in Naramata, British Columbia, where he taught history. A widower since the early 1950s, he lived for the rest of his life in a small white cottage on Lake Okanagan. He had an athletic bent and loved the outdoor life. In the summer he wore shorts and a broad-brimmed straw hat, and even when over eighty he would still plunge daily into the cold waters of Lake Okanagan. A pipe-smoker and a keen chess-player, known to his friends and students as Uncle Bill, he also found pleasure in golf, gardening, and classical music. He died in Vancouver on 10 March 1968.<br>
