<span class="headword">Averell,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1556, <em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 12 February 1556, the son of John Averell (<i>d</i>. 1569), joiner, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1578). Nothing is known of his youth and education but he was a member of the Merchant Taylors' and Vintners' companies and supported himself as parish clerk and schoolmaster in the London parish of St Peter's Cornhill, where he lived at Corbetes Court. He married Gyllian (1556&#150;1596), daughter of Robert Goodale, baker, and his wife, Ann, on 2 November 1578. Somewhat ironically, given the moralism of some of his pamphlets, the couple's first child, Annes, was born on 2 February 1579, three months after the wedding. His wife died after the birth of the last of their seventeen children. In addition to adorning the parish register with drawings and poems, Averell published several works showing literary versatility and a keen desire to acquire the patronage of the London civic &eacute;lite. Averell's first known publication, the 1581 <span class="italic">An excellent historie, both pithy and pleasant, on the life and death of Charles and Julia, two Brittish, or rather Welsh lovers</span>, a verse tale of star-crossed lovers set in the period of British mythology dating from the Trojan settlement, was dedicated to the mercer and brewer Henry Campyon. Not a distinguished piece of literature, it was one of the few romantic poems of the period that employed a British rather than an Italian setting. It was followed in 1583 by a prodigy pamphlet, <span class="italic">A wonderfull and straunge newes, which happened in the county of Suffolke, and Essex, the first of February, being Friday, where in rayned wheat, the space of vi or vii miles compass</span>, which took a zealously protestant stand, arguing that the wonder presaged the end of the world.<br>
<br>Averell's 1584 collection of three moral narratives on divine punishment for sin and reward for virtue, <span class="italic">A Dyall for Dainty Darlings</span>, was dedicated to William Wrathe, warden of the Mercers' Company, and identified Averell on its title-page as &#145;Student in Divinitie and Schoolmaister&#146;. It was issued again in an expanded edition as <span class="italic">Four Notable Histories</span> in 1590, this time dedicated to the London alderman, leatherworker, and Marian exile Hugh Ofley. Averell's 1588 <span class="italic">A Mervalious Combat of Contrarieties</span> began as a dialogue between the parts of the body in which the tongue, urging a revolt of the body against the belly and back on the grounds of their greed and pride, was eventually unmasked as a traitor. Abandoning the dialogue format, it concluded with an exhortation for loyalty to the queen. Published in the Armada crisis, it was dedicated to the lord mayor of London, Sir George Bonde, and included fierce attacks on Roman Catholics and Jesuits. <span class="italic">A Mervalious Combat</span> was the principal source for William Shakespeare's use of the parable of the revolt of the members against the belly in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>. It was later reprinted in <span class="italic">Four Notable Histories</span>.<br>
<br>Averell's prose is Euphuistic and his writings draw on classical knowledge, but he is not recorded as a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. A second marriage to an unknown bride produced another child, Elizabeth, born on 28 November 1597. Averell was buried at St Peter's Cornhill on 23 September 1605.<br>
