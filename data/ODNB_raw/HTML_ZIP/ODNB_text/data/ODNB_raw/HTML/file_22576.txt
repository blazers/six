<span class="headword">Porter,  Robert</span>  (1623/4&#150;1690), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Nottingham, the son of William Porter of Nottingham, a musician. After attending school at Nottingham under Mr Leake he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on 1 July 1639 aged fifteen; he graduated BA in 1643. His activities in the next years are not known, but in a later aside he remarked that Derbyshire was &#145;the country where I began and ended my publicke ministry&#146;  (Porter, 49). He was a minister at Pentrich by 1650, but he also preached at other places. On 27 August 1651 Henry Newcome, rector of Gawsworth, and John Machin, curate of Great Budworth, both in Cheshire, &#145;went to Audley to have heard Mr Porter; and when we came there we found he was not come, and so were forced both of us to preach, and the Lord did enable us exceedingly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.32). Porter was moderator of the Wirksworth classis on 16 December 1651 and attended most of its subsequent meetings in the period covered by the extant minutes up to 17 November 1658, giving several ordination sermons and acting as moderator on nine occasions.<br>
<br>The name of Porter's wife and the date of their marriage are unknown, but three children were born to them at Pentrich&#151;Hannah in 1652, Richard in 1654, and Elizabeth in 1658. In 1656 Porter's wife was ill, or lost a baby. On 29 July 1656 Newcome &#145;called at Pentridge to see Mr Porter (whose wife was that day just brought in bed) and we came late to Hopton to Mr Gell's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 60). &#145;Mr Gell&#146; was John Gell (1613&#150;1689) of Hopton House near Wirksworth, then MP for Derbyshire, future protector of ejected ministers, married to Katherine Packer of Donnington Castle near Newbury. Katherine wrote to Richard Baxter that Robert Porter was her only other spiritual adviser, to whom she had confided her fear of the dark. In response Porter &#145;advised me to avoid the occasion of the temptation and goe to prayer while it was light&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.273); Porter's wife survived the illness or childbirth to which Newcome referred but not long afterwards the minister himself was seriously ill, for on 17 July 1660 Newcome was at an inn near Nottingham, and &#145;found Mr Porter there, whom I was glad to see alive and so well as there I found him, whom I had prayed for and begged that he might live&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.125).<br>
<br>Porter was ejected from Pentrich in 1662 (his farewell sermon was among those published in <span class="italic">England's Remembrancer</span>, 1663) and his successor was instituted on 2 February the following year. The record (20 April 1672) of his acknowledgement of receipt of a general licence, to preach in any licensed meeting-place, gives Porter as of Mansfield, the town where he and his wife had baptized their fourth known child, Faith, in 1666. On 2 and 3 May Porter was licensed as a presbyterian preacher at &#145;Mr John Walker's house of the town and county of Nottingham&#146;, and at the house of Robert Vincent  (Turner, 1.297). Robert Porter died on 22 January 1690 at Mansfield where he was buried two days later.<br>
<br>Porter's account of several of his ministerial colleagues, <span class="italic">The life of Mr John Hieron, with the characters and memorials of ten other worthy ministers of Jesus Christ</span> was published the year after his death. However, a suggestion for a biography of Porter was turned down by his fellow Nottinghamshire nonconformist John Whitlock on the grounds that Porter's sermons were &#145;written in so small an hand that there are not many can make any thing of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 527).<br>
