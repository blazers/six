<span class="headword">Pearman,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1792, <em>d.</em> in or after 1825), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at Manchester of poor but respectable parents. He entered the navy as a cabin-boy, but, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Copenhagen, retired with a pension from the service. He then made some unsuccessful attempts to become an actor, and appeared in London at Tooting and at the Sans Pareil Theatre (from October 1819 the Adelphi) in the Strand, and with W. C. Macready's company at Newcastle. He went on to achieve success as a singer of Charles Dibdin's nautical songs at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. John Addison gave him lessons, which enabled him to take leading singing parts in provincial theatres, including those at Bath and Bristol, and Macready engaged him once more at Newcastle as leading vocalist in musical drama.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1817 Pearman made his d&eacute;but at the English Opera House as Orlando in the comic opera <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span>, which was a great success. Other roles in light opera included Captain Macheath in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, which was judged to be the best on the stage. In 1819 Pearman was retained at Drury Lane for secondary parts (John Braham taking the leads), and in 1822 at Covent Garden; however, his voice and style seem to have been ineffective in a large house. His best effort there was said to be the imitative song &#145;Ne'er shall I forget the day&#146;, in the opera <span class="italic">Clari, or, The Maid of Milan</span>, composed for him by Sir Henry Bishop. In September 1824 he distinguished himself as Rodolph in one of several altered versions of Weber's <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> at the English Opera House, a role he repeated at Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Pearman's natural voice, soft or veiled in tone (Oxberry describes it as &#145;smothered&#146;), did not reach beyond E, although he could force a G. His falsetto was sweet when audible, but it was not possible for him to sing many tenor songs in their original key. He was also unable to make use of the trill, and in 1825 he was taking lessons from an Italian singing teacher. He was a small man, about 5 feet 3 inches tall, but well proportioned. His complexion was &#145;sallow; his hair and eyes dark; and the <i>contour</i> of his countenance decidedly foreign&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxberry</span>, 151). His manner was so graceful that his lameness (due to his injured leg) was scarcely evident. He was a good-humoured man whose talent as an actor was widely recognized. Oxberry hints at Pearman living beyond his means, and also mentions that he<blockquote>married, some years since, the daughter of a small inn-keeper. The temper of our hero is not exactly of a nature to render the marriage state happy; and he who has been the victim of tyranny in his youth, too frequently becomes a tyrant in his turn. (<span class="italic">Oxberry</span>, 152)</blockquote>Nothing is known of him after 1825.<br>
