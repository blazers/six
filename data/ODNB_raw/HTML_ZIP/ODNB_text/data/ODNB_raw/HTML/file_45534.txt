<span class="headword">Duns,  John</span>  (1820&#150;1909), <span class="occ">United Free Church of Scotland minister and university teacher</span>, was born in Duns, Berwickshire, on 11 July 1820, son of William Duns and Sarah Allan. He was educated locally before entering Edinburgh University to study medicine. The events that culminated in the Disruption of the Church of Scotland inspired him to abandon medicine in favour of the ministry. The Free Church of Scotland licensed him to preach in 1843 and in the following year he was ordained minister of the Free Church, Torphichen, West Lothian. Duns married, on 12 June 1844, Margaret Monteith. The proceeds of her successful, if anonymous, activity as a novelist were applied to the reduction of the congregation's debt.<br>
<br>While he was at Torphichen, Duns encountered Sir James Young Simpson, whose paternal home was in nearby Bathgate, and they developed a friendship based on their shared interest in antiquarian subjects. Duns also developed an interest in geology. In 1854 he published a <span class="italic">Memoir of the Late Rev Samuel Martin</span>, of Bathgate, and in 1857 he acted as editor of the <span class="italic">North British Review</span>. He edited John Fleming's <span class="italic">The Lithology of Edinburgh</span> (1859), to which he also contributed a memoir. His most substantial work was the two-volume <span class="italic">Biblical Natural Science</span> (1863&#150;6), which was issued in twenty-four parts at 2<i>s</i>. per part. The work was heavily illustrated with woodcuts and engraved plates. Another work, <span class="italic">Science and Christian Thought</span>, appeared in 1866. In 1873 he published his <span class="italic">Memoir of Sir J. Y. Simpson, Bart.</span>
<br>
<br>In May 1864 Duns was appointed to succeed John Fleming (1785&#150;1857) in the chair of natural science at New College, Edinburgh. At first, this was no more than a lectureship, and the long delay in replacing Fleming reflected the division of opinion in the church as to the appropriateness of retaining such a subject in a theological college. However, in December 1869 fresh endowments were forthcoming to restore the full professorship. Despite his long tenure and his undoubted learning Duns was never an especially influential figure in his church. Perhaps this was because, as an obituary observed, &#145;it was for his College that he principally lived. Assembly and Presbytery saw little of him, nor did he take any part in ecclesiastical debate, unattracted thereby and perhaps overconscious of a certain hesitancy in speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">Missionary Record</span>, 106). The sentiment was echoed by Alexander Martin in a tribute delivered to Edinburgh United Free Presbytery: &#145;The New College never had a greater friend, never a servant who loved her better or gave himself more unweariedly to the promotion of all her varied interests&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 3 Feb 1909).<br>
<br>Duns published a number of scholarly papers arising from his scientific and antiquarian interests, and he contributed greatly to the museums of New College and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1859 (vice-president, 1899&#150;1903) and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1875 (vice-president, 1878). Duns was also president of the Royal Physical Society, Edinburgh, in 1868 and Rhind lecturer in archaeology in 1890. Duns's long service at New College ended with his retirement in 1903; thereafter he resided at Hilderley, North Berwick, East Lothian, where he died on 1 February 1909. He was buried in the parish graveyard there on 3 February.<br>
