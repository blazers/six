<span class="headword">Pratten,  Robert Sidney</span>  (1824&#150;1868), <span class="occ">flautist</span>, was born on 23 January 1824 in Bristol, the second son of a professor of music who was for many years flautist at the Bristol theatre. His mother's maiden name was Sidney. He was considered a prodigy on the flute, and on 25 March 1835, at Clifton, made an early d&eacute;but, playing Charles Nicholson's arrangement of &#145;O dolce concento&#146;. When only twelve he performed at concerts in Bath and Bristol. After engagements as first flute at the Dublin Theatre Royal and with other musical societies in the city, he arrived in London in 1846. The duke of Cambridge and Lady Tonkin were interested in his talent, and he was sent to Germany to study composition. Pratten's popular piece for flute and piano accompaniment <span class="italic">L'esp&eacute;rance</span> was published in Leipzig in 1847. Upon his return to London in 1848, he soon rose to the front rank of his art. He played first flute at the Royal Italian Opera, the English Opera, the Sacred Harmonic Society, the Philharmonic Society, and other concerts and musical festivals, including the Musical Society of London and Alfred Mellon's concerts. Contemporaries praised his powerful tone and brilliant execution. He also wrote instruction books for his instrument, among them special studies for Siccama's diatonic flute (1848) and for his own perfected flute (1856), as well as a <span class="italic">Concertst&uuml;ck</span> (1852) and many arrangements of operatic airs for flute in combination with other instruments.<br>
<br>On 24 September 1854 Pratten married Catharina Josepha Pelzer, a guitarist born at M&uuml;lheim on the Rhine. She made her reputation as a child artist in Germany, and in her ninth year appeared at the King's Theatre, London, eventually settling in the capital as a teacher of the guitar, for which she composed a number of pieces and wrote instruction manuals. She died on 10 October 1895.<br>
<br>Pratten died after a long illness on 10 February 1868 at 21 Paragon, Ramsgate. His younger brother Frederick was an eminent double bass player engaged in London's principal orchestras, who died in London on 3 March 1873.<br>
