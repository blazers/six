<span class="headword">Kandel,  Isaac Leon</span>  (1881&#150;1965), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in Romania, the son of Abraham Kandel, a velvet merchant, and his wife, Fanny. The family moved to Manchester when he was a child, and he attended Manchester grammar school from 1892 to 1899. He won a university scholarship and studied classics at Manchester University from 1899 to 1902, graduating with first-class honours. Four years later he was awarded the MA and in the same year completed the teacher's diploma course where he came under the stimulating influence of Professor J. J. Findlay and the academic study of pedagogy, and of Michael Sadler, the professor of the history and administration of education. Both shared an admiration for the Jena educationist Wilhelm Rein, whom Kandel visited in 1907. At Manchester University he had met Jessie Sara Davis (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), a classicist and trained teacher; they married at the Great Synagogue, Prestwich, on 27 July 1915, and had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>Kandel taught his subject briefly at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution before moving to America in 1908 (where he became a citizen in 1920), studying at the Teachers' College, Columbia University, for a PhD, which was awarded in 1910 for a dissertation on the training of elementary school teachers in Germany. He worked with Paul Monroe, head of the Teachers' College, on the important <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Education</span> from 1909 until 1913, when he was appointed a lecturer at the Teachers' College. Concurrently acting as a researcher for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching from 1914 to 1923, he explored many aspects of education and, in contributions to the United States bureau of education's <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>, deepened his interest in foreign systems, particularly those of Germany, France, and Britain. His studies were assisted by his exceptional linguistic ability. The international institute of the college had links with the New Era Fellowship with which Kandel had sympathies, particularly with its emphasis on human fulfilment, peace, and co-operation, although he disliked the dogmatism of some progressive educators. The views of Findlay and Sadler on the vital role of the teacher and the cultural aspects of education were reinforced by a colleague, W. C. Bagley, a leader of the essentialist movement in education. In 1923 Kandel was promoted from associate professor to the chair of the history of education, and he remained in that post until his retirement in 1946.<br>
<br>Kandel wrote numerous papers and books. Early studies were a <span class="italic">History of Secondary Education</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">The Making of Nazis</span> (1935). A complex historical perspective underlay all his work and contributed to his understanding of comparative studies:<blockquote>The history of education has in the main been devoted to a study of theories and practices in isolation instead of being what it should be, a study of the relationships between education and cultural backgrounds in the fullest sense of the term, concerned with the history of culture and politics and their impact on education. (<span class="italic">Universities Quarterly</span>, 3/3, May 1949)</blockquote>Such an approach ensured that comparative education as taught by Kandel was an academically robust form of analysis far removed from the mere collection of data on foreign systems. His pioneering reputation was established in 1933 with the publication of the classic and widely translated <span class="italic">Studies in Comparative Education</span>, which laid a basis for the increasingly sophisticated analysis of educational systems during the rest of the century. <span class="italic">The New Era in Education</span> (1955) was complementary, as it picked up and developed &#145;trends already in the making&#146;  (preface, ix) when the earlier volume was published. Other influential methodological statements, both called <span class="italic">Comparative Education</span>, appeared in 1936 and 1939.<br>
<br>Always seeking to understand underlying causes in education despite superficial similarities and wary of transferring practices from one country to another, Kandel in his books <span class="italic">Conflicting Theories of Education</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Education in an Era of Transition</span> (1948) reflected the social and political complexities of the 1930s and 1940s; on the other hand his <span class="italic">The Impact of the War upon American Education</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">American Education in the Twentieth Century</span> (1955) focused on his own society. He was in demand as a visiting professor and taught at Johns Hopkins, Yale, and the universities of California, Maine, and Pennsylvania; his lectures at Harvard and the University of London in the 1930s resulted in the books <span class="italic">The Dilemma of Democracy</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">The Outlook in Education</span> (1933). His scholarship and international outlook were recognized by honorary degrees from the universities of Melbourne and North Carolina, while France conferred on him the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. As well as many contributions to works of reference he was editor from 1924 until 1944 of Colombia University's influential <span class="italic">Educational Year Book</span>, and from 1946 to 1953 edited the weekly journal <span class="italic">School and Society</span>. Kandel's reputation was recognized by his election to the distinguished National Academy of Education. His stature as an internationalist and a prudent educationist drew him into the orbit of government and from 1937 to 1946 he was a member of the United States national committee on intellectual co-operation, and he was invited to join a Jamaican committee to reform secondary education. In 1946 he was part of the United States education mission to Japan.<br>
<br>After so long at Columbia University, Kandel had a brief but notable second career when he returned in 1947 to Manchester University as a Simon research fellow. His intellectual energy was at once apparent both in the university and outside, and in 1947 he presided over the North of England Education Conference. America's importance in the war had encouraged the British government in 1941 to encourage greater understanding of American life through education. Manchester responded and set about what proved to be a frustrating attempt to secure a suitable person to head a proposed department of American studies. During his fellowship year Kandel's ability was quickly recognized, and he was the first professor of American studies from 1948 to 1950. He created an innovative department which drew on and co-ordinated the academic resources of the university. His experience and wide knowledge were of value to Lord Simon of Wythenshawe, the founder and editor of the <span class="italic">Universities Quarterly</span>, and on Simon's appointment as chairman of the BBC Kandel became editor. His work and personality were so highly regarded at Manchester that his resignation in 1950 was greatly regretted.<br>
<br>This was not the end of Kandel's career. He continued to write and travel extensively and consolidated the internationalist approach advocated in his <span class="italic">International Co-operation: National and International</span> (1944). From 1946 he was an effective consultant with UNESCO, writing particularly on education as a human right and compulsory education, themes continued in work for the United Nations human rights division in 1955. In a period of decolonization he turned his attention to the educational issues of independence and development. In 1960 he attended a conference at Natal University in South Africa, where he witnessed the effects of apartheid. Kandel died in Geneva, Switzerland, on 14 June 1965.<br>
