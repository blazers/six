<span class="headword">Stratton,  Adam  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1292<span class="mult">x</span>4), <span class="occ">administrator and moneylender</span>, was the son of Thomas de Argoges (or Arwillis) of Stratton St Margaret, Wiltshire. Of his early life, nothing is known. The first firm evidence of Adam occurs in 1256, by when he was already a royal clerk attached to the exchequer. Stratton St Margaret was a dependency of Sevenhampton, a manor held by the Redvers earls of Devon as hereditary chamberlains of the exchequer. It seems likely, therefore, that it was to the influence of the Redvers family that Stratton owed his early career at the exchequer. After 1257, when the seventh earl came of age following a long minority, Stratton's association with the Redvers family was almost continuous. Between 1260 and 1262 he acted as the earl's attorney at the royal court, and in the latter year as an executor of his will. Soon afterwards he entered the service of Isabella de Forz, countess of Aumale and sister to the seventh earl of Devon, whom he served in various capacities until 1286.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Stratton's primary sphere of activity lay at the exchequer. In 1262 he became the weigher of the receipt, an office he acquired from its hereditary holder, John of Windsor, and which in 1265 he granted, for life, to his brother William of Stratton, who held it until 1290. In 1266 he also secured grants of 6<i>d</i>. a day for life from the king for his two other brothers, Henry and Thomas, who were clerics. By the mid-1260s Stratton himself had become the chamberlain of the receipt, and thus the deputy of Isabella de Forz, now the hereditary chamberlain of the exchequer in succession to her brother. In 1276, however, Isabella granted him, in fee, her own chamberlainship of the exchequer, along with its appurtenant manor of Sevenhampton, which he held until his fall in 1290. In addition he also acquired possession, in fee, of half the ushership of the receipt, which he also held until 1290.<br>
<br>In addition to his duties at the exchequer Stratton was involved, from the late 1250s, with the supervision of the king's works at Westminster Abbey and Palace. Between 1264 and 1272 he was officially keeper of the Westminster works, though he may have been acting as keeper for some time before this. More than his work at the exchequer, it was probably his association with Westminster that brought him into contact with Henry III, and produced for him the continuing stream of royal gifts and grants of ecclesiastical livings that he enjoyed during the last years of the old king's reign. These gifts continued under Edward I. By 1290 his ecclesiastical income alone was reckoned by Bartholomew Cotton to amount to &pound;1000 per annum.<br>
<br>Stratton's enormous wealth was certainly due in part to his clerical offices, but primarily it was the product of his moneylending, and of his related trafficking in Jewish debts and in the mortgaged estates which guaranteed them. His position and privileges as an exchequer clerk were of considerable advantage to him in this business, which earned him an unsavoury reputation for sharp practice and dishonesty. It is not possible to determine exactly when he began his career as a moneylender, but he was already well established in it by 1260. It was probably as a result of his moneylending, indeed, that Stratton acquired his position as the weigher of the receipt in 1262. By 1271 he had also begun to lend money in partnership with the Riccardi of Lucca, Italian moneylenders and wool merchants with whom he would thereafter be closely involved.<br>
<br>Typical of Stratton's methods as a moneylender were the loans he made to Bermondsey Priory, which eventually brought about his downfall. The priory's debts to him began in the 1260s, but they mounted dramatically after 1271, when the prior granted him an annuity of &pound;40 to settle the house's existing debts, and agreed to a penalty charge of &pound;1 a day for late payment of the annuity. Further loans soon followed, some involving penalty and interest charges of 900 per cent per annum. By 1288, when Bermondsey presented its complaints against him to the king, Stratton held five of the priory's manors, all of its advowsons, and yet was still owed debts of &pound;6000.<br>
<br>Stratton's direct involvement with the management of the countess of Aumale's estates appears to have begun in 1274; it was probably as a reward for reorganizing her financial administration that in 1276 Isabella gave him her chamberlainship of the exchequer in fee. Between 1277 and 1286 Stratton was clearly Isabella's chief financial official, receiving, disbursing, and transferring the revenues of her estates from his London base with the help of the Riccardi. In 1279, while acting in Isabella's service, he was accused before parliament by the abbot of Quarr (Isle of Wight) of fraudulently removing the seal from an abbey charter. More allegations of dishonest conduct emerged when the king suspended him from his offices at the exchequer, and appointed special justices to hear all additional complaints against him. But despite overwhelming evidence of his guilt, Stratton was declared innocent of all charges and restored to his offices at the exchequer. In return he paid a 4000 mark bribe to the king through the Riccardi.<br>
<br>In 1289 Stratton did not escape so lightly. Bermondsey's complaints reached the king in Gascony in 1288. When Edward returned to England in late 1289, Stratton was deprived of his exchequer offices and put on trial for felony. Lurid tales of sorcery circulated about him, but the charges of which he was actually convicted in 1290 are not known. His secular property was confiscated, including cash found in his house to the value of &pound;12,666 17<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., but he retained his ecclesiastical revenues, and his friends were able to purchase the king's pardon for him by a fine of 500 marks. In early 1291, however, Stratton was again on trial for felony, this time accused of forging charters, and was once again committed to the Tower of London. Convicted near the end of 1292, he was dead by 14 August 1294, whether by execution or natural causes is nowhere recorded.<br>
