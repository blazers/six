<span class="headword">Massey family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1760&#150;1891), <span class="occ">makers of clocks, watches, and nautical instruments</span>, had as its most important member <a name="cosubject_49847"></a><span class="headword">Edward Massey junior</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1768, <em>d.</em> 1852)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized on 18 August 1768 in Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, the first of eight children of <a name="cosubject_49846"></a><span class="headword">Edward Massey senior</span>  (1740&#150;1813), <span class="occ">clock- and watchmaker</span>, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1805). He had two sisters and five brothers, three of whom died before reaching maturity. The family were Roman Catholics, and Edward senior moved to Newcastle in 1763, having served his apprenticeship elsewhere. Although declared bankrupt in 1778, he was clearly a competent and versatile mechanic who supplied tools such as cutters and Lancashire files to the pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, and maintained the machines in his factory. Edward junior was made a freeman of Newcastle on 17 March 1790, having served an apprenticeship with his father, and married Jane Roulstone (<i>d</i>. 1841) on 2 November that year. He had seven sons, all of whom became watchmakers or nautical instrument makers, and one daughter, who married William Poynter, a watch pallet jeweller and nephew of the recusant Bishop Poynter, at Prescot, Lancashire, in 1828.<br>
<br>Soon after he became a freeman of Newcastle, trade directories list Edward junior as a clock- and watchmaker in the nearby pottery towns of Burslem and Hanley, but by 1806 he had returned to Newcastle to manufacture mechanical logs and sounders, to designs patented by him in 1802 and 1806. Accounts of Massey's patent sea log and sounding machine were published in Liverpool (1805) and London (1806), and a German version was published in Danzig (1818). An important forty-one page statement &#145;of the Case of Mr Edward Massey of the City of Coventry and of Scholes near Prescot Lancashire, Most respectfully offered to the notice of every Member of Parliament&#146; was published in 1820. This contained details of the development and trials of his sounding machines and the number of machines purchased by the Navy Board, testimonies of sailors who had used the machines, and his objections to the lords commissioners of the Admiralty's discontinuing the purchase of his machines in favour of less satisfactory devices. Massey claimed that &pound;700 paid by the board of longitude and the treasurer of the navy was &#145;not equivalent to half the travelling expenses he has incurred in bringing this machine to maturity&#146;. Letters from Earl St Vincent, admiral of the British fleet, and Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, dated 1807, commend the machine, and Cotton adds that:<blockquote>Mr. Massey, having now been embarked more than two months (in consequence of the long detention of the squadron in Torbay by the westerly gales) and being very anxious to return to his wife and numerous family, I intend, in compliance with his earnest request, to send him into port by the first opportunity.</blockquote>Additional patents for nautical instruments were taken out by members of the Massey family in 1834, 1836, 1844, 1848, 1854, 1857, 1858, 1860, 1865, 1868, 1876, and 1884. These include designs for taffrail logs, electric logs, and deep-sea sounders. As well as being used by merchant and national navies throughout the world, Massey nautical instruments were used on the great early nineteenth-century voyages of discovery, by the US coast and geodetic survey, and for deep-sea sounding for the transatlantic telegraph cables, beginning in 1857.<br>
<br>The Massey family continued to develop and manufacture mechanical logs and sounders on the same basic principle until the firm was taken over by Thomas Walker &amp; Son Ltd, Birmingham, early in the twentieth century, after the death of the unmarried grandson of Edward junior, <a name="cosubject_76947"></a><span class="headword">(John) Edward Massey</span>  (1831&#150;1891)<span class="occ"></span>. Thomas Walker was reputed to be a nephew of Edward Massey.<br>
<br>Entries in London trade directories record that John Edward Massey, trading as &#145;Edward Massey, successors of the original inventor and sole manufacturer by special appointment of patent logs and sounding machines to Her Majesty's Royal Navy&#146;, received the only gold medal awarded at the International Fisheries Exhibition, London (1883), and another medal at the International Inventions Exhibition, London (1885). In 1876, following a patent taken out in 1875, he also advertised as: &#145;Stamp makers, die sinkers and engravers; sole inventors and patentees of the new post office lock stamps used for dating, defacing and impressing or any purpose requiring the secure use of movable type&#146;.<br>
<br>The younger Edward Massey was by no means the first person to have the idea of measuring the distance travelled through water by mechanically recording the revolutions of a dragged or falling vaned rotor, designed to turn at a constant rate. However, his designs were the first to produce instruments which worked well in practice and which ordinary mariners could afford to buy.<br>
<br>An interesting reference to the development of his log at Newcastle is found in the papers of the Liverpool antiquary, jeweller, and goldsmith Joseph Mayer (1803&#150;1886), who was also born and raised in Newcastle under Lyme:<blockquote>On dismissal from school almost every Saturday afternoon several of my school fellows went to the canal where opposite the Cotton Factory &hellip; Massey tried his log machine and we thought it a privilege to be allowed to trail the machines by running them along the canal.</blockquote>During this period, Edward Massey junior also developed various horological devices, and in 1808 he patented a design for an improved cock or tap. In 1803 the Society of Arts awarded him 20 guineas for the design of a clock striking train which did not use a fly, for accurate indication of time during astronomical observations, and another 50 guineas for two clock escapements. After the death of his father in 1813 he moved to Ironmonger Row, Cross Cheaping, Coventry, where he continued to manufacture logs and sounders, and to exploit the horological inventions which he patented in 1812 and 1814, especially his new design for a detached lever escapement for watches. The inventions also include a robust keyless winding mechanism and an adjustable temperature compensation curb for watches, a remontoir chronometer escapement, and a gravity escapement for a pendulum regulator clock. Entries in trade directories and an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span> for 21 April 1815 suggest that the Masseys soon concentrated on manufacturing, supplying, and fitting parts for their patented devices, rather than on manufacturing complete watches or chronometers. Coventry was an obvious place to set up such a business as it already had a reputation for exploiting apprentice labour in workshops to finish the rough movements produced in the Prescot area of Lancashire, rather than using the skilled watch finishers working in areas like Liverpool and Clerkenwell. Many watches with Massey's escapement from this early period were signed by Edward Massey, or marked &#145;Massey's Patent&#146;, but many more were signed by other manufacturers or retailers, and marked &#145;Patent Detached Lever&#146;, with escapements fitted or supplied by the Masseys.<br>
<br>Massey's version of the detached lever escapement was by far his most important contribution to horology, and exists in a number of variant forms. These, unlike the earlier versions produced by such eminent London watchmakers as Thomas Mudge and Josiah Emery, could be inexpensively produced in large numbers, and it appears that Massey was the first maker to use &#145;draw&#146; as a matter of course in his lever escapements, from around 1820. This is an escapement design feature which limits intermittent friction when a watch is carried on the person, and is essential for the satisfactory performance of lever watches. It may have been the subject of a patent applied for in 1820 for which no specification was ever filed.<br>
<br>From 1812 until the late 1840s Massey's was the dominant form of detached lever escapement used in English watches, produced in great numbers, especially by the Liverpool watchmakers. It can be seen as the precursor of both the English single table roller lever escapement and the Swiss double roller escapement, which were produced in ever greater numbers from the second half of the nineteenth century. Through the many watches exported to the USA, Massey also influenced the development of the great American watch factories. The first American machine-made watches (manufactured by H. and J. Pitkin of Hartford, Connecticut, from 1838) had a version of his escapement. The Massey design and the layout of the early Massey escapement watches can themselves be seen as a development of the rack lever watches produced in the Liverpool area following Peter Litherland's patents of 1791 and 1792.<br>
<br>By 1819 the Masseys had opened a manufactory at the Scholes, a sixteenth-century recusant house near Prescot (apparently because the skilled workmen required to develop Edward's chronometer escapements were not available in Coventry), and by 1825 another manufactory at Clerkenwell, to exploit the London market. By the early 1830s Edward and all his children were working at various addresses in the cities of London and Westminster, manufacturing patented nautical instruments, horological devices, and other items such as early fountain pens (according to designs patented in 1833 and 1834). Special items supplied by the Masseys include fast beating stopwatches (originally designed to ascertain accurately distance by sound in gunnery), and seconds beating &#145;journeyman&#146; watches (to carry the time from a fixed regulator or chronometer about an observatory or ship). Further patents for various horological devices were taken out by Edward junior in 1838 and 1841, and by his son Francis Joseph (1801&#150;1845) in 1841.<br>
<br>After trials at the Greenwich Royal Observatory in 1842, Massey's chronometer no. 1 was purchased for the Royal Navy for 50 guineas, &#145;their Lordships having been pleased in order to mark the superior performance of it to assign to it a proportionately increased price to that usually given&#146;. However, the only member of the Massey family who seems to have produced a significant number of chronometers was Edward John (1810&#150;1872), probably a nephew of Edward junior, who worked in Liverpool from the early 1830s. Edward Massey junior died at his home, 17 Chadwell Street, Clerkenwell, London, on 10 May 1852 of &#145;age and debility&#146;, and was buried at St John's Church, Duncan Terrace, Islington.<br>
<br>The Massey family enjoyed for many years a virtual monopoly of supply of logs and sounders for Royal Navy and merchant ships. Taken as a whole, their products did much to advance the arts of navigation and hydrography and thereby to improve maritime safety.<br>
