<span class="headword">Roman Britain,  British leaders in</span>  (<em>act. </em>55 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>&#150;<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 84), <span class="occ">tribal rulers</span>, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome.<h2>
<a name="TribalinstitutionsinGaulandBritain"></a>Tribal institutions in Gaul and Britain</h2>By the mid-first century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> and was to endure for another century.<br>
<br>In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers.<h2>
<a name="CassivellaunusandCommius"></a>Cassivellaunus and Commius</h2>The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4863/', "Cassivellaunus")</script>, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6030/', "Commius")</script>, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>.<br>
<br>Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing.<br>
<br>Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, <a href="#cosubject_62297">Tincommius</a>, <a href="#cosubject_62298">Eppillus</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_62299">Verica [<i>see below</i>]</a>, placed the filiation &#145;son of Commius&#146; on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain.<h2>
<a name="TheheirsofCommius"></a>The heirs of Commius</h2>The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. <a name="cosubject_62297"></a><span class="headword">Tincommius <span class="st"> [Tincomarus]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>25 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>&#150;<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 5)<span class="occ"></span> was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The <span class="italic">Res gestae</span> (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 5, after flight from Britain. <a name="cosubject_62298"></a><span class="headword">Eppillus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 5&#150;<em>c.</em>10)<span class="occ"></span> was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by <a name="cosubject_62299"></a><span class="headword">Verica</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10&#150;<em>c.</em>41)<span class="occ"></span>, whose rule extended until <span class="smallcap">AD</span> <i>c</i>.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign.<br>
<br>North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was <a name="cosubject_62300"></a><span class="headword">Addedomarus</span>  (<em>fl. </em>35 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>)<span class="occ"></span>, probably from about 35 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. <a name="cosubject_62301"></a><span class="headword">Dubnovellaunus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>30 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>)<span class="occ"></span> succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the <span class="italic">Res gestae</span> of Augustus.<br>
<br>A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. A king named <a name="cosubject_62303"></a><span class="headword">Dubnovellaunus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>40 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>)<span class="occ"></span>, earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by <a name="cosubject_62304"></a><span class="headword">Vosenius</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10)<span class="occ"></span> early in the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6939/', "Cunobelinus")</script>, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10 to about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as &#145;king of the Britons&#146;. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40.<h2>
<a name="TheRomaninvasion"></a>The Roman invasion</h2>Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43. These two, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4601/', "Caratacus")</script> and <a name="cosubject_62305"></a><span class="headword">Togodumnus</span>  (<em>d.</em> <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43)<span class="occ"></span>, had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40. A third son, <a name="cosubject_62306"></a><span class="headword">Adminius <span class="st"> [Amminius]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40)<span class="occ"></span>, controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41192/', "Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes")</script> in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces.<h2>
<a name="Cogidubnus"></a>Cogidubnus</h2>Events immediately following the Roman invasion in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48282/', "Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus)")</script>, the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable.<h2>
<a name="KingsoftheDobunni"></a>Kings of the Dobunni</h2>The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are <a name="cosubject_62309"></a><span class="headword">Corio</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 15&#150;20)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_62310"></a><span class="headword">Bodvoc</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 15&#150;20)<span class="occ"></span>. The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain.<h2>
<a name="RulersoftheIceniBoudicca"></a>Rulers of the Iceni: Boudicca</h2>In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43 and about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 50, one <a name="cosubject_62307"></a><span class="headword">Prasutagus</span>  (<em>d.</em> <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 59/60)<span class="occ"></span> became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable.<br>
<br>It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2732/', "Boudicca (Boudica)")</script>. By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the <i>colonia</i> (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world.<h2>
<a name="RulersofnorthernBritain"></a>Rulers of northern Britain</h2>Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48306/', "Venutius")</script>, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior &eacute;lite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua.<br>
<br>In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10300/', "Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4)")</script>, who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at &#145;Mons Graupius&#146;, an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after &#145;Mons Graupius&#146;, nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>.<h2>
<a name="SubRomanrulers"></a>Sub-Roman rulers</h2>After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28354/', "Vortigern")</script>, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/436/', "Ambrosius Aurelianus")</script>, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/703/', "Arthur")</script>, who must remain in the realm of myth.<br>
