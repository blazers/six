<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  George Howard</span>  (1833&#150;1907), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld, and Dunblane</span>, was born at Durham on 12 May 1833, the eldest son of George Wilkinson of Oswald House, Durham, and his wife, Mary, youngest child of John Howard of Ripon, Yorkshire. On his father's side he was from a long-established gentry family in co. Durham and Northumberland. Educated at Durham grammar school, Wilkinson went to Brasenose College, Oxford, in October 1851, but in November was elected to a scholarship at Oriel College. He obtained second-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>, graduated BA in 1855, and proceeded MA in 1859 and DD in 1883. After a year spent in travel he was ordained deacon (1857) and priest (1858) and licensed to the curacy of St Mary Abbots, Kensington, London. On 14 July 1857 he married Caroline Charlotte, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Benfield des Voeux, fourth son of Charles des Voeux, first baronet. They had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1859 Lady Londonderry, widow of the third marquess, presented Wilkinson to the living of Seaham Harbour, co. Durham, and in 1863 the bishop of Durham, C. T. Baring, appointed him vicar of Bishop Auckland in the same county. Wilkinson had been untouched at Oxford by the Tractarian movement, but during the 1860s he moved away from his moderate evangelicalism which subordinated the sacraments to personal conversion. Under the influence of Canon T. T. Carter and others he espoused Anglo-Catholicism, though he remained ambivalent about aural confession until the 1870s. Difficulties followed with the bishop, who was an evangelical. Wilkinson's health suffered from the strain, and in 1867 he accepted the incumbency of St Peter's, Great Windmill Street, London. In this small and poor parish he began to refine the basic thrusts of his very successful parochial ministry. These included open-air preaching, then a novelty; widespread involvement of laity and particularly women as district visitors responsible to the clergy; and evangelical preaching in the context of Catholic liturgy and ritual. One of the earliest to take up parochial missions, he helped to organize the innovative high-church twelve-day mission to London in 1869. During its progress he accepted the offer by Bishop John Jackson of London of St Peter's, Eaton Square. His incumbency there, beginning in January 1870, was widely known for its success in a parish which included both wealthy, influential parishioners and poorer housing areas.<br>
<br>Active in church affairs generally, Wilkinson spoke at church congresses; sought in the years of ritual trouble (1870&#150;80) to act as an interpreter between the bishops and the ritualists; and zealously advocated foreign missions, the day of intercession for which owed its establishment to him. In 1877 the bishop of Truro, E. W. Benson, made him an examining chaplain; on 6 September of the same year his wife died. In 1878 he refused to be nominated suffragan bishop for London. Select preacher at Oxford from 1879 to 1881, in 1880 he was elected a proctor in convocation and gave evidence before the royal commission of 1881 on ecclesiastical courts. In 1882 he declined an invitation from the bishop of Durham, J. B. Lightfoot, to become canon missioner.<br>
<br>In 1883, on Benson's translation to Canterbury, Gladstone appointed Wilkinson to succeed him at Truro, and he was consecrated at St Paul's on 25 April 1883. At Truro he completed the building of the cathedral and saw it consecrated on 3 November 1887, founded a sisterhood, the Community of the Epiphany, and did much for the clergy of poorer benefices. In 1885 he declined the see of Manchester. He took part in the 1888 Lambeth conference. In April 1891, after a mental collapse, he announced his resignation; he was perennially subject to depression caused by over-scrupulosity and an acute sense of sin, which existed in tension with personal vanity.<br>
<br>Restored by a visit to South Africa, Wilkinson was on 9 February 1893 elected to succeed Charles Wordsworth as bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld, and Dunblane, and was enthroned in St Ninian's Cathedral, Perth, on 27 April. In 1904 the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal church elected him primus. As a diocesan he created a fund for church extension and raised &pound;14,000 for extensions and renovations to St Ninian's Cathedral; and he fostered interest in home and foreign missions. As primus this concern became focused especially on South Africa, which he again visited. Instrumental in establishing the Episcopal church's Temperance Society, he also took the lead in working towards closer relations between the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches, but was misunderstood because of his refusal to gloss over historic differences between the two bodies. He ministered to Gladstone during the latter's terminal illness in 1898.<br>
<br>Despite his later Anglo-Catholicism, Wilkinson retained a firm belief in the need for personal conversion, which allied him with other Anglo-Catholics such as Richard Meux Benson and Charles Bodington. His Catholic evangelicalism was attested to in his many minor works of practical spirituality, including <span class="italic">Instructions in the Devotional Life</span> (1871), <span class="italic">Instructions in the Way of Salvation</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">Lent Lectures</span> (1873). One of the foremost preachers of his day, Wilkinson had a wide circle of influence which included Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Donald MacLeod, one-time moderator of the Church of Scotland, and Adeline, duchess of Balfour. He died of a heart attack at 13 Queen Street, Edinburgh, on 11 December 1907, and after funeral services at Edinburgh and Perth was buried in Brompton cemetery, London.<br>
