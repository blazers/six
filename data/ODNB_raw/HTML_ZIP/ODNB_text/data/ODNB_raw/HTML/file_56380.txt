<span class="headword">Noble,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1792), <span class="occ">publisher and proprietor of a circulating library</span>, and his brother <a name="cosubject_75459"></a><span class="headword">John Noble</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">publisher and proprietor of a circulating library</span>, are of uncertain origins. They may have been of French descent, and related to William Noble (apprentice to the London bookseller Benjamin Walford in 1709) and the bookseller S. Noble (<i>fl</i>. 1713&#150;1717), of Long Walk, Cheapside. They were certainly either the siblings or close relations of the bookseller and library proprietor Samuel Noble (<i>fl</i>. 1760&#150;1779) of Carnaby Street, of the journeyman bookseller Edward Noble (<i>d</i>. 1786), who was foreman of John Nichols, and of Drusilla, the wife of the engraver Jacob Bonneau (<i>d</i>. 1786). There is no record of their having served apprenticeships with members of the Stationers' Company. Although the Noble brothers operated on the fringe of the established book trade throughout their careers, they are noteworthy for their role in popularizing the commercial circulating library in England, and for developing an active and popular publishing programme which supplied their own and other such libraries with appropriate publications.<br>
<br>Francis opened a bookshop at the Otway's Head, St Martin's Court, Leicester Fields, London, in the autumn of 1737, and began collaborating in minor publishing ventures. He moved to larger premises in the same street about 1743, and in the same year John opened his own bookshop at Dryden's Head, also in St Martin's Court. In the winter of 1744&#150;5 the two brothers went into partnership at the new Otway's Head, where they began to advertise one of the earliest circulating libraries in London. A catalogue, <span class="italic">The Yearly and Quarterly Subscriber</span>, was produced soon afterwards, listing about 1400 titles and with an engraved frontispiece by Bonneau, depicting a library. In 1749 the partnership was ended and the brothers maintained separate businesses, though frequently collaborating with one another. Having moved to yet further premises in St Martin's Court, John resurrected his earlier trade sign and established his own bookshop and library, where he remained throughout his career. Francis stayed in their previous shop until 1752, but moved to larger premises in nearby King Street, Covent Garden. His new library was illustrated on a trade card engraved by Simon Ravenet. In 1759 he moved once again to larger premises on the south side of High Holborn, where he remained until his retirement.<br>
<br>In the years prior to his partnership Francis Noble had published more than fifty titles, usually in collaboration with other booksellers. These were mainly works of a popular nature, such as collections of tales, reprints of existing imaginative works, or else books designed for children. John began publishing similar works on his own account in 1744, but from the following year the imprint F. &amp; J. Noble begins to appear. During the five years of their partnership the rate of publishing declined, and the brothers appear to have rather concentrated upon developing their circulating library business. However, from about 1750 the brothers began once more to develop a programme of publishing popular imaginative literature, both individually and in collaboration, including authors such as Defoe, as well as a host of anonymous and pseudonymous works. Although many of their books are difficult to date accurately, there appears to have been two main periods of publishing activity: between 1754 and 1757, and between 1766 and 1773. A survey by James Raven indicates that the Noble brothers may have been &#145;responsible for a tenth of all prose fiction titles published in the 1750s and 1760s&#146;, and that &#145;over one hundred and seventy novels and fiction miscellanies (and further editions) were issued jointly for F. and J. Noble between 1744 and 1778&#146;  (Raven, 303).<br>
<br>The brothers also occasionally reissued remaindered works by other publishers and library suppliers under their own imprints. These publications were supplied in large numbers to satisfy a growing demand for such works from their own and also from other circulating libraries in London and the provinces. By the mid-1760s Francis alone claimed to hold a library stock of 20,000 volumes (although only a third as many titles), which had grown to 30,000 by 1787. Subscribers were charged half a guinea (10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.) a year and were allowed to borrow two books at a time for six days.<br>
<br>The mediocre literary quality of the Nobles' productions, combined with the undoubted success of their publishing enterprises, led to criticisms in the literary journals and among other members of the book trade. According to the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, they &#145;never paid to any author for his labour a sum equal to the wages of a journeyman taylor&#146;, and others regarded their works as formulaic and likely to debauch the young female customers of their libraries. The brothers responded to their critics in a series of advertisements appearing in their volumes, and in their <span class="italic">Appeal to the Public</span>, which accused the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> of having traduced &#145;every novel we publish, &hellip; frequently without reading them&#146;. These disputes did not damage the reputations of the brothers or the growing popularity of circulating libraries, and served rather to publicize their activities.<br>
<br>At some point Francis Noble married Ann, and the couple moved to Kentish Town, Middlesex. They had two sons, both of whom died young, and two daughters: Elizabeth married Henry Mann, and Clarissa remained unmarried. Francis retired from business in 1789&#150;90 after his daughter won a share in a &pound;30,000 state lottery prize. He died in Kentish Town in June 1792; probate of his estate was granted to his daughters on 28 June 1792, his wife having died. John Noble had retired from business in 1778, and likewise lived in Kentish Town. He died there in September 1797, apparently unmarried and without any surviving children.<br>
