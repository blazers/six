<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cochrane,  Douglas Mackinnon Baillie Hamilton</span>, twelfth earl of Dundonald  (1852&#150;1935), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Auchentoul House, Banff, on 29 October 1852, the second son (his elder brother died a baby in 1851) of Thomas Barnes Cochrane, eleventh earl of Dundonald (1814&#150;1885), army officer, and his wife, Louisa Harriet (1819/20&#150;1902), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17619/', "William Alexander Mackinnon (1784&#150;1870)")</script> of Mackinnon, tory MP and 33rd chief of clan Mackinnon, who reportedly never wore a greatcoat or flannel. He was a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5757/', "Thomas Cochrane, tenth earl of Dundonald (1775&#150;1860)")</script>, and inherited his secret chemical-warfare plans. A naval and military family, the Cochranes were within the peerage relatively poor, owning under 2000 acres in 1883.<br>
<br>Cochrane (styled Lord Cochrane 1860&#150;85) was educated at a spartan and brutal private school at Walton-on-Thames, where he learned little, and at Eton College (1866&#150;9). He had wanted to join the navy, but his parents dissuaded him as the family had suffered losses of property from Cochranes being so much away at sea. He purchased for &pound;1260 a commission as cornet and sub-lieutenant (July 1870) in the 2nd Life Guards, which his cousin Sir Roger Palmer commanded. On his extensive leaves he visited Germany, to learn the language, and South America. He was promoted lieutenant in October 1871 and captain in April 1878. He studied for Staff College entrance but did not take it because, according to his memoirs, he had to go to Brazil on family business. On 18 September 1878 he married Winifred (1858/9&#150;1924), only surviving child of Robert Bamford Hesketh, formerly 2nd Life Guards, of Gwyrch Castle, Abergele, Denbighshire, and an heiress; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Cochrane wanted to go on the 1882 Egyptian campaign but was refused. In 1884, apparently through the influence of Angela Burdett-Coutts, Baroness Burdett-Coutts, a family connection, on Wolseley, he commanded the 2nd Life Guards contingent, which formed part of the heavy camel regiment, on the Gordon relief expedition. He was helping reload a camel when a heavy box of ammunition fell on him, causing internal injury which troubled him for years. With the desert column in January 1885, he was promoted major and fought at the battles of Abu Klea and Gubat. His desert rides with dispatches on the capture of Gakdul Wells and the death of Gordon brought him fame. He succeeded to the title in January 1885. He was mentioned in dispatches, and promoted lieutenant-colonel in June 1885. In 1889 he became brevet colonel. In 1890 he was captain of the queen's guard. Troops were then intermittently used in support of the civil power, and on 7 July during a police strike Dundonald, at the request of the chief commissioner of police and cheered on by the Drury Lane audience, led the guard in clearing a mob from Bow Street: a bird-cage was thrown at his helmet and dented it.<br>
<br>From January 1895 to January 1899 Dundonald commanded the 2nd Life Guards. A keen reformer, he concentrated on improving its shooting&#151;establishing a shooting club&#151;fieldcraft, entrenching, and other dismounted action. Intelligent and innovative, he invented a light, one-horse machine-gun &#145;galloping carriage&#146;, demonstrated in 1897, for use with cavalry. The War Office rejected it but some, with Colt guns, were used by his brigade in the South African War. His other inventions included a waterproof bag for hauling men across rivers, a pneumatic-tyred light ambulance, the &#145;Instra&#146; hand-warmer, an improved teapot, and&#151;on his return from the South African War and responding to the high mortality from water-borne disease there&#151;an improved military water cart. He inspected yeomanry regiments and became convinced they should train primarily as mounted riflemen. His ceremonial duties included command of the sovereign's escort at the 1897 jubilee procession, for which he was made an MVO.<br>
<br>Dundonald's only senior command in the field was in the South African War (1899&#150;1902). Despite his aged mother's insistence that the war was unrighteous Dundonald, without an official appointment, on his own initiative went to South Africa, arriving on 14 November 1899. Sir Redvers Buller, whom he knew from the Sudan war, sent him to organize the mounted troops in south Natal. In Natal under Buller he commanded the mounted brigade, then, after reorganization at the end of January 1900, the 2nd cavalry brigade of irregular mounted infantry, and, after the relief of Ladysmith (28 February 1900) and further reorganization, the 3rd mounted brigade. On 15 December 1899 at the battle of Colenso, on the right flank, his brigade attempted to capture Hlangwane Hill, a key position. Historians differ in their versions, but some agree with Dundonald's that they might well have succeeded if Major-General Geoffry Barton had not refused the infantry reinforcement he requested. On 18 January 1900, during Sir Charles Warren's disastrous offensive, Dundonald's brigade defeated a Boer force at Acton Homes and, in &#145;a situation &hellip; capable of being turned to great strategic advantage&#146;  (Amery, 3.222) if reinforced, might have turned the Boer flank, possibly resulting in the immediate relief of Ladysmith. However Warren angrily refused reinforcements, had a stormy interview with Dundonald, and detached two regiments from Dundonald's force, preventing him from exploiting the opening his initiative had created. In February Dundonald, whose brigade formed the advance guard, was cautious in his final move towards Ladysmith, arriving after Hubert Gough who had pushed on despite contrary orders. Dundonald continued to serve in Natal and the Transvaal and, like Buller, opposed farm-burning which he believed made inveterate enemies. In October 1900 the army of Natal was broken up and, the war apparently almost over, Buller, Dundonald, and others returned home. Dundonald was promoted major-general (March 1900) and mentioned in dispatches. He later offered to go back to the war but was not asked.<br>
<br>Nicknamed &#145;Dundoodle&#146; by his colonial troops, Dundonald was, according to William Birdwood, who served on his staff, &#145;a curiously sensitive man, living largely on his nerves&#146;  (Birdwood, 100). Opinions varied on his military capacity. He was much praised by the British press, and dubbed &#145;the Stormy Petrel&#146;. However Hubert Gough, who served on his staff, came to despise him. Gough wrote in his diary, &#145;Dundonald very pleasant. He means very well but has not anything like the steady nerves a soldier wants to do any good&#146;  (Farrar-Hockley, 57), and later wrote that he was &#145;another of Buller's weak subordinates &hellip; hesitating, vacillating and vain&#146;  (Gough, 70), lacking in dash, and gaining credit for the achievements of his capable subordinates. Historians have differed in their assessments. The marquess of Anglesey concluded that &#145;on the whole he seems to have done well enough, being quick-moving and clear-headed while not interfering unduly with his subordinates &hellip; who were &hellip; men of ability&#146;  (Anglesey, 4.75). According to his admiring friend Douglas Sladen he was &#145;a tall, upright man, with an elegant figure and a handsome and very aristocratic face&#146;  (Sladen, 204), and according to Basil Collier his &#145;merits would have been more apparent to his brother-officers if he had looked less like a matin&eacute;e idol and been less of a favourite with the newspapers&#146;  (Collier, 65). The war was an important influence on his military thinking, especially on cavalry and firepower, and he long continued concerned with the war. Birdwood recalled that Dundonald when an old man &#145;devoured every book &hellip; on the South African campaign&#146;  (Birdwood, 415) and if he found any passage seeming to reflect on his own work, wanted it amended.<br>
<br>In the South African War and post-war controversy on the armament and role of cavalry Dundonald was a leading advocate of the &#145;firepower&#146; school against the &#145;arme blanche&#146; school, and was castigated by Haig. In December 1900 he became the only regular cavalryman on the War Office committee on the organization, arms, and equipment of the yeomanry. In his minority report he advocated they become rifle-armed mounted infantry and their name be changed from yeomanry cavalry to imperial yeomanry. His recommendations were essentially implemented&#151;though more because they expressed the perceived lessons of the war and because Roberts favoured them than because Dundonald advocated them&#151;but by 1914 they had been partly reversed in the cavalry traditionalist reaction: the sword was restored for war mobilization in 1913. Since before the 1884 Sudan war he had been much interested in machine-guns, and after the South African War he advocated their use in large numbers. In public speeches he advocated the auxiliary forces be reorganized into an effective second line of defence, and he privately urged Lord Roberts, the commander-in-chief, to do this.<br>
<br>In 1902 Dundonald was appointed general officer commanding (GOC) the Canadian militia. As an imperial officer with a statutory quasi-independent role, responsible to the dominion government, and so involved with Canadian politics and with Anglo-Canadian and Canadian&#150;United States relations, Dundonald, like his predecessors, had a difficult task. Like them, and most notably Edward Hutton (GOC, 1898&#150;1900), he aimed to make the militia an efficient fighting force for Canadian and imperial defence. Despite Hutton's efforts, political patronage and interference in the militia continued: an American critic had earlier described the militia as &#145;a kind of military Tammany&#146;  (Penlington, 161). Before Dundonald left, Chamberlain and others warned him of difficulties with politicians. However, he liked Canadians and he arrived in July 1902 determined to reform the militia. Energetic and enthusiastic, he planned reorganization and training, went on inspection tours, initiated affiliation of Canadian with British regiments, and encouraged the formation of cadet units and the adoption of Scottish characteristics by Canadian Scottish regiments. He re-equipped the artillery. He abolished the sword as a cavalry war weapon and wrote <span class="italic">Cavalry Training, Canada</span> (1904), stating that the rifle was &#145;the weapon for cavalry in the future&#146;  (Dundonald, 252). He advocated &#145;an economical Citizen Army&#146;, a large militia, compulsory cadet training, and preparation for possible war, and publicly stated his views in speeches at dinners and receptions. He warned Canadians on defence, that they were living in a fool's paradise, and criticized inadequate provision for the militia. There was friction with politicians, especially over their interference in officer appointments. His protests failed, so he decided to &#145;arouse the nation to the danger of practices which rendered organization useless and efficiency impossible&#146;  (ibid., 260). On 4 June 1904, at an officers' banquet in Montreal, he denounced political interference in military appointments, naming the minister of agriculture (acting minister of militia), Sydney Fisher. The &#145;Dundonald incident&#146; was much reported, and debated in the Canadian and&#151;following Lloyd George's motion criticizing Dundonald&#151;British parliaments. On 14 June he was dismissed by the Canadian government, then recalled by the British, leaving at the end of July. He was popular in Canada, and was supported by many Canadians and much applauded at farewell gatherings. He was the last imperial GOC: a new <span class="roman">Militia Act</span> stipulated a Canadian. After his departure his infantry and cavalry manuals were cancelled. He much resented Churchill, whom he had helped in South Africa, joining Lloyd George's attack.<br>
<br>In 1906 Dundonald was a member of the committee on the reorganization of the auxiliary forces appointed by Haldane. He was promoted lieutenant-general in December 1906 and was, to his &#145;astonishment and dismay&#146;  (Dundonald, 309), retired from the army in June 1907. From April 1907 to February 1919 he was colonel of the 2nd Life Guards. He helped the interests of former servicemen and particularly the new National Society of Ex-Naval and Military Men. From 1886 to 1922 Dundonald was, replacing his father, a Scottish representative peer: a Liberal Unionist who sometimes spoke on the Sudan and defence issues. In 1906 he advocated compulsory cadet training for youths. In January 1910 he spoke against Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146;, alleging its land taxes would drive capital out of the country and decrease house building. However, he was not a &#145;diehard&#146; peer. He lived at Wimbledon Park and, according to Sladen, was a &#145;lonely man who saw very little of his wife&#146;  (Sladen, 205).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 Dundonald offered his services, &#145;preferably for a command in the Field&#146;  (Dundonald, 326), and he hoped to command the Canadian contingent, but was unsuccessful. In 1915 he asked Kitchener for an appointment, but was told &#145;This is a young man's war&#146;  (ibid., 328). According to Sladen, &#145;Kitchener hated him&#146;  (Sladen, 208) and so excluded him. In 1914 he proposed the formation of a West Indian contingent, a proposal initially rejected. He decided to try to apply his grandfather's secret chemical-warfare plans to the war (unknown to Dundonald, and to his later chagrin, the plans had &#145;thoughtlessly&#146; been published by Sir George Douglas and Sir George Ramsay in their 1908 edition of <span class="italic">The Panmure Papers</span>). In September 1914 he proposed to &#145;drive the enemy from their trenches by the use of asphyxiating vapour under cover of dense smoke clouds&#146;  (ibid., 331) but Kitchener rejected this. Dundonald contacted Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, who had accompanied his brigade in South Africa. Churchill was keen (within the limits of international law), and in January 1915 advised him to confide the plans to Colonel Maurice Hankey, who had been experimenting with secret weapons. Dundonald did so &#145;under the seal of strictest secrecy&#146;  (Hankey, 1.230), and also made private experiments. In March Churchill appointed an Admiralty committee on smoke screens, chaired by Dundonald, which did useful work. Smoke screens were used by British sea and land forces, but Dundonald considered they were insufficiently used and could have changed the Gallipoli campaign.<br>
<br>Dundonald was appointed CB in May 1896, MVO in June 1897, CVO in June 1907, and KCB in 1913. In 1921 he was special ambassador at the Peruvian centenary. The countess of Dundonald took a great interest in the Anglican church in Wales, especially at the time of the disestablishment controversy. She died on 17 January 1924, and the archbishop of Wales officiated at her funeral (at Llanddulas parish church, north Wales, 19 January). She bequeathed &pound;50,000 and a balance of her Gwyrch Castle estate to George V for establishing a royal residence in Wales. The king declined, so the bequests passed to the order of St John of Jerusalem, from which Dundonald bought the castle and estate.<br>
<br>Despite his earlier injury, Dundonald remained active into old age. In 1926 he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">My Army Life</span> (augmented edition, 1934), which included his criticism of government departments' abuse of the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> to conceal information about themselves unconnected with national security. In 1930, aged seventy-seven he, with a small crew, sailed his 14 ton yawl-rigged yacht, <i>Bonnie Joann</i>, to Brazil. He died at his residence, Fernwood, Victoria Road, Wimbledon Park, Surrey, on 12 April 1935; his funeral was at Achnaba church, Argyll, on 16 April. He was succeeded as thirteenth earl by his elder son, Thomas Hesketh Douglas Blair Cochrane (1886&#150;1958).<br>
