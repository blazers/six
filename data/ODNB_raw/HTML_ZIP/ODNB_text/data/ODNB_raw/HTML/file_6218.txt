<span class="headword">Cooper,  George</span>  (1820&#150;1876), <span class="occ">organist</span>, was born on 7 July 1820 at Lambeth, London. His father, also named George Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1843), was assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral. Cooper's early proficiency, arising from assiduous practice on an old pedal harpsichord, came to the notice of Thomas Attwood, the chief organist of the cathedral, who on several occasions made him extemporize at the festivals of the Sons of the Clergy. On one such occasion he is said to have earned the praise of Mendelssohn. At the age of eleven the younger George Cooper often took the service instead of his father, and in 1834 he received the appointment of organist of St Benet Paul's Wharf. Two years later he became organist of St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate, and on Attwood's death, in March 1838, he succeeded his father as assistant organist of St Paul's Cathedral. His father, who had resigned at that time, died in 1843, on which occasion Cooper also obtained his post at St Sepulchre's. In the same year he was appointed singing master and organist to Christ's Hospital. In September 1856 he became organist of the Chapel Royal, in succession to J. B. Sale, who had just died. This appointment, together with those at St Paul's, St Sepulchre's, and Christ's Hospital, he retained until his death.<br>
<br>Cooper published a book of <span class="italic">Organ Arrangements</span>, an <span class="italic">Organist's Assistant</span>, an <span class="italic">Introduction to the Organ</span>, and an <span class="italic">Organist's Manual</span> (1851). In 1862 he revised the music for W. Windle's <span class="italic">Church and Home Metrical Psalter and Hymn Book</span>, contributing several tunes of his own. On the death of Henry John Gauntlett in February 1876 he undertook to complete the musical editing of <span class="italic">Wesley's Hymns</span>. He had finished the task by the time of his death, but the book appeared posthumously in 1877. Cooper died at his home at 14 Heathcote Street, Mecklenburg Square, London, on 2 October 1876. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor Cooper.<br>
