<span class="headword">Seymour,  Michael Hobart</span>  (1800&#150;1874), <span class="occ">anti-Catholic polemicist</span>, was born on 29 September 1800 at Limerick, the sixth son of John Crossley Seymour (<i>d</i>. 1831), vicar of Caherelly, and Catherine, eldest daughter and coheir of the Revd Edward Wight, rector of Meelick in co. Limerick. He claimed to be the lineal descendant of Sir Henry Seymour, brother of Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25155/', "Aaron Crossley Hobart Seymour")</script> was his brother. In 1823 he graduated BA from Trinity College, Dublin, and proceeded MA in 1832. He was ordained deacon in 1823 and priest in 1824. He served as a clergyman in Ireland, and also as secretary to the Irish Protestant Association, tirelessly campaigning against the dogmas and practices of the Roman Catholic church. He left Ireland, where he had become unpopular, for England about 1834. In London he was for several years evening lecturer at St George the Martyr, Southwark, and afternoon lecturer at St Ann Blackfriars while also acting as travelling secretary for the Reformation Society. In January 1844 Seymour married, at Walcot church, Bath, Maria, only daughter of General Thomas of the East India Company and widow of Baron Brownmill, physician to Louis XVIII. They had no children. For the next thirty years of his life he made Bath his permanent place of residence and ceased to hold any post in the church.<br>
<br>In September 1844 Seymour and his wife took a long journey to Rome, which he described in his controversial <span class="italic">A Pilgrimage to Rome</span> (1848) and <span class="italic">Mornings among the Jesuits at Rome: being notes of conversations held with certain Jesuits in that city</span> (1849). The first book was criticized in <span class="italic">A Brief Review by A. M.</span> (1849) and the second in <span class="italic">The Rambler</span> (4, 1849, 144&#150;9). Seymour had a rhetorical way of marshalling his facts, and his deductions could not always be relied upon. He followed up his attack in <span class="italic">Evenings with the Romanists: with an introductory chapter on the moral results of the Romish system</span> (1854), which was republished in New York and Philadelphia in 1855 and translated into Spanish, finding a large circulation in Mexico. Seymour frequently contributed anti-Catholic pieces to newspapers, and continued to publish pamphlets and lectures against the church of Rome. A lecture on nunneries, published in 1852, involved him in a controversy with Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, who published a reply. Seymour also brought out a popular new edition of Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments of the Church</span> (that is, the book of martyrs) in 1838, which purported to be &#145;carefully revised, corrected, and condensed&#146;; this was widely circulated and often reprinted during the Victorian period.<br>
<br>Seymour died at his home, 27 Marlborough Buildings, Bath, on 19 June 1874, and was buried at Locksbrook cemetery, Bath, on 25 June; his wife survived him. He was remembered for his fluency of speech and quick humour as well as for his polemical writings.<br>
