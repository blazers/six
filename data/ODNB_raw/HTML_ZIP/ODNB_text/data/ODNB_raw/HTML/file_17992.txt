<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mansell, Sir  Robert</span>  (1570/71&#150;1652), <span class="occ">naval officer and administrator</span>, was the fourth, or possibly the sixth, son of Sir Edward Mansell (1530/31&#150;1585) of Margam, Glamorgan, and Lady Jane Somerset, the youngest daughter of Henry, second earl of Worcester, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Anthony Browne. A student at Staple Inn in 1585, he attended Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1587, but did not graduate.<h2>
<a name="Maritimeexploits"></a>Maritime exploits</h2>In 1591 Mansell captained a privateer on an expedition to the West Indies led by Thomas, Lord Howard, to whom he was related by marriage through his nephew, Sir Lewis Mansell. Within a few years he had married Elizabeth, daughter of the late lord keeper, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1002/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon")</script>, and widow of Sir Francis Wyndham (<i>d</i>. 1592), a Norfolk squire whose property lay at Pentney, about 8 miles from King's Lynn. This union, which proved childless, connected him to the influential Gawdy and Bacon families, and led in 1593 to his appointment to the Norfolk bench. However, he did not settle himself in the county but instead embarked upon a naval career. During the Cadiz expedition of 1596 he rose to the command of a royal warship after the previous captain was killed, and received a knighthood from the earl of Essex (27 June). In the following year he served as Essex's flag captain on the Islands' voyage, and then as vice-admiral in the narrow seas. Between February and October 1599 he was admiral of a small squadron on the Irish station, and saw action against the rebels at Waterford. In 1600 he belatedly attempted to develop his standing in Norfolk, where he was regarded as an outsider. On 24 April he was appointed the county's vice-admiral, and later that year he offered himself as knight of the shire for the parliament which was soon expected to meet. However, his hopes of representing his county were jeopardized by a duel with Sir John Heydon on 9 October 1600, which also cost him the use of his right arm and, briefly, his place on the bench. After helping to round up the accomplices of the rebellious earl of Essex in February 1601, Mansell served as admiral of a squadron in the western channel, capturing six Hanseatic vessels laden with Portuguese merchandise. He failed to overcome the damage done to his reputation by his earlier duel, and in the parliamentary election for Norfolk held on 5 October he was defeated. However, four days later he was chosen as senior burgess at King's Lynn. He made only a modest impact on the 1601 parliament.<br>
<br>During the closing years of Elizabeth's reign Mansell served as admiral of the narrow seas. In September 1602 he performed a notable service when he intercepted six Spanish galleys, driving them into the hands of a waiting Dutch squadron, which destroyed them. On the accession of James I he signalled his desire to give over his employment at sea in favour of &#145;some place of attendance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 15.43). He achieved his ambition in April 1604 when, aided by his distant relative Lord Admiral Nottingham, and the surveyor of the navy, Sir John Trevor, his associate in a recent privateering venture, he displaced Sir Fulke Greville as treasurer of the navy. About the same time he was also made a gentleman of the privy chamber. As treasurer Mansell proved keen to enrich himself at the government's expense. Corruption was allowed to flourish at every level while he himself regularly exacted exorbitant fees from the navy's suppliers as a condition of payment. In 1605 he hired to the crown the <i>Resistance</i>, a new ship of about 140 tons of which he was a part owner, for service as a victualler in the fleet which accompanied Nottingham on the latter's embassy to Spain that year. Although equipped at government expense, the ship's true cargo was 50 tons of lead, which it carried on behalf of a private merchant. Moreover, her hire was paid on the false basis that she was a ship of 300 tons, and none of her rigging, worth &pound;379, was ever returned to the navy's stores. By such underhand means Mansell amassed a fortune, so enabling him to invest in various enterprises such as the Muscovy Company. His fraudulent dealings were exposed in 1608&#150;9 by the commission appointed to investigate corruption in the navy, but although the evidence against him was damning he went unpunished.<h2>
<a name="Navaladministrator"></a>Naval administrator</h2>During the first Jacobean parliament (1604&#150;10) Mansell acted as a spokesman for the navy. He represented Carmarthenshire, where he apparently leased some property. In 1605, while parliament was prorogued, he accompanied Nottingham to Madrid, and in the following year, during a further prorogation, he commanded the fleet which returned the Danish king, Christian IV, to his native country. By 1610 Mansell had been drawn into the circle of those who advised the young Prince Henry. Improbable though it may seem, Henry hoped to enlist Mansell in a campaign of naval reform, while Mansell supported the prince's bid to discover a north-west passage. It was probably Mansell who suggested that the expedition to find the passage should be commanded by his own nephew, Sir Thomas Button. Henry's sudden death in November 1612 deprived Mansell of his patron. In February 1613 Mansell staged a mock sea-fight to celebrate the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to the elector palatine, a project over which he took great care. Three months later he was imprisoned in the Marshalsea after he had advised Nottingham to question the legality of a second commission of inquiry into the navy. The immediate cause of his incarceration, however, was his refusal to identify the lawyer whose advice he had solicited. On 12 June he was arraigned before the privy council where he confessed his fault, avoiding the sort of intemperate outburst to which he was prone. Soon after his release he attached himself to the royal favourite, Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, whose agent he was in the parliamentary elections of 1614. He was again returned for Carmarthenshire, and also at Harwich, in recognition of his support for its bid for local admiralty jurisdiction. Mansell plumped for the county seat and again acted as the navy's spokesman.<br>
<br>Mansell was unaffected by the fall of Somerset in 1615. In that year he expanded his commercial interests by obtaining the monopoly on glass production, buying out the other members of a syndicate to which he belonged. To cut production costs he reorganized the works, but his search for a suitable site for a new furnace outside London proved ruinously expensive. Attempts to establish works in Nottinghamshire, Dorset, and Pembrokeshire all ended in failure, and by the time he discovered the ideal location at Newcastle upon Tyne he had expended &pound;28,000, &#145;almost to the exhausting of all his estate&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 12496, fol. 165). The cost of financing the glassworks may have been one of the considerations which induced Mansell in the spring of 1618 to sell the treasurership of the navy to a fellow Muscovy merchant, Sir William Russell. However, his main motive was undoubtedly that he had learned that a further investigation of the navy was now inevitable, allied to which it was clear that the power of his patrons, the Howards, was on the verge of collapse. Before Mansell agreed to sell the treasurership, he sought appointment as lieutenant of the admiralty. This office, which would allow him to retain his links with the navy, was also known as the vice-admiralty of England. Though little more than a sinecure, in status it ranked second only to that of lord admiral. It was duly conferred on Mansell in May 1618 by the young marquess of Buckingham, whom Mansell encouraged to seek appointment as lord admiral in succession to Nottingham. It seems likely that the main reason Buckingham lent his support was that Nottingham made Mansell's appointment a condition of his own resignation.<br>
<br>Over the next few years Mansell was questioned by the newly appointed navy commissioners regarding his accounts as treasurer, many of which he had failed to submit. A clause in his grant of the lieutenancy stipulated that he could not be dismissed for any offences he had previously committed, but he enjoyed no immunity from financial liability for any irregularities which the commissioners might expose. His response to the commissioners' demands was to present them with a bill for travelling expenses amounting to &pound;10,000, which he alleged he had incurred as treasurer. This evidently achieved the desired result, as the commissioners, faced with such an enormous sum, discontinued their investigation, and Mansell's accounts were not finally declared until 1639. Mansell's victory over the commissioners coincided with his appointment in 1620 as admiral of a fleet which was charged by Buckingham, the new lord admiral, to suppress the pirate base at Algiers and free the prisoners held there. The fleet anchored off Algiers on 27 November and after some negotiation forty English captives were released. These, it was maintained, were all that they had, but though Mansell was aware that this was false, his crews were sick and his ships short of supplies. He therefore retired to Spain, returning to Algiers in May 1621. On 24 May he sent five or six fireships into the harbour, though only two of the corsairs' vessels were destroyed. Before Mansell could undertake a fresh assault he was recalled, as it was thought that his ships might be needed in the channel against the Dutch in the dispute triggered by repeated acts of violence against the English in the East Indies.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarycareer"></a>Parliamentary career</h2>During his absence in the Mediterranean Mansell's glass monopoly was condemned by parliament, despite the best efforts of his second wife, whom he had married on 11 March 1617. This was Elizabeth Roper (<i>d</i>. 1658), formerly his mistress and a maid of honour to the late Anne of Denmark. His grant was accordingly revoked in May 1623, but the privy council, noting that Mansell was &#145;a well deserving servant to his majesty&#146; who had been &#145;abused in that business&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1621&#150;3</i>, 406&#150;7), immediately awarded him a fresh patent on terms almost identical to the first. This new grant came under parliamentary attack in 1624, but this time Mansell was himself in the Commons, as knight of the shire for Glamorgan. He obtained an exemption for his patent from the <span class="roman">Act of Monopolies</span>, possibly because the Commons valued his views on the feasibility and cost of the forthcoming war with Spain, about which he spoke at length on 11 and 19 March. The government, too, held his long naval service in high regard, and before the parliament was adjourned Mansell was appointed to a newly established council of war. However, he soon grew disenchanted with the council's proceedings and in February 1625 he withdrew from its meetings.<br>
<br>Mansell bore one of the flags at the funeral of King James in May 1625. Returned for Glamorgan to the 1625 parliament, he took little part in its proceedings until 10 August, when, at the invitation of Sir Robert Phelips, he alleged that the council of war had not been properly consulted about strategic matters. Over the next couple of days he bitterly criticized the conduct of Buckingham as lord admiral. Not only had Buckingham ignored Mansell's advice, but he had chosen incompetent commanders for the king's ships and had left the narrow seas without adequate defence. Not surprisingly, his sharp outbursts caused him to be arraigned before the privy council on 14 August. In the event he was treated leniently, presumably because many of the duke's enemies were then present, among them the lord chamberlain, the earl of Pembroke, who by the beginning of the new year had enlisted Mansell in his power struggle with Buckingham. It was Pembroke's agent, William Coryton, who secured Mansell's return to parliament for Lostwithiel in January 1626. During the course of this parliament Mansell was prevented by his colleagues on the council of war from speaking openly regarding the advice that they had given to Buckingham, but he nevertheless renewed his former assault on the duke, whom he lambasted for having lent the French a number of ships the previous year and for failing to guard the narrow seas. Moreover, he supported the house's efforts to impeach Buckingham, and on 9 May he called for the duke to be imprisoned. There was now no possibility that he would escape punishment for his hostility to Buckingham, and on 3 May he was removed from the council of war. On 8 July, following the dissolution, he was also dismissed from the commissions of the peace for Norfolk and Kent.<br>
<br>These punishments, and the <i>rapprochement</i> between Pembroke and Buckingham effected after the 1626 parliament was dissolved, may have persuaded Mansell to moderate his criticism of the duke in the 1628 assembly, in which he again represented Glamorgan. Although he remained critical of the conduct of the war, which had been widened to include France, he was careful not to single out Buckingham for blame, and in early July, during the interval between parliamentary sessions, Mansell was reconciled with Buckingham after a two-hour meeting. This accommodation, which led to his restoration to the Kent commission of the peace, encouraged Mansell to hope that he would now be permitted to take a more active role in naval affairs, but this expectation was soon dashed. In the following month Buckingham was assassinated and his place taken by admiralty commissioners, among whom was Mansell's sworn enemy, Sir John Coke. Over the next ten years Mansell's naval duties were largely limited to the naming and launching of new ships, although he was consulted in 1633 over the size of the manning establishment and in 1635 over the proposed dimensions for the <span class="italic">Sovereign of Seas</span>. By the time the admiralty commissioners were replaced by the earl of Northumberland in April 1638, Mansell was in his late sixties and recovering from a mild stroke, which had left him temporarily paralysed down one side. It was because of his age that in June 1642 the king refused to entrust to him the task of seizing control of the Channel Fleet from the admiral appointed by parliament.<br>
<br>Mansell's Newcastle glassworks were disrupted by the English defeat at Newburn in August 1640, when many of his workmen fled south in fear of the victorious Scots. Later that year Mansell, who presumably feared a renewed assault in parliament on his glass monopoly, canvassed his neighbours in Kent (where he had been living since at least 1626) for a county seat in the Long Parliament, but he was obliged to abandon his candidacy for lack of support. Mansell's patent was subsequently challenged in a petition to the House of Lords in May 1641. While waiting to give evidence to the house, Mansell witnessed members of the Commons fleeing in panic after mistaking the sound of a board breaking for an explosion; though he drew his sword and cried &#145;stand for shame&#146;  (Fletcher, 27) he proved unable to stem the exodus. He was finally forced to surrender his glass patent in June 1642 after a London merchant complained that some of his chests of imported glass had been seized by Mansell, though this did not prevent him from continuing to manufacture glass.<br>
<br>Mansell played no active part in the civil war. The parish register of St Alfege, in East Greenwich, where he lived, indicates that he was buried on 21 August 1652, so it is difficult to explain why licences to export horses were issued in his name in October 1655. He died childless and intestate, letters of administration being granted on 26 June 1656 to his widow, who died in 1658. As a director of the New England Company in 1622 Mansell had sponsored the discovery of Mount Mansell, but his attempt to leave his mark on the map of North America was thwarted by Champlain, who subsequently renamed the mountain Mount Desert.<br>
