<span class="headword">Ashurst,  Elizabeth Ann <span class="st"> [Eliza]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1814&#150;1850), <span class="occ">translator and campaigner for women's rights and against slavery</span>, was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/785/', "William Henry Ashurst (bap. 1791?, d. 1855)")</script>, of Muswell Hill, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (<i>d</i>. 1854). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59172/', "Matilda Biggs")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56461/', "Caroline Stansfeld")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50085/', "Emilie Venturi")</script> were her sisters. The family were Unitarians and Ashurst senior, a successful lawyer, was a supporter of radical causes, in particular the anti-slavery movement and the campaign for the rights of women. His four daughters were encouraged to be independent and politically minded women. With their parents and brother William (1819&#150;1879) they achieved collective notoriety as the &#145;clan&#146; or the &#145;Muswell Hill brigade&#146;.<br>
<br>In her youth Eliza helped her father's anti-slavery efforts, met the American abolitionists Lucretia Mott and W. L. Garrison, and attended the world anti-slavery convention held in London in June 1840. Her feminism was stirred by the treatment of the female abolitionists, who were not allowed to participate in the convention's proceedings, and was further stimulated by the novels of George Sand, which were read avidly in the original French by all the Ashurst sisters during the 1830s. Sand's passionate treatment of sexual relations, her criticism of the marriage laws, and her questioning of orthodox views on the role of women in society powerfully influenced Eliza, who became a disciple of the French novelist. She conceived a plan to emulate Sand as a professional woman of letters&#151;initially by bringing Sand's work to a wider British audience. In the early 1840s she translated Sand's <span class="italic">Spiridion</span> and in 1844 she published <span class="italic">The Mosaic Workers</span> together with <span class="italic">The Orco: a Tradition</span> in Clarke's <span class="roman">Cabinet Series</span>&#151;considered one of the more successful among the early translations of Sand's work.<br>
<br>In July 1844 Eliza began a close friendship with the Italian republican exile Giuseppe Mazzini, then living in London. Jane Carlyle, who had known Mazzini since the 1830s, noted that he had<blockquote>got up to the ears in a good twadly family of the name of Ashurst&#151;who have plenty of money&#151;and help &#145;his things&#146; and toady him till I think it has rather gone to his head. A Miss Eliza Ashurst&#151;who does strange things&#151;made his acquaintance first&#151;by going to his house to drink tea with him all alone etc., etc. (Thomson, 35)</blockquote>Mazzini's correspondence with Eliza was intensely emotional, and there were rumours of a sexual relationship. Mazzini held back from any suggestion of marriage&#151;he wrote to her in August or early September 1846:<blockquote>Alas! for all plans! Yours is a kind and beautiful one; but it cannot be realised &hellip; Build never up plans with me and for my benefit &hellip; Be good and kind and friendly and sisterly, if you can and if I deserve it &hellip; but leave [<i>sic</i>] future in the dark and never attempt to lift its veil or conquer it. (<span class="italic">Mazzini's Letters to an English Family</span>, 1.36)</blockquote>Eliza sent Mazzini copies of her translations and, being a friend and admirer of Sand, he encouraged her to continue with this work. This led on to a larger scheme to translate all Sand's novels under the general editorship of Matilda M. Hays, a feminist colleague of Eliza's. In 1847 she contributed to this series translations with the titles of <span class="italic">Andre</span>, <span class="italic">The Mosaic Workers</span> (reissued together with <span class="italic">Franchette</span> in one volume), and <span class="italic">Letters of a Traveller</span>, to which Mazzini provided an introduction. In support of this venture Mazzini also acted as a go-between with Sand by passing on drafts of the translated work; he also wrote several review articles in the radical press. But the sales were disappointing and the project was discontinued after six volumes had been published.<br>
<br>In April 1848 Eliza Ashurst wrote to Sand proposing to visit France, to which Sand responded positively. Eliza expressed support for the recent political uprising in Paris and passed on an offer of financial assistance from her father for Sand's short-lived political weekly <span class="italic">La Cause du Peuple</span>. She also sought (and was granted) an authorization from Sand on behalf of the latter's friend and political ally Louis Blanc, then a member of the provisional government, to translate one of his works into English. The result may have been <span class="italic">The Organization of Labour</span>, published in London in 1848 by H. G. Clark &amp; Co., with an anonymous translator. By the time of her arrival in Paris in mid-July 1848, events had moved on and the cause of a radical socialist republic had been lost. Sand wrote in dismay to her friend Charlotte Marliani, with whom Eliza was staying in Paris, &#145;How did Miss Ashurst arrive in the middle of this tragedy? Poor child &hellip; she arrived too late, she won't have seen the republic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondance</span>, 8.545).<br>
<br>Eliza finally met Sand face to face during a visit to Nohant in mid-September, but the 33-year-old disciple made an ambivalent impression. The more worldly and experienced Frenchwoman was taken aback by her strident feminism, and wrote to Mazzini on 30 August 1848:<blockquote>I'm afraid that reading my novels hasn't done her any good and has helped, to some extent, to make her take off in a direction totally alien to me. <i>Man</i> and <i>Woman</i> are everything for her and the question of sex &hellip; wipes out for her the idea of the human being. The effect on her of this preoccupation is a sort of state of hysteria, of which she is unaware, but which lays her open to be taken in by the first rascal that comes along. (Thomson, 36)</blockquote>Sand's words came to be seen as prophetic. In late November 1848 she informed Mazzini that Eliza had introduced her to a &#145;very common man&#146;, Jean Bardonneau, whom she was shortly to marry, a Parisian dealer in secondhand goods, &#145;whose profession &hellip;, physiognomy and language promise nothing which would be in harmony with the intelligence and sophistication of this girl&#146;  (letter of 22 Nov 1848, <span class="italic">Correspondance</span>, 8.716). Her family did not take the news well and a period of estrangement followed. After her marriage she remained in Paris and suffered a miscarriage. Pregnant once more, she returned in July 1850 to London, where a rapprochement of sorts was achieved.<br>
<br>But tragedy followed Eliza's return to France. She died following the still birth of her child at four o'clock in the morning on 25 November 1850. Caroline and William Ashurst rushed to Paris, where recriminations arose from the manner and place of her burial. Mazzini wrote to her younger sister Emilie at Genoa, &#145;I knew of the grave and of all that you write. &hellip; I cannot forgive that last act of paltriness &hellip; To me that marriage has been a silent, perennial cause of antagonism, and morally or physically I knew it would be her ruin&#146;  (letter of 1 Jan 1851, <span class="italic">Mazzini's Letters to an English Family</span>, 1.185&#150;6). Several months later her body was returned to Britain and buried in the family vault at Highgate cemetery.<br>
