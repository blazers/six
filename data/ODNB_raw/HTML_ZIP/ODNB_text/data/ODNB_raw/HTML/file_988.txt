<span class="headword">Bacon,  Anthony</span>  (1558&#150;1601), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was the fourth of five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1002/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510&#150;1579)")</script>, administrator, of Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, and the first with his second wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1610) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/987/', "Bacon, Anne")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke")</script> of Gidea Hall, Essex, and his wife, Anne. Through the marriages of his mother's sisters he was nephew to Sir Henry Killigrew, Sir Thomas Hoby, and, most significantly, to Elizabeth I's secretary of state and later lord treasurer, William Cecil, Lord Burghley. He grew up with his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/990/', "Sir Francis Bacon")</script>, possibly with his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/989/', "Sir Edward Bacon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Bacon, Sir Nathaniel")</script>], and with five sisters, at his parents' Hertfordshire estate of Gorhambury, tutored by John Walsall. Two other half-brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Sir Nathaniel Bacon")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1003/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon")</script>. From April 1573 Anthony and Francis studied for three years at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the master, John Whitgift, without graduating. From an early age, Anthony was prone to ill health: he recovered from a dangerous fever in 1560; Francis's earliest extant letter in 1574 attributes his brother's absence from Cambridge to his &#145;sore eyes&#146;, and Whitgift's accounts record moneys paid &#145;for Anthony being sick&#146;  (Jardine and Stewart, 37). These early illnesses were to become habitual and impact deeply on his career.<br>
<br>Anthony Bacon was admitted to Gray's Inn on 27 June 1576, studying under Richard Barker; his correspondence from the period shows an interest in the puritan Thomas Cartwright's writings against his erstwhile tutor Whitgift, an interest encouraged by his zealously nonconformist mother. Following his father's death in February 1579, and a bitter fight with his elder half-brothers, Bacon inherited estates worth &pound;360 per annum, and the reversion of Gorhambury on his mother's death (she outlived him by nine years). An earlier attempt to marry him profitably had failed, and now at twenty-one, with personal assets that he could mortgage, he decided to go abroad. In December 1579, armed with letters of recommendation from Burghley and the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, seigneur de Mauvissi&egrave;re, he set off to Paris, where he began to provide intelligence reports for Burghley and Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, and made a lifelong friend and correspondent in the latter's secretary, Nicholas Faunt. From Paris he moved on to Bourges, but, unable to reconcile himself to the strong Catholic faith of the city, he headed for the Calvinist republic of Geneva in the summer of 1581, lodging with Th&eacute;odore Beza, who dedicated the French publication of his meditations on the penitential psalms to Bacon's mother &#145;for my sake&#146;  (LPL, MS 659, fol. 24).<br>
<br>Over the following years, Bacon frequently lost contact with England, citing illness; Walsingham rightly blamed his incapacity on an over-dependence on &#145;physic&#146;, and advised him, &#145;you shall find in time many incommodities, if you do not in time break it off&#146;  (LPL, MS 647, art. 52). Having spent time in Lyons, Montpellier, Toulouse, and Marseilles, in November 1583 Bacon travelled to Bordeaux, where he met the essayist Michel de Montaigne; there, at the request of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, he performed certain business for the queen: she welcomed &#145;so good a man as you to have and receive letters by&#146;  (LPL, MS 647, art. 75). At the same time, however, Bacon was fighting accusations that &#145;my lodging was charged to be the receptacle of all rebellious Huguenots&#146;, and was ill again with a persistent quartain ague. Moving on to Bearn, he was befriended by the theologian Lambert Daneau, who dedicated his commentary on the minor prophets to him. Elizabeth sanctioned his continued stay in France, using him as an unofficial contact with the Huguenot leader Henri of Navarre. By October 1584, Bacon was established in the Huguenot stronghold of Montauban, embraced by Navarre's court, including the poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas. However, he gained an enemy in the wife of Henri's counsellor Philippe Duplessis Mornay when he refused to support her fight to wear wigs in church, and then rebuffed the prospect of marrying her daughter. His position deteriorated during 1585 and 1586, when Montauban was in desperate straits; in the heightened atmosphere of suspicion, Bacon and one of his pages were accused of sodomy, a capital offence. Details are sketchy: interrogations took place in August 1586 and November 1587, and Bacon may have been tried, because Navarre certainly intervened to commute a sentence against him, although this may have related to his debt problems. None of this was known in England, where Bacon's failure to return was regarded with increasing anger. One messenger, the Catholic Thomas Lawson, was gaoled by Burghley; the next, Captain Francis Allen, was subjected to a tirade by Lady Bacon, who called her elder son &#145;a traitor to God and your country&#146;  (LPL, MS 647, art. 121).<br>
<br>In 1590 Bacon returned to Bordeaux, where he engaged in a merchants' controversy, renewed his acquaintance with Montaigne (sending one of the last known letters to the writer), and befriended the imprisoned Catholic double agent Anthony Standen. Hearing of this, Lady Bacon claimed that he was &#145;illegitimate and not to be born of her body&#146;  (LPL, MS 648, art. 51) and encouraged his brother to shun him. But when he finally returned home in February 1592 after a twelve-year absence, Francis welcomed him into his Gray's Inn lodgings. Anthony had hoped to profit from his long-standing intelligence service to his uncle Burghley, but soon found that path blocked, receiving instead only such fair words as:<blockquote>make fools fain, and yet even in these no offer or hopeful assurance of real kindness, which I thought I might justly expect at the Lord Treasurer's hands, who had inned my ten years' harvest into his own barn without any halfpenny charge. (LPL, MS 648, fols. 23<i>r</i>&#150;26<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Bacon's relations with Burghley and his cousin Sir Robert Cecil remained strained; an attempt in late 1596 by his aunt Lady Russell, wife of Sir John Russell of Blackfriars, London, to smooth matters over failed to help.<br>
<br>This rejection paved the way for Bacon's future life path. Francis Bacon introduced him to his own patron, Elizabeth's controversial favourite, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. Anthony Bacon soon enhanced Essex's remarkable secretariat by co-ordinating (unpaid) a massive foreign intelligence operation with contacts across Europe, including Thomas Bodley, Sir Thomas Chaloner, Dr Henry Hawkins, John Napier, Sir Anthony Sherley, and Standen. A good quantity of his correspondence is extant at Lambeth Palace Library and formed the basis of Thomas Birch's once standard history of Elizabeth's reign.<br>
<br>Bacon shuttled between Gray's Inn, the Bacon estates at Gorhambury and Redbourn, Hertfordshire, and his brother's estate at Twickenham, Middlesex, but he was increasingly incapacitated by the stone and gout (affecting his hands, ankles, and feet) which prevented him from ever attending on the queen. A final attempt in October 1593 to travel the few miles from Twickenham to the court at Windsor had to be abandoned at Eton. As Essex's nominee, he was returned as MP for Wallingford, Berkshire, in 1593 and Oxford, in 1597, but, even if he attended, he made no impact on either parliament. Bowing to Essex's desire to have him nearer at hand, in May 1594 he bought a London house in the disreputable Bishopsgate Street, much to his mother's concern: she complained that the presence of nearby Butt Inn with its &#145;continual interludes had even infected the inhabitants there with corrupt &amp; lewd dispositions&#146;  (LPL, MS 650, art. 114). Her passions were similarly roused by Anthony's acquaintance with the urbane Spanish politician Antonio P&eacute;rez, who moved into Essex's circle and became a close friend: &#145;I would you were well rid of that old, dooted, polling papist. He will use discourses out of season to hinder your health, the want whereof is your great hindrance&#146;  (LPL, MS 653, art. 77). Worse was Bacon's decision in 1596 to move into the earl's residence, Essex House on the Strand. &#145;You have hitherto been esteemed as a worthy friend&#146;, she wrote, &#145;now shall be accounted his follower &hellip; brought as it were into a kind of bondage&#146;  (LPL, MS 651, art. 210). Above all, Lady Bacon disapproved of what she considered her son's profligate spending: on his return to England, completely penniless, he had been forced to sell certain of his manors, and was to spend the rest of his life involved in complex debt arrangements.<br>
<br>In his final years, Bacon was almost certainly housebound but he maintained his powerful position at the heart of Essex's intelligence operations: Henry Wotton (a member of Essex's secretariat) described him as &#145;a gentleman of impotent feet, but a nimble head &hellip; being of a provident nature &hellip; and well knowing the advantage of a dangerous secret&#146;  (Wotton, 13). His intimacy and influence with Essex also aroused suspicions: Wotton alleged that Bacon extorted money from the earl by threatening to betray his secrets, a charge that is not repeated or supported elsewhere. Bacon's activities between 1597 and 1601, the turbulent period during which Essex fell from favour several times and controversially led English forces in Ireland, are difficult to reconstruct, since his papers from this period have been lost or, more likely, destroyed. While Essex was in Ireland in 1599, Bacon had a disagreement with his steward, Gelly Merrick; later, there was unsubstantiated gossip that the earl had given Essex House to Bacon in lieu of a cash sum owed to him. Certainly, Bacon remained in Essex House until Elizabeth ordered him and others to leave in March 1600; however, when Essex attempted his rebellion in February 1601, he was apparently not involved; he was not called to give evidence. By then, living on Crutched Friars in London, he was terminally ill: the date of his death is unknown, but he was buried on 17 May 1601 &#145;in the chancel within the vault&#146; in St Olave's, on nearby Hart Street  (Bannerman, 132). On 23 June 1602 the administration of his estate was granted to Francis Bacon, but the newswriter John Chamberlain reported that he died &#145;so far in debt, that I think his brother is little the better by him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.123). To ease this, on 20 November Lady Bacon freely surrendered her life interest in her manors, which she had insistently denied to Anthony, in favour of Francis.<br>
<br>Bacon's life has usually been treated by historians as an adjunct to that of his more famous brother, not least because Francis Bacon presented it to posterity in that way. As his health deteriorated, making public office impossible, Francis capitalized on his brother's connections in ways that ultimately erased Anthony's contribution. Dedicating the first edition of his <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1597) to him, for example, Francis Bacon declared that &#145;I sometimes wish your infirmities translated upon myself, that her Majesty mought have the service of so active and able a mind, and I mought be with excuse confined to these contemplations and studies for which I am fittest&#146;  (sig. A4<i>r</i>). In turn (and probably at Francis's urging) Anthony wrote to Essex, sub-dedicating the volume to him, praying &#145;leave to transfer my interest unto your Lordship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. Spedding, 6.521&#150;2)&#151;a manoeuvre that effectively wrote himself out of a transaction between Francis Bacon and Essex. In 1600, in an attempt to rehabilitate Essex with the queen, Francis Bacon confected a set of two letters, one from his brother to Essex and the other replying: both epistles, however, also served his interest by testifying generously to his talents. Later, he claimed intimate knowledge of his brother's affairs to forge links with his Scottish intelligence contacts, now useful figures in the new Jacobean regime, including David Foulis, Edward Bruce, and Sir Thomas Chaloner, citing:<blockquote>the infinite devotion and incessant endeavours (beyond the strength of his body and nature of the times) which appeared in my good brother towards your majesty's service &hellip; all which endeavours and duties for the most part were common to myself with him, though by design (as between brethren) dissembled. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Spedding, 3.59)</blockquote>The ploy worked: when James I granted Francis Bacon the office of learned counsel, and a life pension of &pound;60 per annum in August 1604, the patent was awarded &#145;on account of the good, faithful and commendable service, until recently, of our beloved servant Anthony Bacon&#146;  (T. Rymer, ed., <span class="italic">Foedera, conventiones, literae</span>, 3rd edn, 1739&#150;45, 7/2.121).<br>
<br>Viewed without the benefit of his brother's self-serving hindsight, however, another Anthony Bacon emerges. Early political compositions attributed by editors to Francis Bacon were probably in effect collaborative efforts&#151;the latter writing up material provided by the former. Anthony Bacon was undeniably a highly capable intelligence gatherer, a literate, experienced, and informed man, with a formidable archive of useful secrets, whose talents&#151;although divorced from flamboyant court life&#151;were fully recognized by those players engaged in the complex negotiations of English and European politics during the last two decades of the sixteenth century, and whose meticulously kept correspondence provides an unparalleled insight into the period.<br>
