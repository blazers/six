<span class="headword">Cooper,  Myles</span>  (1736/7&#150;1785), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and American loyalist</span>, was born near Broughton in Furness, Lancashire, the son of William and Elizabeth Cooper, and was baptized probably on 19 February 1737 at Holy Trinity Church, Millom, Cumberland. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 27 February 1753, aged sixteen, and proceeded BA (1756) and MA (1760); in 1767 he was granted a DCL by diploma. During 1760&#150;61 he was a schoolteacher in Kent. Having returned to Queen's College as chaplain in 1761 he published, with collaborators, a volume of secular verse, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1761).<br>
<br>In 1762 the governors of King's College (subsequently Columbia University) in New York city, anticipating the retirement of the founder and first president of the institution, Samuel Johnson, and advancing the Anglicization of the college, asked Thomas Secker, archbishop of Canterbury, to recommend a clergyman as a successor. The request was sent to the Revd Edward Bentham, a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and later regius professor of divinity in the university, who selected Cooper. The 25-year-old joined a band of Queen's College graduates who had accepted clerical posts in America.<br>
<br>Having arrived in New York on 30 October 1762 Cooper was immediately appointed by the governors as an assistant to Johnson as well as professor of moral philosophy and fellow of the college. He immersed himself also in the affairs of the Anglican church in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut; he was elected president of the 1765 annual convention of the New York and New Jersey clergy. At the college he strengthened the library and provided intellectual leadership.<br>
<br>Under Cooper's aegis the curriculum, rules of conduct, and discipline of the college were revised, following the practices of Queen's College. The restructured procedures of the college imitated practices at Oxford University rather than those at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Whereas in the previous curriculum science and mathematics had been stressed, emphasis was now placed on Aristotelian principles of ethics, poetry, and politics and on Latin and Greek grammar and logic. Cooper's guidance inspired the governors to enhance the college in other ways; James Jay, brother of the revolutionary leader John Jay, sought financial support in England, while Cooper appointed new members of faculty and started a medical school. The college also received an endowment of land in Gloucester county (later part of Vermont). These measures may have contributed to the rise in the number of undergraduates entering King's College during this period. Cooper published in Latin his lectures on Aristotelian ethics, <span class="italic">Ethices compendium</span> (1774). In recognition of his services and leadership the governors of King's College granted him an LLD in 1768.<br>
<br>Probably half the college's students and alumni alive in 1776 were loyalists at the outbreak of the war of independence. Included in this assembly were Cooper, four of the five faculty members between 1770 and 1777, and more than two-thirds of the governors. On the eve of the war college authorities sought a &#145;Royal Charter for the College constituting it a University&#146;. The college would be an instrument for Anglicization, for &#145;cementing the Union between Great Britain and the Colonies&#146;, and for providing for the education of native colonists for the ministry. Cooper travelled to England in 1771, seeking the charter, grants of land, legal privileges comparable to those of Oxford and Cambridge, and royal funding for professorships. His efforts garnered more land grants, meagre funding for professors' salaries, and reduced quitrents on college lands. He pressed London authorities for the appointment of an American bishop, believing that a resident prelate would provide supervision over college affairs, subdue external critics, and superintend the provincial clergy. He returned to New York in 1772 without British officials having taken action on either a charter for the college or the appointment of a bishop. He brought with him, however, a valuable collection of books for the college library, donated by the Clarendon Press at Oxford University.<br>
<br>Cooper was the target of rising popular objections to English policies. As head of the college and as an Anglican clergyman he was a prominent symbol of imperial power and influence in the political turmoil of revolutionary New York. In April 1775 he was one of five New Yorkers to be warned in a public letter that &#145;Repeated insults and unparalleled oppressions have reduced the Americans to a state of desperation&#146;. Fearing for his life, Cooper fled for a few days to a British warship anchored in New York city harbour but soon returned to his duties. About midnight on 10 May 1775 a mob invaded the campus, and Cooper, aroused by a student, escaped half-dressed through a rear exit and sought safety in the home of a friend. The next day he boarded a British vessel; on 25 May 1775 he sailed for England.<br>
<br>A poem that appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for July 1776 recounted Cooper's New York experience; he provided his interpretation of the causes of the American War of Independence in a sermon preached at Oxford on 13 December 1776. As a loyalist he was granted a royal pension of &pound;200 per annum for life, later reduced by half. He resumed his fellowship at Queen's College, where he lived for several years. At the end of 1777 he was appointed senior minister of the episcopal chapel in Edinburgh. According to his will he also held two other benefices&#151;as rector of Cowley, in Gloucestershire, and vicar of Neen Savage, in Shropshire. A bachelor, late in life he supported several orphaned children in his family.<br>
<br>A large man of cultivated tastes, Cooper enjoyed good food and wine. He died among friends at a luncheon in Edinburgh on 20 May 1785. A man of his times, an active and persuasive leader of the state church in New York, Cooper unswervingly embraced his ordination oath of allegiance to the crown and parliament. His will, proved at London on 6 October 1785, bequeathed nearly all his estate, valued at more than &pound;2000, to his nephews and nieces, children of his brother Major John Cooper of the Cumberland militia and his sister, Esther Warrington of Carlisle.<br>
