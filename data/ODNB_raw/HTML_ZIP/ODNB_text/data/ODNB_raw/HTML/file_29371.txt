<span class="headword">Wightman,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580?, <em>d.</em> 1612), <span class="occ">alleged heretic</span>, may perhaps have been the child baptized on 14 July 1580 by his father John Wightman at Hinckley, Leicestershire; William Burton recorded in 1622 that he was from a family of the manor of Wykin in that parish. A report of his trial describes Wightman as a draper of the parish of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, and he was resident there in early 1609, attending the exercises led by the celebrated puritan minister Arthur Hildersam in the town. Here he voiced some very unorthodox views which Hildersam and his friends failed to shake. Wightman then set down his ideas in a manuscript, consisting of eighteen sheets, and delivered the work personally to James I, who was hunting at Royston, Cambridgeshire. The king's commission confirmed the existence of &#145;a book written and subscribed by him, and given to us&#146;, but this has not survived  (<span class="italic">A True Relation</span>, 9). This initiative brought him to the notice of the authorities. According to Samuel Clarke, &#145;the Bishop and his friends gave out, that Wightman learned his opinions &hellip; of the puritans, and of the foresaid exercises, and of Master Hildersham by name&#146;. But Wightman specifically denied this, recalling during his trial, at a public session on 26 November 1611 &#145;in the hearing of five hundred people&#146;, that Hildersam had sought to confute his views in private conference, arguing &#145;that his opinion of soul-sleeping was directly repugnant to the scriptures&#146;, and had publicly opposed him on 21 April 1609  (Clarke, 117). Nevertheless, in the following months the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Richard Neile, used Wightman's views as a means to denounce Hildersam before the king, in order to justify and authorize the suppression of the exercises with which he was associated, at both Burton and nearby Repton.<br>
<br>By the time of the start of his trial for heresy in November 1611, Wightman had been imprisoned for over six months, having been examined at least five times, on 18 April, 6 May, 9 September, and 8 and 29 October, by Bishop Neile and others including the young William Laud, then president of St John's College, Oxford. Laud also attended the trial, which opened in the consistory of Lichfield Cathedral on 19 November; subsequent sessions were held on 26 and 29 November and from 2 to 5 December. On 2 December, Wightman was said to have recalled that he had abandoned an orthodox Trinitarian position within the previous two years. It is clear from the report of his sentence that he had also adopted what later came to be known as &#145;seeker&#146; views, apparently identifying himself as one of the new apostles, or extraordinary men, who presaged the return of Christ. By now, he was found to hold &#145;That Jesus Christ is only man and a mere Creature and not both God and man in one person&#146;, but that &#145;Christ our saviour took not human flesh of the substance of the virgin Mary his mother&#146;. His belief in the sleep of the soul in death applied also to Jesus. Wightman is said to have referred to the Nicene and Athanasian creeds and the &#145;twelve articles of the belief&#146; as &#145;inventions of man&#146;  (Burrage, 2.218&#150;19).<br>
<br>On 3 December, Bishop Neile asked Wightman to confirm that the account of his views had been given &#145;freely of his own accord without distraction of mind&#146;, to which he replied in the affirmative  (Burrage, 2.219&#150;20). His conviction was &#145;as a heretic&#146; but the punishment was imposed by the civil power through a writ of 9 March issued under the great seal for his execution, and directed to the sheriff of Lichfield  (<span class="italic">A True Relation</span>, 9). Much later, on 9 August 1639, Neile himself recalled Wightman's first ordeal at the stake: &#145;the fire [having] scorched him a little, he cried out that he would recant. The people thereupon ran into the fire and suffered themselves to be scorched to save him&#146;; after reading a statement abjuring his views, Wightman was unchained and returned to prison. There, for two or three weeks, he considered his captors' demand for a formal written recantation. After refusing, he was brought once more to the consistory, where, reported Neile, he &#145;blasphemed more audaciously than before&#146;; Neile's further recollection that he had &#145;died blaspheming&#146; may therefore be taken to signify only that at his execution in April 1612 Wightman died reaffirming his earlier views  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 85).<br>
