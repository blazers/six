<span class="headword">Pigott, Sir  Gillery</span>  (1813&#150;1875), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Oxford, the fourth son of Paynton Pigott (1770&#150;1862) of Archer Lodge, Sherfield, Hampshire, and Banbury, Oxfordshire, who in 1836 assumed the additional names of Stainsby-Conant, and his wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1860), third daughter of Richard Drope Gough. Pigott was educated at the school of the Revd William Carmalt at Putney before entering the Middle Temple on 20 January 1836. A few months later he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1894), only child of Thomas Drake of Ashday Hall, near Halifax; they had two sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Pigott was called to the bar on 3 May 1839, and went on the Oxford circuit. With H. Rodwell he published a volume of reports of appeals from revising barristers (1844&#150;6). He was made counsel to the Inland Revenue in May 1854, and became a serjeant in February 1856, receiving a patent of precedence the following year. He was recorder of Hereford from December 1857 to December 1862. A Liberal in politics, he came forward for Banbury in 1859 but retired before nomination day. He became member of parliament for Reading in November 1860 and his most notable endeavour in that capacity was an unsuccessful bill to correct anomalies in the laws of Jersey.<br>
<br>On 3 October 1863 Pigott was made a baron of the court of exchequer, was knighted on 1 November, and thereby forfeited his parliamentary seat. According to an obituarist his appointment &#145;was received with some degree of disfavour by the Bar&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 April 1875). But he became well liked, being distinguished for his strict impartiality and conscientiousness rather than for any special abilities. Overshadowed by Pollock and Bramwell, he left little mark in the law reports. He died at his home, Sherfield Hill House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 27 April 1875 following a fall from his horse, though according to the doctor who attended him he suffered no internal injury and the cause of death was heart disease  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 May 1875). Late in life, Pigott had joined the Plymouth Brethren, having &#145;for a long while been a dissenter from the church of England liturgy&#146;  (Pigott, 3). He was buried at the parish church at Sherfield upon Lodden on 28 April 1875; with the concurrence of his widow, his eldest son, Arthur Gough Pigott (<i>b</i>. 1850), prevented the Anglican burial service from being read over the coffin, for which he was later fined &pound;1 with costs  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1875).<br>
