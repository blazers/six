<span class="headword">Morland, Sir  Thomas Lethbridge Napier</span>  (1865&#150;1925), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 9 August 1865 at Montreal, Canada, the eldest son of Thomas Morland, a manufacturing engineer, who, after emigrating to Canada as a young man, played an important part in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and his wife, Helen Elizabeth, daughter of General Henry Servante. On losing both his parents when still a child, Morland was brought to England to be educated, and sent to Charterhouse School (1878&#150;83) and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1883&#150;4). He was gazetted into the King's Royal Rifle Corps in August 1884. While still a subaltern he attended the Staff College, Camberley (1890&#150;92). On 18 February 1890 he married Mabel Elinor Rowena (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of Admiral Henry Craven St John; they had two daughters. After being promoted captain in April 1893 Morland was appointed aide-de-camp to General Sir A. J. Lyon Fremantle, commander-in-chief in Malta, in February 1895.<br>
<br>Being of an adventurous disposition, and a good horseman, Morland desired more active employment. This he found in Nigeria. In February 1898 he joined the West African Frontier Force in time to take part in the operations which were then in progress in the River Niger valley and hinterland. This was the first of six minor campaigns in those regions in which he participated with credit. Morland was rewarded with a brevet majority in July 1899 and given command of the 1st battalion, West African Frontier Force, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. Early in 1900 he commanded the little column engaged in the Kaduna expedition in Northern Nigeria; later in the same year he took part in the Asante operations, after which he obtained the brevet of lieutenant-colonel. In 1901 he conducted the operations against the emir of Yola, during which he was slightly wounded, and subsequently he received the DSO (1902). In the latter year he was given the command of the small Bornu expedition. Finally, in 1903, he was engaged in the campaign against the rulers of Kano and Sokoto. In the following March (1904) he was created CB. After a spell of leave Morland was promoted colonel in September 1905 and returned to Africa as inspector-general of the West African Frontier Force with the temporary rank of brigadier-general. He was engaged in no more fighting, and returned home in 1909.<br>
<br>Morland remained unemployed until June 1910 when he became general officer commanding (GOC), 2nd infantry brigade, at Aldershot. He held this command for three years, winning the good opinion of Sir Douglas Haig, who later described him as &#145;one of our best brigadiers&#146;  (Blake, 155). Morland spent the last year of peace on half pay owing to ill health, an occupational hazard of service in west Africa. Nevertheless after the outbreak of the First World War he was appointed (August 1914) to the command of the 47th (2nd London) division of the Territorial Force; soon afterwards he was transferred to the command of the newly created 14th division of the New Armies, and two months after that he was transferred to the vacant command of the 5th division. After arriving in Flanders on 18 October he led part of his new command at La Bass&eacute;e during the first battle of Ypres. In July 1915 he was promoted GOC, 10th corps, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-general, and was created KCB; 10th corps was then in process of formation, and so did not participate in any important engagement until it was allotted to the Fourth Army before the opening of the battle of the Somme (1 July 1916).<br>
<br>Morland's performance on the Somme won him some notoriety, especially during the first day when he insisted on positioning himself on an observation platform in a tree 2 miles from his headquarters. He saw nothing to cheer him from this vantage point; the 10th corps's attack against the Thiepval heights on 1 July was a complete failure and follow-up attacks were equally barren. General Sir Hubert Gough, then GOC, Reserve Army, expressed a lack of confidence in Morland to Haig on 23 July and at the end of the month the 10th corps was withdrawn to the Fourth Army reserve. On 17 August, however, Morland took over temporary command of the 14th corps. During his three-week stay the corps eventually managed to capture Guillemont and Ginchy after several reverses. Morland returned to the 10th corps on 10 September.<br>
<br>The 10th corps was transferred to the Second Army at Ypres in October 1916 and the following year participated in two of General Plumer's greatest successes. At Messines (7 June 1917) the corps captured Hill 60 and Mount Sorrel, weakening the German position east of Ypres. At the Menin Road ridge (20 September) it spearheaded the attack on the important tactical position of Gheluvelt, clearing the wooded area which had held up the British advance for two months. Later attacks across the Menin Road failed to repeat this success. Morland was knighted (KCMG) at the end of the year.<br>
<br>During the winter of 1917&#150;18 Morland and his staff were withdrawn into reserve, and 10th corps remained there throughout the German spring offensive (March&#150;April 1918). On 12 April Morland was transferred to the command of the 13th corps in the First Army reserve. He spent the summer cautiously advancing across the Lys plain. In September, 13th corps was transferred again, this time to the Fourth Army for the attack on the Hindenburg line; 13th corps' assault, on 5 October, was a great success, capturing a large section of the Hindenburg defences known as the Beaurevoir line. Morland pursued the retreating Germans, advancing 11 miles in four days. On 5 November 13th corps crossed the Sambre. In the last few days of the war it advanced 18 miles in six days, entering Belgium shortly before the armistice.<br>
<br>Morland was promoted substantive lieutenant-general in January 1919. But he was then struck down by the pandemic influenza and never really recovered good health. In March 1919 he returned to the command of his former troops, the reconstituted 10th corps, in the army of occupation at Cologne. A year later he succeeded Sir William Robertson as commander-in-chief of that army, and became temporary general. In March 1922 he returned home in order to assume the chief command at Aldershot in succession to Lord Cavan, and in November of that year he was promoted full general. Owing, however, to his impaired health he vacated his appointment at the end of February 1923. He never obtained further employment, and died rather suddenly at Villeneuve, Montreux, Switzerland, on 21 May 1925; he was buried in the English cemetery at Villeneuve. He had been appointed colonel of the Suffolk regiment in 1919, and an aide-de-camp general to George V in 1922.<br>
<br>Morland's record as a corps commander was patchy. In many ways it reflects that of the British expeditionary force as a whole. In 1916 he experienced more failures than successes, but in 1917, especially under Plumer, he performed well in limited set-piece operations. During the final advance, in the autumn of 1918, he also did well. He made no reputation as an innovative tactician and left little impression on the men he commanded. Morland was in appearance and manner an old-fashioned English officer and gentleman, calm, courteous, unselfish, and loyal. Towards the end of the war his health&#151;weakened by service in west Africa&#151;began to fail and he developed indolent habits which concerned his staff.<br>
