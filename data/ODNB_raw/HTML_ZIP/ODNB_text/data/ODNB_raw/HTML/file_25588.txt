<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson,  John Palgrave</span>  (1807&#150;1887), <span class="occ">playwright and novelist</span>, was born in Norwich on 13 June 1807, the second of the four sons of William Simpson, town clerk of the city of Norwich and treasurer of Norfolk, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of William Palgrave of Coltishall. Both parents descended from old families long resident in the county. His younger brother Palgrave (1815?&#150;1891), a mercantile lawyer of Liverpool, was also a skilled musician and author of <span class="italic">The Bandmaster's Guide</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise on Harmony</span>.<br>
<br>John Palgrave Simpson was educated first at home under private tutors, and afterwards at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 22 November 1824. He graduated BA in 1829 and five years later proceeded MA. On leaving the university he declined to take holy orders in the Church of England, despite his parents' wishes, but travelled at leisure about central Europe, residing principally, during the early part of his tour, in Germany. While at Munich, in 1842, Simpson became a Roman Catholic. Pope Gregory XVI, to mark his approval of the step, enrolled him as a knight of St Gregory. Two years later, while Simpson was still abroad, a bank failure involved his father, and he turned to literature for a livelihood. In 1846 he published a novel, <span class="italic">Second Love</span>, to which were added two minor tales, &#145;Pauvrette&#146; and &#145;The Maiden's Chamber&#146;. In 1847 he published <span class="italic">Gisella</span>, a romantic, melodramatic novel set in Hungary and dedicated to Hermine, Countess Rasoumoffsky, one of his friends. This was followed immediately by <span class="italic">Letters from the Danube</span>, a detailed and informative account of Hungarian life, based on his experiences in 1846, when he crossed Hungary &#145;from its western to its eastern boundaries&#146;  (vol. 1, p. 5).<br>
<br>In the 1840s Simpson was a contributor to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, and possibly to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. For the first three of these publications, he wrote, among other things, eye-witness accounts of the 1848 revolution in France, which were later collected in two volumes, <span class="italic">Pictures from Revolutionary Paris</span> (1849). In the same year he brought out his third novel, <span class="italic">The Lily of Paris, or, The King's Nurse</span>, a romance set in 1418, relating to Charles VI of France. In his &#145;presentation&#146; to Charles Langton Massingberd at the beginning of the book, he wrote that he had followed &#145;the picturesque and flowery paths of an historical tale&#146;  (vol. 1, p. v).<br>
<br>In 1850 Simpson settled permanently in London. He had already distinguished himself as an amateur actor, and had made himself familiar with English dramatic literature. While living in Europe, he had &#145;articled himself for a term as a pupil of Eug&egrave;ne Scribe, the popular French dramatist&#146;  (Coleman, <span class="italic">Players and Playwrights</span>, 2.167). He now devoted himself to writing plays, and supplied, within five years, four of the London theatres with eight one-act pieces, principally comediettas. He wrote, singly or in collaboration, some sixty plays between 1850 and 1885, including comedies, melodramas, farces, operettas, and extravaganzas. <span class="italic">A Scrap of Paper</span>, adapted from Victorien Sardou's <span class="italic">Pattes de mouche</span> (first produced at the St James' Theatre on 22 April 1861), and <span class="italic">Lady Dedlock's Secret</span>, adapted from Dickens's <span class="italic">Bleak House</span> (Her Majesty's Opera House, Aberdeen, 3 April 1874), both became stock theatrical pieces. Also held in high regard was <span class="italic">All for her</span>, written with Herman Merivale and loosely based on the plots of Dickens's <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> and Thackeray's <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span> (Mirror Theatre, Holborn, 18 October 1875). But at least one critic held that Simpson had &#145;a facile pen, more remarkable for neatness and elegance than strength&#146;  (Coleman, <span class="italic">Players and Playwrights</span>, 169). Charles Reade, however, declared that &#145;dear old Pal's lines are written in water, but his plots are engraved in steel&#146;  (Coleman, <span class="italic">Charles Reade</span>, 271). In 1865 Simpson produced a <span class="italic">Life of Weber</span>, an abbreviated translation of the German memoir written by the son of the composer. The <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> considered this version as &#145;in more respects than one an improvement of the original&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 421). The last book published by Simpson was his fourth novel, <span class="italic">For Ever and Never</span> (1884).<br>
<br>Simpson was a popular and striking figure in society. He was bearded and had a swarthy complexion, and habitually wore a cloak and felt hat. He was a long-standing member of the Garrick and Athenaeum clubs, an assiduous attender of first nights, and the secretary of the Dramatic Authors' Society from 1868 to 1887. He was unmarried, but proud of his adopted son, John Clayton, who held him in deep affection. Simpson died at the age of eighty, on 19 August 1887 at his London residence, 9 Alfred Place West, Thurloe Square, South Kensington, London, and was buried on 23 August in St Thomas's cemetery, Fulham.<br>
