<span class="headword">Rogers,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1646/7, <em>d.</em> in or before 1730), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born at Castle Hale, Painswick, Gloucestershire, the son of William Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1674), reeve of the manor. He came from an armigerous Dorset family associated with Castle Hale from the time of his grandfather. Educated at the College School, Gloucester, his first contact with Catholicism came when, as a young man, he met John Theyer of Cooper's Hill near Painswick, a convert with bibliographic interests and friend of Anthony Wood. In 1663, aged sixteen, Rogers matriculated from University College, Oxford, and later made a gift of books and manuscripts to the college, including the twelfth-century Durham version of Bede's life of Cuthbert, which had once belonged to Theyer.<br>
<br>In 1666 Rogers became a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in 1673. He became well known to the group of Catholic intellectuals gathered around the Franciscan Christopher Davenport, and joined them in the literary warfare then being fought over the claims of the Church of England to participation in the apostolic succession. He became a friend of Anthony Wood, for whom he unsuccessfully sought an office in the College of Arms, introduced Wood to Davonport, and in correspondence with Wood commented on many of the Catholic controversialists of the time. He disseminated an anonymous pamphlet exposing the activities of Hippolyt du Chastle de Luzancy, a French convert from Catholicism who became a member of Oxford University and an Anglican priest. In 1676 the privy council was informed that &#145;there are divers Popish and unlicensed books lodged in the chambers of William Rogers of Lincoln's Inn&#146; and ordered that his rooms should be searched. Described as &#145;a zealous proselyte for the Roman Catholic cause&#146; he was brought before the council &#145;from whom receiving several checks and threatenings he was at length released&#146;  (Fendley, 295, 289).<br>
<br>Rogers flourished under James II. University College was openly Catholic, with Obadiah Walker as master, and on the second anniversary of James's accession Rogers was able to demonstrate his loyalty by donating a statue of the king to the college. By now personally known to James he was among the royal retinue when the king visited Oxford and had the satisfaction of being present when James attended vespers at University College and received a loyal address. Royal favour extended to him in Gloucestershire where he was among the Catholics appointed to the commission of the peace in 1686&#150;7.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 Rogers fell from grace and retired to Painswick. Having seen Walker committed to the Tower he was understandably apprehensive; all his acquaintances &#145;were so scattered through the iniquity of the times&#146; and commerce with them would be difficult and dangerous  (Fendley, 292). Little is known of his domestic life: a daughter Susanna was baptized at Painswick in 1677, and his wife, Susanna, and infant son died in London in 1682. His epitaph for her in the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields was considered provocative and offended the churchwardens. He disposed of Castle Hale about 1701 and thereafter fades from view, apparently no longer a landowner. He was probably still alive in 1708 but by 1730 was referred to by Thomas Hearne as &#145;old Will. Rogers, now dead&#146;  (Fendley, 293).<br>
<br>Rogers was a man of wide acquaintance and friendship. A friend of Wood, he shared with John Aubrey an enthusiasm for inscriptions and epitaphs and was on familiar terms with the Catholic bibliophile Ralph Sheldon. He earned respect in Gloucestershire for his unswerving devotion to his faith and was seen as &#145;always constant and unalterable in the face of great changes in his fortunes&#146;  (Fendley, 293). His learning may not have been profound but his collection and preservation of books and manuscripts deserves to be remembered. The happy informality and erratic style of his correspondence reflects a headstrong nature that led him to push the relative tolerance of the times beyond its limits, and shows a lack of discretion in pursuing his own aims, reflected in Ralph Sheldon's comment that &#145;honest Will. Rogers&#146; was &#145;as hot in the head as ever&#146;  (Fendley, 294).<br>
