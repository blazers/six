<span class="headword">Wade,  George Edward</span>  (1853&#150;1933), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, the youngest of six sons of the Revd Nugent Wade, rector of St Anne's Church, Soho, London, and later canon of Bristol, and his wife, Louisa, was born on 2 March 1853 and baptized in St Anne's on 17 April. He was educated at Charterhouse School, Surrey (1863&#150;5), and later in Switzerland, becoming an intelligent scholar and good linguist with keen interests in cricket, fishing, and shooting. However, while reading for the bar, his health broke down and, following a period of recuperation in Italy and without formal art training, he took up painting, and an art patron, Sir Coutts Lindsay, provided him with a studio in London. Then in his mid-thirties and not entirely happy with his pictures, he turned to sculpture and was almost immediately successful with work in the round. His first exhibits at the Royal Academy were, in 1889, a bronze bust of Lieutenant-Colonel Myles Sandys MP; in 1890 a terracotta bust of his father; a terracotta statuette of a grenadier guard&#151;his most popular work&#151;of which a copy in bronze was purchased by Queen Victoria and one hundred others by the regiment; and a bronze statuette <span class="italic">Il Penseroso</span> (one of a pair) which was also sold in large numbers. In 1889 he married Isabella Mary Josephine (Ella), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General John Mackenzie Macintyre, Royal Artillery, of Fortrose, Ross-shire; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Wade then took over the studio of Sir J. Edgar Boehm and in 1891 his bust of the Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski was so appreciated that 500 reproductions of it were ordered for the American market alone. Throughout his career he continued with a series of busts of well-known personalities such as W. E. Gladstone, and General William Booth of the Salvation Army, and appealing statuettes such as <span class="italic">Aphrodite</span> (marble, exh. RA, 1891), <span class="italic">The Dancer</span>, and <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon</span> (bronze, exh. RA, 1892). However, more of his time was taken up with monumental sculpture, such as the colossal bronze statue of the duke of Connaught for Hong Kong (exh. RA, 1892); those of Queen Victoria for Allahabad, India, and Colombo, Ceylon; William Rose Mansfield, first Baron Sandhurst, for Bombay; a Cameron highlander for Inverness; and Sir John A. MacDonald for the Canadian cities of Montreal, Quebec, and Hamilton and Kingston, Ontario. One of his largest commissions was the South African War memorial in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, a composition in marble and bronze surmounted by a winged figure; and he produced, among others, statues of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, the equestrian statues of the maharaja Sir Chandra Shamshere Yung for Nepal and the first Earl Haig for the esplanade outside Edinburgh Castle, and a children's fountain for the Women's World Temperance Association, a replica of which was placed in Temple Gardens, London.<br>
<br>With so many commitments it is understandable that Wade ceased rather early in his career to show his work in public exhibitions, but he still found time to pursue other interests. In the early days of aviation he made designs for aeroplanes and, later in life, took up golf and planned houses for himself and his friends in Berkshire. The popularity of his sculpture was probably due not only to the fact that it was always comprehensible but that it was both ennobling and restrained in equal measure. In portraiture he obtained at the same time a good likeness, much appreciated by the sitters and their families, and, in these works and in his more fanciful subjects, he engendered feelings of respect and admiration. It might be argued by some that his approach was too prosaic, but it would perhaps be more true to say that he cloaked classical ideals in the trappings of his own environment. His last major work was a war memorial in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, unveiled in 1931. He died at his home, 30 Hyde Park Street, London, on 5 February 1933.<br>
