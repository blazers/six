<span class="headword">Emberton,  Joseph</span>  (1889&#150;1956), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 23 December 1889 at Shraley House, Audley, Staffordshire, the eldest of the three sons and four children of Samuel Emberton, draper, and his wife, Annie Amelia, daughter of John Hodgkins, farmer and miller. He was educated at the Orme Boys' School, Newcastle under Lyme, then articled to the local architects Chapman and Snape. By studying in the evenings at Burslem Art School, Emberton won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in 1911; he worked for the London architects Trehearne and Norman from 1913 to 1914. He served during the First World War in the Honourable Artillery Company, first as a gunner in Egypt and later as a trajectory officer in France, and was badly wounded in October 1918.<br>
<br>On recovery, in 1918 Emberton joined Sir John Burnet and T. S. Tait, until he established a practice with P. J. Westwood, from 1922 to 1926. They designed kiosks for the British Empire Exhibition, Wembley (1924), using simple shapes with colourful decoration. Summit House, Holborn (1925), for Austin Reed Ltd, whose Regent Street shop interiors Westwood and Emberton designed in 1926, shows Burnet and Tait's influence. Emberton continued to design shops in the fashionable art deco style, for Lotus and Delta shoes and others. He was selected by Sir Lawrence Weaver to design the advertising exhibition, Olympia, West Kensington (1927), the first such exhibition with a unified style.<br>
<br>Emberton showed the influence of Dutch modern architecture in the fa&ccedil;ade added to New Empire Hall, Olympia (1930). The Royal Corinthian yacht club, Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex (1931), established his modernist reputation, and was the only British building included in the exhibition &#145;The international style&#146; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1932. The functionalist design owed much to Emberton's assistant George Fairweather (1906&#150;1986). With Universal House, London (1933; dem.), Emberton enveloped a framed structure in glass curtain-walling, intended to rise higher than the original three storeys. Simpson's shop in Piccadilly, London (1936), was structurally innovative, although the welded plate girders designed by the consulting engineer, Felix Samuely, had to be modified to meet London county council regulations. The simple fa&ccedil;ade was enlivened at night by thin coloured neon lights and the interior had elegant shopfittings and modern furnishings. It demonstrated the maturity of English modernism and its commercial advantages.<br>
<br>Apart from the HMV shop in Oxford Street, London (1939), and the temporary Soleil pavilion at the Paris 1937 exhibition, Emberton's other main work is the circular casino at the Blackpool pleasure beach, Lancashire (1939), where he had already designed the fun house and grand national (1935), showing the adaptability of modernism to popular entertainment. The casino, containing restaurants and a flat for the owners, was given holiday spirit with a viewing platform reached by a spiral stair adjoining the entrance.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Emberton was housing officer to the Ministry of Aircraft Production, architectural adviser on hostels to the Ministry of Works, and consultant to the Ministry of Supply on the design of steel houses. After 1945 he designed mostly flats in London and developed planning ideas influenced by Le Corbusier.<br>
<br>Emberton's approach was practical rather than theoretical, and enabled him to make elegant and workable buildings for commercial clients. He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, with great charm of manner. He loved horses, the birds in his outdoor aviary, and his 1934 Bentley. On 23 June 1926 he married Kathleen Marie (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), daughter of William Herbert Chantrey, a chartered accountant; they had two daughters. Emberton died at Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 20 November 1956. His wife survived him.<br>
