<span class="headword">Peirce <span class="st"> [Pierce]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the only son of the Revd Robert Pierce (1592&#150;1641), rector of Combe Hay, Somerset, and his wife, Elizabeth (1597&#150;1657), daughter of Chiddiock Tutt of Salisbury, was born at Combe Hay and baptized there on 6 March 1622. After attending King Edward's School, Bath, he was sent to Winchester College, and from there to Lincoln College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 26 October 1638. He graduated BA on 15 June 1642, MA and MB on 21 October 1650, and MD on 12 September 1661. His boyhood and youth were sickly: at ten he had general dropsy, at twelve smallpox, at fourteen tertian ague, and at twenty-one measles with profuse bleeding from the nose. In 1651 Peirce married Anna (1621&#150;1688), daughter of David Trym (or Tryme) of Wookey, Somerset. They had two sons and two daughters. The first child, Elizabeth, died aged nineteen years. The second, Robert, died aged one year. The third, Mary, survived twenty-three years and produced for her parents a grandson, Pierce A'Court. Their fourth child, Charles, died aged four years.<br>
<br>After a short residence in Bristol Peirce settled in practice near the Somerset levels, where in 1652 he became ill again, this time with a &#145;quartan ague&#146; (probably malaria, which was endemic in this area at that time). This weakened him so much that he decided to leave the district. His fellow collegian, Christopher Bennet, advised him to try London; but, though there were then three physicians in full practice at Bath, Peirce decided to settle there in 1653, and built up a &#145;riding practice&#146;, making visits to patients living between 10 and 30 miles from the city. On 15 April 1660 he was elected to the office of physician to poor strangers. As the older physicians died, Peirce established himself as a specialist in Bath mineral water treatment, taking patients of distinction to reside with him in the Abbey House, which he rented as a private lodging. Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnell, stayed with him for five weeks from April 1686, and was given Quercetanus's tartar pills for several nights, followed by two quarts of the King's Bath Water in the morning for several days, as severe measures were needed to get him fit within two or three months, so that he could take up his post in Ireland. The duke of Hamilton, the duchess of Ormond, the marchioness of Antrim, Lord Stafford, and General Talmash or Tollemache, were among Peirce's patients. He also cured Captain Harrison, son-in-law of Bishop Jeremy Taylor, of lead palsy. Sir Charles Scarborough, Sir William Wetherby, Sir John Micklethwaite, Phineas Fowke, Gideon Harvey, Richard Lower, Thomas Short, and many other famous physicians sent patients to him.<br>
<br>In 1689 Peirce visited London, and, having been nominated in James II's new charter to the Royal College of Physicians, was admitted a fellow on 19 March 1689. He had earned this honour by many original observations, which he eventually published in 1697 in his <span class="italic">Bath Memoirs</span>. He is probably the first English writer to note the now well-known occurrence of acute rheumatism as a sequel to scarlet fever; and his account of Major Arnot's case, in which muscular feebleness of the arm followed the constant carrying of a heavy falcon on one fist, is the first suggestion of the condition later described as &#145;repetitive strain syndrome&#146;. He carried out post-mortem examinations on some patients, one of which was on the body of Sir Robert Craven, who had a mediastinal tumour; and another on a man with osteomyelitis of the hip. These original observations entitle him to a high place among English physicians. Peirce died in Bath in June 1710 and was buried in Bath Abbey.<br>
