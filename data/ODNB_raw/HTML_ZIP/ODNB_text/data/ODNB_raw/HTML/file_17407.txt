<span class="headword">McCrie,  Thomas</span>  (1797&#150;1875), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian and Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 7 November 1797, the eldest in a family of four sons and a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17406/', "Thomas McCrie (1772&#150;1835)")</script>, Secession church minister, and his wife, Janet Dickson (<i>d</i>. 1821). He was educated at the high school and university in Edinburgh before entering the theological hall of the Original Secession church. Licensed on 15 August 1820, McCrie was ordained minister of a congregation at Crieff, Perthshire, in 1821, but it was so poorly supported that he demitted the charge in July 1826. He was inducted to a church at Clola, Aberdeenshire, on 16 April 1829. On 28 December 1830 he married Walteria Chalmers (<i>d</i>. 1875), the daughter of a Secession minister and sister of his father's second wife. There were no children. McCrie succeeded his father in Davie Street Church, Edinburgh, on 9 June 1836 and in the same year succeeded Dr George Paxton as the theological professor of the Original Secession church. McCrie received the degrees of DD from Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1848 and LLD from Glasgow University in 1850.<br>
<br>McCrie was moderator of his church's synod when it united with the Free Church of Scotland in 1852 and moderator of the Free Church general assembly in 1856. In October of that year he demitted his charge in order to serve as professor of church history and exegesis to the English Presbyterian synod. He remained in London until, his sight affected by cataract, he retired to Gullane, East Lothian, in 1866.<br>
<br>A good preacher, McCrie is chiefly remembered for his publications, which included his father's collected works in four volumes, a biography of his father, several titles for the Wodrow Society, and <span class="italic">Sketches of Scottish Church History</span>, which passed through several editions. For several years McCrie was editor of the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Evangelical Review</span> and he was also a contributor to <span class="italic">The Witness</span> under Hugh Miller. He enjoyed a close friendship with James Aitken Wylie (1808&#150;1890), whose background, interests, and conservative outlook were similar to his own.<br>
<br>He died on 9 May 1875 at his home, 39 Minto Street, Edinburgh, and was buried beside his father in Greyfriars churchyard on 14 May. His wife predeceased him by a matter of weeks.<br>
