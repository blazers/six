<span class="headword">Blair,  Hugh</span>  (1718&#150;1800), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and literary critic</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 7 April 1718, the only child of John Blair, a clerk in the Excise Office, and Martha, daughter of Alexander Ogston, an Edinburgh bookseller, and his wife, Martha, who operated her late husband's bookshop in Parliament Square until 1738. Although his father never attained prominence after losing his inheritance in the unsuccessful Darien scheme, Blair was descended from a prominent Scottish family that included his great-grandfather Robert Blair (1593&#150;1666), a professor at the University of Glasgow and a leading Presbyterian reformer. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and the University of Edinburgh, which he entered in the autumn of 1731 at thirteen. At the university he came under the influence of the professor of logic, John Stevenson, who incorporated the study of English rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i> into his classes. As he passed through the arts and divinity courses, Blair began to associate with a group of students, mostly a few years younger than himself, who remained his close friends and academic and ecclesiastical colleagues in the moderate party of the Church of Scotland. The roots of Blair's career as an author can be traced to his student days in Edinburgh, when he is supposed to have published <span class="italic">A Poem Sacred to the Memory of the Reverend Mr. James Smith</span> (1736), no copies of which have survived, and to have co-authored, with his cousin George Bannatine, a poem entitled &#145;The Resurrection&#146;, which circulated in manuscript. In addition his student notes on chronology are believed to have formed the foundation of a volume of <span class="italic">Chronology and History of the World</span> that first appeared in 1754, under the name of his distant relation in the Church of England, John Blair. In February 1739 Hugh successfully defended his MA thesis, &#145;De fundamentis et obligatione legis naturae&#146;, which argued that benevolence is rooted in natural law. While completing his divinity studies he worked as a tutor, including a stint in the highlands in 1740 as tutor to Simon Fraser, eldest son of Lord Lovat.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerinthechurch"></a>Early career in the church</h2>On 21 October 1741 Blair was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Edinburgh, and on 23 September 1742 he was ordained as the minister of the little parish of Collessie in Fife, thanks to the patronage of Lord and Lady Leven. Within a few months he was a candidate for the second charge in the Canongate church, then an independent parish, though situated near the heart of Edinburgh. He secured the call to the Canongate after besting a rival, Robert Walker, by a margin of 136 to 82 in a vote among the eligible parishioners, and was translated on 14 July 1743. During his eleven years in the Canongate, Blair steadily developed his reputation as an up-and-coming preacher in the kirk. At the unusually young age of twenty-eight he was elected moderator of the presbytery of Edinburgh, and in that capacity preached a sermon, &#145;The wrath of man praising God&#146;, to open the proceedings on 18 May 1746, one month after the battle of Culloden ended the Jacobite rising led by Charles Edward Stuart. Published in the same year, the sermon was a jeremiad on the 'Forty-Five, interpreted in the style of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, as a providential chastising of the British people for their sinful ways&#151;a traditional rhetorical device to which Blair would return in later years. On 1 January 1750 Blair was invited to preach on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, and that sermon, &#145;The importance of religious knowledge to the happiness of mankind&#146;, was also published separately. Three years later he edited for the press Frederick Carmichael's posthumous <span class="italic">Sermons on Several Important Subjects</span>, to which he contributed the preface. Blair has usually been credited with editing another publication of 1753, the Edinburgh edition of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Works</span>, but the editor was actually John Reid, the press corrector for the printers, Murray and Cochran.<br>
<br>It was during his Canongate period, on 19 April 1748, that Blair married his first cousin Katherine Bannatine (<i>d</i>. 1795), daughter of his uncle James Bannatine, an Edinburgh minister. She was said to be a woman &#145;of a Masculine Understanding, of a Cheerfull Temper and Amiable Manners&#146;, ideally suited for Blair who, &#145;Being of an Infantine Disposition, needed a Mate of a Superior and Decisive Mind, on which he could Rely for advice, in all his Doubts and Perplexities, which Occurd almost every Hour&#146;  (Carlyle, &#145;Comparison&#146;, 278). In January 1749 the Blairs had a daughter, Katherine, who grew up as an only child after their second child, a son, died in infancy.<br>
<br>On 8 March 1754 Blair was called to Edinburgh proper as the minister of Lady Yester's Church, where he was settled on 11 October. The mid-1750s was a time of intense conflict over the relationship between culture and piety in the Church of Scotland, and Blair was at the centre of the struggle. In 1755&#150;6 he participated in the original <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, a short-lived periodical produced by his circle of friends for the purpose of showing off and encouraging Scottish polite learning, in opposition to the straight and narrow Calvinism of the moderates' opponents. Blair is thought to have contributed to the first number the reviews of Francis Hutcheson's <span class="italic">System of Moral Philosophy</span> and the first two volumes of Bishop Sherlock's <span class="italic">Discourses</span> (and possibly also Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span>), and to the second and last number the reviews of the third volume of Sherlock's <span class="italic">Discourses</span> and John Jortin's <span class="italic">Six Dissertations upon Different Subjects</span>. He is also believed to have written about this time two anonymous pamphlets defending his friends David Hume and Henry Home, Lord Kames, against charges of infidelity in the Scottish church courts: <span class="italic">Observations on a pamphlet, entitled an analysis of the moral and religious sentiments contained in the writings of Sopho [Kames], and David Hume, esq.</span> (1755) and (with three other Edinburgh ministers) <span class="italic">Objections Against the Essays on Morality and Natural Religion Examined</span> (1756). In December 1756 he took part in a rehearsal of the tragedy <span class="italic">Douglas</span> by his friend John Home, playing the small part of the maid Anna, but he did not risk the wrath of his fellow churchmen by attending the professional performances of the play that followed.<br>
<br>Blair received an honorary DD degree from the University of St Andrews on 13 June 1757. On 15 June 1758 he took his place as one of the ministers of the High or New Kirk in St Giles's Church, Edinburgh, after a bitter dispute in which the moderates and their political allies in the general assembly managed, by a vote of sixty-four to fifty-four, to overturn a decision by the synod that would have deprived Blair of that prestigious charge. Once settled at St Giles's, Blair cultivated his reputation as a leading figure in the church. He was a member of the church committee that produced a new version of biblical translations and paraphrases (1781) used in worship, and is supposed to have been personally responsible for revising numbers 4, 33, 34, 44, and 45. He was a delegate to the annual general assembly on a number of occasions, but he never participated in its debates and rarely played a leading role in the management of ecclesiastical affairs, at least until after 1780, when the retirement of the moderate leader&#151;his lifelong friend the historian William Robertson&#151;led to Blair's being consulted more often for advice on ecclesiastical matters. He had no enemies in the church and was on excellent terms with Robert Walker, his colleague at St Giles's, a leader of the rival popular party and his former opponent in the election for the Canongate charge, whose life Blair commemorated in a portion of a funeral sermon that was preached on 13 April 1783 and was prefixed to the third volume of Walker's <span class="italic">Sermons on Practical Subjects</span> in 1784.<h2>
<a name="Manofletters"></a>Man of letters</h2>Meanwhile, Blair was pursuing a second career, as a man of letters and an academic. He was an active participant in the convivial and intellectual club-life that characterized the culture of the Scottish Enlightenment. He was an early member of the Select Society (1754&#150;64) and in 1761 was one of the directors of its offshoot, the Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language. He was a member of the whiggish Revolution Club at Edinburgh, an honorary member of the Belles Lettres Society (elected 8 May 1760), a member of the convivial Oyster Club, and from the early 1760s until the mid-1780s a moderately active member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73613/', "Poker Club")</script>, established by his circle of friends to promote the establishment of a Scots militia. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 17 November 1783, and became one of the four founding presidents of its literary class at their first meeting on the same day.<br>
<br>On 11 December 1759 Blair began delivering public lectures on English language and literature, following the tradition of Adam Smith and Robert Watson, the future historian, who was his relation by marriage. Six months later, on 27 June 1760, the town council of Edinburgh appointed him professor of rhetoric at the University of Edinburgh, with no salary but the right to collect class fees from his students, and on 3 September he was admitted to the university by the senatus academicus. This was the first dedicated chair of English in any university. On 27 April 1762 it was further enhanced by the creation for Blair of the regius chair of rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i>, with an annual salary of &pound;70 and the continued right to collect class fees. Earlier in 1762 Blair had half-heartedly put himself forward for the vacant principalship of the university, which was given to his friend Robertson, but he seems to have done so merely in order to strengthen his claim for the regius chair, to which he was formally admitted by the senatus academicus on 21 July.<br>
<br>Blair's rise to prominence in the field of rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i> was closely connected with his leading role in the emergence of the supposedly ancient Celtic bard Ossian during the early 1760s. Learning from friends that a young highlander by the name of James Macpherson possessed samples of ancient Gaelic poetry, Blair arranged for Macpherson's purported translations to appear in a small volume entitled <span class="italic">Fragments of Ancient Poetry, Collected in the Highlands of Scotland</span>, published in Edinburgh on 14 June 1760, and almost immediately reissued in a second edition which added an additional poem. Blair also wrote the preface to the <span class="italic">Fragments</span>, which mentioned an &#145;Epic poem&#146; that might, if recovered, &#145;serve to throw considerable light upon the Scottish and Irish antiquities&#146;  (p. viii). After Macpherson visited the highlands and published in late 1761 the epic poem in question, <span class="italic">Fingal</span> (1762), Blair expanded a classroom lecture on Ossian into his first major work, <span class="italic">A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian, the Son of Fingal</span>. It was published in London in January 1763 in a quarto format, and immediately made his international reputation as a literary critic. That spring Blair visited London, where young James Boswell served as his guide and Samuel Johnson insulted him by doubting in his presence the authenticity of Macpherson's work. Pressed by the growing doubts of Englishmen such as Johnson, along with a few sceptical Scottish friends such as David Hume, Blair produced a second, octavo edition of his <span class="italic">Critical Dissertation</span> in 1765, which added commentary on Macpherson's second Ossianic epic, <span class="italic">Temora</span> (1763). It also had an appendix containing testimonial evidence regarding the authenticity of Macpherson's Ossianic poetry, which he hoped would convince even &#145;that Barbarian Samuel Johnson&#146;  (Blair to Hume, 1 July 1765, NL Scot., MS 23153, no. 53). The <span class="italic">Critical Dissertation</span> (without the appendix) was reissued with very minor changes in 1772, 1784&#150;5, 1790, and 1796, was included in most editions of the poems of Ossian, and was translated into several European languages. But it could not quell the controversy over the extent of Ossian's authenticity, which is still being disputed more than two hundred years later. In the early 1780s Blair was reluctantly drawn into a particularly acrimonious controversy concerning Ossian, generated by charges that in 1765 Thomas Percy had been subjected to a bogus recitation of Ossianic poetry at Blair's Edinburgh house in James's Court.<br>
<br>The house in question was owned by David Hume, who rented it to Blair while the owner was abroad. During the first half of 1769 Blair's little family moved to a &#145;neat &amp; commodious&#146; house in Argyle Square  (James Shaw, &#145;Nine Months in Scotland, 1795&#150;96&#146;, NL Scot., Adv. MS 16.2.15, fol. 53), where Blair was to remain for the rest of his life. On 23 August 1769 the Blairs suffered a severe blow when their beloved daughter Katherine died at the age of twenty. In his grief Blair retired &#145;for some time from social intercourse and professional labour&#146;  (Somerville, 167), and undertook an excursion to the north of England with two clergymen not much older than his daughter, Thomas Somerville and Samuel Charters. Somerville later recollected that Blair remained a good friend for life, and many others found him so as well. He took a particular interest in patronizing younger ministers and writers, such as the African traveller James Bruce, the historian Robert Watson, the miscellaneous writer and clergyman John Logan, and the Scots poet Robert Burns, who called him &#145;a worthy and most respectable character&#146; in his second commonplace book. But Burns was also aware of Blair's faults as a critic and a man. He spoke with what Burns considered an unpleasant burr, could be vain and prudish, sometimes caring more about propriety than creativity, and all in all seemed to the Ayrshire poet to be &#145;merely an astonishing proof of what industry and application can do&#146;  (Lindsay, 32). However, according to Blair's nephew, James Shaw, &#145;his vanity &hellip; was mixed with so much good nature that it gave offence to no one&#146;  (Shaw, &#145;Nine Months&#146;, fol. 13). Blair's contemporary biographer, John Hill, expressed a similar view, and so did his friend Alexander Carlyle, who observed that though &#145;a vain man&#146; Blair had remarkably little envy or &#145;malignity&#146;, and possessed &#145;truly a pure mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 307). In this he was much like his good friend David Hume, with whom he lived in great intimacy, in spite of their differences concerning religion and other matters.<br>
<br>Like most other clergymen affiliated with the moderate party, Blair was staunchly conservative in his political views. Early in the American War of Independence he preached a fast-day sermon against the Americans on 12 December 1776, which so offended James Boswell that it caused him to stop attending Blair's church for a period of time. In opposition to Boswell's claim that in this case &#145;Resistance is not Rebellion&#146;  (Boswell to Blair, 24 Feb 1777, Yale University Library, L59), Blair argued that the Americans were reacting against the fear of oppression rather than against actual oppression, and that therefore &#145;their resistance is in my view rebellion in its most criminal extent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell in Extremes</span>, 359&#150;60).<h2>
<a name="BlairsSermons"></a>Blair's Sermons</h2>Blair's exchange with Boswell on the American war coincided with his publishing an octavo volume of <span class="italic">Sermons</span> that evolved into an extraordinarily popular five-volume work. He initially received &pound;100 for the copyright from his friend Alexander Kincaid, bookseller and lord provost of Edinburgh, who was planning to print a small first edition of the work as a favour to the author but died before its appearance. Toward the end of 1776 the London publishers William Strahan and Thomas Cadell purchased shares of the copyright, on the strength of the reputation of the author and a strong recommendation from William Robertson. The book was printed in Edinburgh under the supervision of Kincaid's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and successor, William Creech, who sent half a printed sheet containing the book's first sermon to London for Strahan's inspection. Strahan thought little of what he read and on 6 December 1776 sent off an angry letter to Robertson, accusing him of prejudice for having recommended the volume &#145;so warmly&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 3942, fols. 299&#150;300). Samuel Johnson reassured Strahan after reading the first sermon, though Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> errs in claiming that Johnson's favourable judgement was instrumental in bringing about the book's publication, which was already assured. The volume was published in Edinburgh on 8 February 1777 and in London on 15 April, and was immediately successful.<br>
<br>Blair produced a second volume in 1780, a third in 1790, and a fourth in 1794, and at the time of his death he was preparing for the press a fifth volume, which appeared posthumously in 1801. In light of the initial response by Strahan, there is considerable irony in the fact that, by the time of his death in 1785, he had printed 33,500 copies of the first two volumes of Blair's <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, more copies than he printed of any other book. Sales were so strong that the value of the copyright rose to &pound;500 for the second volume and &pound;600 for each of the subsequent volumes, and the publishers periodically gave Blair additional cash gifts that were the functional equivalent of royalties. Thus Blair earned well over &pound;2000 for the four volumes published in his lifetime&#151;a vast sum for any eighteenth-century author, but unheard of for an author of sermons. The royal family was particularly fond of the work, making it easier for Blair's former student Henry Dundas, the lord advocate of Scotland, to secure for him a pension of &pound;200 per annum, on 25 July 1780. The first volume of the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> reached a twenty-second edition during Blair's lifetime, and in 1807 the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> proclaimed the five-volume collection &#145;the most popular work in the English language&#146;  (vol. 11, 170), excepting <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. That popularity seems to have derived from the combination of an elegant prose style, a reassuring philosophy of moral comfort grounded in Christian stoicism, and perceptive psychological insights into human nature.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>In 1767 Blair published <span class="italic">Heads of the Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, in the University of Edinburgh</span>, which was reissued in 1771 and 1777. By the early 1780s he was considering publishing the lectures themselves, allegedly because he was worried about the wide circulation of corrupt manuscript copies, but perhaps also because he was then contemplating his retirement from the classroom. <span class="italic">Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</span> appeared in two quarto volumes on 7 June 1783 in London, and on 5 July in Edinburgh. The publishers were once again Strahan, Cadell, and Creech, who paid Blair a handsome fee of &pound;1500. As the author explained to his publishers on 21 June 1783, the work was based &#145;on plain common sense, so as to be intelligible to all, without any abstruse metaphysics&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 3813, fols. 17&#150;18). It also benefited from Blair's comprehensive approach to his subject, which included discussions of the principles of taste and criticism, the rise and development of language, style, and various types of eloquence, both written and oral. Blair's book immediately became the new standard for the study of rhetoric and literary criticism, and was particularly popular and influential in the United States, where the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> also enjoyed great fame during the first half of the nineteenth century. In July 1784 Blair officially became joint holder of the rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i> chair with his disciple William Greenfield, who had already begun lecturing and collecting the class fees, while Blair continued to receive the &pound;70 annual salary for life. According to a biographical sketch written just before his death, Blair's pension was raised from &pound;200 to &pound;300 per annum on the occasion of his academic retirement.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1793 Blair preached a patriotic fast-day sermon against the French Revolution and its influence, &#145;On the love of our country&#146;; it would eventually find its way into the fifth volume of his <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, consisting mainly of older sermons which he continued to revise for the press throughout the 1790s. He suffered a blow upon the death of his old friend William Robertson in June 1793, another when Robertson's office as principal of the university was not offered to him as an expected courtesy, and still another, far more devastating, when his wife, Katherine, died on 9 February 1795. He lived his last years with his niece and adopted daughter, Elizabeth Hunter, an orphan whom the Blairs had brought into their home shortly after their daughter's death; they passed winters in Argyle Square and summers at a country house called Summerfield, at the seaside in nearby Leith. On 20 May 1796 Blair preached a sermon that was published for the benefit of the Sons of the Clergy under the title <span class="italic">The Compassion and Beneficence of the Deity</span>. Although pained by gout, he nevertheless remained mentally sharp and active until just before his death, at the age of eighty-two, on 27 December 1800. He was buried in Greyfriars churchyard and left behind a substantial estate, including bonds worth approximately &pound;4000, the Argyle Square house and its furnishings, and a fine library of some 2400 volumes, which were sold at auction in two parts, in April 1801 and April 1816. His personal papers and manuscripts were burned, in accordance with a directive in his will.<br>
