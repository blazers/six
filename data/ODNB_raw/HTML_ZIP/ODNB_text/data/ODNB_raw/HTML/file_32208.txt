<span class="headword">Butler,  Edward Joseph Aloysius</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Cuthbert]</span>  (1858&#150;1934), <span class="occ">abbot of Downside and scholar</span>, was born in Dublin on 6 May 1858, the only child of Edward Butler (<i>d</i>. 1902), barrister, and his wife, Mary Cruise (<i>d</i>. 1897). His father had been professor of mathematics in Newman's recently established Catholic University in Dublin. Educated at Downside near Bath in Somerset from 1869 to 1875, Butler entered the Benedictine noviciate at Belmont Priory, Hereford, in 1876, taking in religion the name of Cuthbert. There he acquired his lifelong attachment to the spiritual teaching of Augustine Baker and the ascetical practice of manual labour.<br>
<br>In 1880 Butler returned to Downside, where the young Aidan Gasquet was prior, and the liturgical scholar Edmund Bishop&#151;like Butler himself, a virtual autodidact&#151;was a frequent visitor. Butler was ordained priest in 1884 and taught in the school, but his principal interest was the contemporary movement to win traditional monastic autonomy for Downside and the other houses of the English Benedictine congregation. The congregation was at that time a highly centralized body, and the monasteries were viewed principally as &#145;feeders&#146;, providing priests for the numerous Benedictine parishes. The movement's objective was in large part achieved in 1900, when the monasteries became abbeys, and their independent liturgical and intellectual life began to flower.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1896, Butler was sent to Cambridge as the first superior of Benet House, where Downside monks could study at the university, under the auspices of Christ's College. There he edited the <span class="italic">Lausiac History of Palladius</span> (1898, 1904). After returning to Downside as sub-prior in 1904, he was elected abbot in 1906. Re-elected in 1914 he was also abbot president of the congregation from 1914 to 1921. He published a critical edition of the rule of St Benedict in 1912 and in 1919 published his most respected work, <span class="italic">Benedictine Monachism</span>, which combines judicious scholarship with many reflections on his own experience. He also published the more controverted <span class="italic">Western Mysticism</span> (1922).<br>
<br>In the same year Butler resigned the abbacy on a matter of monastic principle: it seems that he failed to win the community's support for his proposal that no monk should be liable under obedience to serve in the outlying Benedictine parishes. Thereafter he lived at Ealing Priory, writing <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Bishop Ullathorne</span> (2 vols., 1926) and <span class="italic">The Vatican Council</span> (2 vols., 1930), which is drawn almost entirely from Ullathorne's letters, a narrative that is detailed, fair-minded, and free of all party spirit. He died suddenly of heart failure at Clapham on Easter day, 1 April 1934, and was buried at Downside.<br>
<br>By temperament Butler was a scholar rather than an administrator, and impressed everyone he encountered with his intellectual honesty and sincere piety. As abbot, though he held strongly that a monastery should be a family, he was not himself gifted with the necessary fatherly qualities. Some have also criticized him for allowing the development of Downside School to endanger the monastic observance he restored. But as a teacher and practitioner of a sane and balanced monasticism, it would be hard to find his equal, and his written works on this subject have not dated. Butler received the honorary degree of doctor of letters from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1908.<br>
