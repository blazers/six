<span class="headword">Anstie,  John</span>  (1743&#150;1830), <span class="occ">clothier</span>, was born on 7 September 1743 in Devizes, the eldest son of John Anstie (1698&#150;1779), grocer and snuff maker, and his third wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharpe). He was baptized at Devizes Baptist Church, and later became a prominent member of the congregation. On 4 April 1780 he married Mary Vesey (<i>b</i>. 1746) of Wotton under Edge; they had one daughter, Mary Ann, born in 1781.<br>
<br>After being in partnership with his father, Anstie decided in 1784 to specialize in the clothing trade, manufacturing &#145;cassimere&#146;, a narrow twilled cloth made from Spanish wool mixed with silk, cotton, or mohair. Receptive to new technological developments, Anstie became a pioneer of his trade during the industrial revolution. He built in handsome classical style the first clothing factory in the west country, in Devizes in 1785. Here he installed spinning jennies, carding machines, and narrow hand-looms, also using scribbling mills and carding and spinning machines at nearby village watermills. In a pamphlet he wrote much later, <span class="italic">Observations on the importance and necessity of introducing improved machinery into the woollen manufactory</span> (1803), he stressed the necessity of mechanization to avoid loss of trade to Yorkshire and France. However, his progressive outlook was tempered by a humanity based on patriarchal conventions and a deep-seated nonconformist faith. Technical progress, he thought, should be &#145;combined with a just regard for the interest of the common people&#146;. He continued to use some domestic spinners and in 1787 arbitrated between Wiltshire narrow weavers and clothiers over the introduction of cassimere workshops.<br>
<br>Anstie was also heavily involved in European trade, from France to Russia; in 1793 he had &pound;17,500 of stock in continental agents' hands and supplied such monarchs as George III, Queen Charlotte, and Marie Antoinette. The wool export controversy of 1782&#150;8 made him a national political figure. He acted as chairman of the General Wool Meeting in London to oppose the wool growers' agitation, led by Sir Joseph Banks and Arthur Young, for the relaxation of the 1662 laws prohibiting wool export. Believing this would threaten the clothing trade, Anstie wrote three pamphlets, the most important of which was <span class="italic">A general view of a bill for preventing the illicit exportation of British wool and live sheep</span> (1787); in this he drew attention to the prevalence of the smuggling of British wool into other countries and the necessity for stricter government protection of the clothiers' interests. Amid rancour between the manufacturers and the landed interest, he played a major part in collecting evidence, lobbying parliament, and preparing the details of a new stringent <span class="roman">Wool Export Ban Bill</span>, which was passed in 1788, thus illustrating the manufacturers' growing influence on economic policy.<br>
<br>Because of his reputation as an authority on the cloth trade, Anstie was consulted, along with other leading manufacturers, by government ministers during the negotiations for commercial treaties with France and Ireland in 1784&#150;6, and he was used as a publicist in the west country for Pitt's free-trade policy. Despite his opposition to wool export, he was an economic liberal, believing in 1786 that it was important to open new markets for British goods; and describing himself in 1789 as &#145;being from principle an Enemy to restrictions on Trade&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 38570, fol. 55). Anstie was also involved in the campaign to improve the quality of British wool, writing <span class="italic">A letter to the secretary of the Bath Agricultural Society on the subject of a premium for the improvement of British wool</span> (1791). A man with strong scientific and mechanical interests, Anstie was also a member of the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, serving on its manufactures and commerce committee and becoming a vice-president of the society in 1788. He was familiar with leading contemporary figures such as the first marquess of Lansdowne, Lord Hawkesbury, Richard Arkwright, and Thomas Coke of Norfolk.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the financial crisis of 1793 and the problems in Europe during the French Revolution and the revolutionary war seriously affected Anstie's business, and he was declared bankrupt in December 1793. His later years were spent in Southwark, from about 1808, and also in Bristol; he died in Wilson Street, Bristol, in October 1830. He was buried in St Paul's churchyard, Bristol, on 2 November.<br>
