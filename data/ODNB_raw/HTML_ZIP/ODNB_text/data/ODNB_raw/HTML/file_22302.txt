<span class="headword">Pinkethman <span class="st"> [Penkethman, Pinkyman, Pinkerman]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660<span class="mult">x</span>65&#150;1725), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was probably born in London. The name Pinkethman is common in parish records of the period in London (St Clement Danes; St Andrew's, Holborn; St Bride's, Fleet Street), but nothing has been discovered of William's birth or parentage. If he was the Pinkiman Clark found in the <span class="italic">Belphegor</span> prompt book, playing a Servant at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin in 1677&#150;8, it seems unlikely that he was &#145;the same age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, no. 188, 22 June 1710) as his fellow actor William Bullock, who was probably born in 1666. After his first mention, as Stitchum in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Volunteers</span> in November 1692, Pinkyman or Pinkerman is recorded from time to time playing small parts at Drury Lane. When Thomas Betterton and the older members split from the United Company in 1694&#150;5, he stayed with Christopher Rich and soon took more significant roles. He was a popular speaker of prologues and epilogues, often delivered riding a donkey. Colley Cibber and others complained that Pinkethman sometimes gagged or extended business to the detriment of the play, but his standing continued to grow: by 1700 he was one of six members whose signatures appeared on business transactions for the company. A document of 1703 shows that his earnings were surpassed only by those of Thomas Doggett and Benjamin Johnson among the comic actors. He usually played at Drury Lane but, because of the divisions and reaffiliations of the companies, sometimes worked elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Tatler</span> jocularly compares the comic routines of Pinkethman and Bullock:<blockquote>Mr Bullock has the more agreeable squall, and Mr Penkethman the more graceful shrug. Penkethman devours a cold chick with great applause; Bullock's talent lies chiefly in sparrow grass. Penkethman is very dextrous at conveying himself under a table; Bullock is no less active at jumping over a stick; Mr Penkethman has a great deal of money, but Mr Bullock is the taller man. (<span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, no. 188, 22 June 1710)</blockquote>If he made &#145;a great deal of money&#146; it was perhaps mainly from drolls and farces and fair booths, and such &#145;diverting Entertainment&#146; as &#145;the Dancing Dogs, newly arriv'd from France&#146;  (Rosenfeld, 277) which accompanied a performance of Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> at Richmond. But Pinkethman was more than a knockabout comic and an astute businessman: he was a versatile and esteemed actor. He took over the part of Lory, the witty servant in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, when Doggett went back to Betterton's company, and he played the boisterous and duplicitous Sergeant Kite in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, as well as the rustic Appletree, the crusty Old Bellair in George Etherege's <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, and handsome &#145;shatterbrains&#146; Underplot in <span class="italic">Three Hours after Marriage</span>, by John Gay, Alexander Pope, and John Arbuthnot. The Dublin edition of this play records that, in the disguise scene, Pinkethman as crocodile manoeuvred his tail with such gusto that he knocked down Mrs Hunt (the maid, Sarsnet), displaying her underwear and legs to the delight of the audience. In helping her up, he became entangled with Colley Cibber in the mummy case, and the stage carpenter took half an hour to extricate them.<br>
<br>In old plays and the tragedies of his own time, Pinkethman took significant parts, in particular Abel Drugger, the small-minded tobacconist in <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>, the part Ben Jonson wrote with Robert Armin in mind and for which Garrick was later famous, and also Dapper, the lawyer's clerk. He was the good-natured poor gentleman Hearty in Richard Brome's <span class="italic">A Jovial Crew</span> and the &#145;humorous old Lord&#146; Calianax in Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span>. In Shakespeare and adaptations of Shakespeare he played Dr Caius in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, a Carter in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, the Chief Witch in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, the Poet in <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span>, the Gentleman Usher in Tate's <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and Polonius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. He was Antonio in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> and once played the title role in <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>, though more commonly he took the part of Daniel.<br>
<br>Pinkethman's entrepreneurial activities began in August 1698, when, with Blakes as a partner, he offered <span class="italic">Jephtha's Rash Vow</span> at Bartholomew fair. He ran booths at the fairs until the end of his life. Less than a month before his death he produced <span class="italic">Semiramis</span> with Henry Norris at Bartholomew fair, but did not perform. Downes wrote that Pinkethman &#145;has gain'd more in Theatres and Fairs in Twelve Years, than those that have Tugg'd at the Oar of Acting these fifty&#146;  (Downes, 108). Early in the eighteenth century he was hiring entertainments ranging from Italian mimes and French rope dancers to displays of horsemanship and gymnastics. A broadside published after the death of John Edwards, &#145;Horse Doctor and Merry Andrew&#146; (1706), implied that &#145;dull sneaking Pinkethman&#146; was too miserly to buy more than &#145;half a pint of ale&#146; to lament the death of his performer.<br>
<br>In February 1709, at the Duke of Marlborough's Head in Fleet Street, Pinkethman exhibited a &#145;moving picture&#146;&#151;a large landscape upon which animals, persons, coaches, and ships moved and appeared to diminish in perspective. In May it was removed to Greenwich, to the Hospital tavern, next door to the &#145;new Play-house&#146; where Pinkethman was trying a summer season while the London theatres were closed for part of each week. For the 1710 season he offered a &#145;subscription ticket&#146;, which for 1 guinea gave twenty-one admissions to performances, and could be used either singly or for parties. Performances were scheduled by the tides, so that watermen could bring passengers down on the ebb and take the incoming tide for the return to London. Pinkethman did not work at Greenwich after 1711. On 14 November 1714 he was a prisoner in the king's bench, presumably for debt, though whether because of the failure of one of his enterprises is not clear. He was free by 22 November, his wedding day.<br>
<br>In 1718 Pinkethman started a summer theatre at Richmond, &#145;for the Diversion of the Nobility and Quality that attend the Court of their Royal Highnesses&#146; the prince and princess of Wales. There he also exhibited a &#145;fine musical Picture&#146; of the royal family. Some of the best actors of both companies played at his theatre on Saturdays and Mondays, while also performing two week nights in London. In 1719 Pinkethman provided his own theatre in a converted donkey stable, and gave a special &#145;ass prologue&#146; for the occasion. With the beast beside him on stage he declared:<blockquote>
<div>But into Debt I'm got so very deep<br>
</div>
<div>My Creditors assure me they can't sleep,<br>
</div>
<div>Unless you stretch forth your kind Hands, what think ye?<br>
</div>
<div>Becomes of them, this House, and Bankrupt Pinky?<br>
</div>
<div>[and if they don't applaud]<br>
</div>
<div>And as this Place once more will come to th'Ass<br>
</div>
<div>Poor Penky'll be the Beast that's turned to Grass.<br>
</div> (Rosenfeld, 279)</blockquote>In the same season, shortly after Joseph Addison's death, a burlesque version of his tragedy <span class="italic">Cato</span> was performed, with Norris as Cato and Pinkethman as Juba. Politics were no doubt involved in this presentation &#145;for the entertainment of their Royal Highnesses&#146;, but some were offended. The summer seasons at Richmond continued, as did Pinkethman's regular playing at Drury Lane, until 1724, the year before he died. During this period was published <span class="italic">Pinkethman's Jests, or, Wit Defin'd</span> (1724, 2 parts), which had reached four editions by 1735.<br>
<br>The little information available about Pinkethman's private life leaves unsolved problems. He married Elizabeth Hill, of St Paul's, Shadwell, at Bow church on 22 November 1714, when he is recorded as a bachelor of the parish of St Paul, Covent Garden. Elizabeth died in 1720, and was buried at Richmond on 2 August. It does not appear that she had any children, and no record of any other marriage has been found. However, Pinkethman's son&#151;also William&#151;was a member of the Lincoln's Inn Fields company in 1722 and took some of his father's roles after his death. He was, presumably, the child of an earlier union. A &#145;Penkethman's widow&#146; is recorded as sharing in &#145;benefit nights&#146; at Drury Lane in 1726, 1727, and 1728.<br>
<br>Pinkethman was certainly successful. He had many friends, and there was little malicious gossip about him. Surviving portraits show a good-looking man, with the singing, dancing, and gymnastic skills needed by the comedian. He became &#145;of Richmond &hellip; Gentleman&#146; and owned a theatre and a house on Richmond Hill, where, on the king's birthday, he gave splendid parties, with &#145;a Barrel of Ale&#146; for the &#145;Commonalty&#146;. It was there, on 20 September 1725, that he died; he was buried at the parish church on 24 September. His will confirms a deed of gift of his property to Anne Atkins &#145;of Richmond &hellip; spinster&#146;. Was she, perhaps, &#145;Penkethman's widow&#146; who later shared in benefits at Drury Lane?<br>
