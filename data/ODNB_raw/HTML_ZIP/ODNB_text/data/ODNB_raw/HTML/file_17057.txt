<span class="headword">Lovell,  Daniel</span>  (1758/9&#150;1818), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was for many years proprietor and editor of <span class="italic">The Statesman</span> (1806&#150;24), a radical daily newspaper projected in 1806 by John Hunt. His outspoken criticism of the tories subjected him to much government persecution. In 1811 he was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment for copying the remarks of the Manchester papers on the conduct of the troops at Sir Francis Burdett's arrest, while the originators of the libel were only called upon to express regret at their carelessness.<br>
<br>In August 1812 Lovell was tried and found guilty of a libel on the commissioners of the transport service. He pleaded that it was published without his knowledge or sanction while he was in prison, but was sentenced to pay a fine of &pound;500, to be imprisoned in Newgate for eighteen months, and to find securities for three years, &pound;1000 on his own account and two sureties of &pound;500 each. Unable to pay the fine or find sureties, he remained in gaol.<br>
<br>At last on 23 November 1814, Samuel Whitbread MP presented a petition from Lovell asking for a remission or reduction of his fine, and after some time the government remitted the fine and reduced the amount of security; but he was still unable to obtain this, and on 17 March 1815 Whitbread again presented a petition from him, stating his complete inability to obtain the required security, and seeking the merciful consideration of the house of his sorry condition, having been confined nearly four years in Newgate. He was finally released, broken in health and financially ruined.<br>
<br>In 1817 Lovell was again heavily fined for speaking of the ministerial evening journal as &#145;the prostituted <span class="italic">Courier</span>, the venerable apostate of tyranny and oppression, whose full-blown baseness and infamy held him fast to his present connections and prevented him from forming new ones&#146;, while he further accused the editor, Daniel Stuart, of pocketing &pound;600 or &pound;700 of the Society of the Friends of the People. Lovell died aged sixty in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, London&#151;probably his business address&#151;on 27 December 1818, shortly after selling <span class="italic">The Statesman</span> to Sampson Perry, formerly editor of <span class="italic">The Argus</span>. He was buried at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 3 January 1819.<br>
<br>In his will, Lovell bequeathed an annuity of &pound;50 yearly to Ann Field, formerly Ann Hill, of whom he speaks as &#145;now residing with me&#146;. This wording indicates that it was unlikely that they were married, although Lovell goes on to speak of their son and daughter, born in 1810 and 1814 respectively.<br>
