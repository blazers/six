<span class="headword">Hallinan,  Hazel  Hunkins</span>  (1890&#150;1982), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 6 June 1890 at Aspen, Colorado, in the United States, the only daughter of Lewis Hunkins, civil war veteran, jeweller, and watchmaker, and Ann Whittingham, an English emigr&eacute;e. Hazel Hunkins was brought up in Billings, Montana. She later reflected that it was an early experience at the Episcopalian Church Sunday school which had provided her with her first awareness of gender difference. She recalled listening to a reading of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> and her dejection at the information that &#145;it only took a rib to make me while Adam was made in the image of God&#146;. She later concluded that &#145;In circumstances such as these little girls have from time immensurable been given a sense of inferiority&#146;  (SPG/HHH/M23 Fawcett Library). However, there was nothing inferior about Hunkins's scholastic achievements: she graduated from Vassar College in 1913 with an excellent degree in chemistry. She went on to lecture chemistry to freshmen at the University of Missouri for three years, with special reference to agricultural economics, and began her master's degree in chemistry. Prejudice at the university denied her promotion, despite her having higher qualifications than her male colleagues. Her professional ambitions were thwarted and her studies interrupted by traditional social expectations which compelled her to return home to nurse her critically ill mother. To relieve the tedium of this restricted domestic life she applied for a chemistry teaching post at Billings high school but was informed that only men would be considered for the post. However, she accepted a botany and geography position. Her experience of female subordination was endorsed when she attempted to gain employment as an industrial chemist. Her applications to chemistry laboratories throughout the country resulted in over 200 rejections: in every case the explanation offered was that they did not employ female chemists. She was twenty-six years old and desperate to make her contribution to society and be independent.<br>
<br>Such accumulated frustration was to find release when in the summer of 1916 Hunkins met Anna Louise Rowe, a member of the National Woman's Party (NWP), who was in Billings to establish NWP branches across Montana at the behest of the party's leader, Alice Paul. Hunkins's life as a political activist began with her organizing Billings's own NWP branch, becoming Montana state chair of the National Woman's Party, travelling around the state speaking at public meetings. But when the Democratic Party blocked the proposed equality legislation for women, NWP members concentrated all efforts on picketing the White House in Washington. Hunkins joined them. The women were subjected to physical violence and verbal abuse from crowds and police alike, while they stood silently holding their banners. To the horror of her family, from June 1917 Hunkins served several gaol sentences and took part in prison hunger strikes. She and her fellow women protesters claimed that as American citizens they were being held by their government as political prisoners.<br>
<br>It was soon after her final release from prison that Hunkins met Charles Thomas Hallinan (<i>d</i>. 1971) at a pacifist meeting where he was a speaker. Hunkins went to England in July 1920 to carry out research on the co-operative movement for the American Railway Brotherhood, and Charles Hallinan travelled there in November as the financial editor of United Press International. Hunkins and Hallinan then lived together in London and had four children. At the end of the 1920s they married. In this same spirit of independence Hunkins Hallinan adamantly declared that &#145;I have never in my life called myself Mrs Charles Hallinan. I have always had my own name&#146;  (Spender, 25).<br>
<br>During the course of her research on the co-operative movement, Hunkins Hallinan attended lectures at the London School of Economics to improve her knowledge of political and economic issues and was a member of the 1917 Club and attended Fabian socials. In London, she re-established her commitment to women's rights by joining the Six Point Group (SPG) in 1922. The SPG was a non-party political group formed in 1921 by Lady Rhondda (Margaret Haig) and its membership consisted of former militant suffragettes who were interested in practical action for social, economic, and political equality for women. During the 1920s and 1930s Hunkins Hallinan's friends numbered many of the leading feminists of the day including Crystal Eastman, Dora Russell, and Vera Brittain.<br>
<br>Hunkins Hallinan had various full- and part-time posts which utilized her economic and research experience. In London she became a sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Statesman's Yearbook</span> and was society correspondent of the <span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span> for fourteen years. Having been the SPG's honorary secretary for some time, during the 1950s Hunkins Hallinan became its chair and was prominent in the key campaigns of the period relating to women's employment rights, particularly equal pay and promotion rights. Her concern was not restricted to professional women, but included married women who were trying to combine work with family responsibilities. She was also a member of the Married Women's Association, although her perception of those family responsibilities was likely to have been somewhat limited by her class (she had sons at Oxford and Gordonstoun). By 1917 she was a member of the all-party parliamentary equal rights group which did much valuable groundwork for the anti-discrimination legislation of the 1970s. Birth control and abortion rights were also major interests and she worked with the Abortion Law Reform Association from the end of the 1960s.<br>
<br>Hunkins Hallinan had great admiration for the vitality of the new women's liberation movement. She had sustained her links with America through visits and speaking trips, but in 1973 she bridged the divide between the first and second waves of the women's movement by contacting the recently established National Organization for Women (NOW) in America. In a letter to NOW she declared that her twenty years as chairman of the SPG meant that &#145;My very modest distinction is that I am the only American woman who has achieved the chairmanship of a national organisation (British) without having climbed to that office through marriage to an English title!&#146;  (SPG:M19 Fawcett Library). It should be remembered, however, that by 1971 the SPG's membership had fallen to a modest 122. In 1977 Hunkins Hallinan marched with the NOW demonstration in Washington in support of the <span class="roman">Equal Rights Amendment</span> (first proposed in 1923 by her friend Alice Paul, at whose 1977 memorial day service she delivered the address) and was guest of honour at the White House when President Carter signed a women's equality day proclamation.<br>
<br>The early professional rebuffs Hunkins Hallinan experienced undoubtedly contributed to what her son Mark described as &#145;a very forceful personality&#146;. Her friend of fifty years Muriel Gray pointed out the contrast between her being &#145;tremendously courageous and very gutsy&#146; and her &#145;very small, feminine and pretty&#146; appearance. An SPG colleague recalled that &#145;She was a most energetic person and very determined. If she wanted to do a thing, she carried it through&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ham &amp; High</span>). Although she wrote numerous articles for magazines and newspapers, as well as a children's history of the United States, her most significant publishing contribution was to edit <span class="italic">In her Own Right</span>, a 1968 SPG book on the successes and remaining problems of women's emancipation.<br>
<br>Hazel Hunkins Hallinan died, aged ninety-one, of respiratory failure at her home, 15B Belsize Park Gardens in north London on 17 May 1982. Her body was returned to Billings, Montana, for burial next to her parents and husband.<br>
