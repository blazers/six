<span class="headword">Ross,  George, of Cromarty</span>  (1708/9&#150;1786), <span class="occ">army agent and agricultural improver</span>, was probably born on the small estate of Pitkerrie, Ross-shire, the only son of Andrew Ross (<i>fl</i>. 1670&#150;1710), proprietor of the estate. There is unresolved confusion as to the precise identity of his mother, a Catherine Fraser of the family of Fraser of Achnagairn, who after Andrew Ross's death married John Gray of Overskibo. A grandson of this second marriage, Alexander Gray (<i>c</i>.1741&#150;1820), became Ross's business partner in London and ultimately his heir.<br>
<br>Ross trained as a lawyer and worked for a number of years in Edinburgh and London as confidential clerk to Duncan Forbes of Culloden, lord president of the court of session. This appointment may have come about through family connections, since Forbes's sister was married to a Fraser of Achnagairn, a relative of Ross's mother. Forbes assisted Archibald Campbell, third duke of Argyll, who dominated Scottish politics from the mid-1720s through a system of patronage dispensed on a grand scale. Thus Ross, though a minor figure, was well placed in the web of politics and patronage. On 20 April 1738 he married Rachael Kellow of Broad Street, Golden Square, London; she died in 1742. He seems to have inherited land or money from his wife, since one of Forbes's acquaintances remarked that &#145;if the stories told of her are true &hellip; [Ross] has not any loss by her going&#146;  (Menary, 335). The couple had one son, John, who died childless about 1775.<br>
<br>After Forbes's death in 1747, Ross continued in London, doing business from his residence in Conduit Street. By 1754, under the patronage of Argyll, he had become London agent for two Scottish bodies&#151;the convention of royal burghs and the board of trustees for manufactures and fisheries. An attempt was made by Argyll's faction in 1755 to have him appointed to a further London agency, the commissioners of the annexed estates, but this failed. In addition to enjoying the patronage of Argyll, Ross was a close friend both of General William Amherst, brother of the future commander-in-chief of Great Britain, and of the Scottish-born Lord Chief Justice William Murray (1705&#150;1793), later first earl of Mansfield. Such influential connections enabled Ross to build up a business during the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63) as an army or military agent, contracting to supply regiments with equipment and stores. The agency grew further during the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>In the 1760s, having amassed a considerable fortune, Ross acquired properties in Surrey and the West Indies, and began buying up both land and feudal superiorities in the north of Scotland. He improved the estate of Kinmylies, in Inverness-shire, and was credited with being only the second proprietor in the county to use improved farming methods. In 1766 he assisted Lord Elibank in the purchase of the Cromarty estate and in the legal transactions that enabled Elibank to have his nephew, William Pulteney, elected MP for the county in 1768. The estate was then sold to Ross, reputedly at a discounted price  (NAS GD 305/1/159). Ross's legal title to the Cromarty estate was not complete until 1772, but he was in effective control from 1767 until his death in 1786. During this time he spent considerable sums on improvements in agriculture and commerce, and on the embellishment of the estate so that it might become &#145;worth an Englishman's while coming all the way from London to see&#146;  (Miller, 431). Ross's improvements all exhibited a flair for organization, bringing together his political contacts, his knowledge of markets in London and the West Indies, his acquaintance with leading architects and engineers, and his insights into improved agriculture in the south of England.<br>
<br>Central to his plans was the establishment in the early 1770s of a non-mechanized proto-factory, which used imported Baltic hemp to produce cloth for sacking and bagging, all of which was shipped to London for use in the West Indian trade. The factory employed between 200 and 250 workers in the buildings and more than 600 outworkers. Ross also secured government funds for the construction of a harbour (1782&#150;4), designed by the leading civil engineer James Smeaton; opened a brewery (<i>c</i>.1772), which was one of the largest in the north of Scotland; built a court house (1772&#150;3) for the county of Cromarty, partly at his own expense and partly with government support; and, unusually for the time, erected a church (1784) specifically for Gaelic speakers who had come from the neighbouring parishes to seek employment in the town. In these ventures he worked closely with the leading local merchant William Forsyth (1722&#150;1800).<br>
<br>Ross demolished Cromarty Castle, built an elegant mansion in its place (1772&#150;4), and carried out extensive landscaping of the surrounding policies. The house had an unusual tunnel below the gardens&#151;a &#145;tradesman's entrance&#146; through which deliveries might be made to the kitchens. Ross commissioned plans from the architect John Adam for a new parish church in Cromarty: while this was not built, it has been suggested that Adam may have had some influence in the building of Cromarty House. Ross's agricultural improvements followed the common pattern of consolidating, enlarging, and enclosing farms. More unusually, from Buckinghamshire he brought ploughmen and their wives, who taught lacemaking, and he also established a large-scale pig-rearing venture. This included a custom-built &#145;hog yard&#146;, the only one of its kind in Scotland, with breeding, feeding, and slaughtering areas. The pork was salted and, like the bagging produced in the factory, was almost entirely destined for the West Indies.<br>
<br>Ross became MP for the county of Cromarty in 1780. In parliament he allied himself with Lord North whom he followed into opposition in 1782; his support for the personalities of the Fox&#150;North coalition continued during Pitt's ministry. Since the holding of an army agency was a disqualification from sitting in the House of Commons, he retired from the agency in favour of his partner, his half-nephew Alexander Gray of Overskibo. By this point the agency was under contract to twenty-one regiments, and a decade later, after Ross's death, the annual turnover was in excess of &pound;1 million. Towards the end of his life, however, Ross sustained a substantial financial loss through the failure of John Fraser, a London merchant to whom he was related through his mother. Fraser's debts of over &pound;90,000 included some &pound;43,000 owed to Ross.<br>
<br>In the absence of any personal papers it is difficult to form an impression of Ross's character. The management of his estate was benevolent, with no eviction of tenants and several acts of generosity, including building houses for the poor and erecting the Gaelic chapel. Hugh Miller refers to a surviving portrait of Ross and the &#145;air of dignified benevolence impressed on the features of the handsome old man&#146;  (Miller, 429). Ross's dignity appeared to others to be excessive. The <span class="italic">Times</span> columnist Junius, who was fiercely critical of Mansfield's alleged favouritism towards fellow Scots, wrote of Ross's role in one particular case of back-room dealing, remarking that &#145;no sale by the candle was ever conducted with greater formality&#146;  (ibid.). There is a similar suggestion that Ross had a developed sense of his own importance in a letter from John Mackenzie of Delvin, clerk of the signet, who referred to him with uncharacteristic sharpness as &#145;the wise and great, and by just consequence, the rich George Ross&#146;  (Fraser-Mackintosh, 235). It should be noted that Ross's son reputedly died by shooting himself, in Cromarty House, following a quarrel with his father over the correct way to carve a joint of meat, Ross having remarked that &#145;little men cannot afford to neglect little matters&#146;  (Miller, 437).<br>
<br>Having sat between 1780 and 1784 for Cromarty, in March 1786 Ross was elected MP for the Northern burghs, only to die at Richmond, Surrey, on 7 April of that year. He was buried as requested in the grounds of Richmond church.<br>
