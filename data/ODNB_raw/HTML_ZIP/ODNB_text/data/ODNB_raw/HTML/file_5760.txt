<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baillie,  Alexander Dundas Ross  Cochrane-Wishart-</span>, first Baron Lamington  (1816&#150;1890), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born on 24 November 1816, the younger of the two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5758/', "Admiral Sir Thomas John Cochrane GCB (1789&#150;1872)")</script> and his first wife, Matilda, daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Lockhart-Ross, seventh baronet, of Balnagowan, and his first wife, Matilda Theresa, Countess Lockhart Wishart of the Holy Roman empire; his mother, who died in 1819, took the married name Cochrane Wishart. Until 1880 his formal name was Alexander Dundas Wishart Ross Baillie-Cochrane, but on his elevation to the barony of Lamington he changed his surname to Cochrane-Wishart-Baillie. He is commonly referred to by historians as Cochrane-Baillie, the form of name used by his son and his descendants.<br>
<br>Cochrane (or Kok as he was nicknamed) was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1837), where he was president of the union in his last year. By 1837 he had inherited the desolate estate of Lamington near Biggar in Lanarkshire, in direct descent through the female line. He greatly improved the estate and the welfare of its dependants, building sturdy, plain-Gothic cottages that outlived Lamington House itself.<br>
<br>On 4 December 1844, Cochrane married Annabella Mary Elizabeth Drummond (1824&#150;1917), daughter of Andrew Drummond, of Cadlands, Hampshire, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Drummond, Lord John Manners's sister; they had three daughters, Constance Mary Elizabeth, Amy Augusta Frederica Annabella, and Violet Marie Louise, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30531/', "Charles Wallace Alexander Napier Ross Cochrane-Baillie")</script>, who succeeded his father as second baron.<br>
<br>By early 1841 Cochrane was a leading member, with Lord John Manners and G. S. Smythe, of what Disraeli by then was calling &#145;Young England&#146;; in late January (according to Manners's journal) he went with a boisterous group to Canterbury to support Smythe's electoral bid. An incident in a public house resulted in his appearance before a magistrate. In the general election that summer, he stood unsuccessfully at Bridport as a Conservative, but was elected in September as a Liberal-Conservative. He made his maiden speech on 20 September of that year, opposing an increase in the grant for Maynooth College in Ireland. According to a letter from Cochrane's son in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 25 February 1890, Peel offered him a post shortly after his election. Although Cochrane was less enthusiastic than the others about Disraeli, in October 1842 in Paris he and Smythe reached an informal agreement with him, and subsequently with Manners, that the Young England group would act together in parliament. Cochrane was not, however, a strong party man; he never wavered on matters such as Young England's opposition to the new poor law, but on other issues, especially protectionism, he vacillated. Having in November 1844 predicted that repeal of the corn laws would cause a revolution, on 9 February 1846 he declared himself in favour of repeal, and tried to appear consistent by arguing that he now favoured protection for all classes. In March 1846 he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds and stood for re-election at Bridport as a Peelite; he won by one vote, but on 27 April was unseated on petition. In the general election of 1847 he regained the seat, and held it until 1852.<br>
<br>In the 1852 general election Cochrane was defeated at Southampton, and shortly thereafter approached Disraeli, now chancellor of the exchequer, for &#145;any appointment in or under the government&#146;, citing his qualities of &#145;Earnestness, Zeal &amp; Love of Labour&#146;. Disraeli responded with &#145;expressions of good will&#146;, but the government fell before anything came of it  (Disraeli, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, vol. 6, letter 2350 n1). In January 1853 he was again defeated at Southampton. On 5 January 1857 he was returned unopposed at a by-election for Lanarkshire, only to be defeated on 7 April in the general election. On 29 April 1859 he was elected at Honiton, and represented it until 1868. From 1864 to 1868, he was joint editor and writer for <span class="italic">The Owl</span>, a popular satirical weekly.<br>
<br>When the third Derby administration was formed in June 1866 Cochrane was again disappointed of place, although Disraeli told him he had given Derby a list with his name on it. In September 1867 Manners expressed concern to Disraeli that Cochrane was going to have his seat &#145;cut from under him by the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>&#146;. Disraeli apparently offered him something, for in December Manners reported that Cochrane was grateful but reluctant to give up public life in England. A year later Disraeli offered him (possibly for the second time) the governorship of Cape Colony, but again the government fell before a decision was made. In the general election in November 1868 Cochrane was defeated in the Isle of Wight, but he was returned for that seat in 1870 and 1874. In September 1876 he was appointed a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery. He did not stand for re-election in 1880, and Disraeli (now Lord Beaconsfield), in his last days in office, recommended him for a peerage; on 3 May 1880 he was created Baron Lamington.<br>
<br>Cochrane published widely. His early <span class="italic">Poems</span> (privately printed 1838) were followed by <span class="italic">The Morea</span> (1840). He wrote four novels, <span class="italic">Ernest Vane</span> (1849), in which George Smythe figured as the character George Percy, <span class="italic">Lucille Belmont</span> (1849), <span class="italic">Florence the Beautiful</span> (1854), and, under the pseudonym of Leonard Holme, <span class="italic">A Young Artist's Life</span> (1864); several pamphlets, including <span class="italic">Exeter Hall</span> (1841), <span class="italic">Young Italy</span> (1850), <span class="italic">Who are the Liberals?</span> (1852), and <span class="italic">Justice to Scotland</span> (1854); and several historical works&#151;<span class="italic">Historic Pictures</span> (2 vols., 1865), <span class="italic">Francis the First</span> (2 vols., 1870), <span class="italic">Historic Ch&acirc;teaux</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">The Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais in the Time of Louis XV</span> (1879). He contributed to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> between 1881 and 1890, the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> in 1883, the <span class="italic">National Review</span> in 1883 and 1884, and the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> in 1884; the last piece was an anonymous article, &#145;Forty years of parliament&#146;, by &#145;A Young England peer&#146;, blaming the decline of parliament on the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>.<br>
<br>Lamington died on 15 February 1890, of influenza, at 26 Wilton Crescent, his London residence; on 20 February he was buried at Lamington in the episcopal chapel of the Holy Trinity which he himself had built. At the time, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> was running his reminiscences, &#145;In the days of the dandies&#146; (reprinted as a book later in 1890), concluding in March with &#145;The Young England party&#146;.<br>
<br>Cochrane is of importance primarily as a gifted member of Young England, the original of Buckhurst in Disraeli's <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> (1844), where he is portrayed as a &#145;most energetic &hellip; fiery and generous &hellip; reckless genius&#146;. He was the eldest, the richest, and most Byronic of the group, with an impetuous, generous, self-assured, open nature, and an elegant and sophisticated manner. According to Richard Faber, Cochrane's writings show him to have been also the most heterosexual of the group. Independent by nature, he did not see himself as a central figure in the party, though he shared the group's belief in the need to address the &#145;condition of England question&#146; by what in 1884 he called &#145;progressive Conservatism&#146;. He admired Peel, and his political heroes were Canning and Castlereagh, but in the group his favourite was the mercurial Smythe (who in 1844 reciprocated by dallying in Koblenz with a woman he calls merely &#145;Cochrane's Green Gage&#146;). He was prominent both in parliament and in society, especially in literary circles; he was highly regarded as an expert on Greece and Italy (he was knight of the Order of St Saviour of Greece), and after his death was fondly remembered as a &#145;kindly, cultivated country gentleman&#146; (in 1883 his estates totalled 12,708 acres, worth nearly &pound;12,000 a year). Although his life was full and productive, his career left a sense of failure, given the high expectations his talents aroused.<br>
