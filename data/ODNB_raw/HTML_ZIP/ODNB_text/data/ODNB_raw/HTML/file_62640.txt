<span class="headword">Birmingham family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1135&#150;<em>c.</em>1300), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, were lords of Birmingham, Warwickshire, Hoggeston, Buckinghamshire, and Shutford, Oxfordshire, and were important tenants and retainers of the lords of Dudley. The earliest known member of the family is William [i] of Birmingham (<i>fl</i>. 1135), who may have been of Norman origins, but his son <a name="cosubject_62634"></a><span class="headword">Peter  of Birmingham</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1174)<span class="occ"></span> is the first about whom much is known. Peter occurs as a witness to a charter of Henry, duke of Normandy, the future Henry II, granting rights to the bishop of Lichfield in 1153/4. Peter is described as steward of Dudley, and was probably representing his master Gervase Pagnell. In 1166 it was recorded that Peter was holding nine knights' fees of Gervase, making him easily the greatest of the tenants of the honour of Dudley. The lands which made up these fees comprised at least ten manors, all but Hoggeston within a few miles of Dudley. Also in 1166 Peter was granted a royal charter of confirmation for a market at Birmingham, adjacent to his castle there. The castle was presumably on the same site as the later manor house, but archaeological excavation has not confirmed this. In 1168 Peter appears in the pipe roll accounting for the pannage of Cannock Forest, Staffordshire, and the following year was supervising work on the bridge at Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire. He died before 1174 and was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_62635"></a><span class="headword">William [ii]  of Birmingham</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1174&#150;1210)<span class="occ"></span>, often styled William fitz Peter. Another son, Hugh fitz Peter (<i>fl</i>. 1174&#150;1210), was granted lands at Bushbury, Upper Penn, and Rushall, Staffordshire, held from his brother as one and a half knights' fees. It is possible that the Robert of Bermingham who was a follower of Earl Richard fitz Gilbert (Strongbow) during the conquest of Ireland in 1169&#150;71 and was granted land at Tethmory, Offaly, was also Peter's son, but this cannot be proved.<br>
<br>During the 1174 uprising against Henry II Gervase Pagnell rebelled, but, in a notable example of a principal tenant turning against his nominal lord, William fitz Peter commanded a party of knights garrisoning the motte of Warwick Castle for the king. William married Margery de Malpas, whose family were tenants of the earls of Chester, and through her acquired land in Cheshire. In 1191 he went on the third crusade. William fitz Peter was succeeded by his eldest son, Brian of Birmingham (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1222), but Brian died soon after his father leaving no children of his own and was in turn succeeded by his brother <a name="cosubject_62637"></a><span class="headword">William [iii]  of Birmingham</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1222&#150;1242)<span class="occ"></span>. William [iii] and a third brother, Henry of Birmingham, were in litigation regarding demesne land at Morfe, Staffordshire, which Henry subsequently held from his brother as a quarter of a knight's fee. William [iii] married Sybil de Colville and through her acquired two small manors in Buckinghamshire and Berkshire. The marriage produced at least four sons: <a name="cosubject_62638"></a><span class="headword">William [iv]  of Birmingham</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1242&#150;1263)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father; Brian (<i>fl</i>. 1254&#150;1262); Robert (<i>fl</i>. 1252&#150;1262); and Roger (<i>fl</i>. 1262). Brian was a knight, but Robert and Roger were clerics, respectively rectors of Hoggeston and Enville in Staffordshire. William [iv], Brian, and Robert all accompanied Henry III on the 1254 expedition to Gascony. William [iv] married Maud of Gatcombe (<i>fl</i>. 1242&#150;1283) whose dowry was Shutford, Oxfordshire. In 1249 he received a life exemption from serving on assizes, juries, or recognitions, an acknowledgement of favour and enhanced status; and it is probably to his lifetime that the impressive masonry work found during excavation of the site of the manor house at Birmingham belongs. In 1262 he was impleaded by Roger de Somery, lord of Dudley, regarding the extent of the services owed for his lands. William was a supporter of Simon de Montfort, marrying his son, <a name="cosubject_62639"></a><span class="headword">William [v]  of Birmingham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1265)<span class="occ"></span>, to Isabel of Astley, the daughter of Montfort's steward Thomas of Astley, and the granddaughter of Arnold du Bois, another Montfort associate. William [v] fought for Montfort at Evesham on 4 August 1265 where he was killed with many others of Montfort's household knights. His demesne lands and the wardship of his infant son <a name="cosubject_62640"></a><span class="headword">William [vi]  of Birmingham</span>  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1302)<span class="occ"></span> were granted by Henry III to Roger de Clifford, but both lands and child were subsequently redeemed under the terms of the dictum of Kenilworth by Roger de Somery.<br>
<br>William [vi] reached his majority by 1283 but suffered huge financial difficulties. His grandmother and stepfather had life interests in a substantial part of his demesne land, he was indebted to his former guardian Roger de Somery for redemption moneys paid on his behalf, and some redemption fines had never been paid. Small wonder that he sought to avoid the burdens of knighthood; but in 1286 he was judged to have evaded and was fined accordingly. Bowing to the inevitable, he was dubbed knight and in 1297 fought in the Gascony campaign where he was captured and eventually ransomed. He died in 1302, still burdened by debt.<br>
<br>Dugdale refers to a seal, which he claimed to be that of Peter of Birmingham, showing a shield of arms, a bend lozenge on a plain field. The arms which his descendants bore during the thirteenth century were azure a bend lozenge or, and if they were indeed borne by Peter he would be one of the earliest examples of an armigerous knight. The Birmingham family were active patrons of commerce. In 1189 another confirmation charter was secured for the market at Birmingham, and by the end of the twelfth century there are already indications that it was growing into a small town. In 1232 the townsmen came to an agreement with William [iii] of Birmingham regarding rents and labour services; and in 1250 William [iv] was granted confirmation for a three-day spring fair held at the town. By the second half of the thirteenth century Birmingham was recognizably a borough with burgesses, bailiffs, a court, and bounds which set it apart from the manorial lands of its founders. The relationship between a leading family of knights and an urban foundation is rare, and marks out the Birminghams as highly enterprising&#151;an enterprise that may account for the abandonment of their Dudley allegiance for the king in 1174 and for Montfort in 1265.<br>
