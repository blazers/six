<span class="headword">Thompson,  Edward</span>  (1738?&#150;1786), <span class="occ">naval officer and author</span>, was the son of a Hull merchant about whom further details are unknown. He was educated at Beverley and Hampstead, and made a voyage to Greenland in 1750. He journeyed to the East Indies in an Indiaman in 1754, and later claimed that he was pressed out of her and into the navy. On his return to England he joined the <i>Stirling Castle</i> (64 guns, Captain Samuel Cornish), and was made a midshipman. He was promoted lieutenant on 16 November 1757 and joined the <i>Jason</i>, serving in the North Sea and the English Channel. In May 1758 he joined the <i>Dorsetshire</i> (70 guns, Captain Peter Denis). The <i>Dorsetshire</i> was employed on the Brest blockade and Thompson was present at the battle of Quiberon Bay (20 November 1759). In March 1760 he moved with Captain Denis to the new <i>Bellona</i> (74 guns), attached to the western squadron, and was put on half pay at the end of the war in 1763.<br>
<br>After the peace Thompson devoted his time to writing. During the remainder of his life he acquired a wide circle of political and literary acquaintances including John Wilkes, David Garrick, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan whom he apparently detested, describing him as a &#145;parliamentary impostor and swindler&#146;  (&#145;Journal&#146;, 632). His satires <span class="italic">The Demi-Rep</span> (1756) and <span class="italic">The Meretriciad</span> (1763), published anonymously, proved very popular, the former recounting the attractions of London society and its corrupting moral influence. These and several other pieces were collected in 1770 under the title <span class="italic">The Court of Cupid</span>. In 1767 <span class="italic">A Sailor's Letters</span> was published in two volumes. These described Thompson's voyages from 1754 to 1759 along with an account of the battle of Quiberon Bay and a vivid depiction of life in the navy. However, they also tend towards exaggeration and are not wholly reliable as illustrations of naval life (Rodger, 171, 181; Marcus, 183, 185).<br>
<br>Thompson was promoted commander on 10 January 1771 and appointed to the <i>Kingfisher</i> in the North Sea and, at the end of the year, to the <i>Raven</i> in the Mediterranean. Here he was promoted captain of the <i>Niger</i> by Rear-Admiral Sir Peter Denis, and his commission was confirmed by the Admiralty on 2 April 1772. He returned to England and the <i>Niger</i> was paid off in July 1772. The following year Thompson produced an adaptation of Charles Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Fair Quaker</span> at Drury Lane. Typically its naval characters, such as the macaroni Captain Mizen, were &#145;only fit to seduce their brother officers wives&#146;  (Langford, 577). Notwithstanding some popular success, much of Thompson's literary output and particularly his verse &#145;barely soared up to&#146; mediocrity. He was fond of puns and doggerel and would frequently pen a few lines on the death of someone in the public eye  (&#145;Journal&#146;, 614, 619). Even so, on an occasion when one of his plays was being staged in Plymouth, fifty of his crew arrived at the door of the theatre and demanded admittance. As well as composing Thompson was engaged in editing the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span> and later the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>. He considered standing for parliament and in 1773 was proposed by John Wilkes as candidate for Westminster in opposition to Charles Fox, but Wilkes found no seconder. He later considered standing for Camelford but despite some encouragement never took up a political career.<br>
<br>In January 1778 Thompson was appointed to the <i>Hyaena</i> (24 guns), a new frigate building at Fisher's yard in Liverpool. He commissioned her on 17 April, and early the following year went out to Barbados. The <i>Hyaena</i> was attached to John Byron's fleet and present at the inconclusive action with d'Estaing off Grenada on 6 July 1779. In August he was persuaded at the insistence of some merchants at Barbados to leave his station and return to England with a convoy. For this he was court martialled but acquitted. In December the <i>Hyaena</i> was attached to the fleet under Sir George Rodney that was sent to the relief of Gibraltar. Thompson was present at the moonlight battle off Cape St Vincent (16&#150;17 January 1780), when Rodney engaged a Spanish fleet. In a letter dated 24 March 1780 George Jackson, second secretary of the Admiralty, informed Rodney of Thompson's &#145;good Judgement&#146;, his reputation as &#145;an excellent Companion&#146;, and of his being &#145;unfortunate in his Marriage&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/20/26/3, p. 17); further details of Thompson's wife are unknown though his journal also refers to another woman, Emma, with whom he spent much time towards the end of his life.<br>
<br>The <i>Hyaena</i> was afterwards sent home with dispatches following the moonlight battle. After refitting she was sent in August to New York with a convoy and then back to Barbados. In 1781, on the surrender of the Dutch territories of Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo, Thompson was delegated to organize the establishment of the new colonies. By September he was under orders from Rodney to take a convoy to England with the admiral's dispatches but had received no written confirmation. Rodney had already returned to England leaving Hood in command. Thompson took it on his own responsibility to take the convoy to England and in his absence the Guiana colonies were recaptured by the French. On 1 April 1782 he was again court martialled, &#145;on the letter of Sir Samuel Hood&#146;, for deserting his station but was once more acquitted (Popham, 12; TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5319, fol. 555).<br>
<br>Professionally Thompson was on very good terms with both admirals Augustus Keppel and Richard Howe; as both were successively at the head of the Admiralty after the American War of Independence, Thompson managed to find employment at sea. Although his scheme for a new signal code received nothing more than &#145;a polite reply&#146; from Howe, his plans to survey the west coast of Africa obtained support  (&#145;Journal&#146;, 636). He planned to explore the coast between 20&deg; S and 30&deg; S and proposed a settlement where Indiamen might call to refit. Thompson was appointed to command the <i>Grampus</i> (50 guns) and in January 1784 sailed with instructions to survey the trading forts on the Guinea coast. The <i>Grampus</i> stopped at Madeira, where Thompson was inspired to write the poem <span class="italic">Belle Monte</span>. Thompson also kept a painter by the name of Wilson on board to make a number of sketches of the island.<br>
<br>Thompson conducted his surveys off the African coast, and gathered much information on commercial activities and the slave trade as well as settling trading disputes between the Europeans and the local leaders. He also reported on the depredations of pirate vessels, and an attempt by the Danes to build a fort on the River Volta to secure a large part of the British slave trade to themselves. Suffering from fever he returned to England in September 1784, but the following year he sailed again to the African coast. In company with the <i>Nautilus</i> (16 guns), the <i>Grampus</i> was ordered to survey the south-west coast of Africa. A further object of the voyage was to select a suitable site north of the Cape for a penal colony. Once it was established, Thompson expected to be appointed its governor. Before carrying out these instructions both ships returned to the Guinea coast to complete the work of the previous year. Thompson was again involved in settling disputes but fell ill during the negotiations. On this occasion the fever proved fatal and he died on board the <i>Grampus</i> on 17 January 1786. The following day he was buried at sea in the Gulf of Guinea, the ceremony accompanied by minute guns from the <i>Grampus</i> and <i>Nautilus</i>, and a volley of small arms.<br>
<br>Thompson was very popular with his crew, and took great care in the nautical education of his young officers. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27279/', "Thomas Boulden Thompson")</script> and Home Riggs Popham served on the quarterdeck of the <i>Grampus</i> and both became officers of some distinction. In character, he was described as &#145;an agreeable and gentlemanlike companion&#146;, and his reputation as a wit, as well as his writing and literary activities in London society, earned him the nickname Poet Thompson throughout the navy  (Stirling, 20).<br>
