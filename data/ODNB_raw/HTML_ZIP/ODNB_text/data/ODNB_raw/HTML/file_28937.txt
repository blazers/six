<span class="headword">Weber,  Henry William</span>  (1783&#150;1818), <span class="occ">literary scholar and secretary</span>, was born on 22 September 1783 at St Petersburg, the second of three children of H. W. Weber (<i>d</i>. 1786), merchant and commissioner for trade, and Dorothy Foster (<i>d</i>. 1816), relative of Henry Lord Holland and niece of Joseph Foster-Barham MP. Weber's father was a native of Neustadt, Westphalia, and a member of the Moravian Brethren community in St Petersburg. Most of Weber's German and English relatives belonged to the Moravian communities at Herrnhut in Saxony and at Bedford and Fulneck near Leeds in England.<br>
<br>In 1795 Weber was briefly enrolled at an &eacute;lite Moravian boarding-school at Uhyst in Saxony, before the family left Germany for England in 1797. In 1803&#150;4 he enrolled in medicine at the University of Edinburgh, continuing his studies at the University of Halle in 1805 and the University of Jena in 1806. After the university at Jena was temporarily closed in 1806 following the defeat of the Prussian army by Napoleonic forces, he returned to Edinburgh to study. From 1807 to 1814 he worked as an amanuensis and secretary, primarily for Sir Walter Scott, and it was during this period that Weber's literary and scholarly career flourished, with all his published works dating from these years.<br>
<br>Scott described Weber as &#145;a man of very superior attainments, an excellent linguist and geographer, and a remarkable antiquary&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was widely read in medieval romance literature, both British and European, and had personally studied more than three-quarters of the fifty-six Middle English romances known about 1800  (Gamerschlag, 212). In 1808 he published an edition of <span class="italic">The Battle of Floddon Field: a Poem of the Sixteenth Century</span>, celebrating a historical event that Scott recounted in the sixth canto of <span class="italic">Marmion</span> (1808). This was followed by his <span class="italic">Metrical Romances of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Centuries</span>, with introduction, notes, and glossary (3 vols., 1810), described by Southey as &#145;admirably edited&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections from the Letters</span>, 2.308) and considered by modern scholars as Weber's major work  (Mitchell, 8&#150;10).<br>
<br>Weber's next publication, <span class="italic">Dramatic Works of John Ford</span>, with introduction and explanatory notes (2 vols., 1811), was not of such high quality and aroused a storm of angry comment, including pamphlets by Octavius Gilchrist, G. D. Whittington, and the Revd John Mitford. The criticism stemmed from the fact that Weber was not skilled in early modern English literature and had not collated the early editions of the plays. Similar problems beset his <span class="italic">Works of Beaumont and Fletcher</span>, with introduction and explanatory notes (14 vols., 1812), which Scott, whose own annotated edition had supplied the most valuable notes, acknowledged to have been &#145;carelessly done&#146;. However, Dyce, in his <span class="italic">Works of Beaumont and Fletcher</span>  (1843, 1.iii) considered it as &#145;on the whole the best edition of the dramatists which had yet appeared&#146;.<br>
<br>Weber's next publication was <span class="italic">Tales of the East; comprising the most popular romances of oriental origin and the best imitations by European authors</span> (3 vols., 1812). He also edited <span class="italic">A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland</span> in 1813. In 1814, in collaboration with Robert Jamieson, Weber produced another significant work of scholarship in <span class="italic">Illustrations of Northern Antiquities from the Earlier Teutonic and Scandinavian Romances</span>. At one time the two scholars had intended to establish a new periodical devoted to &#145;ancient Romance and Antiquities in general&#146;  (H. Weber to F. Douce, 31 Jan 1810), but lack of support forced them to compromise on this one-volume collection of medieval European romances, illuminated by interpretative essays. Scott contributed an abstract of the Old Icelandic <span class="italic">Eyrbyggja saga</span>, taken from Thorkelin's Latin edition and translation of 1787. Weber's contribution to the volume included a historical sketch of medieval Germanic poetry and romance and English summary translations of <span class="italic">Das Nibelungenlied</span> and <span class="italic">Das Heldenbuch</span>. His essay on medieval romance in Germany and Scandinavia was one of the sources of Scott's later &#145;Essay on romance&#146; (1824).<br>
<br>Scott's attitude to Weber seems to have been ambivalent; he described him as &#145;an excellent and affectionate creature&#146; but &#145;a violent Jacobin&#146;, and Scott admitted he used to taunt him about his political views. He also wrote that Weber was &#145;afflicted with partial insanity especially if he used strong liquors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 110). The Scott family, with whom Weber often dined, liked his appearance and manners, and enjoyed his conversation. In early 1814, however, Weber apparently suffered a breakdown while resident in Scott's household, which brought his career as the latter's secretary to an abrupt end. At the close of a day's work in the same room as his employer, he suddenly appeared to become mentally disturbed, produced a pair of loaded pistols, and challenged Scott to a duel. Scott managed to calm Weber down, even to the point of inviting him to dine with the family that evening. Surreptitiously, however, he had made arrangements for Weber to be restrained and straitjacketed. After this the two men never again met, although they corresponded, but Scott apparently made a substantial contribution to Weber's support in the mental asylums in which he spent a good part of the rest of his life. This breakdown was apparently in part a consequence of what Weber called a &#145;fever&#146;, which may have come on after a strenuous walking tour of the highlands, for which he had been hired to act as a guide for a rich Jamaican named Johnstone. The two men had become very drunk at the duke of Sutherland's Dunrobin Castle, an incident that is likely to have embarrassed Scott and caused him to restrict Weber's drinking in what was probably a humiliating way, further contributing to his eventual breakdown.<br>
<br>In March 1814 Weber returned with his mother to the Moravian community at Fulneck. He later accompanied his sister and her children to London, doubtless with the intention of working in libraries there, but, despite his family connections, Weber was unable to secure any regular employment, and he eventually returned to Fulneck and then to York. The loss of his mother in 1816 compounded his mental and physical deterioration, and on 17 October 1816 he was admitted to the York Lunatic Asylum. There he died on 25 March 1818 of an epileptic attack after suffering prolonged atrophy and dementia.<br>
