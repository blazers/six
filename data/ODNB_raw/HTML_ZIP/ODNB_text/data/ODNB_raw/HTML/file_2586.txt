<span class="headword">Blakeley,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>William Stone Baseley]</span>  (1830&#150;1897), <span class="occ">actor</span>, of whose early life nothing is known, played as an amateur at the Gough Street Theatre (later pulled down) and at the Soho Theatre (later named the Royalty). His first professional appearance was at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, with Sir William Don. At the Amphitheatre, Liverpool, he performed as Polonius and in other parts, and he accompanied Edward Sothern on tour, playing Asa Trenchard to his Lord Dundreary in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span>. He made his London d&eacute;but on 21 December 1867 at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Tottenham Street, as Sir Abel Hotspur in Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">How She Loves Him</span>, having played the same role at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Liverpool, in 1863. Among his most notable parts in the next few years were that of the original Bodmin Todder in T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">Play</span>, John Chodd senior in a revival of the same author's <span class="italic">Society</span>, and Mr Tweedie in Yates's <span class="italic">Tame Cats</span>.<br>
<br>After accompanying Sothern to America in 1880, Blakeley appeared at the Criterion on 23 July 1881 as Jeremiah Deeds in <span class="italic">Flats in Four Stories</span> (<span class="italic">Les locataires de Monsieur Blondeau</span>), adapted by G. R. Sims. It was this theatre with which his name was principally associated, and where he played comedy roles in the revivals of F. C. Burnand's <span class="italic">Betsy</span>, James Albery's <span class="italic">Pink Dominos</span>, and Taylor's <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span>. Some of his most successful original characters at this theatre arose out of his skilful delineation of old men, from Talbot in Gilbert's <span class="italic">Foggerty's Fairy</span> (1881) to the hen-pecked old General Bletchingley in Burnand's <span class="italic">Headless Man</span> (1890). At Daly's Theatre in 1895 he appeared as Smoggins in <span class="italic">An Artist's Model</span> and Duckworth Crabbe in <span class="italic">The Chili Widow</span>. His last appearance in London was on 17 July 1897 at the Criterion, as Thomas Tyndal in Walter Stokes Craven's <span class="italic">Four Little Girls</span>.<br>
<br>Besides being what was known as a &#145;mugger&#146;, or maker of comic faces, Blakeley was a genuine comedian, and was particularly successful as Hardcastle in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. In showing self-importance, in airs of assumed dignity, and in the revelation of scandalized propriety, he stood alone. Blakeley, who had been married, died at Criterion House, Clovelly Terrace, Walham Green, London, on 8 December 1897, and was buried in Fulham cemetery on 13 December.<br>
