<span class="headword">Potter,  Francis</span>  (1594&#150;1678), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman, instrument maker, and experimentalist</span>, was the second son of the Revd Richard Potter (<i>d</i>. 1628), prebendary of Worcester, and his wife, who belonged to the Horsey family of Clifton, Dorset. He was born at Mere vicarage, Wiltshire, on 29 May (Trinity Sunday) 1594, and educated at the King's School, Worcester. In 1609, he went up as a commoner to Trinity College, Oxford, where his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22611/', "Hannibal Potter (1592&#150;1664)")</script>, was a scholar; Francis graduated BA in 1613 and MA in 1616. In 1625 he proceeded BD. He succeeded his father as rector of Kilmington, which was then in Somerset, though there is some confusion regarding the exact date. Archives in Trinity College, Oxford, give Richard Potter's death as 1628  (&#145;Blakiston's register&#146;, ref. 73), though a list of rectors in Kilmington church, compiled in the early twentieth century, with no sources cited, gives Francis Potter's induction date into the parish as 4 November 1626. Wood  (2.612), however, gives the date as 1637, which is almost certainly incorrect. But it is known that Potter did not make his home at Kilmington for some time after becoming rector. He continued to reside in Trinity College, and to pay his annual 40 shillings &#145;caution money&#146; until 1631.<br>
<br>Potter escaped sequestration during the civil war and interregnum. He had been sickly, especially when younger, but his health improved with age, though he subsequently became blind. He did not marry. His friend John Aubrey provides in <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span> the most detailed and intimate portrait of Potter, whom he greatly admired. Aubrey describes him as &#145;like a monk&#146;, and as &#145;pretty long visagd, and pale cleare skin, gray eie&#146;. In old age, Potter preferred to be looked after by his servants who &#145;were kind to him&#146; rather than by his kinsfolk who &#145;did begrudge what he spent&#146;.<br>
<br>Potter was a practical mechanician and inventor, and admired Dr John Wilkins. He made quadrants, and invented a beam compass which could divide an inch into a thousand parts. The compass was later given to Aubrey. He experimented with blood transfusion in the 1640s, and Aubrey sent him a surgical lancet for this work. Potter hoped to use transfusion to cure diseases, and later communicated his results to the Royal Society via John Aubrey. He was proposed for fellowship of the Royal Society on 18 March 1663, and admitted on 11 November of that year. He probably made the fine dial (probably seen in Loggan's view in <span class="italic">Oxonia illustrata</span>) on the north side of the original quadrangle of Trinity College, Oxford. He also drew and painted; the copy of the founder's portrait in Trinity College hall is his work, and Aubrey said that he devised an instrument for drawing in perspective, which was afterwards reinvented by Wren. He was fond of chess, which he played with a contemporary at Trinity, Colonel Bishop, who was accounted by Aubrey &#145;the best in England&#146;. Potter also cultivated and experimented with bees; he and Aubrey examined them under the microscope.<br>
<br>Potter was interested in computing the number of the beast, connecting 25, the &#145;appropinque&#146; square root of 666, with various institutions in the Roman Catholic church. His ideas were elaborated in a manuscript which was read in 1637 by Joseph Mede, and commended as a wonderful discovery, the &#145;happiest that ever yet came into the world&#146;, and as calculated to &#145;make some of your German speculatives half wild&#146;  (Mede to S. Hartlib, 29 Jan 1638, Mede, 1077). It was published as <span class="italic">An Interpretation of the Number 666</span>, by Leonard Lichfield of Oxford in 1642, with a symbolical frontispiece, an opinion by Mede prefixed, and a preface date from Kilmington. Wood  (2.612) wrote that it was translated into French, Dutch, and Latin, printed in a small octavo at Amsterdam in 1677, and attributed to Thomas Gilbert (1613&#150;1694) of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Potter's work on the number of the beast was read in November 1666 by Pepys, who considered it to be &#145;mighty ingenious&#146;. It continued to be influential and was reprinted in Worcester as late as 1808.<br>
<br>Potter lived through fast-moving political and intellectual times, and his interests in science, medicine, and biblical eschatology spanned some of the deepest concerns of the age. He died in April 1678, and was buried in the same month in the chancel of Kilmington church.<br>
