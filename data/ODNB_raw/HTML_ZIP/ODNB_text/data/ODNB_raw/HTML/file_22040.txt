<span class="headword">Petit,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1213), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland</span>, was a follower of Hugh de Lacy, first lord of Meath (<i>d</i>. 1186), and probably went over to Ireland with him in 1171. Between 1184 and 1186 Lacy granted him the barony of Magheradernon in Westmeath and Mullingar became the chief Petit manor. Lacy also granted him land in the barony of Shrule in Longford and Rathkenny and possibly Dunboyne in Meath. Petit's subsequent grants of land in Westmeath and Meath to the houses of St Mary, Dublin, and Llanthony in Gloucester were made for Lacy's soul. Between 1206 and 1210 Petit was also granted Dromin and part of Dromiskin in Louth by the archbishop of Armagh.<br>
<br>In 1185 Petit defeated an Irish force raiding Meath and killed its leader M&aacute;el Sechlainn Mac Lochlainn, king of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain. He served as justiciar of Ireland in the early 1190s. On 26 March 1204 he was appointed, with three others, to hear the complaint of Meiler fitz Henry, justiciar of Ireland, against William de Burgh. On 20 March 1208 he was sent by John with messages to the justiciar of Ireland. On 28 June 1210 Petit appeared at Dublin, with others, as a messenger from Walter de Lacy, second lord of Meath, praying the king to relax his ire and suffer Walter to approach his presence. This plea was unsuccessful and Meath was taken into the king's hands. Before 1210 Petit had served as constable of Meath for Lacy and subsequently served as steward of Meath on the king's behalf. In 1211 he was again justiciar and, along with Simon de Rochefort, bishop of Meath, Master Gerard de Cusack, and his own brother Ralph Petit, archdeacon of Meath and from 1227 to 1230 bishop of Meath, he served as an arbitrator in the matter of the division of their Irish lands between the two houses of Llanthony. In 1212 he and other Irish barons supported John against Innocent III.<br>
<br>Petit died in 1213. His son was taken by King John as a hostage for Richard de Faipo. His widow in February 1215 offered 100 marks for liberty to remarry as she pleased, and for the replacement of her son as hostage by Faipo's own son. Many members of his family came with Petit to Ireland, including his brothers Ralph and Nicholas and his nephew Henry.<br>
