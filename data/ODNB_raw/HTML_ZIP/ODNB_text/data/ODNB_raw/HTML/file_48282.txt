<span class="headword">Cogidubnus</span> <span class="st"> [Cogidumnus, Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, Togidubnus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 47&#150;70), <span class="occ">king in Britain</span>, is mentioned only once in Roman literature, in the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> of Tacitus, when he is reported to have been assigned certain tribes and to have remained loyal to Rome down to the memory of the historian. The date at which the king was given these responsibilities in the newly emergent province of Britain is not closely defined, but it probably fell within the governorship of Ostorius Scapula (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 47&#150;52). The location of Cogidubnus's kingdom is also uncertain, but a vital clue was provided by an inscription found at Chichester (Noviomagus) in 1723. This is a dedication for a temple to the gods Neptune and Minerva, set up on the authority of Cogidubnus. Noviomagus was thus a major centre in his realm, though not necessarily the only one. The area to the north was occupied by the tribe of the Atrebates, the heart of the kingdom of Verica who fled to the Roman empire early in the reign of Claudius (<i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 41&#150;2). It is a plausible suggestion that Verica's kingdom was handed over to the pro-Roman Cogidubnus after the Roman conquest, along with the territories of other neighbouring peoples. The (translated) title of Cogidubnus on the Chichester inscription accords well with his honoured status: &#145;great king in Britain&#146;. The text also indicates that the king had been invested with full Roman citizenship by Claudius and had taken the emperor's praenomen and nomen, Tiberius Claudius. The precise legal position of Cogidubnus has been much discussed. The only evidence is contained in the wording of the Chichester stone, the text of which is incomplete. The king's status was earlier interpreted as <i>rex et legatus Augusti in</i> <i>Britannia</i> (&#145;king and imperial legate in Britain&#146;). Such a combination of roles is without parallel and long seemed anomalous. A revised reading of the text gives the title <i>rex magnus in</i> <i>Britannia</i> (&#145;great king in Britain&#146;) and this is to be preferred.<br>
<br>The origins of Cogidubnus are unknown. His name is not certainly established: the first two letters of his cognomen on the Chichester inscription are lost, and Togidubnus appears to have as strong a claim as any other. Tacitus called him Cogidumnus. He may have been a prince of the Atrebatic house who fled to the Roman world before the invasion of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43 and been subsequently given enhanced powers in the early years of occupation. Equally, he may never have left the island, but provided useful services to the occupying power, including bases for westward campaigns. The length of his reign is also undefined. Tacitus's comment that he continued his loyalty to Rome &#145;down to our memory&#146; should mean that he remained in power until the 70s, Tacitus having been born <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 56. This would allow Cogidubnus a reign of twenty to twenty-five years. But this raises a problem. The employment of allied native rulers was favoured by Claudius but phased out by his successor Nero. The survival of a British king from the reign of Claudius to that of Vespasian would be an extreme exception, though not wholly beyond possibility.<br>
<br>The archaeological setting of the realm of Cogidubnus provides some evidence for the influence of the king on the early Romanization of southern Britain. Aside from the temple of Neptune and Minerva mentioned on the Chichester stone, Chichester has produced the base of a statue to Nero, an unusually early monument for the British province. The town of Calleva (Silchester) among the Atrebates also reveals early urban development along Roman lines, with an early forum and amphitheatre. Most impressive of all is the luxurious residence erected at Fishbourne, about a mile west of Chichester. The first phase of this palatial dwelling dates to the reign of Nero, <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 55&#150;60. The building was never completed and its demolished remains were later covered by an immense palace arranged around a series of courtyards and light-wells, the whole complex covering some 6 acres. This went up about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 75. Although the Neronian residence could have been planned for Cogidubnus, the later palace seems rather too late for him. It might have been built for his unknown successor, grown rich on the revenues and tolls amassed by the native kingdom.<br>
<br>Native rulers contributed much to the growth and stability of the Roman provinces. Relatively few such kings are attested in the western provinces. Although little is known about him for certain, Cogidubnus was one of the more successful and effective kings in Roman service. The rapid Roman conquest and occupation of southern Britain owed a great deal to his steadfast loyalty.<br>
