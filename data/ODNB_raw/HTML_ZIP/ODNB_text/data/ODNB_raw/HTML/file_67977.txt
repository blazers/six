<span class="headword">Webster,  Maurice</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">lutenist and composer</span>, was probably the son of George Webster, lutenist at the B&uuml;ckeburg court near Hanover, perhaps taking his unusual first name from Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Cassel. A George Webster was among Robert Browne's company of English actors and musicians at Kassel between at least 1596 and 1603. Maurice in turn worked at the Holstein-Schaumburg court of Count Ernst III in B&uuml;ckeburg until the count's death in 1622. He contributed four dances to Thomas Simpson's <span class="italic">Taffel Consort</span> (published in Hamburg in 1621; most of the composers featured in the collection were working at B&uuml;ckeburg).<br>
<br>Following Count Ernst's death Webster travelled to England and was appointed as &#145;musician for the Consort&#146; to James I, serving among the lutes from 25 March 1623. He was allowed regular supplies of strings for the bass lute, but may also have played the bass viol since all his extant compositions are for string consort; two bass viol &#145;divisions on a ground&#146; also survive. His importance as a composer was in apparently introducing to England a consort style already prevalent in Germany, in which the two upper parts engage in dialogue through short phrases, freely exchanging places within the texture. The inner parts were simplified or even omitted as the textures were reduced to three or four parts only. Five sets of music and papers belonging to the composer were listed on 9 November 1636 among &#145;Severall &hellip; Setts of bookes&#146; in the possession of William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle (1593&#150;1676), suggesting he had been employed by the duke. He was a member of the Corporation of Musick of Westminster, reconstituted by charter of 15 July 1635, but Maurice Webster, described as gentleman, was buried at St Peter's, Nottingham, on 22 December that year, presumably while in service with Cavendish.<br>
