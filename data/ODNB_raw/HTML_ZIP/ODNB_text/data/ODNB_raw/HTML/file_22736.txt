<span class="headword">Prestwich, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1812&#150;1896), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 12 March 1812 at Pensbury, Clapham, the eldest surviving son of Joseph Prestwich, a wine merchant descended from a long line of Lancashire landowners, and his wife, Catherine (<i>bap</i>. 1785, <i>d</i>. 1850), daughter of Edward Blakeway, one-time porcelain manufacturer at Coalport in Shropshire. The Prestwich family lived in Clapham and later South Lambeth when Joseph was a child, and he attended schools in Wandsworth, Forest Hill, and South Lambeth. In 1823 he was sent to Paris, presumably because of his father's connections with the wine trade in France. He remained at school in Montmartre for two years, becoming fluent in French. On his return to England he went to a school in South Norwood, and then to Richard Valpy's school in Reading, from where he went up to University College, London, in 1828, to study chemistry and natural philosophy. Prestwich became very keen on science, setting up a laboratory at home in Lambeth, and starting a collection of rocks and minerals. He studied oil painting and lithography and became familiar with the British Museum in London. In 1830, at the age of eighteen, he joined the family business in Mark Lane in the City of London.<br>
<br>Geological research was now conducted in Prestwich's spare time; his first independent fieldwork was carried out during holidays with his grandparents at Broseley in the Coalbrookdale coalfield. There he mapped the surface rocks, worked underground in the pits, and collected fossils for later identification. He read accounts of his work to the Geological Society of London in 1834 and 1836, and his paper on the geology of Coalbrookdale was eventually published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society</span> in 1840. Prestwich made extended visits to Scotland in 1834 and 1835, comparing his Coalbrookdale rocks with their Scottish equivalents, and he read papers on fossil fish from Gamrie and on the elevation of the Banffshire coast to the Geological Society of London which, once again, were published in 1840.<br>
<br>Although Prestwich worked a full week in the wine trade, frequently travelling as the firm's representative, geology became a passion bordering on obsession. Solitary and withdrawn as a young man, he drove himself hard, filling long days with business, study, and self-improvement, while walking great distances on an empty stomach to save money. His health suffered, and throughout his long life Prestwich suffered from stress-related illnesses. It did not help that, in 1842, his business responsibilities were increased when he took control of the family firm, which had been run into difficulties by his father.<br>
<br>In 1840 Prestwich began the systematic study of the Lower Tertiary strata, on which his reputation as a geologist chiefly rests. By meticulous mapping and collecting throughout the Tertiary outcrops of the Thames valley and Hampshire, Prestwich demonstrated that marine sands to the east of London, which he called the Thanet Sands, were the oldest of all the British Tertiaries; that the overlying marine Woolwich Beds were the same age as the terrestrial Reading Beds to the west; and that the London Clay was the same age as the Bognor Beds of Hampshire and therefore older than the Barton and Bracklesham Beds. These results, published in three substantial papers in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span> between 1850 and 1854, laid the foundations for all later studies of the British Tertiary succession. He followed them up in 1855 and 1857 with papers on the correlation of the British succession with strata in France and Belgium. Prestwich was awarded the Geological Society's Wollaston medal in 1849 for his Coalbrookdale and Tertiary researches.<br>
<br>It was about this date that Prestwich first turned his attention to water supply, a subject on which he became recognized as an expert. He published <span class="italic">A Geological Inquiry Respecting the Water-Bearing Strata of the Country around London</span> in 1851, and served on a royal commission on water supply in 1864. Much later, in the 1880s, Prestwich was instrumental in improving Oxford's water supply. Other practical matters that took his attention, and on which he published, were geological aspects of the proposed channel tunnel (1874) and the prospects for finding coal beneath south-east England (1871, 1872).<br>
<br>At the same time as his Tertiary work Prestwich was also studying the more recent Crag deposits of East Anglia. Between 1845 and 1850 he paid many visits to this area, noting sections and collecting specimens. He published one short paper in 1849, but pressure of other work delayed completion until 1868, when he read three papers to the Geological Society of London. By the time they were published in its <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal</span> in 1871, much of their novelty had been lost.<br>
<br>Prestwich was a regular visitor to France throughout his life, combining business with geology whenever possible. His papers on the geology of Epernay and Rilly, in the heart of the Champagne region, underline the connection between these two parts of his life. Prestwich became a member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;ologique de France in 1838, and retained close links with French geologists until his death.<br>
<br>In 1858 Prestwich became a member of the committee set up by the Geological Society to oversee the excavation of Brixham cave in south Devon, an untouched site which it was hoped might reveal new information on Pleistocene stratigraphy and on the antiquity of the human race. Although worked flints were found associated with the bones of extinct animals in the cave, Prestwich was not convinced until he and John Evans visited Boucher de Perthes in Abbeville, northern France, where he saw flint implements in bone-bearing gravels, and realized that humans had indeed coexisted with elephants and other Pleistocene mammals. These conclusions, which were accepted by Lyell and others, were published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> in 1861. Prestwich was awarded the royal medal of the Royal Society in 1865 in recognition of the importance of this work. Hugh Falconer, who had been Prestwich's companion throughout the Brixham and Abbeville work, died in 1856, and the task of writing up a report on the Brixham cave excavation devolved to Prestwich. He eventually completed it in 1872, and it was published by the Royal Society in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1873.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1870 Prestwich married Grace Anne McCall (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Milne) (<i>d</i>. 1899), the niece of his friend and co-worker Hugh Falconer. In the same year, he was elected president of the Geological Society of London, of which he had already served as secretary and treasurer. Two years later in 1872, at the age of sixty, he retired from his business life to devote himself to science. He and his sister Isabella Civil Prestwich had built a house high on the downs above the village of Shoreham in Kent in 1865, and this, Darent Hulme, now became his home. He took time to organize the great collection of geological specimens he had amassed, and started to write up papers based on the innumerable field excursions of the previous thirty-five years. Not that he ceased or slowed down the pace of his work: he travelled in France in 1872 and again in 1873, in Dorset in 1873, and through the north of England in 1874. Few geologists of his day had seen more rock in the field than Joseph Prestwich.<br>
<br>In 1874 Prestwich was offered and, after some hesitation, accepted, the chair of geology at Oxford, vacant after the death of John Phillips. He held the chair until 1888, working in the museum, leading field excursions, and giving regular courses of lectures. He maintained the pace of his own researches, publishing papers on an astonishing range of subjects including the parallel roads of Glenroy, raised beaches, the causes of volcanic action, regional metamorphism, and on an iguanodon from the Kimmeridge Clay near Oxford. Towards the end of his time in Oxford Prestwich laboured to produce a textbook, and <span class="italic">Geology, Chemical, Physical and Stratigraphical</span> was published by the Clarendon Press in two volumes in 1886 and 1888. This book was planned as an antidote to the rigidly uniformitarian views which were the legacy of successive editions of Charles Lyell's <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span>, and which Prestwich believed were harming the subject. He was prepared to believe that the scale and rate of many geological phenomena had been different in the past from what they are today, and therefore that the earth was not as ancient as postulated by those who insisted on total uniformity. Indeed, towards the end of his life Prestwich found himself backing a number of unfashionable causes. Chief among these was his support for eoliths, supposed human artefacts which had been found by Benjamin Harrison and others in the ancient gravels which cap many plateaus in southern England, and which seemed to take the human race back to the early, or even preglacial period. Papers on this and other topics were published in one of Prestwich's last books, <span class="italic">Collected Papers on some Controverted Questions in Geology</span> (1895).<br>
<br>Prestwich remained active well into old age. He was president of the International Geological Congress held in London in 1888, regularly visited plateau gravel sites and raised beaches in 1890 and 1891, and wrote a long paper on the great submergence of the land which he detected at the close of the Glacial period, which was published by the Royal Society. However as each year went by he became less and less active, until his health failed in November 1895. He was knighted in the new year's honours list, but never recovered sufficiently to enjoy the honour. Sir Joseph Prestwich died at Darent Hulme on 23 June 1896, aged eighty-four and was buried a few days later at Shoreham. In his will he left money to the Geological Society of London to endow a medal to be awarded for researches into stratigraphical and physical geology.<br>
