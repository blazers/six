<span class="headword">Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1170), <span class="occ">prince of Gwynedd and poet</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20979/', "Owain Gwynedd (d. 1170), king of north Wales")</script>; his mother, Pyfog (or Ffynod), was Irish. After the reconquest of Ceredigion in 1136 by Owain and his brother Cadwaladr, Hywel held lands there and in 1143, following the murder of his cousin Anarawd ap Gruffudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth by Cadwaladr's men, he drove Cadwaladr out of northern Ceredigion. Two years later he and his brother Cynan raided Cardigan and in 1146, with Anarawd's brother Cadell, he captured Carmarthen. Hywel joined Cadell, his brothers Maredudd and Rhys, and William fitz Gerald in 1147 in a successful attack on the castle of Wiston and later the same year Hywel and Cynan combined in an attack on Cadwaladr in Meirionnydd and took his castle of Cynfal near Tywyn. In 1150 Hywel captured and imprisoned Cadwaladr's son Cadfan and seized his lands. By 1153 he had been expelled from Ceredigion by Cadell, Maredudd, and Rhys. In 1159 he and Cynan took part in an inconclusive campaign led by the earl of Cornwall, against Rhys ap Gruffudd, which ended in a truce.<br>
<br>Hywel was probably Owain Gwynedd's designated heir. Owain died in October 1170, but Hywel's succession was challenged by his two youngest half-brothers, <a href="#cosubject_7322">Dafydd [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_23457">Rhodri [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the sons of Owain's second wife, Cristin. He was defeated and killed by them near Pentraeth in Anglesey in 1170. Five of his six foster brothers, the sons of Cydifor Wyddel (the Irishman) were killed with him, and their elegy and that of Hywel were sung by the only survivor, Peryf ap Cydifor. He was buried at Bangor. The name of his wife is unknown but he had at least one son, Gruffudd.<br>
<br>The poet Cynddelw praised him as a soldier, as did Llywarch ap Llywelyn (Prydydd y Moch) in a poem to Dafydd. Hywel himself was also a distinguished poet and eight of his poems survive. As a member of a royal house he was not constrained by the conventions of court poetry and he composed some of the earliest surviving Welsh love and nature poems.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_7322"></a><span class="headword">Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1203), <span class="occ">king of Gwynedd</span>, was Hywel's half-brother and the elder of the two sons of Owain Gwynedd and his cousin Cristin. In 1157 Dafydd and his brother Cynan ambushed Henry II in the forest near Hawarden during the king's invasion of north Wales; by 1165 he appears to have been holding Dyffryn Clwyd when he raided and plundered the adjacent cantref of Tegeingl. In 1170 he seized power in Gwynedd after killing Hywel at Pentraeth.<br>
<br>The next few years saw him consolidating his power. Although he had the kingship, the territory had been divided between the surviving brothers but he gradually brought all Gwynedd under his rule. When Henry II's sons went to war against him in 1173&#150;4 Dafydd gave Henry his unswerving support and it may have been this loyalty that led to his marriage to the king's illegitimate half-sister Emma of Anjou in 1174. This was a significant dynastic alliance; it was the first time that a member of a Welsh ruling house had married outside Wales.<br>
<br>Dafydd had imprisoned his brother Rhodri, who had sought a share of the inheritance, but towards the end of 1175 Rhodri escaped and drove Dafydd out of Gwynedd west of the Conwy. After this a certain equilibrium seems to have been achieved; Dafydd held Gwynedd east of the Conwy, Rhodri the west, and Gruffudd and Maredudd, the two sons of Cynan, who had died in 1174, Meirionnydd and Ll&#375;n and the lands in between. Dafydd, however, retained the kingship; in a grant of the tithes of Nefyn in Ll&#375;n to Haughmond Abbey some time between 1177 and 1190 he is described as &#145;Rex Norwallie&#146; (&#145;king of north Wales&#146;) and in other grants he used the titles &#145;David Rex filius Owini&#146; (&#145;David the King, son of Owain&#146;) and &#145;Princeps Norwallie&#146; (&#145;prince of north Wales&#146;).<br>
<br>In May 1177 most of the Welsh rulers attended the Council of Oxford, but only Dafydd and Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth did homage to Henry II. This may suggest a polarization of native political authority in Wales with Dafydd and Rhys being recognized as the dominant rulers in the north and south. Henry granted him and Emma the lordship of Ellesmere in Shropshire and the manor of Hales in Worcestershire. In June 1177, according to the Chester annalist, Dafydd aided the earl of Chester in his occupation of Bromfield or Maelor, part of northern Powys.<br>
<br>During their journey through Wales in 1188 Gerald of Wales and Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury were entertained by Dafydd at his castle at Rhuddlan, and Gerald commented on the way in which his host succeeded in maintaining a neutral position between the Welsh and the English. He also stated that at the time of the visit Dafydd's nephew, the young Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, had already begun to challenge his uncles.<br>
<br>According to <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> Llywelyn, Rhodri, and the sons of Cynan allied against Dafydd in 1194, defeated him near Aberconwy, and ejected him from north Wales, leaving him only three castles. He was imprisoned by Llywelyn in 1197 and in 1203 he was driven out of Gwynedd and retired to his lands in England where he died in the same year. He had one son, <a name="cosubject_53020"></a><span class="headword">Owain</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1212)<span class="occ"></span>, from whom the manor of Hales came to be called Halesowen. He appears to have been a competent ruler and a good soldier, but the circumstances of his accession to power probably meant that his position could never be unchallenged and he was eventually overthrown by one of the greatest of all Welsh rulers, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_23457"></a><span class="headword">Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1195), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the younger son of Owain and Cristin. In 1175 he was imprisoned by Dafydd but escaped and expelled his brother from Gwynedd west of the Conwy; he was ruling there in 1188 when he met the archbishop of Canterbury and his party in Anglesey, but, according to Gerald, none of his <i>teulu</i> or retinue was willing to take the cross. He appears to have been ejected from Anglesey, possibly by the sons of Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd, about 1190; in 1193 he returned with Manx aid in a campaign described as <i>haf y Gwyddyl</i> (&#145;the summer of the Gaels&#146;), but before the end of the year he was again driven out. <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> states that he took part in the campaign of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and the sons of Cynan against Dafydd in 1194 but this is not certain; in the same year Llywelyn won victories at Porthaethwy and Coedana in Anglesey, presumably over him. He died in 1195 and was buried at Holyhead. His wife was a daughter of Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth; he was subsequently betrothed to a daughter of the Manx king Ragnvald I but the marriage does not seem to have taken place and Llywelyn ab Iorwerth was later to seek a papal dispensation to marry her. He had three sons; some of his descendants were in the service of the thirteenth-century princes of Gwynedd and his great-granddaughter Senena was the mother of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.<br>
<br>There is a substantial body of poetry addressed to Dafydd and Rhodri. Prydydd y Moch addressed three poems to the former and four to the latter, Gwalchmai one to each of them, and Gwilym Rhyfel two to Dafydd; Elidir Sais sang Rhodri's elegy.<br>
