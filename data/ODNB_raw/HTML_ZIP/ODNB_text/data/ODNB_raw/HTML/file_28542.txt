<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wallace,  Robert</span>  (1831&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and politician</span>, second son of Jasper Wallace, master gardener, was born at Kincaple near Cupar, Fife, on 24 June 1831. His mother claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of a peer, according to Wallace's autobiography. In his home he was taught a strict Calvinism. He was educated at the Geddes Institution, Culross; the high school, Edinburgh; and at the University of St Andrews, where he won special distinction and graduated MA in 1853. After teaching for some time in private families, and attending the 1853&#150;4 session at the Divinity Hall, Edinburgh, he was appointed on 22 April 1854 classical master at the Madras Academy in Cupar. In October 1855 he resumed his theological studies at Edinburgh University. He was licensed to preach in 1857, and shortly afterwards appointed to the charge of Newton-on-Ayr. In 1858 he married Margaret, daughter of James Robertson of Cupar; they had four sons and a daughter. In 1860 he moved to Trinity College Church, Edinburgh. In 1866 he was appointed examiner in philosophy in the University of St Andrews, and two years later the Edinburgh corporation presented him with the charge of Old Greyfriars. In 1869 the University of Glasgow conferred upon him the degree of DD.<br>
<br>As a churchman Wallace was noted for the support he gave both in the Edinburgh presbytery and in the general assembly of the Church of Scotland to broad views on theology and to the reform of worship, of which Dr Robert Lee, his predecessor at Greyfriars, was the chief champion. To the latter controversy he contributed <span class="italic">Reform of the Church of Scotland in Worship, Government, and Doctrine</span>, and to the former an essay entitled &#145;Church tendencies in Scotland&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Recess Studies</span> (1870), which led to much controversy and ultimately to his impeachment for heresy. In 1872 he was appointed by the crown to the chair of church history in Edinburgh University, and his ecclesiastical and political opponents protested. His inaugural lecture, published as <span class="italic">The Study of Ecclesiastic History</span> (1873), declared not the truth of theology but &#145;the truth of its history&#146; and led to his prosecution. Wallace won his case mainly owing to his own remarkable powers as a debater, but in 1876 he determined to leave the church&#151;resigning his chair, charge, and orders&#151;and became editor of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> newspaper. For some years previously he had been contributing to that newspaper, but his editorship was not a success, and he resigned in 1880.<br>
<br>In 1881 Wallace entered the Middle Temple, and in 1883 was called to the bar. In 1886 he was elected to parliament as a radical to represent East Edinburgh, which he held until his death. In parliament he maintained an unusual independence, and though he took only an occasional part in the debates, he kept up the reputation he had won in the ecclesiastical courts. While about to address the House of Commons on 5 June 1899 he fell down in a fit, and died in Westminster Hospital on the following day. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife predeceased him. At the time of his death he was engaged on a biography of George Buchanan, completed by J. C. Smith and published in 1899, and on his autobiography, published in 1903 in a memorial volume prepared by J. C. Smith and W. Wallace. Wallace was in later life irascible and unsettled: his loss of vocation increased rather than diminished his intellectual difficulties. The element of bitterness was reflected by his always placing the word &#145;minister&#146; in inverted commas  (Drummond and Bulloch, 260).<br>
