<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Laurence</span>, third Lord Oliphant  (<em>d.</em> 1566), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the son of Colin, master of Oliphant, and Lady Elizabeth Keith, second daughter of the third Earl Marischal. Colin was killed at Flodden in 1513, and so it was as a minor that Laurence succeeded his grandfather, John, second Lord Oliphant, some time before 18 November 1516. He married Margaret, eldest daughter of Sir James Sandilands of Calder and widow of Robert Bruce of Auchenbowie, before 10 July 1525, and had come of age by 30 March 1526. He and Margaret had three sons and four daughters; the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20709/', "Laurence Oliphant")</script>, was born in 1529.<br>
<br>The core of Oliphant's estates lay in Perthshire, with extensive lands in Aberdalgie, Dupplin, and their environs. In 1533 his right to hold the three-quarter lands of Pitcaithly, south of Perth, by feu-ferme from the crown, was challenged by the king's lawyers, and it was not until 1538 that he and his wife were jointly infeft in this property. He also added substantially to his properties by acquiring lands in Caithness from a cousin. Closer to home, he owned property on the east side of the watergate in Perth. There is no record of his having been entered as a burgess there, nor do the burgh records indicate that he took any part in the affairs of the town. Indeed, he remained so aloof from them that he did not accompany the large contingent from Perth and its environs which went to the aid of the earl of Lennox in 1544.<br>
<br>In 1542 Oliphant had, however, accompanied the Scottish army to Solway Moss, and was there captured by the English. He found the subsequent march to London arduous and was still awaiting a pledge to relieve him from captivity on 19 January 1543. In the meantime, he signed Cassillis's pledge to support King Henry's aims in Scotland and had received a gift of money from the English monarch. Oliphant was back in Edinburgh by early June 1543 and sitting with the council, but in the following March his ransom (set at 800 merks) was still unpaid and his son, acting as his pledge for payment, remained in England. None the less, Oliphant ignored his &#145;assurance&#146; and did nothing significant to forward King Henry's designs in Scotland.<br>
<br>Oliphant was engaged in a legal dispute early in 1544 but refused to appear in Perth sheriff court and had the case removed to Edinburgh and the lords of council. A contract for the marriage of his daughter Jean to William Moncrieff of that ilk was arranged in May 1550, but at the height of the Reformation crisis, ten years later, the two lairds were engaged in a quarrel which precluded Oliphant's attendance on the affairs of the lords of the congregation. His absence was a cause of annoyance to his peers, but the English ambassador Thomas Randolph noted that Oliphant's influence was of little significance, and that in any case he was most likely to follow the dictates of the earl of Huntly. Oliphant did not sit in the Reformation Parliament in August 1560, and probably opposed the religious reformation. He died at Old Wick on 29 March 1566. His son was served heir to his father on 2 May 1566, and well before that date had become a prominent member of Queen Mary's party.<br>
