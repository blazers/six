<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Denham,  Dixon</span>  (1786&#150;1828), <span class="occ">explorer in Africa</span>, born in London on 1 January 1786, was the son of James Denham and his wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Symonds. He was educated from 1793 at Merchant Taylors' School. After being briefly articled to a London solicitor, he joined the army as a volunteer in 1811 and served in the Peninsula, where he was promoted lieutenant, and in Belgium. In Lisbon he married Harriet Hawkins, a widow, a marriage he solemnized in London on 20 February 1815 but never again seems to have referred to publicly. He was placed on half pay in 1818 and appointed an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he ingratiated himself with the authorities.<br>
<br>The course of the Niger was still untraced. Attempts to trace it from west Africa, begun originally by Mungo Park, had ended in disaster, and it was proposed instead to approach it from Tripoli, where the British consul-general, Hanmer Warrington, had established friendly relations with the ruling Turkish pasha, Yusuf Karamanl&#305;. In 1818 Joseph Ritchie set out but died after a few months. To replace him, the Colonial Office recruited a Scottish doctor, Walter Oudney, and his Edinburgh neighbour Hugh Clapperton, a half-pay naval officer. Denham then wrote to the Colonial Office proposing his own services. He seems to have had influential supporters, for he was not only accepted but given command of the expedition. This was to prove disastrous. Pushy, self-important, and malicious, Denham treated his colleagues with a scarcely veiled contempt that from the start soured relations between them.<br>
<br>In April 1822 they left Tripoli for Murzuq, the capital of the Fezzan. The success of their journey depended on the pasha's support. At Murzuq they found that no further arrangements had been made, so Denham returned to Tripoli and, after fruitless arguments with the pasha, set off impulsively for London. At Marseilles, however, he heard that the necessary military escort would be provided and rejoined his colleagues; in November 1822 they set out southwards.<br>
<br>They travelled across the desert along the long-established Sahara trade route to the kingdom of Bornu (later Nigeria), a route littered with the skeletons of thousands of slaves abandoned there over the centuries. At the pasha's suggestion they wore European clothes (consular uniforms), since they were in no danger under his protection. In February, having sighted Lake Chad, they reached Kuka (later Kukawa), the capital of Bornu, where to their amazement they were welcomed by a spectacular array of some five thousand horsemen, many of them wearing chain-mail armour, sent by Sheikh Muhammad el Kanemi, the Muslim prophet who ruled Bornu in the king's name. Though delighted to meet them, he refused to let them leave Bornu, lest they meet some misadventure for which he would be blamed. Unwillingly he let Denham accompany a campaign against some neighbouring Fulani. The Bornu forces were routed, Denham was wounded and nearly captured. During the rains Denham and his companions stayed in Kuka, Denham secretly sending home malicious reports about Clapperton's sexual behaviour (which he was later to admit he had never believed). They then separated. Oudney and Clapperton made for Kano, but Oudney died on the way. Denham investigated Lake Chad, but was prevented by warfare from reaching its eastern shore. Once Clapperton was back from Kano they returned to Tripoli, suffering a terrible desert crossing. They reached England in June 1825, having failed to find the Niger, but having opened much of north central Africa to European knowledge.<br>
<br>Unlike his companions, Denham retained his health throughout the expedition. Clapperton, despite his broken condition, immediately embarked again on the Niger quest, where he died. Denham, f&ecirc;ted in London as the hero of the expedition, and elected a fellow of the Royal Society, published his <span class="italic">Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa</span> (1826), in which he suppressed as much as possible all mention of his companions, and took the credit for some of their discoveries. Written in a lively style, and embellished with engravings of his own sketches, it became one of the classics of its genre.<br>
<br>A new appointment was found for Denham in Sierra Leone, to reorganize the Liberated African department, which cared for the slaves rescued by the British naval squadron and liberated in Freetown. He arrived in January 1827 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel to find that the newly appointed governor, Sir Neil Campbell, was busy reorganizing every aspect of government, including his own department. Not until Campbell died in August was Denham able to take full charge. He travelled round the villages where the liberated people were settled, and sent detailed, well-thought-out descriptions and recommendations to the Colonial Office&#151;not in formal dispatches, but in private letters to the under-secretary, where he could safely indulge malicious comment. In January he went on a cruise for his health to Fernando Po, where he heard, and sent home, the news that his erstwhile colleague Clapperton had died.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Denham had secured for himself the post of lieutenant-governor, and was soon quarrelling with the officer commanding the troops, his senior in age and rank. But his term of office was brief. In Sierra Leone his customary good health failed. A contemporary wrote, &#145;he took to physicking himself, became soft and fleshy, and gradually sank under the fever&#146;  (Alexander, 111&#150;12), and he died in Freetown on 9 June 1828. He was buried on 15 June at the city's Circular Road cemetery.<br>
