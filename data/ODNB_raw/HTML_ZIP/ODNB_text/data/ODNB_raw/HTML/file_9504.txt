<span class="headword">Fisher,  Joseph</span>  (1655&#150;1704), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Whitrigg, Cumberland, the son of Richard Fisher. He entered Queen's College, Oxford, in 1674 aged nineteen, graduating BA in 1679 and MA in 1682. He was elected a fellow of the college in 1682, and there established a reputation for his extensive knowledge of oriental languages.<br>
<br>In 1692 Fisher was licensed by the bishop of London as lecturer in the parish of St Benet Fink in the City of London, living in a merchant's house in Broad Street to be near his work. Two years later he preached at Sevenoaks at the marriage of his friend and former pupil Thomas Lambard. This sermon, worked up into a treatise twenty-five pages long, was published in London in 1695 under the title <span class="italic">The honour of marriage, or, The institution, necessity, advantages, comforts and usefulness of a married life</span>. This work is remarkable for the breadth of its sources, biblical, rabbinic, classical, patristic, and contemporary, quoted in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and with Chaldee, Syriac, and Samaritan allusions. It might be taken as a vain parade of learning, but the author explicitly states his concern to demonstrate &#145;in this Prophane and Profligate age&#146; how widely marriage had been honoured in other ages and cultures.<br>
<br>Fisher moved from London to Westmorland in 1695 upon his appointment as vicar of Brough under Stainmore. Twelve months later, on 2 May 1696, he married there Isabell Kidd (<i>bap</i>. 1679, <i>d</i>. 1737), who at sixteen was twenty-four years his junior. They had no children. Ill health dogged Joseph Fisher's life at Brough, where William Nicolson described the vicarage as &#145;low, moist and smoaky&#146;  (Ferguson, 48).<br>
<br>On 9 July 1702 Fisher was collated as rector of Salkeld and installed as archdeacon of Carlisle in succession to Nicolson, the new bishop, but he did not move into the recently rebuilt rectory at Great Salkeld. Instead he stayed at Brough, where he remained vicar, and reports of his ill health persisted. In August 1704 he was suffering from dropsy, and on 14 or 15 November he died, aged forty-nine, &#145;pining away in grief and melancholy&#146;, according to Thomas Hearne  (Magrath, 2.45). He was buried in Brough on the fifteenth. In his short will, dated the fourteenth, he left everything to his &#145;tender and loving wife&#146;; she married his successor as vicar of Brough, Francis Thompson, with whom she had three sons. She died in 1737. Joseph Fisher's life after its bright start was sadly unfulfilled. His published sermon on marriage, seeking to counteract liberal and libertine attitudes of his day, is now his main claim to remembrance.<br>
