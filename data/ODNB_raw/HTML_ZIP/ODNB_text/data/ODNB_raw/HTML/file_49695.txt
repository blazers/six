<span class="headword">Booth,  Edwin Thomas</span>  (1833&#150;1893), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 13 November 1833 near Bel Air, Maryland, fifth of the ten children of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2887/', "Junius Brutus Booth (1796&#150;1852)")</script> and his second wife, Mary Ann Holmes (1802&#150;1885) of London, whom he married in 1851. Three brothers and two sisters survived childhood. In 1847 Edwin persuaded the manager of the Holliday Street Theatre, Baltimore, to let him appear, but nervousness spoilt his performance. The same year he began touring as his father's dresser. His official d&eacute;but was as Tressel in Cibber's version of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, at the Boston Museum Theatre on 10 September 1849. After his father's death in 1852, he performed in California, Australia, and Hawaii. In 1857 he made his first tour of the United States as a star, playing melodrama heroes and villains and Shakespearian tragic leads. Although it was considered highly promising, his work was often criticized for unevenness and threatened by his tendency to drink. Short and slight with dark eyes, long dark hair, romantic good looks, and a warm, musical voice, Booth was attractive to women. In 1860 he married Mary Devlin (1840&#150;1863), and in 1861&#150;2 they travelled to England, where Booth appeared at the Haymarket and his daughter Edwina was born.<br>
<br>In Manchester Henry Irving played secondary roles to Booth's leads and was influenced by Booth's Hamlet in conceiving his own. England reported Booth &#145;a sound and sensible actor&#146;. From earlier blood-and-thunder playing, he had begun to develop a quiet, intellectual, lyrical style favoured by cultured audiences. In 1863, devastated by his wife's death, he gave up drink. In 1864&#150;5, at the Winter Garden, New York, he played a 100-night run as Hamlet. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre, Washington, by his brother John Wilkes Booth in April 1865 led to his brief retirement. In 1869 he opened Booth's Theatre in New York as a &#145;temple to Shakespeare&#146;, where he mounted lavish productions, and the same year he married Mary McVicker (1848&#150;1881). Their son Edgar died at birth, and the marriage was strained by Mary's growing mental illness. Booth considered leasing the Lyceum Theatre, London, and alternating between it and Booth's Theatre, but lost the option. He went bankrupt in 1874 and resumed national touring. In 1880&#150;81 he revisited England, and appeared at the Princess's Theatre, London, with inadequate scenery and cast. Aspects of his technique struck English critics as old-fashioned, his gestures and facial expression as excessive, and sometimes he appeared to lack passion. But his elocution and grace were considered exemplary. Henry Irving invited him to the Lyceum, where they alternated Othello and Iago with huge success. Booth's cool, polished Iago was particularly praised (a contemporary rhyme contrasts him with Irving as &#145;the smooth Mr Booth&#146;).<br>
<br>Booth's second wife died in 1881, and in 1882&#150;3 he travelled again to Europe. He opened in London at the Adelphi, then toured cities throughout the British Isles. His Hamlet, Richelieu, Iago, Othello, and King Lear were acclaimed in England and in Germany and Austria, where he acted in English with German-speaking companies. From 1886 until retiring in 1891 he worked with Lawrence Barrett in touring management. A champion of actors' social status, he founded The Players in New York, where actors could associate with leaders in other fields. Although he was shy, and often melancholy, his huge correspondence reveals a high-spirited lover of fun, especially word play. His recording of Othello's speech to the senate is intimate, warm, personable, almost colloquial. He contributed perceptive notes to the Furness Variorum Edition of Shakespeare, wrote short memoirs of Edmund Kean and Junius Brutus Booth, and, with William Winter, published his acting versions of Shakespeare's plays. He died on 7 June 1893, after a stroke, and was buried in Mount Auburn cemetery near Boston. Well into the twentieth century he was reputed America's greatest tragedian and foremost exponent of Hamlet.<br>
