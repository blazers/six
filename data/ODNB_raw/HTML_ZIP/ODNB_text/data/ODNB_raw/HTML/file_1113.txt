<span class="headword">Baker,  Franklin</span>  (1800&#150;1867), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born in Birmingham, on 27 August 1800, the eldest son and third of ten children of Thomas Baker, headmaster of the Lancasterian School, Birmingham, and his wife, Charlotte Mould. Several of the children attained unusual distinction. In addition to Franklin Baker, they included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1109/', "Charles Baker (1803&#150;1874)")</script>, famous as an instructor of deaf people; Sir Thomas Baker (1810&#150;1886), Unitarian minister at Sidmouth in 1833&#150;4 and later a solicitor in Manchester where he was active in municipal affairs, lord mayor, and historian of the Unitarian congregation in Cross Street; Alfred Baker (1815&#150;1893), an eminent Birmingham surgeon; and Harriet (1805&#150;1850), who married Edward White Benson (1800&#150;1843) and became mother of a second Edward White Benson (1829&#150;1896), archbishop of Canterbury in 1882&#150;96.<br>
<br>Encouraged by the Revd John Kentish (1768&#150;1853), minister of New Meeting, the Unitarian congregation attended by the Bakers, Franklin Baker became a schoolmaster in Dudley. There he studied with the Revd James Hews Bransby (1783&#150;1847), entering the University of Glasgow on Dr Williams's foundation in 1820, and graduating MA in 1822.<br>
<br>Baker accepted the pulpit at Bank Street Chapel, Bolton, and was ordained on 23 September 1824. Circumstances were not auspicious. When the Revd John Holland (1766&#150;1826) had retired in 1820, one faction of the congregation carried the appointment of the Revd Noah Jones (1801&#150;1861) of Walmsley, a recent convert from Congregationalism; the other faction withdrew to establish a new congregation in Moor Lane, where the Revd George Harris (1794&#150;1859), from Renshaw Street, Liverpool, abundantly satisfied the seceders' desire for aggressive Unitarian preaching, and drew in audiences that quickly overshadowed the older congregation.<br>
<br>The growth did not survive Harris's departure for Glasgow in 1825, and in 1843 Moor Lane reunited with Bank Street, where Baker had steadily rebuilt the congregation; it was further reinforced by amalgamation with a Christian Brethren congregation, influenced by Joseph Barker (1806&#150;1875), in 1855. The next year, a new Gothic church was opened; Baker had commemorated the closing of the old chapel at the end of 1853 by four lectures which, published the next year as <span class="italic">The History of the Rise and Progress of Nonconformity in Bolton</span>, are a useful contribution to local and denominational history. An initiative in 1862 for an additional Sunday school resulted in the formation of a new congregation, Unity Church, first in Commission Street and after 1893 in Deane Road. Baker gained an impressive reputation as a preacher. He was active in charitable work, notably during the cotton famine of 1862&#150;4, and in liberal politics; but he rejected as inappropriate an invitation to become a justice of the peace.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1835 Baker had married Mary Crook (1802&#150;1879), daughter of Jeremiah Crook, a Liverpool merchant formerly of Bolton, another of whose daughters married Baker's brother Thomas; there were no children. After retiring in 1864, Baker lived for three years at Caton, near Lancaster. From about 1860 he was troubled by an enlarged prostate gland, and a fall during the removal to Caton hastened his decline. He died on 25 May 1867, from consequences of the prostate condition, at 59 Hagley Road, Edgbaston, where he had gone a few weeks earlier to be cared for by his brother; he was buried in Birmingham on 31 May.<br>
