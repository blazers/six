<span class="headword">Lowerison,  Bellerby <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1863&#150;1935), <span class="occ">socialist and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 13 July 1863 in Great Lumley, co. Durham, son of George Lowerson, a coalminer, and his wife, Dorothy Richardson. Very little is known about his early life and some basic facts are unclear. The family's name on his birth certificate is Lowerson but he always kept the &#145;i&#146; in his surname. He called himself Harry until 6 May 1910, when, in an article in the socialist newspaper <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, he adopted the forename given on his birth certificate, which was Bellerby. He left his family after disagreements with them over their strict religious views and later attended St Bede's College, Durham, where he trained as a teacher. Any record of his life has to begin in earnest in 1889, when he became a socialist as a result of meeting participants in the London dock strike.<br>
<br>Lowerison joined the east London branch of the Fabian Society and by 1891 was joint secretary of what was the biggest branch of the society in London; it met at his home in Homerton. In April 1891 he was elected to the national executive committee of the society, on which he served for a year. He was widely recognized as a very hard-working socialist propagandist  (see <span class="italic">Justice</span>, the paper of the Social Democratic Federation, 18 April 1891). He wrote numerous articles for <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, his most productive year being 1911, and he addressed socialist meetings throughout the country. On 23 July 1892 he married Alice Mabel Dutton, a Post Office clerk; they had two children, Gordon and Elaine.<br>
<br>Despite Lowerison's staunch secularism, a central component of his socialism was the idea that<blockquote>there is lot of miserable cant talked about religion necessarily making a milksop of a man, when the truth is that unless a man has a religion of some sort or other he is either a brute or a madman. (H. Lowerison, <span class="italic">Mother Earth</span>, 1902, 136)</blockquote>The co-operative commonwealth based on fellowship could not be brought about by means inimical to its ends. Though economic reform was vital, so too was change in the people's moral outlook. This change could be accomplished by bringing people into closer contact with each other, with learning, and with nature. To achieve the closer harmony of man and nature Lowerison helped to set up and organize the Clarion field clubs, the subject of his <span class="italic">Fields and Folklore</span> (1899). He envisaged the clubs as the collective stewards of the people's heritage. His essays in the collections <span class="italic">Sweet Briar Sprays</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Mother Earth</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">In England now</span> (1906) merged his political and naturalist interests; much of his later journalism blended politics and astronomy.<br>
<br>From 1894 to 1899 Lowerison taught at Wenlock Road School in the London school board division of Hackney. He was repelled by the physical surroundings for, like many schools of the time, the school was overcrowded and filthy. But most of all he loathed the character of the education that he was employed to deliver, particularly the religious elements of the curriculum. While he was a teacher he tried to improve the education of his pupils and struggled to open the eyes of his colleagues to more progressive teaching methods. It was to these ends that he helped to establish the London School Swimming Association and attempted to set up a London schools rambling club.<br>
<br>However, by the end of the 1890s Lowerison was running up against the system, and in particular against the headmaster, at Wenlock Road. In July 1898 letters he had written to <span class="italic">The Clarion</span> brought him to the attention of the school board and in November 1899 his lack of respect for the headmaster led to his dismissal without a reference. The offending letters were entitled &#145;My ideal school&#146;, in which he set out the principles on which he would found Ruskin School  (<span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, 15 July, 7 Oct, and 18 Nov 1899). He planned, first, to teach the laws of health and exercise, second, to teach, by example, habits of justice and gentleness, and, third, to discover, draw out, and develop the natural capabilities of each child.<br>
<br>After Lowerison's dismissal from Wenlock Road School his scheme was realized with funds donated by readers of <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>. Ruskin School was opened in Hunstanton, Norfolk. In February 1902 the school moved to new premises a few miles away at Heacham. Lowerison's preferred method of teaching was to link subjects such as astronomy, literature, and art and then to arouse children's interest in this unified body of knowledge. He did this by allowing them to find one aspect that excited their imaginations, and using this as a gateway to the whole. These methods were detailed in his book <span class="italic">Star Lore for Teachers</span> (1911) and exemplified in <span class="italic">From Palaeolith to Motor Car</span> (1906). Given that Lowerison, in common with most socialists of his day, viewed the ends of struggle and the means of getting there as being of necessity the same, he structured the school so that it was as deinstitutionalized as possible. He therefore allowed children considerable freedom to roam the countryside and to pursue and develop their own interests. A. S. Neill visited Ruskin School and may well have been influenced by what he saw there.<br>
<br>Ruskin School Home was busiest in 1909&#150;10, when it had fifty pupils, but it declined after the war and closed in 1926. The school's decline was matched, if not caused, by Lowerison's political drift. By 1914 his socialism had changed into a form of paternalism and with the outbreak of war he became a rampant nationalist baying for German blood  (<span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, 13 Nov 1914). When the school closed he retired to Green Garth, Houghton, near Huntingdon, where he died on 6 June 1935; he was buried later that month in Houghton on Whit Monday.<br>
