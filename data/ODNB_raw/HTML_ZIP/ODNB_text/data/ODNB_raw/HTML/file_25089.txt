<span class="headword">Sever <span class="st"> [Senhouse]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1505), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was born at Shincliffe, near Durham, but was probably a member of the Cumbrian family of Senhouse of Seascale; Sever was one of a number of contemporary variants of that family name. Ordained subdeacon on 11 March 1468 he became a monk of the Benedictine abbey of St Mary, York, and it may have been from there (so it was later claimed) that he went to study in Oxford&#151;at either Gloucester or Durham College (both were Benedictine establishments). Elected abbot of St Mary's in April 1485, he was a leading subordinate of Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, the king's lieutenant north of the Trent, who presided over a council that governed Yorkshire much as Richard III's council had done. From 1486 Sever was justice of the Forest of Galtres, and JP in each of the three Yorkshire ridings. Letters in the <span class="italic">Plumpton Correspondence</span> show him receiving bills of complaint, examining witnesses, and advising arbitration, while in 1493 he and Sir Richard Cholmley settled a dispute between the weavers and cordwainers of York, disregarding the liberties of the city in the process.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1495 Sever was provided to the see of Carlisle; the temporalities were restored on 11 December, and he was consecrated in 1496. His immediate predecessor at Carlisle, Richard Bell, had also been a monk before becoming a bishop; but whereas Bell, who had previously been prior of Durham, failed in his efforts to hold the priorate <i>in commendam</i>, Sever was able to remain abbot of St Mary's. Almost nothing is known of his episcopate, since his register does not survive, though he once arbitrated in a dispute involving one of his kinsmen. But in May 1496 he served on a commission appointed (unsuccessfully, at this time) to arrange for the marriage of the king's daughter Margaret with James IV, king of Scots, and for a treaty between the two realms, while in 1499 he was made a conservator of the Anglo-Scottish truce. In the latter year he came to play an important role in the extension of royal authority into northern England, being given special authority in the north in matters pertaining to the king's prerogative; appointed to be receiver and surveyor of wardships, marriages, and other rights belonging to the crown, he was expressly charged with the discovery of concealments. In this position Sever set a precedent for the establishment in 1508 of the office of surveyor of the king's prerogative.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1502 Sever was translated to the far wealthier see of Durham; the temporalities were restored on 15 October, and he now resigned his abbacy of St Mary's. As bishop of Durham he continued to work in the king's interest&#151;in a letter to Sir Reginald Bray, dated 7 December 1502, he reports a dispute over a woman (perhaps a wardship), and promises to tell Bray &#145;what I mean herein for the king's advantage&#146;  (Pollard, 390&#150;91). He died on an unknown day in 1505, and was buried in St Mary's Abbey at York.<br>
