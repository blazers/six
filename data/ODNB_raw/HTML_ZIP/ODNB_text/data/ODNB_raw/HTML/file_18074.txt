<span class="headword">Markland,  Jeremiah</span>  (1693&#150;1776), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 29 October 1693 at Childwell, Lancashire, one of the twelve children of Ralph Markland, vicar of that parish. He was admitted on the foundation of Christ's Hospital, London, in 1704 and in 1710 proceeded to St Peter's College, Cambridge, with an exhibition of &pound;30 p.a. for seven years. He graduated BA in 1714, proceeded MA in 1717, and was elected fellow and tutor of his college in 1718. In 1714 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Gratulations</span> and in 1717 he wrote some verses vindicating Addison against Pope's satire. He probably intended to take holy orders but his &#145;extreme weakness of the lungs&#146;  (Chalmers, 21.319) prevented him from pursuing a clerical career. Instead he remained at St Peter's until 1728, when he left to become private tutor to William Strode of Ponsbourne, Hertfordshire. He remained in this position for several years, accompanying Strode abroad to France, Flanders, and the Netherlands before returning to Cambridge in 1733.<br>
<br>From 1744 to 1752 Markland lived in Uckfield, Sussex, where he supervised the education of the son of his former pupil, William Strode. In 1752 he moved to Milton Court, near Dorking, Surrey, where for the remainder of his life he lived as a semi-recluse, maintaining contact with only a few friends, who included the printer William Bowyer, Strode, and the physician William Heberden. Despite the best efforts of his friends to persuade him he twice declined to compete for the Greek professorship at Cambridge declaring that &#145;instead of going an hundred miles to take it, I would go two hundred miles the other way to avoid it&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.278). In 1765 he became involved in a costly court case to defend Martha Rose, the widow with whom he lodged, against the claims on her money and property made by her son. The case was lost, as was Markland's &#145;whole fortune&#146; that had been &#145;expended on relieving the distress of the family&#146;  (ibid., 290). Although in much straitened circumstances he continued to refuse offers of financial help from his friends until in 1768 Strode persuaded him to accept an annuity of &pound;100.<br>
<br>Markland was an outstanding classical scholar and was described by John Nichols as &#145;one of the most learned and penetrating critics of the eighteenth century&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.272). He first distinguished himself in his <span class="italic">Epistola critica</span> (1723); this was followed by an edition of the <span class="italic">Silvae of Statius</span>, which restored the integrity of a much corrupted text. More controversially, in his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Epistles of Cicero to Brutus, and on Brutus to Cicero</span> (1745) he set out to prove that the attribution to Cicero of the four orations was spurious. Not all were convinced by his arguments, which have been subsequently disproved, and he became involved in a long and acrimonious debate with Conyers Middleton and others. In 1761 he published an excellent grammatical tract, <span class="italic">De Graecorum quinta declinatione imparisyllabica, et inde formata Latinorum tertia</span>. Probably the most esteemed and elaborate of his critical works was his edition of the <span class="italic">Euripedes drama supplices mulieres</span>, published anonymously in 1763 and reprinted in 1775. His other writings were either fragments that mainly were destroyed by himself in a spirit of dejection or contributions to other authors' works. Markland's contribution and character were summed up by Peter Elmsley:<blockquote>he was very laborious, loved retirement, and spent a long life in the study of the Greek and Latin languages. For modesty, candour, literary honesty and courteousness to other scholars, he is justly considered as the model which ought to be proposed for the imitation of every critic. (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 7, 1812, 442)</blockquote>In later years Markland suffered increasingly from painful attacks of gout. One such attack, accompanied by a fever, led to his death at Milton Court on 7 July 1776. He was buried in Dorking church, where a brass plaque, with an epitaph composed by his friend William Heberden, was placed on his gravestone. In accordance with his will his books and papers were bequeathed to Martha Rose.<br>
