<span class="headword">Fox,  Joseph</span>  (1775&#150;1816), <span class="occ">dental surgeon and philanthropist</span>, the only son of Joseph Fox (1733&#150;1795), dentist, and his wife, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1751, <i>d</i>. before 1795), daughter of the Revd John Rogers, a Baptist minister of Long Lane, Southwark, was born in Crooked Lane, Lombard Street, London, on 7 November 1775. Nothing is known of his early education except that he attended a school in Tooting kept by a Mr W. Lord, and was presumably trained in dentistry by his father. In 1795&#150;6 he was dresser to Henry Cline, the surgeon, having studied at Guy's Hospital since at least 1794, the year he was elected to its Physical Society (to which he gave a dissertation on the teeth on 3 October 1795). In 1796 he obtained the membership of the Company of Surgeons by examination, and when the company was reorganized under a new name in 1800 he consequently became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Fox practised at several addresses in London, mainly in Lombard Street with his cousin, John Fox, and his brother-in-law, Richard Downing. In 1808 he married Ann (1777&#150;1813), daughter of Joseph and Mary Gibbs. They had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1799 Fox began a course of lectures on the teeth to students at Guy's, and he continued as a lecturer there until his death. This was certainly the first series of lectures specifically on dentistry to be given in Britain, and probably in the world. On them he based his two books, <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Human Teeth</span> (1803) and <span class="italic">The History and Treatment of the Diseases of the Teeth</span> (1806), which were the first important dental works in English to have illustrations of operative dental procedures and of pathological dental conditions. Fox was also the first to give specific instructions for the correction of irregularities of the teeth. There were three English editions of his works, two American editions, and a French translation by Lemaire. These works were the first true textbooks on dentistry for students and practitioners, and for the next fifty years they were the most quoted ones in the English-speaking world.<br>
<br>Fox became a supporter of Edward Jenner after attending a meeting of the Physical Society in October 1798 at which vaccination was discussed, four months after the publication of Jenner's <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Cause and Effects of the Variolae vaccinae</span>. When the Royal Jennerian Society was established to further vaccination in January 1803, Fox became a vice-president and the first secretary, allowing part of his house to be used as a &#145;vaccinium&#146; by the society. In gratitude for his services he was presented with a silver medal in June 1803.<br>
<br>Fox also belonged to the Askesian Society, where he met influential men of science including the chemist William Allen, whose diary is the chief contemporary source for Fox's life and who became Fox's greatest friend and an associate in his philanthropical activities. Fox became a member of the Royal Institution on 10 March 1800 but never lectured there, though he presented a copy of his <span class="italic">Natural History</span> to the library.<br>
<br>Although Fox's lectures and dental practice continued until his early death, his final years were dominated by his work for the organized education of poor children; indeed the burden of travel, correspondence, and committee work for this was probably a major cause of his death. In November 1807 Fox attended a lecture by Joseph Lancaster on the latter's method of providing education on Christian but non-denominational principles for large numbers of children, with the senior pupils teaching the younger. Fox immediately appreciated the simplicity and efficiency of this scheme, which became the Royal Lancasterian Society. With William Allen and William Corston, a straw-hat manufacturer with an interest in industrial schools, Fox saved the society from bankruptcy in 1808 when Lancaster owed over &pound;6000; Fox provided &pound;2000 immediately and drew bills upon Corston for the remainder. Lancaster agreed to the appointment of trustees, and Fox became the first secretary and Allen the first treasurer. In 1814, when Lancaster again owed over &pound;8000, the committee took over the institution, changing its name to the British and Foreign School Society. The society developed schools both in Britain and abroad. In a debate in the House of Commons on 21 May 1816 Lord Brougham paid tribute to Fox for his salvation of the Lancasterian system of education.<br>
<br>In 1814 Fox became associated with Robert Owen, mill owner and socialist educationist, who wished to extend the educational and social experiments at his New Lanark Mills against the wishes of his partners. The necessary capital to buy the mills was provided by Fox (who contributed &pound;10,000) and others, on condition that the children should receive non-denominational religious teaching.<br>
<br>Fox was a friend of Josiah Wedgwood II (1769&#150;1843), and a series of letters to him in the autograph of Fox written between 1813 and 1816 is preserved in Keele University. These contain important information about the manufacture by Fox of porcelain artificial teeth, using materials supplied by Wedgwood. They reveal Fox's deep religious convictions and details of his workload, travels, and health, as well as his relations with Lancaster and Owen.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Fox suffered a series of &#145;spasmodic attacks&#146;. He died suddenly from a &#145;rupture of the gall bladder&#146; on 11 April 1816 at his home, 27 Argyle Street, London, and was buried on 18 April in the family vault of the Baptist meeting-house, Long Lane, Southwark.<br>
