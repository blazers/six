<span class="headword">Vandyk,  Carl</span>  (1851&#150;1931), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at Bunde, East Friesland, Hanover, Germany, on 17 January 1851 into a Jewish family. His father was Dutch and his mother was Portuguese. He emigrated to England and became a naturalized British subject, as did other members of his family, including his elder brother Aaron Vandyk (1842/3&#150;1892), who by 1871 was an artist and photographer in Liverpool, and who operated a photographic business in Liverpool's fashionable Lord Street. By 1871 Carl was also a photographer, in London, where from 1882 he had a studio at 125 Gloucester Road, and became a successful portrait photographer. His most important images, registered for copyright at Stationers' Hall, were a series of portraits of the king of Siam and his family (1902), the shah of Persia and members of his entourage (1902), and William Frederick Cody (Buffalo Bill), the American frontier scout and showman (1903), as well as the opera singers Alice Nielson (1904) and Enrico Caruso (1905). The portrait of the gaikwar of Baroda, which was much published as part of the campaign to emphasize the gaikwar's loyalty to the crown, is perhaps the best-known image credited to Carl Vandyk.<br>
<br>As well as being a successful commercial photographer Carl Vandyk had business interests in the catering trade and owned the Rembrandt, Rubens, and Vandyk hotels in London. He was an observant Jew who visited Bunde from time to time and played a role in supporting philanthropic institutions. With his wife, Henriette (Henny), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meyerhof (1854&#150;1931), he had five sons, including the photographer Herbert Vandyk [<i>see below</i>], and one daughter. He died at his home, 8J Bickenhall Mansions, Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, on 18 November 1931, his wife having died earlier in the same year.<br>
<br>Carl and Henriette Vandyk's eldest son <a name="cosubject_94668"></a><span class="headword">Herbert Vandyk</span>  (1879&#150;1943), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at 13 Artesian Road, Kensington, London, on 12 September 1879. He studied photography under his father and then, in his teens, spent several years in Paris working for the firm of Reutlinger, among others, before returning in 1900 to London, where he continued to work with his father. When Carl retired Herbert took over the business and in 1913 he rebuilt the studio at 37 Buckingham Palace Road, London.<br>
<br>Herbert Vandyk's approach to photography was that of a seasoned businessman with faith in his own powers. This was put into practice in his new &#145;walk-in&#146; premises that boasted two studios, one of which measured 56 feet in length by 36 feet wide with six mercury vapour lamps, a lounge, four dressing rooms, offices, and several darkrooms. He thereby brought to an end the era of often stuffy, cramped photographic studios on the top floors of buildings, which had made life particularly difficult for official portraits by their varying light quality and staircases generally unmanageable by ladies in huge swathes of court dress. The studio succeeded in convincing most sitters that the 12 inch by 10 inch plate, which was not the most reasonably priced, was in fact the most perfect size for the half- or three-quarter-length portrait.<br>
<br>By 1916 the studio employed more than fifty members of staff and sitters were welcome to glimpse the behind-the-scenes workings of the studio, as Herbert stated in a publicity article: &#145;I do not believe in the old idea that photographers benefited by the public looking upon our business as a mystery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Professional Photographer</span>, October 1916). Herbert Vandyk's success in receiving commissions from the British royal family was attributed by him to the fact that he always took &#145;a complete lighting outfit&#146; with him to Buckingham Palace, so that exposure times were reduced to a minimum&#151;a convenience much appreciated by his royal sitters  (<span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span>, 1 May 1935). His method of eliminating harsh shadows was achieved by an extensive battery of mercury vapour tubes and half-watt lamps that reduced the glare to the sitter's eyes from the extra spotlights. With an exposure time of less than one tenth of a second, he claimed to achieve &#145;spontaneity of expression&#146;.<br>
<br>During his working life Herbert Vandyk accumulated twenty-two royal warrants, a result of his having photographed possibly more visiting royalties than any other London photographer. A particularly important series of the crown prince of Serbia (later King Alexander II of Yugoslavia) was made shortly after the prince's epic flight at the head of his defeated army across the mountains into Albania. At the time of the sitting the prince had no country and Vandyk's portraits, published on 8 April 1916 in <span class="italic">The Illustrated London News</span> under the title &#145;Welcomed to London: a royal ally from the Near East&#146;, contributed greatly to the propaganda campaign that led to the creation of the new state of the south Slavs&#151;Yugoslavia.<br>
<br>Herbert Vandyk also appears to have been the most favoured photographer of the highly bejewelled Sir Bhupinder Singh, maharaja of Patiala (1891&#150;1938), who in 1926 invited Vandyk to go to India &#145;for the purpose of supervising the erection in the State Palace of a portrait studio built on the same plans as his own studio in Buckingham Palace Road&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, February 1943). Herbert's familiarity with the maharaja resulted in a series of singular portraits, as well as some extremely unusual domestic group portraits of the maharaja's wives, children, and dog in casual and intimate domestic poses not seen in any other Indian princely setting.<br>
<br>Other important series of images made by Herbert Vandyk include a number of portraits made in 1932 to memorialize the marriage of Azam Jah, prince of Berar (1907&#150;1970), to Khadija Hayriya Aisha Dur-i-Shahvar Sultana (<i>b</i>. 1914), which represented an abortive attempt by the prince's father, Asaf Jah VII, nizam of Hyderabad, to reposition his state at the centre of the Islamic world by marrying his son to the daughter of the last Ottoman caliph, Abdul Medjid II. This series includes the only known images of the caliph's wife Atiya Mihisti (1892&#150;1964).<br>
<br>After a brief illness, Herbert Vandyk died on 24 January 1943 at 11 Marais Mansions, Marais Road, Sea Point, Cape Town, South Africa, where his doctor had suggested he reside for the sake of his health. In 1964 the Vandyk company merged with the Bassano Studio and one year later it incorporated Elliott and Fry. The archive of Vandyk negatives as well as many original prints was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1974. Images from the collection have been shown at exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery (2001) and the Bucharest History Museum (2004), while studies of his maharaja series were published in 2001 and 2003.<br>
