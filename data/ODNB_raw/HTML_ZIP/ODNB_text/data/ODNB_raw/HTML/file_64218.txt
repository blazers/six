</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anrep, Boris Vasilyevich</span>, Count Elmpt in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1883&#150;1969), <span class="occ">mosaicist</span>, came of a noble Russian family. He was born on 28 September 1883 in St Petersburg, the son of Vasily Konstantinovich von Anrep (1852&#150;1927), a doctor who became the minister of education for south Russia and was a member of the third Duma (parliament), and his wife, Prascovya Zatsepina (<i>d</i>. 1918). His father founded the first hospital for women and the Institute of Pharmacology in St Petersburg. His mother was descended from Peter the Great's black slave, but adhered to the strict conventions of the late nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Anrep was training as an international lawyer when he made friends with a sculptor, Dmitry Stelletsky, who convinced him that he should be an artist. He went to Paris and studied art assiduously and afterwards mosaic-making. There, through the painter Henry Lamb he became friends with Duncan Grant and Augustus John. In 1906 he married Yuniya Khitrovo in Nice. When in 1912 Roger Fry asked him to choose Russian pictures for the second Post-Impressionist Exhibition, including drawings of his own, he also wrote a section of the introduction to the catalogue.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Anrep returned to Russia and got to know the poet Anna Akhmatova, who fell in love with him. He fought across the Carpathian mountains, where he discovered that the Orthodox church had turned Catholic. Priests had cast out the icons into the open or sheds where they mouldered. At night Anrep would go with his Cossacks and a cart into no man's land to collect these religious paintings. Most of those he retrieved are now in the Hermitage Museum. Following his divorce in 1918 Anrep married Helen Ann (1885&#150;1965), daughter of William Maitland, on 12 April 1918 in Hampstead. On his marriage certificate his rank and profession were described as &#145;Captain Russian Artillery, Military Secretary to the Russian Govt. Committee&#146;. Living in London after the war he took up mosaics to earn a living for his wife and two children. The floor in the Tate Gallery was a success from which other commissions followed, both public and private. In the National Gallery he created three floors, one portraying his Bloomsbury and other friends as Greek gods and goddesses. On the Bank of England pavements the governor, Montague Norman, is to be seen as Janus looking both ways. Anrep always enjoyed making intricate jokes in his mosaics; he also used many symbols, such as zigzag electric sparks for fast modern communication; banking and finance were indicated by two entwined snakes writhing round a caduceus. These mosaics are down long corridors and halls and are among his finest.<br>
<br>Anrep taught his many helpers in the Parisian studio to assist in the making of mosaics, for they could take up to six years to complete. These workers were Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, who found it hard to make a living in France. Among these refugees was Mariya Volkova, who had lived with the family since 1917, much to his wife's disgust. He had a quantity of lovers, including Jeanne Reynal, and was very attractive to women. But when Helen Anrep left him to live with Roger Fry, Anrep was furious. He threatened to tar and feather Fry, though he never carried out the threat.<br>
<br>For private commissions Anrep created a Byzantine party on Ethel Sands's hall floor; for Augustus John a huge mantelpiece, with mistresses, wives, and children dotted all over the scene (V&amp;A). For Lady Jowitt he made a pavement showing a modern lady of fashion of the 1920s in black and white marble (Birmingham Art Gallery). In various panels she was seen trying on a dress, gossiping on the telephone, and at the theatre.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Anrep worked for Reuters, doing concurrent translations from Russian into English. In 1946 he became a naturalized British citizen, having given up the idea that he could ever return to his estates and house in St Petersburg. Then the fourth National Gallery floor was arranged, where he showed Winston Churchill in his siren suit defying a monster, with Professor Hoyle scaling a tower, the height of lucidity. Besides this, his mosaics for Greek and Catholic cathedrals and chapels in England, Ireland, and Scotland, including ceilings and walls, and the chapel of the blessed sacrament in Westminster Cathedral, are on a magnificent scale.<br>
<br>Anrep was adventurous and bold; his physique was like that of a big, blond, medieval knight; when in company his wit, vivacity, charm, and story-telling were irresistible. But he could become deeply depressed over criticism or personal troubles. He died in London on 7 June 1969 at the home of his last mistress, Maud Russell, 6 Hyde Park Gardens, and was cremated on 11 June in Golders Green cemetery.<br>
