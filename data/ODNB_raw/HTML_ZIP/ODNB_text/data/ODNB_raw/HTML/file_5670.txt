<span class="headword">Clifton,  John Charles</span>  (1781&#150;1841), <span class="occ">music teacher</span>, was born in London on 7 November 1781. His father intended him to become a merchant, but his early talent for music was such that he was placed in the care of a relative, Richard Bellamy, with whom he studied music for five years. He then became a pupil of Charles Wesley, and eventually decided to follow music as a profession, giving up a position as a clerk in the Stationery Office which he had held for about two years.<br>
<br>Clifton's first professional engagement was at Bath, where he conducted the Harmonic Society. In 1802 he went to Dublin and became a music master, and in 1816 he produced there a successful piece, <span class="italic">Edwin and Angelina</span> (after Goldsmith), written with Sir John Stevenson. He also organized, with Stevenson, a large-scale concert in aid of famine relief in Ireland. About 1816 he invented an instrument to aid sight-singing called the &#145;Eidomusicon&#146;, which does not appear to have been patented. About the same time he finished a plan of music education detailed in his <span class="italic">Theory of Harmony Simplified</span>, and about 1817 lectured in Dublin on both the plan and the invention. In 1818 Clifton moved to London in order to have his ideas published, but the project proved too expensive and impractical. He then adopted the Logierian system of musical instruction, and for some years was a teacher of repute in London; he also became an associate of the Philharmonic Society. He married the proprietress of Teresa House, a ladies' boarding-school in Hammersmith, where the last years of his life were spent, and where he taught singing and the piano for a time. His compositions consist chiefly of songs and glees, one of which gained the prize offered by the Manchester Glee Club.<br>
<br>Around 1838 Clifton's mental health deteriorated and he became possessed with the idea that he was enormously wealthy; the delusion grew to such an extent that it was found necessary to place him under a gentle restraint. The <span class="italic">Musical World</span> (25 November 1841) described how, &#145;even during this time, the generosity of his heart was made manifest by his anxiety to make very handsome presents to his friends and acquaintances&#146;. He died at Teresa House on 18 November 1841.<br>
