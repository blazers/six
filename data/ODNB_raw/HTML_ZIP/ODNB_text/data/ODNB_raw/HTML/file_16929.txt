<span class="headword">Loewenthal,  Johann Jacob</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>J&aacute;nos Jakab L&ouml;wenthal]</span>  (1810&#150;1876), <span class="occ">chess player</span>, son of a Hungarian merchant, was born at Budapest in July 1810. He was educated at the <i>Gymnasium</i> of his native town, and received his first chess lessons from Szen, the noted Hungarian player, then a clerk in the archives at Pest. In 1842&#150;5 he helped Szen and Grimm win a correspondence match with the celebrated Cercle des Echecs of Paris. He also travelled to Vienna and Berlin to play von Heydebrandt and study under Lasa, Anderssen, and other masters. Though a non-combatant in the revolutions of 1849, Loewenthal was an ardent follower of Kossuth, and held a civil appointment under his administration; thus he was expelled from Austro-Hungary in 1849, and sought refuge in the United States of America. For some time he ran a club in Cincinnati; he also played the twelve-year-old Paul Morphy, who beat him twice, with one draw.<br>
<br>In 1851 Loewenthal visited Britain to take part in a chess tournament; being unsuccessful, he was reluctant to return to America. Howard Staunton procured him the secretaryship of the St George's chess club (1852&#150;5). He also became chess editor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated News of the World</span> and of <span class="italic">The Era</span> (1854&#150;67). He welcomed Morphy to London in 1858, accepted with a good grace defeat (by nine games to three with three draws) in a match with him, and published in 1860 <span class="italic">Morphy's Games of Chess, with Analytical and Critical Notes</span>.<br>
<br>Matches were never Loewenthal's forte: &#145;he was, indeed, the most uneven player of his time &hellip; Staunton complained most irascibly of his &#147;glaring oversights&#148; and &#147;stupendous blunders&#148;&#151;and they were no less exasperating because he seemed to blunder against everyone except Staunton himself&#146;  (Cole and Diggle, 308); but &#145;it is not too much to say that his theoretical knowledge of the game was unrivalled&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 119). None the less, he won the tournament of 1857 at Manchester&#151;beating Horwitz and Anderssen&#151;and that of 1858 at Birmingham, beating Staunton. In 1853, unfortunately, being something of a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Staunton, he was persuaded into a match, effectively as Staunton's representative, against the latter's rival Harrwitz. Sneered at by the <span class="italic">British Chess Review</span> as &#145;the wandering Jew&#146; and harassed by Harrwitz's partisans with organ-grinders and cigar-smokers, the series' thirty-three games finally proved too much, and Loewenthal lost by ten games to eleven. Staunton was distinctly cooler to him thereafter.<br>
<br>Loewenthal was appointed manager of the great London chess congress of 1862, in which the first prize was taken by Anderssen, and in which he tied with Joseph Blackburne for eighth place after abandoning his last games. Thereafter, he concentrated on the administrative and literary side of chess. He edited the <span class="italic">Chess Player's Magazine</span> throughout its life from 1863 to 1867, and was, from 1865 to 1869, manager of the British Chess Association, of which Lord Lyttelton was president. After the secretaryship of the St George's (a post perhaps dependent on Staunton's continued patronage), he was from 1857 to 1864 president of the St James's chess club and from 1872 president of the City of London. Loewenthal became a naturalized British subject in 1866. The following year, a German speaker found: &#145;so anxious was he both in outward appearance and manner to be taken for an Englishman that he would rather converse in broken French &hellip; than have recourse to German, which of course he spoke fluently&#146;  (Hoffer, 754). Loewenthal was a friend and frequent opponent at chess of W. G. Ward, under whose influence he joined the Roman Catholic church. By 1874 he needed the support of a subscription fund of &pound;500. He retired to the Sussex coast because of illness and died, unmarried, at Burlington House, St Leonards, Sussex, on 20 July 1876. The residue of the subscription funded a Loewenthal memorial cup for the county chess championship.<br>
