<span class="headword">Bailey, Sir  Abraham <span class="st"> [Abe]</span></span>, first baronet  (1864&#150;1940), <span class="occ">financier and politician in South Africa</span>, was born at Cradock, Cape Colony, on 6 November 1864, the only son of Thomas Bailey (<i>d</i>. 1905) of Keighley, Yorkshire, a shopkeeper of Queenstown, which he represented in the Eastern Circle division for the Afrikaner Bond in the Cape legislative council. His mother was Ann Drummond (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of Peter McEwan of Muthill, Crieff, Perthshire. Bailey was educated in England at the Keighley trade and grammar School and at Clewer House, near Windsor.<br>
<br>After leaving school Bailey worked for a while in a textile firm. Returning to the Cape in 1881 he temporarily ran his father's business until he joined in the Barberton gold rush, arriving there in July 1886. He began dealing in shares with a capital of &pound;100 which he lost. Borrowing &pound;10 from a friend, he took out a broker's licence, and started dealing on the Barberton stock exchange. Leaving Barberton in March 1887, he went to the Witwatersrand goldfields where he became a foundation member of the Johannesburg stock exchange in January 1888. Soon Bailey started acquiring mining properties and extensive real estate operations.<br>
<br>Described as a &#145;freewheeling promoter&#146; rather than a company developer, Bailey nevertheless played a significant role in the capitalization of the mining industry, particularly in the period immediately after the South African War. In 1897 he formed a company which, by Rand standards, was modest. This was the South African Gold Mines Company which had very substantial holdings of deep-level shares and properties by 1904. In 1905 he entered into a partnership with Julius Jeppe and founded what became the South African Townships, Mining and Finance Corporation, ranked among the &#145;big ten&#146; which controlled Rand gold mining [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95075', "Randlords")</script>]. Bailey was chairman of the latter as well as of the London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company, one of the greatest holders of land and mining properties in Rhodesia, having taken a keen interest in the future of that country since the establishment of his friend Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company in 1889. He was a director of the influential London-based Central Mining and Investment Corporation Ltd and among the first shareholders in Rand Mines Ltd.<br>
<br>In 1894 Bailey married Caroline Mary (<i>d</i>. 1902), elder daughter of John Paddon, a Kimberley merchant. His second wife, whom he married on 5 September 1911, was Mary (1890&#150;1960) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30528/', "Bailey, Dame Mary, Lady Bailey")</script>], only daughter of Derrick Warner William Westenra, fifth Baron Rossmore. Mary Bailey was well known as an airwoman in the early days of flying and in 1930 was created a dame of the British empire for her services to aviation. Bailey and his first wife had a son, John Milner (1900&#150;1946), who succeeded him as second baronet, and one daughter. There were a further two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73847/', "James Richard Abe Bailey (1919&#150;2000)")</script>, and three daughters from his second marriage.<br>
<br>Known as the prince of the South African racing scene, Bailey became one of the largest breeders and owners of racehorses both in England and in South Africa, where he established a stud farm in Orange Free State and bred a fine line of winners. Bailey was an unusually successful gambler at the track as well as on the stock exchange. His most famous horse, Son-in-Law, which won the Cesarewitch and the Goodwood Cup, was also a great sire. Son-in-Law's son Foxlaw won the 1927 Gold Cup and Straitlace won the Oaks in 1924. Bailey's classic success was winning the Oaks in 1936 with Lovely Rose, and he was second in the Derby of 1935 with Robin Goodfellow. Bailey also took a keen interest in farming, and raised all kinds of livestock using scientific methods on his farm in the Colesberg district of the Cape.<br>
<br>Bailey began his public service on the Johannesburg health committee in the early 1890s. He was a member of the Reform Committee and for his part in the Jameson raid of 1895 was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, afterwards commuted to a fine of &pound;2000. He served in the South African War as an intelligence officer in the 11th division and helped to raise an irregular corps. He rose to the rank of major, was twice mentioned in dispatches and received the king's and queen's medals and five clasps. During the war he formed a lasting friendship with the young British war correspondent Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, later acting as his financial adviser. Churchill's daughter Diana married Bailey's eldest son, John, in 1932 but the union was short lived. In 1902 he entered the Cape legislative assembly as Progressive representative for Barkly West, Cecil Rhodes's old constituency, but resigned in 1905. After responsible government was granted to Transvaal in 1906, he represented Krugersdorp from 1907 to 1910 in the legislative assembly, becoming the opposition whip to the administration of General Louis Botha. He actively promoted the union of the four South African colonies, helping to finance <i>The State</i>, the organ of the Closer Union Society, which was founded to popularize the cause.<br>
<br>In 1915 Bailey was elected to the South African parliament as an independent member representing his old constituency, Krugersdorp, but sitting with General Botha's South African Party and not with the Unionists as was expected. He retained the seat until his defeat at the general election of 1924. During the 1914 rising and the South-West Africa campaign Bailey had served under General Louis Botha with the rank of major, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He was similarly honoured by France in the First World War. He held strong views on political issues, especially on the Indian question, and in 1922 publicly expressed the wish that all the Indians should leave South Africa.<br>
<br>Through his South African Mails Syndicate and its two mouthpieces, the <span class="italic">Rand Daily Mail</span>, Transvaal's leading morning newspaper, and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, founded by him, as well as through his great wealth, Bailey was able to exercise considerable influence. From the early 1920s he divided his time between England and South Africa. He was famous for the hospitality which he dispensed at Rust-en-Vrede, his Muizenberg home near Cape Town, and at his London residence, 38 Bryanston Square. His skill and tact as a host made his homes places for the interchange of opinions and debate and at times neutral territory for the settlement of political differences. The critical meeting of 3 December 1916 which led to Lloyd George succeeding Herbert Asquith as prime minister was held at 38 Bryanston Square, and Bailey also urged Lloyd George to have Churchill in his new government. In March 1933 generals Smuts and Hertzog met at Rust-en-Vrede to form a coalition government for South Africa, although Bailey personally did not participate in these deliberations.<br>
<br>Bailey was an all-round sportsman whose great love for sport went back to 1894 when he captained the Transvaal team in the Currie cup cricket tournament at Newlands in the Cape. He also financed the visit of a South African cricket team to England in 1904. In his youth he had been a boxing enthusiast, trained by J. R. Couper whom he successfully backed in the famous fight against Wolf Bendorff (backed by B. Barnato), on 26 July 1889. Bailey was made a KCMG in 1911 for his services in promoting the unification of South Africa, and created a baronet in 1919 for services rendered during the First World War. He died at Rust-en-Vrede on 10 August 1940, having suffered the amputation of both legs, the first in July 1937 and the second in April 1938. He was buried five days later at Rust-en-Vrede. Under the terms of his will he left a quarter of his estate to the Abe Bailey Trust, which was to be established to further good relations between all white South Africans. His pictures at Bryanston Square were also put in trust for the nation. He bequeathed &pound;100,000 or &pound;5000 a year to the Royal Institute of International Affairs, for research. In 1925 he had purchased the valuable library of Charles Aiken Fairbridge, prominent Cape Town solicitor and book collector, and donated it to the South African Library, Cape Town. He also financed the addition of a wing to the library to house the collection.<br>
