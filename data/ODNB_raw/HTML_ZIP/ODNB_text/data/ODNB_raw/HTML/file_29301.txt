<span class="headword">Whiter,  Walter</span>  (1758&#150;1832), <span class="occ">philologist and literary scholar</span>, born at Birmingham on 30 October 1758, was at King Henry VIII Grammar School, Coventry, for ten years, under Dr Edwards, where Robert Bree MD was a fellow pupil. He was admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, on 19 June 1776 as sizar, and graduated BA (1781) and MA (1784). On 4 April 1782 he was elected a fellow of Clare, probably on account of his reputation for classical and philological knowledge. He lived in his rooms in college from 1782 to 1797. Richard Porson was one of his closest friends, and often wrote notes on the margin of Whiter's books. Porson in 1786 added some notes of his own and of Whiter to an edition by Hutchinson of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Anabasis</span>. These were issued separately from Valpy's press in 1810, and George Townsend added them to his edition of 1823.<br>
<br>Whiter was ordained priest in 1783, and was presented by his college in 1797 to the rectory of Hardingham in Norfolk; he held the benefice until his death. His clerical role did not inhibit his lively spirits. Baron Merian, in a letter to Dr Samuel Butler of Shrewsbury School, writes: &#145;I pity Whiter. A great etymologist, perhaps the greatest that ever lived. A genius certainly, but it seems, like most eminent artists, dissolute&#146;  (S. Butler, <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 1896, 1.186). Every year on 23 April, the day of St George (titular saint of Hardingham church), it was his harmless practice to collect his friends at a picnic under a beech on a hillock called St George's Mount, and to claim from each of them an appropriate poem in Latin or English. A specimen of his verses on one of these occasions is in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (86/1, 1816, 542&#150;3).<br>
<br>Whiter's first published work was <span class="italic">A Specimen of a Commentary on Shakspeare</span> (1794), containing notes on <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> and &#145;an attempt to explain and illustrate various passages on a new principle of criticism derived from Mr Locke's doctrine of the association of ideas&#146;. Its contemporary reception was limited and critical. &#145;Such reviews as do exist, while agreeing on the commendation of Whiter's extreme learning, find his views too eccentric and his claims too inflated to make his book of any permanent value&#146;  (Whiter, <span class="italic">Specimen of a Commentary</span>, xxxi). It therefore went unnoticed by Coleridge, Hazlitt, and the Victorian critics. Only in the twentieth century was Whiter's perceptive treatment of trains of ideas and image clusters given its due, and seen to anticipate the work of such Shakespearian critics as Caroline Spurgeon and W. H. Clemens.<br>
<br>Whiter's other works include the first part of <span class="italic">Etymologicon Magnum</span> (1800), a universal etymological dictionary on a new plan, in the preface to which he enlarged on the value of the Romani language. These views and his word-speculations interested George Borrow, who made his acquaintance and introduced him, as understanding some twenty languages, into <span class="italic">Lavengro</span> (1851). Jeffrey wrote two articles on the <span class="italic">Etymologicon Magnum</span> in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (June and July 1802), assigning to Whiter &#145;much labour and shrewdness, with a considerable share of credulity&#146;. Whiter also produced the <span class="italic">Etymologicon universale, or, Universal Etymological Dictionary on a New Plan</span> (vols. 1 and 2, 1822; vol. 3, 1825). These three large quarto volumes were printed partly at the cost of Cambridge University Press. The first volume was originally issued in 1811, and the preface to the first volume in the collected edition of 1822&#150;5 retained the date 15 May 1811. In this work Whiter set out that &#145;consonants are alone to be regarded in discovering the affinities of words, and that the vowels are to be wholly rejected; that languages contain the same fundamental idea, and that they are derived from the earth&#146;. Baron Merian styled it &#145;splendid, a very fine book indeed&#146;  (S. Butler, <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 1896, 1.185) but modern lexicographers have found the etymologies unpersuasive. In <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Disorder of Death, or that State called Suspended Animation</span> (1819), Whiter tried to show how the apparently dead should be treated with a view to their restoration to life. In the advertisement at the end he announced a series of essays to be called <span class="italic">Nova tentamina mythologica, or, Attempts to unfold various portions of mythology by a new principle</span>, but these were never printed and are now, with other manuscripts of Whiter, in the Cambridge University Library  (<span class="italic">CUL Cat. of MSS</span>, 4.521, 543&#150;4). Whiter died at Hardingham rectory on 23 July 1832, and was buried in the churchyard on 30 July, a large railed-in tomb being erected to his memory. A bust of him was placed in the library at Clare College but is now lost without trace.<br>
