<span class="headword">Abendana,  Jacob</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1685), <span class="occ">leader of the Sephardi Jewish community in London</span>, was born in Spain and was taken with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37091/', "Isaac Abendana")</script> to Hamburg, Germany, as a child. Jacob studied at the Yeshiva de los Pintos at Rotterdam, and at the age of twenty-five he was already a rabbi in Amsterdam. As early as 1660 or 1661 he was in contact with Adam Boreel, the continental Christian Hebraist of the circle dominated by John Durie and Samuel Hartlib, who commissioned him to translate the <span class="roman">Mishnah</span>, the Hebrew part of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, into Spanish. After finishing this task Jacob collaborated with his brother Isaac to put out in 1662 an edition of the <span class="italic">Mikhlal yofi</span>, Solomon ibn Melik's thirteenth-century commentary on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, with Rabbi Jacob's own supercommentary. The work was published with the approbations of Christian scholars, including the celebrated Jean Buxtorf the younger, which was a new departure for Jewish authors of a Hebrew book. Jacob Abendana followed up this success with a Spanish translation of Judah HaLevi's twelfth-century <span class="italic">Kuzari</span>, which was published in 1663 and was dedicated to Sir William Davidson, the English resident in Holland.<br>
<br>By the beginning of 1668 Jacob had joined his brother Isaac in England, and with him he set about selling Hebrew books to a devoted clientele that included Henry Oldenburg, Robert Boyle, and Thomas Barlow of the Bodleian Library. During this visit to London the Jewish community there gave Abendana a gift equivalent to the yearly salary of the congregation's rabbi, perhaps in the hope that he would stay. In fact he returned to Amsterdam, but in 1681 he agreed to serve as leader of the English Sephardi community, which had been so generous to him years before. In that year he was host to the Princess Anne, who came to the synagogue during passover, the first occasion on which a member of the royal family visited the Jews at prayer.<br>
<br>Jacob Abendana died in London in 1685; he had no children. Although his Spanish translation of the <span class="roman">Mishnah</span> was never published, and indeed is now lost, when Surenhusius began publishing his own Latin version at Amsterdam in 1698 he paid tribute to Abendana's work.<br>
