<span class="headword">Doody,  Samuel</span>  (1656&#150;1706), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Staffordshire on 28 May 1656, the eldest child of the second marriage of John Doody, a local apothecary who afterwards moved to London. He assisted his father at his shop in the Strand and succeeded him in business about 1696. His interest in botany is shown in an account of an excursion he made to Gravesend in 1686, when many rare plants were found, and in his commonplace book which notes the dates of the apothecaries' herborizing expeditions for 1687 and 1688, and contains many lists of plants. Doody seems to have been a modest man, and, according to Adam Buddle  (MS Sloane 2972), very slow of speech and unable to express himself adequately, but full of good argument and sound reasoning when able to exert himself. His particular interest lay in the study of mosses, fungi, and other non-flowering plants, in which little-studied field he was the acknowledged expert of his time. A possible draft for his intended publication on mosses is in the Sloane manuscripts  (BL, MS Sloane 2315). His dilatoriness in passing on his observations may account for his failure to publish, although dried plant specimens sent to colleagues are found in many volumes in the Sloane herbarium. Doody was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1695. His only publication, a letter on a case of dropsy in the breast, was published in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>  (19, 1697, 390).<br>
<br>Among Doody's close botanical acquaintances were Ray, Plukenet, Petiver&#151;with whom he was particularly friendly&#151;and Sloane, and he was a member of the Temple Coffee House Botanical Club. Ray acknowledged Doody's help in 1688 in the second volume of <span class="italic">Historia plantarum</span>, and the appendix to the second edition of his <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> (1696) contains a long list of plant records due to Doody. Plukenet and other authors of the period also acknowledged his assistance. The new plants he saw on his herborizing expeditions around London, often in the company of Buddle and Petiver, are noted in his own copy of the 1696 edition of <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, now in the British Library; some of these notes were later used by Dillenius in preparing the third edition. In 1692, having reported to the Society of Apothecaries the unsatisfactory management of their physic garden at Chelsea, Doody offered to maintain the garden for a year, free of charge, a decision applauded by Ray as likely to &#145;much promote botanics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Further Correspondence</span>, 175). The following year Doody was appointed to take control for three years at a salary of &pound;100 per annum. He continued to be involved in the running of the garden until his death.<br>
<br>Doody suffered much from gout, and was notorious for an unspecified failing, apparently intemperance. He never married, and died, after some weeks' illness, at the end of November 1706. He was buried at Hampstead, Middlesex, on 3 December, his funeral sermon being preached by his old friend, Adam Buddle. He is commemorated in the genus of ferns <i>Doodia</i>.<br>
