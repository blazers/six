<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nuttall,  Jeffrey Addison <span class="st"> [Jeff]</span></span>  (1933&#150;2004), <span class="occ">artist and author</span>, was born on 8 July 1933 at 8 York Street, Clitheroe, Lancashire, the son of Kenneth Nuttall, schoolteacher, and his wife, Hilda Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Addison. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98607/', "Anthony David (Tony) Nuttall (1937&#150;2007)")</script>, became a distinguished Shakespearian scholar. He grew up near the Welsh border, in Orcop, Herefordshire, where his father was the village schoolmaster, but he was largely educated in Hereford and at art school there, leaving in 1951. He then did his national service in the Royal Army Education Corps. On 17 July 1954 he married his art teacher, Janet (Jane) Louch, five years his senior, and the daughter of Peter Louch, bricklayer; they had a daughter and three sons. He described himself on his marriage certificate as &#145;artist&#146;. He initially developed as a painter, but became interested in all the arts. From 1956 to 1968 he worked as an art teacher at various secondary schools; he then spent sixteen years working at art colleges, in Bradford, Leeds, and Liverpool (latterly as head of fine arts at Liverpool Polytechnic). He had a special ability to inspire in others a concept of art as a force to stimulate the imagination and thereby escape from habit-living, selfish ambition, and middle-class complacency. He was an inspired teacher, but his radical ideas frequently landed him in trouble. He taught his students to look at things in new ways, recognizing disorder and chaos as being as natural to life as class-based law and order.<br>
<br>Although he made his mark as an artist (with both joint and one-man exhibitions), poet, writer, actor, and musician, it was as a pioneer of the &#145;happening&#146; in Britain that Nuttall was perhaps best known in his own lifetime. The late 1950s and early 1960s were an exciting period in life and especially in the arts, due to the rising affluence of the post-war generation and the abandonment of restrictive middle-class culture and values by those who had enjoyed free state higher education. The theatre in particular was going through a revolutionary period far removed from the Coward&#150;Maugham&#150;Rattigan tradition with not only Beckett, Brecht, Osborne, and absurdist and expressionist trends dominating, but Dadaist and &#145;happening&#146; theatrical innovation emerging too. This last trend immediately appealed to Nuttall, who became an actor and happening-innovator. In a notable Nuttall happening at Better Books, an avant-garde bookshop in central London, actors threw large pieces of raw offal at each other, often hitting the audience. His public performances featured jazz&#151;he was a competent trumpet player and pianist&#151;spoken verse, and improvised acting, frequently using his rich and resonant voice for both singing and recitation. In 1967 he co-founded the People Show, which performed everywhere it could, often on a busy street or dockside, using scripts that Nuttall wrote for the occasion, many of which were later published. These were not only shocking, but sometimes even frightening. Audiences who stopped on the street to watch an unusual event, not realizing that it was a rehearsed dramatic performance, were, as Nuttall saw it, experiencing an awareness of art in their lives. On one occasion some actors booked rooms in a hotel, while others used the public rooms pretending to be either guests or police detectives investigating a murder that had taken place there, until the whole building was in a panic, whereupon the actors all disappeared. In two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Performance Art</span> (1979), one containing scripts and the other descriptions of performances, Nuttall vividly described the activities of the People Show.<br>
<br>Nuttall was an important figure in many other aspects of the 1960s counter-culture. For three years from 1965 he edited his own journal, <span class="italic">My Own Mag</span>, and from its inception in 1966 he contributed cartoons and articles to <span class="italic">International Times</span>, which when sued had to shorten its title to the initials <span class="italic">IT</span>. He took part in a notorious poetry event at the Albert Hall in June 1965, where Alexander Trocchi, Allen Ginsberg, Christopher Logue, and an international collection of poets gave readings in an atmosphere full of marijuana smoke, where the psychiatrist&#150;poet R. D. Laing brought a number of very disturbed mental patients, and where Nuttall himself performed covered entirely in blue paint (an emergency hot bath being required to save him from certain death). The entire box-office takings disappeared, together with two of the organizers, and only a few performers who had been recorded by the BBC received any payment or expenses. But the event was a major factor in making Nuttall better known.<br>
<br>In 1968 he again came to prominence as the author of <span class="italic">Bomb Culture</span>, which had much to do with his anti-nuclear activities (he was involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Committee of 100). The argument advanced in <span class="italic">Bomb Culture</span> was that in an age when life could end at any time, either by design or accident, with the major nations able and threatening to destroy each other, young people had to live for the pleasure of the moment. The book was quoted in the House of Commons during a debate on the unruly and much criticized behaviour of the youth of the day, and became a modest best-seller.<br>
<br>Nuttall published some forty books, including many volumes of poetry, between 1963 and the final <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> a year before his death. His novels included <span class="italic">Come Back, Sweet Prince</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Pig</span> (1969), <span class="italic">The House Party</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">Snipe's Spinster</span> (1975). Some of his publications were biographies, including one of Frank Randle, the northern music-hall comedian (1978). His interests were wide and he often tried to bring together high and popular culture. He knew and appreciated the classics, especially in the visual arts and music. He had a special feeling for traditional jazz.<br>
<br>In 1979 Nuttall became poetry critic for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and his <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> began to sell well. He continued to perform happenings and on one occasion, largely to publicize his books at the invitation of one of his publishers, he went to the American booksellers' convention in Atlanta where, his large overweight body bound up in nothing but tight sellotape, he walked around among the publishers' stands as the climax of a fictitious quest to discover a missing person. But the police were called and he had to be quickly hidden. In New York he was fascinated by the graffiti on the subway trains and spent hours watching them pass. Any art, however improvised or amateur, was to him a certain indication that in any society artists will find a way to express themselves.<br>
<br>Nuttall's open friendliness and generosity in helping others and collaborating with any activity that took his fancy made him many friends, and few could resist his charm. When his marriage foundered (he was divorced in 1979) he developed other relationships, travelling abroad for a time with Amanda Porter, with whom he had two more sons. His heavy drinking, especially of beer, led to much ill health and occasional hospitalization later in life. But he continued to work at anything that was within his capacity, and his large rotund shape made him ideal for certain parts on stage and screen, Falstaff and Friar Tuck, for instance. He played in many films (notably in <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, 1991), less on the stage because of the discipline and relative sobriety required. He was a good public speaker, but could not help bringing into his public appearances the obscenities that littered his normal conversation. His poetry was rich and unusual, heavy with symbolism and associated imagery, surrealist in its effect, understandable but random, depending on stream of consciousness. Nevertheless his written work was so varied that it is difficult to generalize about it. When he wanted to be clear and incisive, he was. This was most obvious in his <span class="italic">Art and the Degradation of Awareness</span> (1999). Too many art critics, he argued, had gone overboard in praising or accepting conceptual works that had no real skill behind them, or, even where there was an element of craftsmanship, no content. Some art was meaningless, harmless, and did not try to make much of a point. But other art, just as meaningless, was idolized. Associated principally with the lifestyle of the artist, such art was simply passing fashion and even if it survived for a while in a museum could not be art in any meaningful sense. Nuttall had been a rebel and had liked to shock, but only in the sense of introducing unexpected surprise into people's lives, thereby stimulating the imagination. He retained a sense of values, and lamented the &#145;degradation&#146; of artistic standards.<br>
<br>During his last year Nuttall continued working, promoting his work, accepting speaking engagements, and occasionally playing a small part in a film. His last partner was (Margaret) Jill Richards, with whom he lived in Crickhowell, Brecknockshire. (It was no coincidence that he spent so much of his time in or near Wales. He was almost Welsh in his upbringing and he had a special love of Dylan Thomas, whom in many ways he resembled, both physically and in lifestyle.) It had long been his practice to play his cornet on Sundays in the Hen and Chicks pub in Abergavenny with a jazz group, and it was on 4 January 2004, at the end of such a performance, that he was suddenly taken ill. He was pronounced dead at Nevill Hall Hospital, Abergavenny, the same day, the cause of death being given as coronary artery disease. He was survived by his six children.<br>
<br>Among twentieth-century British artists, none deserved the description of Renaissance man more than Jeff Nuttall, who aside from being a painter, poet, novelist, actor, musician, playwright, and critic, was a polemicist and promoter of the power of the imagination to bring spiritual and non-materialistic values and attitudes into life. In his case his artistic drive was instinctive and natural, having nothing to do with ambition or any desire for recognition. Worldly success was of little importance to him compared to the realization that he was exploiting his natural interests to the limits of his ability. He was a bon viveur who enjoyed his life, did most things to excess, and whose only enemy lay in narrow-minded attitudes and over-respect for tradition or slavery to fashion. In spite of a personality that most people would call anarchic, he believed in real values, in discipline, and a hierarchy of talent. No one represented the spirit of the 1960s better than Jeff Nuttall.<br>
