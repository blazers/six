<span class="headword">Wardlaw <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Halket]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Lady Wardlaw  (1677&#150;1727), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 15 April 1677, the daughter of Sir Charles Halket, baronet, of Pitfirran, Fife, and Janet, daughter of Sir Patrick Murray. She married Sir Henry Wardlaw, baronet, of Pitreavie in 1696 and subsequently bore three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Wardlaw was said to have been &#145;a woman of elegant accomplishments, <i>who wrote other poems</i>, and practiced drawing, and cutting paper with her scissors, and <i>who had much wit and humour</i>&#146;  (Chambers, 14). She died in 1727, and posthumously became a topic of much antiquarian discourse.<br>
<br>Wardlaw was the author of the ballad imitation &#145;Hardyknute&#146;. The poem describes a battle between Haco, king of Norway, and Alexander III of Scotland&#151;the battle of Largs, 2 October 1263; by the victory, largely due to the lord high steward of Scotland, Hardyknute, Scotland gained the Hebrides and the Isle of Man. Published in 1719 on folio sheets, the poem was not attributed. Somewhat later, it was republished, in extended form, in Allan Ramsay's <span class="italic">Ever Green</span> (1724) and in a variety of other antiquarian publications, reaching its apogee when it appeared in Thomas Percy's <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span> in 1765, courtesy of David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, who had also sent Percy such &#145;canonical&#146; exemplars of balladry as &#145;Sir Patrick Spense&#146;, &#145;Gil Morrice&#146;, &#145;Edward, Edward&#146;, &#145;Jew's Daughter&#146;, &#145;Young Waters&#146;, &#145;Edom o' Gordon&#146;, and &#145;Bonny Earl of Murray&#146;. In the second edition of the <span class="italic">Reliques</span>, dated 1767, Lady Wardlaw is named as author.<br>
<br>This set the stage for what became, in the words of Norval Clyne, the Lady Wardlaw heresy. It may have begun with David Laing and/or C. K. Sharpe, and subsequently other antiquaries, seeing a similarity between &#145;Hardyknute&#146; and the other ballads sent from Scotland to Percy; a logical extension of this surmise was the attribution of the works to Lady Wardlaw. The &#145;heresy&#146;, however, came in the mid-nineteenth century in a publication by Robert Chambers, <span class="italic">The Romantic Scottish Ballads: their Epoch and Authorship</span> (1849). Chambers asserts that there is no evidence for similar compositions before the eighteenth century&#151;that is, these are not old or minstrel productions; that structurally and stylistically these, and an array of other romantic ballads, are similar, sharing incidents and phrases and locales. And that, undoubtedly, the author or reviser is Lady Wardlaw, recognized already for the very similar &#145;Hardyknute&#146;. Norval Clyne took great exception to Chambers's heavily comparative, stylistic analyses, asserting that if Chambers is right:<blockquote>a number of Scottish Ballads, hitherto supposed to be the production of various unknown rhymers living at different periods and in different parts of the country, will have to be assigned to one Scottish lady who amused herself with verse-making, &#145;and cutting paper with her scissors&#146;. (Clyne, 5)</blockquote>This somewhat condescending put-down of Chambers, and of Lady Wardlaw who after all did successfully imitate structural and narrative aspects of traditional balladry, marked the end to extensive claims of authorship; but it did not obliterate the influence of &#145;Hardyknute&#146; on Sir Walter Scott, who claimed that it was the first poem he learned by heart and would be the last he'd forget, making Lady Wardlaw his literary foremother and muse.<br>
