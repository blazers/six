<span class="headword">Weston,  Stephen</span>  (1747&#150;1830), <span class="occ">antiquary and classical scholar</span>, was born in Exeter, the eldest son of Stephen Weston (<i>d</i>. 1750), registrar of Exeter diocese, and Elizabeth Oxenham of South Tawton, Devon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29132/', "Stephen Weston (1665&#150;1742)")</script>, bishop of Exeter, was his grandfather. According to the cathedral register Stephen was baptized in private on 8 June 1747 and received into the church at Exeter Cathedral on 10 July. He attended Blundell's School, Tiverton, and in 1759 entered Eton College, where he remained until 1763. His tutor, Mr Stinton, said, &#145;after overhawling him, that He found him an admirable Scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eglinton MSS</span>, 406). Weston matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 7 June 1764 and lived in college from 4 July 1764 to 7 July 1768. He graduated BA on 29 January 1768, MA on 14 November 1770, and BD on 2 May 1782, and was a Devonshire fellow from 1768 to 1784.<br>
<br>Weston accompanied Sir Charles Warwick Bampfylde of Devon as his tutor in a long tour of the continent. As a result of this tour he conceived a passion for travel and a particular love for France and, especially, for Paris. He was in Paris during the revolution of 1791 and 1792, but thought it expedient to leave the city rather than take unnecessary risks. His stay in Paris in 1791 and 1792 was marked by two anonymous publications, <span class="italic">Letters from Paris during the Summer of 1791</span> (1792) and <span class="italic">Letters from Paris during the Summer of 1792</span> (1793). He returned to Paris in 1802, and this visit too was celebrated by a publication, <span class="italic">The Praise of Paris: a Sketch of the French Capital in 1802</span> (1803). He began by writing, &#145;Paris is derived from Par Isis as this city was built near the famous statue of that goddess near St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s&#146;, prompting a contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> to write that although &#145;as an archaeologist he may have had something to learn, his little book is vividly written, and his descriptions as clean cut as a cameo&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 27). Not content with these, Weston wrote <span class="italic">A Slight Sketch of Paris in its Improved State since 1802: by a Visitor</span>, published in 1814, evidence of both another visit and a liking for familiar titles. Further indications of his love of the continent are other titles reflecting later visits to France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. In 1824 he published <span class="italic">The Englishman abroad, part i: Greece, Latium, Persia, and China; part ii: Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal</span>, which was something of a hotchpotch of prose and verse and translations.<br>
<br>On 29 March 1777, thanks to the nomination of Lord Lisburne, Weston was admitted to the rectory of Mamhead in Devon. Seven years later, on 17 January 1784, he obtained the rectory of Little Hempston in the same county, and he gave up his fellowship at Exeter College the same year, having married Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1789/90), youngest daughter of James Tierney, a commissioner of accounts, of Cleeve Hill in Mangotsfield parish, Gloucestershire. She died of consumption aged thirty-one at Caen in Normandy late in 1789 or early in 1790 and was embalmed and returned to Bristol, where she was buried in the family vault. Weston's anonymous translation <span class="italic">Turtle Dove</span>, from the French of Claris de Florian, was published in Caen in 1789. Late in 1790 he gave up the living of Mamhead, but he kept the benefice of Little Hempston until 1823. He lived for some years in London and had a varied acquaintance. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 1 March 1792, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 18 December 1794.<br>
<br>The first of some fifty published works by Weston, exclusive of those appearing in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and in the <span class="italic">Classical Journal</span>, was according to his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1830) <span class="italic">Hermesianax, sive, Conjecturae in Athenaeum &hellip;</span> (1784). He is thought to be the anonymous author of <span class="italic">Viaggiana: Remarks on the Buildings, &amp;c, of Rome</span> (1776; with another edition in 1790), a work not listed as his in the <span class="italic">British Library Catalogue of Printed Books</span>. The reviewer for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> concluded his remarks on <span class="italic">Hermesianax</span> by writing, &#145;We need not add, that a writer like this may justly be added with the Toups and Marklands of the age&#146;  (1784). Among Weston's many other works, other than travel literature, are translations from Chinese, Persian, and other languages, classical emendations, poems, biography, theological treatises, philological studies, and pieces on antiquarian subjects. Many of his works are of short compass, making understandable the great number of them. Thus, the reviewer of his <span class="italic">Conquest of the Miao-ts&eacute;; an Imperial Poem &hellip;</span> in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> could write:<blockquote>the appearance of the translation of another Chinese work; small, indeed, in point of bulk, and trifling in comparative importance, but more difficult in as much as poetry, in proportion as it becomes more concise and condensed, is more intricate and obscure than plain prose &hellip; we do not think that Mr. Weston has exercised much judgment in the choice of a subject for the employment of his talents; or that the results of his labours will prove eminently useful to the general cause of literature. (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 361)</blockquote>Taking into account his contributions to journals, there was virtually no year in the period of his life from 1783 until 1818 in which Weston did not have something published.<br>
<br>Weston's contributions to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> began in 1800 and were published almost yearly up to 1818, occasionally to the number of two or more in some years. So, too, with his letters to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, some twenty in number (there are three uncertain attributions), beginning in 1783 with a &#145;Query for explication of lines in &#147;Battle of Hastings&#148;&#146;, signed &#145;S. W.&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 53/1, 1783, 123), and ending in 1813 with the anonymous &#145;The tears of the booksellers&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 83/1, 1813, 160). The 1783 &#145;Query&#146; was answered by Thomas Holt White. Weston's letters are on a variety of subjects, with most dealing with classical literature and most carrying his initials, although he also employed some pseudonyms.<br>
<br>Weston was also a Shakespearian scholar, albeit a minor one. He contributed twenty-four notes on eighteen of Shakespeare's plays to the 1785 Shakespeare edition, edited by Isaac Reed. In the first sentence of his advertisement to his <span class="italic">Short Notes on Shakespeare, by Way of Supplement to Johnson, Steevens, Malone, and Douce</span> (1808) Weston states, mistakenly, that he had contributed to Steevens's 1793 Shakespeare. He wrote:<blockquote>Mr. Steevens having done me the honour to give a few notes of mine a place under the signature of S. W. among the chosen band of commentators in his very correct edition of Shakespeare, 1793, which I consider the temple of his fame; I venture to add a few more for the purpose of showing, among other things, how the antients and our own poet have thought, and express themselves alike, without imitation on the part of Shakespeare, most certainly, for whom they were not translated, and who had no power of reading the originals.</blockquote>On 7 July 1797 Steevens had successfully proposed Weston as a candidate for membership in The Club, and it may be that Weston wished, retrospectively, to link his name with Steevens's. There are sixty notes on many of the plays in the canon. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Weston was chary of emendations, both in the 1785 Shakespeare and in his <span class="italic">Short Notes</span>. Among other matters, his notes reflect his extensive travel on the continent, his intimate knowledge of the classics, and his eye for detail. Although one modern editor of Shakespeare's plays thought Weston's <span class="italic">Short Notes</span> of little value, they throw additional light on the extent of his widespread learning&#151;and on his need to associate himself with some of his better-known contemporaries. Most of Weston's library was sold by Robert Harding Evans of Pall Mall in 1827. Weston died in Edward Street, Portman Square, London, on 8 January 1830.<br>
