<span class="headword">Craddock, Sir  Reginald Henry</span>  (1864&#150;1937), <span class="occ">administrator in India and Burma</span>, was born at Dharmsala, Punjab, on 11 March 1864, the youngest son of Surgeon-Major William Craddock, of the Bengal medical service, and his wife, Mary Charlotte, daughter of Francis Spencer Hawkins. Craddock was sent to Britain for education at Wellington College. In 1882 he passed the open examination for the Indian Civil Service and in 1884, after two years' probation at Keble College, Oxford, was posted to the Central Provinces [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>].<br>
<br>Craddock was initially based at Jubbulpore. In December 1888, shortly after his marriage on 6 March that year to Frances Henrietta (1863/4&#150;1932), younger daughter of General Henry Ralph Browne, he was made assistant to the Nagpur commissioner of settlements and agriculture. From 1894 until 1901 he was intermittently seconded to the Central Provinces secretariat on revenue, agricultural, and famine duties, and in 1896&#150;7, and again in 1899&#150;1901, took charge of the province's famine operations. In May 1895 he became second secretary to the chief commissioner of the Central Provinces and, five years later, chief secretary. He attained the rank of commissioner in March 1902 and in May 1907 was appointed chief commissioner. He was made a CSI in 1902.<br>
<br>Throughout the Central Provinces Craddock was renowned for his devotion to duty. His command of the vernacular and understanding of agricultural life outstripped that of most of his colleagues, and to his junior officers he was the model of a paternalistic ruler: benign and pragmatic, but firm. A conservative, Craddock saw himself as the defender of the peasant's traditions and rights against a rising tide of self-interested, Western-style nationalist agitation.<br>
<br>In 1911 Craddock was appointed KCSI and in March 1912 he became home member of the government of India under Lord Hardinge. Confronted with terrorism in Bengal and the widespread home-rule agitation of the war years his conservatism became more marked. He recognized no distinctions between moderates and extremists, and classified all critics of the government as fundamentally disloyal. In opposition to the liberal counsels of Lord Carmichael, governor of Bengal, he advocated suppression of political dissent and, after the war, sought to have the repressive provisions of the <span class="roman">Defence of India Act</span> preserved in peacetime legislation. The draconian and inflammatory Rowlatt bills were the ideological hangover of his time as home member.<br>
<br>In 1917 Craddock was appointed lieutenant-governor of Burma, but he was appalled to discover that there too nationalism had taken root. In contrast to the government of India's softly-softly approach to Gandhi's non-co-operation movement of 1920&#150;22, in Burma Craddock cracked down hard. Bowing to the inevitability of local self-government, he devised a scheme of political reform which, in its niggardliness, reflected his view of the Burmese as the &#145;spoilt children of the East&#146;&#151;charming but entirely unfit for government. To his dismay, his scheme was jettisoned in favour of a version of the diarchy introduced in India under the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms. Fortunately, perhaps, Craddock left Burma in 1922, just before the reforms came into force.<br>
<br>Craddock retired in 1923 and was appointed GCIE. Back in London he became chairman of the Indian Civil Service (Retired) Association and in 1923&#150;4 served as a member of the royal commission into the superior civil services in India. In 1929, when the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms were due for review, he published <span class="italic">The Dilemma in India</span> in which he derided the notion of Indian nationality and advocated an extension of electoral constituencies based on class, religion, and profession rather than territory. In 1931 he entered parliament as a Conservative member for the Combined English Universities. An obvious choice to sit on the joint select committee on Indian reforms, he was an outspoken, although cordial, opponent of further moves towards self-government in India.<br>
<br>Craddock died on 10 February 1937 at the Empire Nursing Home in Westminster, where he had been recovering from an operation. On 13 February his remains were cremated at Golders Green crematorium. His wife, Frances, who was made a CBE in 1919, had died in 1932 and Craddock was survived by a son and two daughters.<br>
