<span class="headword">Phillips,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1633), <span class="occ">bishop of Sodor and Man</span>, was born in Wales, although the exact date and location and the names of his parents are unknown. He was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, graduating BA on 19 May 1579 and proceeding MA on 25 May 1584. He was appointed rector of Sessay in the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1579, and four years later to the living of Thorpe Bassett, in the East Riding. By 1585 he had come to the attention of Henry Stanley, fourth earl of Derby, acting as chaplain to the earl when he went to France as ambassador early that year. Two years later, no doubt through Stanley patronage, he was appointed archdeacon of Man, and also rector of Andreas, on the northern point of the island. By 1588 he had married (his wife's name is unknown). In 1591 he added to his Yorkshire benefices the rectory of Slingsby, in the North Riding. In 1597 he is recorded as attending the Manx convocation. On 25 April 1601 he was installed archdeacon of Cleveland in the diocese of York.<br>
<br>When George Lloyd was translated to the diocese of Chester late in 1604, Phillips succeeded him as bishop of Sodor and Man: he was nominated by James I (Man being then under crown control) on 29 January 1605 and consecrated on 10 February following. That same year he was made DTh. The income from the bishopric was at the low end of the scale, valued at &pound;140&#150;&pound;150, but was improvable by fines when leases fell due. He retained the archdeaconry of Man <i>in commendam</i> as well as most of his other preferments. A pointer to his religious position is his association with the godly Hoby family of Hackness, about 12&frac12; miles from Thorpe Bassett. Lady Hoby recorded hearing Phillips preach three times in September 1603, noting on the last of these occasions that he was accompanied by his wife. He also conducted ordinations, to the displeasure of Archbishop Toby Matthew, who in 1612 inhibited him from conducting more such ceremonies in the diocese of York, perhaps because Phillips was less particular about ordaining non-graduates than Matthew liked. In 1605 he resigned Thorpe Bassett, but Lord Derby compensated by presenting him to the Welsh rectory of Hawarden which he retained until his death. In 1614 the countess of Derby appointed him a commissioner to act against islanders involved in piracy. He later gave up Slingsby, where he was succeeded in January 1619 by his son Samuel, and also the same year the archdeaconry of Cleveland.<br>
<br>As bishop of Man Phillips acquired a good reputation for his administration, but there was inevitable resistance to change among his clergy and a strong insularity against outsiders, especially Welshmen. Of the seventeen Manx parishes he had the right of appointment to only three, the remainder being under the control of the earl. No copy of the articles survives from his first visitation in the autumn of 1605. He made some progress in 1606 in recovering episcopal estates whose leases had terminated, but was forced to appeal to Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, for help in defending his rights against an unjust petition lodged against him with the privy council. He complained that one of the petitioners had &#145;obtained more than three quarters of the Bishopric by leases in reversion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 24.98). The council acted to protect his interests. He had learned the Manx language &#145;so exactly that he ordinarily did preach in it&#146;  (Moore, 140), a knowledge he used in 1610 to complete &#145;The Mannish Book of Common Prayer by me translated&#146;. At the convocation that year he submitted his translation for consideration by the clergy. A number of needed reforms were pushed through in the convocation of 1610. Among others a set of ecclesiastical laws which had existed only in oral tradition was committed to writing. (One unusual piece of legislation which illustrates the survival of pre-Reformation customs was one legitimizing the children of the clergy.)<br>
<br>Phillips's reforms faced firm opposition from the clergy as well as interference from the governor, John Ireland, who held full authority from Derby in his absence. Ireland, whose leanings were towards nonconformity, informed Phillips that &#145;being a Welshman, he could never do any good&#146;. Among other disagreements the bishop charged that Ireland appointed a &#145;layman in the chaplain's place to read service to the garrison in a scandalous manner, viz. in his doblett and hose, and sometime in his livery coat; yea, when a minister or two have been present&#146;. The controversy came to a head on the question whether the garrison was under the bishop's spiritual jurisdiction. Ireland, blocking an appeal to higher authority, denied the bishop a passport to England: his friends &#145;were obliged to forbare his house and his company for fear of the governor&#146;. Ultimately Phillips lost the contest.<br>
<br>Phillips's version of the prayer book faced strong objections from the island's clergy who were accustomed to using extemporaneous translations of the prayers and lessons in public worship. The printing of it was dropped, and the 1765 translation by his successor, Mark Hildesley, made no use of Phillips's manuscript. Phillips's version was finally published by the Manx Society in two volumes in 1895. One of the editors described the translation as simple and direct, and noted that it was &#145;for the most part, easily understood by those who speak Manx at the present day&#146;  (Moore, 136).<br>
<br>The claim that Phillips also translated the entire <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Manx is dubious. The main evidence comes from James Chaloner, governor of Man, who in 1658 gave Hugh Cannell, vicar of St Michael, a supplement of &pound;14 to his stipend because he had assisted the bishop for twenty-nine years in the work of translating the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Phillips died on 7 August 1633 at Bishop's Court in the parish of Ballaugh and was buried in St German's Cathedral, Peel. A later bishop, Richard Parr, who died in 1643, is supposed to have been buried in the same grave, but the site is unknown. No monument exists but a fitting epitaph is provided by William Sacheverell, who declared that Phillips was &#145;famous for his Charity and Hospitality&#146;  (Willis, 2.368).<br>
