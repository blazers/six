<span class="headword">Loingsech mac &Oacute;enguso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 704), <span class="occ">high-king of Ireland</span>, was also king of Cen&eacute;l Conaill. He succeeded F&iacute;nsnechtae Fledach mac D&uacute;nchada (<i>d</i>. 695) as high-king in 696 and reigned as such until his death. Loingsech was the first Cen&eacute;l Conaill ruler to become king of Tara (high-king) in almost fifty years; the previous four kings to have attained to this position of overking of all the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and their dependencies belonged to S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine, a branch of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in whose territory the iconic site of Tara lay. The annalistic sources contain only two entries on Loingsech. The first is a bare notice of the year of his accession. The second is unusually precise: it states that he died in the battle of Corann (in south Sligo) and that this occurred on the fourth of the ides of July (12 July), at the sixth hour, on a Saturday.<br>
<br>Loingsech was fifth cousin to Adomn&aacute;n, who had been abbot of Iona, and therefore head of the Columban <i>paruchia</i>, since 679. The fact that these Cen&eacute;l Conaill cousins led the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and the powerful Columban federation in the years 696&#150;704 reinforced the prestige and power of both men. Throughout the seventh century, there was strong rivalry for ecclesiastical primacy between the various Irish <i>paruchiae</i>. From the middle of the century onwards the church of Armagh, situated in the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill vassal territory of Airthir, offered a series of challenges to the Columban <i>paruchia</i>, by promoting the cult of Patrick and by centring the cult on Armagh itself. The U&iacute; N&eacute;ill's traditional allegiance, however, was to the founder saint of the Columban churches; and his successor, Adomn&aacute;n, had brought this <i>paruchia</i> to the peak of its power at the end of the seventh century. When the kingship of Tara returned to Cen&eacute;l Conaill in the person of Loingsech, Adomn&aacute;n was afforded his strongest chance of reasserting the primacy of the Columban federation. There is diplomatic evidence that Loingsech and Adomn&aacute;n co-operated in at least one major enterprise: Loingsech's name appears first on the list of secular rulers who gave their support to the <span class="italic">Lex Innocentium</span>, a law promulgated by Adomn&aacute;n in 697 <i>in</i> <i>Hibernia</i> <i>Britaniaque</i> (&#145;in Ireland and Britain&#146;), to which the church of Armagh gave its support.<br>
<br>Adomn&aacute;n aspired to establish a Christian high-kingship but while he promoted the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill as the supreme federation, the high-kingship did not become a hegemony enforced by military power until after the mid-ninth century. Nevertheless, Loingsech, and his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50104/', "Domnall mac &#193;eda")</script>, are given the title <i>rex</i> <i>Hiberniae</i> (&#145;king of Ireland&#146;) by the original hand of the annals of Ulster, the only two pre-ninth century kings so designated. As the annals before <i>c</i>.740 are based on a chronicle compiled at Iona, the designation can be taken to reflect Adomn&aacute;n's concept of Christian <i>imperium</i>.<br>
<br>However, it is possible that Loingsech, as king of Tara, was attempting to assert a claim to the high-kingship at the time of his death at the battle of Corann. In leading an army southwards into Connacht, his first aim probably was territorial expansion: Cen&eacute;l Conaill's opportunity for eastward expansion had diminished as a result of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain aggrandizement. But Loingsech may also have hoped to deal a major blow to Connacht's ascendant dynasty, U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute;, and thereby gain the submission of the province: the accounts in the secondary hand of the annals of Ulster, in the interpolated annals, and in the narrative tale of the battle attribute the victory to Cellach mac Ragallaig, the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute; king.<br>
<br>Cen&eacute;l Conaill rulers occupied the kingship of Tara only twice more after Loingsech's death. The first of these was Loingsech's immediate successor and first cousin, Congal mac Ferguso (<i>r</i>. 704&#150;10). The second was Loingsech's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50116/', "Flaithbertach mac Loingsig")</script>, who began his rule in 728, was deposed in 734, and died in 765. It is therefore unlikely that Loingsech was over forty years of age at his own death.<br>
