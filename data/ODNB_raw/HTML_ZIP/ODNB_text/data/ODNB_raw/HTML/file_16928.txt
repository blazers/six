<span class="headword">Loewe,  Louis</span>  (1809&#150;1888), <span class="occ">linguist</span>, was born of Jewish parents at Z&uuml;lz, Prussian Silesia. After attending successively Rosenburg Academy and the colleges of Leszno, Nikolsburg (Mikulov), and Bratislava, studying theology, oriental languages, and the sciences, he matriculated at the University of Berlin, where he took the degree of PhD. His knowledge of languages and numismatics was already considerable, and on a visit to Hamburg he was entrusted with arranging the oriental coins in the Sprewitz collection. On arrival in London, he obtained introductions to the duke of Sussex and Admiral Sir Sydney Smith, through whom he became known to many leading scholars and patrons of learning in England. Pursuing his researches Loewe subsequently visited Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris. In 1836 he undertook, under the auspices of the duke of Sussex and Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, a three-year tour in the East for the purpose of extending his knowledge of such languages as Arabic, Coptic, Nubian, Turkish, and Circassian. Near Safed he was ill-treated and robbed by some Druses, and had to continue his journey through Palestine dressed as a Bedouin. In 1839 the duke of Sussex appointed him his lecturer on oriental languages.<br>
<br>On his return from his travels in 1839 Loewe went to study in the Vatican Library. At this time Sir Moses Montefiore passed through Rome on his second journey to the Holy Land, and Loewe, who had been Montefiore's guest at Ramsgate in 1835, readily accepted his invitation to accompany him to Palestine as his secretary. This close relationship with Sir Moses ceased only at the latter's death, and some regarded Loewe as &#145;the power behind the throne&#146;  (Morais, 208). In the memorable mission to Damascus and Constantinople in 1840, and on the thirteen succeeding journeys, extending from 1839 to 1874, Loewe accompanied Montefiore, to whom his linguistic acquirements and shrewd sense proved invaluable. In 1840 he addressed a large mixed congregation in the synagogue at Galata in four languages. His services to the missions and philanthropic schemes of Montefiore were frequently acknowledged by the Jewish board of deputies. On 25 March 1841 he was presented by Montefiore to Queen Victoria. He married in 1844.<br>
<br>In 1846 Loewe delivered two lectures on the Samaritans at Sussex Hall, Leadenhall Street, and in the same year he preached in the great synagogue at Vilna, on the occasion of Montefiore's mission to Russia. He was appointed first principal of Jews' College, Finsbury Square, in 1856, but soon resigned the office. He became examiner for oriental languages to the Royal College of Preceptors in 1858, and in the same year opened a Jewish boarding-school at Brighton. His advertisement in the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> offered Hindustani and fencing, and the assurance that &#145;the pupils are permitted to write to their Parents or Guardians once a week, and their letters are NOT examined&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Jewish Chronicle, 1841&#150;1941</span>, 39). He was naturalized on 12 July 1862. When in 1868 Montefiore founded the Judith Theological College at Ramsgate, he chose Loewe as principal and director, and Loewe filled that office for twenty years.<br>
<br>Sir Moses Montefiore by his will named Loewe one of his executors and entrusted him with all his diaries and other private papers to enable him to write a biography of Lady Montefiore. This became a biography of Sir Moses also, and an oblique record of Loewe's own work and travels. It was completed in June 1888, and published as <span class="italic">Diaries of Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore</span>, edited by Dr L. Loewe, 2 vols. (1890).<br>
<br>In 1841 Loewe prepared an English translation of J. B. Levinsohn's <span class="italic">Ef&eacute;s Damm&icirc;m</span> (1839), a series of conversations at Jerusalem between a Greek patriarch and a chief rabbi regarding the revival of the blood accusation in Soslow, Poland. In 1842 Loewe translated the first two conversations in <span class="italic">Matteh Dan</span> by Chacham David Nieto, as <span class="italic">The Rod of Judgment</span>. He also published <span class="italic">Observations on a unique Cufic gold coin, issued by Mustali, tenth caliph of the Fatimite dynasty</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Circassian Language</span> (1854), originally printed in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Philological Society</span>.<br>
<br>Loewe was a member of the Royal Asiatic and Numismatic societies, and of the Asiatic Society of Paris. He was a quiet, laborious scholar, with an aversion to public life and, except to those who knew him well, could seem cold and unsympathetic. Early in 1888 he moved to London where he died on 5 November 1888 at 53 Warwick Road, Maida Vale, leaving his wife, Emma, three sons and four daughters. He was buried at Willesden.<br>
