<span class="headword">Stennett,  Joseph</span>  (1663&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Seventh Day Baptist minister</span>, was born at Abingdon, Berkshire, the third (but second surviving) son of eight children of Edward Stennett (1627/8&#150;1705), physician, and his wife, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1626?), who was probably the daughter of Richard Quelch of the parish of St Michael-at-the-Northgate, Oxford. His father, of a Lincolnshire family, had belonged to the Fifth Monarchist John Pendarves's Baptist congregation at Abingdon and adopted sabbatarian views during the 1650s. He moved from Abingdon to Wallingford in 1670 or 1671 and led a Seventh Day Baptist congregation at Wallingford for many years. Joseph was educated at Wallingford grammar school and also by his father and by his elder brother, Jehudah, who wrote and published a Hebrew grammar in 1685. He became proficient in several languages, ancient and modern. In 1685 he settled in London as a schoolmaster and on 27 November 1686 joined the Seventh Day Baptist congregation at Pinners' Hall, Old Broad Street, where his father assisted in the ministry. He was sometime evening lecturer to the Seventh Day Baptist congregation at Devonshire Square, London, and on 4 March 1690 he was ordained pastor at Pinners' Hall. For a period he was Sunday lecturer to the General Baptist congregation at Paul's Alley, Barbican, where in 1700 his hearers protested against his Calvinist preaching.<br>
<br>On several public occasions Stennett was the trusted representative of the whole body of Baptists. In 1704 the Baptists in London invited him to compile a history of Baptists; he collected much material but the project did not come to fruition. A conscientious pastor and fluent preacher with a low, musical voice, his sermon celebrating the victory at Blenheim found favour with Queen Anne. Nahum Tate, the poet laureate, and Mordecai Abbot were among his friends. His <span class="italic">Works</span>, published posthumously in 1732, mainly consists of sermons, but also hymns and poetry. Not included are <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr David Russen</span> (1704) and several translations from the French. He printed anonymously political satires in verse; some are said to be in the <span class="italic">Poems on State Affairs</span>.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1688 Stennett married Susanna, younger daughter of George Guill (or Gill), a refugee Huguenot merchant, and so became brother-in-law to Daniel Williams, Presbyterian minister and founder of the library now in Gordon Square, London, who married Susanna's widowed sister, Jane Barkstead, in 1701. Stennett died on 11 July 1713 at the home of his brother-in-law William Morton, at Knaphill, Buckinghamshire, and was buried in Hughenden churchyard, where his tombstone bears a Latin inscription by John Ward. He was survived by his wife and four of their children, the eldest of whom was <a name="cosubject_26361"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Stennett</span>  (1692&#150;1758), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, who was born in London on 6 November 1692. Educated by Dr Robert Ainsworth and Dr John Ward at Gresham College, he ministered to Baptists at Abergavenny and Leominster (1714&#150;18), Exeter (1719&#150;37), and Little Wild Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields (1737&#150;58), while being sabbatarian in private practice. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 he was the author of a loyal address, and in 1754 he was made a DD of Edinburgh University at the instigation of the duke of Cumberland.<br>
<br>In 1714 Stennett married Rebekah (Rebecca) Davies (<i>d</i>. 1744), whose father, Nathaniel Morgan, was a Baptist preacher living at that time in Usk Castle. She died in 1744, having borne eleven children in thirteen years, of whom five survived her. She was buried in Bunhill Fields. On 25 April 1750, in the parish of All Hallows London Wall, Stennett married Elizabeth Haley (<i>d</i>. 1771). He was assisted at Little Wild Street by his sons Joseph and Samuel. In 1750 he was a founder member of the non-denominational Society for Religious Knowledge among the Poor. He published fourteen sermons. He died in Bath on 7 February 1758 and was succeeded as pastor by his son <a name="cosubject_26362"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Stennett</span>  (1727&#150;1795), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, who was born at his parents' home in Exeter on 1 June 1727. He was educated by John Hubbard of Stepney and John Walker of Mile End Academy, and on 1 April 1763 he was made DD by King's College, Aberdeen. He was a man of broad views and considerable public influence; the philanthropist John Howard attended his church when in London. Sabbatarian in personal devotion, he also took morning service at Cripplegate Seventh Day Baptist Church, which had once been his grandfather's congregation, having migrated from Pinners' Hall. He was assisted by his son Joseph, the fifth in a succession of ministers from father to son. On 20 March 1750 he married Elizabeth Marsom (1723/4&#150;1795), daughter of Samuel Marsom, a Baptist minister in Luton, Bedfordshire. They had at least three children: Haley, Joseph (who also became a minister), and Elizabeth. Shortly after the death of his adored wife, he died at Muswell Hill on 24 August 1795 and was buried in Bunhill Fields. His works, chiefly sermons, were collected in three volumes in 1824 by William Jones, with a memoir appended. His hymns, rarely found in modern collections, are thought not equal to those of his grandfather.<br>
