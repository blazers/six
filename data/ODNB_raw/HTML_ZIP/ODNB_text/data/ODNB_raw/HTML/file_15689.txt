<span class="headword">Kitchin,  Anthony</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Dunstan]</span>  (1477&#150;1563), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was of unknown parentage and origins. He entered Westminster Abbey as a mature vocation in 1511 and celebrated his first mass in 1517, by when he was studying at Gloucester College, Oxford. He was admitted BTh in 1525 and the following year was appointed prior of students, a post that involved supervising Benedictine students outside as well as within the loose federation of &#145;staircases&#146; which made up the Benedictine Gloucester College. In 1532 he became abbot of Eynsham, near Oxford, and in 1538, shortly before the dissolution of his abbey, he proceeded DTh. He does not appear to have been a very active abbot. In September 1535 the king's visitor, John Tregonwell, reported of Eynsham that &#145;The abbot is chaste in his living; looks well to the reparation of the house; but he is negligent in overseeing his brethren, which he excuses by his daily infirmity&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 9, no. 457). He took the line of least resistance in the political and theological controversies of the 1530s, subscribing the royal supremacy in 1534 and the articles of religion in 1536. About the beginning of 1537 John Perkins, an Oxford lawyer who seems to have become mentally disturbed, brought a series of vague accusations of treason against Kitchin and the abbot of Osney, but these were speedily dismissed. Kitchin surrendered his abbey on 4 December 1538, receiving a pension of &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. and an appointment as royal chaplain-in-ordinary. In 1545 he replaced Robert Holgate as bishop of Llandaff: he was to be the first resident bishop the diocese had had for over a century.<br>
<br>The diocese was not (as a later bishop, Francis Godwin, claimed) one of the wealthiest in the land; it was in fact the second poorest. Kitchin thus gave up his pension for a diocese whose total income was only a little larger: and he was virtually unique among bishops of Llandaff before the nineteenth century in that he held no other preferments. The accusations (notably by Godwin) that he ruined the diocese by incompetent management also need to be treated with scepticism. In spite of considerable pressure, in effect he alienated no land outright, though he was forced to make several long leases and grants in perpetuity, including one of the manor of Llandaff to the Matthews family in 1553. His lease of the episcopal palace and manor of Matharn to William Lewis of St Pierre is best interpreted as a collusive grant to keep the lands out of other hands. Even so, in the early 1590s he was criticized by Gervase Babington with rueful humour in the comment that he was now bishop only of &#145;Aff&#146;, for all the land had gone.<br>
<br>A more serious criticism is Kitchin's compliance in accepting a series of radical religious changes. He was prepared to oppose government policy, notably in his opposition to clerical marriage in 1549, but he never pushed his arguments so far that he could be removed from office. In 1554, again, he took his own line when, on the reconciliation of the kingdom with Rome, he was the only bishop not to seek absolution from the sin of schism. If he did not consider himself a schismatic, he may also have felt that he had protected his diocese from sin. Clearly a most reluctant persecutor, he showed his compassion in his efforts to persuade Rawlins White, presented by John Foxe as no more than a Cardiff fisherman but probably the leader of a group of local heretics, to save his life by recanting, and persevered in them up to the moment when White went to the stake in March 1555.<br>
<br>In 1559, along with the other Marian bishops, Kitchin voted in the Lords against the restoration of the royal supremacy and the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. Elizabeth succeeded in removing the other intransigents. Kitchin could not be removed, but he was eventually outnumbered. Characteristically, he backed down rather than fight and be defeated. His refusal to take the oath of supremacy nearly cost him his diocese in 1559, but he eventually accepted a curiously worded compromise. He was also allowed to refuse Elizabeth's mandate to consecrate Matthew Parker as archbishop of Canterbury, a refusal that has subsequently called into question the validity of all Anglican orders. J. C. Whitebrook's theory that Kitchin did in fact consecrate Parker in a private ceremony is almost certainly fantasy.<br>
<br>The extent of Kitchin's success as a pastoral bishop, and the justification for his sacrifice of principle, is seen in the condition of his diocese at the time of his death. The survey of the clergy in the winter of 1560&#150;61 showed many gaps in the parochial ministry, caused partly by the slump in clerical recruitment and the devastating effects of the influenza epidemics of the late 1550s and partly by absenteeism. By 1563, however, the situation had improved considerably. Few parishes were without incumbents, though there was still much pluralism; several absentees had been persuaded to return; and there had been a marked upturn in recruitment.<br>
<br>Kitchin was now eighty-six. He had been blind for some years and was too ill to attend the parliament of 1562. He died at his palace at Matharn on 31 October 1563 and was buried in the parish church: no monument survives. Nor has his will survived, though there are references to it in other documents. An inventory of the contents of his palace lists property worth &pound;109. It makes pathetic reading: some old clothes and furnishings (possibly bought when he left the religious life); a little silver and gilt plate; forty books (alas, no details); and a well-equipped kitchen, suggesting that he was fulfilling another pastoral obligation, that of hospitality.<br>
