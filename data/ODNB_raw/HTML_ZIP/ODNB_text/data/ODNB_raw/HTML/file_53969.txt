<span class="headword">Hull,  Edward</span>  (1829&#150;1917), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in Antrim town on 21 May 1829, the eldest son of the Revd John Dawson Hull (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1886). He attended schools in Edgeworthstown, co. Longford, and Lucan, co. Dublin. In April 1846 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, from where he was awarded a diploma in engineering in 1849, a BA in 1850, and a master's degree in engineering in 1871. He joined the Geological Survey of Great Britain under Sir Henry Thomas De la Beche (1796&#150;1855) on 1 April 1850, and was trained in north Wales by Joseph Beete Jukes (1811&#150;1869). His early survey duties took him into Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire, while between 1860 and 1867 he was responsible for mapping the south Lancashire coalfield. On 4 August 1857 he married Mary Catherine Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of Charles Turner Cooke of Cheltenham. They had two sons and four daughters, one of whom was Eleanor Hull (1860&#150;1935), historian and founder of the Irish Texts Society.<br>
<br>Some of Hull's early mapping was adjudged to be grossly inadequate, and about 1854 he came close to dismissal. However, his work improved somewhat and his career began to prosper when Sir Roderick Impey Murchison (1792&#150;1871) succeeded De la Beche as director in 1855. Hull's cousin was married to Murchison's sister. When the geological survey of Scotland was organized in 1867, Hull became its district surveyor under Archibald Geikie (1835&#150;1924), and he mapped in the Lanarkshire coalfield. In April 1869 Murchison sent him to Dublin to take charge of the Irish survey during the illness of Jukes, who was now that survey's director. Following Jukes's death, Hull became the Irish director in October 1869.<br>
<br>In Ireland, Hull persisted with the sound methods devised by Jukes, and between 1869 and 1890 he supervised the preparation of the eighty-five sheets necessary to complete the survey's one-inch geological map of Ireland. For this achievement he deserves great credit (he himself had hoped for a knighthood), but many of his numerous personal publications are marred by superficiality in field examination and by sweeping generalization. For far too long he clung to belief in a glacial submergence, he sought to impose a tripartite division upon the Pleistocene deposits of Britain and Ireland, and in the south of Ireland he thought he had found solutions to problems which for long had baffled far more talented geologists. His survey revision of the geology of southern Ireland (1878&#150;81) was a disaster which later had to be expunged from the one-inch sheets involved. Among Hull's many books the three most significant are, arguably, <span class="italic">The Coal-Fields of Great Britain</span> (five edns 1861 to 1905), <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Building and Ornamental Stones of Great Britain and Foreign Countries</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">Contributions to the Physical History of the British Isles</span> (1882), the last of which pioneered the genre of the palaeogeographical atlas.<br>
<br>While Irish director, Hull sometimes obtained permission to act as a private consultant, and in this capacity he visited Hungary in 1873 and the USA in 1890. In 1883&#150;4 he led an expedition to the Wadi Araba on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund, with Horatio Herbert Kitchener as a member of his party. Hull was elected to the Royal Society in June 1867, was professor of geology in the Royal College of Science for Ireland in 1869&#150;90, and president of the Royal Geological Society of Ireland (1873&#150;5), but he was never elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He received an honorary LLD from the University of Glasgow in 1879, and the Murchison medal of the Geological Society of London in 1890.<br>
<br>Hull retired from the survey on 30 September 1890. The following year he left Dublin to live in London, where he served as a consultant, mostly in the area of water-supply, and engaged himself in the affairs of the Victoria Institute. He died of bronchitis at his home, 14 Stanley Gardens, Kensington, London, on 18 October 1917. A hard-working man of shallow intellect, who was often the butt of his colleagues' ridicule, Hull's years in Dublin were sullied by his notorious feud with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34316/', "George Henry Kinahan (1829&#150;1908)")</script>, the survey's district surveyor. Kinahan believed himself to have been Jukes's rightful successor as director, and Hull's fussiness and petulance in the position only served to exacerbate the situation.<br>
