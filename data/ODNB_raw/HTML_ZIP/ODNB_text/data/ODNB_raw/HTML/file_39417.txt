<span class="headword">Tobin, Sir  John</span>  (1763&#150;1851), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on the Isle of Man, the eldest son of Patrick Tobin (1735&#150;1794), merchant. His family came originally from Dublin, but had lived on the Isle of Man since 1728. He began his career as a merchant seaman sailing from Liverpool, and by the 1790s was a master, operating in the slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean. During the early years of the war with France he was a highly successful privateer, capturing several French slaving ships.<br>
<br>In 1798 Tobin married Sarah Aspinall (1770&#150;1853), daughter of James Aspinall (1729&#150;1787), a prominent Liverpool slave trader. They had eight children&#151;five daughters and three sons, of whom three daughters and one son survived Tobin. This marriage may have brought him capital, for by 1799 he was trading on his own account, as John Tobin &amp; Co., and by 1803 he had left the sea and settled in Liverpool. The abolition of the British slave trade in 1807 proved to be the making of his business for he was to be one of the pioneers of the trade in &#145;legitimate&#146; products between west Africa and Britain, particularly in palm oil for industrial and railway lubrication and for the manufacture of soap and candles. His success lay in his development of the trade from Calabar, the centre of the palm-oil trade in these years, and his close ties with the ruling &eacute;lite in that state. The rapid increase in the trade in the 1810s and 1820s made his fortune as well as that of his brother Thomas; by the early 1830s he was probably the largest African trader in Britain.<br>
<br>His success in the African trade allowed Tobin to pursue an active political career. He was one of the leading tories in Liverpool, a friend of George Canning and William Huskisson, and closely connected to the Gladstone family. With John Gladstone MP he was a prominent member of a local committee set up to defend the crown and constitution in the troubled climate of 1819. In the same year he stood for election as mayor of Liverpool and was elected in what his political opponents described as one of &#145;the most barefaced acts of bribery that ever disgraced even the electioneering annals of this venal rotten borough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span>, 22 Oct 1819). He received a knighthood in May 1820 on the accession of George IV. He remained a member of Liverpool common council for many years and was at the centre of a network of tory and African trading interests on it.<br>
<br>Tobin's business interests covered a variety of spheres. During the early 1820s he was involved in promoting a railway between Liverpool and Manchester and in 1838 was one of the directors that formed the Transatlantic Steam Company, operating between Liverpool and New York. In 1837 he built the <i>Liverpool</i> (1150 tons), at that time the largest steamship launched on Mersyside, for the transatlantic run. His ships were also to be found trading to India for cloth and to the West Indies for sugar, tobacco, and rum, all items needed for the African trade. By the 1830s he had moved into insurance broking. He also became involved in land speculation on Merseyside in the late 1820s, purchasing land in Wallasey with William Laird, which shortly afterwards was bought by the Liverpool council, netting him a substantial profit.<br>
<br>In 1819 Tobin purchased Oak Hill House, Old Swan, Liverpool, and lived there until 1835, when he built Liscard Hall on land he had bought in Wallasey. He retired from the African trade shortly after 1840 and died, at Liscard Hall, on 27 February 1851. He was buried at St John's Church, Egremont, Wallasey.<br>
