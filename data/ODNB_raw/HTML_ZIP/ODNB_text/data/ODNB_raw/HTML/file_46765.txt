<span class="headword">Cadogan,  William Bromley</span>  (1751&#150;1797), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was born on 22 January 1751 in Bruton Street, London, the second son of Charles Sloane Cadogan, third Earl Cadogan (1728&#150;1807), landowner, and his first wife, Frances Bromley (<i>d</i>. 1768), the only daughter of Henry Bromley, first Baron Montford. He began his education at Westminster School, then matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1769, whence he proceeded BA in 1773 and MA in 1776. Henry Bathurst, later second Earl Bathurst, who was at the time lord chancellor, presented him to the vicarage of St Giles, Reading, in 1774, when the previous evangelical vicar, William Talbot, died. Cadogan was then collated to the rectory of Chelsea in 1775, which was in his father's gift. In 1782 he married Mrs Bradshaw, formerly Graham (<i>d</i>. 1827), the widow of Captain Bradshaw, private secretary and aide-de-camp to General Vaughan. From his letters to her, it appears that their marriage was a happy one&#151;he always addressed her as &#145;my dear life&#146;; they had no children.<br>
<br>When Cadogan first arrived in the parish of St Giles, he had the reputation of being a haughty pastor and a stern opponent of Methodism; he threatened to sue proprietors who opened for business on Sundays, he dismissed his evangelical curate, and he castigated his parishioners for going to hear Methodist preachers. He proved, however, to be an attentive pastor and an earnest seeker of truth. John Wesley heard of his zeal, and sent him a set of his writings, but Cadogan responded by burning the books in his own kitchen, because he vowed that he would learn the truth from scripture alone. Some time during the first few years of his tenure at Reading, he fell under the influence of Mrs Talbot, the late vicar's wife. The Talbots had been close friends of the evangelical Calvinist William Romaine, rector of St Ann Blackfriars, and Romaine was careful to keep in touch with Mrs Talbot after her husband's death. Cadogan acknowledged her influence on him when he preached at her funeral in 1785. She was, he said, not only &#145;the best friend I ever had in my life, but &hellip; a Mother to me in love, in every good office, and in continual prayers for my person and ministry&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Love of Christ the Portion and Principle of the Children of God</span>, 1785, 6). Largely because of her encouragement and through his subsequent contact with William Romaine, Cadogan developed an evangelical fervour in his ministry. He offered to reinstate his old curate, who, however, declined, and began preaching extemporaneously on &#145;experimental&#146; religion. By taking such an evangelical stand, he seems to have forfeited further preferment, despite the fact that he was respected by and an intimate of Robert Lowth, the bishop of London. He became very popular in Reading and Chelsea on account of his preaching and his cure of souls: his biographer, Richard Cecil, reported that he attracted large crowds to his services and that he garnered much respect because of his diligent care for his parishioners and his charity and benevolence to all.<br>
<br>Cadogan was, according to Cecil, a high-churchman and a Calvinist. He never could appreciate Wesley's Arminianism, which he complained was a system that was &#145;founded in ignorance, supported by pride&#146; and would &#145;end in delusion&#146;  (Rogal). Although he resisted Wesley's influence, Romaine's influence was evidently potent: Cadogan remained very close to the rector of St Anne's for the rest of the latter's life. Romaine's letters indicate that he often went to Reading, and that he gave a Thursday evening lecture there with some regularity. Cadogan often officiated in Romaine's parish; he preached the funeral sermon when the latter died in 1795, and wrote a short biography of the rector, published in 1796. He had other evangelical friends&#151;his letters indicate that he was well known to John Newton and Richard Cecil, and that he occasionally preached in the latter's parish&#151;but none was as close as Romaine.<br>
<br>Cadogan published a number of individual sermons as well as collections of his works which demonstrate the attractive nature of his theology and the power of his preaching. In <span class="italic">Liberty and Equality: Two Sermons</span> (1792), for example, he gushes with emotion about the joy of salvation: true believers<blockquote>shall be ranging at large in the bright regions of eternal day, they shall be singing hallelujahs to the Lord God omnipotent, and rejoicing in Him who hath saved them with an everlasting salvation: in a word, for ever released from shame and sorrow, and for ever crowned with glory and righteousness, they are &#145;free indeed&#146;. (pp. 25&#150;6)</blockquote>His florid language led the reviewer in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> to call these two sermons &#145;nothing more nor less than the ranting effusions of methodistical orthodoxy&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 63/1, 1793, 246). He produced a hymnal in a style very similar to that of his friend John Newton, entitled <span class="italic">Psalms and Hymns Collected by W. B. Cadogan</span> (1785), which was reprinted in 1787, 1793, and 1803. It was divided into two parts, as indicated by the title&#151;psalms put to metre and hymns&#151;and was full of effusive praise.<br>
<br>Cadogan died in Reading on 18 January 1797, aged forty-five, and was buried at St Giles's, Reading. A monument was erected to him in St Giles's, on which his &#145;mourning flock&#146; expressed their admiration and respect for their late pastor because of his abilities, labour, and piety  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 67/2, 1797, 796). A few of his discourses and letters, together with a short memoir of his life, were published in Richard Cecil, <span class="italic">Discourses of the honourable and reverend William Bromley Cadogan, A.M. &hellip; to which are now added short observations on the Lord's prayer, and letters to several of his friends</span> (1798).<br>
