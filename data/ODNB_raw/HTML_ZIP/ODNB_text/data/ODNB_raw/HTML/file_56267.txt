<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chilembwe, John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1870&#150;1915), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and anti-colonial rebel</span>, was probably born at Sangano, Chiradzulu, in modern Malawi, of a Yao father (reportedly called Kaundama), and a Mang'anja or Cewa slave mother (reportedly called Nyangu). Very little is known of his early life. He acquired a basic knowledge of English from one of the earliest outposts of Scottish Presbyterian missionaries. In 1892 he became &#145;cook boy&#146; to the recently arrived independent English missionary Joseph Booth (1851&#150;1932) at his Zambezi industrial mission, near Blantyre. Booth was a controversial, unorthodox, radical, negrophile egalitarian, considered a trouble-maker by settlers and officials. He later wrote that he and his daughter would have died but for Chilembwe's &#145;never wearying tender help&#146;  (Rotberg and Mazrui, 355). In 1893 Booth baptized Chilembwe and in 1897 took him to the USA.<br>
<br>After studying at the Virginia Theological Seminary and College at Lynchburg, Virginia (1898&#150;1900; AB and BD 1901), Chilembwe, in 1900 or 1901, returned to British Central Africa (Nyasaland from 1907) and, with crucial African American Baptist support and finance, established the Providence Industrial Mission in the Chiradzulu district. There, initially supervised by two African American missionaries (Emma B. DeLany and the Revd L. N. Cheek), he built up a network of village schools linked to a central church, and grew cash crops. In 1913 Chilembwe completed his impressive brick church. A respectable pastor, in dark suit and gold-rimmed spectacles, preaching the gospel and protestant Smilesian values and singing Moody and Sankey hymns, he may have seemed an exemplary &#145;new man&#146;. But he was apparently increasingly politically disaffected. His mission adjoined the Scottish owned Magomero estate, managed by William Jervis Livingstone. Chilembwe became a sounding board for the grievances of Magomero Africans working for low pay under the forced labour system, and also of black African businessmen denied tax rebates, unlike their white counterparts. The settlers considered the mission a &#145;hornets' nest&#146;. Chilembwe, who is said to have had a previous wife, married Ida Z., who is thought to have been of mixed parentage; they had a daughter, who died before 1914, and two sons.<br>
<br>The years immediately preceding the First World War were difficult ones financially for Chilembwe and his followers. These were also years of increased millenarian expectation and fresh forms of Christian enthusiasm in Nyasaland. Chilembwe also had increasing problems with his eyes and with his (possibly psychosomatic) asthma. The two developments which appear to have pushed him into armed revolt were, first, the outbreak of the war and the severe casualties suffered by Africans at the battle of Karonga (9 September 1914), when a British force defeated a German force from German East Africa and, second, the excision by officials of his letter of protest to the <span class="italic">Nyasaland Times</span> in November 1914; this stated his view that &#145;the poor Africans who have nothing to own in this present world &hellip; are invited to die for a cause which is not theirs&#146;  (Shepperson and Price, 235). Admittedly, reports of Chilembwe's new militant mood had been reaching officials for some time. Historians differ on the causes and significance of his revolt. None the less, Shepperson's and Price's assumption in their 1958 biography, <span class="italic">Independent African</span>, that the excision of his letter was for him the last straw, still seems persuasive.<br>
<br>Evidence is lacking on Chilembwe's aims. He seems to have intended to establish an independent African state, a theocratic &#145;New Jerusalem&#146;. Possibly he sought martyrdom, perhaps as an African John Brown. Apparently hastily improvised, Chilembwe's rising began on 23 January 1915 with attacks on Europeans. Chilembwe directed from his headquarters at his church. Rebels killed and decapitated W. J. Livingstone and took his head on a pole to the church where it was exhibited during Chilembwe's Sunday service. He appealed to the Germans for help but his message did not reach General von Lettow-Vorbeck until March, and in any case the Germans probably could not have helped even had they wanted to. The British were over-confident, unprepared, and taken by surprise. However, the rising was bungled and confused and, though inter-tribal, had only limited support&#151;fewer, possibly far fewer, than 900 were actively engaged. The rebels did not know what to do, apparently expecting divine intervention. The uprising was suppressed in less than a fortnight. Chilembwe and others fled towards Portuguese territory. On 3 February 1915 a police patrol in the bush north of Mlanje, near the Mozambique border, who had fired on a fleeing group of rebels, found they had killed Chilembwe. On 4 February he was buried in thick bush about 2 miles from the boma at Mlanje, so quietly that many Africans refused to believe he was dead. Many believed he had escaped and would return to liberate them. Government forces demolished his church with dynamite; rebel leaders were executed and followers imprisoned. Chilembwe's widow is reported to have died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. Chilembwe later came to be regarded as a nationalist hero and martyr of Malawi: according to the UNESCO <span class="italic">History of Africa</span> his posthumous significance &#145;exceeded his earthly accomplishments&#146;  (Adu Boahen, 190).<br>
