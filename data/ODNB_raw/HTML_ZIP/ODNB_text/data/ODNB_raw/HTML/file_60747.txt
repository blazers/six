<span class="headword">Mackintosh,  Allan Roy</span>  (1936&#150;1995), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 22 January 1936 in Nottingham, the younger of the two sons of Malcolm Roy Mackintosh and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. His brother, Ian, was born in 1927. According to Mackintosh's own account,<blockquote>The family lived in a working-class neighbourhood of very good type, with honest and helpful people. My father joined the Royal Air Force when I was four years old, and thereafter I scarcely saw him again, because my parents were divorced at the end of the war. Thereafter we were very poor, but I nevertheless had a very happy childhood, largely due to my mother, whose support and deep belief in education, together with the availability of scholarships, allowed me to attend an excellent school and an excellent university. &hellip; My brother always set an excellent example, and it was largely through his influence that I became a physicist like him. (Bleaney, 323)</blockquote>After attending Haydn Road primary school, Nottingham, he went as a foundation scholar to Nottingham high school from 1947 to 1954. From there he won a scholarship to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to read physics. He graduated with first-class honours in 1957, and won the Tait prize for physics both that year and in 1958. From 1957 to 1960 he continued his studies at the Royal Society Mond Laboratory in Cambridge where, supervised by Professor Brian Pippard, he investigated the Fermi surface of metals. He gained his PhD in 1960 for his dissertation, &#145;Ultrasonic attenuation in metals&#146;.<br>
<br>While at Cambridge, Mackintosh met a young Danish woman, Jette Stannow, the daughter of Erik Stannow, industrial manager, and his wife, Ida, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lyng. They married on 30 August 1958 at Birker&oslash;d, near Copenhagen. They had two daughters, Anne Karen (<i>b</i>. 1959) and Ida Alys (<i>b</i>. 1964), and a son, Paul Erik (<i>b</i>. 1962). In 1960 Mackintosh accepted an appointment as associate professor of physics at Iowa State University, Ames, where he continued his study of the electronic structure of metals by a variety of sophisticated techniques. He pioneered the use of positron annihilation and magneto-acoustic effects on liquid and solid metals. He also contributed to the theoretical understanding of various metals, including tungsten, gallium, and mercury.<br>
<br>At Ames, Professors F. W. Spedding and S. Legvold had begun separation of the lanthanide (rare earth) metals. Because the chemical properties of these metals are very similar this was difficult. As soon as pure samples of the metals had been prepared the magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity were studied. Early measurements of the heat capacity at low temperatures in Oxford started with the lighter elements, moving on to terbium, which has a large hyperfine structure. Attempts at Ames to interpret preliminary measurements by neutron scattering on polycrystalline metals showed that single crystals were needed. The first samples of sufficient size for a range of measurements were prepared there in the late 1950s. They revealed that the magnetic properties are unusually complicated through the interplay of exchange and crystal field interactions. Clearly, further investigations would form a challenge to the inquisitive physicist. Mackintosh took this up and established himself as the leading expert in this new field. Following a sabbatical year (1963&#150;4) at the Danish National Laboratory, Ris&oslash;, he realized that neutron scattering could provide precise information on the magnetic and lattice dynamics of the lanthanide metals.<br>
<br>Mackintosh and his family moved permanently to Denmark in 1966. After four years as research professor at the Technical High School (later renamed the Technical University of Denmark) he was appointed professor of physics at Copenhagen University. In 1971 he became director of the National Laboratory at Ris&oslash;, near Roskilde. Mackintosh had taken with him some single crystals of rare earth metals. On these, using a new reactor and novel techniques for neutron scattering experiments, with Hans Bjerrum M&oslash;ller and others he made the first measurements on spin waves and magnetic structures. After the lighter lanthanide elements he studied some alloys and found that the interactions were anisotropic and again very complicated. In addition to his own work he provided the motivation and encouragement for many others, in England as well as in Denmark. He remained as director of the Danish National Laboratory until 1976, when he returned to his chair in Copenhagen.<br>
<br>In later years Mackintosh turned his attention to the history of physics, including the first use of computers for calculations. At a conference, in an after-dinner speech later published as a posthumous paper in <span class="italic">Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London</span> (1997), he compared the work of Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr. His title, &#145;The crocodile and the elephant&#146;, alluded to the crocodile carved on the wall of the Royal Society Mond Laboratory in Cambridge, and the order of the Elephant, one of the highest Danish national honours, awarded to Bohr. An earlier publication of the Royal Danish Scientific Society, in 1980, showed that Mackintosh had mastered the Danish language&#151;the title (in English) was &#145;From chaos to order: solid state physics in the twentieth century&#146;. He drew attention to the little-known doctoral thesis by Niels Bohr, entitled &#145;Studies of the electron theory of metals&#146; (1911). At Cambridge, Bohr had attempted to interest Sir Joseph Thomson in it, without success because it was in Danish. Somewhat disappointed, Bohr turned his attention to other phenomena&#151;&#145;a loss for metal physics, but a great step forward for atomic physics&#146;  (Bleaney, 327).<br>
<br>Mackintosh was a firm believer in international co-operation in science. He was president of the European Physical Society from 1980 to 1982 and served on many committees in Brussels, being particularly influential in the development of the EU large installation programme. He was a member of the Danish planning committee for research from 1982 to 1985 and director of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics from 1986 to 1989. With Jens Jensen he wrote <span class="italic">Rare Earth Magnetism: Structures and Excitations</span> (1991), which soon became a classic text. He was appointed a knight of the Dannebrog order in 1975, and received the F. H. Spedding award in 1986. He was elected a member of the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences in 1972, the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters in 1977, and FRS in 1991. He died in Roskilde, Denmark, following a car accident on 20 December 1995. He was survived by his wife and three children. A memorial symposium was held in Copenhagen on 26&#150;9 August 1996; the proceedings were published by the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters in 1997.<br>
