<span class="headword">Blakesley,  Joseph Williams</span>  (1808&#150;1885), <span class="occ">dean of Lincoln</span>, was born at 38 Coleman Street, in the city of London, on 6 March 1808, and baptized privately on 22 April. His parents were Jeremiah George and Elizabeth Blaksley, as the name was then spelt. His father, who was a factor, died before his son had reached the age of ten. He entered St Paul's School, London, on 3 October 1819, after which he matriculated with a Stock scholarship and a special exhibition at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 3 November 1827. Among his close friends there were R. Chenevix Trench (subsequently archbishop of Dublin), R. Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton), Henry Alford, James and Thomas Story Spedding, Alfred Tennyson, and his brothers. His friendships among Trinity men led to his migration from Corpus to Trinity in Lent 1830. As an undergraduate Blakesley was influenced by J. C. Hare and Connop Thirlwall, through their association with the Cambridge Conversazione Society.<br>
<br>Blakesley joined the &#145;youthful band of friends&#146; forming the celebrated Apostles' club. The club, under the influence of its &#145;second father&#146;, Professor F. D. Maurice, the &#145;creator not of its form but of its spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Maurice's Life and Letters</span>, i. 110), greatly influenced Blakesley. He was the<blockquote>
<div>Clear-headed friend, whose joyful scorn,<br>
</div>
<div>Edged with sharp laughter, cuts atwain<br>
</div>
<div>The knots that tangle human creeds<br>
</div>
</blockquote>to whom Lord Tennyson addressed one of his first published poems.<br>
<br>In 1829 Blakesley was president of the Cambridge Union, and in 1830 was elected to a foundation scholarship. He graduated BA in 1831, MA in 1834, and BD on 5 April 1849. He was a wrangler in the mathematical tripos and was placed third in the classical tripos, where his chief strength lay, subsequently obtaining the senior chancellor's medal. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1831, became assistant tutor in 1834, and was tutor from 1839 to 1845. Among his pupils were Lord Lyttelton, Lord Frederick Cavendish, George Denman, A. J. Beresford Hope, and Arthur Cayley.<br>
<br>Blakesley had originally intended to adopt the law as his profession, being admitted at the Inner Temple on 16 April 1831. He had a capacity for expressing opinion and summing up facts, but weak health led him to change his career. He was ordained deacon in 1833 and priest in 1835. In 1834, together with other Trinity liberals, including Sedgwick and Thirlwall, Blakesley announced his opposition to university religious tests. In 1840 he acted as campaign manager to the whig Lord Lyttelton in the election of the university high steward. He twice occupied the university pulpit at Cambridge (1840, 1843); his sermons were published as <span class="italic">Conciones academicae</span> (1843). In 1850 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the regius chair of divinity.<br>
<br>In 1845 Blakesley left Cambridge to take up the Trinity College living of Ware, Hertfordshire. On 21 August 1845 he married Margaret Wilson Holmes, daughter of Revd Thomas Holmes of Brooke Hall, Norfolk. They had seven sons and four daughters before Margaret Blakesley died in 1880. From 1850 to 1863 he was classical examiner in the University of London. As vicar of Ware he became widely known as the Hertfordshire Incumbent, whose letters in <span class="italic">The Times</span> newspaper examined social and political subjects of the day. The letters greatly increased his reputation, and in 1863 he received a canonry at Canterbury from Lord Palmerston, with whose political views he fully sympathized. In 1860 Palmerston had offered Blakesley the regius professorship of history at Cambridge in preference to Dr Woodham of Jesus, despite Blakesley's lack of credentials as a modern historian. He became proctor in convocation for his chapter, and was an influential, although very independent, member of the lower house, serving as a regular member of the committee for revision of the translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Although no scientific theologian, Blakesley took much interest in theological studies, especially in the critical and evidential department. He believed the divine nature of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> could not be established by impersonal science but was apprehended by individual conscience. By diminishing rational Christianity as a foundation for belief, he felt he could safely pursue rational biblical criticism. Poor health drove him to Algiers in the winter of 1857&#150;8. On his return he published an account of his sojourn under the title of <span class="italic">Four Months in Algiers, with a Visit to Carthage</span>.<br>
<br>In 1872 Blakesley succeeded James Jeremie as dean of Lincoln on Gladstone's recommendation. As dean he made Lincoln his home, and devoted himself to the interests of his cathedral and of the city of Lincoln. A practical man, he gave attention to the management of the cathedral, and opposed some of the enthusiastic projects for increasing cathedral activities favoured by his bishop, E. W. Benson. He did not see the cathedral as the mother church of the diocese, but as existing by and for itself. His view of the church was expressed in <span class="italic">Thoughts on the recommendations of the ecclesiastical commission &hellip; a letter to W. E. Gladstone</span> (1873), in which he argued that the church needed variety to retain all channels for talent: the scholar and the antiquary, not just the preacher and bishop.<br>
<br>Blakesley was master of the court of the Mercers' Company in 1864. As one of the governors he took a warm interest in the welfare of St Paul's School. His chief work was an edition of Herodotus for the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Classica</span>. His annotations were chiefly devoted to geographical and historical questions. He contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> and <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span> reviews and other periodicals, and wrote many reviews of books for <span class="italic">The Times</span> newspaper. He died on 18 April 1885, at the deanery, Lincoln, and was buried on 23 April at St Mary Magdalene, Lincoln.<br>
