<span class="headword">David</span> <span class="st"> [St David, Dewi]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 589/601), <span class="occ">patron saint of Wales and founder of St David's</span>, is known from written sources dating from no earlier than the eighth century and an inscription which may be of the seventh.<h2>
<a name="Theearliestcultanditssources"></a>The earliest cult and its sources</h2>By the ninth century David's cult was sufficiently well established for him to be one of three Welsh saints included in the early ninth-century Irish martyrology of Tallaght, in which he is placed under 1 March; the same feast day is given in the later Welsh calendars. Even earlier he is named in two lives of Irish saints which probably belong to the eighth century, those of Ailbe of Emly and Mo Lua of Clonfertmulloe in the <span class="italic">Codex Salmanticensis</span>. A ninth-century manuscript, probably relying proximately on a Breton source, contains &#145;certain excerpts from a book of David&#146;. These belong to a group of texts purporting to be of early British origin; the early date of the group is confirmed by their use in early Irish penitentials; but whatever the ultimate origin of the text, its preservation in this collection under the name of David suggests that the saint may have been of considerable repute in ninth-century Brittany as well as Ireland. This is confirmed by Wrmonoc's ninth-century life of St Paul de L&eacute;on, in which St David is described as Aquaticus (&#145;Waterman&#146;), a title given him on account of his ascetic practice of standing in cold water up to his neck. The written texts prior to the late-ninth century life of King Alfred by Asser reveal, therefore, the wide extent of his reputation rather than details of his life or his churches.<br>
<br>The inscription commemorates a man slain when plunder was taken from one of St David's churches, presumably Llanddewibrefi in Ceredigion, where the inscription is situated. The forms of the letters are consistent with a date in the early seventh century rather than with the early ninth-century date which has also been proposed. It belongs to a group of inscriptions whose principal letter forms are Roman capitals, but which have one or two letter shapes taken over from book scripts (usually half-uncial); these are attributed to the years around 600. The epigraphic evidence for dating probably outweighs the contrary testimony of a single late feature in the form of a name. The significance of this inscription lies in its confirming that the naming of the church after St David has a background going back to the pre-viking period, and that the cult had this important centre in Ceredigion, whereas St David's lay in Dyfed. The earliest direct evidence that St David's (in Welsh Tyddewi, &#145;The house of David&#146;, or Mynyw; in Latin Menevia or Vallis Rosina) was the outstanding church associated with the saint is Asser's life of King Alfred. Asser says that he himself belonged to the church, explicitly situated on the western extremity of Britain; he also writes of &#145;the monastery and <i>parochia</i> of St David&#146; and of his kinsman, Nobis, also of St David's, as archbishop. The other reference of pre-Norman date to a Welsh archbishopric is in the <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>, in which Elfoddw is termed &#145;archbishop of the land of Gwynedd&#146; in his obit, under the year 809. The archiepiscopal claims mentioned by Asser may be to pre-eminence among the bishops of Dyfed (as opposed to Gwynedd), or, more widely, to pre-eminence among the bishops of south Wales (so that Wales would be divided between two archbishoprics, north and south, on the model of England).<br>
<br>The earliest evidence that David might have been regarded, not merely as a leading, but as the outstanding, Welsh saint is in a tenth-century poem, <span class="italic">Armes Prydein vawr</span> (&#145;The great prophecy of Britain&#146;). This was composed when either &AElig;thelstan or his brother Edmund was threatened by a viking-led alliance; the purpose of the poem was to encourage the Welsh to benefit by the opportunity offered by this attack on West Saxon hegemony and to take up arms against their English overlord. One argument deployed in the poem is that the English had violated the rights of the Welsh saints and that the Welsh would be victorious under the patronage of St David. The saint was thus made into a patron in war as well as in peace, and furthermore a patron of the Welsh cause against English overlordship. St David was receiving the treatment given, at the same period, to such Irish saints as Brigit (made into a patron of Leinster against the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill).<h2>
<a name="ThecontextofRhigyfarchslifeofDavid"></a>The context of Rhigyfarch's life of David</h2>Written evidence only becomes reasonably plentiful from the late eleventh century, when Rhigyfarch ap Sulien wrote the first surviving life. Rhigyfarch (<i>d</i>. 1099) belonged to a family established in the church of Llanbadarn Fawr, close to Aberystwyth, and thus in the north of Ceredigion. His father, Sulien, however, had been bishop of St David's (at the western extremity of Dyfed) for two periods (1071&#150;8 and 1080&#150;85). Rhigyfarch claimed to have written sources for his life<blockquote>in the oldest manuscripts of our country, and chiefly from his own monastery. These, though eaten away along the edges and the backs by the continuous gnawings of worms and the ravages of the passing years, and written in the manner of the elders, have survived till now. (<span class="italic">Rhigyfarch's Life</span>, 48)</blockquote>It has been claimed that the <span class="italic">Life</span> was written to defend the reputation of the saint and the rights of St David's in the aftermath of the Norman invasion of Dyfed in 1093. This followed shortly after the destruction of St David's by a Hebridean fleet in 1091, which in turn was only two years after the shrine of St David was stolen from the church and its gold and silver covering removed. The supposition that Rhigyfarch wrote the life to defend the reputation of the saint in the face of the Norman invasion of Ceredigion and Dyfed is plausible but by no means necessary.<br>
<br>Not only may Rhigyfarch's life of David have been a reaction to one or other of the earlier disasters, it was also a reaction to more long-term problems. The eleventh and twelfth centuries were a period in which the number of churches in Wales that could claim episcopal status was reduced to four: St David's, Llandaff, Bangor, and St Asaph. In the ninth century, however, there had been a bishop based at Llandeilo Fawr (in Ystrad Tywi, a semi-detached portion of the old <i>civitas</i> of the Demetae). In the early tenth century there had been another, Cyfeilliog, who appears in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> as bishop in Ergyng (Archenfield, now in south-west Herefordshire). In 1005 &AElig;thelred II granted land at Over in Gloucestershire to the bishopric at Dewstow; although it has been thought that Dewstow was simply an English name for St David's, it has more plausibly been identified with Dewstow near Chepstow. In the middle years of the eleventh century an old bishopric attached to the community of Cynidr (in the valleys of the Usk and Wye) came to an end, when the last of the sequence of bishops became attached to Hereford. It is unlikely that, at any point in the period 600&#150;1000, there was only one bishop in Dyfed, let alone in the whole of south Wales: Aldhelm (<i>d</i>. 710), in his letter to Geraint, king of Dumnonia, refers to the bishops of Dyfed as well as to the bishops of Dumnonia. One difference between Britain and Gaul seems to have been that, in Britain, the old rule of one bishop to each <i>civitas</i> did not apply. Much later than Aldhelm, a probably eleventh-century text, embedded in the twelfth- and thirteenth-century Welsh laws, names seven &#145;bishop-houses&#146; in Dyfed, chief of which was St David's (Mynyw), to which it ascribes a supremacy over all the churches of Wales. The text does not imply that all seven were currently the sees of bishops, and they are likely to have been churches in which bishops were known to have resided and to have been buried.<br>
<br>One crucial issue for the community of St David's in the late eleventh century was to ensure that their church became the single episcopal see for as much of south Wales as possible. Their ability to attract Sulien from Llanbadarn to be their bishop is one sign that they were succeeding; the attempt by Rhys ap Tewdwr and Gruffudd ap Cynan to associate their causes with St David's is another; a third is the pilgrimage of William the Conqueror to St David's in 1081. This may have been the occasion on which William reduced Rhys ap Tewdwr to that condition of acknowledged tributary clientship in which he appears in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>; but it was still worthwhile for the much feared conqueror to make the pilgrimage to Dyfed's leading saint, when he brought the kingdom under his overlordship. In the event, St David's would embrace Dyfed, Ceredigion, Brycheiniog, Gower and Cydweli, Elfael, Maelienydd, and the neighbouring lands between the Severn and the Wye, effectively everything outside Glamorgan and Gwent. One of the principal purposes of the Rhigyfarch life was, therefore, to assert David's claim to be the leading bishop of Wales. Asser's reference to Archbishop Nobis indicates that Rhigyfarch may well, as he himself implied, have found useful ammunition in the remnants of the church's archive.<br>
<br>Yet even the particular issue of the primacy of St David's is far from exhausting the significance of Rhigyfarch's life of David. Quite as important was the necessity of setting out the position of St David within a body of traditions about the early saints of Ireland and Wales. Incidents from the life can be paralleled in the contemporary life of St Cadog of Llancarfan in Glamorgan, written by Lifris, and also in the lives of M&aacute;ed&oacute;c of Ferns, Ailbe of Emly, Cainnech of Aghaboe, and Finnian of Clonard. Of these, the lives of Cainnech and Ailbe are likely to belong to the eighth century. A particular incident can be attributed in one life to St David's, in another to Llancarfan. Even if the location of a story were undisputed, its significance could vary: in the lives of Ailbe and David, the Munster saint is agreed to have baptized St David, but Rhigyfarch's text has no place for the further claims made in the life of St Ailbe to some kind of superiority over St David's. The hagiographical tradition was, therefore, contentious and fluid. In such circumstances, a well-written life was likely to be essential for the continuing strength of the cult. This was what Rhigyfarch supplied, and his success is illustrated by the way his original text (best preserved, contrary to some modern views, in BL, Cotton MS Vespasian A. xiv) spawned daughter versions in the course of the twelfth century.<h2>
<a name="RhigyfarchslifeofDavidstructureandcontent"></a>Rhigyfarch's life of David: structure and content</h2>The life of St David (<span class="italic">Vita sancti Davidis</span>) is a carefully constructed text, with a much clearer structure than most of the earlier lives with which Rhigyfarch is likely to have been familiar. Although some sections, such as the account of the saint's death, are in close accord with standard Irish hagiographic practice, others, notably that describing the manner of life, <i>conversatio</i>, of the monastery, stand out as exceptional. But even those passages which follow a pre-existing norm have important variations on standard themes. The plan of the <span class="italic">Life</span> may be conveniently summarized as follows: prophecy, conception, birth, infancy, and education (chapters 1&#150;11); pastoral work and the foundation of churches (12&#150;14); the foundation of St David's and the conflict with Baia or Boia (15&#150;19); the manner of life (<i>conversatio</i>) at St David's in the time of the founder (20&#150;32); miracles connected with wells (33&#150;4) and with three Irish saints (35&#150;43); the pilgrimage to Jerusalem (44&#150;8); synods and the archbishopric of Britain (49&#150;58); death; concluding remarks on sources, ending with a request for readers' prayers. In the Vespasian version, the life proper is followed by the saint's genealogy (on his father's side only) and the proper for his feast day.<br>
<br>Rhigyfarch's narrative begins thirty years before David's conception with the prophecy of his birth by an angel to his father, Sant, king of Ceredigion (<i>fl</i>. 6th cent.), and to St Patrick. The angel warned Patrick against settling at St David's (here given the Latin name Vallis Rosina), while Sant received a dream in which symbols of David's virtues appeared. Thirty years later he was sent by divine power to Dyfed, where he raped a beautiful nun, <a name="cosubject_20244"></a><span class="headword">Non</span> <span class="st"> [Nonnita, Non Fendigaid]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span>; as the mother of St David she became known as Non Fendigaid (Non the Blessed). Miracles attended the pregnancy, and David was born during a thunderstorm, supposedly on the cliffs near St David's. An Irish bishop, Ailbe, baptized the boy. He was brought up by his uncle Guistlianus and ordained to the priesthood. David then moved on for further study to &#145;Winctilantquendi&#146;, where his teacher was one Paulens, who encouraged him towards monasticism. He therefore founded twelve <i>monasteria</i>, nine of which Rhigyfarch names: Glastonbury, Bath, Crowland, Repton, Colfa, Glascwm, Leominster, Raglan, and Llangyfelach. David returned to his uncle, but, following an angelic warning, then moved to Vallis Rosina (Mynyw), with a few companions, where he founded his chief monastery, in the teeth of opposition from the local ruler. Rhigyfarch outlines the manner of life (<i>conversatio</i>) at the monastery, where the monks held all property in common and performed manual labour. David's miracles are then recounted: two concern the creation of wells, the others involve Irish saints, M&aacute;ed&oacute;c of Ferns in Leinster, here said to be one of David's disciples, Barre (probably the patron saint of Cork in Munster), and Mo Domn&oacute;c of Tibberaghny in Osraige. An angel then transported David and two companions to Jerusalem. The story then moves back to Wales, where David addressed the Synod of Llanddewibrefi, when a dove came down and rested on his shoulder, and the so-called synod of victory. David died at his own monastery, allegedly at the age of 147, and was buried there. Various efforts were subsequently made to calculate his date of death, of which 589 and 601 carry most plausibility, though without finality.<h2>
<a name="ThemesofRhigyfarchsnarrative"></a>Themes of Rhigyfarch's narrative</h2>The plan of the life balances chronology with other considerations. Thus the manner of life at St David's follows the account of its foundation; once the asceticism of David's rule of life has been set out, his miracles follow; and, when his sanctity has been demonstrated by his miracles, it is recognized, even as far as Jerusalem, where the patriarch elevates David to the dignity of an archbishop. This recognition of David's primacy in the East foreshadows his effective elevation at the Synod of Llanddewibrefi. Sections are linked where possible: the second part of David's miracles concerns three Irish saints, M&aacute;ed&oacute;c, Barre, and Mo Domn&oacute;c; the ensuing pilgrimage to Jerusalem sees David as the leader of a group of three south Welsh saints: himself, Teilo, and Padarn.<br>
<br>The life's opening prophecy has a dual function: on the one hand it serves to make it clear that, while St Patrick was British and belonged to an older generation than St David, God had already allocated Britain to David and Ireland to Patrick. Since Patrick was already long-established by the eleventh century as the patron saint of the Irish, David is here presented as his counterpart&#151;as patron saint of Britain and the Britons. A further prophecy from St Gildas&#151;likewise an older British saint, who had been unable to preach in the presence of St Non, then carrying David in her womb&#151;confirms this picture. David, therefore, was predestined to be an even greater preacher than the notoriously eloquent Gildas.<br>
<br>The beginning of the life is concerned with the primacy of St David among all the saints of Britain; and this theme resurfaces at intervals until the end of the work. Yet the declaration that David was predestined to sanctity was also designed to confirm the Augustinian orthodoxy of the hagiographer, Rhigyfarch, and to foreshadow the culmination of David's career at the Synod of Llanddewibrefi (section 7), when he preached against the Pelagian heresy. These two themes, David's primacy and his orthodoxy, were intimately linked: it was as an immediate consequence of his triumph in preaching the orthodox faith at the synod that all agreed that he should immediately be made archbishop and that St David's should be recognized as the metropolis of Britain. Similarly, in the section on his education, Rhigyfarch expressly notes that Paulens was a disciple of St Germanus of Auxerre, who had earlier preached against Pelagianism before a British audience.<br>
<br>The narrative of the saint's conception and birth had much more local, south Welsh preoccupations. There might be nothing very surprising in it: as the letters of St Boniface illustrate, illicit sexual intercourse with nuns was far from being a rare activity among early medieval kings in Britain. What is more surprising is that all this occurs in the text after Sant has been introduced as &#145;Sant by name and merits&#146;, <i>sant</i> being the Welsh form of <i>sanctus</i> (&#145;holy&#146;). True, it is emphasized, once Sant has been brought into the narrative, that he subsequently resigned his earthly kingdom in order to gain a heavenly one. Sant, however, having been king of Ceredigion, had been the ruler of Henfynyw (Old Mynyw), where David was first educated, while the outraged nun is said in the saints' genealogies to have been the daughter of Cynyr of Caer Gawch in Mynyw; and from Rhigyfarch's text it is clear that Non did indeed belong to Dyfed, in which the new Mynyw was situated. Father and mother seem to represent two kingdoms, each with a site called Mynyw, and, moreover, each with a special connection with Rhigyfarch and his family: they themselves were attached to Llanbadarn, while Rhigyfarch's father, Sulien, had been bishop of St David's.<br>
<br>There are further oddities about the relationships of Sant and Non. Sant was a king to whom an angel revealed the birth and the character of his son some thirty years before David was born; yet Non was the daughter of a local noble. The kings of Dyfed are mentioned only in passing, when the narrative relates that Non entered a church in which Gildas was accustomed to preach &#145;in the time of King Triphunus and his sons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, xxxvi). When David was born, and also when he founded Mynyw, he had to deal with secular powers, but these were presented by Rhigyfarch as local strong men in the neighbourhood of Mynyw, quite separate from the royal dynasty. The effect is that the kings of Dyfed are not given any credit whatsoever for the foundation of Mynyw. The result is all the odder, because the first local strong man, at least, is quasi-royal even though unnamed. He is a tyrant (and ever since Gildas British writers had called evil kings tyrants); also he attempts to kill the child when his magi tell him that a boy would be born &#145;whose power would expand over the whole country&#146;  (ibid., 31). This tyrant, then, was Herod to a Christ-like David. Many years later, when David came to found his chief monastery, Mynyw, another wicked chieftain, Boia or Baia, whom Rhigyfarch calls a &#145;satrap&#146; and identifies as a magus and an Irishman, attempted to repel the holy man. Boia, however, Ahab to his wife's Jezebel, was upstaged by someone even more implacable in hatred than he was. Not merely did she send her slave-girls to seduce the monks, but she went on to decapitate her stepdaughter, Dunod. The site of the decapitation was marked by the appearance of a spring, enjoying miraculous powers of healing, and by the construction of a chapel called Merthyr Dunod.<br>
<br>Merthyr Dunod illustrates another central theme of this part of the life. As the monks took possession of the site of Mynyw, so incidents associated with David attached themselves to the surrounding landscape. Ailbe of Emly, the leading saint of Munster, who baptized David, was commemorated at Llaneilfyw (St Elvis), 4 miles to the east-south-east of Mynyw. Within the parish of St David's itself, by the end of the middle ages several chapels commemorated other persons associated with the saint: apart from Merthyr Dunod, already mentioned, there were Capel Non, Capel Padrig, Ffynnon Faiddog (his principal Irish disciple, M&aacute;ed&oacute;c of Ferns), and Capel Stinan (a disciple, St Justinian). An element in the cult, therefore, was the provision of sites, with explanatory narratives attached, that a pilgrim might visit. The topographical grip of the cult was more than matched by the extension of the bishop's local authority. The whole cantref of Pebidiog was, by the twelfth century, in the lordship of the bishop; in the later middle ages it would be the hundred of Dewisland, &#145;the land of St David&#146;.<h2>
<a name="TheextentofDavidscult"></a>The extent of David's cult</h2>From Rhigyfarch's time onwards it becomes evident that there was a difference between those areas within Wales in which there are churches dedicated to St David and a more general acknowledgement of his status as the premier saint of the Britons. The latter emerges from support given by the rulers of Gwynedd to the campaign to have St David's recognized by the papacy as an archiepiscopal see. About 1140 Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr his brother wrote to Bishop Bernard of St David's to acknowledge his authority as metropolitan of Wales. At the end of the century Gerald of Wales again attracted support from Gwynedd when he renewed the campaign begun by Bernard. On the other hand, dedications to St David are from south, not north Wales; even in Ceredigion they are confined to the south of the River Aeron, while none is to be found in most of Glamorgan. If church dedications were to be taken as the principal evidence for the extension of the cult, it would have to be said that St David was far from being a saint for the Welsh as a whole. The most likely answer to this question is that church dedications sometimes had more to do with belonging to the <i>familia</i> of the saint&#151;the body of churches and individuals formally attached to the principal church of that saint&#151;rather than with the extent of the popular cult. This is attested by the fact, demonstrated by the careers of Rhigyfarch and his father, Sulien, that there was a cult of St David at Llanbadarn Fawr, in the north of Ceredigion, outside the area in which there are old dedications to the saint. On the other hand, not all dedications signified a formal attachment to St David's. Those in Cornwall (Davidstow) and in Brittany, centred on Dirinon to the east of Brest, were independent of any Welsh church. Yet the vigour of the late medieval cult in Brittany is attested by the miracle play entitled <span class="italic">Buez Santes Nonn hac he map Deuy</span> (&#145;The life of St Non and her son David&#146;). This situates Non's death at Dirinon and presents highlights of her son's career in a version influenced by Geoffrey of Monmouth's reconstruction of early British ecclesiastical history. Dedications therefore attest the existence, at some period or other, of a cult, sometimes associated with a formal attachment to St David's, sometimes sustained by a story linking the saint to the place; but the absence of dedications does not prove that there was no cult.<h2>
<a name="Thelatermedievalcult"></a>The later medieval cult</h2>On the far south-eastern border of Wales there were dedications to David in Ergyng, now part of Herefordshire and of the diocese of Hereford (such as Much Dewchurch and Little Dewchurch), and these survived. Llanddewibrefi, on the other hand, became the premier church of St David still usually within territory ruled by Welsh princes. Here the cult can be traced from the twelfth century through into the later middle ages. Gwynfardd Brycheiniog composed a poem in honour of St David (<i>c</i>.1175) in which Llanddewibrefi was the focus; the earliest copy of the Welsh vernacular life of St David was written in 1346 by the anchorite of Llanddewibrefi, who was also one of the scribes who wrote the <span class="roman">White Book of Rhydderch</span>, which belonged to Rhydderch ab Ieuan of Parc Rhydderch a few miles to the north-west of Llanddewibrefi. Rhydderch's son, the poet Ieuan ap Rhydderch, composed a poem in praise of the saint, which demonstrates knowledge of the life, probably in its vernacular version.<br>
<br>David's cult survived the Anglo-Norman conquest of much of Dyfed, the settlement of Flemings in what is now southern Pembrokeshire by Henry I, and also the imposition, also by Henry I, of his chaplain Bernard as the first Norman bishop. How well the new arrivals took to the old cult is demonstrated by the <span class="italic">Song of Dermot and the Earl</span>, a Norman-French <i>geste</i> about the conquest of Ireland: the war-cry used by the invaders was &#145;St Dewi!&#146; Bishop Bernard (bishop from 1115 to 1147) became a fervent convert to the cult of St David. It was he who, so it was said, gained a privilege for St David's from Pope Calixtus II and thus secured its future as a successful pilgrimage centre. In the same interest, Bernard also spent years looking for the corporeal relics of the saint. As a result of his expedition to Ireland, Henry II twice visited St David's, at Michaelmas 1171 and on Easter Monday 1172, on the second occasion dressed as a pilgrim. No mention is made by Gerald of Wales, the <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> or the <span class="italic">Brut</span> of any shrine, but the king made an offering to God and St David of two choral copes and 10<i>s</i>. of silver.<br>
<br>A shrine was built in 1275, following a dream by John de Gamages, prior of Ewenni. Its stone base may still be seen between two pillars on the north side of the presbytery of the cathedral. John's vision revealed that digging on a spot a certain number of steps outside the south door of the cathedral would uncover the bones of the patron saint. The bones thus disinterred were unhesitatingly identified as those of St David and enshrined. It was this shrine which was visited by Edward I and Queen Eleanor in 1284, while by the time of his death Edward appears to have possessed an arm claimed to be that of St David; as with William the Conqueror in 1081, a king of the English who wished to subdue the Welsh wisely paid attention to their patron saint. The bones themselves appear to have been placed inside a portable shrine or feretory, since the <span class="roman">Black Book of St David's</span>, a rental of the bishop's lands dating from 1326, demands that the bishop's tenants follow the relics on a day's march when the bishop, as lord marcher, went to war. Towards the end of the fifteenth century William Worcester, who observed that St Justinian (David's disciple) was buried near the tomb of St David, recounted a number of miracles dating from his time and from the previous centuries. A life of Justinian was incorporated into John Tynemouth's legendary in the fourteenth century.<h2>
<a name="StDavidandtheReformation"></a>St David and the Reformation</h2>The shrine of St David, decorated by three mural paintings, of the saint himself, of St Patrick, and of St Denis of France, and surmounted by a painted wooden coving, was destroyed in 1538. It was despoiled of its gold and jewels by the canons of the cathedral, but its destruction took place not only as a result of state policy, but also of the protestant inclinations of William Barlow, bishop of St David's (1536&#150;47). In a letter to Thomas Cromwell, of March 1538, he reveals that, having forbidden the canons<blockquote>to set forth fayned reliques for to allure people to supersticion &hellip; on saint Davids daye, the people wilfully solemnysinge the feest, certain reliques were set forth which I caused to be sequestred and taken awaye, detayninge them in my custody untill I may be advertised of your lordships pleasour, the parcels of the reliques are these: two heedes of sylver plate enclosing two rotten skulles stuffed with putrified clowtes; Item, two arme bones, and a worm eaten boke covered with sylver plate. (Wright, 184)</blockquote>This first glimpse of what was in the shrine&#151;and the second skull may well have been that of St Justinian&#151;was also the last, since the likelihood is that these, as with so many other Welsh relics, perished in the fires of Smithfield. The presence of the book is intriguing: perhaps it was the incomplete gospel book mentioned by Gerald of Wales.<br>
<br>Although one of the very first steps in the protestant reformation of Wales was the destruction of the shrine and relics of its patron saint, the seeds of a revival in St David's reputation lay in one of the intellectual arguments for reform. It was crucial to maintain that the early British church was the forerunner of the reformed sixteenth-century church: that it was independent of Rome and undefiled by popish superstitions and accretions. While the shrine was unhesitatingly identified as part of those superstitions, the historical figure of the saint was important for the protestant case. This situation produced a somewhat paradoxical stance: popular devotion for St David was suspect and needed to be discouraged; the great figures of the early British church, however, needed to be recruited to the protestant cause. This was the stance adopted by Richard Davies, bishop of St David's (1561&#150;81), in the &#145;Address to the Welsh nation&#146; prefixed to the translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> by William Salesbury and Davies himself, for whom St David was &#145;Archbishop David&#146;, and his countrymen only adopted the papistical &#145;faith of the English&#146; at the point of the sword. It was expounded with most learning by Archbishop Ussher in his <span class="italic">Britannicarum ecclesiarum antiquitates</span> (Dublin, 1639); like Davies before him, Ussher was concerned (probably also with one eye on the Arminian question) to invoke the Augustinian orthodoxy of St David and the Synod of Llanddewibrefi.<h2>
<a name="StDavidandStDavidsinthemodernage"></a>St David and St David's in the modern age</h2>By the nineteenth century the situation had been further complicated. In 1811 the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists seceded from the established church, which was soon in the position of being a minority denomination in Wales. One argument deployed by Anglicans against the nonconformists was that the Church of England represented the lineal and faithful successors of the great figures of &#145;the age of the saints&#146;. St David's College, Lampeter, was founded in 1827 to train a parochial clergy capable of withstanding the nonconformist onslaught. In 1853 the lives of the saints, that by Rhigyfarch included, were printed for the first time since the seventeenth-century Bollandists, by William Jenkins Rees, a clergyman of the diocese of St David's in a volume dedicated to its then bishop, after his nephew Rice Rees, a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, had written a scholarly account of the Welsh saints as an eisteddfod essay (published in 1836). Members of the Anglican clergy continued to be active in the study of the sources for St David and the propagation of the notion of &#145;an ancient British Celtic church&#146; right up to the time of Welsh disestablishment (passed in 1914 but suspended until the end of the war). In 1923 the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge published an annotated translation of the life by Rhigyfarch by Arthur Wade-Evans, who associated the composition of the life with &#145;the end of an epoch in Welsh history, that of the &#147;Ancient British Church of Wales&#148;&#146;  (Wade-Evans, <span class="italic">Life of Saint David</span>, xvi). This, in turn, was identified as the moment when the Welsh church fell under the sway of Canterbury. St David could now have a new future, as the patron of a disestablished yet independent Welsh church; the enemy without was now not so much Rome as Canterbury, perceived not as the leading church of the Anglican communion but as a symbol of English hostility towards Welsh liberties.<br>
<br>It was in the 1920s that interest in the corporeal relics of St David resurfaced. During Gilbert Scott's restoration of the cathedral from 1865 onwards, a niche was discovered in the wall of Holy Trinity chapel. It was opened out revealing an open-armed cross facing out into the presbytery behind the high altar, and surrounded by four other crosses. It seemed to belong to the cathedral of 1181 and was located on what was once the outer west wall of the building. Those who cleared the niche noticed that the lower part had been edged by a line of ashlar blocks behind which there were bones. In the nineteenth-century accounts no especial interest was displayed in the bones; they were simply buried beneath the floor of Holy Trinity chapel. At the beginning of the twentieth century, however, it began to be felt, on no good evidence, that the bones might have been those of St David and St Justinian, rescued at the destruction of the shrine in 1538 and hidden to prevent desecration. They were disinterred from the floor of the chapel and placed in an oak casket within the niche as part of the restoration of Holy Trinity chapel in 1923. In 1996 these bones were carbon dated resulting in dates ranging from the mid-twelfth to the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>In the modern period, therefore, St David has been a figure invoked in controversy rather than the unquestioned symbol of a nation. The Welsh national anthem, composed in 1856, in the heyday of nonconformist Wales, presented an image of a glorious Welsh past in which the bard, the language, and even the warrior received due acclamation, but not the saint. In the twentieth century the decline of Welsh nonconformity has left the church in Wales in a relatively stronger position. Yet the nonconformists were never much concerned to lay claim to the inheritance of St David, and it is the cultural shift represented by secularization that constitutes the greatest threat to the reputation of the patron saint of Wales, one more potent even than the iconoclasm of Bishop Barlow. It is a small but telling sign of the times that the name of St David no longer graces his college at Lampeter.<br>
