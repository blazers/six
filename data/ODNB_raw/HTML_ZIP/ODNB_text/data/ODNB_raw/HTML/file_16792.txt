<span class="headword">Lively,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;1605), <span class="occ">Hebraist</span>, was a scholar and later fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA in 1569 and MA in 1572. He was taught Hebrew by the eminent John Drusius, a former student of the trilingual college at Louvain and one of several religious refugees who promoted the study of Semitics in sixteenth-century England. He succeeded Thomas Wakefield as regius professor of Hebrew in 1575, but resigned from his college fellowship when he married Katherine Lorkin on 14 June 1578, with whom he had eleven children. In 1602 he was collated to a prebend of Peterborough, and in 1604 he was presented by the king to the living of Purleigh. He was among the learned men appointed by James I to be responsible for the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but died before the work got under way. He was buried at St Edward's, Cambridge, on 7 May 1605; his wife predeceased him, dying on 8 April 1599.<br>
<br>In the course of a distinguished career Lively proved to be a competent teacher and an able scholar. The letters which passed between James Ussher, later archbishop of Armagh, and his friends early in the seventeenth century testify to the respect in which he was held as a Hebraist by biblical scholars of his own day. His funeral oration, delivered by Thomas Playfere, Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Cambridge, demonstrates how successfully he had communicated his love of Semitics, and in particular his interest in and appreciation of rabbinic literature, to his contemporaries. Referring to Hebrew, Playfere says:<blockquote>Which tongue, howsoever some account of it, yet ought to be preferred above all the rest. For it is the ancientest, the shortest, the plainest of all &hellip; The rabbis themselves, though they have no small number of fables and lies in them, yet diverse things they have notwithstanding fit for the opening of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. Therefore though a man cannot read the rabbis, yet unless he can understand handsomely well the Hebrew text, he is counted but a maimed, or as it were half a divine, especially in this learned age. (Playfere, 1.57)</blockquote>Although three of Lively's works are extant in manuscript, as far as is known he is the author of only two books. The first was a series of notes on five of the minor prophets, originally published in London in 1587 and later printed in Pearson's <span class="italic">Critici sacri</span> of 1660. The second was his commentary on the seventy weeks mentioned in <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 9: 24&#150;7, that &#145;dismal swamp of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> criticism&#146; which engendered fierce debate among sixteenth-century theologians. Entitled <span class="italic">A true chronologie of the times of the Persian monarchy and after to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans</span> (1597), the book runs to 250 octavo pages, and offers ample evidence of the author's breadth of scholarship and of his attitude towards the Hebraic tradition of exegesis. As the title-page states, his intention is to expound &#145;the Angel Gabriel's message to Daniel &hellip; against the frivolous conceits of Matthew Beroald&#146;, a French protestant; but after refuting other opinions, he presents a well-ordered and logical case for his own understanding of the passage. His exegetical principles, on which he expands in a lengthy introduction, are twofold: &#145;the one is a just account of the times; the other, a true interpretation of the words in the original tongue&#146;. If the commentator fails in either of these, &#145;there is no hope to know what Daniel meant by his weeks&#146;  (<span class="italic">A True Chronologie</span>, 27). In his search for the true interpretation he has constant recourse to the &#145;judgment of cunning linguists and sound divines&#146;  (ibid., 44). The result is that the comments of classical authors, church fathers, and Jewish exegetes are harnessed to the task of biblical interpretation.<br>
<br>It is this blending of three quite distinct sources in his exposition of the text that renders Lively's scholarship exceptional for the age in which he lived. Classical learning, in which he himself was steeped, is recommended to all those aspiring to understand scripture. He stresses the contribution made by such non-Christian writers as Pliny, Horace, Homer, and Herodotus, to the understanding of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>: &#145;For many parts of Scripture they are diligently to be sought unto, and not as some rash brains imagine, to be cast away as unprofitable in the Lord's schoolhouse; but especially for <span class="roman">Daniel</span> above all&#146;  (<span class="italic">A True Chronologie</span>, 22). It was this reliance on classical texts for help in difficult places that displeased Richard Simon and led him to criticize Lively for parading his learning and &#145;adorning his discourse with unnecessary authorities&#146;  (Simon, 3.110). Simon represents a later generation of biblical scholars who rarely illustrated any points by referring to classical authors, and certainly did not accept them as authoritative. But in Lively's opinion these &#145;profane writers&#146; were important sources for the illumination of the word of God.<br>
<br>The second source of information was the church fathers, who should be respected by the exegete because they had the weight of tradition. Jerome, Eusebius, Theodoret, and Tertullian feature prominently throughout the exposition of the seventy weeks. Clement of Alexandria should be a constant source of reference because of his great knowledge, while Sulpicius Severus's comments on <span class="roman">Daniel</span> are invaluable because they are more illuminating than those of any other ancient writer.<br>
<br>Lively's third and constant court of appeal as he wrestles with the angel Gabriel's message is the work of post-biblical Jewish exegetes, lexicographers, grammarians, and historians. As well as <span class="roman">Targum</span> and <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, and the principal commentators of the late middle ages, he makes use of two significant lexicographical works, David Kimchi's <span class="italic">Book of Roots</span> and the <span class="italic">Tisbi</span> of Elias Levita. On matters related to Jewish history and chronology he introduces us to two sources not previously used by Christians: Abraham ibn Daud's <span class="italic">Book of Tradition</span>, a survey of Jewish history from 300 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to 1100 <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, and the <span class="italic">Seder `Olam</span>, a history of the Jews from Adam to Bar Kochba written in the second century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. A notable omission in Lively's list of Jewish authors is Isaac Abravanel, one of medieval Jewry's most illustrious sons, whose commentary on <span class="roman">Daniel</span> (<span class="italic">The Wells of Salvation</span>) was published in 1497 and again in 1551. In the whole of <span class="italic">A True Chronologie</span> there is not one explicit reference to it. This is all the more surprising when we remember the interest which Abravanel's writings generated among Christians. In all probability he is omitted from the list of rabbinic sources because of his spirited defence of Judaism and his refutation of the Christian interpretation of crucial passages. On the whole, however, Lively is favourably disposed towards post-biblical Jewish works, and states categorically that they are of value for the Christian biblical scholar: &#145;The Church of God &hellip; is much beholding to the Hebrew rabbis, being great helps unto us for understanding holy scripture in many places, as well of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> as the <span class="roman">Old</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">A True Chronologie</span>, 35).<br>
<br>By his linguistic expertise and his appreciation of rabbinic sources, Cambridge's second regius professor of Hebrew played a leading role in furthering Hebrew studies in Elizabethan England. Lively's only major published work reflects controversies about the interpretation of scripture current in the sixteenth century. In defence of his views he made extensive use of post-biblical Jewish sources, and on the whole adopted an unbiased attitude towards the Jews.<br>
