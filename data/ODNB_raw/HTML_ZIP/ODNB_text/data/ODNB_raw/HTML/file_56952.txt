<span class="headword">Eyles <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pitcairn; <em>other married name </em>Murray]</span>,  (Margaret) Leonora</span>  (1889&#150;1960), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born on 1 September 1889 at 5 Eastcott Street, Swindon, the eldest of three children of Andrew Tennant Pitcairn (1861&#150;1905) and his wife, Rosa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bevan (1863/4&#150;1902). Her family were Staffordshire china manufacturers whose fortunes declined after her birth. She was brought up at Tunstall, near Stoke-on-Trent, and educated at day school and then a local board school, passing the examination entitling her to stay at school as a pupil teacher at the age of fourteen. After her mother died, her father remarried, and following his death shortly afterwards she was left in the care of a young stepmother whom she detested. Forbidden to take up a place at a teachers' training college to which her matriculation results had entitled her, Leonora ran away to London where, at the age of eighteen, she scraped together a meagre living by addressing envelopes in a basement office. She sold one or two things left by her mother to raise the passage to work as a domestic servant in Australia. There, in about 1909, she married Alfred William Eyles (<i>b</i>. 1880), whose father, Alfred Eyles, later became accountant-general of the Royal Navy. Her husband, a medical student, then journalist, left her after they had had a daughter, born in New South Wales in 1910, and a son and daughter, born in London in 1912 and 1914. Forced to bring up their children on her own, she eventually obtained a divorce.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-four Leonora Eyles found herself living in a terraced house in Peckham in the East End of London, where she supported her family as best she could through poorly paid jobs including factory garment making and typing. She found more congenial work when, pushing her pram up Peckham Rye where William Blake had once seen a tree of angels, she chanced upon an advertisement for an appeals writer for the Dr Barnardo's group of orphanages, and was the successful candidate from five hundred applicants.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the First World War, Eyles volunteered to become a munitions worker in the Woolwich arsenal, where she greatly enjoyed the camaraderie of some 2000 women workers. The experience of urban poverty and economic deprivation affected Eyles deeply. Her observations formed the basis of a book, <span class="italic">The Woman in the Little House</span> (1922), a documentary study of working women's lives, which appeared in serial form in the journal <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>. Like Maud Pember Reeves's <span class="italic">Round about a Pound a Week</span> (1913), <span class="italic">The Woman in the Little House</span> directed the attention of the reading public to the struggles against poverty and hardship which formed the day-to-day existence of women in the inner-city slum. After the war Eyles was much in demand to address trade union meetings recruiting women workers. She argued that the state should recognize the importance of motherhood and was a strong advocate of the family allowance. Eyles wrote regularly for socialist publications including George Lansbury's <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, and edited the women's page in <span class="italic">The Miner</span> before becoming a columnist in <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span> and the country's best-known &#145;agony aunt&#146; before the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>'s Marjorie Proops. She married the journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68898/', "David Leslie Murray (1888&#150;1962)")</script>, editor of the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> (1938&#150;44) on 21 May 1928, but continued to publish as Leonora Eyles. She and Murray lived on the south coast of England for some of their married life. A pacifist and lifelong socialist, and also a vegetarian, Eyles was converted to theosophy in later life and abandoned her pacifist ideals at the start of the Second World War. <span class="italic">For my Enemy Daughter</span> (1941) is addressed to her elder daughter, who had married an Italian and was resident in Italy during the Second World War.<br>
<br>The first of Eyles's slum novels contrasting urban deprivation to rural freedom was the best-selling <span class="italic">Margaret Protests</span> (1919). The subtext of <span class="italic">Margaret Protests</span>, published shortly after Marie Stopes's <span class="italic">Married Love</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">Wise Parenthood</span> (1918), is birth control, a subject about which Eyles had learned from reading Havelock Ellis and Stopes. Faced with a feckless husband and then unexpected widowhood, Margaret Wayre, the central protagonist of <span class="italic">Margaret Protests</span>, supports herself by trading in abortifacients before realizing the folly of her ways and trekking out to the countryside to begin life anew. Like several of Eyles's novels, <span class="italic">Margaret Protests</span> is concerned with women's spirituality and depicts with unusual sensitivity and compassion a resourceful and resilient unsupported mother. <span class="italic">Margaret Protests</span> was followed by <span class="italic">Hidden Lives</span> (1922), the story of a woman doctor in an inner-city practice, and other novels including <span class="italic">The Hare of Heaven</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Captivity</span> (1922), based on her own marriage. Eyles wrote two novels based on religious themes, <span class="italic">The Shepherd of Israel</span> (1929) and <span class="italic">Strength of the Spirit</span> (1930), as well as the successful crime thrillers <span class="italic">They Wanted him Dead</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Death of a Dog</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">No Second Best</span> (1939).<br>
<br>Leonora Eyles became the trusted confidante of hundreds of working women who read her journalism and wrote to her about their problems. Although she lived in comfort in later life, she never lost the insights into poverty and hardship which her years in the East End of London had given her. Her column in the inaugural issue of <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span> (15 October 1932) introduced her as &#145;the woman who understands&#146;. She wrote several popular books offering advice on subjects including good housekeeping, sex education, nutrition, and family relationships. <span class="italic">Women's Problems of To-Day</span> was a best-seller in 1926. Other manuals included <span class="italic">Careers for Women</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Common Sense about Sex</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Eat Well in War-Time</span> (1940). Her autobiographical fragment is <span class="italic">The Ram Escapes: the Story of a Victorian Childhood</span> (1953). Leonora Eyles died on 27 July 1960 at her home, 32 Eton Avenue, Hampstead, London, from intestinal problems and diabetes mellitus.<br>
