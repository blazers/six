<span class="headword">Todd,  Henry John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1845), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and literary scholar</span>, baptized at Britford near Salisbury on 13 February 1763, was the son of Henry Todd (<i>b</i>. 1733/4), curate of that parish from 1758 to 1765, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. Admitted as a chorister of Magdalen College, Oxford, on 20 July 1771, he was educated at its school and proceeded to the college, matriculating on 15 October 1779; he graduated BA on 20 February 1784. Soon afterwards he became fellow&#150;tutor and lecturer at Hertford College, and he took his MA on 4 May 1786. The previous year he had been ordained a deacon; he served as curate at East Lockinge, Berkshire, and in 1787 he was ordained priest.<br>
<br>In his early preferment Todd was greatly indebted to family connections. His paternal aunts presented him to his first living, the perpetual curacy of St John and St Bridget, Beckermet, in Cumberland. More advantageous was his father's long-standing friendship with Bishop Horne, then dean of Canterbury, who secured Todd a minor canonry in the cathedral while exempting him from the necessity of residing on his living. This patronage was given oblique acknowledgement in Todd's service as Horne's biographer, including him in his first published work of 1793, <span class="italic">Some Account of the Deans of Canterbury</span>. Its accompanying &#145;catalogue of the MSS in the Church Library&#146; revealed Todd's scholarly m&eacute;tier, anticipating his later archival work at Lambeth. By 1792 Todd had become chaplain to Robert, eleventh Viscount Kilmorey, and James, second earl of Fife. Some time before that date Todd married Anne Dixon (1765/6&#150;1844). The union produced eight daughters, the baptisms of several of whom between 1792 and 1801 are recorded in the registers of Canterbury Cathedral. Todd's literary ambitions brought him to the attention of Archbishop Moore, assuring him a succession of livings in the gift of the dean and chapter of Canterbury: a sinecure rectory at Ogarswick (1791&#150;2) was followed by the vicarage at Milton, near Canterbury, which Todd held until 1801. Of greater significance was his association with the family of the eccentric antiquary Francis Egerton, to whom Todd dedicated the work which established his literary reputation. This was an edition of <span class="italic">Comus</span> (1798), which made extensive use of the important Bridgewater manuscript.<br>
<br>The patronage of Canterbury culminated in Todd's presentation to the rectory of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London, in November 1801, and with this advancement Todd took up residence in the capital. His arrival coincided with the publication of his <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>, an edition of Milton's poetical works. In addition to Todd's own copious annotations and judicious selection from previous commentaries, the work included for the first time extracts from Stillingfleet's projected edition, together with criticism solicited from the family of Thomas and Joseph Warton. Republished on four subsequent occasions, it remained the standard edition for fifty years. The first volume, a thorough biographical study of Milton, revised in 1809 and 1826, was published separately and enjoyed an equal measure of success. For his labours Todd was rewarded with the handsome sum of &pound;200, and his new-found celebrity was acknowledged with his elevation as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1802. His reputation firmly established, Todd next set to work on an edition of Spenser, for which he received &#145;a very liberal sum&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 7.59). Published in 1805, its reception was more equivocal, being &#145;severely but justly&#146; appraised by Scott in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 25.322). In April 1803 he became chaplain to John William, seventh earl of Bridgewater, who shared Todd's antiquarian interests. William commissioned Todd to write a study of his inheritance, the privately printed <span class="italic">History of the College of Bonhommes at Ashridge</span> (1812), which contained Todd's reflections on the Gothic style.<br>
<br>After the publication of his work on Spenser, Todd focused his interests mainly on the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth, where he became keeper of manuscripts (or records) and embarked upon his next major project&#151;a study of Bishop Walton and his circle's work on the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>. By 1807 Todd had been appointed librarian and chaplain to Archbishop Manners-Sutton; this testified as much to Todd's churchmanship as to his personal merits, since the prelate's chaplains &#145;were all High Churchmen&#146;  (Nockles). This favourable association saw an appreciable change in Todd's fortunes, with his appointment to a rectory at Coulsdon (1807) followed by the vicarage of Addington (1812), both in Surrey. In December 1812 he was created royal chaplain-in-ordinary, a position which he retained until his death.<br>
<br>The depth of Todd's philological erudition, first witnessed in his Milton, was further demonstrated with the publication of a new edition of Johnson's dictionary in 1818. The same year saw Todd's promotion as one of the six preachers in Canterbury Cathedral and the first occasion on which his learning was brought to bear on theological matters, with the publication of <span class="italic">Original Sin, Free-Will and other Doctrines, as Maintained by our Reformers</span>, the first of a series of writings which sought to defend the Church of England against a background of Roman Catholic and dissenting agitation. In the preface Todd expressed his dismay at the prevalence of erroneous doctrines of justification, which he identified as an animating force behind the &#145;Great Rebellion&#146;. For the next ten years Todd found himself engaged in various polemical writings, albeit of a scholarly hue. His next publication, <span class="italic">Vindication of our Authorised Translation and Translators of our Bible</span> (1819), answered the searching criticisms of its writers and their Caroline successors made by the Hebraist John Bellamy, who had published a new rendering of scripture in 1817. Todd's patient, largely philological exegesis, which sought to justify and explain their methods, revealed the depth of his study of Walton and his circle.<br>
<br>In 1818 Todd was presented by the earl of Bridgewater to the valuable rectory of Settrington in Yorkshire, where he took up residence. Except for occasional visits to London, which ill health made increasingly rare, he lived at the rectory for the next twenty-five years. Here, he established &#145;a tolerable collection of old books&#146; and a &#145;formidable body of tracts &hellip; their number being some thousands &hellip; commenc[ing] about 1540&#146;  (MS Bodl. Oxf., 1004, fol. 26<i>r</i>). He sustained a prodigious output in the next decade which culminated with his biography of Cranmer. His immediate efforts were concentrated on seeing through the press the fruits &#145;of the years passed delightfully in Lambeth Library&#146;: his <span class="italic">Memoirs of Bishop Brian Walton, with Notices of his Coadjutors on the London Polyglot Bible</span> (1821). In the polemical preface to the memoir, Todd drew comparison between the &#145;Great Rebellion&#146; and the present, and offered further unfavourable commentary on Bellamy's work. A companion volume, consisting of associated manuscripts deposited at Lambeth by the antiquarian Carlyle, appeared in 1823. Todd's scholarly labours were rewarded in 1824 with his election to the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>The same year saw Todd engaged with a more formidable antagonist, the most illustrious of Manners-Sutton's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, Christopher Wordsworth, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, whose robust assertion of Charles I's authorship of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> Todd set out to repudiate in his <span class="italic">Letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury on the Authorship of the Icon basilike</span> (1824). Wordsworth's vituperative reply, characterized by Todd as his opponent's &#145;verbosa et grandis Epistola&#146;, left its target apparently unscathed, remarking with genial contempt how the head of house had &#145;fired away his useless ammunition&#146;  (MS Bodl. Oxf., 1004, fol. 54<i>r</i>). Todd's more considered response, the baldly titled <span class="italic">Bishop Gauden the Author of the Icon basilike, further Shown in Answer to Dr Wordsworth</span>, appeared in 1829; it hardly aimed to conciliate, with pointed epigraphs culled from Hooker warning of &#145;glozening delusion&#146;; and Milton's portrait of Belial condemning:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">high words that bear<br>
</div>
<div>Semblance of worth, not substance.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>More significant was Todd's contribution to the debate which followed recent Roman Catholic accounts of the English Reformation: <span class="italic">Cranmer's defence of the true and Catholick doctrine of the sacrament [1550], with [an] introduction vindicating his character from Lingard and others</span> (1825). The &#145;vindication&#146; was published separately the following year and was followed in 1827 by Todd's dissection of his principal opponent's spirited defence, <span class="italic">Reply to Lingard's Vindication of his History of England Concerning Cranmer</span>. He broadened the controversy the next year with <span class="italic">Of Confession and Absolution, and the Secrecy of Confession</span>, which sought to clarify the Church of England's position against the misrepresentation of Roman Catholic apologists.<br>
<br>In 1830 Todd was appointed by the archbishop to the prebendal stall of Husthwaite in York Cathedral. The following year his two-volume <span class="italic">Life of Archbishop Cranmer</span> appeared; in essence a more compendious contribution to the continuing debate on the foundations of the established church. On 2 November 1832 Todd was installed in the archdeaconry of Cleveland, an office in the gift of the archbishop. With characteristic industry, in the following year he saw through the press <span class="italic">Collections Relating to the Benefices in the Archdeaconry of Cleveland</span>. Todd remained active into his eighth decade, contributing to the convocation debate (1837) and publishing an appreciative selection from verse renderings of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> in 1839. His last published work, <span class="italic">On Clerical Societies</span> (1841), was typically robust in its advice; warning clergy of the dangers of opening dialogue with dissenters and exhorting them to &#145;show the wisdom as well as the duty of obedience &hellip; to Episcopal rule&#146; and to &#145;maintain the well-founded conviction of the Apostolical constitution, and of the validity and importance of the Litany and Articles&#146;  (H. J. Todd, <span class="italic">On Clerical Societies</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Todd's writings may conveniently be divided into those of literary, theological, and antiquarian interest, so long as it is borne in mind that his erudite philological and historical flair remained conspicuous irrespective of his chosen field of enquiry. Indubitably, his edition of Milton was Todd's <i>opus magnum</i>, a significant feat of scholarship which remained authoritative for fifty years. The foundations of Todd's methodology, selecting commentary and annotation from earlier editors complemented by the fruits of his own research, was familiar to his contemporaries, who thus designated him an &#145;illustrator&#146; of literature. It is a procedure which broadly anticipates that of the variorum editions of twentieth-century scholarship. In his literary taste and judgement Todd was a confirmed Augustan; a follower of Pope and Gray rather than Wordsworth and Coleridge. His lack of sympathy with prevailing ideas helps to explain the unfavourable notice of one grudging obituarist, who complained that Todd's &#145;turn of mind was not poetical&#146; and expressed bafflement that he had dared &#145;to put a step into the regions of Parnassus&#146;. The Romantic belief in the prerogative of poets as literary critics is confirmed with the concluding remark that Todd &#145;should have left Milton and Spenser to Southey and Scott&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 25.323). The more measured appraisal of the historian of Milton's editors remains authoritative:<blockquote>Todd is a very industrious follower of the line of research pursued by Warton. While he added much to the material of his subject he contributed little to its method, and so must be classed rather among the useful than the great editors. (Oras)</blockquote>The same authority concludes that the most important and original component of Todd's edition was his thorough survey of the poet's sources.<br>
<br>Any strict distinction between Todd's historical and theological writings is unsatisfactory and would have been incomprehensible to their author who, as an expositor of the Church of England, was at once priest and scholar, controversialist and historian. Todd's work on Cranmer was as much an account of the identity of the Church of England, offering a corrective to the nascent Roman Catholic historiography of Lingard, Butler, and Milner, as it was a biography. In his theological writings a common thread is Todd's endeavour to demonstrate the origins of the eucharistic teaching of the high-church party in the writings of the founders of the English Reformation, while at the same time downplaying the influence of Calvin in their deliberations. In this, his keen opposition to any toleration of protestant and Roman Catholic dissent and his reverence for the Restoration high-churchmen, together with his friends Routh and Oxlee he was one of a &#145;short file&#146; of clerics who continued to give eloquent voice to the teachings of the Augustan Church of England on the eve of the <span class="roman">Great Reform Bill</span>. Yet the imperatives of scholarship were never subordinated to the expediency of party: Todd's meticulous and decisive contribution to the debate on a cherished high-church myth, the king's supposed authorship of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, proved that. Nor was he a bigot: his firm convictions on the preservation of the confessional <i>status quo</i> did not prevent his forming warm friendships with dissenters, most notably the publisher Charles Dilley, who left Todd a substantial legacy.<br>
<br>Of Todd's character his writings reveal only an unremarkable outline which may be summarized as fastidious, thorough, and, in the proper Augustan sense, polite. More revealing and attractive glimpses are afforded in his letters to the younger and importunate antiquary Edmund Barker, whom Todd indefatigably but fruitlessly attempted to lure to Settrington. Here emerges the stoic valetudinarian, the gentle but teasing wit, and the tireless, ever solicitous scholar. Two likenesses of Todd exist: one a sketch &#145;stealthily painted by a lady&#146;; the second a handsome portrait in oils by Joseph Smith dated 1822, currently in the possession of Magdalen College School, showing its subject in clerical attire.<br>
<br>Todd died on 24 December 1845 at the rectory at Settrington; he was predeceased by his wife who died on 14 April 1844. He was buried in the chancel of the church where a monument of plain white marble commemorates both husband and wife. A stained-glass window was put by the clergy in the tower at the west end of the church. The beneficiaries of Todd's will included St Bee's College, where his father had been a pupil and which received his copy of Walton's polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and the antiquary Philip Bliss, who received copies of Todd's scarce Lambeth manuscript catalogues. His important collection of books relating to Milton had been donated to Magdalen College some years earlier. To his unmarried daughters he left &#145;many volumes from his library&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 25.659). The sum of &pound;50 was left to the poor of Settrington.<br>
