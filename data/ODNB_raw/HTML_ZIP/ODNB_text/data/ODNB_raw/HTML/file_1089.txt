</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baines,  Edward</span>  (1774&#150;1848), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor, politician, and historian</span>, was born at Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire, on 5 February 1774, the second son of Richard Baines (<i>d</i>. 1811) and his wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Chew). Richard Baines, who was born near Ripon and came from a farming family, had moved to Preston and there married the daughter of a local merchant. He became a grocer, but Preston corporation took court proceedings against him as he was not a member of the Guild Merchant and so was not legally entitled to trade in the town. His son recorded that &#145;he resisted the vexatious interferences but was obliged to leave &hellip; and he removed to the village of Walton-le-Dale where he carried on his business&#146;  (Baines, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 14). This episode was said by Edward Baines to have been the last instance of the application of the medieval trading restrictions. Although that was not quite the case, it is clear that the symbolic significance of this demonstration of unreformed privilege helped to shape the markedly radical political views of the Baines family.<br>
<br>At the age of two Edward Baines was sent to live with his maternal uncle, Thomas Rigg, a slate merchant of Hawkshead in the southern Lake District, and for two years he attended the grammar school there. Wordsworth was a fellow pupil. When he was eight years old he returned to Preston to live with his family, and continued his education at the town's grammar school until the age of sixteen. He was then apprenticed to Thomas Walker, a printer and stationer of Church Street, Preston, who was also well known locally as a radical politician. His influence probably helped to develop further in Edward Baines the reformist political views which he already had in mind.<br>
<br>In 1795, with the approval of his parents and master, Baines moved to Leeds to complete his apprenticeship with Binns and Brown, printers and booksellers who were also proprietors of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. This was a crucial event in Baines's life, for although he remained a printer it was from this experience that he acquired his knowledge of, and taste for, journalism and newspapers. Two years later, in 1797, he set up in business as a printer at Briggate, Leeds, and on 2 July 1798 married Charlotte, daughter of Matthew Talbot, a prosperous Leeds currier. His printing business had not initially prospered&#151;partly because of a partner who proved unsatisfactory&#151;but by 1800 it enjoyed good fortunes, and Baines was financially more secure. This had been assisted by his marriage into a moneyed family, and the changed circumstances allowed him to contemplate an ambitious change of career. In 1801, with the help and encouragement of a group of reformist Liberals from the Leeds area, he bought the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, with all its printing stock, from his erstwhile employers for &pound;1552.<br>
<br>Baines then determinedly set about transforming what had become a semi-moribund venture, with a circulation of only 700&#150;800 copies, into one of the most influential and respected provincial newspapers in the country. By the late 1820s the regular sale was in excess of 5000, and the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> had gained a wide reputation as a prominent mouthpiece for moderate and responsible social and political reform. The strongly held views of its owner&#150;editor were directly reflected in its espousal of such causes as parliamentary reform, the abolition of the slave trade, Catholic emancipation, the extension of civil liberties, and the introduction of public education for all.<br>
<br>In his position as owner and editor of the town's most important newspaper, Baines inevitably began to play a significant role in the public affairs of Leeds. He promoted local improvements and encouraged and sponsored social projects such as the establishment of the Leeds Mechanics' Institution. His political views were expressed in his support for, and involvement in, the election of MPs for the West Riding, and in the late 1820s and early 1830s Baines was in regular correspondence with leading reformist politicians in London, informing them of opinion in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>While developing his newspaper Baines also engaged in historical research and writing. In 1815 he published his <span class="italic">History of the Wars of the French Revolution from 1792 to 1815</span>, which was later expanded to become a four-volume <span class="italic">History of the Reign of George III</span> (1823), while in 1822&#150;3 appeared his important <span class="italic">History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York</span>. In 1824&#150;5 the companion volumes, the <span class="italic">History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County Palatine of Lancaster</span>, were published, and the latter formed the basis of an ambitious four-volume <span class="italic">History of the County Palatine of Lancaster</span> (1836).<br>
<br>It is now known that most of the research and a sizeable proportion of the writing of these books was undertaken by others, notably the Oldham local historian Edwin Butterworth, and that therefore Baines's role was primarily that of enabler and publisher. However, the works have permanent value because of the quality of their research, the breadth of their scope, and their innovative style: as a liberal reformer of comparatively humble origins, interested in contemporary social and economic issues, Baines paid close attention to industrialization, recent history, and the local economic and social circumstances of Lancashire and Yorkshire. This was in very marked contrast to the backward-looking and &eacute;litist antiquarian approach which was so characteristic of most county histories at this time. That the Yorkshire and Lancashire topographical histories were published in revised and updated form later in the century, and that they were still highly valued and extensively used by local and regional historians at the end of the twentieth century, reflects the high and progressive standards which Baines set himself and those who worked for him.<br>
<br>Firmly established as an important reformist figure in local and, increasingly, in national political circles, Baines made the logical progression into parliamentary politics after the passing of the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. At a by-election in February 1834 he was elected a whig MP for Leeds, and retained his seat in the 1835 and 1837 elections. In this period he gained a reputation at Westminster as a fluent speaker in the cause of continuing social reform, campaigning for legislation to regulate factory employment and conditions, for the abolition of tithes, and on behalf of the Anti-Corn Law Association. In Yorkshire he served as a JP for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and in this work, too, his reformist and liberal instincts were applied&#151;he was a &#145;benevolent, just, and liberal-minded man&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In 1841, after seven years in parliament, he retired because his health was beginning to fail, and he spent his last few years in semi-retirement in Leeds, where he died on 3 August 1848, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Edward and Charlotte Baines had eleven children, of whom several became significant public figures in their own right. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1092/', "Matthew Talbot Baines")</script>, was a lawyer who went into politics, serving as MP for Kingston upon Hull, as president of the poor-law board, and eventually as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1090/', "Edward Baines")</script>, succeeded his father as proprietor of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> and maintained its place as one of the most important voices of liberal politics in the north of England. He was also the author of a biography of his father, and the important <span class="italic">History of the Cotton Manufacture</span>, to which his father contributed a chapter. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1096/', "Thomas Baines")</script>, a younger son, became a newspaper proprietor in Liverpool and wrote a commercial history of Liverpool. The powerful moral, social, and entrepreneurial influence of their father is apparent in the careers of all three sons.<br>
