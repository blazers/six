<span class="headword">Corbould,  Henry</span>  (1787&#150;1844), <span class="occ">draughtsman and book illustrator</span>, was born in London (or possibly Robertsbridge, Sussex) on 11 August 1787, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6302/', "Richard Corbould (1757&#150;1831)")</script>; he was baptized on 11 September 1787 at St Andrew's, Holborn. His father was a prolific book illustrator and a landscape artist, and his mother, Charlotte, according to Joseph Farington's diaries, was a daughter of the Heath family of engravers: it is therefore unsurprising that both Henry and his elder brother George (1786&#150;1846) displayed youthful artistic talent. They both trained in painting with their father, and from 1801 both &#145;Master&#146; Corboulds had begun exhibiting at the Royal Academy. While George was eventually apprenticed to the line engraver James Heath, Henry was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools on 29 March 1805 at the age of seventeen. Having already shown a preference for subjects such as <span class="italic">Paris and Menelaus Fighting for Helen</span> (exh. RA, 1803), his neo-classical taste was no doubt consolidated by his training under Johann Heinrich Fuseli and his friendship with fellow students such as Francis Chantrey and Richard Westmacott. During his time at the Royal Academy Schools Corbould gained some recognition. In 1807 he was awarded a silver medal for a life study, and he received support from more established academicians such as John Flaxman and Benjamin West, who employed him as a model for several religious paintings.<br>
<br>It is not clear exactly when Corbould left the Royal Academy Schools, but in April 1812 he married a Miss Pickles of Chelsea, and three years later she gave birth to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32568/', "Edward Henry Corbould")</script>, the first of their four sons. It is perhaps as a result of these family commitments that Corbould chose not to pursue a career as a history painter&#151;concentrating his efforts instead on perfecting a delicate, rather feminine, neo-classical style which suited the purposes of refined Regency book illustration. During the remainder of his career he was &#145;extensively employed by publishers to make drawings for engravings, and the number of his designs, which adorn many books amount to several hundreds&#146;  (Britton, 2.172). This is also reflected in those works he continued to send to the Royal Academy exhibition, which were predominantly compositions of a sentimental and literary genre, commissioned to illustrate the novels of Walter Scott or the poetry of Byron and Crabbe. As was the case with J. F. Dove's edition of Fanny Burney's <span class="italic">Cecilia, or, Memoirs of an Heiress</span> (1825), many of Corbould's illustrations were turned into steel-engravings by his cousin Charles Heath; in other instances they were reproduced in fashionable media such as lithography and stipple engraving.<br>
<br>Aside from gaining a reputation for designing some of the most &#145;graceful and effective productions of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 7, 1845, 37), Corbould was renowned as an antiquarian draughtsman, and his commitment to this study is confirmed by his membership of both the Society of Dilettanti and the Society of Antiquaries. According to his obituary in the <span class="italic">Art Union</span>, he was &#145;distinguished by courteous and gentlemanly manners&#146;, and these qualities must have assisted his easy movement in such varied social circles. He also worked for the aristocracy; from early in his career he had been employed to draw the antiquities in the duke of Bedford's and Lord Egremont's marble collections for private publication in lavish presentation volumes such as <span class="italic">Outline Engravings and Descriptions of the Woburn Abbey Marbles</span> (1822). These noblemen undoubtedly appreciated Corbould's manners and had confidence in his abilities after his employment, by the trustees of the British Museum, in a long-term project to produce similar transcriptions of the Elgin marbles for <span class="italic">Description of the Marbles of the British Museum</span> (1845).<br>
<br>Corbould died on 9 December 1844 at Robertsbridge and was buried at Etchingham church in Sussex. The cause of his death remains a matter of some confusion. Most biographers blame a fall from his horse, while John Britton records that Corbould was a victim of an accident on the Eastern Counties Railway, when a train fell from an embankment, killing a number of passengers. Corbould was survived by his four sons; however, judging from an obituary in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> which mentions his engagement to Lady Chantrey, the widow of his old friend the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey, it would appear that his wife had died some time earlier. Certainly, in his will, written in 1832, he directed that his property was to be divided equally among his children, with no mention of their mother; he also bequeathed a diamond shirt pin&#151;&#145;a very trifling token of my love and esteem&#146;&#151;to Charles Heath's wife, and the choice of one of his pictures &#145;with its frame&#146; to his brother Richard.<br>
