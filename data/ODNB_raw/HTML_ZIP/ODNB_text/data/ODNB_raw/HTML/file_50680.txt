<span class="headword">Price,  Joseph</span>  (1736?&#150;1807), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and diarist</span>, was probably born in East Anglia. The nature of his early education is unknown, but he was brought up as a dissenter and maintained contact with several leading dissenters throughout his life. His father had been a successful tradesman in London. Price had two brothers, one of whom became a naval purser, and two sisters. In 1758&#150;9 he served briefly as minister to the small Independent congregation at Southwold in Suffolk, where a local source described him as &#145;an ingenious young man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kentish Parson</span>, 2). After one year he conformed to the Church of England, obtaining ordination in the diocese of Norwich as deacon (1759) and priest (1762). In 1762&#150;3 he served as curate of Rumburgh and South Elmham, and in the latter year became curate at Lowestoft. He was tutor to the son of Hill Mussenden, MP for Harwich, and through Mussenden's influence became perpetual curate of Tunstall, Norfolk, in 1765 and rector of Hellington, some 6 miles away, in 1766.<br>
<br>During the 1760s Price came to the attention of Thomas Secker, archbishop of Canterbury, and, like Price, a former dissenter. Through Secker's patronage Price, in 1767, became vicar of Brabourne in east Kent, the region in which he passed the remainder of his life. In 1776 he added the rectory of Monks' Horton to the vicarage of Brabourne and his two livings in Norfolk. He had already begun to compile an intimate shorthand diary, of which only the manuscript volume 6 (1769&#150;1773) survives, although internal evidence indicates that there were at least twelve volumes altogether. The diary is a remarkably frank, self-critical record of ambition and social climbing, with detailed accounts of the lives (and scandals) of the local clergy and gentry. Price was a correspondent of Charles Yorke (1722&#150;1770), son of the celebrated Lord Chancellor Hardwicke (1690&#150;1764). On Yorke's nomination as lord chancellor in January 1770 Price wrote: &#145;I must congratulate him and try to get something&#146;; four days later the news of Yorke's sudden death led Price to lament: &#145;The breaking of a blood vessel discomforts all my glittering hopes and tells me I must die Vicar of Brabourne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kentish Parson</span>, 9). This prophecy was not fulfilled; he relinquished Brabourne and Monks' Horton in 1786 on his appointment as vicar of Herne, which he exchanged for Littlebourne, his final living, in 1794.<br>
<br>Price never married and one reason for his bachelor status was his unfulfilled hope of acquiring a Cambridge fellowship. His diary reveals much knowledge of the university's politics, since he was enrolled as a &#145;ten-year man&#146; at Peterhouse and obtained the BD degree in 1776. He refers frequently to the question of subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and testifies to the extent of Trinitarian heterodoxy among some of the Cambridge fellows, such as John Jebb. Another reason why he never married, however, was the failure of his pursuit of wealthy matrimonial candidates. He rejected one on the ground that she was a Presbyterian and that such an alliance &#145;would make an odd figure in this neighbourhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kentish Parson</span>, 17), an indication of the distance he had moved from his dissenting origins. His chief target for marriage was Mary Lane, the widow of a London sugar merchant and twelve years Price's senior. Although Mary resisted his proposals of matrimony, she bequeathed her entire estate to him on her death in 1782. Price thus acquired a financial independence rare in a parish clergyman. He could afford to leave most of his duties at Littlebourne to a curate, to visit the hot wells at Bristol, and to lease a house in the Mint Yard, in the precincts of Canterbury Cathedral, where he died on 29 October 1807. He was buried at Littlebourne parish church in the following month.<br>
<br>Price appears never to have published anything, although a manuscript version of a funeral oration written by him for the first earl of Hardwicke (<i>d</i>. 1764) survives among the latter's papers in the British Library. While he lacked the conscientiousness (and literary flow) of his contemporary James Woodforde, the essentially private nature of his diary takes the reader far beyond the printed sermon and the begging letter to a potential patron, which are the only remaining testimonies to the character of so many clergymen of his age.<br>
