<span class="headword">Warner, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1649), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was a younger son of William Warner, landowner, and Margaret, daughter of George Gernigan or Jerningham of Belsted, Suffolk. It is likely that Thomas Warner was born at Parham, in Suffolk, where his father owned land.<br>
<br>Very little is known of Thomas Warner's early life. By 1610 he had married Sarah, daughter of Walter Snelling of Dorchester. They had two children: Mary and <a href="#cosubject_28755">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Warner served as a captain in James I's bodyguard and as lieutenant of the Tower of London before embarking for Guiana on 30 April 1620 with Captain Roger North. The charter of North's Amazon Company was revoked by James I after Spanish protests and North was recalled and gaoled in the Tower. His colonists were left to fend for themselves. By this point Warner had met Thomas Painton, who impressed on him the advantages of a colony on one of the smaller Caribbean islands, principally St Kitts. The chief advantage was that small islands were less likely than a mainland colony to attract Spanish attention. In 1622 Warner left Guiana for England. On the way he visited several Caribbean islands including St Kitts, where he made the acquaintance of the Carib &#145;King Tegreman [or Tegramond], king of St Christophers&#146;, and settled on that island as a likely spot for a plantation  (Hilton, 2).<h2>
<a name="SettlementofStKitts16231626"></a>Settlement of St Kitts, 1623&#150;1626</h2>After returning to Suffolk, Warner enlisted the support of Charles Jeaffreson, a neighbour and friend, and Ralph Merifield (or Merrifield), a merchant of London. In 1623 Warner, his wife (presumably Sarah), son Edward (aged thirteen), and about fourteen others, mostly from Suffolk, sailed for Virginia and from there to St Kitts, where they landed on 28 January 1624. The colonists set to work planting tobacco but their first crop was destroyed by a hurricane in September, which also carried away most of their houses. Their second crop was ready by February of the following year, and on 18 March 1625 Jeaffreson arrived in the <i>Hopewell</i> with men and provisions sent by Merifield. In September 1625 (either in the <i>Hopewell</i> or the <i>Black Bess</i> of Flushing) Warner returned to England with a cargo of tobacco. It may have been while in England that he married his second wife, Rebecca, daughter of Thomas Payne of Surrey; they had two sons, Thomas and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28764/', "Philip Warner")</script>, an army officer.<br>
<br>While Warner was absent a French privateer commanded by Pierre Belan, sieur d'Esnambuc, stopped at St Kitts badly damaged and in need of refitting. The French were welcomed to the island, and their desire to establish a colony there was seconded by the English, most likely because of fear of the island's Carib population. It is also possible that the English recognized some French claim to prior possession: when Warner's first party arrived on St Kitts there was at least one Frenchman already living on the island and perhaps more. After the French colony was begun the combined French and English forces (who in Thomas's absence were under the command of his son Edward) fought off two concerted attacks by Caribs from St Kitts and neighbouring islands, in November and December 1625.<br>
<br>While in England, Warner secured royal recognition and protection for his colony, receiving on 13 September 1625 the first letters patent for a West Indian colony and the title of lieutenant of St Kitts, Nevis, Barbados, and Montserrat. In the grant St Kitts is also referred to as &#145;Merwar's Hope&#146;, a name derived from the first letters of Merifield and Warner, but the name never caught on. After securing his patent, title, more investment, and letters of marque, Warner left England for St Kitts. With him were the London merchant Maurice Thompson, about 100 colonists, and sixty slaves. Along the way Warner's small fleet of three ships took some Spanish prizes in the North Sea and the channel before unsuccessfully attacking the Spanish in Trinidad.<h2>
<a name="TreatywiththeFrenchandwarwiththeCaribs16261629"></a>Treaty with the French and war with the Caribs, 1626&#150;1629</h2>Warner reached St Kitts in August 1626. Soon afterward an Indian woman (some sources suggest this may have been the same with whom Warner had an illegitimate son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28769/', "Thomas Warner")</script>, known as Indian Warner), warned him of another impending attack by the Caribs. In a pre-emptive strike French and English forces surprised the island's original inhabitants at night, killing Tegreman and expelling all survivors from the island except an unknown number of women retained as slaves. After killing or driving off the Caribs, St Kitts's French and English settlers concluded a formal treaty on 13 May 1627 that divided the island and defined the relationship between the two groups. The treaty awarded each end of the island to the French and the middle portion to the English. The treaty also provided for mutual defence against Spanish or Carib attack and dictated neutrality in a European war unless expressly forbidden by each government, and only then after a warning had been given.<br>
<br>In June 1627 Warner's patent was replaced by a proprietary charter granted to James Hay, first earl of Carlisle, which offered the island's planters secure title to their lands and assistance in defending the island in exchange for a substantial rent. Although Warner's own patent was voided, as <i>de facto</i> governor he was diligent in furthering the earl's interests. During the late 1620s the population of St Kitts grew steadily in number, wealth, and importance, bolstered by a steady supply of migrants. Captain John Smith relates the arrival of Warner's wife in 1627, presumably his second wife, Rebecca; it is not known when she died, but at some point Warner married Anne, whose background is unknown. They had no children. As St Kitts became more populous and prosperous Warner oversaw the expansion of English settlements in the Leeward Islands: to Nevis in 1628 and Montserrat and Antigua about 1632. Montserrat was settled largely by the numerous Irish migrants to the Caribbean, and Antigua was first governed by Warner's son Edward.<h2>
<a name="ConflictwithFrenchandSpanish16301636"></a>Conflict with French and Spanish, 1630&#150;1636</h2>By 1629 the demands of the increasing English population for land had begun to sour relations with the French of St Kitts, who complained of encroachments on their territory. Relief arrived in August of that year, when Esnambuc returned to St Kitts accompanied by six ships of the line and 300 colonists. Esnambuc demanded that the English abandon French lands they had settled and, after seizing some English merchant ships, compelled the acting governor, Edward Warner (Warner had left for England in September or November 1628), to submit.<br>
<br>Unfortunately for the planters of St Kitts, the French fleet did not linger long, and in September 1629 an overwhelming Spanish force under Don Fadrique de Toledo attacked and laid waste to the island. After a brief fight many of the French colonists managed to escape to St Martin, and Edward Warner surrendered the English forces to the Spanish. Under the generous terms of surrender most of the island's settlers were allowed to return to England, but many retreated inland instead. After the Spanish withdrew, these colonists elected a governor and set about rebuilding. They were soon joined by returning French settlers and later by Warner, who had been knighted in England on 21 September, no doubt in recognition of his services since the void of his patent; a week later, on 29 September, Carlisle named him as governor of St Kitts for life. Since the island had been surrendered to the Spanish, Warner was forced to renegotiate the rents owed to the earl (who had provided little or no protection from the Spanish). But despite his strained relationship with the planters, Warner resumed control.<h2>
<a name="Dissent16361639"></a>Dissent, 1636&#150;1639</h2>After the death of the first earl of Carlisle in 1636 loyalties among the English settlements in the Caribbean became tangled and strained. St Kitts and the rest of the Carlisle patent (which included the Leewards, St Vincent, St Lucia, and Barbados) were caught up in the disputes between the second earl of Carlisle and his father's creditors. Warner, ever loyal to the first earl, was appointed lieutenant-general of all colonies under the Carlisle patent, but his authority was openly challenged by Henry Hawley, governor of Barbados, who refused to supply men from Barbados for Warner's plans to expand settlement in the Antilles.<br>
<br>In May 1639, acting in keeping with royal policy, Warner entered an agreement with Chevalier Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, governor-general of all French island possessions, to ban tobacco cultivation in the islands for eighteen months. The policy was intended to prop up tobacco prices and force planters to diversify their crops. Although the French planters resumed tobacco cultivation after the term expired, tobacco planting in the English islands was banned for an additional twelve months, until 1 October 1641. During this period planters' debts increased, their servants' terms expired, and their plantations yielded them no marketable commodity. After they were allowed to resume planting, landholders faced the prospect of paying back-rent to the proprietor in addition to managing their increased debt burden and the need to pay for new servants. Since he re-established control in 1630 Warner had managed to rule St Kitts with an appointed council and without consulting the island's planters. But given the financial pressures on planters and Warner's staunch support for the proprietor's demand for rents, the situation soon became explosive.<h2>
<a name="CivilwarinStKitts16411649"></a>Civil war in St Kitts, 1641&#150;1649</h2>In late 1641 the island's planters rebelled and in early 1642 Warner and his council declared martial law and imprisoned some of the leaders of the rising, succeeding briefly in regaining control. Rebellion flared again after Warner's council executed a man named Short for defaming John Jeaffreson, an old ally and a member of the council. On 8 February 1642, facing some 1500 armed rebels to his 100 supporters, Warner was presented with the landholders' grievances. Among other things the island's planters refused to pay rent to the proprietor and refused to acknowledge laws passed without their consent. Warner issued a general pardon on 11 February and soon afterwards the island elected its first assembly of burgesses, which began drafting new laws regarding the payment of rents and debt relief.<br>
<br>But Warner refused to share power with a representative assembly and by the end of 1642 he was back in complete control of the island. How he managed this is unclear, but Bennett suggests he may have had help from the French. The burgesses were dispersed: some were executed, some imprisoned, and some banished. Others had fled. Once the Antilles came under parliamentary control, Warner was rewarded with an appointment (on 4 November 1643) as governor and lieutenant-general of the Caribbee Islands under Robert Rich, earl of Warwick. This grant would be confirmed when the patent passed to Lord Willoughby of Parham, and Warner's position as the chief official in the British West Indies and the unquestioned ruler of St Kitts would continue until his death.<br>
<br>As a colonial governor and investor Warner was remarkably successful. Compared with other islands, St Kitts under his leadership was relatively stable and quickly profitable. In 1639 Warner estimated that the island generated &pound;12,000 in fees and duties. Further, he survived many political changes, remaining virtually synonymous with the government of St Kitts from its founding until his death. His inflexible rule and powerful connections spared his colony the turmoil experienced by Barbados, but he also unwittingly contributed to the declining importance of the island among the British West Indian colonies. By the time the sugar revolution had come to Barbados, St Kitts's small landholdings, depleted soil, lack of credit, and high population density made it unsuitable for sugar plantation, and it forever faded in importance in comparison. Warner died on 10 March 1649 and was buried in the churchyard of St Thomas, Middle Island, St Kitts. His wife Anne outlived him by over forty years and died between 16 July 1692 and 27 February 1693.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28755"></a><span class="headword">Edward Warner</span>  (<em>b. </em>1609/10), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, Sir Thomas's eldest son, travelled with his father on the initial voyage to St Kitts and acted as deputy governor of that colony during his father's frequent absences. Hilton describes him as &#145;young in yeares, &amp; as yett not ensighted in government&#146; but innocent of the plottings of his advisers (which in one case included murder): he was &#145;alwayes of a loving, affable, tender disposicion&#146;  (Hilton, 6&#150;7). In 1632 he was appointed by Sir Thomas the first governor of Antigua. Very little else is known of his life except that his wife and child are said to have been carried away from Antigua by Caribs in 1640. This tragedy is said to have contributed to his early death, the date of which is unknown.<br>
