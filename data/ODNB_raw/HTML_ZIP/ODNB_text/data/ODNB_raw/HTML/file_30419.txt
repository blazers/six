<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Angell, Sir  (Ralph) Norman</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ralph Norman Angell Lane]</span>  (1872&#150;1967), <span class="occ">peace campaigner and author</span>, was born on 26 December 1872 in the Mansion House, Holbeach, Lincolnshire, the sixth of seven children of Thomas Angell Lane JP, who owned a small chain of shops, and his wife, Mary Ann Abbot (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Brittain). Almost nothing is known about his parents; and many details of his own life remain uncertain because it was lived almost entirely outside record-keeping organizations and because he was casual about personal information, particularly dates. For most of his life he believed himself to be two years younger than he was, and therefore gave the wrong year of birth in every <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry from his first appearance in 1912 until 1960. He allowed inconsistent information to appear both in reference books and in his own writings. And he rarely dated his private letters, with the result that even the studies based on the personal archive he sold to Ball State Teachers' College (later University) at Muncie, in Indiana, cannot resolve all the problems. A comprehensively researched biography is still much needed.<h2>
<a name="JournalisminEnglandAmericaandFrance"></a>Journalism in England, America, and France</h2>It seems likely that the unconventional and limited education which Angell described in his memoirs helped him become an effective propagandist, but stopped him gaining the recognition as an intellectual which he subsequently craved. After an unhappy experience at the preparatory school to which he was sent at the age of nine, he was educated first at a local school kept by an Anglican clergyman and then, from about 1884, at the Lyc&eacute;e de St Omer, in France, where he became proficient in French and was, or so he later claimed, first influenced in a rationalist direction by reading John Stuart Mill's <span class="italic">Essay on Liberty</span>. (He later joined the Rationalist Peace Society, an obscure and short-lived body founded in 1910.) About 1887 he returned to England, and attended a business college in London before working as a journalist on the <span class="italic">Southern Star</span> in Weymouth. Thereafter he went abroad again, spending a year (probably 1888&#150;9) working on an English-language paper, <span class="italic">The Telegraph</span>, in Geneva, where he also attended lectures at the university and consorted with revolutionary Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s. On returning to his home country, he briefly edited the <span class="italic">Ipswich Times</span>; but, failing to make a success of journalism, he soon emigrated (almost certainly in late 1891) to the United States, where he spent almost a decade. He worked as a rancher and applied for naturalization, though he failed to complete the process after being cheated out of a homestead claim. He ended up taking journalistic jobs in San Francisco and St Louis before returning home (probably late in 1897, but possibly the following year).<br>
<br>After a short time in England, Lane moved in 1898 to Paris, where he spent fourteen years undertaking a variety of journalistic tasks. At first he worked on a long-established English-language newspaper, <span class="italic">Galignani's Messenger</span> (later the <span class="italic">Daily Messenger</span>), reviewed the English press for the <span class="italic">Eclair</span>, and also acted as a correspondent for American papers&#151;a combination of jobs which improved his facility as a writer and brought him modest prosperity. He acquired an option to purchase the ailing <span class="italic">Messenger</span>, and tried to interest Lord Northcliffe in financing it; but instead the latter persuaded him to become managing editor of a new continental edition of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, a position he held from 1905 until 1912.<br>
<br>For at least part of his time in Paris, Lane lived at 36 rue du Sentier with Beatrice Cuvellier (<i>d</i>. 1955), the daughter of a New Orleans lawyer, whom he had married either shortly before leaving the United States or soon after arriving in Paris. Lane came to regard his marriage as a disastrous mistake, informing Evelyn Wrench half a century later that he had entered into it &#145;for what seems to me now an absurd scruple&#146; and that, although he should have divorced Beatrice &#145;as soon as I discovered the nature of her previous life and the character formed by it&#146;, he had declined to do so for a number of reasons, &#145;among them the assurance by doctors that she would shortly be certified insane&#146;  (Marrin, 46). He apparently parted from her in 1912, dropped her from his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry the following year (though she remained in the American edition until he lapsed from it in the early 1920s), and omitted all reference to his marriage from his autobiography, though it seems that he did not legally separate from her until 1932 and supported her until her death. For the last fifty-five years of his life he lived alone, and was regarded by most of his acquaintances as a confirmed bachelor, an impression which his enthusiasm for the Boy Scout movement may have confirmed.<h2>
<a name="TheGreatIllusion"></a>The Great Illusion</h2>It was during his Paris years that Lane embarked on his career as a commentator on international relations. His experience of chauvinistic behaviour in Britain, the United States, and France, and his reading of Gustave Le Bon's <span class="italic">Psychologie des foules</span>, had led him to dispute J. A. Hobson's emphasis on financial influence as a cause of war and to insist instead on the role of non-economic factors such as the emotionalism of the mass mind. However, his book on this theme, <span class="italic">Patriotism under Three Flags</span>, published in 1903 under his baptismal name (Ralph Lane), had little impact.<br>
<br>Six years later Lane tried again, having become concerned less about mass emotions than about the economic complacency of the political &eacute;lites in both Britain and Germany, who seemed to assume that their naval rivalry could result in war without serious financial repercussions for both countries. In September 1909, using his middle names (Norman Angell) to conceal his identity as a Northcliffe employee, he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Europe's Optical Illusion</span>, to warn that &#145;the complex financial interdependence of the capitalists of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Europe's Optical Illusion</span>, 44) made even a successful war of conquest counter-productive because of the high costs of the attendant economic dislocation; and a year later he issued a book-length version under the title <span class="italic">The Great Illusion</span>. Though Lane was later embarrassed to discover how much of its argument had been anticipated by writers such as Novicow, whose work had not then been translated into English, this book became a best-seller, selling over a million copies, being translated into twenty-five languages, and transforming its author's life.<br>
<br>In addition to achieving celebrity as a peace pundit, Lane found himself in receipt of a steady stream of royalties and book contracts. By 1912 he felt able to become a full-time publicist: he left the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, adopted Norman Angell as his everyday identity, and acquired an apartment in London, first at 4 Tudor Street and then at 4 King's Bench Walk, Temple. (His wife apparently remained in the rue du Sentier.) He received administrative support from the Garton Foundation, a body set up for the purpose by the second Viscount Esher, who hoped his book might have a favourable effect on German attitudes, in collaboration with A. J. Balfour and the industrialist Sir Richard Garton: it helped to form International Polity and War and Peace clubs at several universities. In addition, an independent periodical, <span class="italic">War and Peace: A Norman Angell Monthly</span>, was launched in the autumn of 1913, though Angell did not edit it.<br>
<br>However, Angell's ideas had given rise to a movement partly because they were thought to offer reassurance at a time of growing international tension, and a widespread belief developed that his thesis was that war was no longer possible. Although some of his own statements encouraged this interpretation, it was a misreading of <span class="italic">The Great Illusion</span>, and became extremely embarrassing for him after the outbreak of the First World War. He spent much of his life trying to rehabilitate his reputation on this point, justifying his acceptance of a knighthood in 1931 as a belated contribution to his exoneration. However, he eventually came to realize that his book suffered from another and more serious defect which had been generally overlooked by critics&#151;its failure to ask: &#145;How shall a political truth, once established, be translated into workable policy?&#146;  (Angell, 318).<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWarandinternationalism"></a>The First World War and internationalism</h2>Forced by the 1914 crisis to attempt such a translation, Angell showed himself to be emotionally and intellectually torn both between isolationism and internationalism, and between left-wing ideas and orthodox liberalism. At first isolationism and leftism prevailed: on 28 July 1914 he formed an abortive Neutrality League; and after Britain's declaration of war he co-operated with a group of isolationist radicals to launch the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95108', "Union of Democratic Control")</script> (UDC). However, by the end of 1914&#151;apparently after a brief spell as a stretcher-bearer in France&#151;he was arguing that the war had to be won, and noting that the wartime alliance against Germany and Austria offered a possible model for a future international organization.<br>
<br>After crossing the Atlantic in the spring of 1915 and making contact with circles close to President Wilson, Angell came to doubt whether, in view of German attacks on neutral shipping, genuine neutrality was possible even for the United States. On 31 May he published an article in the American magazine <span class="italic">New Republic</span> suggesting that the United States and certain other neutrals join with the allies in &#145;an international control of the world's supplies for the purpose of withholding them from Germany&#146;, which might prove to be &#145;the beginnings of the world organization of our common resources&#146;  (reprinted in <span class="italic">War and Peace</span>, September 1915, 185&#150;6). Despite his recent neutralism he was thus beginning to see the war as potentially a means of reforming the international system.<br>
<br>However, as an ambitious public figure with the common touch, Angell could also see himself returning to Britain to lead the peace campaign on which the Independent Labour Party was already embarking. Indeed, when the Garton Foundation finally severed its connection with him in October 1915, he toyed briefly with the idea of a &#145;straight-out anti-militarist campaign among the more revolutionary of the Labour people&#151;with a possible capture of the ILP&#146;, even though aware that this &#145;would amount virtually to a preaching of non-resistance&#146;  (Hafer, fol. 161), a policy he had previously repudiated. To the relief of most of his closest associates, he resisted this temptation to plunge into socialist and pacifist politics, and with conscription imminent returned to Britain to offer himself for military service. On being turned down he returned to America, though the British government briefly denied him a passport, because it was embarrassed by an article which he had tried to send to the <span class="italic">New Republic</span> claiming that American help to Britain already went beyond the bounds of neutrality. He remained in the United States for the rest of the war, advocating the creation of an international organization (and thereby, it has been claimed, contributing to President Wilson's espousal of this cause) but not taking a leading part in the movement for a league of nations.<h2>
<a name="LeftturnLabourMP"></a>Left turn: Labour MP</h2>When the armistice came, Angell returned to Paris to cover the peace conference. Disillusioned by what he saw, and not greatly enthused by the league as it was to be constituted, he moved some way back towards his former isolationism and&#151;albeit in much less controversial circumstances&#151;made the left-wing commitment which had tempted him in the autumn of 1915. He returned to King's Bench Walk, attacked the Versailles treaty in terms similar to Keynes, who praised his efforts, and helped launch a Fight the Famine Council. He felt that European conditions justified his prediction of the consequences of war, and in 1921 published <span class="italic">The Fruits of Victory: a Sequel to &#145;The Great Illusion&#146;</span>, in which he argued that as &#145;interdependence increases, the limits of coercion are narrowed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Fruits of Victory</span>, 7), thereby implying that French attempts to enforce Versailles would be counterproductive. He also joined the Labour Party, being adopted as a parliamentary candidate for the Ruschliffe division of Nottinghamshire in 1920, though failing to win it at the general election of 1922 or Rossendale at that of 1923. Perhaps in an attempt to increase his credibility as a socialist politician he began making remarks in the early 1920s which implied a personal sympathy for a policy of non-resistance.<br>
<br>However, even during this &#145;left turn&#151;with doubts&#146;, as he was to call it in his autobiography  (Angell, 3), Angell avoided the extremes of isolationism and hostility to France and the League of Nations which characterized many of his Labour colleagues, most notably his UDC co-founder E. D. Morel. For example, at the time of the first Labour government in 1924 Angell tried unsuccessfully to persuade the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, another UDC co-founder, of the merits of the draft treaty of mutual assistance, an attempt to strengthen the league and thereby reassure France, which was on that account anathema to much of the left; and in 1925 he joined the executive committee of the League of Nations Union, which was in need of Labour members.<br>
<br>In the mid-1920s Angell bought Northey Island in the Blackwater estuary, Essex, as a country retreat, from where he continued to produce frequent articles and books, which were sometimes repetitive and rarely based on sources more substantial than the press cuttings which he accumulated in his house and for which he had an uncritical regard. In 1928 he took on the editorship of the UDC's journal <span class="italic">Foreign Affairs</span>, though it folded in 1931. In 1929, at the third attempt, he entered parliament, as the member for Bradford North, but did not enjoy the experience and, being sympathetic to his old associate MacDonald, who had recently given him a knighthood, stood down in the general election which followed the formation of the National Government in 1931. Although he loyally agreed to be Labour candidate for the London University seat in 1935, safe in the knowledge he was not expected to campaign and had no prospect of winning, he drifted back to his original ideological attachment: by 1940 he was privately admitting to Gilbert Murray that, &#145;having tried to make the best of all the Socialist slogans and Marxist incantations, I have been pushed more and more to the conviction that it is your type of Liberalism which alone can save us&#146;  (Murray MSS).<h2>
<a name="Nobelpeaceprize"></a>Nobel peace prize</h2>After leaving parliament Angell returned to the life of the independent foreign-policy commentator, and gradually developed into a stalwart member of the League of Nations Union. In 1933 he defended the legitimacy of international force against aggression, while insisting&#151;presumably in an effort to win the sympathies of those whose initial reaction to Hitler's coming to power was to protest against any repeat of British involvement in the First World War&#151;that in his personal views he remained a pacifist. In 1934 he was belatedly awarded the Nobel peace prize for the previous year after an energetic campaign by his friends to overcome the view of some European intellectuals that his work was superficial and derivative. During the Abyssinia crisis of 1935&#150;6&#151;understandably, in view of the fact that a central argument of <span class="italic">The Great Illusion</span> had been that additional territory did not bring with it additional prosperity&#151;he became a leading critic of the Italian claim that the acquisition of colonies could solve the problems of a &#145;have not&#146; nation. He supported collective security and rearmament, and by 1937 had become so alarmed at the National Government's apparent willingness to make concessions to Hitler, even at the cost of British imperial strength, that he published <span class="italic">The Defence of the Empire</span>, justifying his apparent abandonment of the view that colonial possessions brought no advantage to their owner by insisting he was now concerned with the preservation of order rather than, as formerly, with material benefits only. He was in touch with the small group of supporters which Winston Churchill described as his &#145;focus&#146;: in 1938 he was involved in its purchase of the League of Nations Union's periodical <span class="italic">Headway</span> in an effort to enhance its influence as a critic of appeasement.<br>
<br>Forced to leave Northey Island in the invasion scare of 1940, Angell moved to the United States with government blessing. He resided at 501 West 113th Street, New York, where he remained for a decade, doing his best through his writings to encourage strong Anglo-American relations. In 1951, the year in which he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">After All</span>, he returned to England, living at the Stone Cottage, Fernden Hill, Haslemere, Surrey. He continued to write, taking the Western side on cold war issues, supporting the Suez invasion, and managing a two-month tour of the United States at the age of ninety, but regretting the diminution in the public attention paid to his views.<br>
<br>Not much over 5 feet tall, with a spare frame, broad forehead, penetrating blue-grey eyes, and a high-pitched voice, Angell was liable to insomnia, headaches, and moodiness, but relaxed through yachting, and was generally held in affection by those who encountered him. He died in a nursing home at 33 Birdhurst Road, Croydon, on 7 October 1967.<br>
