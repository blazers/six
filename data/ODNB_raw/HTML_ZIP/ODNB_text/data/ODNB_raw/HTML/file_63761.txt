<span class="headword">Cowdroy,  William</span>  (1752&#150;1814), <span class="occ">playwright and radical publisher</span>, is of obscure origins; details of his parentage and upbringing are unknown. He was apprenticed to John Monk, the printer of the tory <span class="italic">Chester Courant</span>, on 6 June 1764, and enrolled on 21 June 1770. He became a freeman of the city on 24 July 1777. He was probably already on the staff of the <span class="italic">Chester Chronicle</span> when its editor, John Fletcher, was imprisoned for libelling the recorder of Chester in 1785. Cowdroy thereafter assumed the editorship. It is likely that his <span class="italic">Directory and Guide for the County and City of Chester</span> (1789) was published from the same offices.<br>
<br>As a young man Cowdroy had dabbled in amateur acting, and once apprenticed he gave comic lectures, using masks, such as &#145;Lectures on Heads&#146; in the manner of George Alexander Stevens. He enjoyed some success as a playwright, publishing <span class="italic">The Vaporish Man, or, Hypocrisy Detected</span> (1782), performed at theatres in Chester and Manchester, and sold by booksellers as distant as Shrewsbury. This was followed by the comic opera <span class="italic">Love Conquers All, or, The Cheshire Knight Outwitted</span> (<i>c</i>.1786), which was managed by Joseph Munden in its first production at Chester.<br>
<br>Moving to Greengate, Salford, in 1794, Cowdroy became the partner of Thomas Boden, the Manchester bookseller and printer already noted for publishing the proceedings of the trial of the Manchester radical Thomas Walker (1794). Together they published Thomas Battye's <span class="italic">The Red Basil Book</span> (1797). While this pamphlet caused some embarrassment for the town's &#145;principal inhabitants&#146;, it was Cowdroy's association with Battye which was more revealing, especially as the Manchester cotton merchant and government spy, Robert Gray, was to describe Battye as a United Englishman and very dangerous, often heard damning the king.<br>
<br>Cowdroy, with Boden, already enjoyed some notoriety as publisher of the radical <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette and Weekly Advertiser</span>, a successor to Walker's <span class="italic">Manchester Herald</span> (1792&#150;3), and one of a relatively small number of titles to appear after the Pitt administration's crackdown on the radical movement. The first issue of the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> appeared on 21 November 1795, bearing the motto:&#145;Be Temperate in Political Disquisition. Give Free Operation to Truth&#146;. Its agenda included objecting to the war with France, to increased taxation, and to the repressive measures of the government. The newspaper boasted that it was &#145;extensively circulated&#146; as far as Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and London.<br>
<br>In 1798 Cowdroy's son, also William, was incriminated on the evidence of Gray, who had acted as an <i>agent provocateur</i> by making a down payment at his publishing works for the printing of radical literature. Among the materials published were <span class="italic">Declarations, Resolutions, and Constitution of the Society of United Englishmen</span>, and <span class="italic">Loyalty and Reason</span>. Gray had also attempted to ensnare Cowdroy senior, whose name, with Boden's, appeared on a government list of &#145;three printers&#146;. Gray paid him at least one visit, and asked for a subscription for the United Irishman James O'Coigley's passage to France. Cowdroy donated 2<i>s</i>. While this proved insufficient ground for prosecution, his republican leanings were not in doubt. In his conversations with Thomas Jowell, a United Englishman secretary, he expressed his belief that, if the minds of the people could be cultivated, they would revolutionize themselves. England was, for Cowdroy, a country where &#145;priestcraft&#146; was suffered and the Christian religion frightened people into obedience. An apocryphal tale also related Cowdroy's insistence at his fourth son's baptism, that the child be named Citizen.<br>
<br>Cowdroy died in Manchester on 13 August 1814, and was buried in St Mark's churchyard, Cheetham Hill, Manchester. At that time his publishing business was sufficiently lucrative for him to leave an estate worth up to &pound;600, out of which his wife Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1821), about whom further details are unknown, received an annuity of &pound;150. He had parted company with Boden in August 1799, and been left in full control of the <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>. Thereafter, Sarah, with William junior, assumed control of the newspaper, sales of which rallied until the 1820s with the arrival of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Cowdroy and his wife had three other sons, Thomas, Benjamin, and Citizen Howard, all of whom became printers, and two daughters Mary Eliza and Caroline.<br>
