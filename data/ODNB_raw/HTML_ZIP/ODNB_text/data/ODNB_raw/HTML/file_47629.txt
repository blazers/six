<span class="headword">Freeman,  Thomas Birch</span>  (1809&#150;1890), <span class="occ">missionary and colonial official</span>, was born on 6 December 1809 at Twyford, near Winchester, of an African father, Thomas Freeman, a farmer, and an English mother, Amy Birch. He adopted the name Freeman in youth, perhaps from his father who may have been a freed slave. Little is known of his upbringing except that it was in poverty, or of his education, save that he could write with elegance.<br>
<br>As a young man Freeman rose to become head gardener and botanist to Sir Robert Harland at Orwell Park, near Ipswich. Freeman joined the Wesleyan Methodists, became a lay preacher, and lost his employment for refusing to return to the Church of England. He thereupon volunteered as a Methodist missionary to west Africa, where the first white missionaries had all died within weeks of arrival. Freeman's offer was thus welcomed, in the false belief that as an African he was racially protected against tropical diseases. On 17 October 1837 he married Elizabeth Boote, housekeeper to his former employer; she died of fever in February 1838, within weeks of their arrival on the Gold Coast. On 25 November 1840, while on his first leave in England, Freeman married Lucinda Cowan, daughter of a Methodist minister; she died on 25 August 1841, within seven months of landing in Africa. Some years later he married an educated African, who bore him a son, also named Thomas Birch Freeman.<br>
<br>Freeman was one of the most successful Christian missionaries of his age, founding the Methodist churches of the Gold Coast and Nigeria. His faith was transparently sincere and he was a skilled diplomat, who impressed both the British colonial representatives and rulers of African kingdoms; these included the powerful interior kingdom of Asante which he visited in 1840. His converts were looking for greater self-expression than their own societies permitted; Methodism allowed Freeman to place literate Africans as lay preachers and ministers, thus spreading the organization of the church rapidly. In 1842 he visited Badagri in south-west Nigeria, and then Abeokuta, where large numbers of slaves liberated by the Royal Navy were returning home, who proved fertile soil for conversion. From 1842 he supervised an expanding number of Methodist congregations in the Gold Coast and Nigeria, visited the kingdom of Dahomey in 1843 when it threatened Abeokuta and Badagri, and made further visits to Asante in 1848 with the British governor of the Gold Coast.<br>
<br>Freeman's very success as an evangelist led to his resignation in 1857, for he was na&iuml;ve in his financial administration, expecting that God would provide funds for each expansion. An accounting in 1857 revealed that while Freeman had been scrupulously honest he had presided over chaotic finances. He was at once given employment by the colonial government as civil commandant of Accra district, and he remained in the colonial service for the next sixteen years. In 1873 he returned to the Methodist ministry in a purely pastoral role, retiring in 1885 to live in Accra. He died in the Methodist mission circuit house there, in his eighty-first year, on 12 August 1890.<br>
