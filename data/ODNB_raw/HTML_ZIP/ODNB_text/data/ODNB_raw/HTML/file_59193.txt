<span class="headword">Gyles,  Margaret Alethea</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Althea Gyles]</span>  (1868&#150;1949), <span class="occ">artist and poet</span>, was born in Kilmurry, co. Cork, Ireland, the daughter of &#145;mad&#146; George Gyles and his wife, Alithea Emma, daughter of the Hon. and Revd Edward Grey, bishop of Hereford. Her family, from Minehead, Somerset, had settled in Youghal about 1649, and was &#145;so haughty that their neighbours called them the Royal family&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 237).<br>
<br>Severing herself from her family and surviving by &#145;selling her watch, and then by occasional stories in an [unidentified] Irish paper&#146;, Gyles attended an art school in Stephen's Green, Dublin, in the late 1880s. Living in poor accommodation and starving, she was taken by E. J. Dick to live in the &#145;household&#146;, a theosophical commune at 3 Ely Place, which included his wife and George Russell (A. E.). To W. B. Yeats, who joined them in 1891, she seemed &#145;a strange red-haired girl, all whose thoughts were set upon painting and poetry&#146;. Quarrelling with the Dicks, she returned to &#145;starvation and misery [which] had a large share in her ritual of worship&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 237&#150;8).<br>
<br>At 53 Mountpleasant Square, Dublin, Gyles wrote a never-published novel, &#145;The woman without a soul&#146; (MS, NL Ire.). Its black magician is loosely based on the mysterious Captain Roberts whose rituals involving animal sacrifice are described in &#145;The Sorcerers&#146;, in Yeats's <span class="italic">The Celtic Twilight</span> (1893). Late in 1891 or early in 1892 Gyles moved to London where she studied at Pedders, then at the Slade School, financed by one of her Grey relatives. By 1896 she had established herself in her &#145;studio&#146; at 86 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square. Her friends included Lady Colin Campbell, art critic of <span class="italic">The World</span> (Gyles almost certainly providing the cover design for <span class="italic">A Woman's Walks</span>, 1903), and the artist Mabel Dearmer of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> circle. &#145;[S]huddering from her rustic surname&#146;, Oscar Wilde urged &#145;Ah! you must call yourself Althaea Le Gys&#146;  (Clifford Bax, ALS, U. Reading L.).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span> took Gyles's poem &#145;Dew-time&#146; in October 1894. It was influenced by A. E., illuminated by Gyles, and was followed by others derivative of Yeats and, from time to time, worked over by him. Her drawing <span class="italic">The Offering of Pan</span> appeared in <span class="italic">The Commonweal</span> in June 1896 and her illustration for T. W. Rolleston's <span class="italic">Deirdre: the Feis Ceoil Prize Cantata</span> in 1897. Gyles was not a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, but she and Yeats collaborated closely over the cabbalistic iconography of her wraparound design for <span class="italic">The Secret Rose</span> (1897), with its Celtic and medieval knotwork inspired by the eleventh-century sacramentary of Fleury attributed to Nivardus of Milan. Yeats analysed her work in &#145;A symbolic artist and the coming of symbolic art&#146; (<span class="italic">The Dome</span>, December 1898) and she was accepted again by A. H. Bullen, T. Fisher Unwin, Elkin Mathews, and Hodder and Stoughton, as she and Yeats collaborated on programmes for talismanic designs to his &#145;total books&#146;, <span class="italic">The Wind Among the Reeds</span> and <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1899). The spinal design of the latter was used until 1927.<br>
<br>Aleister Crowley claims to have witnessed Yeats, with Gyles, attempting an astral vision of a red and white hawk and deer in his rooms at Woburn Buildings. Crowley told Richard Ellmann in 1946 that when Gyles sought to save herself from his insidious aura, Yeats ordered her to obtain a drop of Crowley's blood so that Yeats might overcome black magic with white. She compromised on a hair from his head and one of his books, which she dropped as she fled when Crowley confronted her with a skeleton in his <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>. Yeats used the hair for his invocations, and Crowley wrestled with a &#145;vampire for ten nights&#146;  (McFarlin Library, University of Tulsa, Richard Ellmann papers). Ellmann relates that Gyles then &#145;gave way entirely to [Crowley's] baleful fascination&#146;, but Crowley was perhaps remembering only his fictional characters Count Swanoff (himself), Hypatia Gay (Althea), and Will Bute (Yeats) in his short story &#145;At the Fork of the Roads&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Equinox</span> (1909).<br>
<br>In Paris early in May 1899 Gyles agreed to illustrate Wilde's <span class="italic">The Harlot's House</span> for the publisher, pornographer, and patron of Aubrey Beardsley, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47447/', "Leonard Smithers (1861&#150;1907)")</script>. Soon they were caught up in an ostentatious affair. She executed five coloured drawings which Smithers described as &#145;weirdly powerful and beautiful&#146; and eventually published in the pirate edition in 1904  (Sherard, 342). At the height of her energies, postponing all other work to finish the illustrations for <span class="italic">The Harlot's House</span>, she was plainly in love with &#145;so <i>excellent</i> a person as Mr Smithers&#146;  (Finneran and others, 56). Martin Secker would often see them playing chess in the domino room at the Caf&eacute; Royal. The gold-stamped covers for Ernest Dowson's <span class="italic">Decorations</span> followed in December 1899, using a stylized rose, which Yeats identified as her &#145;central symbol&#146;, on the white parchment top board, and a pattern of thorns and foliage on the back. Four swirling birds pecking at a heart between a sun and moon surrounded by stars form the top board of John White-Rodyng's <span class="italic">The Night</span> (1900).<br>
<br>By November 1899 Gyles had deposited her valuable books with W. B. Yeats&#151;he refused Smithers's &#145;improper Japanese ivories&#146;&#151;before the bailiffs arrived. In mid-September 1900 Arthur Symons found her in bed in a bare room at 15 Granby Place, Hampstead Road, &#145;without a thing in the place, except five books (one a presentation copy from Oscar Wilde) and one or two fantastic gold ornaments which she used to wear; chloral by her side, and the bed strewn with MSS&#146;, wanting to read his article on Ernest Dowson. Dowson had died on 23 February 1900 but she told Symons &#145;When I meet him I'll tell him about it!&#146; Symons sold her poem &#145;For a Sepulchre&#146; to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. Gyles, recovering in the Hospital for Diseases of the Chest in the City Road, apologized to the bankrupt Smithers for not raising money from her people to save him. Back in Granby Place by Wilde's death on 30 November, she offered Smithers &pound;6 to go to Wilde's funeral. He refused.<br>
<br>Faith Compton Mackenzie portrayed Gyles and her relationship with Smithers in <span class="italic">Tatting</span> (1957). Gyles appeared as Ariadne Berden who:<blockquote>after treating reasonable admirers with prudish contempt, had fallen into the arms of an abominable creature of high intelligence, no morals and the vivid imagination which was perhaps what she had been waiting for &hellip; Ariadne lost caste, and when the affair ended after more than a year of heady intoxication, and with a certain amount of inspired work, she collapsed. (F. C. Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Tatting</span>, 1957, 12)</blockquote>For Symons, Smithers was &#145;a drunken brute whom no one could stand&#146; who had &#145;left her as soon as he had alienated her other friends&#146;  (Columbia University, Arthur Symons papers).<br>
<br>By 1902 Gyles was once again ill, but survived to tell untrustworthy &#145;romantic tales of her night escape from a terrible sanitorium&#146;  (Symons, 167). Her productive life as a designer was over. Her cover design for <span class="italic">The Shadowy Waters</span> (1900) uses only the rose from her rejected frontispiece portrait of Yeats for <span class="italic">The Wind Among the Reeds</span> (her only surviving original work, now in the British Museum), and while her spinal design from <span class="italic">The Secret Rose</span> is reused on the 1902 edition of <span class="italic">The Celtic Twilight</span> it is unclear whether she executed the small gold emblem on the top board (three fletched arrows pointing through a crescent moon). Her front and rear cover designs for <span class="italic">The Wind Among the Reeds</span> were redrawn when full vellum bindings were produced in 1903, but it is unlikely that she redrew them herself. Yeats refused her spinal designs on several books.<br>
<br>Gyles continued intermittently to publish verse in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Candid Friend</span>, and <span class="italic">The Kensington</span>, <span class="italic">The Venture</span>, <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, <span class="italic">Orpheus</span>, and <span class="italic">The Vineyard</span>, organ of the Peasant Art Guild at Haslemere. Her close friend and patron Cecil French, who bought her fine portrait of Yeats, recalled her &#145;considerable reputation around 1900. She was a most difficult being with noble qualities, who invariably became the despair of those who had helped her.&#146; French also records that her projected collection of verses was &#145;at one time actually in type (I saw it). She flatly refused to correct the proofs, saying the effort would kill her; nor was anyone else allowed to correct the proofs. The publisher was not pleased&#146;  (U. Reading L.). Typescripts of her verses survive in A. H. Bullen's archive in Stratford.<br>
<br>Arthur Symons, however, claimed that he had introduced her to a London publisher who was happy with her verses but rejected the dedication she insisted on: &#145;To the beautiful memory of Oscar Wilde&#146;. In 1904 Thomas B. Mosher, the pirate publisher, rejected the poems pressed on him on behalf of the &#145;quite unmanageable and unpractical&#146; author  (Symons, 171&#150;2). Her last book cover may well be that of Arthur Humphrey's Wilde anthology, <span class="italic">Sebastian Melmoth</span> (1905). In March 1907 she was &#145;comparatively prosperous&#146;, writing:<blockquote>art notes for Frank Harris, and reviewing novels. She even does an occasional drawing, and has never been known to look upon the world with so little malice. She has quite a group of friends, but changes them completely every six months. (Yeats, 2 March 1907, Berg Collection, NYPL)</blockquote>Yeats affirms that by 1908 she had ended a love affair by reading Browning to her lover in the middle of the night  (Wade, 511). Faith and Compton Mackenzie visited her in Paradise Walk, Chelsea, where she was living in &#145;an atmosphere of squalid poverty&#146;, spending her time &#145;lying upon a broken-down truckle-bed&#146;, an episode which finds its way into <span class="italic">Tatting</span>, where the room is adorned with a Beardsley &#145;solitary on the whitewashed wall, a delicious riot of satyrs and fauns&#146;  (F. C. Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Tatting</span>, 1957, 97&#150;8). Compton Mackenzie invited her to Cornwall in May 1908:<blockquote>She looked rather like a part of the decorations of a harvest festival which had been caught up unwittingly by one of the congregation and dragged outside. Her large-brimmed black hat was wreathed with poppies; her green silk dress hung upon her &hellip; Her cheeks, no doubt once rosy and bloomed with youth, were now pale; her hair, no doubt once autumn-gold, was now dead as a faded rug; her pale blue eyes lacked lustre &hellip; In a tiny cottage she was an intolerable nuisance. (Mackenzie, octave 4, 36&#150;9)</blockquote>In February 1906 Gyles had offered Grant Richards an &#145;alphabet&#146; which she was designing, &#145;The alphabet of the wonderful wood&#146;, but it was one of many projects never completed  (University of Texas, Ransom HRC). Beginning with the letter U, she painted &#145;an entrancing water-colour of a very white unicorn against a very blue sky, and did no more&#146;. Eleanor Farjeon, who occasionally typed her poems, thought her &#145;quite exquisitely gifted, as a writer and an artist; with the sort of temperament that stood in her own light&#146;, she was &#145;fascinating and exhausting&#146;, and &#145;filled the air with fantastic talk and anecdotes on the &#147;nineties&#148;&#146;. Her hands were the most beautiful Farjeon had ever seen but &#145;quite the dirtiest&#146;  (letter, U. Reading L.)<br>
<br>In 1914, as John Meade, Gyles published <span class="italic">Letters to Children about Drawing, Painting, and Something More</span>. She continued to write, paint, drift, be ill, and to gravitate towards small arts and crafts or religious communities (such as the Order of the Holy Mount, Folkestone), supported by increasingly disgruntled patrons including Clifford Bax, who thought her a parasite. Urged by Grant Richards to write her memoirs of the 1890s, she wrote a novel, <span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, in Folkestone about 1919, which Richards rejected in February 1921. The characters include Pascoe, an Irish theosophist, mystic folklorist, and painter (George Russell), and Benador Quested, a dark-eyed mystical poet and animal lover (Yeats) who runs a donkey sanctuary in Devon (MS, U. Reading L.). In January 1924 Richards was still asking her for her memoirs. In the 1930s Eleanor Farjeon had a &#145;sudden wild letter&#146; from her. She was living in a Brixton basement, in an &#145;awful state&#146; with a big mongrel dog  (U. Reading L.). Her last address was 19 Tredown Road, Lewisham, where she lived in a room empty but for a chaise longue, some bric-&agrave;-brac, and the manuscripts now in the University of Reading. She died on 23 January 1949 in a nursing home at 69 Crystal Palace Park Road, Beckenham, Kent, leaving &pound;611 1<i>s</i>.<br>
