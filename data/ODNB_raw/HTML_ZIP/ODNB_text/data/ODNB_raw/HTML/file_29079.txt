<span class="headword">West, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1782, <em>d.</em> 1828), <span class="occ">judge and political economist</span>, was baptized on 5 April 1782 at St Marylebone, Middlesex, the son of John Balchen West, the receiver-general for Hertfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. His parents died early in his life, and he was brought up by his uncle Sir Martin Brown ffolkes (<i>d</i>. 1821), MP for King's Lynn in Norfolk, and his aunt Fanny Turner (<i>d</i>. 1813), daughter of Sir John Turner bt of Warham. He was educated at Harrow School and University College, Oxford, where he obtained his BA in 1804. Between 1804 and 1807 he studied classics and mathematics, and was elected a fellow in 1807. He then turned to the law, and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1814. He wrote the <span class="italic">Essay on the Application of Capital to Land</span> (1815) as a contribution to the early corn law debates, then in 1817 published a legal work, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Law and Practice of Extents</span>. This was a reforming work addressed to indemnities against direct or indirect debts to royalty, and their use in the court of chancery. West was appointed recorder of Bombay in 1822, and following customary practice was knighted. He married his first cousin Lucretia G. B. ffolkes at Marylebone church on 26 August 1822, and they left for India six months later. They were never to return to Britain, and both in 1828 fell to the fate of so many aspiring young professionals seeking to make careers in India, that of an early death.<br>
<br>Soon after he arrived in Bombay, West was appointed chief justice of the crown, or one of the king's judges appointed to act as a check on the East India Company and to protect the interests of the Indian people. The role was a difficult one, as most of the European community in Bombay was connected to the East India Company. Despite his isolation he took his position seriously, and set out to check corruption, and to take up in the courts grievances of Indian servants and labourers against their masters. He wrote reports and letters, and made speeches on native legal rights, on the failings of the company magistrates, and on the irregularities of the police magistrates. He died before his reforms could be implemented, and was replaced by a chief justice seen to favour the company.<br>
<br>Lucretia West, an educated woman of the lesser gentry, took great interest in the politics of the day. Before her marriage she canvassed for her brother for the seat of Lynn in Norfolk against Colonel Walpole. Her journals in Bombay recounted her husband's long sessions in court, in the intervals of which he worked on his tracts of political economy, first on <span class="italic">The Price of Corn and Wages of Labour</span> (1826), then on a treatise which was never completed. She vividly set out the day-to-day lives of the British middle classes in India in her account of their own problems of adaptation. She described their friendships, the social ostracism they encountered during West's reform of legal practice in Bombay, and the almost daily deaths among those they knew. She had a daughter, Fanny Anna, in June 1826 and just over two years later she died in childbirth in Bombay a few months after the death of her husband. Fanny Anna was taken back to Britain after the death of her parents, and on coming of age went to live at her parents' childhood home of Hillington Hall, Lynn.<br>
<br>Sir Edward West is remembered for proposing a theory of differential rent based on diminishing returns in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Essay on the Application of Capital to Land</span> (1815). This was published just before David Ricardo's <span class="italic">Essay on Profits</span> (1815) and virtually at the same time as Thomas Malthus's <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent</span> (1815). Ricardo in his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</span> (1817) attributed to both West and Malthus the &#145;true doctrine of rent&#146;. West's pamphlet was followed by a book in 1826, <span class="italic">The price of corn and wages of labour, with observations upon Dr. Smith's, Mr. Ricardo's and Mr. Malthus's doctrines upon those subjects</span>. West's contributions to political economy, though on a subject of enduring interest to him, were written in the interstices of a distinguished legal career, practised mainly in Bombay.<br>
<br>West's contributions to political economy were particularly striking for insights which so closely anticipated Ricardo's analysis, and for the intellectual isolation in which he appears to have written them. He argued the case for the principle of diminishing returns in much the same way as Ricardo was to do independently, and developed a theory of the falling rate of profit which might only be postponed by the repeal of the corn laws. West inferred from his theory of diminishing returns that rents would fall, with the result of universal benefit from free trade. Ricardo's <span class="italic">Essay on Profits</span> (1815), by contrast, argued that rents would fall, with the implication that landlords had a selfish interest in supporting the maintenance of the corn laws. West later changed his argument when he published <span class="italic">The Price of Corn</span> (1826). He did, however, take the debate on the corn laws to a new stage by arguing that there was no danger in free trade leading to extreme specialization between manufacturing and agricultural countries. Diminishing returns would apply as much to foreign food producers as it had to domestic, and so provide limits to international specialization.<br>
<br>West's <span class="italic">The Price of Corn and Wages of Labour</span> (1826), though written in India, was remarkably up to date in its deployment of recent accounts of distress in the British manufacturing districts. He used these to provide an alternative to Smithian, Malthusian, and Ricardian price and wage theory. West's was a demand theory, based in turn on the consumption of the manufacturing classes. Manufacturing, he argued, in becoming an increasingly dominant sector, was more subject to international price fluctuation. Those in the manufacturing districts were more subject to alternations of luxury and distress: &#145;at one time &hellip; the wives and daughters of journeymen used the most expensive articles of dress, such as silk stockings, etc; at other times &hellip; there were troops of the manufacturers wandering about the country for want of employment, ragged, apparently wasted from want of sufficient food&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Price of Corn and Wages of Labour</span>, 50). The division between luxuries and necessities also affected demand; the demand for necessaries might be tied to the level of wages and incomes; that for luxuries was also dependent on the vagaries of taste. With the international division of labour the price uncertainties experienced in luxury markets now extended to all markets. Yet, just as he argued in <span class="italic">Essay on the Application of Capital to Land</span> (1815), the adverse impact of this international specialization would be checked, in this case by the proliferation of markets, and reduced dependence on any single market.<br>
<br>West drew on his experience in India. He argued that the low rates of wages in India might entail lower production costs and prices, but not necessarily so. The higher productivity, and especially intensity of labour in Britain yielded even lower production costs  (<span class="italic">The Price of Corn and Wages of Labour</span>, 71). He also drew attention to the uncertainties of international markets from India to South America, predicting, however, greater stability with more international integration  (ibid., 141). Writing from the extremities of the empire, West developed a much more global perspective than many contemporary political economists on the determinants of prices and wages. He died at Poona on 18 August 1828, and was buried there. Hindus, Parsis, and Muslims combined to fund a scholarship in West's honour.<br>
