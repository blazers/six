<span class="headword">Llwyd,  Huw <span class="st"> [Hugh]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1568&#150;<em>c.</em>1630), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet and soldier</span>, was the third son of eight children born to Dafydd Llwyd ap Howel and his wife, Catrin. According to an elegy by Huw Machno the father died in 1623, and by then Huw Llwyd was his heir. Huw Llwyd is almost invariably associated with Cynfal Fawr, a farmhouse in the parish of Maentwrog in Merioneth. He served in a regiment in the English army, probably under the command of Roger Williams. He composed an <i>englyn</i> (a four-line strict-metre verse) describing the victuals he tasted in England, France, and the Netherlands. Machno's elegy suggests that Llwyd settled in Cynfal after campaigning overseas.<br>
<br>Llwyd married the daughter of Hendre Mur (also referred to as Mur Castell), a farmhouse within 1 mile of Cynfal. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16869/', "Morgan Llwyd (1619&#150;1659)")</script>, a famous Welsh author, may have been Llwyd's grandson, or even his son. Llwyd probably built part of the house that is today known as Cynfal Fawr. He mentions one peculiarity of the house, namely that water flowed &#145;brightly&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Welsh e10, 8) through its parlour.<br>
<br>In a poem of 1630 Huw Machno describes Huw Llwyd's Cynfal. He refers to Llwyd's dividing the house more skilfully and turning the water through the parlour. The poem also gives a fascinating insight into Huw Llwyd's interests by listing the contents of his room. There he had his books, his ointment boxes, his &#145;doctor's gear&#146;, his buckler and sword, his yew bow and quiver of arrows, cage, gun, flask, fishing rod, hunting horn and hunting staff, nets, his spying glass, and chess and draughts sets  (Davies, xviii). The soldier's accoutrements are here, clearly enough. Then there are his ointment boxes and doctor's gear: add to this his work on &#145;old natural remedies&#146;  (NL Wales, Peniarth MS 123) and it can be understood why he had a reputation as a sorcerer and why stories about his &#145;magic&#146; powers are found to this day in his locality.<br>
<br>Then there is Llwyd's hunting and fishing gear. It comes as no surprise to learn that Huw Llwyd composed a number of poems related to hunting. There is his poem in response to <i>englynion</i> composed by Morys Berwyn on behalf of Owen Elis to ask for two hounds, and his poem addressed to Thomas Prys of Plas Iolyn asking for a couple of hounds:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">which draw in the sweet air<br>
</div>
<div>through their jowls as the fair babble of beautiful bells.<br>
</div> (NL Wales, MS 12731, 53&#150;4)</blockquote>His best-known poems are two that he composed to &#145;The Fox&#146;. In the first of these the poet addresses the fox, describes him, and is then advised by him about the way of the world. The advice given is cynical, pessimistic, and Machiavellian:<blockquote>
<div>and today, he who lives an honest life<br>
</div>
<div>is, in the world's reckoning, a fool.<br>
</div> (Parry, 242&#150;3)</blockquote>He explains that it is only by doing evil that a man may prosper. Llwyd's second poem to the same fox is a very different poem. By now the fox is old and weary, and is plagued by a bad conscience. He tells the poet that the best treasure of all is a &#145;good conscience&#146;  (NL Wales, Llanstephan MSS 133, 243a).<br>
<br>It is unfortunate that these two poems cannot be dated, but the second was obviously composed later than the first. Does that indicate that Llwyd had attained some kind of religious conviction? Or were the two poems, by original intent, meant for moral instruction? It is interesting to note that one of Morgan Llwyd's constant obsessions was man's good conscience: is the fact that his father, or grandfather, also felt, probably later on in his life, that nothing could be compared to a good conscience mere coincidence? Not many poems are attributed to Llwyd, but most of the other&#151;short&#151;poems that he may have composed are meditations on death, and man's service to God. It appears as if Llwyd's early exuberance as a poet later gave way to a more meditative and religious turn of mind.<br>
