<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Malton,  Thomas, the elder</span>  (1726&#150;1801), <span class="occ">architectural draughtsman and writer on geometry</span>, began his career as an upholsterer in the Strand, London. He exhibited two drawings of St Martin's Church with the Free Society of Artists in 1761 and others with the Society of Artists in 1766 and 1768; from 1772 to 1785 he showed perspective drawings at the newly established Royal Academy. In 1774 he published <span class="italic">The Royal Road to Geometry, or, An Easy and Familiar Introduction to the Mathematics</span>, a school book intended as an improvement on Euclid, and in 1775 <span class="italic">A complete treatise on perspective in theory and practice, on the principles of Dr. Brook Taylor</span>. He also lectured on these subjects, having moved to a house in Poland Street, Soho. On 2 March 1776 a fire in the Savoy destroyed 350 copies of the book on geometry and 200 of that on perspective; Malton was sued by his printer and paper merchant and from this point his financial troubles seem to have begun. In 1785 he moved with his family to Dublin, a city with which he already had some acquaintance, where he struggled to support himself by teaching perspective, and where he died on 18 February 1801. Examples of his work are to be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum; the Witt collection at the Courtauld Institute holds a very fine, if incomplete, perspective drawing of Temple Bar in the Strand with the houses on either side of the thoroughfare.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_17903"></a><span class="headword">James Malton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">architectural draughtsman and author</span>, accompanied his father to Dublin, where he found employment in the office of the distinguished architect James Gandon, despite a suspicion that the elder Malton had anonymously published severe criticism of Gandon's designs for the Royal Exchange in Dublin. After three years, however, James Malton &#145;so frequently betrayed all official confidence, and was guilty of so many irregularities that it became quite necessary to dismiss him from employment&#146;  (Gandon, 67). Subsequently Gandon suspected that Malton was responsible for <span class="italic">Letters Addressed to Parliament</span> (1787), which expressed hostile views on the architect's work, but the authorship was not proved.<br>
<br>In the 1790s James Malton returned to London, where he supported himself as a topographical artist, exhibiting some fifty-one drawings, designs for, and elevations of buildings at the Royal Academy between 1792 and 1803. From 1794 his address was 17 Norton Street (later Bolsover Street), Portland Place. In 1797 he published a handsome volume of illustrations with text, <span class="italic">A Descriptive View of Dublin</span>. In the following year he published <span class="italic">An Essay on British Cottage Architecture</span> (which went into a second edition in 1804) and in 1802 <span class="italic">A Collection of Designs for Rural Retreats</span>, which was attacked by R. Elsam in his <span class="italic">Essay on Rural Architecture</span> of 1803. These two works of Malton's have aquatint illustrations of an exceptionally high quality and delicacy. Malton's importance as a pioneer of the <i>cottage orn&eacute;</i> has been recognized.<br>
<br>James Malton died at his home in Norton Street on 28 July 1803 from brain fever and was buried in Marylebone churchyard. The brief notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> describes him as &#145;an ingenious and distinguished artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 73/2, 1803, 791). The contents of his studio and his effects were auctioned at Christies on 8 and 9 March 1804. In addition to many original drawings for his various publications, several lots consisted of apparatus and models apparently relating to his father's work on perspective. There are good examples of James Malton's work in the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the British Museum, and two interesting designs in the drawings collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), for a hunting-lodge and a villa &#145;in the Norman style&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17905"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Malton the younger</span>  (1751/2&#150;1804), <span class="occ">architectural draughtsman</span>, son of Thomas Malton the elder, joined his father about 1790 in Dublin, where his portrait was painted handsomely by the American Gilbert Stuart; the original can no longer be traced, but it was engraved by W. W. Barney and copies are to be found in the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, London. Before his departure for Ireland, he had, in 1774, won a premium from the Society of Arts and had exhibited at the Society of Artists, the Free Society of Artists, and the Royal Academy, where in 1782 he was awarded a gold medal; between 1773 and 1803 he showed at the Royal Academy no fewer than 128 drawings, paintings, and designs of streets and buildings in London, Oxford, and Cambridge and of various mansions in the home counties, East Anglia, Yorkshire, and Bath. Between 1774 and 1796 he lived at 3 (later 56) Poland Street and thereafter at 103 Long Acre, Covent Garden, where he gave drawing classes; among his pupils were Thomas Girtin and the young J. M. W. Turner. The latter was sent away by Malton, who found his pupil's approach too imaginative for the exact representation required from an architectural draughtsman, but the youth was afterwards readmitted and in later life would say: &#145;But my real master, you know, was Tom Malton of Long Acre&#146;  (Thornbury, 26&#150;7). The Westminster rate books also show him at an address in Conduit Street between 1783 and 1789 and at Great Titchfield Street from 1791 to 1796.<br>
<br>In addition to these activities, Malton painted scenery for the theatre. In 1780&#150;81 he was working for Drury Lane, and from 1790 to 1794 he worked at Covent Garden. Here, among the ambitious sets for James Wild's pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin and Faustus</span>, Malton received particular praise for &#145;a representation of the scaffolding prepared for the building of the new Drury Lane Theatre as it appeared in July [1793] and which changed to a view of that theatre as it would appear when completed&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 19) and in his <span class="italic">London Theatres</span> (1795) Thomas Bellamy acclaimed his skills:<blockquote>
<div>Judicious Malton! Thy receding scene<br>
</div>
<div>Of architectural beauty so deceives<br>
</div>
<div>The eye of Admiration, that we ask&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;Is this majestic view <i>unreal</i> ALL?<br>
</div>
<div>The rising column, and the stately arch<br>
</div>
<div>Can ne'er be pictured <i>thus</i>! 'tis not in art&#146;<br>
</div> (p. 28)</blockquote>The younger Thomas Malton felt himself to be well fitted for loftier professional employment. On 10 October 1794 the artist Joseph Farington recorded in his diary that Malton had solicited his vote at the forthcoming Royal Academy elections and had said that there was &pound;350 owing to him from Drury Lane; Farington avoided any commitment. In November of the following year Malton sought election in direct competition with John Soane. Farington recorded: &#145;Smirke came to us and we conversed on the means to be employed to prevent Malton succeeding&#146;; it was decided that the luckless man should be ruled out as &#145;only a Draughtsman of Buildings, but no Architect&#146;. A few weeks later, on 17 December 1795, Farington noted &#145;Hamilton told me Malton proposes to paint views of London in order to qualify himself for the Academy as a painter&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.253, 2.395&#150;7, 399). This stout-hearted response to the academicians' rebuff inspired what was to be Malton's most important work&#151;the 100 aquatint plates which make up <span class="italic">A Picturesque Tour through the Cities of London and Westminster</span> (1792&#150;1801). These catch the expanding metropolis at its most elegant and most self-assured. Among so much good topographical work at this period, Malton's views are particularly valuable because they often show an unexpected angle or record an otherwise neglected building. For example, he shows the north, Threadneedle Street, fa&ccedil;ade of the second Royal Exchange as well as its better-documented Cornhill, southern, frontage and for good measure he throws in another plate of the now vanished arcade on the northern front as well. The elegant little figures, which lend humanity to the building and which include a street vendor with a trayful of toys and novelties, may well be by Francis Wheatley.<br>
<br>But in spite of the excellence of the work, in spite of a new series begun on Oxford, and in spite of his illustrations of buildings by Sir Robert Taylor, the academicians' ranks remained closed against Malton, and the next reference to him in Farington's diary (24 March 1804) grimly recorded his death at home in Long Acre from a putrid fever on 7 March, leaving seven children  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.2274).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> speaks of Malton as an &#145;ingenious and much-respected artist&#146; and says that he had left &#145;a wife and six young children&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 74/1, 1804, 293). Later that year, on 4 and 5 May, his drawings, &#145;many of them enriched with Figures by the late W. Hamilton RA&#146;, were put up for auction at Christies, along with a &#145;pianoforte by Beck&#146; and &#145;the original design for the drop curtain at the opening of the present Theatre, Drury Lane&#146;  (Christies catalogues). The drawings and engravings sold well: the piano and a view of the Adelphi went to the Adam brothers, Lord Bessborough bought views of Oxford and Bath, and the collector William Crowle scooped up everything that he could on London. At the time of Malton's death, his eldest son was a cadet in India; the second son, Charles, served a seven-year apprenticeship to John Soane, but the one surviving letter suggests that it was not a happy relationship and the young man does not seem to have practised as an architect.<br>
<br>Works by the younger Thomas Malton are to be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the Ashmolean at Oxford. The Guildhall has some excellent examples of his work, but perhaps the best of all is a large (660 mm &times; 960 mm) pen and wash drawing of the west front of St Paul's Cathedral, engraved as the last plate of the <span class="italic">Picturesque Tour</span> (now in the drawings collection at the RIBA); it is for such work that Thomas Malton deserves to be remembered.<br>
