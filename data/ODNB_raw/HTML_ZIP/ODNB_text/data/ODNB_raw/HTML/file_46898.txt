<span class="headword">Clarksone,  Bessie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">exemplar of godly life</span>, lived in Lanark at least from 1621, but probably earlier, and died there in April 1625. Knowledge of her life and personality comes from a transcript of conversations between her and her minister, William Livingstone, <span class="italic">The conflict in conscience of a deare Christian named Bessie Clarksone in the parish of Lanark, which she lay under three year and a half, with the conference that past between her pastor and her at diverse times</span> (1632). She was married and had at least one child, and was probably a native Scot, given she uses some Scottish dialect words. Although she describes herself as &#145;a silly poor woman&#146;  (Livingstone, 11), she had one servant  (ibid., 4), and possibly owned a few jewels  (ibid., 24). Before the crisis of faith, which seems to have coincided with an illness which mainly confined her to her home, she &#145;delighted in prayer&#146; and &#145;had many calamities&#146;  (ibid.), but no further details of her previous life are known.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Conflict in Conscience</span> is an ongoing dialogue between sinner and pastor, over three and a half years, in which Clarksone continually doubts her faith in God and her salvation. The anguished expression of her crisis of faith, which remains unresolved at her death, portrays a woman of some education in Calvinist and biblical tenets (she knows about the Calvinist doctrine of election) and some independence in interpreting and applying those tenets to her own life. Throughout the short work her continual, but failed, struggle to discover and acknowledge God's love is heard. Vivid and concrete exempla from everyday life help render the text accessible and effective as a religious polemic from which other sinners and doubters could learn. The minister visited her frequently (Clarksone cries at one point, &#145;you are troubled with me in pulpit and out in pulpit and in coming to me day after day&#146;  (Livingstone, 39) and there were other parishioners witnessing her crisis of faith. This was a communal parish matter, a focal and spectacular event like those which attracted visitors to the bedsides of women prophets in the 1630s and 1640s. Clarksone engages actively and intelligently with her visitors: &#145;when one beside spake to her of God's favour and presence, she said, &#147;God if I were as sure of it as you are&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 6); &#145;When some standing by spake to her, she says, &#147;take all that to yourself that ye say to me, ye have no harrows, no assurance more nor I, and knows not but ye come in the like case&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 17). She offered directed theological advice: &#145;And some gentlemen and others being with me she directs her speech to them, saying &#147;Ye gentlemen and simple and all, let my casting back be your forward coming. Well are ye that can believe and pray, but I have none&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 20).<br>
<br>Livingstone claims that Clarksone began to turn to God, although the reader is given no concrete, cited evidence of her saying this. She died in Livingstone's absence, &#145;in presence of divers witnesses&#146;, without speaking, but with her hands and eyes &#145;heaved to the heavens&#146;  (Livingstone, 41). He believes &#145;none will doubt of her deliverance&#146;  (ibid., 42), although the theological commonplace sits tantalizingly juxtaposed with the accounts of eyewitnesses and the verbal repetition of her continued despair. The popularity and power of her account possibly lies in this very ambiguity: reflecting and fostering the Calvinist doubt about salvation.<br>
<br>The text, despite, or perhaps because of, being about an obscure and ordinary woman's crisis of faith, was reprinted several times, and belongs to the popular genre of conversion and deathbed narratives. William Livingstone explains in his preface to the 1632 edition that he has published her words (&#145;as I visit I wrote&#146;) in order to counter an &#145;uncorrect record&#146;, probably published the year before, although now not extant. Further editions were published in 1664 and 1698, with grammatical and spelling alterations.<br>
