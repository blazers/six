<span class="headword">Hewlett,  Joseph Thomas James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1800, <em>d.</em> 1847), <span class="occ">novelist and Church of England clergyman</span>, son of Joseph Hewlett and Frances Batchelor of the parish of St Pancras, London, where he was born, was baptized on 31 May 1800 at St Pancras Old Church, Pancras Road, London. He was educated at the Charterhouse, London, where he was placed by the earl of Eldon, the lord chancellor. He matriculated from Worcester College, Oxford, on 13 May 1818, and graduated BA on 5 February 1822 and MA on 25 May 1826. After taking holy orders, he married. His wife was not wealthy and, unfortunately, subsequently became an invalid. Soon after, he was appointed headmaster of Abingdon grammar school. His career there was a failure, made worse by his wife's constant illness. He did not hold the post long, and his subsequent life was a prolonged struggle with poverty.<br>
<br>Hewlett retired to Letcombe Regis, Berkshire, to take the curacy at Wantage, which was close by, and while there endeavoured to gain an income by writing novels. Some of his efforts include <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Peter Priggins, the College Scout and Bedmaker</span> (1841, with illustrations by Phiz (Hablot K. Browne)), <span class="italic">The Parish Clerk</span> (1841), <span class="italic">College Life, or, The Proctor's Notebook</span> (1843), and <span class="italic">Great Tom of Oxford</span> (1846). It is clear from the titles of these novels that he based much of his fiction on his own experience, but nowhere is this more evident than in <span class="italic">Parsons and Widows</span> (1844; 2nd edn, 1857), in which he presents a semi-autobiographical portrait under the name of the Curate of Mosbury. He also contributed many articles to the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>In 1840, through the intercession of Fox Maule (afterwards Lord Panmure), an old schoolfellow, Lord Chancellor Cottenham presented Hewlett to the rectory of Little Stambridge, near Rochford, Essex, of the annual value of &pound;175. The climate in Essex adversely affected his health, and he died at the rectory in Little Stambridge on 24 January 1847. His body was interred at the expense of his masonic brethren of the True Friendship lodge at Rochford. As he died in relative poverty, a public subscription was taken up for the four sons and five daughters who survived him.<br>
