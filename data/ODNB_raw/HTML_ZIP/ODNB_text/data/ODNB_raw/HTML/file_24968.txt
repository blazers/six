<span class="headword">Scrimgeour <span class="st"> [Scrymgeour]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1505?&#150;1572), <span class="occ">diplomat and book collector</span>, was born in Dundee, most likely in 1505 but possibly in 1508 or 1509, since Andrew Melville gives Scrimgeour's age at death as sixty-three. His parents were James Scrimgeour, burgess, who had died by 23 May 1525, and his wife, Jonet, who was still alive in June 1552. Henry's sister Margaret married John Young, father to Sir Peter Young, later royal librarian to James VI, while another sister, Isobel, married Richard Melville of Baldovie, and was mother to the presbyterian reformer James Melville. Having first attended Dundee grammar school, Henry Scrimgeour then went to St Salvator's College, St Andrews, in 1532. He determined as a bachelor in 1533, and won first place in the examination for licence the following year. Some time later he proceeded to Paris where he studied under Guillaume Bud&eacute; and Pierre Ramus. The name &#145;Henricus Scrymgeour&#146; appears twice in the rector's register, on 23 March and 22 June 1538. He incepted under the Scot William Cranston, and shortly afterwards went to Bourges to study civil law for four years under &Eacute;guinaire Baron and Fran&ccedil;ois Douaren. While in Bourges, he formed an acquaintance with Jacques Amyot, professor of Greek, and succeeded the Hellenist in becoming preceptor to the sons of Guillaume Bochetel, the secretary of state, probably for three or four years. In February 1547 he returned to Scotland for a short stay and Bochetel recommended him in a letter to Mary of Guise as an &#145;homme de honneste vie, de vertu et de grand s&ccedil;avoir tant en lettres grecques que latines&#146; (&#145;a man of honourable life, integrity, and great learning in both Greek and Latin literature&#146;; M. Wood, ed., <span class="italic">Balcarres Papers</span>, Scottish History Society, 7, 1925, 201).<br>
<br>Back in France in 1548, Scrimgeour accompanied his pupil Bernardin Bochetel to Padua. Although a Catholic, he was plunged into the controversies of the Italian Reformation when he visited a young lawyer of Cittadella, Francesco Spiera, who was slowly dying of despair, having adopted the new opinions and then been forced to recant. Scrimgeour wrote an essay on piety, published at Geneva (under the name of Henricus Scotus) by Jean Gerard and with a preface by Calvin dated December 1549, entitled <span class="italic">Exemplum memorabile desperationis in Francisco Spera, propter abiuratam fidei confessionem</span> (1550). The tract was republished the same year in Basel. None the less, it was some years before Scrimgeour would openly show his adherence to protestantism, and his second publication was a law book, an edition of the <span class="italic">Novellae</span>, printed by Estienne in Geneva in May 1558 and subsidized by Ulrich Fugger, entitled: <span class="italic">Impp. Justiniani, Justini, Leonis novellae constitutiones</span>. The <span class="italic">Novellae</span> were fundamental to the teaching of law on the continent at this time, and a new edition was badly needed. Scrimgeour used his contacts with the French ambassador to Venice to gain access to the important Bessarian codex there, and his edition was well received by contemporary lawyers. The period between 1558 and his last visit to Italy in 1564 represents the most energetic part of Scrimgeour's activity in another capacity, that of book collector; it is accepted that the greatest part of the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew manuscripts of the Fugger collection were gathered by Scrimgeour, who frequently travelled between Augsburg and Italy. It is today the core of the Vatican Palatine collection. Scrimgeour also acted as agent in buying books for Otto-Heinrich, the elector palatine.<br>
<br>Scrimgeour kept his benefices in Scotland all his life, but he also enjoyed an income in France&#151;there exists an authorization given to him in 1556 by King Henri II to hold and receive benefices in his country of adoption. The Scot had remained close to Bernardin Bochetel, now abbot of St Laurent des Aubats (Pouilly-sur-Loire, near Cosne), and he now engaged on a diplomatic career, travelling to Padua, Venice, Florence, Rome, Milan, Mantua, and Bologna, and also to Bourges, where he tried unsuccessfully to set up a printing press. Bochetel had several times invited him to Vienna, and he finally went there in November 1560. Bochetel may have wanted his diplomatic services at this time to help him in difficult negotiations with the German Lutheran princes, or with the colloquy of Poissy of 1561 between French reformers and Catholics, or with the Council of Trent, which after a ten-year interval had resumed its sessions in January 1562. However, Scrimgeour's stay in Vienna was brief, for by the end of 1561 he was in Geneva. It may be that events in Scotland and the failure of the colloquy of Poissy forced an irrevocable decision upon him. Moreover, Ulrich Fugger, now a Lutheran, had a plan for a public library in Geneva in order to secure his large and important collection of rare books, and Scrimgeour was associated with this project. At the same time, on 30 December, he was honoured by the magistrates of Geneva who received him as a burgess, three years after John Knox, and thanks to Calvin he soon became involved in the city's public life.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1562, with Calvin's blessing, Scrimgeour married Fran&ccedil;oise de Saussure (<i>b</i>. 1542/3) in the Genevan church of St Pierre. His wife came from a family of religious refugees from Lorraine, which they had left in 1552, and her father Antoine de Saussure, lord of Dommartin, settled in Lausanne. However, Fran&ccedil;oise soon died, on 1 February 1568, aged twenty-five, leaving a three-year old daughter, Marie. In 1563 the Genevan pastors appointed Scrimgeour reader in philosophy, and the same year he was admitted to the town's council of two hundred. Later he started giving lessons in civil law. He was neither an assiduous teacher nor a good one: &#145;il lit inutilement&#146; wrote Theodore Beza  (Borgeaud, 92 n. 4). Moreover he was often away from Geneva, for instance in Padua where &#145;D. Henricus Schrenzer scottus&#146; is recorded in July 1564 as counsellor to the Scottish nation of jurists. When Calvin died in the spring of 1564 Scrimgeour was witness to his will. About this time he acquired the old castle called Villette, outside Geneva, but his house burnt down and by 1569 Bochetel had caused the French treasury to pay him 200 crowns in assistance. On 3 January 1570 Scrimgeour joined the council of sixty at Geneva, and on 11 May he remarried. His second wife was Catherine de Veillet, daughter of Aubert Veillet, <i>maitre des comptes</i> (chief financial officer) at Chamb&eacute;ry. At this time two regents&#151;the earls of Moray and Mar&#151;and also George Buchanan tried to attract Scrimgeour back to Scotland to assist in the education of the young James VI, but he regretfully declined, arguing his age and the instability of Scotland. Henry Scrimgeour died in Geneva on 23 September 1572.<br>
