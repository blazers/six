<span class="headword">Baker,  John Gilbert</span>  (1834&#150;1920), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 13 January 1834 at Guisborough, Yorkshire, the son of John Baker, draper and grocer, and his wife, Mary Gilbert. In August 1834 his parents moved to Thirsk, Yorkshire, and opened a shop. In 1843 he became a pupil at the Quaker school in Ackworth, Yorkshire, and then in 1846 at the Quaker school at Bootham in York, whose pupils were encouraged to study natural history. His schooling ended late in 1847, after which he helped his father in the family business until 1864. He married Hannah Unthank (<i>d</i>. 1902) in August 1860. Their son Edmund Gilbert (1864&#150;1949) was also a botanist and eventually became assistant keeper at the Natural History Museum, London.<br>
<br>Baker began collecting plants when he was only twelve and he briefly had charge of the school herbarium at Bootham. When he was fifteen the <span class="italic">Phytologist</span> published his note on the occurrence in a rather boggy wood in north-east Yorkshire of a sedge he identified as being <i>Carex persoonii</i> (now <i>Carex curta</i>). His intimate knowledge of the local flora encouraged him to collaborate with John Nowell in issuing a supplement to H. Baines's <span class="italic">Flora of Yorkshire</span> (1840) in 1854. The following year he read a paper at the annual meeting at Glasgow of the British Association, on British flowering plants and ferns, which he declared was an attempt to classify them according to their &#145;geognostic relations&#146;.<br>
<br>When the scheme for the national exchange of plant specimens was suspended by the Botanical Society of London, Baker suggested that the Thirsk Natural History Society might take over the service. His proposal was approved and in 1859 he became curator and secretary of the Thirsk Botanical Exchange Club under the aegis of the Thirsk Natural History Society. It was largely through his efficient management of this exchange of plant specimens that Thirsk became an important centre for field botany in Britain. His first major work, <span class="italic">North Yorkshire: Studies of its Botany, Geology, Climate and Physical Geography</span> (1863) was a pioneering ecological survey of over 1100 species of flowering plants and ferns. Unfortunately most of the copies were lost in a fire which devastated the family business in 1864. The Yorkshire Naturalists' Union began reprinting the work in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in 1888, and an enlarged edition was published in 1906. It is a measure of the esteem in which Baker was held that donations from fellow botanists enabled him to replace the library he had lost in the fire.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1865 Joseph Hooker, recently appointed director at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, wrote to Baker that he anticipated &#145;soon to be in need of a person of <i>careful, neat, accurate</i> and <i>industrious</i> habits, who has made some progress in Systematic Botany and is really fond of the pursuit&#146;  (Hooker to Baker, 20 Nov 1865, RBG Kew, Baker MSS). Shortly afterwards Baker took up an appointment as an assistant in the Kew herbarium in January 1866. The work of the Thirsk Botanical Exchange Club was then taken over by the newly formed London Botanical Exchange Club with Baker as joint curator. His first task at Kew was the completion of the late Sir William Hooker's <span class="italic">Synopsis filicum</span>, which was published in 1868. In addition to taxonomic work, he lectured on botany at the London Hospital medical school, 1869&#150;81, at Kew to student gardeners, 1874&#150;1904, and at the Chelsea Physic Garden, 1882&#150;96. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1878. He became principal assistant to the keeper of the Kew herbarium in 1884 and its keeper in 1890.<br>
<br>Baker contributed substantially to the colonial floras prepared at Kew during his quarter of a century in the herbarium. <span class="italic">Flora of Mauritius and Seychelles</span> (1877) was entirely his own work; so, too, was volume 6 of the <span class="italic">Flora Capensis</span> (1896&#150;7); he described species in the <span class="italic">Flora of British India</span> and <span class="italic">Flora of Tropical Africa</span>. The <span class="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</span> published his enumeration of the plants of Madagascar. It has been calculated that he wrote about 400 papers which appeared mainly in the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, <span class="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</span>, and <span class="italic">Kew Bulletin</span>.<br>
<br>Baker was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> between 1869 and 1899 on monocotyledons of interest to gardeners. These articles formed the basis of his handbooks on Amaryllidaceae (1887), Bromeliaceae (1889), and Iridaceae (1892). His research on roses which began with a paper on British species in the <span class="italic">Naturalist</span> (1864) culminated with the text to Alfred Parson's plates in the <span class="italic">Genus Rosa</span> (1910&#150;14). Ferns remained an abiding interest. He revised Sir William Hooker's <span class="italic">Synopsis filicum</span> in 1874; contributed the volume on ferns to C. F. P. von Martius's <span class="italic">Flora Brasiliensis</span>; described 100 new or rare ferns in volume 17 of <span class="italic">Icones plantarum</span> (1886&#150;7); and wrote a <span class="italic">Handbook of the Fern-Allies</span> (1887). He never abandoned his interest in British plants, as <span class="italic">A Flora of the English Lake District</span> (1885) testified.<br>
<br>It has been said that Baker's output was so impressive because he chose to study plant families that did not require microscopic examination. It is more likely, however, that his wholehearted dedication to the task in hand is the explanation. Joseph Forster's portrait of him depicts him completely absorbed in his work, plants and herbarium sheets around him on his desk. A kind and considerate man, he had a number of interests, in particular poetry, but botany was always his chief concern. The Linnean Society honoured him with its gold medal in 1899, and the Royal Horticultural Society with the Victoria medal of honour in 1897 and the Veitch memorial medal in 1907. The plant genera <i>Bakerella</i> (a genus in Loranthaceae, native to Madagascar, <i>Bakeria</i> (now <i>Bakerantha</i>, a South American Bromeliad), and <i>Neobakeria</i> (a South African genus belonging to Liciaceae) were named in his honour.<br>
<br>Baker retired in 1899. His wife died in 1902 and he died at his home, 3 Cumberland Road, Kew, on 16 August 1920. He was buried at the Quaker burial-ground, Isleworth, on 19 August.<br>
