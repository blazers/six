<span class="headword">Letts,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1772, <em>d.</em> 1851), <span class="occ">stationer and diary publisher</span>, was baptized on 21 June 1772 at St Peter's Church, Cornhill, London, the third of the three children of John Letts and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beaman, who were both also baptized and married in the parish.<br>
<br>After serving an apprenticeship as a bookbinder, Letts set up business as a stationer in the City of London in 1796. His premises were in the Royal Exchange, and his clientele included merchants and traders in the City. One of the chief requirements of the latter, apart from the regular recording of financial transactions, was a need to know about the movements of ships to and from the Port of London. This they obtained from a diary in which prominence was given to the working week, with a cash ruling through the diary section and tide tables in the opening pages.<br>
<br>Letts sensed that there could be a market for more general diaries of this type, but ones that were future-dated, so that the diary owner could plan ahead and not simply record the events of the day. His first such diary was issued in 1812 as a deliberately commercial product. Unlike existing diaries, it simply printed the dates of a six-day working week, Monday to Saturday, with no information other than the public holidays as they fell. The publication was branded by a printed label on the front cover &#145;Diary. 1812. Sold by John Letts Stationer. Royal Exchange&#146;. There was soon a public demand for more informative contents, and by the early 1820s Letts was publishing a range of diaries in different sizes and formats, incorporating in their pages governmental, legal, commercial, and astronomical information, as what was essentially a combination of a detailed almanac and a day-to-day dated notebook.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1800 Letts married Mary Spicer, in Saffron Walden, Essex. They had two sons, John and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16526/', "Thomas Letts")</script>, who were also baptized at St Peter's, Cornhill. Mary died on 6 October 1815, aged forty-two, and was buried at St Stephen's, Coleman Street. On 16 November 1816, at St Michael's, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, Letts married his second wife, Frances Debenham (1788&#150;1848), then aged twenty-eight. John and Frances had twin sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The commercial publication of Letts's diary proved to be a success, and the booklet was well received by the merchants and shipping personnel whose patronage Letts sought. However, although Letts realized that a more general publication might well appeal to a wider market, his initial commercial activity was modest, and two factors rather militated against any immediate expansion. The first was that his output was restricted to local consumers in particular lines of business. The second was that he was not a natural businessman, and pursued his chosen trade more with a sense of stolid optimism than with a genuine entrepreneurial flair. The diaries were in a sense simply an extension of his basic skills as a bookbinder. It might also be added that the 1830s were not overall a favourable time for commercial development. It was thus left to his son, Thomas, who took over the firm in the 1830s, to move the business significantly forward, and to diversify it into maps and stationery products and to find an overseas response to these, especially in the English-speaking world of the burgeoning British empire.<br>
<br>By the time Thomas took over, Honest Jack Letts, as he had come to be known, was living in retirement with his wife at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. It was there that Frances predeceased him, dying of dysentery on 30 April 1848, aged fifty-nine. John survived her for less than three years, dying of dropsy on 25 March 1851. Although both wife and husband ended their days in Broxbourne, they were each buried at St Olave's, Hart Street, London, where John's eldest son was rector. The Revd John Letts officiated at his mother's funeral, but not his father's.<br>
<br>The family firm later came to bear the name not of its founder, John Letts, but of Charles Letts, Thomas's son, who broke with the company in 1881 to set up independently. John Letts's own firm went into liquidation in 1885.<br>
