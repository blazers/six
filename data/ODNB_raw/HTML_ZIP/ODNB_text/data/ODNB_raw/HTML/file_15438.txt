</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keppel,  Arnold Joost  van</span>, first earl of Albemarle  (1669/70&#150;1718), <span class="occ">courtier and army officer</span>, was born in 1669 or 1670, probably in Gelderland, United Provinces, and was probably baptized on 30 January 1670 at Zutphen in Gelderland, the son of Osewalt van Keppel, lord of Voorst (<i>d</i>. 1685), and his wife, Reinira Anna Geertruid van Lintelo tot de Mars. The Keppels were long established in Gelderland, and were descended from Walter, lord of Keppel (<i>fl</i>. 1179&#150;1223). At his father's death Keppel found his estates heavily in debt; although he was of high birth, his prospects would depend on his own abilities.<br>
<br>A page of honour, Keppel accompanied William, prince of Orange, to England in 1688 and remained with him following his accession to the throne with his wife, Mary II, in 1689. He came to William's attention in March 1691 when he broke his leg while hunting; William was impressed with his bravery while the wound was set, and later that year he appointed him a groom of the bedchamber; he may also have provided funds to redeem the lordship of Voorst from Keppel's creditors. William adopted Keppel as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Keppel's outgoing manner made him many friends, including the king's mistress Elizabeth Villiers. He emerged as a leading representative of the younger generation at court and as such William came to find him more useful than his more withdrawn confidant William Bentinck, first earl of Portland. After the death of Mary, Keppel became William's closest companion. In 1695 he was appointed master of the robes and was installed in a suite communicating with that of William at Kensington Palace. Although contemporaries and later writers have inferred a homosexual relationship from this evidence, this was certainly not the case; William preferred his closest aide to have an adjoining room to his as his working practices needed his presence well into the night, and Keppel was renowned for his succession of mistresses. Keppel's loyalty to William was rewarded when on 10 February 1697 he was created Baron Ashford, Viscount Bury, and earl of Albemarle.<br>
<br>The rise of the apparently frivolous Albemarle infuriated Portland, and Albemarle certainly raised no objections when Portland was sent to Paris as ambassador. Albemarle also used his influence to have John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, an antagonist of Portland, appointed governor to William, duke of Gloucester, the only son of Princess Anne and heir to the British thrones.<br>
<br>In June 1697 Albemarle was made major-general on the English establishment and appointed colonel of the 1st troop of Horse Guards (Life Guards), although he sold this post to Portland in 1710. On 14 May 1700 he was made KG and became colonel of the first regiment of Swiss in the Dutch service. The earl later became colonel of the carabineers in the Dutch army, governor of s'Hertogenbosch, and deputy forester of Holland. In 1701 he married Geertruid Johanna Quirina, the daughter of Adama van der Duyn, lord of St Gravemoer, governor of Bergen op Zoom, and master of buckhounds to the stadholder. There was a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15443/', "William Anne Keppel (1702&#150;1754)")</script>, and a daughter, Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1773), from the marriage.<br>
<br>Shortly before William III died, and following Louis XIV's seizure of the barrier fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, promised to the United Provinces at the treaty of Ryswick (1697), Albemarle was sent to the Netherlands to confer with the states general on future strategy against France. This delicate mission was accomplished with great skill, and Albemarle confirmed his friendship with Marlborough during this period. He was at William's side at his deathbed in March 1702, and the king is reputed to have whispered &#145;You know what to do with them&#146; as he handed him the keys to his private cabinet and drawers. William bequeathed to his favourite 200,000 guilders and the lordship of Breevorst, although legal arguments about this last bequest with members of William's family went on for some years.<br>
<br>Albemarle returned to the Netherlands in 1702, and as a general of horse in the Dutch army had an active part in the duke of Marlborough's campaigns in the Low Countries during the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1703 he was entrusted with the command of a major convoy bringing supplies to the allied forces at Maastricht, and brought off a difficult task with great ability. Marlborough stayed at Albemarle's house just before the march to the Danube began in 1704, an indication of the friendship between the two men. Albemarle was present at the forcing of the lines of Brabant in 1705, and correctly urged an active pursuit of the beaten French and Bavarians, against the wishes of his fellow Dutch commanders. He also fought at Ramillies (1706) and Oudenarde (1708). During the protracted siege of Lille (1708) Marlborough employed him with thirty squadrons of cavalry to cover the progress of a great convoy bringing supplies to the allied siege train from Brussels. The success of this hazardous enterprise, in the face of two powerful French armies, was largely on account of the earl's skilful conduct. In 1709 he was made governor of Tournai, after which he was actively engaged at the sieges of Bouchain and Aire (1711). Following Marlborough's dismissal he was in command of the allied garrison at Denain, when the fortress was stormed by Marshal Villars (24 March 1712). Despite a strenuous defence the Dutch troops were overwhelmed and the earl was taken prisoner. However, he was released soon afterwards; that winter he entertained Prince Eugene of Savoy at his house.<br>
<br>On the death of Queen Anne in 1714 Albemarle was sent by the states general to George I with congratulations on his accession to the throne of Great Britain. He was entrusted with the reception of the king and his entourage at the Dutch border <i>en route</i> for London. Albemarle died at The Hague on 30 May 1718 and was succeeded by his son, William Anne, as second earl. His widow died in December 1741 at The Hague.<br>
<br>Albemarle, who enjoyed a generally wide popularity, was described as a generous and charming man, but was rather absorbed in his own pleasures in youth. William III was very taken with his good looks and fine manners, though more importantly recognized his emerging talents as an administrator and an officer. His early role as royal favourite has overshadowed his undoubted ability as a military commander. This quality, while perhaps not of the first rank, enabled Marlborough to employ Albemarle on important tasks requiring high capability and judgement.<br>
