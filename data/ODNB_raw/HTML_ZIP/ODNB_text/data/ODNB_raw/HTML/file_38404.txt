<span class="headword">Warwick,  Arthur</span>  (1604&#150;1633), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born in February 1604, the son of Arthur Warwick, master of the grammar school in the close, Salisbury. The elder Warwick held the post from 1617 until his death in 1651 and it is to be presumed that both father and son resided for some of those years at Braybroke House, the master's official residence in the close. His father's neglect of professional duties and his consequent protracted quarrels with the Salisbury chapter may have made Warwick's adolescence unquiet; otherwise nothing is known of his early upbringing or schooling. At Oxford Warwick, matriculated from Magdalen Hall on 31 January 1623 and received his BA degree on 16 December 1624 (not 15 December, as given by both Foster and Clark); he appears not to have proceeded MA. In February 1627 he was made deacon by the bishop of Salisbury; where Warwick began his ministry is not known. He was admitted to priest's orders on 21 September 1628 and licensed to serve at Durley, a village about 10 miles south of Winchester. It was there that Warwick completed the first part of <span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span>, his only book. He dedicated it to Sir William Dodington, an important landowner of Breamore, 8 miles south of Salisbury. His son, Henry, was the same age as Warwick and had been his exact contemporary at Magdalen Hall. Although Warwick protested, in the dedication, that their acquaintance was &#145;short, and small&#146; he gratefully acknowledged Dodington's former favours. As Dodington was both wealthy and influential such patronage could have been substantial.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span> was entered in the registers of the Stationers' Company to Walter Hammond on 24 March 1632. Its title is given as <span class="italic">Resolved Meditations and Premeditated Resolutions</span>, and both the engraved title-pages that it eventually had carry variants of this form; neither bears the words &#145;Spare minutes&#146; which are to be found only on the letterpress title-pages of all early editions.<br>
<br>Warwick's ministry at Durley lasted just five years. At a visitation on 23 September 1633 it was noted that he was ill, and within a few weeks he had died, at Durley. Warwick was buried there on 31 October 1633 but his grave has not been traced. He was twenty-nine years of age.<br>
<br>The earliest edition of <span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span> of which a copy is known is dated 1634 and described as the &#145;second Edition corrected and enlarged&#146;. It is arranged in two parts. The first, containing sixty-one meditations, has an emblematic engraved title-page with accompanying verse in English by the &#145;Inventor&#146; (apparently Richard Haydock, who designed the engraved title-pages), and also twenty lines of Latin by William Haydock, son of Richard. The second part is described in the dedication as a posthumous addition &#145;collected out of loose papers&#146; after Warwick's death. This has a further thirty-seven similar meditations, together with three short passages of verse, one of which was the last thing that Warwick composed, a few days before his death. This latter part is dedicated by the author's father to a Mistress Anne Ashton. The &#145;meditations&#146; of the second part, &#145;wanting filing, and polishing&#146;  (dedication), are the longer and the less concisely expressed. The meditations, or prose aphorisms, vary in length from 25 to 290 words. The whole is written in a witty, highly antithetical style, deploying familiar imagery to provide sound moral instruction. Its merit is considerable, and it enjoyed remarkable success. There were at least eight editions and reissues between 1634 and 1700, and the appearance of a further ten after 1800 is impressive evidence of its enduring vitality.<br>
<br>Before the next edition of <span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span> was published in 1635 its preliminaries were revised and rearranged. The book was embellished by the addition of a new engraved emblematic title-page (the earlier engraving then being prefixed to the second part) and a passage of verse by Francis Quarles with another by George Wither to accompany the two engravings respectively. Wither's contribution replaced the lines by the inventor, which were then omitted. With the 1635 third edition <span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span> assumed, in essentials, the form in which it has commonly been reprinted. The plates are signed by Thomas Clarke of Salisbury, as engraver, but their design is now attributed to Richard Haydocke, also of Salisbury. The theme that they symbolically express is of the pious soul overcoming the world and ascending to heaven, leaving behind his work and memory for the edification of those who remain. They are remarkable examples of their kind. Richard Haydock was an eminent physician, translator, and engraver. Since Haydock and Warwick senior, each a noted figure in Salisbury, both resided in the close, it is improbable that they were unacquainted. Possibly the contribution of the Haydocks to <span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span> was a token of esteem.<br>
<br>Warwick's life at Durley (known as &#145;dirty Durley&#146; because of the bad state of its roads) was probably lonely and obscure. But he was not without influential connections. The Anne Ashton to whom his father dedicated the second part of <span class="italic">Spare Minutes</span> was the widow of Thomas Ashton of Bishop's Waltham, 3 miles from Durley. Thomas Ashton had been noted for his good works, and he left his wife a large estate and a considerable income. The elder Warwick acknowledges her &#145;favours&#146; to himself and to his son, &#145;who in his life time studied to be thankfull to you&#146;  (dedication).<br>
