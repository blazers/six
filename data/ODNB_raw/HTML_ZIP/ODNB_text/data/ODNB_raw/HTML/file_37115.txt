<span class="headword">Anderson,  Tempest</span>  (1846&#150;1913), <span class="occ">ophthalmic surgeon and vulcanologist</span>, was born on 7 December 1846 at 17 Stonegate, York, the elder son and eldest of the three children of William Charles Anderson, surgeon of York, and his wife, Sarah Ellen Hall. Educated at St Peter's School, York, and at University College, London, he gained his MD degree in 1873, and was subsequently elected a fellow of the college. In 1904 he became honorary DSc of the University of Leeds.<br>
<br>Anderson specialized in eye diseases, becoming consulting ophthalmic surgeon at York County Hospital. He successfully combined his career with worldwide travel and scientific study, often applying the resulting experience to benefit his native city, where he was held in high regard. He took an active interest in the city's waterworks, town planning, and housing problems, and in the preservation of the city's green spaces and ancient monuments. A JP, he was appointed sheriff of York in 1894.<br>
<br>Anderson took a great interest in the dissemination of science to the public. A leading member and benefactor of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, he was also its secretary and president. He presented the society with a lecture theatre, named the Tempest Anderson Hall, which opened in June 1912. Nationally, Anderson served on the councils of the Royal Geographical Society, the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society, and the British Association (he was vice-president in 1906). In 1910 he was elected president of the Museums Association.<br>
<br>Anderson's main amateur interests were geology (particularly vulcanology), photography, and mountaineering, pursuits which he combined successfully. He was a distinguished and active member of the Alpine Club, having been elected in 1893. He made his own cameras and lenses, including a panoramic camera, and promoted the use of photography in geology. He served on a British Association committee which arranged the collection and documentation of several thousand geological photographs. The Royal Institution appointed him Tyndall lecturer on volcanoes, and he won awards for photographic studies of mountains and glaciers. Much of Anderson's collection of glass negatives and lantern slides was preserved in the Yorkshire Museum.<br>
<br>From 1883 Anderson spent much time abroad, especially in areas of active volcanoes. He kept two bags always packed, one for hot climes and one for cold, so that immediately he heard of an eruption he could board the next available ship. In spite of the limitations of travel, he visited most major volcanic areas of the world. In 1902, with John Flett of the Geological Survey, he was commissioned by the Royal Society to investigate the catastrophic eruptions on the islands of Martinique and St Vincent (<span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, 1903 and 1908). Detailed observations, at considerable personal risk, and comparisons with his studies of alpine avalanches, led to a better understanding of pyroclastic flows&#151;fast-moving, destructive avalanches of hot gas and rock particles. This was Anderson's most important contribution to vulcanology. His photographs and descriptions convey concern for the human suffering resulting from natural disasters. He appreciated the importance of careful, systematic observation, referring to this as a &#145;clinical or bedside study&#146;. He excelled in conveying information in a palatable, humorous, and exciting form to a general audience. Good examples are found in his book of photographs, <span class="italic">Volcanic Studies in many Lands</span> (1903; a second, posthumous volume was published in 1917). A bachelor, he had a reputation as an honest, likeable, and generous man, with a gift for forming lasting friendships.<br>
<br>Anderson's last expedition was to the volcanoes of Indonesia and the Philippines. On the return voyage he became ill with heat apoplexy or enteric fever, and he died on 26 August 1913 while the ship he was on was crossing the Red Sea. He was buried at Suez.<br>
