<span class="headword">Higgins,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobite Sir John Higgins, baronet]</span>  (1676&#150;1729), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Limerick, the son of Dr Patrick Higgins, physician, and his wife, Mary Loftus, daughter of John Loftus of Annacotty, co. Limerick. Both his parents were from prominent Catholic families which had suffered in the Cromwellian conquest. His paternal great-uncle, also a physician, had been hanged after the 1651 siege of Limerick, and his mother's family had been deprived of its Mungret estate in the subsequent confiscation. After the defeat of the Irish Jacobites in 1691 he went as a boy to Paris, where his mother's relative Edmund Loftus was a banker. In 1700, after a brilliant academic career, he graduated bachelor, licentiate, and doctor from the medical school at Montpellier University. The duke of Berwick, commander of the allied armies of France and Spain from 1704, persuaded him to accept the post of <i>m&eacute;decin-major</i> in the medical services of the united forces during the War of the Spanish Succession. In that capacity he participated in the great military engagements in Spain over the next decade, such as the sieges of L&eacute;rida (1707) and Barcelona (1714) and the battle of Villaviciosa (1710). He was competent and efficient, but his care of the sick and wounded at Barcelona impaired his health, and having decided that his future lay in Spain he petitioned successfully to settle in Madrid. On 25 April 1712 he married Jeanne de Courtiade (1689&#150;1764), the daughter of a Bayonne physician. They had one son, John Baptist Higgins (<i>b</i>. 1715), who subsequently became an officer in the Spanish army.<br>
<br>Higgins's reputation as a physician rose rapidly. From 1711 he was <i>medico de c&aacute;mara</i> to King Philip V, a post in which he was confirmed in 1715. In 1717 he became chief physician to the king, gaining the appointment over the other court physicians, who were all his seniors and who strongly resented his preferment. Within months he was credited with saving the king's life from a grave illness. Thereafter he enjoyed the highest esteem at court and was in constant attendance on the king, who praised him as the finest physician in Europe. Although primarily a physician, he was also skilled in surgery. He was elected president of the Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery at Seville in 1718 and again in 1720 at the end of his first term.<br>
<br>Despite having no political ambition, Higgins played some part in public affairs. In 1718 he successfully intervened with the Spanish government to secure the exclusion of Irish goods and ships from the confiscations and reprisals that followed the British sinking of the Spanish Mediterranean Fleet. In 1722 he was appointed to the council of Castile. Always a fervent Jacobite, in 1724 he was made a baronet by James III (the Old Pretender). He retained a deep love of Ireland and resented the losses suffered by the Irish Catholics, including himself and his family, emotions to which he gave strong expression when among friends. The duc de Saint-Simon, while French ambassador to Spain, was one of his patients and developed a high regard for his skill as a physician. The two men struck up a close friendship, and Saint-Simon related in his memoirs that Higgins was excellent company, candid and frank in conversation, fluent in French, and possessed of a fine intellect and a good knowledge of literature. Full of honours and renown, and having amassed considerable wealth, he died at Seville on 11 October 1729. His widow remarried, and died on 8 May 1764.<br>
