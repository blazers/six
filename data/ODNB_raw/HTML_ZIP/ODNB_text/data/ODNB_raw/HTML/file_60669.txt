<span class="headword">Roughton,  Roger Edmund Heude</span>  (1916&#150;1941), <span class="occ">writer and journal editor</span>, was born on 17 September 1916 at The Croft, Storrs Park, Undermillbeck, Lancashire, the only child of Thomas Heude Roughton and his wife, Helen Litler, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson. Roughton's father, whom he never knew, was a serviceman based in Barrow, killed in the First World War. He had set up a trust fund for his son who, at six, went to a preparatory school at Heddon Court from which he regularly ran away, although as a pupil he was capable enough to win a scholarship to Eton College. His mother, who had (traumatically for Roughton) remarried in 1923, left her second husband, a physician, when their daughter, Charlotte, was three weeks old. Social and financial problems inevitably followed. Roughton's mother decided he should go to Uppingham, his father's old school, instead of Eton.<br>
<br>Roughton left school (where he had been bullied) at sixteen, and met David Gascoyne, his junior by one month, during the winter of 1933&#150;4 in the famous left-wing Parton Street Bookshop in Holborn, London, where they were introduced by the proprietor David Archer. Shortly afterwards, Gascoyne visited Roughton in Hampstead where he was living with his half-sister, and his mother, with whom relations were strained. Eventually Roughton moved to share Gascoyne's small flat in Southwark. Later, he took rooms above the Arts Caf&eacute; in Parton Street, coming under the political influence of his friend A. L. (Bert) Lloyd, staunch communist and authority on folk music.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1935 Roughton left for the USA with John Davenport; both were friends of Dylan Thomas. They visited New York and Staten Island, and drove to California, where Roughton found work as a Hollywood extra. Towards the end of 1935, now a Communist Party member, he travelled to the USSR. By the time he started reviewing for the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> in January 1936, Roughton had had poems published in <span class="italic">The Bookman</span>, <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, and the anthology <span class="italic">Poems of Tomorrow</span> (1935). From April, his prose and poetry appeared in <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, <span class="italic">The Programme</span>, and <span class="italic">Poetry</span> (Chicago), from which he received the 1937 Harriet Monro lyric prize. &#145;He does at least think of poetry as something to be spoken,&#146; wrote W. H. Auden.<br>
<br>Julian Symons described Roughton as &#145;an aesthetic-looking young man with some literary tact and taste&#146;. By 1936 he had access to his trust fund which helped finance his magazine <span class="italic">Contemporary Poetry and Prose</span>, published from May of that year until autumn 1937 from the Arts Caf&eacute;. There were ten numbers, 1&#150;8 appeared monthly, 9&#150;10 quarterly. The &#145;surrealist double number&#146; (May 1936), issued to coincide with the June opening of the International Surrealist Exhibition in London (Roughton submitted several objects), contained translations from Andr&eacute; Breton, Paul &Eacute;luard, Ren&eacute; Char, Alfred Jarry, and Benjamin P&eacute;ret, and poems by Gascoyne, Roughton, Humphrey Jennings, and Kenneth Allott. The &#145;Picasso Poems Number&#146; (nos. 4 and 5) preceded the magazine's &#145;Declaration on Spain&#146; of November 1936, signed by the English Surrealist Group, of which Roughton was a member from 1936 to 1938, and calling for &#145;Arms for the People of Spain!&#146; However, Roughton claimed in no. 8 that his publication was &#145;in no way an official surrealist magazine&#146;. Despite his commitment, he was unable to strike a literary and political balance; he had become disillusioned. In no. 10 there was a terse announcement: &#145;The Editor is going abroad for some time&#146;. In his <span class="italic">Auden and after</span> (1942), dedicated to Roughton's memory, Francis Scarfe wrote approvingly of his magazine: &#145;Perhaps the most international review produced in the 'thirties, with the exception of <span class="italic">transition</span>&#146;. Roughton also issued two separate publications: <span class="italic">1/20</span>, poems by E. E. Cummings (whom he had met in America), and <span class="italic">Remove your Hat</span> (an unexpurgated version of the previously censored <span class="italic">A Bunch of Carrots</span>), comprising translations by Gascoyne and Jennings from P&eacute;ret.<br>
<br>Roughton travelled to France, Munich, and Czechoslovakia (driving a yellow Cord), returned to England, then left for Ireland in July 1939. On 22 April 1941 he gassed himself at his 70 Wellington Road home in Dublin; the Nazi&#150;Soviet pact was an influential factor upon his state of mind. A distressed Dylan Thomas wrote with affection of Roughton to Davenport later that month: &#145;[He was] always about somewhere with his little eyes and his cigarette, calm and treble in the middle of the crumbling system; [&hellip;] perhaps driving a Bugatti with the radio full on&#146;. Gascoyne's &#145;Elegy&#146;, written that year, celebrates their friendship, and the unforgettable loss. Roughton's last prose piece, &#145;The Human House&#146;, was published posthumously by Cyril Connolly in <span class="italic">Horizon</span> (July 1941). The writer Charlotte Hough once described her half-brother to Gascoyne as &#145;just like Spandrell in Aldous Huxley's <span class="italic">Point Counter Point</span>&#146;  (private information). Roughton's suicide helped fix his place in twentieth-century English literature, frozen for all time into the reality&#151;and the myth&#151;of the writing and politics of the 1930s.<br>
