<span class="headword">Nelson, Sir  Frank</span>  (1883&#150;1966), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born at Bentham, Gloucestershire, on 5 August 1883, the son of Henry Ellis Hay Nelson, general manager of the Army and Navy Auxiliary Co-operative Supply, and his wife, Catherine Haviland. After education at Bedford grammar school and Heidelberg, he went to India to work in a mercantile firm in Bombay in which he rose to become senior partner. In the First World War he served in the Bombay light horse. Subsequently he was chairman of the Bombay chamber of commerce and its representative on the Bombay legislative council (1922&#150;4) and president of the associated Indian chamber of commerce (1923). In 1924 he was knighted and returned to England. He was Conservative member of parliament for Stroud from 1924 to 1931 when the depression forced him to resign to concentrate on his business interests.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Nelson was employed on intelligence work in Basel, but this came to an end with the fall of France when he returned to England. Even before 1939 it had been recognized that the government would have to weaken any potential enemy by political subversion, sabotage, and other clandestine operations. When war broke out the work suffered from lack of co-ordination, for it was split up among several bodies, responsible to different authorities. By 1940, when the British were left to fight the axis powers alone, co-ordination was more than ever essential. The war cabinet consequently decided on 16 July 1940 that all these functions were to be put in the charge of a new body, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), with Hugh Dalton, who continued to be minister of economic warfare, at its head. Dalton records that the prime minister then said to him, &#145;And now set Europe ablaze&#146;. He at once divided SOE into three bodies&#151;SO1 for underground propaganda, SO2 for unacknowledgeable action, sabotage, and the support of resistance in enemy-occupied territory, and SO3 for planning. In August 1940 Dalton appointed Nelson to be head of SO2. The functions of SO3 were assumed by SO2 in January 1941, and in the following August those of SO1 by a separate body called the political warfare executive. From that point Nelson was responsible for all the remaining activities of SOE.<br>
<br>Nelson had a formidable task. Not only was there not a single agent in enemy-occupied France, but SOE was a new body for which no precedent existed. As such it incurred the suspicion and jealousy of the established secret organizations of the Foreign Office and the service ministries, all of which were professional bodies which had existed for many years and which were concerned by the inevitable amateurishness at first displayed by SOE. Another difficulty was recruitment, for by the autumn of 1940 most men of ability were employed elsewhere. Above all Nelson found he had to obtain for SOE facilities, such as secret wireless sets, aircraft for parachute training and getting agents into Europe, and special devices for sabotage. But it was no easy task to get these scarce resources unless SOE could show results, and without the resources there could be no results. Finally, he had somehow to gain the confidence of Whitehall and the services.<br>
<br>Nelson set to work at once with tireless energy, and surrounded himself with a group of able people, notably Colin Gubbins, who at first took charge of the important job of training and operations and was to finish the war as head of SOE. Gradually Nelson overcame the difficulties by his unshakeable integrity of purpose. It was a disappointment to him when in early 1941 the chiefs of staff ruled against supplying secret armies in Europe by air in favour of the bombing offensive. But he persisted, and by the winter of 1941 SOE was in touch with agents and supporters in most of the countries of occupied Europe. Above all, Nelson made people believe that, given facilities, results could be achieved. In less than two years SOE had become an established force with the confidence of the chiefs of staff, and was recognized in every theatre of war. It is no disparagement of his successors to say that he created the groundwork without which SOE's later successes in Europe and the Far East would have been impossible.<br>
<br>But Nelson was never physically strong, and in 1942 his health began to fail. He resigned in May, was appointed KCMG, and subsequently held appointments as an air commodore in Washington and Germany. He had married in 1911 Jean, daughter of Colonel Patrick Montgomerie; they had one son. She died in 1952 and he then married Dorothy Moira Carling. He died in Oxford on 11 August 1966. His second wife survived him.<br>
