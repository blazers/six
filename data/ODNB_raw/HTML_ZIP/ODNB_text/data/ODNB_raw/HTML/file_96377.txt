<span class="headword">Harding,  (Thomas) Walter</span>  (1843&#150;1927), <span class="occ">pin manufacturer and civic art patron</span>, was born in Lille, France, on 22 January 1843, the only son and second of four children of Thomas Richards Harding (1812&#150;1895), manufacturer, of Leeds, Yorkshire, and Doddington, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Sarah Ann Cocker (1814&#150;1888), of Hathersage, near Sheffield. Educated at the lyc&eacute;e in Lille, where his father had established a factory and, from 1857, at Leeds grammar school, Yorkshire, following his father's acquisition of a second factory there (1853), he became an associate in arts through the Oxford local examinations, specializing in British constitutional history, before studying German in Dresden (1860&#150;61). He then returned to the family firm, which made steel pins and other components for textile machinery. On 19 May 1869 he married Anne Heycock (1846&#150;1923), daughter of Ambrose Edmund Heath Buckley Butler, ironmaster, of Kirkstall, Leeds; they had a son, born in Leeds in 1870, and a daughter, who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Harding became chairman of the family business, which as well as producing components for the textile industry made pins for gramophones, engine counters, and speed indicators. The business was incorporated in 1892 as a limited company, T. R. Harding &amp; Son, and, after his father's death (1895) and an amalgamation, this became Harding, Richardson and Rhodes &amp; Co. He invented machinery, and travelled widely for business and pleasure in Europe, north Africa, and America.<br>
<br>Harding played a significant role in the civic life of industrial Leeds, helping to influence its public face. He was a high church Anglican; his faith was strengthened during his youth in France, as was his interest in public order, his taste in public art, and his commitment to art and technical instruction for British manufacturing industries to remain competitive. His early interest in constitutional history, particularly its medieval origins, and in civic pageantry also influenced his public art patronage, for which he was noted. Art and industry were joined first for Harding in the design of the extraction shafts at his family's factory, the Tower Works, Holbeck; fashionably uniting function and beauty, the three shafts, built between 1864 and 1919, reflected Italian Renaissance campaniles and remain a Leeds landmark. Harding generously pursued civic building initiatives; as a young man he was secretary of the Social Improvement Society, and founded the Industrial Dwellings Company to improve housing. He and his father helped found Leeds Grand Theatre and supported the Yorkshire College, later Leeds University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate (1909). In 1880 he was elected to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers and was active in Leeds's Philosophical and Literary Society and chamber of commerce, becoming vice-president (1890&#150;91) and president (1892&#150;3) of the latter. From 1895 he chaired the West Riding rivers board, and in 1898 he was appointed to the royal commission on river pollution and trade effluent. He styled himself Colonel T. Walter Harding when the Leeds artillery volunteers, which organization he served from 1862 to 1895, bestowed that honorary title on him at his retirement.<br>
<br>In politics Harding was a Liberal who became a Unionist. He was president of the Leeds branch of the Imperial Federation League (1882) and was elected to Leeds council for Headingley ward as a Liberal (1883&#150;8). Influenced by Joseph Chamberlain, Harding joined the Unionists over home rule (1886) and thrust his energies into establishing an art gallery as part of Leeds's jubilee celebrations, achieved (1888) through public subscriptions; Harding provided a &pound;2000 collections fund. As chairman (1887&#150;1904) he acquired a public platform and gave artworks displaying romantic patriotic and religious themes. He stated at its inauguration that Leeds, &#145;with its great reputation &hellip; for its cloths, its iron, and its machinery, was practically unknown in the higher sphere of art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, 4 Oct 1888). Henceforth Harding's political, business, philanthropic, and artistic interests entwined. When in 1895 the Conservatives, pursuing a policy of promoting prominent local men to national office, won a majority on the Leeds city council for the first time in sixty years, Harding became alderman and set his sights on parliament.<br>
<br>To commemorate Leeds's elevation from township to city status (1893) Harding proposed and offered to finance (1896) an ambitious bronze sculpture scheme for the new City Square, comprising eight nude female figure-lamps representing Morn and Even by Alfred Drury (celebrating Leeds's adoption of electric street lighting) encircling an equestrian statue of Edward, the Black Prince, by Thomas Brock, chosen as a founding father of parliamentary traditions and to rival Joan of Arc at a time of imperial rivalry with France. To gain local support Harding added four worthies associated with Leeds: Dean Walter Hook (by Frederick Pomeroy), Joseph Priestley (by Drury), and James Watt and John Harrison (by Henry Fehr), endorsing loyalty to the crown and Anglicanism, with a concession to nonconformity, philanthropy, scientific innovation, and industrial technology. Costing some &pound;5000, the equestrian statue, unusually, took seven years to complete.<br>
<br>Harding was lord mayor of Leeds (1898&#150;9), helped organize the city's trades exhibits at the Brussels International Exhibition (1898), and was the chamber of commerce representative for the British section of the Paris International Exhibition (1900); the art gallery sent bronze artwork to both. Having promoted Unionist parliamentary candidates for a decade, he stood in the general election of 1900 as Unionist candidate for the Leeds West constituency against the sitting Liberal MP, Herbert Gladstone, but lost by 521 votes. His &#145;khaki&#146; election champion, the Black Prince, was incomplete; City Square's inauguration occurred in 1903, when the Anglo-French antagonism had waned.<br>
<br>In 1901 Harding was appointed high sheriff of the counties of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, leaving Abbey House (originally Kirkstall Abbey's gatehouse) for Hartsholme Hall, Lincolnshire (1902), and Madingley Hall, Cambridgeshire (1906), which he restored. There Harding wrote historical romances and chaired Addenbrooke's Hospital building committee. He belonged to the committee for the county, university, and town war memorial in Cambridge and also helped to organize Leeds's war memorial campaign (1920&#150;22). He died in office as high steward of Cambridge at Madingley Hall on 26 March 1927 and was buried at the church of St Mary Magdalene, Madingley, on 29 March.<br>
