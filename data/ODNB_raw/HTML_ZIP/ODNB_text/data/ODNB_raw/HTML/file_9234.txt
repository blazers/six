<span class="headword">Fead,  George</span>  (1728/9&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was probably a member of the Feads of Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire, several of whom settled in London as merchants. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet on 1 September 1756 and became a lieutenant-fireworker in the Royal Artillery on 8 June 1757. In that capacity he was sent to America and saw action at the siege of Louisburg, Cape Breton, in 1758. He was then taken prisoner in Newfoundland, was exchanged, and returned to England. He returned to America and continued to rise through the ranks from second lieutenant on 21 March 1760 to lieutenant on 25 May 1764. After serving for six or seven years in America he returned home.<br>
<br>Fead was promoted captain-lieutenant on 1 January 1771. On 3 February 1772 he married Elizabeth Kirkpatrick in Dumfriesshire and from 1774 to 1781 served at Minorca, where he was promoted to captain on 7 July 1779. During the siege of Minorca he commanded the artillery defending Fort St Philip and lost the sight of an eye. He was a witness at the court martial of Lieutenant-General James Murray, the garrison commander. He became brevet major on 19 March 1783 and in 1790 he went again to Newfoundland, staying for nearly two years. On 16 November 1792 he became regimental major, and on 5 December 1793 lieutenant-colonel. In 1793&#150;4 he served under Prince Frederick, duke of York, in Flanders. In 1799 he went to Jamaica in command of the Royal Artillery, being made lieutenant-general on 25 July 1810, and afterwards lieutenant-governor of Port Royal.<br>
<br>Fead died at his home on Woolwich Common on 20 November 1815 aged eighty-six, and in the fifty-eighth year of his military service, thirty of these being abroad. He had nine sons, at least three of whom predeceased him on active duty in the armed forces. In his will he referred to his wife, five sons and a married daughter, money in the funds, and some land in West Florida.<br>
