<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Villiers,  Charles Pelham</span>  (1802&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 3 January 1802 in Grosvenor Street, London, the third son of George Villiers (1759&#150;1827) and his wife, Theresa Parker (1775&#150;1856), the only daughter of John, first Baron Boringdon, and his second wife, Theresa, daughter of Thomas, first Lord Grantham. His sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16595/', "Lady (Maria) Theresa Lewis (1803&#150;1865)")</script>. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28302/', "Thomas Villiers, first earl of Clarendon")</script>. With the Parker and Villiers families later co-residing at Kent House, Knightsbridge, Villiers was brought up in a lively political home, where Canning was a frequent visitor. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28297/', "George William Frederick Villiers")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28303/', "Thomas Hyde Villiers")</script> were his elder brothers. He attended the Kensington school of Thomas Wright Hill before going to East India College, Haileybury, Hertfordshire, with India beckoning as a career. As a result of poor health, he went instead to St John's College, Cambridge, matriculating in Michaelmas term 1820, graduating BA in 1824, and proceeding MA in 1827. He presided over the union in 1822 with Macaulay, Howick (third Earl Grey), W. M. Praed, and Charles Austin among his circle. In 1823 he entered Lincoln's Inn, and qualified for the bar in 1827.<br>
<br>The law was to prove Villiers's main financial stay until the late 1850s but these early years also permanently marked his political vision. At Haileybury he had been taught by Thomas Malthus and Sir James Mackintosh; in London he heard John McCulloch lecture, and with his brothers, he was soon deeply involved in a number of &#145;March of Mind&#146; societies, discussing issues such as population, the poor law, and Owenite co-operation. This brought him into touch with the Benthamites and J. S. Mill but Villiers, unlike his brothers, acquired increasingly radical political views. However, it was as a liberal tory inspired by Huskisson that he contested Hull in 1826, reputedly on the cry of &#145;Cheap Bread&#146;, the theme that would shape his life. While George had become a commissioner of customs in 1823, and Hyde had been elected for Hedon in 1826, Charles, considered by some the most brilliant, if also the most difficult, of the brothers, took the western circuit and served as secretary to the master of the rolls in 1830. In 1832 his intellectual interests were well suited to his appointment as an assistant poor-law commissioner, investigating the midland and western counties, and he also acquired at first hand a knowledge of London's slums. Villiers became a convinced supporter of the new poor law, for whose administration he would later be responsible. In 1833 he was appointed examiner of witnesses in the court of chancery, a well-paid if relatively onerous post which he held until 1852. This gave him sufficient financial security to sustain his political career, for otherwise he was largely dependent upon an income generously allowed him by his elder brother (and subsequently by his heir). He also dabbled in the stock market and was for many years a director of the General Life Assurance Company.<br>
<br>Villiers entered parliament for Wolverhampton in 1835, for while his association with the new poor law proved a handicap, Wolverhampton was primarily a strong centre of opposition to the corn laws, led by its MPs Richard Fryer and William Wolryche Whitmore. Villiers formed a successful constituency partnership with the Liverpool merchant Thomas Thornely, standing as a free-trader and radical, and acting with the philosophical radicals in parliament. Above all, he readily took up opposition to the corn laws as his parliamentary m&eacute;tier, working with the London Anti-Corn Law Association and in 1836 seconding William Clay's motion for a fixed duty of 10<i>s</i>. on corn. At the election of 1837 in Wolverhampton Villiers pledged himself to move for total repeal, which he did for the first time on 15 March 1838. By this time other cities had also become active in the movement against the corn laws, and with the formation of the Manchester Anti-Corn Law Association in September 1838, Villiers was soon the parliamentary pivot of the free-trade movement, ready to co-ordinate action with the provinces. Having banqueted in Manchester in January 1839, he urged that its anti-cornlaw campaigners be heard at the bar of the house in February, and in March, prompting a lengthy debate, proposed for the second time total repeal of the corn laws. Villiers now became an extremely forceful advocate in parliament of free trade, renewing his motion for repeal of the corn laws in April and May 1840, but also bolstering the cause by his part in the highly influential select committee on import duties, nominally chaired by Joseph Hume, whose work Villiers in effect took over. As the spokesman for the radical extra-parliamentary movement, and a seeming rebel to his class, Villiers was placed in a difficult position with regard to the whigs, as they showed a growing readiness to support freer but not completely free trade, and his conspicuous advocacy of total repeal cost him many personal and political friendships.<br>
<br>With the return of an even stronger protectionist majority in the election of 1841 (only 90 voted for Villiers's repeal motion in 1842, compared with 177 in 1840), Villiers was increasingly identified with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>, performing &#145;a manly part&#146; in its out-of-doors work  (A. Prentice, <span class="italic">History of the Anti-Corn Law League</span>, 1853, 2.101). His annual motions were important not so much for the recruits they made as for the opportunity to rehearse, with growing sophistication, the case for total repeal. These set pieces focused a national debate, allowing the Anti-Corn Law League to orchestrate its campaigns and exert pressure upon parliament in a way that would slowly erode the protectionist majority. Villiers, however, by no means always agreed with the tactics of the league and found more palatable the milder views of James Wilson, with whom he struck up a strong friendship and whom he assisted in setting up <span class="italic">The Economist</span> in 1843. With the return to parliament of the league's leader Cobden in 1841, Villiers gradually ceded the leadership of the free trade party, especially as Cobden, and later Bright, rose into talented and inspiring political orators. As a result, when the corn laws were finally repealed in 1846, Villiers and his friends felt that his pioneering role was not given sufficient due, and Cobden himself recognized &#145;I have trod upon his heels, nay, almost trampled him down, in a race where he was once the sole man on the course&#146;  (<span class="italic">Free Trade Speeches</span>, 1.lxvii). However, Villiers did not bear grudges. He formed a lasting political rapport with Bright, and his outwardly successful alliance with the league was confirmed by his election for South Lancashire in 1847. Claiming poverty, Villiers sensibly stuck to Wolverhampton, and was to remain its MP until his death, forming the longest continuous link between MP and constituency in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Britain.<br>
<br>After 1846 Villiers was never to recapture the political limelight that he had hitherto enjoyed, especially as Lord John Russell&#151;for whom the Villiers family were never true whigs&#151;declined to give him an important office in 1846 (although he was considered as governor of Bombay, until vetoed by the East India Company). He remained a strong radical, urging further parliamentary reform and especially the ballot, but he also became embroiled in the feud between Edwin Chadwick and the Villiers and Lewis families over the administration of the new poor law following the Andover workhouse scandal. In 1852 he once more acted with the Manchester school, urging in the debate that closed the corn law issue that repeal should be recognized as &#145;wise, just, and beneficial&#146;. On this occasion Palmerston's milder resolution won the day, and Villiers was later distanced from his league allies, believing for example that the Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1860 was a breach of the unilateral free trade principles of 1846; by 1861 Cobden noted &#145;I seem to feel as if we had never a thought in common, instead of our having been seven years in constant correspondence&#146;  (Cobden to Bright, 14 Oct 1861, BL, Add. MS 43651, fol. 262).<br>
<br>In 1852, after his &#145;eighteenth year of unrequited toil in that House&#146;  (Villiers to Cobden, 27 Dec 1852, Cobden MSS, 10, W. Sussex RO), Villiers's career took a new turn as he eventually achieved significant (and well-paid) office under Aberdeen, that of judge-advocate-general, a position he also held under Palmerston (1855&#150;8). In 1853&#150;4 Villiers also chaired an important select committee on public houses, which proved a benchmark in subsequent debate. Its report was considered too &#145;free-trading&#146; by a growing band of temperance critics but Villiers, who had no great faith in governments making men moral, rejected undue restrictions on drink until rational recreation was available for the working classes. In the 1850s Villiers enjoyed considerable influence in the Commons from his radical past, was very much a fixture in London society, and was extremely well-informed politically, &#145;always sensible, unprejudiced and the most satisfactory person to talk to&#146;, according to the Whig diarist Greville  (L. Strachey and R. Fulford, <span class="italic">The Greville Memoirs, 1814&#150;1860</span>, 1938, 7.351). His eventual appointment to the cabinet as president of the poor-law board in 1859 considerably strengthened Palmerston's first &#145;liberal&#146; government, while providing for Villiers a post at last fully commensurate with his interests and talent.<br>
<br>For, as his legal career had shown, Villiers had a capacity for drudgery, and ably served by officials, especially Sir John Lambert and Sir Robert Rawlinson, his tenure at the poor-law board was marked by the most important series of reforms since 1834. First, the crisis in poor relief in London in the winter of 1860&#150;61 led to Villiers setting up a select committee, which he chaired over three parliamentary sessions and whose evidence led ultimately to the <span class="roman">Union Chargeability Act</span> of 1865. This act, still described by Beatrice and Sidney Webb in 1929 as &#145;the latest measure substantially changing the Poor Law&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Poor Law History</span>, 3.431), made the union, not the parish, the unit of financial responsibility, a reform of vital importance in London but one that also helped to undermine the negligence of landlords in closed rural parishes. Second, the report of the committee set in train a series of reforms in London's poor-law relief, with the extension of the board's authority over committees set up under local acts, the establishment of a common fund for relief of the casual poor, and the equalization of metropolitan poor rates. These reforms, in the pipeline under Villiers, were largely embodied in the <span class="roman">Metropolitan Poor Law Act</span> of 1867. Villiers, open to persuasion by Florence Nightingale, also began important steps for the reform of nursing within the poor law. Third, Villiers's association with Lancashire was renewed when the poor law proved unequal to the demands placed on it by the cotton famine of 1861&#150;5. Villiers met this crisis in a remarkably flexible manner, foreshadowing the <span class="roman">Union Chargeability Act</span> by allowing parishes to seek union or even county-wide support and by allowing unions to raise loans. More innovatively, the <span class="roman">Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act</span> (1863) fostered job-creating public health schemes, which although by no means equal to the extent of unemployment had important multiplier effects on the local economy. Interestingly, Villiers refused to encourage emigration schemes but did eventually relax the labour test for poor relief. Finally, Villiers was responsible for a variety of other measures, including the <span class="roman">Union Assessment Act</span> of 1862 (giving power to assess rates to committees, not underqualified overseers), and the irremovability of paupers after one year's residence, and he prepared the ground for the poor-law board to become a permanent part of the machinery of government. Villiers's administrative pragmatism combined with political nous did much to give shape to the poor law into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Villiers's contribution to the poor law was therefore a notable, if unsung, success, belying his reputation as a political weathercock, more interested in gossip than policy-making. He also played an important part in further parliamentary reform, for it fell to his board to prepare the electoral statistics upon which the reform bills of the 1860s were based. Villiers guardedly supported an extensive measure, ultimately preferring the claims of democracy to those of plutocracy, for while he always had a strong confidence in aristocratic rule, he was far more critical of Mammon than of the masses.<br>
<br>After the second <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, Villiers's political career withered, partly overshadowed by the greater stature of his brother the earl of Clarendon but most probably because of the antipathy between Villiers and &#145;the old devil&#146; Gladstone. For while Gladstone and Villiers shared a common acquaintance with the reformed prostitute Laura Thistlethwayte (at whose salon they often met), Gladstone had often been the butt of Villiers's caustic wit, and in 1868 he omitted Villiers from his cabinet, ostensibly on the ground that two brothers could not sit in the cabinet (as they had previously done in those of Palmerston and Russell). Villiers's later mark therefore was confined to his chairmanship in 1871 of the select committee on conventual and monastic institutions, where he had little truck with the anti-Catholic prejudices of Charles Newdegate and whose report paradoxically pointed towards the further removal of Catholic disabilities. Villiers remained a frequent attender at the Political Economy Club (to which he had been elected in 1847), a pillar of the Reform Club, and a noted social personality, ill-dressed but witty, informed, civilized, at times mischievous, well loved in his family circle, and widely popular outside it. He declined a peerage in 1885.<br>
<br>Villiers by the late 1870s had in fact become more important as a political symbol than as an active participant in the house, a position recognized by the erecting of a statue to him in Wolverhampton in 1879, an unusual honour for a living politician. Against the background of the fair-trade movement too, Villiers's past career was celebrated by the publication of his <span class="italic">Free Trade Speeches</span>, an edition prepared by Agnes Lambert, the daughter of Sir John. Her projected biography of Villiers was never published. Villiers also remained a conscientious, if absentee, local MP, keeping closely in touch with constituency activists and making the issue of redistribution in Wolverhampton the subject of his last speech in the House of Commons in 1885. In 1886 he supported the Liberal Unionists, distrusting the leadership of Gladstone, an abiding antagonism still strongly voiced in the 1890s. &#145;Father of the House&#146;, Villiers was re-elected in 1892 and 1895 but rarely attended the Commons save to vote against home rule. On the jubilee of the repeal of the corn laws in 1896 he was presented with a commemorative address by the Cobden Club and replied with a lucid defence of free trade since 1846 but was too ill to attend the celebrations. In his declining years, frail but alert, he retained a lively interest in politics, observing the operation of parish councils and the rise of the Independent Labour Party, supporting women's suffrage, reading the newspapers thoroughly, and maintaining an extensive correspondence. For the last thirty years of his life Villiers, who had never married, was looked after by his housekeeper, Maria Walsh. He died of a severe cold, following his ninety-sixth birthday celebrations, on 16 January 1898 at his home, 50 Cadogan Place, London. He was buried at Kensal Green on 20 January.<br>
<br>Villiers left a large hoard of papers and a considerable personal fortune. His vast correspondence was reputedly destroyed by his housekeeper, to whom he had bequeathed it. His wealth, over &pound;350,000, occasioned surprise and a minor political outcry. For he had received (and carefully guarded from Gladstonian frugality) a pension of &pound;2000 p.a. on the grounds of income insufficient to sustain his former cabinet rank, lamenting on leaving office in 1866 &#145;I have always been unlucky and I am worse off now than when I began thirty-one years ago&#146;  (Villiers to Mrs Anne Graham, July 1866, BL, Add. MS 48214). His change of fortune may have been largely due to the legacy he received in 1880 from a family friend, Catherine Mellish, which included a life interest in a 2000 acre Hertfordshire estate (Hamels Park), sold in 1884 to the textile bleacher H. S. Cross.<br>
