<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Worms,  Henry  De</span>, first Baron Pirbright  (1840&#150;1903), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 20 October 1840, the youngest child of Baron Solomon Benedict De Worms (1801&#150;1882) and his wife, Henrietta, eldest daughter of Samuel Moses Samuel. Solomon De Worms was descended from a wealthy Frankfurt Jewish family, which had settled in London in the early nineteenth century; Solomon's mother was a sister of Nathan Meyer Rothschild, the first of the Rothschild family to settle in England. Solomon and his brothers were the owners of extensive tea plantations in Ceylon; in 1871 Solomon was made a baron of the Austrian empire, and in 1874 Queen Victoria gave him and his descendants permission to use the title in England, in recognition of his work in Ceylon.<br>
<br>De Worms was educated at King's College, London, of which he became a fellow in 1873, and at the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1863, practising at the Kent sessions. Subsequently, however, he gave up the law to assist in the management of his father's business, which he did until its dissolution in 1879. His interests had already turned in a political direction. Through his friendship with the Austrian ambassador in London, Count von Beust, he had in 1867 obtained an introduction to Benjamin Disraeli; the following year he stood as Conservative candidate at Sandwich, thus becoming the first professing Jew to stand for election to parliament in the Conservative interest&#151;a feat which earned him a great deal of Jewish communal disapprobation at the time, since the Conservatives had earlier opposed the abolition of Jewish disabilities. Ironically, however, the Sandwich election was marked by some blatantly antisemitic propaganda emanating from the Liberal side; in the event De Worms was unsuccessful, and did not stand at the general election of 1874 which brought Disraeli to power&#151;and which saw the return of the obscure Nottingham coal owner, Saul Isaac, as the first professing Jewish Conservative MP. In 1880, however, De Worms was returned for Greenwich, and from 1885 to his elevation to the peerage a decade later he sat for the East Toxteth division of Liverpool.<br>
<br>De Worms's knowledge of the international commodity market was prodigious, and earned him a place in Lord Salisbury's first administration (1885&#150;6) as parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade. In the second Salisbury government (1886&#150;92) he held office first at the Board of Trade and then, from 1888, as under-secretary of state for the colonies. In 1887 he had been elected president of the international conference on sugar bounties, and the following year toured a number of European capitals urging the abolition of the bounty system; to his great regret the British parliament refused to ratify the convention in which the conference had resulted.<br>
<br>De Worms was a man of many talents&#151;a fine speaker, an accomplished pugilist&#151;but also had a reputation as a bore (&#145;Baron de Bookworms&#146;). A fellow of the Royal Society, he was the author of a treatise on <span class="italic">The Earth and its Magnetism</span> (1862) as well as of studies of <span class="italic">The Austro-Hungarian Empire</span> (1870) and <span class="italic">England's Policy in the East</span> (1877). From an early age he had been brought up to expect to take an active part in Jewish communal affairs. He held the posts of treasurer (1872) and vice-president (1880&#150;82) of the United Synagogue in London, and from 1872 to 1886 served as president of the Anglo-Jewish Association, which practically conducted the foreign policy of Anglo-Jewry at this period. In 1886, however, his daughter, Alice, married out of the faith; worse still, he saw fit to attend her church wedding. This led to his being forced to resign the presidency of the Anglo-Jewish Association, and seems to have planted the seeds of a gradual estrangement from his fellow Jews and from their faith. De Worms, though not a strictly observant Jew, had identified himself very closely with the Jewish world. In parliament he had taken up the causes of the oppressed Jewries of Romania and Russia. Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler's wife, Henrietta, was his second cousin, both his own wives were Jewish, and it is clear that he had originally intended for himself a Jewish burial. However, he grew increasingly bitter at his exclusion from the inner circle of the Anglo-Jewish gentry, and his failure to be included (1901) in the list of those Jewish leaders who were deputed to congratulate Edward VII on his accession to the throne may have been the final straw. When he died, in 1903, he left instructions that he was to be buried in a Christian cemetery.<br>
<br>On 5 May 1864 De Worms married Fanny, eldest daughter of Baron von Todesco, of Vienna, with whom he had three daughters and from whom he obtained a divorce in 1886; on 25 January 1887 he married Sarah Barnett (<i>d</i>. 1914), the only daughter of Sir Benjamin Samuel Phillips, and his wife, Rachel. De Worms died at 42 Grosvenor Place, London, on 9 January 1903, and was buried in the churchyard of Wyke St Mark, near Guildford, Surrey; as he left no male heir, his title became extinct.<br>
