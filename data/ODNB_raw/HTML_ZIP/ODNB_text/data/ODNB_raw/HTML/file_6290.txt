<span class="headword">Corbett,  Miles</span>  (1594/5&#150;1662), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was probably born in Sprowston, Norfolk, where several generations of the Corbett family are buried, the second son of Sir John Corbett, baronet (<i>d</i>. 1628), who married a daughter of Sir Arthur Capel. A pedigree compiled between 1655 and 1659 lists Thomas Corbett, usually referred to as Miles's father, as his great-uncle; Sir Thomas Corbett, Miles's elder brother, was still living in the 1650s. Miles Corbett matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1612, and subsequently was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. His father was imprisoned for nearly a year in Westminster gatehouse for refusing to pay or support the collection of the forced loan of 1628: Miles was recorder of, and in 1628 MP for, Great Yarmouth, where he prepared a petition calling for the town to be excused payment of the loan.<br>
<br>Corbett was elected for Great Yarmouth in the Short and Long parliaments of 1640. Edmund Ludlow praised him for &#145;joyning constantly with those who most eminently appeared for the cause of God and their country&#146; over thirty-seven years. As a close colleague, Ludlow appears to have had access to Corbett's posthumous &#145;confession&#146;  (Ludlow, <span class="italic">Voyce</span>, 300). Corbett's opinion of his own diligent and faithful service stemmed from the many committees on which he efficiently served, as did his opponents' accusations of Corbett's arbitrariness, and a posthumous reputation as a cynical self-server. He chaired the committee which prepared a bill against scandalous ministers (22 March 1641), the committee for examinations, and that which drew up charges against Archbishop Laud. In 1644 he was created one of two clerks of the court of wards and, with Robert Goodwin, was granted the registrar's office in chancery in place of Walter Long in 1648.<br>
<br>Corbett was a target of presbyterian stalwarts who responded to radical Independents who deprecated their commitment to liberties by accusing men like Corbett of arbitrary, self-seeking tactics. Denzil Holles called Corbett's committee for examinations a &#145;continual horse-fair &hellip; even like dooms-day itself, to judge persons of all sorts and sexes&#146;  (Holles, 1.265). Corbett was also satirized in 1645 in <span class="italic">A most learned speech spoken in the House of Commons by Miles Corbet, taken in short hand by his clarkes</span>. The presbyterians accused Independents of captious proceedings which furnished huge estates, while the latter protested that their constancy had wasted them.<br>
<br>Corbett was named to the high court of justice to try Charles I, attended one session, and signed Charles's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. In October 1650 he was appointed one of four civil commissioners in Ireland, landing in Waterford in late 1650. A carefully worded letter to the commanders in Ireland presented Cromwell's assumption of power in 1653 as a sign of God's displeasure at the progress of his reformation, but Corbett kept his place under the protectorate. Appointed to the council in Ireland in August 1654, he opposed Irish elections that year, claiming unsettled military and climatic conditions. As a member of the council he was appointed one of its commissioners to hear and determine cases of proposed transplantation to Connaught. In July 1655 he was created chief baron of the exchequer of Ireland.<br>
<br>Corbett's religious stance was shaped as one of a group of gentlemen at the inns of court influenced by the preaching of Preston and Ussher, and he was a particular friend of the Independent divine William Bridge. His extant professions, albeit composed shortly before his death, testified to his submission to providence, citing it as the key to his political actions. As an Irish commissioner he tried to use calls for days of humiliation to rally the godly, warning that the Lord should not find any &#145;beateing his fellow servants&#146;  (J. Mayer, &#145;Inedited letters of Cromwell, Colonel Jones, Bradshaw and other regicides&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Historic Society</span>, new ser., 1861, 239&#150;41, 241&#150;3, 258&#150;60).<br>
<br>Under the restored Rump, Corbett regained the post of Irish commissioner, managing the affairs of the army, and conducting a campaign described by Clarendon as the systematic replacement of presbyterians. Yet men such as Corbett were &#145;odious to the army as well to the people&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 213), enabling presbyterians and royalists to move against them. In December 1659 (along with Ludlow and his fellow commissioners Jones and Tomlinson) Corbett was impeached by Sir Charles Coote, president of Connaught, for maintaining in Ireland the interest of the republican party in England.<br>
<br>Corbett was returned for Great Yarmouth for the Convention Parliament in 1660, but lost his place in a double return. He then fled to the Netherlands, where he was betrayed by Sir George Downing, later expressing his bitterness towards a state supposedly sympathetic to the English republic. He was imprisoned in the Tower, dragged on a sledge to Tyburn, one of nine regicides to be partially hanged, disembowelled, and quartered and died, aged sixty-seven, on 19 April 1662, &#145;very cheerfully&#146; and unrepentant  (Pepys, 3.66). He described himself as grey-haired and, while escaping most scabrous, anti-Rump satire, was deemed &#145;bull-headed, splay-footed, bacon-faced Corbet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lucifer's Lifeguard</span>, 1662). He was close to his wife, Mary, who survived him, and had several children including a son, John, to whom he wrote the day before his death that he bequeathed him his cause and his faith, but no estate.<br>
