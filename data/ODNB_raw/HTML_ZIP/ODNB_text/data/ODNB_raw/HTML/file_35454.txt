</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peers, Sir  Charles Reed</span>  (1868&#150;1952), <span class="occ">architect and archaeologist</span>, was born on 22 September 1868 at Westerham, Kent, the eldest son of the Revd William Henry Peers (1839&#150;1921), then curate at Westerham and later vicar of Harrow Weald, Middlesex, and lord of the manor of Chiselhampton, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Dora Patience, daughter of William Carr of Dene Park, Tonbridge, Kent. Peers was educated at Charterhouse School and in 1887 went to King's College, Cambridge, where he gained second classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1890, 1891), after which he studied briefly at Dresden and Berlin. In 1893 he became a pupil in the office of Thomas Graham Jackson, who encouraged his interest in medieval architecture. After three years with Jackson Peers spent a season in Egypt, working with George Somers Clarke at al-Qab and elsewhere before practising as an architect on his own account for six years, including a return visit to Egypt in 1902.<br>
<br>In 1903 Peers was appointed architectural editor to the recently founded <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span> and helped to develop its approach to the recording of historic buildings. Responsible for supervising a team of architects working on the topographical volumes, Peers produced phased period plans and concise descriptions of the buildings surveyed for the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>. These set the standard for the methodology adopted by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments after its creation in 1908. For the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span> Peers himself wrote the descriptions and drew the plans of a number of major buildings, including Winchester Cathedral and St Albans Abbey.<br>
<br>From 1900 to 1903 Peers was editor of the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span> and in 1901 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1908 he became its secretary, a position he held until becoming director in 1921. These honorary posts undoubtedly strengthened his candidacy for the post of inspector of ancient monuments in HM office (later Ministry) of Works, to which he was appointed in 1910, being promoted to the post of chief inspector following the <span class="roman">Ancient Monuments Act</span> of 1913. This act, in the preparation of which Peers played a leading role, consolidated those of 1882 and 1900 and was prompted in part by the threatened dismantling and export of Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, to the United States in 1911. Although still excluding from protection churches in use and private houses, the act reflected increasing public concern over the proper preservation of ancient monuments and was the first to introduce an element of legal compulsion, making it necessary for owners of a scheduled monument to apply for permission from the state before altering or demolishing their property. It also empowered the government to assume guardianship of nationally important monuments and to maintain them at public expense.<br>
<br>It was in this official capacity that Peers was able to develop his own approach to the physical preservation of ruined medieval buildings. Rejecting equally the highly speculative and extensive restorations associated with Viollet-le-Duc in France and the conservative repairs advocated by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (founded in 1877), he transformed &#145;the mouldering ivy-clad ruin(s) of the Romantic tradition&#146;  (Ralegh Radford, 365) into well-managed and informative, if often somewhat clinically presented, archaeological sites. While careful not to add new masonry unless necessary to support historic fabric, the scale of work undertaken was frequently vast, exemplified by the extensive &#145;clearance&#146; during the 1920s of post-medieval building phases at monastic sites like Byland and Rievaulx in Yorkshire. Here fallen masonry was removed by labourers (many of them First World War veterans) along temporary light railway lines expressly constructed for the purpose. If many buildings were as a result robbed of their picturesque quality and much of their post-medieval construction history, the ministry's involvement ensured that still more was protected from further decay or deliberate vandalism. Indeed, the principles of repair and consolidation adopted by Peers and his colleagues remained largely unchallenged on guardianship sites until the late 1970s.<br>
<br>The stern puritanism with which Peers laid bare the ground plans and masonry footings of the abbeys and castles set in the manicured lawns, which became the hallmark of ministry sites, is matched in the many official guidebooks he wrote, their spare and economical texts recording the essential events in a site's history and concisely describing its architectural remains. These, along with his many excavation reports and earlier accounts of buildings for the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>, represent Peers's main written output, as he never wrote a major book.<br>
<br>Peers's retirement from the ministry in 1933 was preceded by the <span class="roman">Ancient Monuments Act</span> of 1931, which in the wake of quarrying immediately around Hadrian's Wall established the concept of protecting the setting of ancient monuments as well as their physical fabric. During his retirement, when according to his own assessment he was busier and better off than he had ever been as a civil servant, Peers was in much demand as a consultant architect, becoming surveyor to Westminster Abbey in 1935. He held similar posts at York and Durham, where as architect-in-charge he was responsible too for pinning the castle to the rock from which it was slipping. Seneschal of Canterbury Cathedral, he also advised the dean and chapter at Winchester, sat on the Oxford diocesan committee, and carried out work for New College.<br>
<br>Numerous honours were bestowed on Peers, both before and after his retirement: he was made CBE in 1924 and was knighted in 1931 during his presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, a position he held between 1929 and 1934, being awarded its gold medal in 1938. The holder of honorary doctorates from Leeds and London universities (1933 and 1936 respectively), he was a governor of Charterhouse and an honorary fellow of King's College, Cambridge. In 1930 he was made a trustee of the London Museum and from 1933 a trustee of the British Museum. Antiquary to the Royal Academy from 1933 to 1952, he was also a fellow of the British Academy from 1926 and of the Royal Institute of British Architects, receiving its gold medal in 1933. In 1932 he was elected president of the first session of the Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences and during its second session at Oslo in 1936 was made a knight commander of St Olaf. Of the many committees on which he sat he was a particularly active member of the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, for which he was a commissioner from 1921.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1899 Peers married Gertrude Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of the late Francis Shepherd, vicar of Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, with whom he had three sons. Gertrude was an art historian and actively interested in his work. Inheriting the eighteenth-century Chiselhampton House in Oxfordshire from his father, Peers and Gertrude moved there in 1924 where in his spare time he tended the gardens and entertained his friends. Among these was George Hill, whom Peers had first met when they both applied for the same position at the British Museum in 1893; later Hill was to be director of the museum at the same time as Peers was one of its trustees. Peers got on well with many younger than himself and Mortimer Wheeler was among those he encouraged at an early stage of their careers.<br>
<br>A man of quick-witted charm, wide interests, and tremendous energy, Peers never suffered fools gladly but was usually prepared to listen to constructive criticism. Dogged by illness for the last seven years of his life, he maintained his antiquarian interests to the end, James Mann recalling that when he last visited him in the nursing home at Coulsdon, Surrey, he was reading the latest volume of the <span class="italic">Antiquaries Journal</span>. Peers died at Woodcote Grove House, Coulsdon, Surrey, on 16 November 1952 and at a funeral service conducted by the dean of Westminster on 21 November his ashes were placed in the abbey's Islip chapel.<br>
<br>Evaluations of Peers's contribution to the excavation and public presentation of medieval military and monastic sites, the area of work for which he is best remembered, have altered significantly in the past half-century. At the time of his death it appears that for his own contemporaries and the two succeeding generations of archaeologists, many of whom he had directly influenced, the standards he established as chief inspector of ancient monuments were beyond dispute. To them the perceived benefits of the wholesale clearance of vegetation and post-medieval deposits and accretions from medieval fabric were irrefutable: as James Mann commented in one obituary notice, Peers &#145;founded a school of conservation which was a model to the world and one earnestly hopes will long survive him&#146;  (Mann, 149). Similarly, in another obituary, while acknowledging that Peers's approach and methods had aroused some controversy when first introduced, Ralegh Radford felt that this was &#145;now a matter of historical rather than practical interest&#146;  (Ralegh Radford, 365).<br>
<br>Today's archaeologists are, however, generally less sympathetic, several strongly criticizing the way in which the extensive clearance of monastic sites in particular destroyed much evidence for their post-medieval use. Others have lamented the way in which the sites in Peers's care, characterized by their ruthlessly mown lawns and herbaceous borders, were stripped of their former romanticism and recently there has been a conscious effort to reconcile the sometimes conflicting interests of nature and building conservation in the public presentation of state-owned archaeological sites and monuments. Academically, too, Peers has been attacked, appearing in one recent work merely as one of a long list of &#145;male historians of male monasticism [who] claimed that sources for religious women were simply not available or adequate&#146;  (R. Gilchrist, <span class="italic">Gender &amp; Material Culture: the Archaeology of Religious Women</span>, 1994, 23). Others, though, such as Glyn Coppack, have been less severe and while regretting the damage caused by Peers's &#145;clearance&#146; policy on many sites, have acknowledged the pivotal role played by him in the preservation of monastic and other ruins and in their display and interpretation to a wide public.<br>
