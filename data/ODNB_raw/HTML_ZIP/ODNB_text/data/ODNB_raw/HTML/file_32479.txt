<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cohen,  Arthur</span>  (1829&#150;1914), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born in Wyndham Place, Bryanston Square, London, on 18 November 1829, the youngest son of Benjamin Cohen (1789&#150;1867), a prosperous bill broker. His grandfather, Levy Barent Cohen (1740&#150;1808), moved to London from Holland about 1770. Through his mother, Justina (1800&#150;1873), the youngest daughter of Joseph Eliahu Montefiore and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19042/', "Sir Moses Montefiore")</script>, he was connected with the great Jewish families of Montefiore and Mocatta. At an early age he was reading Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span>; when he was about twelve years old, he was sent to Frankfurt, where he was educated by a tutor and at the <i>Gymnasium</i>. At the age of seventeen he became a student at University College, London. His family wished to send him to Cambridge, but entrance to Trinity and Christ's colleges was found to be impossible for a Jew. His uncle, Sir Moses Montefiore, with the support of the prince consort as chancellor of the university, secured his admission to Magdalene, where he read mathematics, in 1849. Even then he had to undergo an entrance examination on William Paley's <span class="italic">View of the Evidences of Christianity</span>.<br>
<br>Cohen had not had much opportunity to mix with his contemporaries and, supported by a large allowance, he participated enthusiastically in undergraduate life. He was secretary of the Union Society in 1852 and its president in 1853, and he rowed for at least one year in the Magdalene boat. It was probably due to these diversions that his name appeared only as fifth wrangler in 1853, to the disappointment of his family. As a Jew he could not take his degree until after the passing of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Reform Act</span> of 1856, which abolished the obligatory Christian oath which had formerly preceded graduation. In 1858 Cohen became the first professing Jew to graduate at Cambridge, taking his MA in 1860. Later on the university made him further amends: from 1879 to 1914 he was counsel to the university, and from 1883 an honorary fellow of Magdalene College.<br>
<br>In November 1853 Cohen became a member of the Inner Temple. In May 1857 he won the studentship of the inns of court, and in November of the same year he was called to the bar. He practised on the home and, later, the south-east circuits. In his early years he was helped by his uncle, Sir Moses Montefiore, who bought a law library for his nephew, and, as chairman of the Alliance Assurance Company, put work his way. But Cohen, able and ambitious enough to succeed without backing, was soon busy, especially with commercial insurance and Admiralty cases. Commercial law was being adapted to meet the problems of increasing trade, and for many years Cohen appeared in nearly every important case. In 1872 he was selected by the attorney-general, Sir Roundell Palmer (Lord Selborne from October of that year), to be junior counsel for Great Britain in the <i>Alabama</i> arbitration at Geneva. In 1873 he was appointed by Chief Baron Kelly to the ancient post of &#145;tubman&#146; in the court of exchequer, having previously been &#145;postman&#146;. In the same year he was a member of the royal commission on unseaworthy ships, the result of the agitation of Samuel Plimsoll. In 1874 he became a queen's counsel, being the junior but one in a batch of fourteen. Thereafter, Cohen appeared frequently before the privy council and in the House of Lords. In 1875 he was appointed judge of the Admiralty court of Cinque Ports, a sinecure which he only resigned in the year of his death. In 1876 he became a bencher of the Inner Temple, and he held the office of treasurer in 1894. He became a member of the senate of the University of London in 1905, as a representative of the Inner Temple; he was reappointed in 1909 and 1913.<br>
<br>On 23 August 1860 Cohen married Emmeline Micholls (1843&#150;1888) of Manchester, to whom he had become engaged when she was only fifteen. It was a happy marriage which produced three sons and five daughters. One of the sons, Benjamin, became a distinguished barrister.<br>
<br>In February 1874 Cohen stood unsuccessfully for the borough of Lewes as a Liberal. In April 1880 he headed the poll at Southwark, his fellow member being the political economist J. E. Thorold Rogers. In February 1881 Lord Selborne offered him the senior of two judgeships then vacant. At the request of W. E. Gladstone, who feared a by-election in the borough, Cohen declined. There was, apparently, an understanding that Cohen should be offered a judgeship subsequently, but he never had another chance: and for many years new judges, answering letters of congratulation from Cohen, uniformly assured him that he ought long ago to have been on the bench himself. Cohen sat for Southwark from 1880 to 1888, being re-elected twice, in November 1885 and July 1886. Described in <span class="italic">Dod's Parliamentary Companion</span> as a &#145;sincere and earnest&#146; Liberal he favoured home rule, reform of bankruptcy law, and the establishment of a mercantile code. He was opposed to a hereditary House of Lords. He was not a successful Commons man, but though he spoke seldom, he was heard with respect and he exerted considerable influence behind the scenes. Even in court, Cohen's manner of speaking was somewhat artificial, and it was probably too drily analytical for the House of Commons, despite his employment of an elocution coach. A contemporary described his speech as &#145;smooth and persuasive&#146;, though with a tendency to &#145;drawl&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Nov 1914). In 1888 Cohen resigned his seat, chiefly because of the serious illness of his wife. In the June of that year he suffered a severe blow by her death.<br>
<br>Between 1893 and 1914 Cohen was standing counsel to the India Office. In 1903 he was counsel for Great Britain in the Venezuela arbitration at The Hague. In the same year he was made a fellow of the British Academy, chairman of the bar council, and a member of the royal commission on trade disputes and trade combinations, which reported in 1906&#151;not a bad record for a man of seventy-four. In 1905 he was made a privy councillor by the Conservative government. In 1906 he was appointed chairman of the royal commission on shipping rings. In 1911 he wrote the article on insurance in Lord Halsbury's <span class="italic">Laws of England</span>. This was his only published work of any length, and being upon a subject of which he had been long the acknowledged master it was one of the most valuable sections of that encyclopaedia. His lecture entitled <span class="italic">The Declaration of London</span> was also published in 1911.<br>
<br>Cohen continued his practice at the bar until about 1911, appearing at times with a junior who was born after his leader had taken silk. When he died, Halsbury alone was his senior among the benchers of his inn.<br>
<br>Cohen was a great lawyer, intelligent, industrious, and with a passion for legal principles. In dedicating to Cohen his <span class="italic">Conflict of Laws</span> (1896), A. V. Dicey said that his &#145;mastery of legal principles is surpassed only by the kindness with which his learning and experience are placed at the service of his friends&#146;. He was not a great advocate in open court, but for the argument of a question of law before an appellate tribunal he had few equals. In all probability, up to the time of his death, no advocate had so often addressed the House of Lords and the judicial committee.<br>
<br>Tall and handsome, with brown eyes and a mass of dark hair which kept its colour until he was well past seventy, Cohen was a kindly man, with the courteous and rather stately manners of a &#145;grand seigneur&#146;. Although reserved, he had many friends, and was universally esteemed by the members of the bar. His interests included literature and the theatre. Although he gave up playing the cello when he left Cambridge, he maintained his university passion for mathematics: within a few months of his death he was reading works on the differential calculus. Although he had a fine physique, Cohen was not athletic. He did, however, enjoy walking while on holiday in the Alps. He was a heavy smoker of cigars, and had a tendency to gout. He was a slow and conscientious worker; although his income&#151;even as a junior counsel&#151;was up to &pound;8000 p.a., he was never a rich man. About the acquisition of money he was as careless as he was lavish in spending it. His daughter recorded that he only once tried the experiment of riding in an omnibus; his brother, who died a millionaire, was never known to ride in anything else. Although Cohen ceased to be an &#145;observing&#146; Jew when he left his childhood home, he was always a professing Jew, and proud of the traditions of the race. Throughout his life he took an active part in Jewish affairs, especially in the fields of education and charity. For many years president of the Borough Jewish schools, he was vice-president of the Jews' College (1892&#150;1901) and president of the Meshibat Neplish Society (1873&#150;80). He also served on the council of the United Synagogue and the committee of the Jews' Free School. He was for fifteen years (1800&#150;1895) president of the Jewish board of deputies, resigning when the first of his children married outside the Jewish community. He died on 3 November 1914, at his home at 26 Great Cumberland Place, Hyde Park, London, and was buried by the side of his wife in the Jewish cemetery at Willesden.<br>
