<span class="headword">Maubray,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1732), <span class="occ">man-midwife</span>, was born probably in Scotland. Nothing is known of his early life. About 1724 or 1725 he set himself up in London as a teacher of midwifery. An unlicensed practitioner, he sought the patronage of Sir Hans Sloane, and such an eminent contact may have persuaded the Royal College of Physicians to ignore his lack of a licence. Maubray's first book was <span class="italic">The female physician, containing all the diseases incident to that sex, in virgins, wives and widows</span> (1724). His second book was <span class="italic">Midwifery Brought to Perfection by Manual Operation</span> (1725), in which he appealed for the founding of a lying-in hospital, becoming one of the first to do so. He wrote that there were many excellent hospitals but &#145;on this point of provision for poor miserable women in the time of their affliction, when they are in no case in a condition to help themselves we have been hitherto and are still deficient&#146;  (Spencer, 11). He cited the H&ocirc;tel Dieu in Paris as a suitable model. Maubray published his course on midwifery from his house in New Bond Street. He gave about twenty lectures between the hours of five and six twice a week; students engaged in practical work with patients, which allowed them to perform vaginal examinations (the touch) and conduct deliveries.<br>
<br>One object of Maubray's teaching was &#145;to confute and reject the barbarous and truly inhumane use of all <i>chirurgical tools</i>&#146;  (Spencer, 12). Practitioners were at that time acquiring knowledge of obstetric forceps, which Maubray probably was condemning, as he did all the other, much more barbarous instruments then being used in obstetric practice for difficult labours. According to Adrian Wilson, Maubray was among those whig men-midwives who opposed the use of forceps. He was the first to describe different shapes of bony pelvis, categorizing them as deep, large, broad, flat, oval, and round. He also coined the term &#145;andro-boethogynist&#146; to describe a male practitioner of midwifery.<br>
<br>Despite being a pioneer in the teaching of midwifery, writing about it, and proposing a lying-in hospital, there is evidence that Maubray did not have much practical experience for he says he was only called &#145;occasionally&#146; to births in London  (Spencer, 8). He travelled to Venice, Germany, and the Netherlands to learn more, and it was in the Netherlands, on a Zuyder Zee ferry, that he attended a woman, who, he said, produced a Moodiwarp, &#145;having a hooked snout, fiery sparkling eyes, a long round neck, an acuminated tail and an extraordinary agility of feet&#146;  (Spencer, 9); it yelled and shrieked like a demon and scooted round the deck finding a place to hide. Other evidence of his gullibility is that he accepted astrologers' views on the magic number seven, believing that babies born in the seventh month of pregnancy were stronger than those born in the eighth. Eight-month babies were ruled by Saturn, an enemy to all creatures that breathe life; Maubray said that they were always weakly, with tender constitutions, and often half-witted. It was because of his holding these views that his injunction &#145;to watch the patient during pregnancy so as to prevent all preternatural disasters&#146;  (Spencer, 8) was misinterpreted as his trying to prevent the birth of jumping rabbits and similar strange creatures. Maubray, who was also duped during the Mary Toft affair, was a mixture of the far-sighted and the credulous in midwifery.<br>
<br>Maubray was chairman of the Charitable Corporation in 1730, and in 1732 he drew the attention of the House of Commons to one of the members of his committee who was misappropriating funds on behalf of the Pretender. At his death, which occurred in London on 27 October 1732, Maubray was described in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as &#145;justly esteemed as an honest publick-spirited man&#146;  (Spencer, 14).<br>
