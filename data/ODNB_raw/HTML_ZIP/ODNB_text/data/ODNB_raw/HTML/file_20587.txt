<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  John</span>  (1732&#150;1813), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and poet</span>, was born on either 18 or 28 November 1732 in Aberdeen, and was baptized on 7 December at his father's church, St Nicholas's, in the town. He was the eldest of six children of James Ogilvie (1695&#150;1776), minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Strachan (<i>d</i>. 1778). He graduated from Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1750, and after a period studying, probably in Edinburgh, was licensed as a minister in the Church of Scotland on 16 July 1755. He was ordained to the parish of Lumphanan, south Aberdeenshire, on 15 March 1759, but was translated to the neighbouring parish of Midmar, 15 miles west of Aberdeen, on 27 March 1760. He remained as minister there for fifty-three years and was noted as a kindly, mild-mannered pastor &#145;with all the simplicity of a child&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>). He married, on 22 January 1771, Margaret (Peggy) Reid (1751/2&#150;1804), daughter of Patrick Reid, minister of Clatt, Aberdeenshire; they had eleven children. He had an early literary friendship with James Beattie; David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, advised on and corrected some of his works. He travelled to London several times, and is unfairly remembered principally as the butt of Samuel Johnson's remark, at a dinner party in 1763, that &#145;the noblest prospect that a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.425). Ogilvie recorded that, contrary to Boswell's account, he had been a diffident young guest, who only ventured on a gentle defence of some aspects of Scotland in reply to a prolonged disparagement by Johnson who, he discovered, had never yet been there  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>, 355).<br>
<br>Ogilvie was a prolific and varied writer in poetry and prose. His earliest published poems, including <span class="italic">The Day of Judgment</span> (published 1753), were written before the age of seventeen. Other early verse included odes and elegies, but his poems became progressively longer and more ambitious, supported with long erudite prefaces and footnotes. <span class="italic">Providence</span> (1764) is a blank verse theodicy, justifying God's plan in the natural order, the lateness of the Christian revelation, and the apparent injustices of human life. Later he turned to epic subjects and style with <span class="italic">Rona</span> (1777), a tragedy set on a Hebridean island, <span class="italic">The Fane of the Druids</span> (1787&#150;9), a partly mythical early history of Scotland, inspired by druid remains in his parish, and finally <span class="italic">Britannia, a National Epic Poem</span> (1801). This massive work, preceded by a dissertation justifying the use of epic machinery of angels and demons, described in over 15,000 lines of blank verse the legendary founding of Britain by a descendant of Aeneas of Troy. It had a distinguished list of subscribers, headed by the prince of Wales, but the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> feared that &#145;few persons will be able to accomplish a progress through the whole&#146;. In his eighth decade he was still energetically contributing to <span class="italic">The Poetical Register</span>, and published anonymously a poem, <span class="italic">Human Life</span> (1806): the sections on &#145;Infancy&#146; and &#145;Childhood&#146; are attractively and accurately observed. His last published poem was an elegy written in his seventy-ninth year.<br>
<br>Ogilvie wrote on the theory of aesthetics, most notably in <span class="italic">Philosophical Observations on the Nature, Character and Various Species of Composition</span> (1774), which has some originality in its exploration of the psychology of literary composition, and the interaction between the faculties of reason and imagination. He also published sermons, both in a collected volume (1766) and individually, and <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Causes of the Infidelity and Scepticism of the Times</span> (1783), exploring the social psychology of religious disbelief.<br>
<br>Ogilvie's works, whose sales were small, show great erudition in the ancient classics, but refer surprisingly little to his literary contemporaries. Although he was praised by John Langhorne, William Duff, and Thomas Blacklock, a fair contemporary judgement was that his undoubted talents had been spread on too many and too varied works to make any lasting impact. According to the entry in Joseph Robertson's <span class="italic">Lives of the Scottish Poets</span> (1822), Ogilvie was &#145;an able man, lost&#146;, whose &#145;intellectual wealth and industry were wasted in huge and unhappy speculations&#146;  (Robertson, 3.136). He was awarded a DD from Marischal College in 1766, was appointed to the committee for the revision of the translations and paraphrases used in the Church of Scotland in 1775, and in 1789 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died at Aberdeen on 17 November 1813.<br>
