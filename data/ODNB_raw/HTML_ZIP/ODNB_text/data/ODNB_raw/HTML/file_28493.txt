<span class="headword">Walker,  James Thomas</span>  (1826&#150;1896), <span class="occ">army officer and surveyor</span>, eldest son of John Walker of the Madras civil service, sometime judge at Cannanore, and his wife, Margaret Allan (<i>d</i>. 1830) of Edinburgh, was born at Cannanore, India, on 1 December 1826. He was educated by a private tutor in Wales, and at Addiscombe in 1843&#150;4, before being commissioned second lieutenant in the Bombay Engineers on 9 December 1844. After training at Chatham, he went to India, arriving at Bombay on 10 May 1846. The following year he went to Sind as executive engineer at Sukkur.<br>
<br>From 1848 to 1853 Walker served in a succession of frontier campaigns. He was several times mentioned in dispatches, but his active service was incidental to his surveying, which he vigorously prosecuted. It was dangerous work, and in the country between the Khyber and Kohat passes he was fired at on several occasions. He reconnoitred the approaches to the Ambela Pass, which ten years later was the scene of protracted fighting between British and local forces. On the completion of the military survey of the Peshawar frontier, he received the thanks of the government of India. He was promoted lieutenant on 2 July 1853, and, in recognition of his survey services on the frontier, was appointed on 1 December second assistant on the great trigonometrical survey of India under Sir Andrew Scott Waugh. He was promoted first assistant on 24 March 1854, and on 27 April married (in India) Alicia Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1896), daughter of General Sir John Scott KCB, and Alicia, granddaughter of Dr William Markham, archbishop of York. He worked first on the measurement of the Chach base, near Attock, and then had charge of the northern section of the Indus series of triangulation connecting the Chach and the Karachi bases. From 1852 to 1856 he taught at the newly opened Thomason Engineering College at Roorkee.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in 1857, Walker was once more involved in fighting. Acting with conspicuous courage at Delhi, he was severely wounded by a bullet in the left thigh, and shortly afterwards narrowly escaped death from cholera. He was promoted captain on 4 December 1857, and for his services in the mutiny received the medal, with clasp for Delhi, and the brevet rank of major on 19 January 1858. He returned to his survey duties and resumed work on the Indus series, which was completed in 1860; and he was afterwards employed in the Jogi Tila meridional series. In 1860 he served under Sir Neville Chamberlain in the expedition against the Mahsud Wazirs, for which he received the medal and clasp. Here again he made every effort to extend the survey, and sent a map which he had made of the country to the surveyor-general.<br>
<br>In September 1860 Walker was appointed astronomical assistant, and on 12 March 1861 superintendent, of the great trigonometrical survey of India. In the next two years the three last meridional series in the north of India were completed, and Walker's first independent work was the measurement of the Vizagapatam baseline, which was completed in 1862. The accuracy achieved was such that the difference between the measured length and the length computed from triangles, starting 480 miles away at the Calcutta baseline and passing through dense jungles, was only half an inch. By 1863 the main triangulation of India was brought back to its starting point at Madras, and Walker thus oversaw the completion of the work of Lambton, Everest, and Waugh. He next undertook a revision of Lambton's triangulation in the south of India, with remeasurements of the baselines.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1864 Walker was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and went home on furlough by way of Russia, establishing friendly relations with the geodesists of the Russian survey, which led to the exchange of geodetic and geographical information with St Petersburg. In 1864 he proposed a series of gravity pendulum observations, which were intended to contribute to the survey's aim of furnishing data for determining the figure of the earth. From 1865 to 1871 observations were made, but the method was subsequently proved unreliable.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1869 Walker was promoted brevet colonel, and about this time it was decided to publish an <span class="italic">Account of the Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India</span>, in twenty volumes. The first nine were published under Walker's supervision, beginning in 1871. The volumes describe the course and technical character of the survey and remain the standard authority on one of the most remarkable and extensive surveys ever undertaken. In 1871&#150;2, when in England on leave from India, Walker (with Sir Oliver Beauchamp Coventry St John) fixed the difference of longitude between Tehran and London. He remained in England to investigate the condition of the plates of the Indian atlas, and to write a memorandum on the projection and scale of the atlas. In 1873 he turned his attention to the dispersion of unavoidable minute errors in the triangulation, to ensure high standards of accuracy in the trigonometrical survey.<br>
<br>Walker's work as superintendent of the great trigonometrical survey was as much that of a geographer as of a geodesist. At his office at Dehra Dun explorers were trained, survey parties for military expeditions organized, and Indian surveyors dispatched to make discoveries, while their observations were reduced and combined. Many valuable maps were published, and Walker's map of Turkestan, compiled using information from his Russian colleagues, went through many editions. He also initiated a scheme of tidal observations at different ports on the Indian coast and devised the method of analysing the observations. Beginning in 1858 he arranged an extensive scheme of spirit-levelling, connecting the tidal observation stations by lines of levels (sometimes extending across the continent), in order to fix the exact heights above sea level of the survey baselines. The network proved of great value to canal and railway engineers who used it to provide datum points for their surveys.<br>
<br>On 2 June 1877 Walker was made a companion of the Bath, military division. He was appointed surveyor-general of India on 1 January 1878, retaining the office of superintendent of the trigonometrical survey. On 31 December of the same year he was promoted major-general, and on 10 May 1881 lieutenant-general. He retired on 12 February 1883, and received the honorary rank of general on 12 January 1884, but his services in India received no official recognition.<br>
<br>Walker, like his cousin Clements Markham (with whom he had corresponded professionally while the latter was geographer at the India Office), was keenly interested in geography. He was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1859, and from 1885 to 1896 served on its council. In 1885 he was president of the geographical section of the British Association at Aberdeen. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1865, was made a member of the Russian geographical society in 1868, and of the French in 1887. In June 1883 he was made an honorary LLD of Cambridge University. In 1895 he took charge of the geodetic work of the international geographical congress at the Imperial Institute in London. He contributed to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>, the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, and the Royal Geographical Society's <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Walker died at his home, 13 Cromwell Road, London, on 16 February 1896, and was buried on 20 February in Brompton cemetery. His wife, a son, Herbert John (lieutenant in the Royal Engineers), and three daughters survived him.<br>
