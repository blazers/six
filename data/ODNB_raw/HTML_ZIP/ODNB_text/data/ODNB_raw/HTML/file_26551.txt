<span class="headword">Stoddart, Sir  John</span>  (1773&#150;1856), <span class="occ">writer and lawyer</span>, born at Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 6 February 1773, was the eldest child of John Stoddart (1742&#150;1803), lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (<i>d</i>. 1811), who were married in the following year. His father's naval career was largely spent on the half-pay list, with stints commanding a press gang in Southampton and Poole; his mother became insane. Stoddart was educated at Salisbury grammar school, and matriculated on 25 October 1790 from Christ Church, Oxford, where he was elected a student in 1791, and graduated BA in 1794. At Oxford he found a patron in Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, to whose nephew he was tutor at Eton in 1795. In the following year, having come under the influence of William Godwin's writings, he took a radical turn and lost Barrington's favour. Described by Charles Lamb as &#145;a cold hearted, well bred, conceited disciple of Godwin&#146;  (D. Wu, <span class="italic">William Hazlitt</span>, 2008, 72), he embraced republicanism and revolutionary France, looked forward to a Napoleonic military victory, and adopted the cropped hairstyle of the sans-culottes. He read for the bar at Gray's Inn, and lodged with Basil Montagu, at whose chambers he became an associate of radicals and literary figures including William Hazlitt and Wordsworth. He took to writing as a source of income, translating from the French of Joseph Despaze <span class="italic">The five men, or, A review of the proceedings and principles of the executive directory of France, with the lives of the present members</span> (1797), and from the German, with Georg Heinrich Noehden, two of Schiller's plays, <span class="italic">Fiesco</span> (1796) and <span class="italic">Don Carlos</span> (1798).<br>
<br>By the end of the century Stoddart's republican enthusiasm had waned, and he mixed with nobility on his tour of Scotland, which was the basis for his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Local Scenery and Manners of Scotland</span> (1801). In the autumn of 1800, on his return from Scotland, he stayed in the Lake District with Coleridge and Wordsworth, who drew upon passages from Stoddart's book in <span class="italic">The Prelude</span>. Stoddart reviewed <span class="italic">Lyrical Ballads</span> in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> in 1801. Having undergone the formality of taking the Oxford law degrees of BCL (1798) and DCL (1801) he was admitted a member of the College of Advocates at Doctors' Commons in November 1802. Shortly after, he was reconciled with the bishop of Durham, and on 1 August 1803 married Isabella, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18945/', "Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, eighth baronet")</script>, a Church of Scotland minister. In 1803 he was appointed the king's and the Admiralty advocate in Malta, where he remained until 1807, accompanied by his sister Sarah Stoddart (1774&#150;1840).<br>
<br>Following their return to Britain, Stoddart's sister married William Hazlitt in May 1808. Concerned about Hazlitt's uncertain finances, Stoddart did not favour the union, and drew up the marriage settlement in terms that limited the annual amount his brother-in-law could draw upon from Sarah's own property. His relationship with Hazlitt, already uneasy, worsened after he became a leader writer on <span class="italic">The Times</span> in October 1812, having made occasional contributions since 1810, including a series of letters on American affairs published in December 1811. Following the death of the proprietor, John Walter the first, his influence on the paper grew and the tone of his articles became increasingly violent. In January 1814 he wrote an angry denunciation of Hazlitt's articles in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> sympathetic to Napoleon, whom Stoddart denounced as a tyrant. Hazlitt retaliated with a personal attack on his brother-in-law, whom he regarded as a renegade from republicanism. The exchanges became sharper as Stoddart rejected the possibility of peace with Napoleon, and embraced the cause of French ultra-royalists. Crabb Robinson complained of &#145;the Doctor's outrageous Bourbon zeal&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 159), and Stoddart's extreme French policy alarmed the paper's proprietor, John Walter the second, who brought in Thomas Barnes to tone down Stoddart's articles, but Stoddart resisted curbs on his independence. Hazlitt launched a further sustained attack on Stoddart's writings in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in December 1816, and at the end of that month Stoddart was dismissed. He launched a periodical, <span class="italic">The Correspondent</span>, to counter subversion on both sides of the English channel, with Chateaubriand as a contributor, which lasted for three issues in 1817.<br>
<br>In February 1817 Stoddart started a rival to <span class="italic">The Times</span> entitled the <span class="italic">New Times</span>, which was soon amalgamated with <span class="italic">The Day</span>. For a short time it appeared as the <span class="italic">Day and New Times</span>, but dropped the first half of the title in 1818. It was funded by the government and by French ultras. It survived as the <span class="italic">New Times</span> until about 1828. During the period of his editorship Stoddart was scurrilously known as Dr Slop, and was the subject of several satires, of which <span class="italic">A Slap at Slop</span> (1820), by William Hone, ran through four editions.<br>
<br>Stoddart's connection with the <span class="italic">New Times</span> probably ceased in 1826, when he was appointed chief justice and justice of the vice-admiralty court in Malta, and on 27 July was knighted by George IV at St James's Palace. Finding that the Maltese complained that former judges were imperfectly acquainted with their language, he made himself master of Italian. He gave full satisfaction in his office, and the islanders had perfect confidence in his decisions. He published in 1830&#150;32 (3 pts) <span class="italic">Trial by jury: a speech on the opening of a commission in Malta for establishing a modified trial by jury, translated from the Italian</span>. During an outbreak of cholera in the island he devoted himself to its elimination with great success.<br>
<br>Returning to England in 1840, Stoddart formulated an etymological theory, which he believed would supplant that of Horne Tooke, and presented it in a work called <span class="italic">Glossology, or, The Historical Relations of Languages</span>. He completed only the first part of this work, which was published in 1858 in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>. Stoddart also contributed an entry, &#145;Grammar&#146;, and the introductory chapter, &#145;The uses of history as a study&#146;, to the quarto edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>, and wrote an introduction to the &#145;Study of universal history&#146; for the 1850 octavo edition.<br>
<br>Of Stoddart's writings on legal subjects, the most important was <span class="italic">A Letter to Lord Brougham</span>, one in the minority of the law lords by whom the great Irish marriage case, <i>R. v. Millis</i>, was decided in 1844, and, as Stoddart endeavoured to show, erroneously decided. On this case he also published in 1844 a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Irish marriage question: observations on the opinions delivered by Lord Cottenham in the Irish marriage case</span>. His legal acumen was also shown in his article &#145;The head of the church&#146; in the <span class="italic">Law Review</span> (February 1851).<br>
<br>Stoddart died at his residence, 13 Brompton Square, London, on 16 February 1856. His wife had predeceased him on 2 February 1846. Of his numerous offspring, two of his sons predeceased him: Henry Moncrieff died while a pupil at Charterhouse School, and John Frederick, a member of the Scottish bar in 1827 and a judge in Ceylon in 1836, died of a jungle fever while on circuit on 29 August 1839. A third son, William Wellwood, vicar of Charlbury, Oxfordshire, died at Genoa on 21 November 1856.<br>
