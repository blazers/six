<span class="headword">Preston,  Richard</span>  (1768&#150;1850), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Ashburton in Devon, the only son of John Preston, minister, of Okehampton, also in Devon. He began his career as an attorney, but attracted the notice of Sir Francis Buller by his first work, <span class="italic">An Elementary Treatise on the Quantity of Estates</span> (1791). On Buller's advice he entered the Inner Temple, in 1793, where, after practising for some years as a certificated conveyancer, he was called to the bar on 20 May 1807, was elected a bencher in 1834, in which year he took silk, and was reader in 1844.<br>
<br>Preston was MP for Ashburton in the parliament of 1812&#150;18, and was one of the earliest and most robust advocates of the imposition of the corn duties. In 1815 he published an <span class="italic">Address to the fundholder, the manufacturer, the mechanic, and the poor on the subject of the corn laws</span>. Other tracts on the same subject appeared in <span class="italic">The Pamphleteer</span> between 1816 and 1818. In 1816 he made vigorous attacks in parliament on the government's financial mismanagement. But in the two following sessions his speeches became infrequent. He had invested a large fortune, derived from his conveyancing practice, in land in Devon. In law, as in politics, he was intensely conservative, and thought the <span class="roman">Fines and Recoveries Act</span> a dangerous innovation; but his knowledge of the technique of real-property law was considerable and his works on conveyancing were lucid and well researched. He wrote several legal treatises, including <span class="italic">A Treatise on Conveyancing</span> (1806&#150;9) which ran into a third edition. He was for some time professor of law at King's College, London. He died on 20 June 1850 at his seat, Lee House, Chulmleigh, in north Devon.<br>
