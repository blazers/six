<span class="headword">Baring,  (George) Rowland Stanley</span>, third earl of Cromer  (1918&#150;1991), <span class="occ">banker and diplomatist</span>, was born on 28 July 1918, the only son and youngest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30585/', "Rowland Thomas Baring, second earl of Cromer (1877&#150;1953)")</script>, courtier, and his wife, Lady Ruby Florence Mary (1886&#150;1961), second daughter of Gilbert John Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, fourth earl of Minto, viceroy of India. He was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Errington (his grandfather the first earl having died the year before his birth) until succeeding as third earl in 1953. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he left after a year. His father was lord chamberlain (1922&#150;38) and all his life he moved in court circles; he acted as page of honour to George V (who was his godfather) from 1931 to 1935, and to Queen Mary at the coronation in 1937. On 10 January 1942 he married the Hon. Esm&eacute; Mary Gabriel Harmsworth (<i>b</i>. 1922), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31202/', "Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, second Viscount Rothermere")</script>. They had a daughter, Lana Mary Gabriel (<i>b</i>. 1943), and two sons, Evelyn Rowland Esmond (<i>b</i>. 1946) and Vivian John Rowland (<i>b</i>. 1950). Lady Cromer was later a lady-in-waiting and from 1967 lady of the bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II.<br>
<br>After Cambridge, Errington acted as private secretary to the marquess of Willingdon, former proconsul, during his official goodwill visit to South America in 1938, and then, in October 1938, joined his family's merchant bank of Baring Brothers as a clerk. His career was cut short by the outbreak of war. He joined the Grenadier Guards in 1939 and (after accompanying the marquess of Willingdon to New Zealand in 1940) saw active service in north-west Europe. He was appointed MBE in 1945, and demobilized as a lieutenant-colonel in 1946.<br>
<br>Errington rejoined Barings in 1946 and for a year he worked in New York with Kidder Peabody and J. P. Morgan, among others. On his return in 1948 he was appointed a partner. He joined a partnership with several long-serving members, and for many years played a comparatively junior role in the firm's affairs. Nevertheless he took up directorships of public companies such as Royal Insurance and Daily Mail and General Trust, the latter being the family business of his father-in-law, Lord Rothermere. On succeeding as earl of Cromer, he found diversion in the House of Lords. He spoke on subjects ranging from the technical (no par value shares) to the general (the Suez crisis, when dressed in the full uniform of a lieutenant-colonel of the Grenadier Guards). In 1954 he joined a parliamentary delegation to Brazil. The connections he developed doubtless assisted his appointment (at the request of Sir Roger Makins, the British ambassador) in 1959 as economic minister and head of treasury and supply delegation at the British embassy in Washington, which he combined with the UK executive directorships of, among others, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.<br>
<br>In 1961 Harold Macmillan, who found Cromer &#145;very intelligent. He agrees with me&#146;  (H. Macmillan, <span class="italic">At the End of the Day</span>, 1973, 381), appointed him governor of the Bank of England, although Cromer was not Macmillan's first choice, Sir Oliver Franks having already declined the post. At forty-two, Cromer was the youngest governor since the eighteenth century. While a traditionalist, he was also a modernizer at a time when modernization was much needed by the City and the bank. He breathed new life into the bank, then at a low ebb following the Parker tribunal and the findings of the Radcliffe committee, by recruiting a generation of young and able managers. More generally, he helped to steer the City towards a dominating role in the emerging and immensely important Euro markets. A staunch defender of financial good order, his relationship with both Conservative and Labour governments was frequently difficult, as he pressed courageously for policies of economic probity to ensure low inflation and a sound currency. Macmillan and his chancellor, Selwyn Lloyd, came to find Cromer's warnings an irritant. Cromer's relations with prime minister Harold Wilson were more difficult still; they encountered bruising confrontation.<br>
<br>The Labour government elected in October 1964 aimed to carry through an ambitious programme of social welfare, but its inability to adapt this to the reality of what could be afforded led to a run on sterling in November. A 2 per cent rise in the interest rate failed to re-establish confidence, and the reserves were draining away. At the height of the crisis, Cromer demanded expenditure controls and the abandonment of Labour policies in order to restore confidence in sterling and head off a major international financial crisis. A defiant Wilson told him that the solution lay in the hands of the world's central banks and sent him off to raise from them $3 billion in credits. Cromer achieved this in a few hours of hectic telephoning, although he had anticipated the need and had already prepared his ground. Confidence was restored for the time being, which the next day enabled Wilson to rebut tory overtures for a national coalition government. While this credit-raising exercise won Cromer Wilson's admiration, in 1965 their relations grew worse as a succession of economic crises followed. Wilson's response to Cromer's continued pleas for moderation in expenditure was influenced by his belief that the governor was motivated in part by political considerations. On the eve of the 1966 general election, when Wilson sought to strengthen his precarious majority, he rejected an unpopular interest-rate rise proposed by Cromer to head off another crisis. Cromer warned him that the bank had a statutory right to act independently and, if overruled, it would say so publicly. &#145;In that case&#146;, the prime minister said, &#145;the history of the Bank of England, which had begun with Governor Houblon, would end with Governor Cromer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Jan 1997). It was hardly surprising that later in 1966 neither Cromer nor the chancellor wished for the governor's tenure of office to be renewed for a further five years. Cromer had continuously undermined his cause by public utterances and by an ability to antagonize the politicians; this underlined his attachment to a passing world of less politicized relationships. Labour leaders were later to establish easier relations with Cromer's successors, Leslie O'Brien and Gordon Richardson, and said so publicly.<br>
<br>In 1966 Cromer returned to Barings, where he was now senior partner both in terms of years of service and in his partnership share. But, devoted as he was to his family's bank, the somewhat humdrum existence it now offered him was an anticlimax, and at times he was out of step with its understated style. Outside Barings he sat as chairman of a committee of inquiry into the working of Lloyd's of London; had its report, which went unpublished for seventeen years, been acted on more fully, many of the market's later excesses might have been avoided. He became chairman of IBM (UK) Ltd and a director of Union Carbide Corporation of the USA, and joined a Board of Trade inquiry into export business generated by capital projects overseas. His implied criticism of Wilson's government continued. His public utterances&#151;not least on the authoritative television programme <span class="italic">Panorama</span> on the eve of the June 1970 election, when he referred to the existence of &#145;a very much more difficult financial situation than the new government found in 1964&#146;&#151;were seized upon by the tories. It is reckoned these comments were a significant factor in tipping the scales in their favour.<br>
<br>Edward Heath, who knew Cromer well, rewarded him with the appointment from January 1971 as ambassador in Washington. Relations between the Heath government and President Nixon and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, were not close, but it is considered that Cromer did well in difficult circumstances. These were the years of British entry into the Common Market, and here Cromer's financial background well qualified him to explain Britain's position to the Americans. It was also the time of the Yom Kippur War, for which British support was tepid, and, not least, of Watergate.<br>
<br>On his return to London in March 1974 Cromer was still a comparatively young man, and he considered resuming his position at Barings; however, another generation of partners was now firmly in place and had embarked upon a process of overdue modernization. Instead Cromer became special adviser to the firm and resumed or took up afresh directorships of leading companies, including Shell Transport and Trading Company Ltd, IBM (UK) Ltd, P. &amp; O. Steam Navigation Company, Imperial Group, and Compagnie Financi&egrave;re de Suez. He was made a privy councillor in 1966 and received numerous honours including appointment as GCMG in 1974 and KG in 1977. In 1980 he retired to Jersey but he returned to live in London in 1990. He died in London on 16 March 1991. He was survived by his wife and two sons (the elder of whom succeeded him as fourth earl of Cromer), his daughter having predeceased him in 1974. A memorial service was held at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, on 16 May 1991.<br>
