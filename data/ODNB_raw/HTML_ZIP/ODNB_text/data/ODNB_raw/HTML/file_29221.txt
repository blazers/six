<span class="headword">Whitaker,  Jeremiah</span>  (1599&#150;1654), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Wakefield, Yorkshire; nothing is known about his parents. He was educated at Wakefield grammar school and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1619 and proceeded MA in 1623. He was ordained priest at Peterborough on 25 March 1623.<br>
<br>Whitaker's friend and godly hagiographer, Simeon Ashe, claimed his favourite saying was &#145;I had rather be a Preacher of the Gospel than an Emperor&#146;  (Ashe, 53), and this evangelical mission does seem to have been the main impetus of Whitaker's life. After university he was appointed master of Oakham School, Rutland, founded by the puritan Robert Johnson, who in 1625 promoted him to governor. His energetic extra-curricular activity included reading a weekly lecture in the town and preaching in neighbouring parishes and he quickly established influential puritan contacts. In 1620 he married Chephtzibah, daughter of William Peachy, the puritan incumbent at Oakham; they had two sons, Jeremiah and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29229/', "William Whitaker (d. 1672)")</script>, both eventually clergymen. More exalted socially were the Cecil family of Burghley, earls of Exeter, Whitaker's lifelong patrons. He witnessed the will of David, the third earl, and his own funeral sermon was to be dedicated to David's widow. On 17 April 1627 the puritans Sir John Pickering and Robert Horsman appointed Whitaker the rector of nearby Stretton. He continued to read the Oakham lecture, preached at Stretton &#145;twice every Sabbath&#146;, was a &#145;principal prop to hold up Lectures in the neighbourhood&#146;, and attended private godly prayer meetings  (Ashe, 56). He even preached at the archdeacon of Northampton's visitation at Uppingham in 1628, but fell foul of the church courts in the same year for conspiring with a parishioner to omit the sign of the cross in baptism.<br>
<br>Ashe claimed that Whitaker played a prominent role in resisting royal policy in the 1630s by refusing to read the anti-sabbatarian <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> (1633), conscientiously objecting to paying the clerical contribution to fund the bishops' wars (1639), and preaching on Sundays not only in the morning but also in the afternoon, which the Caroline church discouraged. Extant church court records contain no account of this intransigence: Ashe conceded that a sympathetic neighbour paid the contribution for Whitaker against his wishes. In August 1640, however, Whitaker was indeed one of the leaders of a conference of puritan ministers meeting at Kettering, which declared the &#145;etcetera oath&#146; (legitimizing the new Laudian canons) illegal and endorsed the invasion of the Scottish army as a means of attaining a common redress of grievances.<br>
<br>The Long Parliament was regarded as an instrument of godly reformation, and in 1641 Whitaker subscribed to a petition calling for a missionary effort to convert Native Americans. However, the embryonic process of reform was jeopardized by the outbreak of civil war, as Whitaker made clear in a sermon (later printed as <span class="italic">Eirenopoios</span>) delivered at the parliamentary fast on 25 January 1643 prior to the abortive Oxford negotiations with Charles I. He called for unity among those desiring reformation and reinforced this by signing a plea for an end to the foundation of separatist churches, <span class="italic">Certaine Considerations</span> (1643). The same year he was chosen as a member of the Westminster assembly of divines, convened to produce a new religious settlement, and served on one of the crucial standing committees. Now a high-profile presbyterian, he made influential contributions on several subjects, most notably condemning ordination by parish congregations. He preached at a further eight parliamentary fasts (1646&#150;8) but the only other sermons to be published were <span class="italic">The Christian's Hope Triumphing</span>, preached on 28 May 1645, and <span class="italic">The Danger of Greatnesse</span>, delivered on 14 January 1646. In the latter he attributed the violent deaths of successive kings of Judah to their preference for arbitrary government. He replaced London ministers ejected by parliament during the civil wars at St Stephen, Coleman Street (May to July 1645), and St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey Street (1644&#150;54). He participated in the presbyterian classis founded by London ministers, and refused to swear allegiance to the republic after Charles I's execution, although he seems to have been on good terms with the subsequent regime of Lord Protector Cromwell, to whom he wrote with the gift of a book.<br>
<br>Whitaker died at Bermondsey on 1 June 1654 and was buried on 6 June in the chancel of the church. Ashe's funeral oration was the basis of the biography in Samuel Clarke's <span class="italic">Lives</span>. At a memorial service tributes were delivered by Matthew Newcomen, among others. Ashe said Christ's own comment would have been: &#145;Our friend Whitaker sleepeth&#146;  (Ashe, 68).<br>
