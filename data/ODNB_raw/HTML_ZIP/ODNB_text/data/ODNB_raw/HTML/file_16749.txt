<span class="headword">Linwood,  William</span>  (1817&#150;1878), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in Birmingham, and baptized there on 29 December 1818, the only son of William Linwood (1780/81&#150;1853), merchant, and his wife, Mary Iliffe (1795&#150;1869). He was a nephew of the needlework artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16748/', "Mary Linwood")</script>. Educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, during the headmasterships of John Cooke and Francis Jeune, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1834, but matriculated at Oxford in December 1835 as a member of Christ Church, where he was nominated by Thomas Gaisford to a studentship in 1837. His university career was remarkable. In 1836 he gained the Hertford, Ireland, and Craven scholarships, and in 1839 obtained the Boden Sanskrit scholarship. Graduating BA in 1839 with first-class honours in classics, he proceeded MA in 1842. He was briefly a master at Shrewsbury School in 1841, and he also took private pupils at Oxford on the strength of his achievements as an undergraduate, but he never held an official tutorial position in the university. Two contemporaries, William Gregory and William Tuckwell, left unfavourable accounts of his shabby appearance and uncouth manner, which perhaps explain his failure to gain further advancement as a teacher. He did, however, serve as an examiner in classics at Oxford during 1850&#150;51, startling his fellow examiners by proposing that in deciding the candidates' merits they should &#145;throw into the fire all that other rubbish, and go by the Greek Prose&#146;  (Tuckwell, 150).<br>
<br>Sermons delivered by Linwood as assistant curate at St Chad's, Shrewsbury, on the Catholic church (1841) and baptismal regeneration (1842) indicated a sympathy with the Tractarian movement. He took deacon's orders in 1843 but never proceeded to the priesthood, and on his failure to do so was obliged to relinquish his studentship at Christ Church in June 1851. He appears thereafter to have lived on private means.<br>
<br>Linwood was described as using ancient Greek like a vernacular tongue, and as showing an extraordinary readiness at Greek versification. His scholarship was hardly reflected in his publications, which were more or less intended for elementary students. His <span class="italic">Lexicon to Aeschylus</span> (1843) was regarded as clearly arranged and serviceable. Although his edition of Sophocles (1846; 4th edn, 1877) was widely used in schools, two later editors, F. H. M. Blaydes and F. A. Paley, had occasion to comment on his notes as being hurriedly compiled. He became best known as editor and contributor to <span class="italic">Anthologia Oxoniensis</span> (1845), a collection of verse in Greek, Latin, and English which became a model for subsequent compilations. Latterly, he turned his attention to conjectural emendation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. He married, on 12 August 1857, Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1863), daughter of William Andrews, solicitor. They had a son, born in 1861. A widower, on 2 July 1870 he married Emma, daughter of Benjamin Tonks, wholesale jeweller. Linwood, whose achievements never lived up to his promise as a student, died at his home, Birchfield, Handsworth, Staffordshire, on 7 September 1878. He is to be distinguished from William Linwood, the former Unitarian minister from Brixton, who, in 1850, edited the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>  (<span class="italic">Victorian Periodicals Review</span>, 27, 1994, 183).<br>
