<span class="headword">Heard,  Henry Fitzgerald <span class="st"> [Gerald]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1971), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 6 October 1889 at 69 Victoria Park Road, South Hackney, London, the second of three sons of the Revd Henry James Heard (<i>d</i>. 1931) and his wife, Maud Jervis Bannatyne (<i>d</i>. 1892). His paternal grandfather, the Revd John Bickford Heard (1828&#150;1908), gave the Hulsean lectures in 1892. At the time of his birth Heard's father was the incumbent of Christ Church, South Hackney. After the death of his mother Heard was looked after by a grandmother who belonged to the Plymouth Brethren.<br>
<br>Heard, who was known as Gerald, was educated first at Hamilton House and Lansdowne Proprietary in Bath, and then at Sherborne School, Dorset, between May 1904 and July 1907. At that time the school was headed by the son of the bishop of Durham, Frederick Brooke Westcott, who excelled in the teaching of divinity and exercised a charismatic influence over his students. Like his father and grandfather, Heard went on to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1908 and received his BA in the history tripos (second class) in 1911. Intending to take holy orders as his father and grandfather had done, he became a theological exhibitioner at Caius in 1911. However, he did not take holy orders in the end, although his subsequent career as a peripatetic mystical preacher may be viewed as the fulfilment of his spiritual vocation. He rejected doctrinal Christianity due to the influences of his Cambridge years, when he was exposed to psychical research, anthropology, and the humanist philosophies of Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson and J. McT. E. McTaggart.<br>
<br>Heard was employed as a private secretary to Lord Robson (1852&#150;1918) between 1913 and 1914. He did not serve in the First World War, having been rejected by the military on physical grounds, and about 1916 he probably suffered a nervous breakdown over his crisis of faith. From 1919 to 1923 he was employed as a live-in secretary to the agricultural expert and retired Irish statesman Sir Horace Plunkett in Foxrock, Ireland. The precise nature of the relationship is unclear. While working for Plunkett, Heard became interested in utopian living and began his career as a writer, although his publications were mostly sporadic until the late 1920s. He wrote for the revived <span class="italic">Irish Statesman</span> under the editorship of George Russell (A. E.), and worked on his first two books, <span class="italic">Narcissus: an Anatomy of Clothes</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">The Ascent of Humanity</span> (1929). In 1923 republican forces tried to burn down Plunkett's house with Heard in it. Their relationship was already floundering at this point, so, although both men moved to England and Heard continued with Plunkett in a secretarial capacity until the statesman's death in 1932, Heard moved in with Christopher (Chris) Wood (<i>d</i>. 1976), heir to a jam fortune. Heard was a trustee of the Plunkett Foundation for Agricultural Cooperation from 1924 until 1948, and was both the executor and main beneficiary of Plunkett's will.<br>
<br>From the late 1920s until his emigration to America in 1937 Gerald Heard was an influential figure in intellectual circles in London. Described as &#145;one of the most penetrating minds in England&#146; by E. M. Forster  (Nicolson, 87), &#145;the cleverest man in the world&#146; by Evelyn Waugh  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 321), and &#145;our prophet&#146; by Naomi Mitchison  (Mitchison, 107), he made, as Aldous Huxley put it, &#145;his mental home on the vacant spaces between the pigeonholes&#146;. A self-proclaimed &#145;scientific humanist&#146;, Heard sought to reconcile science and religion within a &#145;third morality&#146;&#151;the title of his 1937 work. Heard's &#145;third morality&#146; reflected many of the intellectual currents of his day, including idealist philosophy, pacifism, modernist theology, eastern religious philosophy, and psychical research. Heard's writings and influence are significant for their suggestion that philosophical idealism &#145;relocated&#146; to popular intellectual arenas; that there was a continuing interest in spiritual matters; and that eastern religious ideas offered new ways to approach the spiritual dilemmas previously addressed by psychical research.<br>
<br>Heard expounded his &#145;third morality&#146; in several books on the &#145;historical anthropology of consciousness&#146;  (Dunaway, 23). These included a trilogy&#151;<span class="italic">The Ascent of Humanity</span> (1929), <span class="italic">The Social Substance of Religion</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">The Source of Civilization</span> (1935)&#151;and <span class="italic">The Emergence of Man</span> (1931), a reworking of Winwood Reade's <span class="italic">The Martyrdom of Man</span> (1872). He also proselytized his theories in popular science broadcasts for the BBC, and in articles and reviews which appeared in a range of mostly left-leaning periodicals, particularly the feminist <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>. He founded his own magazine, <span class="italic">The Realist&#151;A Journal of Scientific Humanism</span>, in 1929; it was well received but short-lived. Heard's popular idealism appealed especially to women, both in 1930s Britain and in post-war America, although his work was read by most prominent London intellectuals between the wars.<br>
<br>Like another charismatic religious leader of the 1930s, the Oxford Group movement leader Frank Buchman, Heard sought to promote his views within spiritual groups. These groups were active at Maude Royden's inter-denominational Guildhouse Church, the South Place Ethical Society, and at Dartington Hall, the co-operative educational community founded by Dorothy and Leonard Elmhirst in Devon. These groups are significant both as early examples of group therapy and for reflecting the larger intersection between Pauline theology and psychology in this period. Less successfully, Heard sought to form spiritual groups within H. R. L. Sheppard's Peace Pledge Union, of which he was a leading member and to which he recruited Aldous Huxley. Heard was also involved with the Howard League for Penal Reform, the Society for Psychical Research, the Federation of Progressive Societies and Individuals, and the Cranium Club.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with the future of pacifism and convinced of Europe's imminent destruction, in 1937 Heard emigrated to California with his partner, Chris Wood, along with his friend Aldous Huxley and his family. In the summer of 1937 Heard and Huxley visited Georgia O'Keefe at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, and O'Keefe painted a symbolic portrait of Heard as a tree (<span class="italic">Gerald's Tree I</span>, 1937, Georgia O'Keefe Museum, Santa Fe, New Mexico; Mitchell, 3&#150;7). Heard expounded his pacifist &#145;third morality&#146; throughout the war, founding an eastern-influenced mystical community for the training of pacifists&#151;Trabuco College&#151;near Laguna Beach, California, in 1941. The community was visited by Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley, Ezra Pound, and others, and was taken over by the Vedanta Society in 1949.<br>
<br>Heard continued to promote his spiritual ideas after the war through further books and lectures. The latter were given at the Coronet Theatre in Hollywood (1955&#150;7 and 1959&#150;61), the Harvard Divinity School (1961), and the New School for Social Research (1953), as well as on television and radio. He wrote numerous books on spirituality as well as several acclaimed works of science and detective fiction: these included <span class="italic">Doppelgangers</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">A Taste for Honey</span> (1941). The latter became a film, <span class="italic">The Deadly Bees</span> (1967). He also supplied several celebrities&#151;Dave Brubeck, Clare Boothe Luce, and others&#151;with spiritual counselling, and introduced some to LSD before Timothy Leary. For a time he was seriously preoccupied with flying saucers.<br>
<br>Heard's relationship with Chris Wood ended about 1953, and he lived out the latter years of his life with Jay Michael Barrie (1912&#150;2001), a former singer who lived at Trabuco as a monk until about 1955. Barrie worked for Heard in a secretarial and managerial capacity from the 1950s onwards, and nursed him through a five-year illness and two strokes until his death in 1971.<br>
<br>Slight in stature with striking pale blue eyes, Heard had great presence. This stemmed partly from his reputation as a brilliant &#145;Wellsian supermind&#146; who read 2000 books a year  (Furbank, 136), and partly from his personal charisma and melodious voice. Along with Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood, Heard has been credited with contributing to the spread both of mystical religious ideas and a &#145;counter-cultural tradition&#146; in America  (Robb, 46). By the time of his death in Santa Monica on 14 August 1971, Heard had become a public intellectual in California.<br>
