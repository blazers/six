<span class="headword">Fayreford,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1400&#150;1450), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, is responsible for the only extant medieval list of cures performed on patients. Fayreford owned, and partly wrote, BL, Harley MS 2558, which is the only source for his life and work. There was a Thomas Fayreford, a Dominican named in a royal mandate as having rebelled in reaction to a direction given by the prior provincial after a visitation in Oxford in 1370, and it is known that the Thomas Fayreford who wrote the list of cures was in Oxford in the first decade of the fifteenth century. But the time gap is large, and there is no sign of the interests of a past or present Dominican in the manuscript. Harley MS 2558 does, however, provide a series of tantalizing glimpses of the working life of a fifteenth-century medical practitioner.<br>
<br>The parts of the manuscript written by Fayreford include the list of cures  (BL, Harley MS 2558, fol. 9), and two long texts on medicine and surgery compiled by the writer, almost all in Latin. The list of cures, occupying two sides of paper, gives details of patients' names, sometimes their occupations and places of residence, the ailments from which they suffered, and occasionally the prognosis&#151;&#145;quod omnes disperaverunt de vita eius&#146; (&#145;that all despaired of his life&#146;)&#151;and treatment. It is titled &#145;the list of cures performed by Thomas Fayreford in different places&#146;, and the list contains 103 entries, though some entries refer to more than one patient. Unfortunately there are no dates for the cures, though many of the places named can be identified. As one of the patients comes from Fairford in Gloucestershire, it seems likely that this was the place of origin of Thomas Fayreford. Since he mentions seeing a cure performed by Nicholas Colnet in Oxford, almost certainly in the first decade of the fifteenth century, Fayreford may have had some training and access to medical books there. Fayreford's own hand suggests a date of writing in the second quarter of the century.<br>
<br>Bridgwater in Somerset was one centre of Fayreford's medical activity, Tiverton in Devon another, but there is also a group of cases lying in the far north-west of Devon, from Linton to Barnstaple. It is unlikely either that patients from these places travelled long distances to see Fayreford, or that he travelled to them from one home base. It is more likely that he was situated in these areas at different phases of his career, and that the entire list represents his later recollection of all the phases of his medical activity. His patients came from diverse social backgrounds, from Lady Poynings to &#145;cook Geffrey&#146;, and included clergy, a miller, and a cellarer. He treated men, women, and children&#151;63 definitely male, and 42 female, and among both sexes, 17 children. The most prominent, and surprising, ailment he treated was suffocation of the womb, diagnosed in many of his female patients from Lady Poynings down. Fayreford's expertise in gynaecological matters belies the idea that male medieval doctors did not meddle in female complaints. Otherwise the complaints range from straightforward surgical problems like burns, thorns, or fractures, to categories of fever that were the domain of the physician rather than the surgeon.<br>
<br>Fayreford's remedies were drawn from unimpeachable academic sources in some cases; in others they were validated by experience, Fayreford's own or that of others. This is revealed by a study of the medical and surgical texts that he compiled. These are in effect commonplace books, gathering under the headings of particular diseases various remedies, written into the book by Fayreford at different times. Many of these remedies are quoted from academic sources like Bernard de Gordon or Gilbert the Englishman. Lady Poynings gave him a remedy for <i>demigreyne</i>, and Fayreford testified to his own success with certain &#145;experiments&#146;. Like other respectable medical practitioners Fayreford also used charms, making little distinction between a charm for epilepsy and a &#145;rational&#146; remedy for the same complaint.<br>
<br>It is not known when Fayreford's active medical practice ended. The writing of his book may have been intended to pass on his secrets to his heir or apprentice. But the book gives a unique insight into the character of late medieval medical practice.<br>
