<span class="headword">Browne,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1480&#150;<em>c.</em>1505), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was in 1490 one of the chaplains of the household chapel of John de Vere, earl of Oxford; the identification is confirmed by a contemporary musical source in which the composer is named as &#145;Johannes Browne Oxoniensis&#146;. No further information survives of the circumstances of his life, but that he was known also to royalty is suggested by the fact that his six-voice setting of <span class="italic">Stabat iuxta Christi crucem</span> was apparently written for Elizabeth of York following the untimely death of her son Prince Arthur in 1502. Musicians of this period in aristocratic employment commonly composed songs and devotional pieces to vernacular texts, as well as church music; three compositions surviving in a songbook of 1501 attributed just to Browne, two to devotional texts and one to secular, may well be the work of this John Browne.<br>
<br>In the quality of his accomplishment Browne may be considered the greatest English composer of the period between John Dunstaple, who died in 1453, and John Taverner, who died in 1545. In the compilation (<i>c</i>.1502&#150;5) of the Eton choirbook of sacred music his work was accorded pride of place [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. His fifteen compositions originally included there comprised eleven Marian antiphons and four settings of the Magnificat. Of these, nine survive in a state either complete or completable; most noteworthy among them are the eight-voice <span class="italic">O Maria salvatoris mater</span> and the three six-voice settings of texts derived from the sequence <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span>. Browne's polyphony is dense and endlessly resourceful. He is a master of cogency of overall planning, deploying <i>cantus firmus</i> technique and the alternation of reduced-voice and full scoring with an effortless artistry that wholly conceals the fact that several compositions stand upon an elaborately mathematical disposition of their successive and component proportions. He is representative of the English florid style of composition at not only its most assured, but also its most imaginative. Few closing periods approach in breadth and sweep the &#145;Salve&#146; concluding Browne's five-voice <span class="italic">Salve regina</span>, or in poignancy the setting of &#145;gaudia&#146; ending <span class="italic">Stabat iuxta Christi crucem</span> and, long before the contrivances of the madrigalists, he could create in his masterpiece, the six-voice <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span>, a mood of brooding, despairing introspection and melancholy that gathers an inexorable momentum and energy until its eruption into a startling and percussive outburst of &#145;Crucifige, crucifige!&#146; (&#145;Crucify, crucify!&#146;) that is articulated at the very top of the treble register and represents the work's greatest climax&#151;an unforgettable piece of composition unequalled anywhere in the European music of its time.<br>
