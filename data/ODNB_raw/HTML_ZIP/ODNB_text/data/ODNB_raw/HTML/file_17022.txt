</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lort,  Michael</span>  (1724/5&#150;1790), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, a descendant of a Pembrokeshire family, was the eldest child of Roger Lort (1693/4&#150;1745) of Tenby, a major in the Royal Welch Fusiliers who died of wounds after the battle of Fontenoy, and his wife, Anne (1697/8&#150;1767), only child of Edward Jenkins, vicar of Fareham in Hampshire. His brothers and sisters all died before him; his sister Anne was the mother of William Lort Mansel, bishop of Bristol. Lort was educated at Evans's school, Tenby, and William Cole claimed that he went on to Westminster School, but there is no evidence of that in the school registers  (Brydges, 1.469). He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in June 1743 as a pensioner aged eighteen and proceeded BA (1747), MA (1750), BD (1761), and DD (1780). He was incorporated at Oxford on 7 July 1759. Trinity elected him to a fellowship in 1749 and he vacated it in March 1781.<br>
<br>After graduation Lort became librarian to one of the great collectors of the age, Dr Richard Mead, until Mead's death in 1754. He was ordained priest in March 1754 and for the rest of his life he held numerous appointments both clerical and lay. Elected to the regius professorship of Greek at Cambridge in 1759 he enjoyed it virtually as a sinecure for twelve years, and left not even so much as a faded reputation as a classicist. Even the Greek verses above his name in several university collections were not his own but those of Thomas Zouch. He was debarred by the terms of this professorship from holding other offices in Cambridge and from proceeding to his doctor's degree so that by 1764 he was considering whether to apply for the university librarianship if it fell vacant. This came to nothing, and in 1768 he also failed to secure the regius professorship of modern history which went to his friend Thomas Gray.<br>
<br>In 1761 Lort had become chaplain to the bishop of Peterborough, and was vicar of Bottisham, Cambridgeshire, from 1763 to 1770; from 1771 until his death he was rector of St Matthew's, Friday Street, London. During 1776 he accompanied Levett Hanson on a continental tour. He served as domestic chaplain to Archbishop Frederick Cornwallis, a great friend of the dean of Ely whose wife was a kinswoman of Lort, between September 1779 and 1783 when a visiting American, Thomas Hutchinson, heard him race &#145;through the litany as fast as a clerk would have gone through an instrument which was mere matter of form&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters of &hellip; Thomas Hutchinson</span>, 2.318). He was given a prebend at St Paul's Cathedral in 1780 which he held until his death. Lort married on 19 May 1783 Susannah (<i>bap</i>. 1741, <i>d</i>. 1792), the daughter of William Norfolk, a Cambridge alderman, and his wife, Susannah. They had no children. In 1785 he became librarian to the archbishop at Lambeth, and he also had a position in the duke of Devonshire's household as keeper of his coins and medals; he was described in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> as &#145;the Duke's Antiquary&#146;  (15 Sept 1788). To these preferments Lort added the living of St Michael, Mile End, near Colchester, to which he was collated in 1789, and the sinecure rectory of Fulham, Middlesex, for six months before his death.<br>
<br>Lort was in touch with many scholars whose tastes and interests he shared, and he was a fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries from 1755 (he resigned after some time as its vice-president in 1788) and of the Royal Society from 1766. A great deal of his correspondence survives and parts of it, such as those with Walpole and Bishop Percy, have been printed. He was a friend and executor of the numismatist George North and inherited (with Anthony Askew) his books and other collections, and gave John Nichols a memoir of him. He was generous in supplying information to others, and especially obliging to Horace Walpole who had a high regard for him, and was indebted to him for many researches and for acting as an intermediary with Richard Gough. He made careful investigations into Chatterton and the Rowley forgeries, even travelling to Bristol to interview those who knew the poet; he resolutely defended Walpole's conduct in the affair. He helped James Granger with his book on portraiture and was an early patron of John Carter, the architectural draughtsman. His manuscripts are the basis of certain biographies in Alexander Chalmers's biographical dictionary, and of &#145;The whole duty of man&#146;, an account that Nichols later printed in <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>. He also gave Nichols assistance with his history of Lambeth.<br>
<br>Lort published only a few short pieces on his own account: an obsequious sermon given to the university on the anniversary of the accession of George II (1760), and another preached at Lambeth on the consecration of the bishop of Peterborough (1770); a Tudor document given him by Thomas Astle concerning the constitution and officers of the university whose publication in 1769 coincided with the installation of the duke of Grafton as chancellor; a short commentary on the Lord's prayer (1790); a letter to the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> (5 September 1771) to complain of scurrilous attacks on the king in the press; a few notes for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>; and papers for <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>. Like many of his kind he projected works that never appeared; there are, for example, fragmentary notes for a history of Trinity College  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Gough Camb. 54), and a life of Bentley was hardly started. He wrote to Walpole in 1760 to say he lived among books and loved to &#145;tumble them over&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 16.141), and he was an inveterate annotator of his library, which was sold after his death in April and May 1791. Fanny Burney met Lort often and found that&#151;when not inadvertently embarrassing her with talk of <span class="italic">Evelina</span>&#151;he could be &#145;comical and diverting&#146;, in manner &#145;somewhat blunt and odd&#146;, and &#145;curious in every species of antiquity, and difficult in none&#146;, while Susannah Lort was &#145;a most light and merry-hearted dame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay</span>, 1.91, 476, 4.408&#150;9).<br>
<br>In August 1790 Lort was thrown from his carriage on a hill at Colchester; he died from his injuries on 5 November at his London home, 6 Savile Row. He was buried in St Matthew's, Friday Street, where Susannah Lort erected a memorial tablet; she died on 5 February 1792 and was also buried there. When the church was demolished in 1883 their remains were removed to the City of London cemetery at Ilford.<br>
