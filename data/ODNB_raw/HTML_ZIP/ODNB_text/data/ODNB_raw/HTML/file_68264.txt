<span class="headword">Wilson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1800&#150;1839), <span class="occ">dancing-master and writer</span>, was active in London during the early nineteenth century. His career probably began at the King's Theatre Opera House; from the early 1800s he taught at his own dancing academy, variously based at Bedford Row, Ludgate Hill, and Hatton Garden, where he was assisted by Mrs Wilson and sufficient staff to form sets for any of the social dances then popular.<br>
<br>The first work definitely attributed to Wilson is <span class="italic">An Analysis of Country Dancing</span>, first published in 1808, followed by the <span class="italic">Treasures of Terpsichore, or, A Companion for the Ballroom</span> (1809; not to be confused with Carlo Blassis' <span class="italic">The Code of Terpsichore</span> of 1818). Second and third editions of the <span class="italic">Analysis</span> followed in 1811. In 1815 Wilson published another version of the <span class="italic">Analysis</span>, retitled <span class="italic">The Complete System of English Country Dancing</span> (reprinted, 1816, 1817, 1820, 1821, and 1828), and a new work, <span class="italic">The Quadrille Instructor</span>. The following year brought two new works: <span class="italic">A Companion to the Ballroom</span> and <span class="italic">A Description of the Correct Method of French and German Waltzing</span>. This last probably followed the appearance of the shocking new dance at the prince regent's ball on 13 July 1816, and its introduction to Almack's assembly rooms by one of its patronesses, Princess Lieven, a leading London society hostess. Further editions of the <span class="italic">Companion</span>, the <span class="italic">Correct Method</span>, and a brief volume describing <span class="italic">The Celebrated and Fashionable Dance &#145;La Batteuse&#146;</span> were published in 1817.<br>
<br>In 1818 Wilson published <span class="italic">The Ecossoise Instructor</span>, one of few manuals devoted to this dance, which he termed &#145;a new species of dancing&#146;, citing the dance's popularity at the Russian court. Wilson's <span class="italic">Quadrille and Cotillion Panorama</span> (1818; repr. 1839) reflected the growing popularity of the quadrille, which gradually replaced the cotillion after the French Revolution. A second edition, prefaced by &#145;The address, or, An essay in deportment&#146; was published in 1822 and a third in 1839 with additions and illustrations. In 1821 Wilson published <span class="italic">Plot Against Plot</span>, a comedy performed at his private theatricals.<br>
<br>In 1822 Wilson held his eighty-ninth public ball, which began with a dramatic prelude attacking the current standards of dance teaching, intended &#145;to caution the public against some impostors, those self-named &#147;Professors&#148; yclept Dancing Masters&#146;. In this Wilson denounced those he considered charlatans, and threatened to name those he felt should be exposed if they continued teaching. The sketch was later published in 1824 as <span class="italic">The Danciad, or, Dancer's Monitor</span>.<br>
<br>In 1825 Wilson published his <span class="italic">Analysis of the London Ball-Room</span> which included quadrilles, waltzes and a selection of music, prefaced by a history of dancing from ancient times, through Tudor and Restoration, to later performers such as Grimaldi Nicolini. This appears to have been his last new work.<br>
<br>Wilson's work at the theatre&#151;where he would have helped to train many of the opera dancers&#151;together with his teaching and writing activities, had a direct impact on the style and performance of social dancing. He was very much a traditionalist, preferring the allemande or German style of waltz, in which the dancers had intertwining arms, to the close hold which so scandalized sections of society, and which became beloved of the aristocracy.<br>
<br>Wilson's manuals explain the figures in text and illustration, and several are accompanied by music suitable for each dance, and all fully describe the correct style and manner of performance, together with the correct ballroom etiquette expected of both ladies and gentlemen. This was an issue on which Wilson was at great pains to instruct his readers, as he feared standards of dancing would be &#145;perverted into a chaos of riot and confusion&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Treasures of Terpsichore</span>) if left to decline any further.<br>
<br>Despite his assertion of his own professional good standing, Wilson's works were not always received with approval from his colleagues. W. M. S. Chivers in <span class="italic">The Modern Dancing Master</span> (1822) quotes James Cassidy's 1810 manual <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Theory and Practice of Dancing</span>, which urges that the <span class="italic">Treasures of Terpsichore</span> &#145;should be universally exploded as unintelligible and useless, though nothing more than an elementary indication of the art, or an explanation &hellip; of some of the technical terms of it&#146;.<br>
<br>Some modern writers have commented that Wilson's figure descriptions can be difficult to follow, and that the more complicated, balletic steps that Wilson included were in fact the province of only a few extremely accomplished dancers. Despite Wilson's traditional and conservative stance, later generations are indebted to him for a comprehensive description of the most popular social dances of this period.<br>
