<span class="headword">Cossor,  Alfred Charles</span>  (1861&#150;1922), <span class="occ">manufacturer of electronic and medical equipment</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 8 July 1861, the elder son of Alfred Charles Cossor and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Freeman. He joined his father's business making thermometers and barometers, in 1875, but left in 1890 to set up his own business as a scientific glass-blower in Clerkenwell. Cossor was then able to take advantage of the expansion in electrical studies during the final decade of the nineteenth century; colleges and research laboratories were a ready market for his sealed vacuum tubes. His customers included Sir William Crookes, who was investigating the properties of electrical discharges in a vacuum.<br>
<br>Crookes's researches were followed up by physicists in several countries. R&ouml;ntgen, in Vienna, discovered the short-wavelength X-rays in 1895. The subsequent demand for X-ray tubes, both for research and for medical diagnosis, created a profitable market for Cossor's products; he later claimed, in his company's advertisements, that he was the first to make these tubes in Britain. Another important development from Crookes's work was Braun's invention of the cathode ray tube in Germany; here, again, Cossor claimed that his own cathode ray tubes were, in 1902, the first to be produced in Britain.<br>
<br>In 1892 Cossor married Alice, the daughter of George Parker, an estate bailiff. After her death he married Elsie Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vincent, in 1919.<br>
<br>All the devices produced by Cossor in the nineteenth century had been intended for medical or scientific research laboratories. But during the first decade of the twentieth century he started making apparatus for the rapidly growing commercial market. He supplemented his output of X-ray tubes with miniature electric light bulbs for surgical probes; he later marketed similar, but somewhat larger bulbs for miners' lamps and motor-car headlamps. He also made his first thermionic radio valve in 1907, but mainly as an experiment, for such valves had limited practical application while their use was the subject of patent litigation between the leading radio companies.<br>
<br>In 1908 Cossor formed a new limited company, A. C. Cossor. He was joined by a young Australian engineer, W. R. Bullimore, who took over the day-to-day running of the business. Cossor himself performed the less onerous duties of company chairman. By the outbreak of the First World War he had retired to Fawley in Hampshire, leaving Bullimore virtually in charge. The change in management came at about the same time as a large increase in orders for radio valves from the armed services, obliging the company to move to larger premises at Highbury in north London, where extra production capacity could be installed. Bullimore expanded radio component production after the war, and in 1922 launched a new range of high quality valves to coincide with the formation of the BBC. Expansion continued after Cossor's death with the manufacture of radio receivers and, in the late 1930s and 1940s, of television sets and radar equipment based on the company's valves and cathode ray tubes.<br>
<br>When he founded his business, Cossor was regarded by the few scientists who knew him as one of the country's best glass-blowers. At and after his death his name was recognized nationwide as a manufacturer of radio equipment for a large domestic market. Ironically, this increasing fame had been brought about mainly by Bullimore's enterprise rather than by Cossor himself!<br>
<br>Relieved of his business responsibilities, Cossor took an active part in local affairs at Fawley, serving as churchwarden and as harbour master. He was interested in the conservation of Fawley, and particularly in the restoration of the parish church. He was a member of the London lodge of freemasons. He died at his home, Fawley Cottage, Fawley, on 27 May 1922, survived by his second wife.<br>
