<span class="headword">Pilkington,  Leonard</span>  (1527&#150;1599), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Rivington, Lancashire, the fifth of seven sons of Richard Pilkington, esquire (<i>c</i>.1486&#150;1551), and his wife, Alice, daughter of Laurence or Lawrence Ashawe of Hall on the Hill, Heath Charnock, Lancashire. Pilkington matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar, and graduated BA there in 1544. Appointed a fellow at St John's on 24 March 1546, he proceeded MA the following year. He was named mathematical examiner at St John's on 5 September 1548, lecturer in mathematics in 1550, and a senior fellow on 4 September 1551. Nicholas Ridley ordained him deacon at St Paul's, London, on 15 May 1552, and Pilkington was appointed preacher at St John's at Michaelmas in the same year. Shortly after Mary's accession he was ejected from his fellowship, and like his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22269/', "James Pilkington")</script> fled to the continent. He may have gone to Frankfurt am Main, for one of the Pilkingtons arbitrated in a dispute concerning the eucharist in that city's French congregation in late March 1559. While he was in exile Pilkington married his first wife, Katherine; they had five children, Alice (<i>d</i>. after 1602), Grace (<i>d</i>. 1632), Barnabas (<i>d</i>. 1607), Nehemiah (<i>d</i>. 1602), and Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1622).<br>
<br>Following Elizabeth's accession Pilkington returned to England. After his wife died, the visitors restored him to his fellowship at St John's on 27 December 1559, and he was ordained priest at Ely in November 1560, appointed Hebrew lecturer at St John's on 14 January 1561, and collated to the rectory of Middleton in Teesdale, Durham, including the chapel at nearby Eggleston, on 20 March 1561. He was licensed as a university preacher on 6 June 1561, and, at Robert Beaumont's suggestion, named master at St John's on 19 October 1561, succeeding his brother James, who was now bishop of Durham. In the same year Pilkington received the degree of BTh and was named regius professor of theology, but he resigned this post the following year and was succeeded by Matthew Hutton. On 28 August 1563 James Pilkington collated Leonard to the rectory of Whitburn, Durham, where he amassed a substantial copyhold estate, and where in 1575 he became enmeshed in a dispute with a parishioner over tithes owed for a windmill. He became DTh on 28 January 1564. After securing William Fulke's election as fellow and preacher at St John's in March 1564, Pilkington resigned his mastership in May, having worked to obtain the appointment of Richard Longworth as his successor on the 11th. He was collated to a canonry in Durham Cathedral on 1 August 1567; installed on 6 September, he held this prebend until his death.<br>
<br>Following James Pilkington's death in 1576, Leonard and his younger brother John became overseers of the grammar school at Rivington which James had founded. For failing to attend a visitation conducted by Robert Swift, chancellor of Durham, at Middleton in Teesdale, Pilkington was excommunicated on 6 February 1578, though he was absolved five days later and excused from another visitation in July. By this time the diocese of Durham had become a centre of controversy, having attracted a number of forward protestants, including Dean William Whittingham and such prebendaries as Pilkington himself, his brother John, Ralph Lever, Thomas Lever (deprived in 1567), and John Foxe (who resigned in 1573). The visitations in early 1578 were the forerunners of another in October, when Archbishop Sandys of York quarrelled first with Whittingham, who denied Sandys's right to visit, and then with Dean Matthew Hutton of York, who had supported the dean of Durham. Pilkington weathered the storm, and in June 1579 he and his brother John sought Sir Francis Walsingham's assistance in finding a new dean. In 1592 he was appointed cathedral treasurer.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1597 Pilkington married his second wife, Jayne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyllycotes), widow of Richard Barnes, bishop of Durham. They had no children. He died in August 1599, probably at Durham, and was buried in the cathedral there. In his will, dated 16 November 1598 and proved on 8 September 1599, he noted that four of his children had already received their inheritances: Barnabas, a house and copyhold at Whitburn and nearby Cleadon, with other gifts, amounting to approximately &pound;600; Joseph, money, three farms, and stock worth at least &pound;400 altogether; and Grace, wife of Dr Robert Hutton (Matthew Hutton's nephew), and Alice, wife of Francis Laycock, portions of &pound;200 apiece. To Nehemiah, a minor, Pilkington gave a farm at Hedworth, tithes at Harton, Durham, and half his personal property. Small bequests were given to his widow, relatives, and the poor, and 20 nobles were provided for road repair in the Durham area. To Cambridge he bequeathed seventeen books and a manuscript of &AElig;lfric's homilies. Jayne Pilkington was buried next to her husband on 20 June 1605.<br>
