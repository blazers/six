<span class="headword">O'More,  Rory Oge</span> <span class="st"> [Ruaidhri  &Oacute;g Ua Mordha]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1578), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was the eldest son of <a href="#cosubject_20760">Rory Caoch MacConnell O'More [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas Butler and granddaughter of Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond. <a name="cosubject_20760"></a><span class="headword">Rory  Caoch MacConnell O'More</span> <span class="st"> [Ruaidhr&iacute;  Caoch Ua Mordha]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1545), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was the son of Connell O'More (<i>d</i>. 1537), chieftain, of Leix (Laois) and succeeded his father as chieftain of Leix in 1537. Rory Caoch (&#145;the one-eyed&#146; or &#145;the blind&#146;) was captain of Leix. The O'More family was one of the most important of the minor Irish septs, or clans, and among the most implacable opponents of the government's policy of plantation because their lands, along with the O'Connor lands, were the first to be appropriated for this scheme. Rory Caoch's elder brother Kedagh succeeded Connell after much internal fighting. Kedagh died early in 1542 and was succeeded by Rory Caoch.<br>
<br>The government's botched attempts to protect the pale against raids by outlying septs after Kildare's rebellion (1534&#150;5) engendered anarchy in the midlands. Sir Anthony St Leger, the lord deputy, opted for a policy of conciliation through the conclusion of a surrender and regrant arrangement with Rory Caoch on 13 May 1542. However, this failed to stabilize the pale because Rory Caoch was deposed and murdered by his younger brother Giollaph&aacute;draig in 1545. Following the prosecution of that usurper the government, weary of Irish raids against the pale, decided to plant soldier&#150;settlers in Leix and Offaly (later renamed Queen's county and King's county) to contain the native population. In 1549 the first contingents of these colonists arrived in Leix-Offaly to take up their grants, but it was not until 1556 that the colony was officially established. The O'Mores, now under the leadership of Connell Oge MacConnell (<i>d</i>. 1557), refused to acquiesce in the scheme, and began to raid the settlements from hideaways in the impenetrable Gallen woods of western Leix after 1556. As native resistance hardened, Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, the lord deputy, resorted increasingly to martial law to maintain order. Connell Oge was hanged in chains from Leighlin Bridge, co. Carlow, in 1557, but resistance continued sporadically until 1564, by which time thirty-five of the leading O'Mores had been killed by the colonists, who quickly earned a reputation for high-handedness among the Irish: &#145;If it were ones spoken of a &hellip; captens mouthe it was a sufficient quarell for the capten to rob, pray and kill the person &hellip; and all his tenantes withowt other attoryte or commiscon then the captens owne allegacon&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/1/84).<h2>
<a name="RoryOgeOMoresearlyyearsc15401571"></a>Rory Oge O'More's early years, c.1540&#150;1571</h2>Sir Henry Sidney, the lord deputy, described Rory Oge as an &#145;obscure and base varlet&#146;, despite the importance of the O'More sept. Rory Oge was the most vigorous and most notorious leader of the midland septs opposed to the government's expropriation of their lands. His main significance was that he came to typify the incorrigibility of the Gaelic &eacute;lite in the eyes of the New English. Little is known of his formative years. He was fostered with the O'Byrnes for a time, probably with Hugh MacShane O'Byrne, chief of the Gabhal Raghnaill branch of the O'Byrne clan, given the extent of Rory Oge's attachment to his family. He was close to Hugh MacShane's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20477/', "Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne (c.1544&#150;1597)")</script>, and married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1577), daughter of Hugh MacShane O'Byrne and his first wife, Sadhbh, about 1573. Among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60788/', "Owny MacRory O'More (b. in or before 1577, d. 1600)")</script>. Rory Oge's sept, the MacRorys, was left landless as a result of the reorganization of landholding in Leix in 1564. Rory Oge was forced to enter the service of Sir John Fitzgerald of Desmond, the younger brother of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, as a swordsman. He returned to Leix by 1570 and began negotiations with the government for a grant of lands, similar to those granted to his cousins Laoighseach and Cathaoir MacKedagh in 1566.<br>
<br>How Rory Oge emerged as leader of the O'Mores in rebellion against the government less than a year later is somewhat unclear. The decisive factor may have been Sidney's arbitrary execution of Laoighseach and Cathaoir MacKedagh, who were both implicated in the Butler revolt in 1569&#150;70. Sidney subsequently decided to &#145;bare such a hand upon the whole name of the OMores as I trust the Quenes countye shalbe a quiet countye&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/30/52). Rory Oge survived the 1570 purge only because he was in the service of Francis Cosby, seneschal of Queen's county, and occupant of Stradbally, his paternal inheritance in co. Leix (now Laois). He was suspicious of Sidney's intentions and refused to meet government officials. In February 1571 Sir William Fitzwilliam, Sidney's successor as lord deputy, observed that Rory Oge was gathering men from among the disgruntled midland septs, and appeared about to &#145;go out&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/31/8). Rory Oge secured election as chief of his sept in April and rebelled in May.<h2>
<a name="Firstrebellion15711577"></a>First rebellion, 1571&#150;1577</h2>That Rory Oge rebelled in order to avenge his kin was suggested by a number of sources, and also by his own indictment of the government's policy towards the leading O'Mores: &#145;farr betters of his name submytted them selves to the late Lord Deputy and sarved him and that they were after taken and executed&#146;. He refused to disperse his men for this reason, claiming he &#145;hath no other assurance of his lyfe&#146;. Yet the hidden intention of Rory Oge's rebellion, as Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, and Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare, with whom he parleyed in August 1572, surmised, was to put pressure on the government to grant him the barony of &#145;Gallen &hellip; which he sought afore&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/37/37). Rory Oge subsequently submitted and was pardoned after this, while his claim was sent for government arbitration.<br>
<br>In December 1572, having received no response to his petitions, Rory Oge resumed hostilities in order to hasten consideration of his claim. His use of guerrilla warfare against the settlers proved impossible to contain, especially because he adopted the brutal methods of the midlands planters, using them against the same, which won him much support from the region's dispossessed Gaelic &eacute;lite. Supported by the O'Connors, O'Byrnes, and O'Kavanaghs, Rory Oge used the densely wooded area of Gallen as a base. In &#145;smalle companies or grete, as ocascon requireth or as the turn is best sarved, the rebel issueth into the heart of the Queens Countye and thence into every parte of the Pale spoylinge the same at pleasure&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/38/41). Indeed, by February 1573 so effective had Rory Oge's campaign proved that the government was considering methods &#145;of so manie circumstances, as it cannot be so comitted to writing but it will admit matters disputable&#146;, to end his rebellion  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/39/27). In another effort to advance his petitions he again submitted (November 1573) but immediately aided the earl of Desmond's escape from Dublin later that month, providing a 400-strong escort for the fugitive through the midlands.<br>
<br>No resolution had been achieved by 1575, when Sidney, again lord deputy, observed that Rory Oge &#145;hath that Possession, and Settling Place&#146; in Leix, and &#145;listeth and wasteth what he will&#146;. Recognizing that the devastated midlands would continue to suffer unless Rory Oge was given a living, Sidney offered him lands, provided he accepted the plantation. Rory Oge submitted in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, &#145;repenting (as he said) his former Fawltes, and promisinge hereafter, to lyve in better Sorte (for woorsse than he hath ben he cannot be)&#146;. He was, however, more ambitious than before and Sidney warned him that unless he abandoned his &#145;aspiringe imagination of tytle to the countrie&#146; he would lose &#145;lyffe, land and all&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/54/17). Although Rory Oge was pardoned on 4 June 1576, Sidney, disquieted by his continuing claim to authority over Leix, did not settle his demands.<h2>
<a name="Secondrebellion15771578"></a>Second rebellion, 1577&#150;1578</h2>In March 1577, after ten months of peace, Rory Oge broke the stalemate through a devastating raid, and burnt to the ground the town of Naas, co. Kildare. This sealed his fate. Sidney decided drastic action was required and Cosby received an extensive commission of martial law authorizing him to eradicate &#145;with fire and sword Rory Oge &hellip; and all other traitors and rebels in any place where they may be found&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Fiants</span>, no. 2997). By August 150 O'Mores had been killed. As his programme and reputation were subjected to unprecedented criticism, Sidney's frustration with Rory Oge, whom he made a paradigm of the opposition he was encountering in Ireland, clearly boiled over. Infuriated by mounting costs and constant resistance, he decided to wage &#145;as actuall and as cunning warre&#146; upon Rory Oge as possible  (Sidney, 1860, 185). A sea change in governmental attitudes to the Irish population occurred, and some New English officials were already articulating the view that normal ethical restraints did not apply when dealing with the native Irish. A rare contemporary Gaelic source states that Rory Oge was subjected to unprecedented attention, relating how his wife, Margaret, was killed on government orders, &#145;and with her have been killed women, and boys, and humble folk, and people young and old, who, according to all seeming, deserved not to be put to the sword&#146; (&#145;agus mna agus macaim agus mindaoine oga agus arsaidhi do marbhadh maille ria nach ar thuill a marbhadh do fer bharamhla&#146;; Royal Irish Academy, MS 24.14.170).<br>
<br>As the hunt for Rory Oge intensified, the authorities were confounded by their continued failure to apprehend him: &#145;for never Wretche, beinge so longe and earnestlye followed, hath continued on Foote so longe&#146;. His frequent narrow escapes from his pursuers were attributed to &#145;Sorcerie or Enchauntement&#146;, as he assumed the guise of bogeyman for the English soldiers and administrators  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/61/29). Sir Nicholas Malby, governor of Connaught, described Rory Oge as the only Robin Hood of Ireland, while John Derricke characterized him as a wolf. In 1599 his reputation as a demonic force was confirmed when Sir John Harington, the courtier and author, wrote that he had escaped his pursuers &#145;by dint of witchery, and had by magic compelled them not to touch him&#146;  (Harington, 2.23&#150;4).<br>
<br>In November 1577 Rory Oge captured two leading figures of the midland garrison, Alexander Cosby and Henry Harington, Sidney's nephew, whom he paraded in chains &#145;like a slave&#146;. Thereafter the dispute with Sidney assumed an even more personal edge because the lord deputy was outraged by the slight on his family's honour. Even when trapped by Sidney's forces in a cabin, Rory Oge managed to break Harington's arm, to &#145;cutt off the little finger of one of his handes&#146; and to inflict serious head injuries, before &#145;miraculously&#146; escaping through the legs of his besiegers. Sidney's forces then proceeded to massacre the cabin's remaining occupants, including Rory Oge's wife and two young sons  (Sidney, 1860, 185&#150;6). Rory Oge responded in kind, burning Leighlin and Carlow and beheading those soldiers he could capture.<br>
<br>In March 1578 the government's frustration was revealed when its forces, including Cosby, massacred some of Rory Oge's supporters at Mullaghmast, co. Kildare. Since the O'Mores had convened there under a protection for parley, the Irish annalists were prompted to claim that &#145;no uglier deed than that was ever committed in Ireland&#146; (&#145;n&iacute; dhearnadh in &Eacute;irinn riamh gn&iacute;omh ba ghr&aacute;nna n&aacute; sin&#146;; Hennessy, vol. 2, s.a. 1567 [<i>sic</i>]). By this point the noose around Rory Oge was tightening. Attempting to ease the pressure, on 30 June he tried to entice one of his most dogged pursuers, Barnaby Fitzpatrick, second baron of Upper Ossory, into an ambush. Anticipating treachery, Upper Ossory concealed the kerne (light foot soldiers) he had with him, and, when Rory Oge appeared:<blockquote>the Lord of Upperosseries Kerne, gave the chardge upon hym, and at their Reencounter one of theim light upon hym, and thrust hym presentlye thorough the Boddie with his Swoorde, which was no soner donne, but twoe or three more likewise hacked upon hym at once, and gave hym soch mortall Woundes, as downe he fell: and this was the Ende of this rancke Rebell. (Collins, 1.263&#150;5)</blockquote>Despite attempts by Upper Ossory's men to seize it, Rory Oge's body was carried off by his own followers; however, the head was attained soon after and delivered to Sidney, who had it mounted on Dublin Castle. The annalists recorded of Rory Oge that &#145;there was not in Ireland a greater destroyer against foreigners than that man: and he was a very great loss&#146; (&#145;agus n&iacute; raibh a nEirinn fear millte ar Ghaill b&aacute; mh&oacute; n&aacute; fear sin agus f&aacute; ro m&oacute;r&#146;; Hennessy, vol. 2, s.a. 1578).<br>
<br>Rory Oge's death marked the end of O'More efforts to restore the old order of Gaelic lordship, or at least to secure a stake in the plantation. Although his son Owny MacRory O'More managed to raise the O'More banner again in the 1590s, it was only with the support of Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone. Never again were the O'Mores capable of threatening either the pale or the midlands plantation. On a wider plane Rory Oge's career was critical in the breakdown of the conciliation strategy. Derricke's <span class="italic">Image of Irelande</span> (1581) reveals the role Rory Oge played in the changing New English mentality. Rory Oge was characterized as a savage wood kerne addicted by nature to rapine and rebellion and depicted as &#145;a lively image and pattern of rebellion&#146;, rather than as a dispossessed member of the Irish &eacute;lite fighting for his lands. He was cast as the leader of a &#145;crooked generation&#146;, whose &#145;ireful hearts&#146; were &#145;bent to every kind of ill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Image of Irelande</span>, 183&#150;8, 199&#150;205). Both contemporary Gaelic commentators and critics of the New English administration identified in the period 1549&#150;78 an increasing breakdown in the rules of war in the midlands. This affected the conduct of New English settlers in their dealings with the disaffected Irish &eacute;lite. Rory Oge's significance is that he provided the most potent symbol of Irish opposition to the government's reform effort. The government's solution to his vigorous and determined campaign was extermination. Some 725 O'Mores were killed by 1578 and this departure from normal ethical conventions provided the ideological conditions for the wars of extermination in Munster and Ulster which completed the conquest of Ireland at the close of the sixteenth century.<br>
