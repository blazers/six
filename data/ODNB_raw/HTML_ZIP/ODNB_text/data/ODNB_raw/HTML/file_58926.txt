<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Turner,  Benjamin Brecknell</span>  (1815&#150;1894), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 12 May 1815 at 31&#150;2 Haymarket, London, the eldest son of Samuel Turner (1784&#150;1841) and Lucy Jane Fownes (1786&#150;1870). He was apprenticed to his father at the age of sixteen as a tallow chandler and later ran the family firm of Brecknell, Turner Ltd, which made candles, soap, and saddle soap. The factory and shop were at 31&#150;2 Haymarket. However, Turner is best-known as a pioneering amateur photographer of the 1850s. According to family tradition, he took up William Henry Fox Talbot's calotype process in 1849&#151;but it was probably seeing the display of photographs at the Great Exhibition of 1851 that sharpened his ambition. Turner assembled a majestic album of his photographs from the years 1852&#150;4 and opened the sequence with two remarkable views of the interior of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park taken in March 1852&#151;when Paxton's iron and glass structure had been emptied of exhibits before being dismantled and rebuilt at Sydenham. Turner's photographs capture the light-filled interior's revolutionary scale and elegance of engineering. His finesse in composing subjects, and adroit handling of a large camera, is witnessed by the other photographs in the album, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. His characteristic subjects were English abbeys, castles, cottages, and farms. Many of his finest photographs were made in or around the Worcestershire village of Bredicot, where he married Agnes Chamberlain (1828&#150;1887) on 17 August 1847. They and their eight children spent many summers at Bredicot Court, the Chamberlain family home.<br>
<br>Unlike nearly all other British photographers, Turner remained faithful to Talbot's calotype process for most of his career. However, after beginning with small negatives at the start of his career (1849&#150;51) Turner's later paper negatives were on a heroic scale&#151;usually about 26 by 38 cm. Turner exhibited regularly and with critical success from 1852 onwards, when six of his photographs appeared in the world's first ever purely photographic exhibition, organized by the Society of Arts in London. His paper (rather than glass) negatives&#151;almost always printed on albumen-coated papers&#151;gave a broad, textured handsomeness to his photographs of the canonical picturesque subjects&#151;vernacular architecture, farm carts and implements, rick yards, and ivy-clad ruins. The collection of some 250 paper negatives by Turner preserved by the Royal Photographic Society (and now in the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford) demonstrates that he was not merely a &#145;straight&#146; photographer: he compensated for the shortcomings of his negatives by adding pencilled foliage details, for example, or blacking out skies with Indian ink. About 1855 he built a glasshouse above the family home and business premises in the Haymarket and made portraits of friends, relatives, business associates, and fellow photographers. For these he used the wet collodion on glass process introduced in 1852. He also experimented with collodion negatives for landscape subjects in 1856 but the results lacked the charm of his works from paper, to which he immediately returned.<br>
<br>Turner had a high reputation among critics, connoisseurs, and collectors in the 1850s. His work was constantly praised by reviewers of the time. He exhibited at the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1855&#151;a major milestone for photography in France&#151;and was awarded a bronze medal. Turner was a founder member and later a vice-president of the Photographic Society of London (founded 1853). He was also an honorary secretary and treasurer of the Photographic Club, within the society, which produced large and beautiful albums of photographs in 1855 and 1857. Members used the albums as a means of exchanging their works. Turner organized the 1857 album. These albums are now treasured by students of photography, as are Turner's own prints and negatives; they are to be found in the great museums around the world. Turner died at 133 Tulse Hill, Brixton, London, on 29 April 1894. The first exhibition devoted to his work took place in April 2001 at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
