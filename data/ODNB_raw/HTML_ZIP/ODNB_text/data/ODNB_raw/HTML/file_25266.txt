<span class="headword">Shaw,  Robert Barkley</span>  (1839&#150;1879), <span class="occ">explorer and government agent</span>, son of Robert Grant Shaw, of Box, Wiltshire, and his wife, Martha Barkley, was born at Upper Clapton, London, on 12 July 1839. His sister Anna married Robert Younghusband. He was educated at schools on the continent, at Marlborough College, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1859 but did not take a degree. The effects of rheumatic fever forced him to give up the idea of entering the army, and in 1859 he went to Kunyara in the Himalayas, where he settled as a tea planter.<br>
<br>Eager for adventure, he decided to explore the country north of the Karakoram; and, after one or two tentative excursions, he started in May 1868 for eastern Turkestan, travelling as a merchant, and taking with him trading goods, a prismatic compass, and a translation of Herodotus's <span class="italic">History</span>. He reached Yarkand on 8 December, and Kashgar on 11 January 1869, being the first Englishman to visit those places. At Kashgar, though not allowed to enter the city, he was treated graciously by Yakub Beg, the ruler of the country, who, mainly in consequence of the advice given him by Shaw, dispatched an envoy to India asking that a British officer be sent to arrange a treaty. Shaw returned by the Karakoram Pass, and proceeded to England. His <span class="italic">Visit to High Tartary, Yarkand and Kashgar</span> appeared in 1871, but while preparing it for the press he heard that Lord Mayo had decided to send an official mission to eastern Turkestan and at once telegraphed an offer of his services; this was accepted, and he accompanied Douglas Forsyth on his first mission. Yakub Beg was far from Yarkand when they arrived there on 3 August 1870, and the mission came back with its principal object unachieved. Shaw returned to England, where in 1872 the Royal Geographical Society awarded him the patron's gold medal for his explorations in eastern Turkestan and especially for his valuable astronomical observations, which fixed the position of Yarkand, Kashgar, and other places.<br>
<br>In recognition of his service to the government, Lord Mayo appointed Shaw to the political department, and he was made British joint commissioner in Ladakh. In 1875 he went to Yarkand in charge of the ratified treaty made by Sir Douglas Forsyth in 1874. He continued to write, publishing on the Eastern Turkish language in 1875 and the Ghalchah languages in 1876. He also contributed to the Royal Geographical and Royal Asiatic societies' publications. In 1878 he was appointed resident at Mandalay in Upper Burma. During the troubles which followed the death of King Mengdun in October 1878, his position at the residency was one of great danger; but throughout the crisis he acted with courage and discretion. He wrote to King Thibaw, who was massacring kinsfolk and rivals wholesale, that if any further murders took place he should, without waiting for orders from Calcutta, at once haul down the British flag; and he sent at the same time his assistant to explain the consequences such a measure would involve. He was made CSI and died at Mandalay on 15 June 1879. He was unmarried.<br>
