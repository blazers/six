<span class="headword">Stephens,  Jane Tryphoena</span>  (1812?&#150;1896), <span class="occ">actress</span>, kept a tobacconist's shop at 39 Liverpool Road, Islington, London, before taking up a career on the stage in 1840. By that date she was married to Joseph Stephens, a solicitor's clerk, though she was sometimes billed as Miss Stephens; her maiden name is unknown. Her first appearance was on 8 February 1840 at the Olympic Theatre, London, then under the management of Samuel Butler, as Betty in <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Grubb</span>. After playing other soubrette parts in London she worked hard outside the capital for nearly three years, playing everything and anything. On her return to London in 1847 she was engaged for &#145;boys and walking ladies&#146; by Phelps at Sadler's Wells. Here, with the exception of one season with Mrs Warner at the Marylebone, she remained until 1852. In 1853 she joined the company of Charles Mathews at the Lyceum, where in 1854 she was Mrs Crab in a revival of <span class="italic">Hush Money</span> and in March 1857 she supported Robson as a country servant in <span class="italic">Daddy Hardacre</span> and in Palgrave Simpson's rendering of <span class="italic">La fille de l'avare</span>.<br>
<br>From 1858 to 1867 Jane Stephens was at the Olympic, playing fourteen seasons under four different managements, including that of Alfred Wigan. There she won her first great success as the original Mrs Willoughby in <span class="italic">Ticket of Leave Man</span>, Taylor's adaptation of <span class="italic">Leonard</span>; the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> of 1 June 1863 named her as one of the very best character actresses of the day. This type of part was to be her forte. On the opening of the Globe Theatre on 28 November 1865 she was the original Miss Pamela Grannet in Byron's <span class="italic">Cyril's Success</span>, a schoolmistress part where she showed a great hatred of men, which she hoped would be inculcated into her acquaintances. On 31 August 1867 she played, at the Adelphi, the Nurse in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> on the occasion of Kate Terry's farewell performance.<br>
<br>Stephens moved to the Holborn and in October 1867 was Mrs Mountflathwoult in Robertson's unsuccessful <span class="italic">For Love</span>. She was then at the Globe until 1872, playing among other parts, on 27 March 1872, Madame Valamour in <span class="italic">Broken Spells</span> by Westland Marston and W. G. Wills. She returned to the Olympic for three seasons under Neville from October 1873. She then moved to the Criterion in 1879, to the Princess's in 1881, and by March 1884 to the Prince's, where she was Miss Ashford in the <span class="italic">Private Secretary</span>, an adaptation by C. H. Hawtrey of <span class="italic">Der Bibliothekar</span> of von Moser. She then played other similar parts. Her farewell to the stage was on 9 July 1889 at an afternoon performance at the Shaftesbury Theatre, in which she appeared as Mrs Stonehenge Tattle in <span class="italic">Truth</span>. When she died of bronchitis at her home, St Bernard's, North Side, Clapham Common, London, on 15 January 1896 she was a widow in her eighty-fourth year; she was cremated on 20 January at Woking, Surrey.<br>
