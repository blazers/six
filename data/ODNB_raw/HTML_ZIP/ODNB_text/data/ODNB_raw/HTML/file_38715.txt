<span class="headword">Lyttelton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spencer]</span>,  Sarah</span>, Lady Lyttelton  (1787&#150;1870), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born at Althorp, Northamptonshire, on 29 July 1787, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer (1758&#150;1834)")</script>, and his wife, Lavinia Bingham (1762&#150;1831), daughter of the first Earl Lucan. Her youth was happy, if uneventful, spent among a large circle of family and friends. Her brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26133/', "John Charles Spencer")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26136/', "Robert Cavendish Spencer")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26122/', "Frederick Spencer")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26136/', "Spencer, Robert Cavendish")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38714/', "George Spencer")</script>. At Althorp she engaged in good works, teaching the village girls, and at Spencer House in London her family held a prominent place among the whig aristocracy, although she did not care greatly for the amusements of society. Her looks were described no more fulsomely than as &#145;pleasing&#146; and throughout her life she was shy, the result of her mother's sharply snubbing manner. A deeply religious evangelical, her warm and sympathetic nature made her the confidante of her family. On 3 March 1813 she married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17312/', "Hon. William Henry Lyttelton (1782&#150;1837)")</script>: Creevey described them as &#145;the happiest couple in the world&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). They had three sons and two daughters, whose upbringing was Lady Sarah's main preoccupation. On 12 November 1828, William Lyttelton succeeded his half-brother as third Baron Lyttelton, and Hagley Hall, near Stourbridge, in Worcestershire, became Lady Lyttelton's home. Lord Lyttelton's death on 30 April 1837 after a decade of ill health left her a widow, and the approaching marriage of her eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17307/', "George William Lyttelton")</script>, to Mary Glynne, made her feel it appropriate to leave Hagley.<br>
<br>In 1837, Lady Lyttelton was offered the position of lady of the bedchamber to the young Queen Victoria, and, her mourning for her husband over, she went into waiting for the first time on 2 October 1838, attending the queen at her marriage in 1840. Her sympathetic disposition made her a favourite at court, although she felt that she &#145;blundered and boggled as usual&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 279) in her tasks of handing the queen her shawl, her bouquet, bag, or opera glasses. In 1842 Prince Albert reorganized the royal household, and the nursery in particular, and Lady Lyttelton was appointed governess. She took up her position, which was no sinecure, in April 1842, taking charge of the preliminary education of the princess royal and the prince of Wales, who nicknamed her &#145;Laddle&#146;. She found her position agreeable, despite difficulties with the prince of Wales, about whom she remarked &#145;my heavy burden [is] increased to a crushing weight when I think of that child&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 362). She enjoyed the full confidence of both Victoria and Albert, except perhaps on questions of religion; but was, nevertheless, diffident about her competence.<br>
<br>In October 1850 her youngest daughter, Lavinia, died, leaving four young daughters, and Lady Lyttelton resigned her appointment in the following month. She returned to Hagley, where, after 1857, she transferred her talents to the education of the twelve motherless children of her eldest son: one of them recalled her as &#145;a stately, benevolent figure full of kindness and dignified humour, and of steadfast old-fashioned piety&#146;  (Lyttelton, 10). It was at Hagley that Lady Lyttelton died, on 13 April 1870, and she was buried there in the family vault.<br>
