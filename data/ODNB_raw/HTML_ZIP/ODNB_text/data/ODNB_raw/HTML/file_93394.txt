<span class="headword">Jonathan,  Leabua Joseph</span>  (1914&#150;1987), <span class="occ">prime minister of Basutoland and of Lesotho</span>, was born on 30 October 1914 at Leribe, Basutoland. A great-grandson of Moshoeshoe, founder of the Basotho kingdom, he was the fourth child of Chief Jonathan Molapo (1843/4&#150;1928) and his wife, M'akatiso. Because his father married over fifty wives, Leabua stood to inherit little from his father. After education at mission schools he found employment at a South African gold mine as a clerk in a mine compound, a position usually reserved for chiefs' sons. Returning home, he served in low-level positions in the chief's courts. In 1951 he was selected as assessor for the judicial commissioner, Patrick Duncan. In 1956 he was appointed to the Basutoland national council and served as an adviser to the regent, 'Mantsebo.<br>
<br>Chief Jonathan became involved in national politics because he was alarmed at what he perceived as the radical anti-white and anti-chief rhetoric of the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) and its leader, Ntsu Mokhehle. In 1958 he joined other conservative politicians in founding the Basutoland National Party, later the Basotho National Party (BNP), which received strong support from junior chiefs and the anti-communist hierarchy of the Catholic church. (Jonathan was himself a devout Catholic.) That same year he participated in a Basotho delegation to London to press the British government for more political and constitutional reforms for Basutoland; and he later took part in the delegation for the final constitutional talks with British officials that led to independence. In the first national election, held on 29 April 1965, the BNP narrowly won, taking thirty-one of sixty seats. Although Jonathan lost the seat he was contesting, his party formed a caretaker government under Chief Sekhonyana Maseribane until Jonathan won a by-election in a safe constituency. Once he joined the national assembly he took over the prime ministership from Maseribane and shepherded through the motion for his nation's independence, which the British granted on 4 October 1966. He then became the kingdom of Lesotho's first prime minister. He soon became embroiled in a dispute with King Moshoeshoe II, whom he accused of supporting his BCP rivals; in December 1966 he placed the king under house arrest, until the following month the king signed a document promising to keep out of politics.<br>
<br>Lesotho's relationship with South Africa shaped Jonathan's policies for the next two decades. A pragmatist, he sought dialogue and co-operation with South Africa, while his rival Mokhehle condemned South Africa's apartheid system. After Jonathan met South Africa's prime minister, John Vorster, in February 1967, South Africa agreed to loan white staff to Lesotho's civil service and police, and to donate surplus grain. Lesotho held its first post-independence election on 27 January 1970. As the returns came in, it was apparent that the opposition BCP was going to win a majority of seats in the national assembly. Jonathan was prepared to hand over power to Mokhehle, but changed his mind after listening to his counsellors and South African advisers. Citing reports of election irregularities and violence and intimidation at polling stations, he declared a state of emergency, suspended the constitution, and arrested BCP leaders, including Mokhehle. Although Jonathan's decision prompted Britain's Labour government to withdraw recognition of his government and suspend donor assistance, the British government shifted its stance after the Conservative Party won a general election in mid-1970. The coup also caused a second breach with King Moshoeshoe; Jonathan forced the king into exile in the Netherlands for eight months, until the king again signed a document promising to refrain from political activity. Because he had usurped power, Jonathan recognized that he had a problem of legitimacy both within Lesotho and internationally. He negotiated with the jailed Mokhehle to come to an understanding for an all-party government. In 1973 an interim national assembly was established, and after Mokhehle and his deputy Ramoreboli split and Mokhehle went into exile, Jonathan invited Ramoreboli to join his cabinet. Nevertheless there was no further general election in Lesotho until 1993.<br>
<br>Jonathan's boldest move was reversing his stance toward South Africa and becoming an outspoken opponent of the apartheid system. In 1972 he denounced South Africa at a session of the United Nations general assembly. After one of South Africa's homelands, Transkei, nominally became independent in 1976, Jonathan's government introduced a motion in the UN condemning Transkei's independence. This paid dividends when the Transkei government retaliated by closing Lesotho's eastern border and blocking goods from entering that part of Lesotho, and Lesotho received increased donor assistance from Canada, the United States, Norway, and Sweden. Jonathan also co-operated with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading resistance movement in South Africa. His decision to make Lesotho a haven for ANC members angered the South African government. Once the BCP formed an armed guerrilla wing, the Lesotho Liberation Army, to challenge Jonathan's regime, the South African government destabilized Lesotho by providing material assistance to the Lesotho Liberation Army and allowing it to operate from South Africa.<br>
<br>On 20 August 1980 Jonathan held a meeting with the South African prime minister, P. W. Botha, on the Lesotho&#150;South African border. Botha's objective was to isolate the ANC regionally, but Jonathan refused to hand over or expel ANC refugees and sign a non-aggression pact. The South African government responded by intensifying economic pressures on Lesotho and, on 9 December 1982, launching a military raid on Lesotho's capital, Maseru, killing forty-two people, mostly Lesotho civilians or citizens. Jonathan also generated controversy by developing Lesotho's ties with socialist countries. Lesotho established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1979 and with the Soviet Union in the following year. Jonathan's government then broke relations with Taiwan, and allowed China and North Korea to open embassies in Lesotho in 1983. Jonathan's policies lost him the support of Lesotho's Catholic church as well as infuriating the South African government.<br>
<br>Jonathan's rule collapsed because of an internal rivalry between Lesotho's military and a paramilitary force of the BNP's youth league. After South Africa raided Maseru again in December 1985, and imposed a border blockade on Lesotho on 1 January 1986, the rivalry came to a head. Resenting its marginalization, Lesotho's military overthrew Jonathan on 20 January. After successfully challenging an order placing him under house arrest, Jonathan resided at his farm at Rakolo. Suffering from stomach cancer, he died at the Little Company of Mary Hospital, Pretoria, on 6 April 1987. He was buried on the family farm at Kolonyma Ha Rakolo, Lesotho, on 20 April. He was survived by his wife, Manthli, daughter of Mutlanyane, and four daughters.<br>
