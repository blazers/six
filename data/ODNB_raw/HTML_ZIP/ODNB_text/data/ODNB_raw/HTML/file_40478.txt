<span class="headword">Nesbitt,  Cathleen</span>  (1888&#150;1982), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 24 November 1888 at 1 Liscard Grove, Liscard, Cheshire, the eldest of the five children of Thomas Nesbitt and his wife, Mary Catherine Parry. Thomas Nesbitt was a young naval lieutenant who subsequently became the captain of a tramp steamer, the <i>County Antrim</i>, owned by the County Shipping Line, of Belfast. At that point, when Cathleen was seven or eight years old, the Nesbitts moved to Belfast.<br>
<br>Cathleen was educated at Victoria College, Belfast. The family's financial circumstances were very narrow and her schooldays were scarred by privation. Later this situation eased somewhat and the family moved once again, this time to London. About this time Cathleen spent a year at a school in Lisieux, France. The move to London had been prompted partly by her mother's desire to live there and partly by Cathleen's growing interest in the theatre. She had been bewitched by it ever since she had been taken, at the age of eight, to see Sarah Bernhardt in <span class="italic">La dame aux cam&eacute;lias</span> at the Belfast theatre. Settled in London in 1907 she became a pupil of the actress Rosina Filippi, who in addition to playing regularly in the London theatres also gave lessons in acting to young aspiring professional performers. Cathleen Nesbitt proved an apt recruit; almost immediately after completing her training she made her first professional London appearance at the Royalty Theatre in 1910 in a play now long forgotten, <span class="italic">The Master of Mrs. Chilvers</span>. When this closed she at once secured a place in W. B. Yeats's Irish Players, in Dublin, and with them went to New York, causing something of a sensation there for her playing of Molly Byrne (the part originally played five years before by Sara Allgood) in J. M. Synge's <span class="italic">The Well of the Saints</span>.<br>
<br>Back in London in 1912 Cathleen Nesbitt was cast as Perdita in Granville Barker's famous and innovative production of <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> at the Savoy Theatre; she had originally been cast as Mopsa&#151;one of the two comic servants&#151;but was promoted during the course of rehearsals to the much more important part. Several contemporary critics refer not only to the sense of freshness and innocence that she conveyed in this role but also to her extreme physical beauty, though she herself, in her autobiography, complains constantly of having been &#145;too fat&#146; and describes her shape at that time as being roughly equivalent to that of a pillar box. Be that as it may it was her playing of Perdita that first attracted the attention of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32093/', "Rupert Brooke")</script>, who was so smitten by her that he went back to see the play twice more, in spite of the fact that he had an irrational and rooted prejudice against women on the stage. &#145;I'd better state before going further&#146;, he said to her in a letter of 1913, &#145;that as a matter of fact I loathe women acting in public&#146;  (Jones, 372); and in a later letter he added &#145;I hope you'll be giving up this beastly stage business soon&#146;  (ibid., 394). But in spite of the wild infatuation that she (along with others, both men and women) felt for Brooke she was not about to give it up &#145;soon&#146;&#151;or indeed ever: she played her last part in 1980, at the age of ninety-two.<br>
<br>There can be little doubt that Cathleen Nesbitt was deeply and genuinely in love with Brooke, as&#151;in his way&#151;he was with her. During 1912 and 1913 they saw a great deal of each other. But her early years of hazard and penury had given her a gritty personality and a staunchly realistic outlook on life: she was not easily fooled. In spite of the perfervid tone of the sonnets and poems that Brooke addressed to her (&#145;Cathleen! Loveliest creature! Nymph divine! / Unhoped for, unapproachable, yet mine!&#146;) she measured him shrewdly. Long after his death she recalled:<blockquote>Like all artists who have a neurotic strain he would always have needed another woman &hellip; I felt if I were married to him I would probably suffer a great deal, because I thought there was no chance of his ever being a one woman man. (Jones, 367)</blockquote>So she continued with her career, play after play. And, from 1922 onward, film after film&#151;thirty-seven of them between 1922 and 1975&#151;and dozens of television plays.In 1920 Cathleen Nesbitt was invited by Charles Morgan, at that time president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, to play Cleopatra in the Shakespeare <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>. Cecil Ramage, president of the Oxford Union, was Antony. &#145;On the last night there was a farewell party and we danced together continually&#146;  (Nesbitt, 146). Sentiments from the play seem to have slopped over into off-stage life (&#145;Let's have one other gaudy night&#146;); at the end of the dance he proposed marriage to her and was accepted. They married&#151;unhappily as it turned out&#151;in 1921. They had two children: Mark, born in 1922, and Jennifer, born in 1925.<br>
<br>Cathleen Nesbitt was equally at home in plays of fluff and frivolity and in sterner plays of greater consequence. Among the latter may be noted her roles in G. K. Chesterton's <span class="italic">The Man who was Thursday</span> (New York, 1916), <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (London, 1919), John Webster's <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span> (London, 1920), and Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> (London, 1921). She also appeared in more modern plays&#151;as Jennifer Dubedat in Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> (London, 1923), in Flecker's <span class="italic">Hassan</span> (London, 1923), and as Jessica in Granville Barker's <span class="italic">The Madras House</span> (London, 1926). In later life she continued to appear on stage, with roles in two of T. S. Eliot's plays: <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span> (Edinburgh, 1949) and <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span> (Guildford, 1964), in which she took the part of Amy. She also played in Enid Bagnold's <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span> (on tour in the USA in 1957) and in a version of Henry James's <span class="italic">The Aspern Papers</span> (Chichester, 1978). Among those confections of the lighter sort perhaps the most notable is her playing&#151;aged over ninety but looking about sixty&#151;of Mrs Higgins in <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span>, on tour in America in 1980. Equally sought after in England and in the United States she crossed the Atlantic many times as offers of parts reached her sometimes in one country, sometimes in the other.<br>
<br>It would be false to describe Cathleen Nesbitt as a great actress: she was never that. However, she was a steady, sturdy professional: meticulous, reliable, and infinitely capable. Her professional career was astonishingly continuous: in a profession notorious for its hazards and sudden vicissitudes she was never out of work for more than a month or so in a career spanning seventy years. In 1975 she published her autobiography, <span class="italic">A Little Love and Good Company</span> (the title is from George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>)&#151;a pleasant, chatty, sentimental, quite undistinguished piece of work containing a plethora of conventional commendatory adjectives of a very clich&eacute;d kind and the names of many well-known actors and actresses of the twentieth century in both England and America. She was appointed CBE in 1977, and died in London on 2 August 1982.<br>
