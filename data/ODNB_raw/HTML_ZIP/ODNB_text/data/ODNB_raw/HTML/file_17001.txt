<span class="headword">Lonsdale,  John</span>  (1788&#150;1867), <span class="occ">bishop of Lichfield</span>, born on 17 January 1788 at Newmillerdam, near Wakefield, Yorkshire, was the eldest son of John Lonsdale (1737&#150;1807), vicar of Darfield and perpetual curate of Chapelthorpe, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Steer (1750&#150;1827). His education commenced under the Revd Robert Wilkinson at the grammar school in Heath, near Halifax, and continued at Eton College from 1799, where Joseph Goodall pronounced him the best Latin scholar he had ever had. In 1806 he went up to King's College, Cambridge, where he twice won the Browne medal for a Latin ode, and was said to have penned the best Latin since the Augustan age in winning a university scholarship in 1809. In the same year he became a fellow of King's, taking his BA in 1811. Lonsdale commenced at Lincoln's Inn in 1811, but returned to King's in 1814 as a tutor. In 1815 he was ordained deacon and then priest within a month, relinquishing his fellowship on his marriage (25 November 1815) to Sophia (<i>d</i>. 16 Oct 1852), daughter of John Bolland MP, a London hop merchant. They had five children.<br>
<br>Shortly after his ordination Lonsdale was appointed chaplain to Archbishop Manners-Sutton (remaining in post when Howley succeeded), and the master of the Temple, Dean Rennell, advanced him to an assistant preachership. In 1822 Lonsdale became Christian advocate at Cambridge, succeeding Rennell's son, Thomas, of whom Lonsdale published a memoir in 1824. He soon resigned, however, when the archbishop appointed him rector of Mersham, Kent. From 1827 the same patron advanced him in succession to a prebendal stall at Lincoln, the precentorship at Lichfield (1828), and a prebend at St Paul's (1831). In 1828 Lord Lyndhurst made him rector of St George's, Bloomsbury, where he remained until he removed to Regent's Park in 1834, holding no cure before becoming preacher of Lincoln's Inn (1836&#150;43) and rector of Southfleet, near Gravesend (1836&#150;42). Throughout these years Lonsdale was a prominent figure in London religious life, being an active member of the National Society, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and the Incorporated Church Building Society. He served on the provisional committee and then on the council of King's College, London; in 1830 he declined to become the first principal. In January 1839, however, he took the post, having assumed its responsibilities during the illness of Hugh James Rose the previous year. As principal he secured the position of the medical school, and after resigning in 1843 he remained a council member until his death. Lonsdale also maintained a lifelong interest in Eton. In 1840 he was elected provost, only to decline in favour of Francis Hodgson, the crown nominee, whom the fellows had refused since he did not possess a BD (which Lonsdale, himself a fellow in 1827&#150;8, acquired in 1824). In January 1843 Blomfield appointed Lonsdale archdeacon of Middlesex, and in October Peel made him bishop of Lichfield, Howley having recommended him as possessing &#145;perfection of temper, and extraordinary fairness of mind&#146;.<br>
<br>Lonsdale was widely acknowledged as an outstanding bishop, distinguished by his unswerving attention to diocesan duty and his lack of partisanship. He rarely ventured onto the national stage in print or in person&#151;Howley judged him &#145;too thin-skinned&#146;&#151;and the only major publication of his later career was <span class="italic">The Four Gospels with Annotations</span> (1849) (prepared with W. H. Hale), which like his sermons concentrated on a clear exposition of fundamental doctrines. In 1847 he chaired the royal commission on Lord Lyndhurst's act prohibiting marriage with a deceased wife's sister, but despite condemning the act was not present to vote for its repeal. He was briefly chair of the Cambridge University commission in 1857. When he did speak out, Lonsdale was a voice of moderation, warning convocation against extreme resolutions against Bishop Colenso, and protesting against the decision of the council of King's College to ask F. D. Maurice to resign his professorship in 1853.<br>
<br>Lonsdale consecrated 156 new churches in his diocese; he himself contributed &pound;3,700 to this work. His personal wealth, drawn partly from profits obtained through improvements to an estate leased on Sunk Island at the mouth of the Humber, enabled him to become a net contributor to his see. Lonsdale also fostered the corporate life of the diocese, encouraging the meeting of ruridecanal chapters, lodging ordinands at the episcopal palace, and reserving his patronage exclusively for its clergy. At the time of his death he was contemplating summoning a diocesan conference. His most controversial innovation came when, despite considerable evangelical opposition, he supported the establishment of a diocesan theological college, opened in 1857. Lonsdale died suddenly from the rupture of a blood vessel on the brain on 19 October 1867 at Eccleshall Castle. He was buried at Eccleshall.<br>
<br>Tall and thin but broad shouldered, Lonsdale was fond of shooting, fishing, and the theatre, regretting that public opinion frowned on this last enthusiasm in a clergyman. His theology was that of &#145;the <i>old</i> high church school &hellip; but broadened by experience&#146;  (Denison, 240). He had little sympathy with ritualism, but in private preferred Tractarians to evangelicals, since they more generally conformed with his vision of a gentleman clergy.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17001"></a><span class="headword">James Gylby Lonsdale</span>  (1816&#150;1892), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, the bishop's eldest son, was born at the Clapham home of his grandfather, John Bolland, on 14 October 1816. He was educated at a Kensington school, then at Laleham School under the Revd J. Buckland (brother-in-law of Thomas Arnold), and from 1828 at Eton College, where in March 1834 he won the Newcastle scholarship. In 1833 he was elected open scholar of Balliol College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1837 with a first in classics and a second in mathematics, and proceeding MA in 1840. He became fellow of Balliol in 1838, counting among his friends Benjamin Jowett and A. P. Stanley, and was a tutor from 1841 to 1842.<br>
<br>In June 1842 Lonsdale took holy orders. It was about this time that he developed a liver complaint which forced him to leave Oxford (though he retained his fellowship until his marriage in 1864), and which afflicted him throughout the remainder of his life. Lonsdale accepted the post of chaplain to Bishop Tomkinson of Gibraltar, returning in 1843. He undertook cures at Malvern and Bowness, where he remained from 1844 to 1849. He then taught at the Royal Institution School in Liverpool, and in 1851 became a tutor at the University of Durham, serving as censor of University College and junior proctor (1852&#150;3). In 1853 he was appointed principal of Hatfield Hall, but resigned the following year as illness again took its toll. In 1854 he was encouraged to offer himself for election to the mastership at Balliol, but instead turned to parochial work as a curate at Duddon, Cheshire, and then at Holt, Worcestershire. After brief spells at Whitchurch grammar school and as assistant preacher at Lincoln's Inn, in 1863 Lonsdale was appointed professor of classical literature at King's College, London. In the following year he married Amelia Mary Peake. In 1870 he retired to the Balliol living of South Luffenham, Rutland, and in 1873 became rector of Huntspill, Somerset, where he remained until 1878. During these years, with his friend Samuel Lee, he produced his major publications&#151;prose translations of Virgil (1871) and of Horace (1873), the former going through twelve editions. After leaving Huntspill he moved to Mayfield, Sussex, and finally to Weybridge in 1885. He died of a chill at 6 Queen's Parade, Bath, on 25 April 1892, and was buried in Bath.<br>
<br>The testimonials Lonsdale received for King's College in 1862 bear witness to the high regard in which he was held, both as a scholar and as a teacher whose &#145;presence and manner act like a spell in enlivening dullness&#146;  (H. Montagu Butler). In person he was melancholic and retiring, but with a winning, boyish sense of humour. Conservative in his politics, he was a high-churchman with little time for ritualism (although he fraternized with nuns at Mayfield), favouring a practical piety: as he observed in one of his sermons, &#145;Of theology we can have too much; of true religion we cannot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 188).<br>
