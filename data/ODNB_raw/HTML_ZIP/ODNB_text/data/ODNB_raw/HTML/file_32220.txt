<span class="headword">Butlin, Sir  Henry Trentham</span>, first baronet  (1845&#150;1912), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the fourth son of the Revd William Wright Butlin (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1813, <i>d</i>. 1902), vicar of Penponds, Cornwall, and his wife, Julia Crowther Trentham, was born at Camborne, Cornwall, on 24 October 1845. He was educated at home until, at the age of nineteen, he went to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, to study medicine, having decided, like his paternal grandfather, to enter the medical profession. After qualifying (1867), he became house surgeon to James Paget. On 27 September 1873 he married Annie Tipping, daughter of Henry Balderson, merchant, of Hemel Hempstead.<br>
<br>After holding several junior posts, Butlin was elected an assistant surgeon to the hospital in 1881, full surgeon in 1892, and in 1897 a lecturer in surgery at the hospital school. For twelve years he had charge of the throat department, and played a great part in its development.<br>
<br>Besides service to St Bartholomew's and its school, Butlin was the first dean of the faculty of medicine of the University of London. He was also successively councillor, treasurer, and president (1910) of the British Medical Association, and councillor and president (1909&#150;11) of the Royal College of Surgeons, but was forced by failing health to resign that office shortly before his death. He was Erasmus Wilson professor of pathology, and later professor of pathology and surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons. The University of Durham conferred on him the honorary degree of DCL, and that of Birmingham, an honorary LLD. He was created a baronet in 1911.<br>
<br>Butlin was an energetic and successful man whose qualities were rewarded by the highest appointments in his profession and a large medical practice. He wrote a large number of papers, addresses, and monographs, dealing for the most part with the pathology of carcinoma and sarcoma, particularly of the larynx and tongue; among others, he wrote a well-known book on <span class="italic">Diseases of the Tongue</span> (1885). He was an excellent lecturer and teacher.<br>
<br>Butlin was a man of cultured taste, had a keen appreciation of art, was a good linguist, and liked to spend his holidays in travel in France, Spain, or Italy. Riding and driving were among his favourite recreations. He died at his home, 82 Harley Street, London, on 24 January 1912, leaving his wife, two daughters, and a son, who succeeded his father as second baronet; he joined the army while an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was killed in action in 1916.<br>
