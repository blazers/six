<span class="headword">Finch,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1704), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Standish, Lancashire, where he was baptized on 8 September 1633. The son of Peter Finch and his wife Katherine, he was educated at the grammar schools of Standish and Wigan. It is possible that he matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, in November 1650; but he was admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, in October of the following year and graduated BA in 1652.<br>
<br>Finch subsequently preached in the Fylde country of Lancashire. A member of the fifth presbyterian classis of Lancashire, he is known to have refused the engagement. He was presented to the vicarage of Walton on the Hill, Lancashire, on 25 November 1657 by Robert Eaton. In 1659 he took an active part in the royalist rising under Sir George Booth. His property was seized by the parliamentary sequestrators and not restored. In the same year, on 11 October, Finch married Mary Hammond of Warrington. Their three eldest children were baptized at Walton on the Hill: Mary (1660), <a href="#cosubject_9440">Peter (1661) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Tabitha (1662).<br>
<br>Finch was ejected from his living by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662, his successor at Walton being instituted on 29 January 1663. He retired to Warrington and lived with some of his wife's relations. The <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> (1665) compelled him to leave and he took up residence in Manchester, where he supported himself by keeping a school. There his four younger children were baptized: Nathan (1665), Hannah (1667), Elizabeth (1670), and James (1672). At both Warrington and Manchester he attended the ordinary services of the established church, preaching only occasionally on Sunday evenings in his own dwelling to such restricted gatherings as the law allowed. With the passing of the indulgence he was licensed a presbyterian on 30 April 1672, as of Manchester. He began ministering at Birch chapel, in the parish of Manchester, which was licensed on the same date as a meeting-place for presbyterians and congregationalists. Although in the hands of Thomas Birch and treated as a &#145;private oratory&#146;, the chapel was legally the property of the Manchester collegiate church. On 29 October 1672 Finch took part in the first ordination conducted by the protestant dissenters in Lancashire, in the house of Robert Eaton in Deansgate, Manchester. In June 1683 the warden of the collegiate church managed to preach in Birch chapel but Finch was reported as preaching there again in July. He was imprisoned in Chester during Monmouth's rising in 1685.<br>
<br>With the passing of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> Finch attempted to license Birch chapel, along with his house, as a meeting-place for protestant dissenters at the Lancashire quarter sessions held at Manchester on 25 and 26 July 1689. The warden objected and the entry in the quarter sessions register was crossed out. The Common Fund survey of 1690&#150;92 summarized the none too promising situation for Finch:<blockquote>Att Birch Chappell, where in the former Liberty hee continued 11 years and conti is now there, the allowance in considerable, the charge of his horse will goe a great way in his allowance from the people, yet complains not.</blockquote>He remained in the chapel until the death of Thomas Birch the younger in 1697. Birch's son George had Finch removed and ceded the chapel to its legal owners, presenting a conforming minister in 1699. Finch then preached at licensed houses in Platt and Birch townships until his friends erected a meeting-house in Platt, which opened in the latter part of 1700. The opening discourse was preached by James Grimshaw, minister to the Lancaster protestant dissenters, who had married Finch's daughter Hannah.<br>
<br>Finch was a member of the Lancashire provincial meeting of united ministers (presbyterian and congregationalist), acting as moderator when the provincial met in Manchester on 4 August 1696 and on 13 August 1700. He provided corrections to Edmund Calamy's original 1702 <span class="italic">Account</span> of the ejected ministers, which were passed on to Calamy by James Grimshaw and acknowledged in Calamy's <span class="italic">Continuation</span> of 1727. Though a strong supporter of the revolution of 1688, Finch was &#145;a charitable contributor&#146; to the distressed nonjurors. He died on 13 November 1704 and was buried at the collegiate church, Manchester, three days later.<br>
<br>Henry Finch's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_9440"></a><span class="headword">Peter Finch</span>  (1661&#150;1754), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 6 October 1661 in Walton on the Hill parish. On 3 May 1678 he entered the nonconformist academy of Richard Frankland at Natland, Westmorland. He soon moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA on 16 July 1680. His first employment was as chaplain in the family of William Ashurst, a city presbyterian (afterwards knighted and a future lord mayor) whose family had strong links with Lancashire. In 1691 Finch was invited to become colleague at Norwich to Josiah Chorley; his first entry in the Presbyterian register of baptisms is dated 1 June 1692. He remained at his post for over sixty-two years, and outlived Edward Crane and Thomas Dixon the younger, both of whom had been designated as his successor. Himself a strict Calvinist, he contributed much, by his love of peace, to preserve concord when doctrinal differences threatened to divide his flock. From 1733 John Taylor, the Hebraist, was his colleague. Finch died on his ninety-third birthday on 6 October 1754 and was buried in the church of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich. His funeral sermon was preached by Taylor, who described him as one of the last of the 300 students educated by Frankland. A small portrait of him hangs in the vestry of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. His great-grandson, Peter, was mayor of Norwich in 1827.<br>
