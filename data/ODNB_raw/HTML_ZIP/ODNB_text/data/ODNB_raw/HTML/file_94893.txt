<span class="headword">McCrum,  Michael William</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">classicist, headmaster, and college head</span>, was born at 3 Ashburton Road, Alverstoke, Hampshire, on 23 May 1924, the third of the four sons of Captain Cecil Robert McCrum (1892&#150;1976), naval officer, and his wife, Ivy Hilda Constance (1891&#150;1990), daughter of William Nicholson, fruit farmer and sugar planter. He won scholarships from Horris Hill, Newbury, to Sherborne School in Dorset (1937&#150;42), where he was head of school and a member of the first fifteen, and from Sherborne to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Naval service delayed his arrival at Corpus until 1946. Having enlisted as an ordinary seaman, he was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in December 1943. He served on Arctic convoys and off Sicily in 1943, and subsequently in the Far East on the aircraft carrier HMS <i>Victorious</i>, which was subjected to kamikaze attacks in 1945. He observed VJ-day gratefully thereafter.<br>
<br>At Corpus (1946&#150;8) McCrum gained a double first in the classical tripos (with distinction in part two) and played rugby for the LX Club. In 1948 he was appointed assistant master at Rugby School, where he took charge of part of the classical sixth and found time to play rugby for Warwickshire. Lasting consequences of his time there were a love of teaching and his marriage on 6 September 1952 to Christine Mary Kathleen fforde, the 23-year-old daughter of the head master, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31104/', "Sir Arthur Frederic Brownlow fforde")</script> (whose entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> McCrum later wrote). They had three sons and a daughter, and the closeness of the bond between them was central to their official, as to their private, lives.<br>
<br>In 1950 McCrum returned as a fellow to Corpus with a view to becoming tutor, responsible for the admission and wellbeing of students. From 1951 to 1962 he was both tutor and director of classical studies. Appointed university lecturer (1952&#150;62), he dealt in detail with the Athenian constitution. In 1961 he and his Corpus colleague A. G. Woodhead published <span class="italic">Select Documents of the Principates of the Flavian Emperors, including the Year of Revolution, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 68&#150;96</span>. As tutor, he loomed large in the lives of undergraduates, taking a close interest in them and entertaining them with apparent relish. He urged Corpus to respond to problems identified by a university committee on which he sat and arising from the growing numbers of research students, for whom colleges made limited provision, and of academics holding university posts who had no college affiliation. In 1962 an attractive graduate campus was established at Leckhampton House and eleven new fellows were elected on a single day.<br>
<br>In 1962 McCrum was invited to become headmaster of Tonbridge School. He was immediately seen to be &#145;a vastly energetic headmaster&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tonbridgian</span>, 1963). Tall and upright, he was a commanding presence&#151;more of &#145;a personage than a person&#146; as Vikram Seth supposed, until he was invited to lunch  (<span class="italic">Two Lives</span>, 9). He had a formidable knowledge of boys and supported their activities tirelessly, but did not seek their good opinion. He doubled as housemaster of School House, recognition on his part that he still had school business to learn. He was remembered for his &#145;insatiable desire for constructive activity&#146; and for his readiness to submit &#145;practically everything&#146; to &#145;methodical scrutiny&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tonbridgian</span>, 1970). He stressed, and raised, academic standards, and modified curriculum and timetable. He made a point of tidiness and punctuality (a fetish, some thought, of the latter), but permitted informal clothes in the evenings, visits to the cinema, and pub meals for prefects. He abolished practices he thought outmoded, including fagging and beating by boys. A committed worshipper and regular preacher, but aware of the challenge of securing a response from boys, he modified services and required chapel attendance just once on Sundays. The cadet corps became voluntary. By 1967 <span class="italic">The Tonbridgian</span> was writing: &#145;Never have there been so many changes in so short a time.&#146; One view was that during his eight years as headmaster he had transformed &#145;a good public school in Kent [into] one of the top schools in the United Kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tonbridgian</span>, 1970). The process was variously remembered, some judging that a determined headmaster had imposed his views, others that he had wanted nothing so much as to engage the common room in collegial review.<br>
<br>McCrum was pressed to become head master of Eton College, where his predecessor's time had been cut short, in 1970. He quickly demonstrated &#145;exceptional ability to master issues and to make decisions&#146;  (Card, 268). He dealt firmly, but consistently, with matters of discipline, retaining his right to administer corporal punishment, which had brought criticism upon his predecessor. He made a sustained attempt to improve academic standards, and adjusted entry procedures to reduce what could be considered an academic tail. Aware that implementing changes at Eton would prove complex, he made effective use of its apparatus of committees, though he did not always succeed in disarming criticism or resistance. Beating by boys and personal fagging were abolished, and more relaxed dress was permitted out of school hours, as was occasional weekend leave for senior boys. McCrum visited in his turn questions about the Eton curriculum originally raised by the public schools commission in the 1860s, and modified arrangements in the lower school, reserving a prominent place for Latin and Greek, but dismantling classical divisions, in which English and divinity had also been taught, and making extended time available for artistic subjects. Senior boys were given a choice between weekday chapel services and assemblies intended to promote open enquiry. McCrum made time to serve as chairman of the Headmasters' Conference in 1974, and was particularly keen to open Eton to a wider world. He brought large numbers of visitors to the school (the McCrums viewed the end of an Eton half as the closing of their hotel). As at Tonbridge, he strongly supported community service, and introduced junior scholarships that brought boys from maintained primary schools, via preparatory schools, to Eton. In the opinion of one historian of Eton he had brought to &#145;the basic management of Eton &hellip; greater skill than any Head Master since Dr Warre in his prime&#146;  (Card, 283).<br>
<br>In 1980 McCrum returned to Corpus as master, and held that office until 1994. In 1982 he persuaded the college to admit women as students and fellows, and he admitted twice as many new fellows as any one of his predecessors. A building programme and appeal were launched to accommodate expanding numbers. He resumed an active part in the counsels of the university, and in 1987 became vice-chancellor, the last college head to take the two-year turn that had been customary. He stressed the importance of a measure of financial independence for the university, and the Cambridge Foundation was established in his time. In demand as a governor, he maintained his involvement with schools, and chaired both the Governing Bodies Association (1989&#150;94) and the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board (1981&#150;7). He also became the first chairman of the Cathedrals Fabric Commission (1991&#150;9), and in 1996 was appointed CBE for his work in that capacity, his contribution to education, curiously, going unremarked.<br>
<br>McCrum had run the institutions entrusted to him with conspicuous efficiency, but he had never been content merely to run them. Committed to them as places of learning, communities, and Christian foundations, he had taken up with enthusiasm the task of refitting them for changing, and challenging, times. Two late published works pointed to convictions and attitudes that had shaped a lifetime: <span class="italic">Thomas Arnold, Head Master: a Reassessment</span> (1989) and <span class="italic">The Man Jesus: Fact and Legend</span> (1999). He was tried late in life by Parkinson's disease and cancer of the prostate, but was determined not to be diminished by them. He died suddenly of cardiac arrest at his home, 32 Clarendon Street, Cambridge, on 16 February 2005. He was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew and St Mary at Grantchester, and was survived by his wife, Christine, and their four children.<br>
