<span class="headword">Colling,  Robert</span>  (1749&#150;1820), <span class="occ">stockbreeder</span>, was born in December 1749, the eldest son in the family of two sons and two or three daughters of Charles Colling (1721&#150;1785), farmer, of Ketton, near Darlington, and his wife, Dorothy Robson (<i>d</i>. 1779); his brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5925/', "Charles Colling")</script>. After receiving some education, he was apprenticed to a grocer in Shields, but because of poor health he came home to his father's farm and embarked on an agricultural career.<br>
<br>After spending some time at Hurworth, co. Durham, Colling took a farm nearby at Barmpton, under the Lambton family. At first he kept only dairy cows, and had no plans to breed shorthorns. The foundation of his pedigree herd was a yellow-red and white bull (known in shorthorn history as Hubback), originally bought on the advice of his brother Charles for 8 guineas, and afterwards sold to his brother for the Ketton herd. A &#145;shyness&#146; sprang up between the brothers, which became accentuated in March 1793, and the Barmpton and Ketton herds for some time lived apart, though later more amicable relations were restored. When in October 1810 Charles Colling sold off his Ketton herd of shorthorns, Robert's herd at Barmpton became the centre of interest to the breeders of shorthorns, which had then become fashionable.<br>
<br>A famous white heifer (daughter of the bull Favourite), which at four years old weighed 1820 lb, was painted by Thomas Weaver; an engraving of the picture was made by William Ward, and published on 13 December 1811, with a dedication to Robert Colling. The heifer was purchased by two butchers and exhibited at Christmas 1811 at the stables of the Three Kings, Piccadilly, as &#145;the greatest wonder of the world of the kind&#146;, and then weighed 2448 lb. &#145;The same system of in-and-in breeding that had been in vogue at Ketton was pursued without interruption at Barmpton, and that without any admixture of fresh alloy&#146;  (Bates, &#145;Brothers Colling&#146;, 22). Robert carried on his herd until Michaelmas day 1810, when it was sold by auction; sixty-one lots fetched &pound;7852 19<i>s</i>. Colling died unmarried at Barmpton on 7 March 1820, leaving his property to his brother Charles, and a final sale was held on 3 October 1820.<br>
<br>Colling was considered a model all-round farmer&#151;good cattle, good sheep, good crops, neat hedges, neat farm-buildings&#151;but, not being so much of a specialist, he was less known than his more businesslike and versatile brother, Charles.<br>
