<span class="headword">Blore,  Eric</span>  (1886&#150;1959), <span class="occ">actor and theatrical sketch writer</span>, was born on 23 December 1886 at Elm Park Road, Church End, Finchley, Middlesex, one of two children of Henry Blore (<i>d</i>. 1914), a schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Newton. After leaving school in Finchley, Blore began selling insurance, but in 1908 he went on the stage.<br>
<br>Although Blore became one of the most recognizable of film &#145;character actors&#146;&#151;usually as a (subversive) butler or valet&#151;his early theatrical career was more varied. After touring Australia with a concert party, in 1910 Blore won a role in an English touring version of the popular musical comedy <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span> and became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the variety comic G. P. Huntley. By 1913, the year of his West End performing d&eacute;but in the Empire revue <span class="italic">All the Winners</span>, Blore's sketches and short plays, rich in absurd situations and wordplay, were being produced in London. These included <span class="italic">Alice up to Date</span> at the Pavilion (1913) and <span class="italic">A Burlington Arcadian</span> at the Coliseum (1914).<br>
<br>After the rise of intimate revue, Blore formed a partnership with composer Philip (Pa) Braham, placing songs&#151;often flirtatious and faux-innocent&#151;in such shows as <span class="italic">The Bing Boys are Here</span> (1916). During the First World War, Blore, a lieutenant in the South Wales Borderers, ran a concert party called &#145;The Welsh Wails&#146;. He later said that his batman &#145;taught me the whole art&#146; of being a gentleman's gentleman: &#145;He had a way of putting out my studs that made them look worth at least 2 guineas&#146;  (private information). On 29 October 1917 Blore married Violet Lydia Victoria, daughter of George Winter; she died, childless, on 19 February 1919, a victim of the influenza epidemic of late 1918.<br>
<br>In 1920 Blore contributed sketches to the Andr&eacute; Charlot revue <span class="italic">Jumble Sale</span> and made his film d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">A Night Out and a Day In</span>. 1921 was the year of his collaboration with Inglis Allen and Austin Melford in creating the revue <span class="italic">Ring Up</span> for Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge; one of his wartime sketches, &#145;The Disorderly Room&#146; (all the dialogue is set to the tunes of popular songs) was taken up by the aspiring variety performer Tommy Handley, who played it for twenty years, in a royal variety performance in 1924 as well as on record, film, radio, and television. A Blore song with Braham, &#145;How d'you do?&#146;, opened <span class="italic">Charlot's London Revue</span> in New York (1924).<br>
<br>Blore's onstage acting career had begun with roles portraying farcical &#145;dudes&#146; with names such as Alsop Bibby and the Honourable H. Buff-Orpington. The second half of his career began in New York with another one, Bertie Bird, in <span class="italic">Little Miss Bluebeard</span> (1923). Bird was the first of a line of Blore's fops and clapped-out nobles on Broadway&#151;Reggies and Basils and Roddys&#151;stretching throughout the decade. Blore first played a butler in <span class="italic">Gentleman in Waiting</span> (1925). In 1926 he married the American actress Clara Macklin; they had one child and remained married until Blore's death. In the same year he was Lord Digby in the first film version of <span class="italic">The Great Gatsby</span>. After playing a waiter in Cole Porter's musical comedy <span class="italic">The Gay Divorce</span> on Broadway (1932) and in the West End (1933), Blore was summoned to RKO-Radio Pictures in Hollywood as Butterbass, a not quite head waiter who suffered seethingly under the prissy Franklin Pangborn, in <span class="italic">Flying Down to Rio</span> (1933), the first notable pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.<br>
<br>Four more Astaire&#150;Rogers films followed, including <span class="italic">Top Hat</span> (1935), in which Blore created a multi-dimensional valet (introducing himself to his bumbling employer, Edward Everett Horton, as &#145;We are Bates, sir&#146;, he spoke one of the era's most memorable lines). After these films Blore was rarely at liberty. Never billed higher than third, he appeared in more than eighty films, earning as much as $3500 (then &pound;750) per week. In <span class="italic">It's Love I'm after</span> (1937) he remarked, &#145;If I were not a gentleman's gentleman, I could be such a cad's cad.&#146; In Laurel and Hardy's <span class="italic">Swiss Miss</span> (1938) he endured a contretemps with a stingy St Bernard. In the English film <span class="italic">A Gentleman's Gentleman</span> (1939) he took up blackmailing.<br>
<br>Blore's valets were rarely obsequious. Eyebrows arched, face twitching, nostrils flaring, he could switch instantly from innocence or impishness through wounded dignity to (usually comic) menace. Blore also developed a useful sideline in seedy tropical expatriates (<span class="italic">The Island of Lost Men</span>, 1939, <span class="italic">South of Suez</span>, 1940).<br>
<br>In his later years in California, Blore retained his English persona, peppering conversation with &#145;Good chap&#146; and &#145;Don't y'know?&#146; In 1940 Blore revisited his revue past, joining other expatriates in the Hollywood run of <span class="italic">Andr&eacute; Charlot's War Relief Revue</span>. In 1944 Blore made a final Broadway appearance in a nostalgic revival of <span class="italic">The Ziegfeld Follies</span>. His was the manic voice of Toad in Disney's <span class="italic">The Wind in the Willows</span> (1949), a somehow fitting near-finale; early on, he had played an owl in a Liverpool panto. After a stroke in 1956 Blore retired from film. He died of a heart attack in the suburban Los Angeles Motion Picture Country Home Hospital on 1 March 1959; his ashes were inurned in the Chapel of the Pines, Forest Lawn.<br>
