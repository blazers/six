<span class="headword">Arthur,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1532/3), <span class="occ">religious radical</span>, is of uncertain origins, though he may have belonged to an Arthur family of Wisbech. He studied at Cambridge, graduating in 1513 and proceeding MA in 1516. In 1518 he became a fellow of St John's, and is recorded as principal of St Mary's hostel in the same year. He may perhaps be the Thomas Arthur who was rector of Glandford, Norfolk, in 1514. He was among the Cambridge men who in the 1520s became enthused by an eclectic mix of ideas about church reform, ideas whose sources included Erasmus, Luther, and the Lollards. He seems to have been among the first to fall under the spell of the charismatic evangelical Thomas Bilney, and Foxe expressly credits him and Bilney with the conversion to their views of two future martyrs, John Lambert and Robert Barnes.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1527 Arthur and Bilney preached in various churches in London and East Anglia, propounding justification by faith and attacking both images and the attribution to the saints of any mediatory or intercessory role. It is probable that the two men had been in trouble before, perhaps in the previous years, and may have been forbidden to preach. Arthur was particularly insistent that those who could preach should not, or could not, be inhibited from so doing by any episcopal, or indeed earthly, authority. He subsequently denied that he had exhorted a congregation to pray for those imprisoned for preaching &#145;the trew gospell of God&#146;  (Foxe, 4, appx, citing Tunstall reg. fol. 135<i>v</i>). As a result of their preaching Arthur and Bilney were summoned to appear before Cardinal Wolsey and a legatine commission of four other bishops to face investigation for heresy in late November 1527. Both men abjured in early December.<br>
<br>Almost nothing is known about Arthur following his abjuration. John Bale attributes five named works to him: two Latin tragedies, two religious works, and a translation of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>. However, no work by him is known to be extant. The English <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span> published by Wynkyn de Worde for John Byddell in 1533 may be his, but William Tyndale has an equal if not better claim to be considered the translator. It is alternatively possible that he was responsible for the translation of the work printed by William Seres in 1561 and edited by John Gough from an anonymous manuscript.<br>
<br>Bilney was burnt for heresy on 19 August 1531 in Norwich. Arthur survived him by little more than a year, dying in either December 1532 or January 1533 in Little Walsingham, site of England's premier Marian shrine and symbol of so much that he and Bilney had inveighed against. He asked to be buried in Little Walsingham churchyard. His religious views had probably not changed, however: despite consisting mostly of charitable bequests, his will has neither traditional formulas nor provision for traditional devotions. Chief among his named beneficiaries are the prisoners in Lynn, Norwich, and the Tower of London, and it is difficult not to suppose that he had in mind those victims of Thomas More and Richard Nix&#151;some of them his old Cambridge colleagues&#151;whose offence was preaching &#145;the trew gospell of God&#146;.<br>
