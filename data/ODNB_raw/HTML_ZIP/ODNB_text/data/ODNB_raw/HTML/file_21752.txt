<span class="headword">Pedder,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1571), <span class="occ">dean of Worcester</span>, was born in Suffolk and educated at Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1538, subsequently proceeding MA in 1542 and BTh in 1552. Having embraced protestantism, he went abroad on Queen Mary's accession in 1553. In 1554 he was at Strasbourg, and supported Grindal in his advocacy of the prayer book of the Church of England. But when, three years later, he was a member of the Frankfurt congregation, he took the side of the main body, the &#145;Knoxian&#146; or Calvinistic church members, in the disputes as to discipline.<br>
<br>On his return to England at Elizabeth's accession, Pedder became chaplain to Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper from 22 December 1558. In that position he was very influential in recommending candidates to Bacon for lesser crown patronage. On 27 December 1559 he was installed dean of Worcester, succeeding the Catholic Seth Holland, who was imprisoned. Pedder was already prebendary of the sixth stall at Norwich Cathedral and rector of Redgrave in Suffolk, positions he owed to Bacon. He resigned Redgrave on 24 February 1560. On 26 September 1561 he was collated to the vicarage of Snitterfield, Warwickshire, and on 15 May 1563 to a prebend at Hereford, which he retained until death. He resigned his Norwich prebend on 24 February. Cecil's memoranda show that Pedder was considered for appointment as a bishop, but he was never raised to the episcopacy.<br>
<br>Pedder attended the lower house of convocation in 1563 and subscribed the articles in February that year, although he also approved of and voted for the six articles propounding certain alterations in the rites and ceremonies (13 February 1563). In addition, he supported the twenty-one &#145;requests&#146; in which the lower house of convocation petitioned for changes in the articles, liturgy, and discipline.<br>
<br>Pedder's stipend as dean was &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. at a time when the cathedral's total receipts amounted to about &pound;1200 a year. During an investigation of abuses in 1587 the sexton, Henry Hymbleton, said that at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign the plate and jewels remaining at the cathedral were removed by Pedder and the then prebendaries &#145;and devided amongst them, but to what use they did employ the same&#146; he could not tell. &#145;And the Copes, Vestments, and suche ornamentes were converted, some of them to the making of Cushens, and to some suche other uses belonging to the Churche, and the rest thereof converted, he knoweth not to what uses&#146;  (articles of complaint concerning church estates, 1587, Worcester Cathedral Library, MS A.25).<br>
<br>Pedder died in 1571, between 7 April, when he drew up his will, and 4 May, when his successor was appointed, and was buried in the south transept of Worcester Cathedral, where a monument to his memory was later erected by Arthur Lake, dean of Worcester between 1608 and 1616. Its inscription recorded his exile under Mary and return under Elizabeth. His will shows him to have been a leaseholder of secular and ecclesiastical property on a modest scale in Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. His principal beneficiaries were his brother and sister; he also made bequests to the son and daughter of his (unnamed) deceased wife, in terms which show that she had been a widow when she married Pedder.<br>
