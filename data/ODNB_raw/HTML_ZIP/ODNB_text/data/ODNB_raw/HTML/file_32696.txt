<span class="headword">Dallinger,  William Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and biologist</span>, was born in Devonport on 5 July 1842, the son of Joseph Stephen Dallinger, artist, etcher, and engraver. He was educated privately and showed an early inclination towards natural history. His religious instinct led him to qualify for the Wesleyan ministry in 1861. After serving Wesleyan churches in Faversham, Cardiff, and Bristol, he passed to Liverpool, where he remained for twelve years (1868&#150;80). On 18 December 1866, while in Cardiff, he married Emma Jane (<i>b</i>. 1842), daughter of David Goldsmith, an ironmonger from Bury St Edmunds. The couple had one son.<br>
<br>In 1870, in Liverpool, Dallinger began microscopic researches, which he pursued for ten years, into minute septic organisms. In 1880 he was appointed governor and principal of Wesley College, Sheffield. After eight years, the Wesleyan conference, recognizing his scientific attainments, allowed him to retire from the position while retaining the status and privilege of a Wesleyan minister but without pastoral charge. In addition to his work as minister and governor, Dallinger was a successful public lecturer on microscopical subjects, and for thirty years he lectured for the Gilchrist Educational Trust.<br>
<br>Dallinger's contributions to science were of two kinds&#151;his classical investigations into the life history of certain micro-organisms, and his improvements in microscopical technique. In collaboration with John James Drysdale of Liverpool he concentrated his research on protozoa, in particular on flagellates, about which little was then known. In addition Dallinger and his colleague contributed valuable evidence regarding the then controversial question of abiogenesis (the apparent spontaneous generation of life). They were able to show that flagellates subjected to increasingly high temperatures could be forced to exist in temperatures ordinarily lethal to unacclimatized specimens. Further research showed that the spores of such organisms were also resistant to very high temperatures. These discoveries led to the realization that the ordinary precautions (such as boiling) by which organic solutions were sterilized were insufficient. More importantly, however, his contemporaries believed that these results explained the origin of life in experiments where spontaneous generation had been supposed to occur.<br>
<br>As an expert microscopist, Dallinger enjoyed the highest reputation. His earliest biological researches were rewarded by an unsought grant of &pound;100 from the Royal Society, and he was elected FRS in 1880. He occupied the post of president of the Royal Microscopical Society four times (1884&#150;7) and that of the Quekett Club (1890&#150;92). He was requested to present his principal results at the British Association meeting in Montreal in 1884, and while there he was awarded an honorary degree of LLD from Victoria University. In 1892, at the celebration of the tercentenary of Trinity College, Dublin, he received his DSc degree, and four years later Durham University created him a DCL in recognition of his contributions to science.<br>
<br>In 1879 Dallinger delivered the Rede lecture at Cambridge, &#145;The origin of life&#146;, which he illustrated with the life histories of simple organisms. His chief papers were published in the <span class="italic">Monthly Microscopical Journal</span> (1873&#150;6). He edited and rewrote William Benjamin Carpenter's book <span class="italic">The Microscope and its Revelations</span> (1890; new edn, 1901), and was author of a theologico-scientific work, <span class="italic">The Creator and what we may Know of the Method of Creation</span> (1887). He died at his home, Ingleside, New Stead Road, Lee, Kent, on 7 November 1909. He was survived by his wife.<br>
