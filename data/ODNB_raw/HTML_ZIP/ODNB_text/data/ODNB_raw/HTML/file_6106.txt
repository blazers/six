<span class="headword">Constable <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Lacey]</span>,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Clerophilus Alethes]</span>  (1676/1678&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Lincolnshire on 10 November 1676 or 1678. The names of his parents have not been found, but as he used the alias of Lacey that may have been his mother's family name; Lacy was also the name of a remote Constable ancestor. In 1690 he joined his elder brother, Joseph (or Marmaduke), at the English College at St Omer, and in 1695 followed him into the Society of Jesus. After his noviciate at Watten in Flanders and studies for the priesthood at Li&egrave;ge, he was ordained about 1704. From 1705 to 1711 he lectured in philosophy, scripture, and theology and taught Hebrew to the Jesuit students at Li&egrave;ge. After a few years on the staff of St Omer College and assisting in the training of Jesuit novices he crossed to England about 1723 and became chaplain to the Fitzherbert family at Swynnerton in Staffordshire.<br>
<br>During the years he was at Swynnerton Constable wrote several works that were published and others that remained in manuscript. He always wrote under the pseudonym Clerophilus Alethes. In Oliver's opinion, &#145;unquestionably F. Constable is entitled to rank amongst the ablest and best informed men in the English [Jesuit] province&#146;  (Oliver, 57). His first published work was <span class="italic">Remarks upon F. Le Courayer's Book in Defence of the English Ordinations &amp;c</span> (n.d.). This was an answer to Le Courayer's dissertation on the validity of Anglican orders and of the succession of the bishops of the Church of England published in Brussels in 1723. In 1726 Le Courayer published a defence of his dissertation, and Constable replied with <span class="italic">The stratagem discovered, or, An essay of an apology for F. Le Courayer's late work in 4 vols. entitled &#145;D&eacute;fense de la dissertation &amp;c&#146; wherein strong instances are produced to show that he writes &#145;booty&#146; and is only a sham defender of these ordinations, while he very much confirms the judgment of their invalidity</span> (1727).<br>
<br>On 16 July 1735 Constable was made rector of the Jesuit &#145;district&#146; of St Chad, the Jesuit priests working in Staffordshire. He continued to engage in controversy. Further publications included a justification of the antiquity of the eucharist and repudiations of deism and latitudinarianism. In 1741, in a vigorous reply to an attack on the Jesuits by Charles Dodd (H. Tootell), a Catholic priest who had published a three-volume history of the English church, he published <span class="italic">A specimen of amendments candidly proposed to the compiler of the work which he calls &#145;The church history of England from the year 1500 to the year 1688&#146;</span>. Dodd replied with <span class="italic">An Apology for the &#145;Church History of England&#146;</span> (1742), a work &#145;angry, coarse and abusive&#146;  (Oliver, 58). Constable's answer, &#145;Advice to the author of the <i>Church History of England</i>&#146;, was described as &#145;searching, smart and acute&#146;  (ibid.), but was never published because the author &#145;was not solicitous enough to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace&#146;  (ibid.). It remains in manuscript at Stonyhurst with other unpublished works.<br>
<br>Among Constable's other publications were <span class="italic">Reflections upon Accuracy of Style. In Five Dialogues</span> (1734) and <span class="italic">The Conversation of Gentlemen Considered. In Six Dialogues</span> (1738). He died at Swynnerton, Staffordshire, on 27 March 1743, and was buried the next day in the parish church.<br>
