<span class="headword">Rowntree,  John Wilhelm</span>  (1868&#150;1905), <span class="occ">chocolate manufacturer and religious activist</span>, was born on 4 September 1868 at Top House, St Mary's, York, the eldest of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35857/', "Joseph Rowntree (1836&#150;1925)")</script> and his second wife, (Emma) Antoinette (1846&#150;1924), daughter of Wilhelm Seebohm of Hamburg. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35856/', "(Benjamin) Seebohm Rowntree")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Bootham School, York, and Oliver's Mount School, Scarborough. In 1886 he entered his father's York cocoa works at Tanner's Moat, working in each department so as to become &#145;thoroughly acquainted with the <i>practical</i> side of the work&#146;  (Vernon, 88). At nineteen he reorganized the cocoa and chocolate departments; at twenty-one he became a partner and, on the firm becoming a limited company in 1897, a director, serving until his death. While not warming to business life he took a full and effective share in it, including the planning of the move in the 1890s to the Haxby Road site. He saw the firm grow from 200 employees to over 2000.<br>
<br>Rowntree was tall and erect in bearing, had a ready wit, and was an excellent mimic. He inherited from his mother an interest in the arts: he had some talent for painting and became passionately interested in the theatre, becoming himself a gifted amateur actor. He married on 28 July 1892 Constance Margaret Naish (1871&#150;1928): they had five children.<br>
<br>At the 1893 yearly meeting of British Quakers Rowntree spoke for younger friends not reached by the language of evangelical orthodoxy. With his creative driving force he became an acknowledged leader among those urging Friends to come to terms with scientific discoveries, biblical criticism, and the social implications of the gospel. To this end he took a notable part in the Manchester conference (1895) and in the promotion from 1897 of summer schools, leading to the foundation in 1903 of Woodbrooke, Birmingham, as a permanent centre for these studies. In 1897 he met in Switzerland the American Quaker Rufus M. Jones (1863&#150;1948): together they planned a comprehensive history of Quakerism, written after Rowntree's death by Jones and William Charles Braithwaite (1862&#150;1922). Rowntree also founded and edited (1899&#150;1902) <span class="italic">Present Day Papers</span> as a vehicle of Christocentric faith freed from doctrinal narrowness: some of the society's practices he dismissed as &#145;Quaker caution and love of detail run to seed&#146;  (Vernon, 106).<br>
<br>Like his father, Rowntree was devoted to adult school work and his students found his teaching lucid and arresting but demanding. With Henry Bryan Binns (1873&#150;1923) he wrote <span class="italic">A History of the Adult School Movement</span> (1903; reprinted with new introduction and notes, 1985). He was impatient with the &#145;brief and bright&#146; approach of the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon movement. He was equally impatient with mission-minded Quakers who wished to brighten meetings for worship with congregational singing and he stressed the need for an educated lay ministry: his own gift in the vocal ministry was acknowledged by York monthly meeting in 1900.<br>
<br>Rowntree had been a delicate child and had early suffered from deafness (an ear trumpet had to be bought when he was only nine). In 1894 he had serious contraction of sight, diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa, and was warned of coming and irreparable blindness. The ensuing decade of intense activity could have been, but was not, clouded by his health, despite almost daily bouts of depression. He was the only one of Joseph's children who could make his father laugh. In 1899 his doctors ordered a country life and Rowntree retired to Scalby, near Scarborough. In 1905 he sailed for his fourth visit to his American eye specialist, but contracted pneumonia on the voyage and died in a New York hospital on 9 March, his body being interred on 17 March in Friends' burial-ground, Haverford, Pennsylvania.<br>
