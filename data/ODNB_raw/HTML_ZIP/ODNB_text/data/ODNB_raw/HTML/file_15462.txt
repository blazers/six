<span class="headword">Ker <span class="st"> [Kerr]</span>,  Mark</span>, first earl of Lothian  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1559, <em>d.</em> 1609), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the oldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15461/', "Mark Ker (1517&#150;1584)")</script>, commendator of Newbattle, and Lady Helen (<i>d</i>. 1594), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16488/', "George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes")</script>. He was born before 20 February 1559, when his father, then technically a cleric, granted a charter of Newbattle Abbey land to him and his mother. His parents married some time soon after 1560. During his lifetime the Newbattle property was steadily transformed into a secular lordship in his favour. On 7 April 1567 Queen Mary made him a grant of the commendatorship for life, to be implemented on the death or demission of his father. In 1581 his father demitted the office in his favour, keeping the liferent, both their names appearing thereafter in charters of abbey land. This transaction was the equivalent of the way in which a secular landowner's son might become <i>fear</i> (recognized heir) during his father's lifetime. On 21 August 1584, only two days after his father's death, Mark younger had a ratification from James VI of the 1567 grant. On 28 July 1587 he had a charter from the king granting him and his heirs all the lands belonging to the former abbacy of Newbattle, and on 15 October 1591 he was created Lord Newbattle, all the abbey territories being united into one lordship.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1606 Ker was created earl of Lothian. Concurrently with the transformation of the Newbattle Abbey title and lands into a secular lordship, the monastic buildings were gradually replaced by a private dwelling, of which Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit wrote:<blockquote>And the father and son did so metamorphose the buildings that it cannot be known that ever it did belong to the church, by reason of the fair new fabric and stately edifices built thereon &hellip; instead of the old monks has succeeded the deer. (J. Scott, <span class="italic">The Staggering State of Scottish Statesmen</span>, 1754)</blockquote>Mark Ker followed a career in royal and public service. In 1580, as Mr Mark Ker of Prestongrange, he was made a gentleman of the chamber to James VI. In 1577 he was made master of requests, the appointment being confirmed in 1581. On 18 December 1581 he appears in the privy council record under that title, and thereafter attended many meetings of the council and served on many of its committees. On 8 December 1598 he was among those councillors chosen to sit at Holyroodhouse on Tuesdays and Thursdays to assist the king in the dispatch of business. In September 1599 he was appointed collector of a tax of 200,000 merks levied for certain foreign embassies. In the legal field, he was appointed to succeed his father as an extraordinary lord of session (judge) on 12 November 1584, and in January 1597 he had confirmation of the office of justiciary in the regality of Stow, sold to him by Lord Borthwick. On 28 July 1600 he was commanded to reside at his castle of Neidpath, near Peebles, in order to apply effectively the act of 1567 for the pursuit of thieves. On 19 September 1604 he was made acting chancellor during the absence of the earl of Montrose, then a commissioner in England at the discussions on the proposed Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union. He was also involved in church affairs. In January 1606 he was one of the assessors chosen at Linlithgow for the trial for treason of ministers opposed to the king's ecclesiastical policy, who were imprisoned in Blackness Castle.<br>
<br>Earlier, Ker and other judges had refused to be influenced by the king's attempts to force the court of session to come to an adverse decision against Robert Bruce, minister at Edinburgh, with regard to Bruce's claim to a life pension from the revenues of the abbacy of Arbroath. In 1608 he acted as assessor to the earl of Dunbar, the king's commissioner to the general assembly of the church, and in February 1609 he was on a commission to advise the king on how to bring &#145;peace and religion&#146; to the isles  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, <i>1607&#150;10</i>, 742).<br>
<br>On being created earl of Lothian, Ker resigned his office of master of requests to his oldest son Robert. Some time before 29 March 1587 he had married Margaret, second daughter of John Maxwell, fourth Lord Herries of Terregles, and Agnes, baroness of Terregles in her own right; she died at Prestongrange on 8 January 1617. Their children were Robert, who became second earl of Lothian, Sir William Ker of Blackhope (who unsuccessfully claimed the title on his elder brother's death in 1624), James, John, Jean (who married, first, Robert, master of Boyd, second, David Lindsay, twelfth earl of Crawford, and third, Thomas Hamilton of Roberton), Janet (who married William Cunningham, seventh earl of Glencairn), Margaret (who founded Lady Yester's Church in Edinburgh and married, first, James, seventh Lord Hay of Yester, second, Sir Andrew Ker, master of Jedburgh), Isobel (who married William Douglas, first earl of Queensberry), Lilias (who married John, ninth Lord Borthwick), Mary (who married Sir James Richardson of Smeaton), and Elizabeth (who married Sir Alexander Hamilton of Innerwick). The earl himself died on 8 April 1609, having made his will at Newbattle on 1 March 1602 when he was about to leave on a journey through England and France. He left an estate valued at nearly &pound;37,000 Scots.<br>
