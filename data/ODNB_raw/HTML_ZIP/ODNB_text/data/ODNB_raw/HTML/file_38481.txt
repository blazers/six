<span class="headword">Prosser,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1747, <em>d.</em> 1839), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and tutor</span>, was baptized on 26 July 1747 at Market Drayton, Shropshire, the third son and fourth child of Humphrey Prosser (1694&#150;1781), gentleman, and Eleanor Witherston (1708&#150;1779), his wife, who both have prominent gravestones in the floor of the church at St Margarets, Herefordshire.<br>
<br>Prosser was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, as a commoner in 1767, graduated BA in 1770, and proceeded MA (1773), BD (1784), and DD (1797). He was elected a chaplain-fellow in 1773, having been ordained deacon in London in 1771. He took his full share of the various college offices, was a university proctor in 1783&#150;4, and earned a reputation as a painstaking tutor. The anatomist Matthew Baillie was one of his pupils. In his time there was a series of fellowship election disputes in which he was consistently for ability against interest. Later, as one of Balliol's elder statesmen with Baillie, he promoted the same principle, and, by a testamentary codicil made in 1828, established six exhibitions to encourage &#145;the Intellectual Improvement of the Undergraduates of Balliol College&#146;, prescribing &#145;that no Exhibition shall ever be given to any Undergraduate whose literary and scientific attainments are not respectable and worthy of distinction&#146;. He was the first of the tory disciplinarians who in such ways laid the foundations of Benjamin Jowett's Balliol.<br>
<br>Prosser was nominated curate of Spelsbury, Oxfordshire, in 1790, and in 1792 took the Balliol living of All Saints, Colchester, where he was an active resident incumbent. After the customary year of grace he resigned his Balliol fellowship. He married Sarah (1753&#150;1824), daughter of the wealthy barrister Samuel Wegg FRS (1723&#150;1802), of Colchester and Acton, on 20 June 1796. Soon after his marriage Prosser was preferred to the rectory of Gateshead by Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, and in 1804 was collated to the third prebendal stall of Durham Cathedral. In 1808 he was appointed archdeacon of Durham, to which the rectory of Easington was annexed until 1832. He became very attached to Easington, to which he gave communion plate in 1817, and he also built (1814) and endowed (1833) a parochial charity school there. Sarah Prosser died on 4 March 1824 and was buried in Durham Cathedral, with a memorial; their only child, Richard Samuel (1797&#150;1809), was also buried there. In 1826 Prosser bought the mansion of Belmont, designed by James Wyatt, in the parish of Clehonger, Herefordshire, and associated lands. He lived mainly at Belmont thereafter, and resigned the archdeaconry in 1831, but continued to reside as a canon at Durham for three months every year until he was ninety.<br>
<br>A scholarly man with an extensive library, from which he bequeathed to Balliol an illuminated fifteenth-century translation of the letters of Ovid into Norman French, and a <span class="roman">Vulgate Bible</span> printed in 1521, Prosser left instructions that his own manuscript writings were to be burned. His only publications were sermons preached at a visitation at Newcastle (1797), to the House of Commons (1801), and at the consecration of Henry Bathurst, bishop of Norwich (1805).<br>
<br>Prosser died at Belmont on 8 October 1839 and was buried in Clehonger church, where there is a memorial. Thirty-five years as a golden canon of Durham had made him a very wealthy man. His principal heir was Francis Richard Haggit MP (1824&#150;1911), only son of Lucy Haggit, daughter of Prosser's sister Frances Parry; he changed his name to Francis Richard Wegg-Prosser by royal licence in 1849. Ironically much of the wealth accumulated by Prosser out of the unreformed Church of England assisted the recovery of English Roman Catholicism, because Wegg-Prosser, a convert in 1852, used much of it to establish and endow the Benedictine community which became Belmont Abbey.<br>
