<span class="headword">Davidson,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1549&#150;1604), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Dunfermline to unknown parents. Educated at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, where he matriculated in 1566, aged about seventeen, he served as a regent in the college after graduating MA in 1570 and acted as examiner before entering the ministry at Liberton in 1579. When teaching in the university, he heard Knox preach there during the latter's residence in St Andrews, wrote a play which Knox attended for the marriage of a minister, and followed it with his first poem, <span class="italic">Ane Breif Commendatioun of Uprichtnes</span>, printed in 1573, in praise of Knox; he also prepared a shorter poem on Knox's death in 1572. He incurred the hostility of Regent Morton in 1574 by writing <span class="italic">Ane Dialog or Mutuall Talking Betuix a Clerk and ane Courteour Concerning Foure Parische Kirks till ane Minister</span>, a satirical attack on Morton's reorganization of stipends by grouping several adjacent parishes together under the oversight of one minister, for which he was prosecuted by the privy council. Forced to flee to Argyll and then abroad, Davidson was aided by the early Ayrshire reformer Robert Campbell of Kingzeancleuch, who advised him to contact Christopher Goodman (once minister of St Andrews) in England who would find him safe passage to La Rochelle in France. His indebtedness to Campbell is reflected in his poem composed in 1574 (and printed in 1595) <span class="italic">A Memorial of the Life and Death of Two Worthye Christians, Robert Campbel of Kyneancleugh and his Wife Elizabeth Campbell</span>.<br>
<br>Davidson pursued his academic interests by proceeding to Switzerland, matriculating at the University of Basel in 1575 or 1576, and before returning home to serve as minister was recommended as chaplain in 1577 for the English Merchant Adventurers at Antwerp, but unsuccessfully, for the man appointed was his fellow presbyterian, Walter Travers. Expelled from England for offending Elizabeth by his preaching, Davidson was permitted by Morton to return home and was appointed minister of Liberton in 1579. He executed the church's sentence of excommunication in 1582 against Robert Montgomery, promoted by the crown to the archbishopric of Glasgow, for which he was threatened with assassination. He strongly opposed the government's efforts to remove John Durie from his ministry in Edinburgh, and was active in defending ecclesiastical independence and a presbyterian polity. In the general assembly of June 1582, Andrew Melville as moderator had to ask Davidson &#145;to moderat his zeale&#146; and in 1583 David Ferguson feared that Davidson would presume too far in his criticism of King James  (Calderwood, 4.623&#150;4). He made common cause with the English puritan leader John Field, with whom he corresponded in 1583 on whether the general assembly might intervene on behalf of the English presbyterians. Field's response was positive, and when the general assembly met, representations were made to King James that he urge Queen Elizabeth to &#145;disburdein their brether of Ingland of the yocke of ceremonies imposed upon them against the libertie of the Word&#146;  (Thomson, 2.613&#150;14).<br>
<br>With the onset of Arran's anti-presbyterian administration at home, Davidson was one of the presbyterians who fled to England in 1584, serving for a spell as minister to the exiled ultra-protestant lords who had assembled at Newcastle, before proceeding south to London. He visited Oxford and Cambridge universities and in London he attended the funeral of James Lawson, minister of Edinburgh, who had died in exile in London on 12 October 1584. Encouraged by his fellow exiles to refute Cardinal William Allen's <span class="italic">A True, Sincere and Modest Defence of English Catholiques</span> (1584), in which Allen had condemned the Scottish ministers as seditious and rebellious, Davidson prepared a short vindication in 1584. He was active, too, in preaching twelve or thirteen sermons in St Olave Jewry, in London, on Sundays and holy days, beginning on 8 November 1584, and &#145;so railed against the king of Scots in the pulpit&#146; that he was known &#145;at court and among the bishops as a thunderer&#146; (Laing, 428&#150;9; Calderwood, 4.247). Commanded to cease preaching by the bishop of London in January 1585, Davidson ministered to the banished Scottish nobles at Westminster in May 1585. By November the lords were back in Scotland and, following their <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, an invitation was extended from those ministers who had arrived at Stirling with the nobles to Davidson and fellow exiles to return home. He is known to have &#145;remained a long tyme in Ingland&#146; where he saw for himself &#145;the corruption of the Bishops there&#146; and on returning home he denounced &#145;that corruption at all tymes as occasion offered&#146;  (Row, 420).<br>
<br>Davidson may have returned by 1586, when the general assembly appointed a minister of that name to a committee to investigate the character and conduct of certain bishops and commissioners, though this more probably was the minister of Hamilton who shared his name. In any event, he did not return to a settled ministry, and it is tempting to identify him with &#145;Daverson, a Skott, who preached at Aldermanbury church on St Peters day&#146; in London on 29 June 1588  (Donaldson, 79). In that year, too, he declined an invitation to return to his old congregation at Liberton, and in June 1589 was chosen to preach first in Edinburgh and then in the Canongate, until such time that he obtained a particular charge. Nothing came of a proposal in September 1589 to appoint him minister of Dalkeith, but, at the request of Edinburgh presbytery he wrote a reply that year to Richard Bancroft's sermon at Paul's Cross in London against the polity of the Scottish church. His tract <span class="italic">D. Bancroft's Rashnes in Rayling Against the Church of Scotland</span> was printed in Edinburgh by Waldegrave in 1590, despite James's efforts to have it suppressed. He also addressed a letter, at the request of ministers, to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 defending the polity of the Scottish church against Bancroft's attack.<br>
<br>Davidson opposed Queen Anne's coronation on the sabbath in 1590, and in 1591 admonished the king for his &#145;contempt of our ministrie&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.130&#150;31). In a sermon in 1592 he succeeded in offending the king once again; and in 1593 quarrelled with the moderate David Lindsay, minister in South Leith, who was susceptible to royal influence. To Archbishop John Spottiswoode, he was the maddest man he ever knew, but presbyterians saw him in a different light, as &#145;a man of authoritie in the Word and Spreit of God&#146; and &#145;a zealus grave father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 172, 357), as &#145;a free rebuker of sinne&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.238), and as &#145;a learned man, and a worthie preacher, yea, a verie prophet of God&#146;  (Row, 420). Opposed to ecclesiastical representation in parliament, he firmly believed in the doctrine of the &#145;two kingdoms&#146; and in 1598 went so far as to inform the king that he sat in assemblies not &#145;as <i>Imperator</i>, but as a Christian&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.683). When James complained in 1598 that Davidson spoke &#145;anabaptisticall-like&#146; and was too friendly with the English puritan John Penry, who spent some time in Scotland between 1589 and 1592, Davidson responded that &#145;he was no Anabaptist, and agreed not with Mr Penrie&#146;  (ibid., 698). He voiced a strong protest when the king discharged Andrew Melville from attending the assembly in 1598, and he himself was warded in 1601 for a letter sent by him to the general assembly at Burntisland.<br>
<br>Inducted to the parish of Prestonpans in Haddingtonshire in January 1596, Davidson founded a school and built a church and manse largely at his own expense. There he prepared a catechism, printed in 1602 by Waldegrave in Edinburgh under the title <span class="italic">Some Helpes for Young Schollers in Christianity</span>, in which he quoted scriptural passages from the <span class="roman">Bishops' Bible</span> produced in England by Archbishop Matthew Parker in 1568 instead of the <span class="roman">Geneva Bible</span> of 1560 which had proved more popular in Scotland. Before his death, which occurred in August or September 1604, he wrote <span class="italic">De hostibus ecclesiae Christi</span> wherein he affirmed that &#145;the erecting of Bishops in this Kirk is the most subtill and prevalent mean to destroy and overthrow religion that ever could have been devysed&#146;  (Row, 421). He was also the author of several other texts.<br>
