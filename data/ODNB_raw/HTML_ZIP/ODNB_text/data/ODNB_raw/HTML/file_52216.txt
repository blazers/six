<span class="headword">Refham <span class="st"> [ le Botoner]</span>, Sir  Richer</span>  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1328), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was the son of Ralph of Refham, vintner, and probably came from Reepham, a centre of the cloth-producing area of Norfolk, although the name was common in the county; he was a relative of a namesake who was a taverner of London. His alternative name Le Botoner suggests he was apprenticed to one of the prosperous Botoners, mercers of London. By 1294 Refham is known to have been buying large amounts of mercery from the Bellardi of Lucca and from Parisian merchants; the frequency of bonds to him may suggest he was a moneylender as well as a supplier to many lesser retailers. He was probably shipping wool from an early date, as he acted as collector of the wool custom from 14 May 1303 to 30 November 1306 (as well as collector of the new custom from 10 February 1303 to 30 November 1306). He was married by 1294 to Joan, the sister of Walter Furner; they had two sons: John, his heir and the only son mentioned in his will, for whom he arranged a prestigious marriage in 1307 to Margaret, daughter of Sir John Blund (mayor 1301&#150;7), and Roger. His own sister, Joan, married another successful mercer, Robert Callere.<br>
<br>Elected alderman and sheriff in 1298, Refham lost his aldermanry in 1300 after a quarrel with Henry le Waleys (<i>d</i>. 1302); but he was re-elected in 1302 and was mayor 1310&#150;11. He immediately had a collection of the city's customs read to an assembly of citizens, and gained support for his seeking the king's confirmation of the city's liberties; he endorsed the regulations of at least five guilds during his term; he put down nuisances and proceeded energetically against disturbers of the peace. His term coincided with the crisis between the ordainers and Edward II. The sparse evidence for the political activities of Londoners is hard to interpret, but as mayor Refham arrested the Frescobaldi on behalf of the ordainers, and subsequently released them at the order of the king. More critical for his civic survival, according to Andrew Horn's brief account, was his enforcement of the law in the matter of the estate of the heir of a mercer, Peter of Sparham, whose widow married William Hackford, one of the dilatory sureties arrested by Refham. Hackford, a politically active mercer who supported the ordainers, was able to sway his fellow mercers against Refham, ensuring that he did not achieve a second mayoralty and lost his aldermanry soon after (1312).<br>
<br>Given Refham's exit from civic office at this time, it seems sensible to identify him with the Richer Refham who was active from 1315 to 1323 on royal commissions concerning such matters as shipwrecked merchandise, illegal trade in victuals to Scotland, and currency, in London, Southwark, and Norfolk (where he had lands), and who was sheriff of Norfolk, 1314&#150;15. The full extent of his usefulness to Edward I and Edward II is not known: but it is on record that he was collector of the customs; that he contributed &pound;100 of the city's 1000 marks for the war with Scotland in March 1311; that he administered the templars' property in London from December 1311 and the temporalities of the bishopric of London, 1316&#150;17; and that he stood surety for the king's horse-dealer when the latter was admitted to the city's freedom during his mayoralty; between 1309 and 1314 he regularly described himself in essoins as in the king's service. He was knighted before October 1317, an honour given to few London merchants. He remained a powerful figure in the city despite his lack of office, not least because of his property there, and he was one of several wealthy citizens unsuccessfully attacked during the eyre of 1321.<br>
<br>Refham was conspicuously successful, but his uncompromising personality made him many enemies. Andrew Horn described him as &#145;austere and swift to administer justice, sparing no one&#146;  (Stubbs, 175&#150;6). This is borne out by the many complaints against him as collector of the new custom that were tried before the exchequer, though he was acquitted of any fraud. Other stories give a similar impression of a harshly just man: he complained of his fellow sheriff's allegation that Refham had defrauded him of 200 marks of their joint profits from office&#151;consequently the accusation was withdrawn and he was offered a cask of wine in propitiation. It is likely that it was Richer rather than his fellow sheriff who insisted on prosecuting no less a person than Henry le Waleys for 50 marks due to their office.<br>
<br>Refham accumulated lands and rents in at least twenty-seven London parishes (including substantial holdings in and near the Mercery, and a great wharf in the Vintry which he sold in 1309) and Southwark, the manor of Stanford Rivers and land at Danbury and Little Baddow, Essex (for his heir, John), and the manors of Aylmerton and Cockthorpe in Norfolk. He died between 17 August and 17 October 1328. Refham's widow, Joan, died in 1343, and his eldest son, John, and grandson, also John, by 1352; much of his estate then passed via his second son, Roger, and great-granddaughter to Sir Adam Fraunceys (<i>d</i>. 1375) and the Charltons of Middlesex.<br>
