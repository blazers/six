<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  James</span>, fourth earl of Findlater and first earl of Seafield  (1663&#150;1730), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 11 July 1663, the second son of the five children of James Ogilvy, third earl of Findlater (<i>d</i>. 1711), and Lady Anna Seton (<i>c</i>.1632&#150;1687), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19060/', "Hugh Montgomery, seventh earl of Eglinton")</script>. He was educated under the guidance of a private tutor, Patrick Innes, and in May 1675 he proceeded to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he studied for three years. After a brief stay in the Netherlands in 1683, he settled down to his legal studies and was admitted to the bar as an advocate on 16 January 1685. In 1687 he married Anne (1671/2&#150;1708), daughter of Sir William Dunbar.<br>
<br>Ogilvy's political and parliamentary career began when he was elected to represent the burgh of Cullen, Banffshire, in the 1689 convention of estates, and he also represented Cullen in the parliament of 1689&#150;95. Ogilvy initially played a dubious role in the convention. On 16 March he subscribed the act which stated that the convention was a free and lawful meeting of the estates, but he was also one of the five members who voted against the &#145;forfaulture&#146; of James VII. George Lockhart of Carnwath in his memoirs observed that Ogilvy was &#145;much taken notice of by reason of a speech he made against the forfeiting of King James&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Scotland's Ruine&#146;</span>, 18). Yet Ogilvy appears to have fallen into line with the dominant faction very quickly, and on 5 April he was nominated to the committee of the convention instructed to oversee the election of magistrates for a new town council for Edinburgh, to be held in St Giles's on 10 April. Furthermore, on 13 April he was named as a member of the committee to consider the political condition and state of the councils and magistrates in the burghs of the kingdom as a whole. Ogilvy's speedy rehabilitation with the dominant faction was reflected in his appointment to the three-man committee of 12 April which was ordered to consider a proclamation in which no one would be allowed to speak or write against the government. On 23 April Ogilvy was also appointed as one of the commissioners to treat for a union of the kingdoms with England. He was also politically active in the parliamentary session of 15 April to 22 July 1690. On 27 July he was appointed to a committee to consider overtures given by the viscount of Tarbat in open parliament, and on 1 July he was added to the committees for the act concerning lease making, fines and forfeitures, and prohibiting the import of brandy and rum. Likewise, on 18 July he was appointed to the commission for plantation of kirks.<br>
<br>In 1693 Ogilvy was knighted and appointed as sheriff of Banffshire as well as solicitor-general of Scotland, a position which, according to Lockhart of Carnwath, was due to the patronage of William, third duke of Hamilton. He took the oath of allegiance and the assurance in parliament on 18 April 1693, and he was a member of the committee for security of the kingdom in the 1695 session of parliament. He supported the parliamentary report into the Glencoe massacre, but, pragmatic as ever, he informed William Carstares, the king's chaplain and close adviser in Scottish affairs, that he had &#145;acted a moderate part in all this&#146; and he was prepared to be ordered by King William &#145;as to the method of serving him as is my duty&#146;  (<span class="italic">State papers</span>, 258). As solicitor-general he had visited London on more than one occasion and made a favourable impression on the king. In the aftermath of the 1695 parliament Ogilvy was appointed as joint secretary of state with John, earl of Tullibardine, following the dismissal of James Johnston.<br>
<br>Ogilvy attended the 1696 parliament in the capacity of a lesser officer of state, and Sir John Hamilton took his place as the elected member of parliament for Cullen. On 24 June 1698 he was created Viscount Seafield and Lord Ogilvy of Cullen, and was appointed as the president of the 1698 session of parliament which met on 16 July. Sir James Murray of Philiphaugh noted that Seafield presided &#145;very extraordinary well, both readily, boldly, and impartially&#146;  (<span class="italic">State papers</span>, 383). Seafield managed the session to defend the king's interest, a difficult task given the controversy concerning the Darien crisis. He was one of the 108 members on 26 January 1700 who voted for a parliamentary address to the king concerning Caledonia, as opposed to a formal act. Seafield appears to have been opposed to the Darien scheme from the start, and Lockhart of Carnwath argued that Seafield was &#145;visibly against the interest of his country, and trimmed and tricked so shamefully in the affair of Darien that he thereby, from being generally well-beloved, drew upon himself the hatred of all who wished well to that glorious undertaking&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Scotland's Ruine&#146;</span>, 18&#150;19). His hostility to the scheme aroused the anger of the Edinburgh mob, and in June 1700 his Edinburgh lodgings were attacked after news reached the city of Campbell of Finnab's victory over the Spaniards at Darien in a small-scale skirmish. Ogilvy was appointed lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1700, and on 24 June 1701 he was created earl of Seafield, viscount of Reidhaven, and Lord Ogilvy of Deskford and Cullen.<br>
<br>Seafield retained the office of secretary of state, and, following the death of King William in 1702, a new warrant for a patent and commission was issued on 12 May by which he was appointed joint secretary, along with James, duke of Queensberry, with an annual pension of &pound;1000 sterling. Seafield therefore retained his political influence after Queen Anne's accession, and in 1702 he was appointed as one of the members of the ill-fated commission to treat for union with England. On 1 November of that year he was appointed lord high chancellor of Scotland and lord high commissioner to the general assembly which met in Edinburgh on 10 March 1703. He was present in the 1703 and 1704 sessions of parliament in the capacity of lord chancellor, and on 8 August 1704 he was appointed as one of the commissioners of supply for Banffshire. Later that year he was ousted from the chancellorship by John, second marquess of Tweeddale, but on 17 October he was appointed as joint secretary of state (with John, earl of Roxburghe) once more, and on 9 March 1705 he was reappointed as lord chancellor, following Tweeddale's dismissal.<br>
<br>In March 1706 Seafield was appointed to the second commission to treat for a union with England, the commission which negotiated the treaty of union with English commissioners. Seafield played an important role as lord chancellor and adherent of the court faction in managing the treaty through the parliament of Scotland in the final session of its existence. In his speech to the parliament on the opening day of the session on 3 October 1706, Seafield informed the house that:<blockquote>it must be of great Advantage to have this whole Island Unite under one Government, and Conjoyned entirely in Interest and Affection, having Equality of all Rights and Privileges, with a free Communication and Intercourse of Trade, which must certainly Establish our Security, Augment our Strength, and Increase our Trade and Riches.</blockquote>The pragmatic nature of Seafield's character was reflected in his belief that &#145;We can never Expect a more favourable Juncture for Compleating this Union, than at present, when her Majesty has not only Recommended it, but Declared, That she will Esteem it the greatest Glory of Her Reign, to have it perfected&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, <i>1702&#150;7</i>, 11.98&#150;9). Lockhart's memoirs indicate that Seafield was fully aware of the role played by the Scottish treasurer, David Boyle, earl of Glasgow, in the distribution of &pound;20,000 sterling for payment of arrears of salary in the winter of 1706, which would later lead to the view that Scottish members of parliament had been bribed. Seafield received &pound;490 sterling of this money. In one of the most famous events in Scottish history, Seafield signed the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in the capacity of chancellor of Scotland, and, in face of the assembled Scottish parliament, handed it back to the clerk, exclaiming &#145;now there's ane end of an old song&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Scotland's Ruine&#146;</span>, 204).<br>
<br>Seafield was chosen as one of the sixteen peers to represent Scotland in the new parliament of Great Britain, and he was continuously re-elected until 1727. He was sworn of the English privy council in 1707, and was also appointed as lord chief baron of the exchequer in the same year. His services in securing the Union in Scotland were recognized in 1708 with a pension of &pound;3000 sterling per annum. Following the death of his father in 1711, he took the additional title of earl of Findlater. Nevertheless, his disillusionment with the progress of the Union came to the fore in 1713, when he introduced a bill for its repeal. His main grievance focused on the application of the malt tax to Scotland, but he also cited the abolition of the Scottish privy council, the extension of English treason legislation to Scotland, and the bar on Scottish peers' being peers of Great Britain. His motion was defeated by only four votes, a telling indication of the state of the Union at that particular time. In November 1713 he was reappointed lord chancellor, and he became keeper of the great seal of Scotland shortly afterwards. Seafield died on 15 August 1730 at Cullen, where he was buried. He left a historical legacy as one of the key Scotsmen in the securing of the Union of 1707.<br>
