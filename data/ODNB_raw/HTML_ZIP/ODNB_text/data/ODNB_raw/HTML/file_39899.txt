<span class="headword">Higginbottom,  Frederick James</span>  (1859&#150;1943), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 21 October 1859 at Accrington, Lancashire, the son of Matthew Fielding Higginbottom, a mathematics tutor, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sykes. After a private education in Liverpool, Higginbottom began his career in journalism with the <span class="italic">Southport Daily News</span>, at the age of fifteen. He had learned enough by 1879 to take up the editorship of the <span class="italic">Southport Visiter</span>, described in his memoirs as a &#145;social paper&#146; but offering scope to develop his skills as a political reporter. By 1881 Higginbottom's enterprise had attracted the attention of the Press Association; the London-based news agency sent him to Dublin in 1882, where he remained as its special correspondent for almost ten years. His reporting during an especially troubled phase of Anglo-Irish relations established the Press Association as the principal supplier of Irish news for the London and provincial press. In 1884 Higginbottom married Ann Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Edwin H. Neville.<br>
<br>On returning to London, Higginbottom served briefly as a parliamentary correspondent for a Dublin paper and, in 1892, founded the London Press Exchange, which flourished as an advertising-cum-news agency servicing the requirements of provincial newspapers. He also began his long association with the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, the London evening newspaper made famous by W. T. Stead in the 1880s but by Higginbottom's time rather past its prime in terms of influence and circulation. It is clear from his memoirs that he felt most comfortable as a member of the parliamentary press lobby; he stayed there as the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette's</span> political correspondent until 1900. After a short stay at the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, Higginbottom returned to the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, succeeding Sir Douglas Straight as editor in April 1909. His two years in the post represent the pinnacle of his career. He maintained the paper's &#145;independent Conservative&#146; stance, backing resistance to the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> in 1911. Though this earned the gratitude of the Conservative faction, who opposed &#145;wobbling and scuttling&#146;, it did not arrest the decline of the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, which was reported to be losing about &pound;20,000 a year, with sales dipping below 10,000. Under Higginbottom's editorship, the paper was, according to one description, &#145;undistinguished but workmanlike&#146;  (Scott, 392&#150;3).<br>
<br>By the end of 1911 Waldorf Astor, owner of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, was seeking an editor who could offer more than a safe pair of hands. Higginbottom moved aside for J. L. Garvin, whose work at the <span class="italic">Observer</span> he had recommended to Astor; the transition appears to have been without acrimony. Higginbottom was re-employed as parliamentary correspondent at the same salary. Apart from an interlude as director of press intelligence for the Ministry of National Service in 1917&#150;18, he remained a parliamentary correspondent for the rest of his career, which concluded with an attachment to the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> from 1919 to 1930. He died suddenly at his home, The Lawn, Briston, Norfolk, on 12 May 1943.<br>
<br>Higginbottom took pride in being a working journalist. His connection with the Institute of Journalists, dating from its foundation in 1890, allowed him to campaign for appropriate professional standards and, through stewardship of the institute's provident fund, to show a concern for the welfare of journalists who had fallen on hard times. Even after his retirement Higginbottom continued to contribute to the institute's <span class="italic">Journal</span>. At the end of his life he was engaged in debate with those who favoured an academic training for journalists; characteristically, Higginbottom preferred a more practical apprenticeship beginning &#145;in a provincial newspaper office, where the pupil learns something of all departments and a good deal of some&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, March 1943).<br>
