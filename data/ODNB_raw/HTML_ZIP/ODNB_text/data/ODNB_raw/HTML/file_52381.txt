<span class="headword">McCance,  Robert Alexander</span>  (1898&#150;1993), <span class="occ">physician and research physiologist</span>, was born on 8 December 1898, at Woodbourne, near Dunmurry, south-west of Belfast, the third son of John Stouppe Finlay McCance (1865&#150;1926), barrister and linen merchant, and Mary Letitia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bristow (1865&#150;1948). (Through a mistake on his father's part, his birth certificate wrongly recorded his birth date as 9 December.) He had a younger sister, Elizabeth. At the age of eight he began his formal education at Mourne Grange, a preparatory school near Kilkeel, co. Down, and when he was thirteen he entered St Bees School, Cumberland, where his brothers Finlay and Harry had preceded him. In 1947 he was appointed a governor of the school, and he held this office for thirty-five years.<br>
<br>On leaving school in 1916 McCance applied for a commission in the Royal Naval Air Service. He was called up in 1917 and trained to fly single-seater aircraft (Camels), but later flew two-seater aircraft from a wooden platform mounted over the midship gun turrets of the battle cruiser <i>Indomitable</i>. He was demobilized in 1919 and, deciding to make agriculture his career, was advised to obtain the diploma in agriculture at the University of Cambridge. After six months working on a farm in northern Ireland he entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1919. On his tutor's advice he took the natural sciences part one course first, and obtained first-class honours in 1921. He gave up the idea of agriculture as a profession, and took the part two physiology course under Sir Joseph Barcroft, achieving second-class honours in 1922. In the same year he married Mary Lindsay (Mollie) MacGregor (1898&#150;1965), daughter of Dr Duncan Otto MacGregor, physician, of Glasgow, and a student at Girton; they had one son and one daughter. McCance spent the next three years in the department of biochemistry under Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, which led to a PhD in 1926. By this time McCance had decided to study medicine, and his next move was to King's College Hospital, London. He obtained his MB in 1927 and MD in 1929, and was made MRCP in 1930 and FRCP in 1935. He was interested in diabetes, and spent a year assisting R. D. Lawrence in the new diabetic clinic. Although insulin had recently become available it was still important for diabetics to regulate the amount of carbohydrate in their diet. Because published values for the carbohydrate content of foods were unsatisfactory he analysed more than a hundred plant foods for available carbohydrate, and published the values with Lawrence as a Medical Research Council <span class="roman">Special Report</span> in 1929.<br>
<br>A new biochemical laboratory was set up at King's College Hospital in the early 1930s, and McCance was appointed as its head. Although he was responsible for the biochemical requirements of the hospital, he was able to spend time on research, and in the mid-1930s made his seminal studies of the effects of salt deficiency on the human body. The analysis of foods continued, and plant, meat, fish, and other common foods were analysed for ten constituents. The results were published by McCance and his colleague Elsie M. Widdowson in 1940, as a Medical Research Council <span class="roman">Special Report</span> entitled <span class="italic">The Chemical Composition of Foods</span>.<br>
<br>In 1938 McCance accepted an invitation from J. A. Ryle, regius professor of physic in Cambridge, to return there as reader in medicine. He was allocated laboratories in the pathology department and beds in Addenbrooke's Hospital for patients with rare diseases. The laboratories were soon occupied by research and junior staff, and visiting scientists from the UK and overseas.<br>
<br>Food analysis continued, and second and third editions of the tables, containing the composition of more foods, were published in 1946 and 1960. The Ministry of Food then took over the responsibility for updating the tables, which at the time of writing are in their fifth edition. They are the standard publication on the composition of foods in the UK, and are used worldwide.<br>
<br>McCance (Mac or Prof to his colleagues) was not a lone worker, and always had one or more collaborators; he was interested in the physiology of the whole body, and the subjects of his research ranged widely. During the early part of the Second World War he was engaged with Andrew Huxley, James Robinson, Widdowson, and others in a study of rationing, which involved living on a diet extremely low in fat for three months before cycling the 200 miles from Cambridge to the Lake District, and walking 36 miles up hill and down dale in one day, in deep snow and with heavy rucksacks. The study concluded that such rationing was unlikely to lead to any loss of physical fitness; it was also the origin of the proposal to add calcium to flour used for bread-making to offset the effects of rationing of dairy products. Later in the war McCance chaired a joint Medical Research Council and Royal Navy committee on survival at sea which for the first time demonstrated conclusively that it was better to drink nothing at all than to drink seawater. Among other things, the committee's work led also to the development of new pills for seasickness, and a new design for covered inflatable life-rafts, which subsequently saved many shipwrecked seamen from death through exposure. In 1945 the University of Cambridge, jointly with the Medical Research Council, created a personal chair for McCance and, as a tribute to the French scientist Claude Bernard, he chose the title professor of experimental medicine, the first of such titles in the UK.<br>
<br>In the years before his retirement, one of McCance's major interests was the physiology of the newborn infant. He found that at birth the kidneys are immature and an excess of certain nutrients in manufactured milk formulae may do harm. This work inspired others to study the physiology of infancy, which became a subject in its own right. The Neonatal Society was founded, with McCance as first president, and it now holds an annual McCance lecture. On his retirement in 1966 the Medical Research Council asked him to go to Uganda as temporary head of their Infantile Malnutrition Research Unit in Kampala. He spent two years there, and greatly enjoyed the experience.<br>
<br>In 1968 he returned to Cambridge, where he spent the rest of his life. He was fond of walking, but his favourite mode of travel was cycling, which gave him &#145;uninterrupted time to think&#146;. His bicycle was fitted with a cyclometer, and between 1939 and 1969 he cycled 200,000 miles, equivalent to eight times round the world. In the late 1970s he was knocked off his bicycle, fracturing a femur, which led to a shortening of his right leg. However, he continued to walk several miles a day until he had another fall about ten years later, which resulted in a fractured pelvis. He then became more and more disabled, and had to move to sheltered accommodation. His many friends, including past colleagues and students, visited him when they could, often seeking his advice. All had valued the years they spent working with him. He published more than 300 papers in scientific journals, six Medical Research Council <span class="roman">Special Reports</span>, and, with E. M. Widdowson, a book entitled <span class="italic">Breads, White and Brown; Their Place in Thought and Social History</span> (1956).<br>
<br>He died of a chest infection at the home where he lived, Shelford Lodge, 144 Cambridge Road, Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, on 5 March 1993, and was cremated on 11 March at Cambridge crematorium; his ashes were taken to Sidney Sussex College garden. A memorial service was held in the college chapel on 16 April. His wife had died in 1965, but he was survived by a son and daughter, seven grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.<br>
