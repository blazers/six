<span class="headword">Malet,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1071?), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was lord of Graville-St Honorine in the Norman Pays de Caux; his much-debated byname has been explained as meaning &#145;one who conducts a mail-horse and its baggage&#146;. Of unknown parentage, he was described by Gui of Amiens as part Norman and part English and as <i>compater</i> <i>Heraldi</i>, which indicates either spiritual affinity to or close companionship with Harold Godwineson. His father was probably his predecessor as lord of Graville and tenant of the Giffards in numerous other fiefs in the same region. Legends associating his son-in-law Turold the Sheriff with Godgifu (Godiva) of Mercia, mother of Harold's wife, probably indicate a relationship between William's mother and the earls of Mercia or their wives. A strong association of William and his family with Lincolnshire suggests that his English roots lay there.<br>
<br>Between 1060 and <i>c</i>.1066 William Malet occurs with William I in a number of charters relating to the abbeys of Montivilliers and Jumi&egrave;ges. He was associated with the abbey of Pr&eacute;aux in the Lieuvin, of which he was given the fellowship by Abbot Ansfrid in 1060, and with the abbey of Bec, which later mistakenly identified him with his descendant, a monk of the same name. His interests in the region of Lisieux probably originated in his marriage to Esilia, daughter of Gilbert Crispin, castellan of Tilli&egrave;res in the Vexin. William fought at Hastings and was soon credited with having been ordered to bury Harold's body on the seashore; whether he had anything to do with Harold's burial is uncertain, but it now seems clear that the body was buried at the church Harold founded at Waltham. In 1068 William became castellan of the first castle at York and sheriff of Yorkshire. In September 1069 the city was attacked by Danes. Briefly held captive, William, his wife, and their younger children were among the few to escape alive. He lost the shrievalty of York and the land associated with it soon afterwards, and was thereafter occupied in suppressing the fenland revolt led by Hereward the Wake. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> makes it clear that he died in the campaign, probably in 1071.<br>
<br>At his death, the bulk of William Malet's wealth lay in the vast lordship (the honour of Eye) granted to him in East Anglia, principally in Suffolk (where he had a castle and a market at Eye), but also in Norfolk, Essex, Surrey, Bedfordshire, and Nottinghamshire. His heir was his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17878/', "Robert Malet")</script>, who occurs with his father from shortly before 1066. Of William's numerous other children few can be identified. He had another son Gilbert, a daughter Beatrice, wife of Guillaume d'Arques, and a daughter who married Alfred of Lincoln. Another daughter married Turold the Sheriff; their daughter Lucy became the principal heir of the family's Lincolnshire estates. Close examination of <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> strongly indicates that Durand Malet was another of William's sons and not his brother, as is often stated.<br>
