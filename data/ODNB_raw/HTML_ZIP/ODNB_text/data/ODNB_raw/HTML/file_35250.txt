He attended Addiscombe College from 1846 to 1847, and obtained his commission in the 14th Bengal native infantry of the Bengal army on 8 December 1848. In 1852 he married Eliza Ellen, daughter of Lieutenant Nisbett, Bengal army, who died at Rawalpindi in 1870.<br>
<br>On the mutiny of his regiment in 1857 Norman was attached to the Ferozepore Sikh regiment, and remained at Ferozepore during subsequent operations. In 1863 he took part in the second expedition against the Yusufzais at Ambela, and was present at the storming of the conical hill and the destruction of Laloo. He was mentioned in dispatches. In the three following years he was engaged during the Bhutan campaign in the capture of Dewangiri and of the stockades in the Gurgaon Pass, serving as assistant quartermaster-general and receiving a brevet majority. In 1868 he took part in the Hazara campaign as second in command of the 24th (Punjab) regiment.<br>
<br>In the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80) Norman commanded the 24th in the Bazar valley and the defence of Jagdalak, marching with Robert's force from Kabul to Kandahar and taking part in the battle of Kandahar. Mentioned in dispatches, he received a CB and brevet colonelcy. During the war with Burma in 1885&#150;6 he commanded the Bengal brigade of the Upper Burma field force, assisting in the occupation of Mandalay and Bhamo. He was promoted KCB in 1886, attained the rank of major-general on 1 September 1889, and left India in 1891. He became lieutenant-general on 25 April 1892.<br>
<br>In March 1892 Norman married Caroline Matilda, daughter of the Revd W. W. Cazalet and widow of Major E. F. J. Rennick, Bengal staff corps, who survived him. He died on 25 June 1901 at Dulwich and was buried in Norwood cemetery. He left three sons and three daughters; one of the latter, Edith, was the wife of Sir Louis W. Dane (1856&#150;1946), lieutenant-governor of the Punjab.<br>
