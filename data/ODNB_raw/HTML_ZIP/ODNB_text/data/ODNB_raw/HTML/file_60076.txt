</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peierls, Sir  Rudolf Ernst</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">theoretical physicist</span>, was born on 5 June 1907 in Obersch&ouml;neweide, a suburb in the south-east of Berlin, the youngest of the three children (Alfred (<i>b</i>. 1899); Annie (<i>b</i>. 1901); and Rudolf) of Heinrich Peierls (1867&#150;1945), an electrical engineer from Breslau (Wroc&#322;aw) and managing director of a cable factory of the Allgemeine Elektrizit&auml;ts-Gesellschaft (AEG), and his first wife, Elisabeth 
    (Elli; 1878&#150;1921)
  , daughter of Alfred Weigert (1848&#150;1896) and his wife, Olga Hamburger, both of Breslau. Rudolf's parents were first cousins through the Weigert line. The Peierls families were assimilated Jews; Heinrich's children were baptized Lutheran. Rudolf's primary education was at a local preparatory school; his secondary education was at the local <i>Gymnasium</i>, later named the Humboldtsch&uuml;le. In 1925 he passed the <i>Abiturium</i>, the high-school graduation examination, and then gained some practical experience in the AEG factory, which confirmed his inclination towards studies in theoretical physics. Rudolf's mother had died when he was fourteen years old; his father then married Else Hermann, about 1924. Rudolf and his stepmother had a good relationship but by this time he was mostly absent from the family home. <h2>
<a name="Studyoverseas"></a>Study overseas</h2>In 1925 Peierls became a physics and mathematics student at Humboldt University, Berlin. He was critical of the physics professors' limited ability to interest students in their subjects. In 1926&#150;7 he moved to Munich University, where Arnold Sommerfeld was enthusiastically applying the wave mechanics of Paul Dirac and Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger. Peierls was especially attracted by the electron theory of metals and attended all the seminars and lectures which Sommerfeld arranged on this topic. He also met Hans Bethe, a year ahead of him, and they became lifelong friends. Since Sommerfeld was going abroad for 1927&#150;8 Rudolf joined Werner Heisenberg at Leipzig and worked out there a hole theory to explain the negative Hall effect observed in metals having an almost full conduction band. Since Heisenberg went away for spring term 1929 Rudolf moved to work under Wolfgang Pauli, at the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule in Z&uuml;rich, where he developed his fundamental work on thermal conductivity. He was the first to recognize the importance of the Umklapp-processes on the phonon-phonon interactions at very low temperatures. It took about twenty years before techniques had developed sufficiently to test his prediction; even then it was verified only for materials which were pure, not only chemically but also isotopically. This theoretical work gained Peierls the DPhil degree from Leipzig University in 1929.<br>
<br>Peierls then became Pauli's research assistant for three years, an unusually long appointment. He developed there the first band theory of electrons in a one-dimensional metal, using a weak periodic interaction to represent its effect on the lattice. In 1930 Peierls was invited to attend the annual physics congress at Odessa in August. Here he met a young physics student, Eugenia Kannegiesser (1908&#150;1986), from Leningrad, where she was a contemporary of Lev Landau, who was already known to Peierls. Their only shared language then was English, and Eugenia's English was quite limited. He went to Leningrad in spring 1931 to give a course of lectures. During his visit they married but she could not go to Z&uuml;rich with him, since she needed a passport and an exit visa before she could leave Russia. Peierls went back to Leningrad in the summer, and they left for Z&uuml;rich when her documents were ready. They had four children, Gaby Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1933), Ronald Frank (<i>b</i>. 1935), Catherine 
    (Kitty; <i>b</i>. 1948)
  , and Joanna (<i>b</i>. 1949).<br>
<br>Peierls was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship for 1932&#150;3, six months at Rome and six months at Cambridge. While they were in England the Nazi party gained control of Germany and they could not return. Fortunately Peierls was given a two-year fellowship by the Academic Assistance Council of Manchester. Hans Bethe was there for one year as an assistant lecturer, living with them. When Peierls and Bethe visited Cambridge, James Chadwick challenged them to provide a theoretical model for the photo-disintegration of a deuteron, whose rate he had just measured. On the train journey home they made a calculation of the process for him, assuming zero-range nuclear forces. This stimulated their interest in nuclear physics, which then became Bethe's main interest, Peierls following suit several years later. For 1935&#150;7 Peierls accepted a two-year fellowship at the Mond Laboratory of Cambridge University, for solid state physics research. Just before they left for Cambridge, Manchester University awarded Peierls an honorary DSc degree, a remarkable testimonial. In 1937 Peierls was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Birmingham University. <h2>
<a name="Nuclearweaponsresearch"></a>Nuclear weapons research</h2>When Otto Frisch visited Peierls from Copenhagen in 1939 Frisch was already uneasy about the Nazis, and he became stranded at Birmingham when Germany occupied Denmark. One day he asked Peierls how much U235 would be needed to make a U235 bomb. Peierls estimated this to be about 1 kg, a result which astonished them. The smallness of their value resulted from including <i>fast</i>-neutron fission of U235, which had not been considered by anyone else. They wrote an account of their calculations in March 1940, including a perceptive note about the human damage which would result if their superbomb were set off in a populated place, and sent it to higher authorities in Britain. The Peierlses took British nationality on 27 March 1940.<br>
<br>The MAUD committee (the British government committee set up to examine the civil and military uses of atomic science) discussed the Frisch&#150;Peierls memoranda, commented on them, and sent a copy to the USA about 1 June 1941. No response came from there until Oliphant, visiting the USA for other reasons, managed to convince Ernest Lawrence of their importance late in September, just before he returned to Birmingham. Lawrence then persuaded the American authorities to take it very seriously. As it happened, the American government decided on 6 December 1941 to build an atomic bomb; this was the day before the surprise attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.<br>
<br>Peierls and Francis Simon (another refugee from Germany, at Oxford University) saw that the separation of U235 from natural uranium (mostly U238) was vital for the success of the Frisch&#150;Peierls proposal. Peierls kept on with a variety of calculations bearing on this separation problem, almost alone&#151;pouring forth memoranda on uranium separation questions&#151;until 28 May 1941, when he gained an assistant, Klaus Fuchs (naturalized British on 18 June 1941), who gave Peierls strong support, providing him with quick and accurate theoretical calculations when necessary. Both Peierls and Simon judged gaseous diffusion (of uranium hexafluoride) to be the most efficient process for separation, although it would require a large number of stages and therefore a large plant. It was realized early on that it was not feasible to build this plant in Britain under wartime conditions. Early in 1942 Peierls and three colleagues visited the USA briefly and were made welcome; they found that their American colleagues were making great progress without them. However, there was little further UK&#150;USA contact&#151;indeed it was forbidden by the US secret service&#151;until Roosevelt and Churchill were each made aware of this situation; their discussions then led to the Quebec agreement of August 1943. A much larger group of senior UK scientists then moved to the USA and joined the Manhattan project. Peierls became the leader of the implosion dynamics group (needed for the plutonium bomb) within the theoretical physics division, headed by Bethe, of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Peierls had demanded that Fuchs should accompany him, as his indispensable assistant. Peierls attended the Trinity test (of a plutonium bomb) at Alamogordo on 17 July 1945. In 1946 he was appointed CBE. <h2>
<a name="TheoreticalphysicsatBirmingham"></a>Theoretical physics, at Birmingham</h2>After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Peierls was free to return to England. After discussion he decided to return to Birmingham as professor of mathematical physics, where he had an independent department, strong on the research side, with some research fellowships attached. His department was housed in two wartime huts. Peierls soon put his stamp on the style of the department. The students were all placed under his supervision, generally working on problems suggested by him, but with some informal link to one of the postdoctoral members. Peierls was always a critical physicist; with new work he was well known for quickly asking searching questions. With the research students he was critical but in the end always encouraging, suggesting some new direction which could be tried, or some check which could be made, when the calculations made did not seem to accord with intuition. He was always positive and helpful in his remarks to them. Sometimes he would go to the blackboard and outline how the solution might be obtained, leaving the student to think it over, to fill in the details and to verify that the path proposed really did lead to the solution. No student was afraid of Peierls. He was very generous to many of them, not requiring his name on their published papers, even when he had proposed the topic and had made clear the method of the solution. All became conscious of being part of a common endeavour to push forward the frontiers of physics. There would often be discussion of tricky points around the daily lunch table. The atmosphere in the department was one of continual discussion&#151;the offices of the students were all close to each other, as well as to Peierls's office&#151;and the students learned of research as a way of life by following Peierls's example. Students who had gone through the department often developed their capabilities much more than they would have elsewhere. They had seen how theoretical physics could be done, following Peierls's style in the department. Peierls believed that theoretical physics was a co-operative venture in which interactions between physicists were crucial. This was the lesson he had learned in his years of wandering, going from one group to another for various reasons, to almost all the main centres of that time.<br>
<br>In summer 1947 Peierls held a national conference on nuclear physics, partly to place his department on the map. In 1948 he held an international conference, which was very successful, being perhaps the earliest such conference after the war. As a result of Peierls's personal connections with the major research centres, senior physicists came from widespread countries. From its beginning the department increased rapidly in both the number and the calibre of its students and staff.<br>
<br>Social links within the department were stimulated by parties organized by the Peierlses, inviting the entire department, together with their wives, at which group games were played, or there was dancing, or perhaps story-telling around the room. In the summer the parties were outdoors and the children would also take part. The atmosphere of the department was very happy, despite the crowding in it and the unavoidable noise from the corridor. One student there wrote in those early years: &#145;We are a happy family here and the Peierlses are father and mother to all&#146;  (private information). At Birmingham Peierls developed the major group in theoretical physics in Britain in his time. The times were anomalous, especially in the first ten years after the war. Many able students went to Birmingham because they were lacking proof of their ability in fundamental research, having worked in some rather narrow speciality during the war. Numerous older physicists chose Birmingham for their sabbatical year, and research students at other universities would choose to go to Birmingham for their final year, regarding it as a finishing school, after which they would write their PhD dissertations for their home universities.<br>
<br>One characteristic of Peierls's work was that he usually started from fundamentals, rather than from the work of others. This was the case for the Frisch&#150;Peierls memoranda. His development of the dynamics of dislocations in crystalline solids was sparked off by a question from Egon Orowan. He demonstrated from first principles, using simple steps, that the Ising model in two dimensions <i>must</i> have a phase-transition, contrary to general opinion. His novel treatment and use of resonant states in nuclear systems also started from fundamentals. These cases and others illustrate how, in Peierls's hands, new areas of theoretical physics could grow out of simple questions and thoughts about them. That &#145;Peierls always starts from fundamentals&#146; was the secret of his success and of his being one of the last of those wide-ranging universalists in physics&#151;those physicists who could, for example, do research in both nuclear physics theory and condensed matter theory.<br>
<br>In 1950 Peierls was very shocked to learn that Fuchs had turned over to the Russians copies of almost all the calculations he had carried out during the war, and other secret documents which passed through his hands, despite his signing the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>. At first Peierls could not believe this, but Fuchs said that there was no mistake. In the cold war era Peierls chose to resign his consultancy with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), Harwell, when he realized that as a result of Fuchs's treachery the US Security Service mistrusted him to such a degree that they were proposing not to permit AERE to receive US classified reports. <h2>
<a name="Wykehamprofessorship"></a>Wykeham professorship</h2>In 1963 the Wykeham professorship (theoretical physics) of Oxford University became free. When Peierls was asked to fill the chair he specified that there should be a department of theoretical physics to include all the theoretical physicists in Oxford, with a suitable building to house them all, and three adjoining houses were allocated to him.<br>
<br>The Oxford department of theoretical physics soon became larger than that at Birmingham and it was not possible for Peierls to work with all the students. It was divided into two large groups, elementary particle physics and condensed matter physics, and two smaller groups&#151;astrophysics and nuclear physics. The first three were each placed under a senior researcher, while the last was under Peierls, who also took some students in solid state physics. There was much more administration to be done by Peierls in connection with the department than was the case in Birmingham. He had to serve on many internal university committees and continued on a number of external committees, on which he now represented Oxford instead of Birmingham. The Oxford department continued to grow in numbers and he had to work hard to secure more floor space to accommodate all of them. There was less departmental sociability than at Birmingham, since the colleges already generated links between students of differing subjects within the college. The parties happened less often, not all attended, and were held in the department building. Peierls kept an interest in all the work going on and attended a large fraction of the specialist seminars and most of the more general seminars and colloquia. As a result theoretical physics at Oxford gradually became more coherent, a great improvement on the past. This growth of coherence may perhaps be Peierls's greatest single contribution to Oxford in his period there. He was elected FRS in 1945, receiving the society's royal medal in 1959 and its Copley medal in 1986. He was knighted in 1968.<br>
<br>Although Peierls devoted much energy to improving accommodation for the increasing department numbers, space was not made available to him until 1974, when he was about to retire; the department moved from 12 Parks Road to 1 Keble Road three years later when the rebuilding work was complete. Peierls had spent a number of summer vacations working at the University of Washington at Seattle; for his retirement he accepted an appointment to that university as a half-time professor for 1974&#150;7. After 1977 Peierls lectured at a number of summer schools. These lectures appeared in the proceedings volume for each school; he expanded his lectures at Les Houches (1953) to book length, publishing them under the title <span class="italic">Quantum Theory of Solids</span>.<h2>
<a name="AtomicScientistsAssociation"></a>Atomic Scientists' Association</h2>On his return to Birmingham in 1945 Peierls had played a leading role in forming an Atomic Scientists' Association, and was its first (acting) president. The association sought to inform the public about nuclear physics and nuclear energy, and especially the safeguards necessary in dealing with the decay properties of many nuclei. Their most effective means for this education was a travelling exhibition, known as the &#145;atomic train&#146;, which could stop at all towns served by railways. Later, by request, it also went abroad, and was very successful there. The association wound up in 1958 because it had achieved its purpose; also, the full members, those who had worked as professional nuclear scientists during the war, were diminishing in number. However, there was soon formed a British Pugwash Group, with Peierls as its first chairman until 1974, when he became an honorary (but active) member of its executive committee. <h2>
<a name="Peacemovements"></a>Peace movements</h2>Peierls attended his first International Pugwash conference in 1960, the sixth held and the first to be held in the USSR; he had met his Russian colleagues (for the first time after the war) at the Atoms for Peace conference at Geneva in 1955. He then attended the Pugwash conferences rather regularly; his ability with the Russian language was very helpful in discussions, for he could quickly clarify misunderstandings of technical translation. He became a member of its continuing committee (later named its council) in 1963, and its chairman in 1970, retiring from this post in 1974. In 1972 the twenty-second Pugwash conference was held in Oxford, when he was chairman of both International Pugwash and British Pugwash; the local arrangements were made by the latter group under his direction. In 1992 he attended the forty-second International Pugwash conference at Berlin&#151;his twenty-fourth and last attendance.<br>
<br>Throughout this period Peierls was deeply involved in the anti-nuclear weapons movement in Britain. In 1983 the UK Coalition for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze began, which became known as FREEZE. It was unilateral, urging only that the UK should cease the production, testing, and deploying of nuclear weapons. In 1985 Peierls became a patron of FREEZE, taking part in the advertising of this drive, and in collecting signatures at Oxford, all leading up to the &#145;Giant Letter&#146;, which was presented to the government. Late in 1986 he was made a FREEZE director. In this FREEZE period Peierls adopted the slogan &#145;nuclear weapons are not battleships&#146;; he felt that if people were able to understand this and its implications, they would give up the old &#145;numbers game&#146; so frequently adopted. In the 1990s he collaborated with C. Hill, R. Pease, and J. Rotblat to produce an 80-page report from the British Pugwash Group entitled &#145;Does Britain Need Nuclear Weapons?&#146;, reaching the conclusion &#145;No&#146;, published in 1995.<br>
<br>Lady Peierls died at Oxford on 25 October 1986. Sir Rudolf then travelled the world, attending seven more Pugwash conferences, giving physics seminars at universities along his way, some of which bestowed honorary DScs on him. The Institute of Physics elected him honorary fellow in 1973, awarding him the Guthrie medal in 1968 and the Paul Dirac medal and prize in 1991. He was elected to numerous foreign societies, being especially gratified by his membership of the Deutsche Akademie Leopoldina, for German-born scientists, in 1981. However, in 1993 he was overtaken by pneumonia at Rome, which required his transport back to England by air on a stretcher bed. He sold his Oxford flat and moved into the country at Oakenholt, near Farmoor, Oxfordshire, where he could be independent, but with ready help near at hand. He was almost blind and unable to read, but was still able to communicate with others by voice, most often by telephone. Kidney trouble required regular dialysis sessions for him at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, where he died on 19 September 1995.<br>
