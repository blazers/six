<span class="headword">Welsh,  John</span>  (1568/9&#150;1622), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland and French Reformed minister</span>, was born in Dumfriesshire, one of five children and the second son of John Welsh (<i>d</i>. 1600), laird of Collieston in Dunscore, and his wife, Marion Greir. He attended school locally, although he was a truant and, on leaving this first period of education, fell in with a band of border reivers. Falling on hard times he threw himself on the mercy of his parents, who sent him to the fledgeling college at Edinburgh where he matriculated in 1585 under the regency of Adam Colt and graduated MA in 1588, along with another twenty-nine students, eleven of whom were later ministers. Being ordained into the parish of Selkirk in 1589 he distinguished himself as the first Edinburgh graduate to enter the ministry. In this capacity, on 6 March 1590 the privy council appointed him to a commission to preserve the &#145;true religion&#146; in Ettrick Forest and Tweeddale. According to an early biography his spiritual zeal aroused &#145;the malice of the wicked&#146; in Selkirk and he was forced to leave after one local laird killed two of his horses  (Tweedie, 1.3). He was last recorded as minister of Selkirk on 11 March 1594 and was then translated to Kirkcudbright, where he remained for six years, also taking on the nearby charges of Galtaway, Dunrod, and Kilchrist. At about the time of leaving Selkirk he married Elizabeth, daughter of the reformer John Knox (<i>d</i>. 1572). They had six children, four sons and two daughters, although only three appear still to have been alive in January 1625 at their mother's death.<br>
<br>Welsh had an active career in the kirk. He was appointed by the general assembly of March 1596 &#145;to visit and try the doctrine, life, diligence and fidelitie&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.420) of ministers and to plant clergy in areas with no presbyteries in Nithsdale, Annandale, Lauderdale, Easdale, and Ewesdale. In December of that year he was in Edinburgh when its ministers fled after a confrontation with the king. Occupying the pulpit, he was himself suspended from the ministry for speaking in their support, for &#145;ellegeing that his Majestie was possest with a devill&#146; and for suggesting that, just as sons may restrain an insane father, so subjects might &#145;bind his Majestie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 5.359). He was outlawed for failing to appear before the privy council in January 1597, but was restored after a request from the general assembly. In 1598 he was appointed to a commission of the general assembly charged with examining complaints against the standing commission of the kirk and, in 1600 and 1602, was reappointed as a visitor in Nithsdale by the assembly. In 1599 he wrote the only one of his works to be published in Scotland during his life, <span class="italic">Popery Anatomized</span> (1602). Dedicated to James VI, it was a reply to criticisms of the kirk by Gilbert Brown, former abbot of the Cistercian house of Newabbey, taking the form of a 28-section, 440-page attack on Catholicism.<br>
<br>In August 1600 Welsh was translated to Ayr to be assistant to the ageing John Porterfield. On Porterfield's death in 1604 the people of Ayr called on the burgh council to confirm Welsh as his successor, which they formally did on 12 June. His daily preaching was said to be so popular that the council resolved to build a new kirk to accommodate the increased attendances, a plan which was, however, not carried out until long after Welsh's death. He took an active role in quelling factional violence which troubled Ayr on his arrival, even intervening in disturbances with only a helmet for protection and, once quarrels were quelled, staging public acts of reconciliation. There survive from his time at Ayr a number of stories which endow him with great spiritual gifts. People &#145;saw clearly a strange light surround him&#146;  (Tweedie, 1.12) while he was praying in his garden at night. In 1604, when plague was rife but Ayr was free of disease, he is said to have discerned, through prayer, that two merchants wishing to enter the town were carrying infection. They were sent away and were admitted to Cumnock where plague struck and &#145;the living were hardly able to bury their dead&#146;  (ibid., 1.13).<br>
<br>Welsh's service at Ayr came to a premature end in 1605. The king had not permitted the general assembly to meet since 1602, and many feared severe curtailment of ecclesiastical freedom, so when the assembly scheduled to meet at Aberdeen in July was also prorogued fourteen presbyteries, including Ayr, sent commissioners anyway. Although Welsh arrived in Aberdeen two days after the bulk of commissioners had already constituted and dissolved the assembly, he formally declared his support for their actions. He was the first to reach Edinburgh after the meeting. Summoned before the privy council he was warded in Blackness Castle and, after languishing there for three months, he again appeared before the privy council and, along with five others, rejected its competence in what they argued was an ecclesiastical matter. They were sent back to Blackness and the king demanded that they be tried for treason. This duly went ahead in the following January. John Forbes and Welsh, described at the time by the secretary of state, Lord Balmerino, as &#145;the strongest pillaris of that disorder&#146;, were appointed by the others to speak for all  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 7.478). Welsh warned the packed jury that they were usurping the jurisdiction of Christ, and thus, he said, &#145;yee &hellip; bring upon yourselves &hellip; the guiltines of our innocent blood&#146;  (Forbes, 485&#150;8). All six were found guilty and sentence was remitted to the king who, in October 1606, ordered that they be banished from his dominions. At two o'clock on the morning of 7 November they took ship at Leith after &#145;Mr Johne Welsche conceivit a prayer, quhilk bred great motioune in the heartis of all the heareres&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 670). The burgh council of Ayr continued to pay &#145;their weilbelovit pastor&#146; his stipend for a number of years after he was exiled, even though he was never to return  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 2.6).<br>
<br>Welsh sailed to Bordeaux, immediately set to learning the language, and was able, within fourteen weeks, to preach in French. He soon took up a ministerial charge at Nerac, then moved to Jonzac, where he published another anti-Catholic work, <span class="italic">L'Armageddon de la Babylon apocalyptique</span> (1612). Some time after 1613 he settled at St Jean-d'Angely. In 1620 the Huguenot town was besieged by Louis XIII and Welsh is said to have rallied the people and aided the gunners on the walls. Louis sought terms and it was agreed that St Jean would keep its walls, civic privileges, and religious freedom. Welsh was summoned before the king for his preaching but he impressed Louis by pointing out that his priests placed him under papal authority while Welsh argued that none on earth was the king's superior. After a subsequent siege the town was taken by the king, whereupon Welsh was given his freedom and transport to La Rochelle for himself and his family.<br>
<br>Welsh obtained permission to enter England where, pleading ill health, he attempted to get leave to return to Scotland. The dean of Winchester, John Young, tried to get Welsh to approve the Scottish ecclesiastical <i>status quo</i> as a condition of his return but he refused. Elizabeth Knox's pleadings before the king himself were similarly fruitless. James sought the same condition for his return and she replied, holding out her apron, &#145;Please your Majesty, I'd rather kep his head there&#146;  (McCrie, 396). Welsh was not granted liberty to preach in London until he was too frail to do so. He died there on 2 April 1622 aged fifty-three and was buried in the churchyard of St Botolph without Bishopsgate two days later. Subsequent to his death two collections of his sermons were published, <span class="italic">Thirty-Five Sermons</span> (1744) and <span class="italic">Forty-Eight Select Sermons</span> (1811), as well as <span class="italic">Discourses</span> (1752) and <span class="italic">A Cry to the Whole Earth</span> (1785).<br>
