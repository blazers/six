<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roper,  Lanning</span>  (1912&#150;1983), <span class="occ">landscape gardener and journalist</span>, was born on 4 February 1912 at West Orange, New Jersey, USA, the youngest of the three sons of Willet Crosby Roper (1877&#150;1966), a banker, and his wife, Florence Emeline Eveleth (1874&#150;1961). He had a happy and well-regulated childhood in West Orange and later Closter, New Jersey, governed by his father's daily commuting to the Wall Street bankers Brown Brothers, Harriman &amp; Co.: where Willet Roper spent his entire working life, and rose to be a director. The Ropers were proud of their ancestry, which was well documented back through eight generations to mid-seventeenth-century pilgrim settlers in Massachusetts: intensely patriotic, but Anglophile, they were liberally and intellectually inclined members of the dominant east coast white, Anglo-Saxon, protestant society. While his brothers chose conventional careers in farming and the law, Lanning was undecided about a profession. After high school in Englewood, New Jersey, he went to Harvard University to read fine arts and graduated with honours in 1933. He was advised against postgraduate landscape architecture, as it was felt that this infant profession was eminently disposable in those times of high unemployment; accordingly he went on to study architecture at Princeton University. Here he failed to finish his first year. He left to take up tutoring posts and eventually settled to teaching Latin and English at the smart Buckley School in midtown New York.<br>
<br>In his early twenties Roper was tall and well built, with blonde hair and blue eyes, always smartly dressed, he had a sunny sense of humour and great charm. He made the most of New York's musical and cultural offerings, and enjoyed life among a group of lively friends. In the long summer vacations he chose to tutor the children of well-to-do families so that he could indulge his passion for sailing and ocean racing; if a chance to visit the historic gardens of Newport, Rhode Island, or the Carolina shores was also part of the holiday, he was blissfully happy. This pursuit of pleasures had no time to pall: his family's sensitivity to events in Europe made him volunteer for the ranks of the national guard in early 1941, almost a year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and he gained a commission in the United States Naval Reserve on 16 March 1942. Service on shore patrols was succeeded by training to command large landing craft, and he crossed the Atlantic in the spring of 1944 to take part in the D-day landing at Omaha Beach with the US 115th infantry regiment. He was wounded in the action and awarded the US gold star medal. His war was completed at the &#145;stone frigate&#146; HMS Mastodon&#151;Exbury House, near Southampton&#151;and in naval intelligence at the headquarters of Naval Forces Europe in Grosvenor Square: here he was released from duty on 15 November 1945. His war experience had introduced him to the English landscape and gardens, and to such friends as Herbert and Barbara Agar, Walter and Margery Fish, Patrick Leigh Fermor, and the marquess of Normanby, all of whom encouraged him to stay in England and create gardens.<br>
<br>Although Roper had gardened happily as a child with his father at weekends, he realized the subject was taken more seriously in England and that he had much to learn. After some false starts he became a student at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and then in Edinburgh: soon gardening and garden visiting filled his life, as he realized he had found his vocation. In the autumn of 1951, just six months short of his fortieth birthday, he joined the staff of the Royal Horticultural Society in Vincent Square as assistant to the editor of the journal and other publications, Patrick Synge. His garden-writing career flourished with Synge's support, and through friendships formed with Christopher Hussey, who encouraged him to write for <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, and Eric Savill, deputy ranger of Windsor Great Park. His first book, <span class="italic">Royal Gardens</span>, was published in coronation year, 1953, with a foreword by Geoffrey Jellicoe; it was followed in 1959 by a larger volume, <span class="italic">The Gardens in the Royal Park at Windsor</span>.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1952 Roper married the artist Primrose Harley (1908&#150;1978) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67784/', "Roper, Primrose")</script>] and they lived at Park House, Onslow Square, in South Kensington. It was a marriage of complementary talents, embodied in the flowering of Park House as one of the most famous gardens of the day; it was photographed by Cecil Beaton and visited by thousands when it was opened as part of the National Gardens Scheme. A country garden in the heart of the city, achieved on a low budget and with minimal paid help, it was a tonic and an inspiration to town gardeners throughout Britain, and the workshop for Roper's <span class="italic">Successful Town Gardening</span>, published by <span class="italic">Country Life</span> in 1957. In that year he established himself as an independent garden consultant, and received a leaving commission from Patrick Synge to write <span class="italic">Hardy Herbaceous Plants</span> in the <span class="roman">Penguin Handbooks</span> series (1960). He was appointed gardening correspondent of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, a post which he held for thirteen years; his first piece appeared on 7 January 1962.<br>
<br>The garden of Park House is also featured in <span class="italic">The Sunday Times Gardening Book</span> (1967), Roper's finest book, which manifested his encyclopaedic knowledge of plants and his characteristic charm and enthusiasm for his subject. His contribution to a BBC Radio 3 talks series and book, <span class="italic">A Gardener's Dozen</span> (BBC/Royal Horticultural Society, 1980), offers further evidence of his almost sensual preoccupation with all things horticultural: he celebrated July, his allotted month, as a &#145;gourmet's delight&#146;&#151;Roper was a keen cook&#151;and wrote of roses, his &#145;great fondness for lilies&#146;, and &#145;weakness for clear yellow day-lilies, and an aversion to orange&#146;. He ended with the reflection that:<blockquote>the pleasures of July are heightened by the arrival of the first of the spring bulb catalogues. They lie temptingly on the table, perhaps near a big bowl of sweet peas or apricot and pink Ligtu Hybrid alstroemerias. So strong is the pull of the garden next spring that I for a moment forget the bounty of summer. Such is the nature of gardeners. (<span class="italic">A Gardener's Dozen</span>, 91&#150;103)</blockquote>Roper's well-defined tastes, his fine judgement, and his belief in doing all important planting and pruning work himself endeared him to a string of distinguished clients in almost 200 garden projects in Britain and Europe throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He worked on eight American gardens (he never relinquished his US citizenship and returned annually to visit family and friends). He was consultant to the National Trust for gardens including Scotney Castle, Chartwell, Tatton Park, Anglesey Abbey, and Waddesdon Manor, and to the National Trust for Northern Ireland on Castlecoole and Castle Ward. Among long-standing clients were Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, several members of the Sainsbury family, Peter Palumbo, and Henry P. McIlhenny, who was Roper's classmate at Harvard and the owner of Glenveagh Castle in co. Donegal.<br>
<br>Roper worked on gardens for major contemporary architectural projects, including the Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia (Norman Foster Associates) and the Hambro Life Centre, Swindon (Yorke, Rosenberg, and Mardall), and created the roof garden for the Ismaeli Centre, South Kensington (Casson, Conder &amp; Partners and Sasaki Associates). He also readily gave his time to charitable projects and to help young friends: the soul of discretion, he was much appreciated in royal gardening circles and was photographed by Lord Snowdon. His proudest moment was undoubtedly when he was invited to help the prince of Wales with his newly purchased garden at Highgrove House in Gloucestershire in early 1981. Their first meetings were promising, but by the time of the royal wedding in the summer of that year Roper knew that his health was failing, and he had regretfully to decline both an invitation to the ceremony and the garden commission.<br>
<br>Roper and his wife lived apart from the early 1960s and divorced in 1968, a source of deep sadness for Roper until the end of his life. From 1965 his London home was 29a Clarendon Gardens, Maida Vale, a comfortable <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> with the tiniest courtyard garden. He died from cancer on 22 March 1983, at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, and a memorial service was held at St Mary's, Paddington, on 21 April 1983; his ashes were scattered on the Mulgrave estate. In his will he gave personal gifts to his friends and bequeathed the remainder of his assets to the National Trust for the upkeep of Scotney Castle.<br>
<br>Roper was remembered with affection by many, including those who met him only through books and articles. His infectious enthusiasm and fine judgement of plants contributed much to the late twentieth-century popularity of gardening, while the &#145;restrained prettiness&#146; of his planting style was accessible to even the owners of very small gardens, with whom he always had a special empathy.<br>
