<span class="headword">Clive, Sir  Robert Henry</span>  (1877&#150;1948), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in London on 27 December 1877, the third and youngest surviving son, and fourth of the five surviving children, of Charles Meysey Bolton Clive JP (1842&#150;1883), gentleman, of Whitfield, Herefordshire, and his wife, Lady Katherine Elizabeth Mary Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Feilding (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter of William Basil Percy Feilding, seventh earl of Denbigh. His father was a first cousin four times removed of Clive of India. A younger brother died in infancy. Educated at Haileybury College and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated with a pass degree in classics in 1899, Clive entered the diplomatic service in January 1902. He was posted to Rome in February 1903 and promoted third secretary in April 1904. He was transferred to Tokyo in June 1905 and promoted second secretary in August 1908. On 10 July 1905 he married Magdalen Agnes Muir Mackenzie (1884&#150;1971), third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38848/', "Kenneth Augustus Muir Mackenzie, Baron Muir Mackenzie")</script>, permanent secretary to the lord chancellor from 1880 to 1915. They had two sons, Peter Julian (<i>b</i>. 1906) and Robert Wilfred Kenneth (<i>b</i>. 1909), and a daughter, Amy Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1913).<br>
<br>In April 1909 Clive was posted as second secretary to Cairo. Robert Vansittart, who served with him there, wrote that &#145;he was a man so modest that he might easily be overlooked&#146;, who represented a new type of diplomat without court or political connections  (Vansittart, 84). From Cairo, Clive was transferred to Bern in October 1911 and to Stockholm in October 1913, becoming a first secretary in August 1915 and acting on several occasions as charg&eacute; d'affaires.<br>
<br>In June 1919 Clive was transferred to the Foreign Office and appointed CMG. In January the following year he became counsellor in Peking (Beijing), remaining there until July 1923, when he was appointed consul-general at Munich. He was sent to inquire into the separatist movement which had succeeded in establishing itself in Bavaria, then under French occupation. His tact and perspicacity in carrying out this mission were an important contributory factor in the eventual restoration of order. He was present in Munich in November 1923 when Adolf Hitler and the nascent Nazi party tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Bavarian government. He reported to the Foreign Office that &#145;If Hitler had stayed in power for even one day, I do not believe that there would have been a French officer alive in Munich&#146;  (TNA: PRO, FO 371/8818, 9 Nov 1923). It was a tribute to his skill that the French authorities raised no objection when, in October the following year, he was appointed consul-general at Tangier. As the first British representative on the committee of control, he helped substantially to launch the new international regime set up by the convention of 1923 and to harmonize the interests of the signatory powers. Clive's five years as minister at Tehran, from October 1926 to September 1931, covered a period of increasing Persian nationalism and xenophobia, and his efforts to conclude a commercial and a general treaty were frustrated. His patience and the objectivity of his judgement were nevertheless of great value during this difficult period in Anglo-Persian relations. He was promoted KCMG in 1927.<br>
<br>After a short time as minister to the Holy See from March 1933 to May 1934, Clive was appointed ambassador in Tokyo, and was sworn of the privy council. Japan was no longer the country he had known in the heyday of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. The termination of the alliance in 1922, naval rivalry, Japan's conquest of Manchuria, and her withdrawal from the League of Nations in 1933 had estranged the two countries, while Japanese military ambitions were beginning to threaten British interests in China and the Far East. Clive's task was in the circumstances a difficult one, but he responded with his usual determination. He reduced tension, but he had few illusions about the dangers of the situation and his reports to the government were models of clarity and good sense. He was promoted GCMG in 1936. It was not until after his departure that Japan took the irrevocable step of attacking mainland China.<br>
<br>When Clive arrived in Brussels as ambassador in July 1937, Great Britain had lately renewed her guarantee to Belgium. That little progress was made towards the more specific understandings desired by his government was not for want of pertinacity on Clive's part, for he again displayed patience and clear-headedness. But he was unable to persuade King Leopold to abandon his &#145;policy of independence&#146;, reporting in January 1939 that the Belgian monarch wanted peace at almost any price, and would not agree to staff talks with the French because he feared that these would provoke the Germans. Clive told the Foreign Office that the Belgians doubted whether France had any spare troops to defend them or wished to make any military commitments to another state. He retired from the diplomatic service at the end of 1939.<br>
<br>Clive was characteristic of the best in the diplomatic service: reliable, modest, sensitive, but dispassionate. A devoted career diplomat, he was undeterred by the succession of difficult and frustrating posts to which he was assigned. He had many outside interests, had a gift for both drawing and poetry, and was a connoisseur of furniture, oriental porcelain, and rugs, of which he was a keen collector. He was a man of distinguished appearance, faultlessly dressed but lacking in personal vanity. His obvious interest in his fellow human beings made him a stimulating companion and inspired affection in all those who served with him. He died at his home, Cherry Orchard, Forest Row, Sussex, on 13 May 1948. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
