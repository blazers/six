<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James  fitz John</span>, thirteenth earl of Desmond  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second but eldest surviving son of John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald (also known as Sir John of Desmond), <i>de facto</i> twelfth earl of Desmond (<i>d</i>. 1536), and More, daughter of Donough O'Brien of Carrigogunnell, co. Limerick, lord of Pobblebrien. Following the death of Thomas Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Desmond, in 1534, James, together with his father, Sir John, contested the succession to the earldom with Thomas's grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9561/', "James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, de jure twelfth earl (d. 1540)")</script>. As fitz Maurice's parents were cousins, having a common grandmother, their marriage was considered by a majority of the Desmonds to be invalid, making fitz Maurice illegitimate and therefore ineligible to succeed as earl.<br>
<br>In these circumstances Sir John seized control of the earldom of Desmond in 1534, and when he died two years later James continued in possession. During this time the rebellion of Silken Thomas (Thomas Fitzgerald, tenth earl of Kildare) broke out. As they were then seeking Henry VIII's recognition for their claim to the earldom, they chose not to support the rebellion. Indeed, in January 1535 Henry wrote to James and his father thanking them for their service against the rebels, and asking for their continued support, although it is uncertain whether they did anything more than simply refuse to support Silken Thomas. Meanwhile, James fitz Maurice was still trying to gain possession of the earldom with the assistance of his father-in-law, Cormac &Oacute;g Laidhir MacCarthy, ninth lord of Muskerry. By 1536, however, having failed to garner sufficient support in Munster, fitz Maurice had gone to England where he was to remain until 1539.<br>
<br>James fitz John also had to deal with James Butler, ninth earl of Ormond (<i>d</i>. 1546), who sought to inherit the earldom of Desmond himself as husband of Joan, the daughter and heir-general of James, tenth earl of Desmond (<i>d</i>. 1529). Soon after Sir John's death in June 1536 Butler's father, Piers, eighth earl of Ormond, supporting Lord Leonard Grey, the lord deputy, captured James fitz John's castle at Lough Gur, co. Limerick, and in November James fitz John agreed to deliver two of his sons as hostages. However, it was not until March 1538 that he handed over one of his sons, a delay which both James and Grey blamed in part on the Butlers. In March 1539 James presented his claim to the earldom in a letter to Henry, but later that year fitz Maurice returned to Ireland with Henry's support.<br>
<br>By November 1539 Grey and James Butler had captured the territories of Imokilly and Kerrycurrihy in co. Cork and placed fitz Maurice in possession of them. However, fitz Maurice was killed on 19 March 1540 by James fitz John's brother Maurice, so removing the main threat to James. Thereafter his relationship with the crown improved dramatically, James fitz John being Henry VIII's only realistic candidate for the earldom, and in January 1541 he submitted to the lord deputy, St Leger. That St Leger was deputy was propitious as he was embarked on the political reform of the lordship of Ireland through the policy of indentures subsequently referred to as surrender and regrant, by which Gaelic-Irish lords formally surrendered their lands to the crown, which in turn regranted them the lands to hold in fee of the crown. Desmond's submission fitted this concept of a new beginning in the relationship with the crown, and was followed by his attendance at the Irish parliament in June 1541 when Henry VIII was made king of Ireland, once he had renounced the privilege, which his predecessors had claimed since the beheading of Thomas, seventh earl, at Drogheda in 1468, of not attending parliaments or councils. The following June he travelled to England and did homage to Henry at court. St Leger also ended Ormond's ambitions of gaining the earldom in February 1541, arranging for a future marriage between the children of the two earls as a way of defusing Desmond&#150;Ormond rivalry.<br>
<br>Desmond's <i>rapprochement</i> with Henry involved him acting on behalf of the crown, both within Munster and further afield. In August 1541 he was appointed to a commission charged with the dissolution of the religious houses in the counties of Limerick, Cork, Kerry, and Desmond (south Kerry), and later that year was praised for persuading O'Brien not to rebel. In the summer of 1543 he apprehended the white knight and Lord Roche, then in conflict with each other, and delivered them to Lord Deputy St Leger at Carlow, whence they were transferred to Dublin Castle. He contributed 120 kerne to Henry VIII's forces for service in France the following year. In 1546 and again in 1547 he was active against the O'Mores and the O'Connors. In return for this service the crown supported him, as in September 1542 when St Leger brought 400 troops to Cork to subdue MacCarthy More and MacCarthy Reagh, who were threatening Desmond's lands and the towns of Cork, Kinsale, and Youghal, St Leger taking indentures from them and other lords of the region for their future behaviour. Similarly, in October 1542 Henry nominated Aeneas O'Hernan (O'Heffernan), preceptor of the knights hospitallers' preceptory of St John the Baptist at Knockainy, co. Limerick, to the see of Emly, O'Hernan receiving letters patent on 6 April 1543.<br>
<br>Desmond's reconciliation was such that one of Edward VI's first acts in Ireland was to appoint him to the prestigious office of lord treasurer of Ireland in March 1547, and that October Edward offered to educate James's eldest son at court. The following year he was appointed admiral of the coast between Dungarvan, co. Waterford, and Galway. St Leger was to remain as deputy until May 1548, and intermittently thereafter until finally replaced in May 1556 by Thomas Radcliffe, Lord Fitzwalter, who in 1557 was created earl of Sussex. During this time Desmond fell into occasional disfavour, being alleged in August 1548 to have sworn the lords of Munster to obey him, and later that year was possibly briefly detained by the lord justice, Sir Edward Bellingham, in Dublin Castle. Desmond recovered his position following Bellingham's recall, serving in early 1551 on a commission for the establishment of order in Munster, although at this time he came into conflict with the earl of Thomond, one of James's sons being taken as a pledge.<br>
<br>Desmond enjoyed more influence under Lord Deputy Sir James Croft, being appointed to a commission for the maintenance of order within counties Cork, Kerry, and Limerick in late 1551. In December 1551 he captured his son and heir <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9556/', "Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald (c.1533&#150;1583)")</script>, and his brother Maurice, for having staged a cattle raid, and handed them over to the lord deputy. In February 1552 Desmond was suspected of membership of a group of lords who were negotiating with the queen of Scots to get Scottish troops to invade the north of Ireland. However, he survived this accusation, and towards the end of his life was back offering advice to the crown, requesting a president for Munster in March 1557, while the following February he proposed to Queen Mary a commission to inquire into the state of Ireland as a prelude to further change.<br>
<br>Desmond received numerous grants of land, including several properties upon Henry VIII's closure of the monasteries. In 1541 he received a three-year lease on St Saviour's Dominican priory at Kilmallock, co. Limerick, and in 1543 he was granted St Saviour's Dominican priory at Limerick. The same year also saw him receive a grant in tail male of lands formerly belonging to St Mary's Cistercian abbey at Dublin, this being intended as Desmond's residence while in Dublin for sessions of parliament. He was granted the manors of Adare and Croom, co. Limerick, for life in November 1546, having previously received a lease for them in 1542, these lands being forfeited by Silken Thomas. He also got a twenty-one year lease in 1550 on the monastery of the Augustinian canons at Molana, co. Waterford, along with the rectory of Mogeely which had previously belonged to the Cistercian monastery at Midleton, co. Cork. He appears to have supported the religious orthodoxy of the day, participating in Henry's dissolution of the monasteries in Munster, surviving Edward VI's more protestant reign, and witnessing the restoration of the Roman Catholic church under Queen Mary, at which time he restored some of the monasteries, including St Mary's Franciscan friary at Shandon, Cork, in October 1557.<br>
<br>Desmond was married four times; his first wife was Joan, daughter of Maurice, Viscount Roche, with whom he had a son, Sir Thomas (also known as Thomas Roe or Red Thomas). However, Joan was the granddaughter of Desmond's brother Maurice Dubh, and consequently he abandoned her and disinherited Sir Thomas. His second wife was More (<i>d</i>. 1548), daughter of Sir Mulroney O'Carroll, lord of Ely O'Carroll, whom he married before 1533, with whom he had two sons, Gerald, his heir, and Sir John, and possibly a third, Maurice, and four daughters, Joan, Margaret, Ellis, and Honora, and possibly a fifth. Desmond's third wife was Katherine, daughter of Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond, and widow of Richard, Lord Power, whom he married before February 1550; they had no children, Katherine dying at Askeaton, co. Limerick, on 17 March 1553. In 1553 he married his last wife, Ellen or Eveleen, daughter of Donald MacCarthy More, with whom he had a son, Sir James Sussex, and a daughter, Elinor. Ellen married, second, Conor O'Brien, third earl of Thomond (<i>d</i>. 1581), and died in 1560, being buried in Muckross Abbey, Kerry.<br>
<br>Although highly successful, Desmond's political recovery was a very personal one, dependent in large part on his relationship of mutual benefit with St Leger. As a result, following his death, which occurred before 31 October 1558, and his burial at the Franciscan friary at Askeaton, his son Gerald inherited an earldom with many unresolved problems which he would struggle to deal with.<br>
