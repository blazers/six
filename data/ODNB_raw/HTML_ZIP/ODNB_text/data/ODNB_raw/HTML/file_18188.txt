<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  James</span>  (1820&#150;1886), <span class="occ">politician and judge in Australia</span>, was born on 14 May 1820, at Midleton, co. Cork, Ireland, the eldest of the five children of John Martin, castle steward, of Fermoy, co. Cork, and his wife, Mary (1795&#150;1876), the daughter of a farmer, David Hennessey, of Ballynona. The family moved to Australia in 1821, his father taking employment with Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, military commander at Fermoy, who had been appointed governor of New South Wales. James Martin was educated at the Commercial Academy and by other teachers in Parramatta, then at the Sydney College, which he left at the end of 1836.<br>
<br>Precociously talented and self-confident, Martin had by then submitted articles to <span class="italic">The Australian</span> newspaper and had come to the attention of its editor, George Robert Nichols, also a prominent lawyer. Under the latter's patronage he became acting editor of the paper in 1839 and an articled clerk to Nichols in the following year. Martin wrote for other papers as well, usually being critical of the government and promoting the causes of representative government and protectionism. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1845. In 1848 he stood successfully for the Cook and Westmoreland seat on the legislative council, but was unseated on petition. He won again in 1850.<br>
<br>On 20 January 1853 Martin married Isabella (1832&#150;1909), the eldest daughter of William Long, a wine and spirits merchant of Potts Point, Sydney. They had nine sons and seven daughters. They separated in 1882.<br>
<br>In 1856 Martin was nominated to be attorney-general in the Cowper ministry, but this caused great controversy, as he was not a barrister. Part of the opposition grew from personal dislike of the &#145;vulgar fellow&#146;  (Nairn). Henry Parkes noted both Martin's &#145;absurd contempt for persons who did not agree with him&#146; and &#145;his efforts to imitate the rich and privileged&#146;  (Parkes, 80). Martin served again as attorney-general in 1857&#150;8, then in 1859 moved to the legislative assembly, on which he variously represented East Sydney, Orange, the Lachlan, and East Macquarie. In October 1863 he became premier, and proposed a protectionist programme. This was rejected by the council, and then by the public at the following election. Martin was again premier for two years from January 1866, and once more between December 1870 and May 1872. Under his leadership a number of measures to improve education and social welfare were passed. He was knighted in 1869.<br>
<br>Martin was appointed chief justice of New South Wales in 1873, once more after controversy, which &#145;nearly brought down the first Parkes government&#146;  (Rutledge, 207). Yet he grew to be well regarded for his abilities in this post, gaining, according to the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, &#145;a reputation for sagacity and ability which will not soon be forgotten&#146;  (Grainger, 149). He remained chief justice until his death, from heart disease, on 4 November 1886 at his home, Clarens, in Wylde Street, Potts Point, Sydney. He was buried at St Jude's Church, Randwick, Sydney, but was reinterred alongside his wife at Waverley cemetery in 1909.<br>
