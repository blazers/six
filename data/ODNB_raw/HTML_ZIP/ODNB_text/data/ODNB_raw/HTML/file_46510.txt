<span class="headword">Mure,  David</span>, Lord Mure  (1810&#150;1891), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 21 November 1810, the fourth of the ten children of Colonel William Mure of Caldwell, vice-lieutenant of Renfrewshire and rector of Glasgow University, and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2565/', "Sir James Hunter Blair, baronet")</script>, of Dunskey in Wigtownshire. He had two brothers and seven sisters of whom the most prominent besides himself was his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19564/', "William Mure (1799&#150;1860)")</script>, historian and Peelite MP. Mure was educated at Westminster School and then at the University of Edinburgh, where he was a member and president of the Speculative Society, and was called to the Scottish bar in 1831. He specialized in conveyancing and succession law in a modest practice which benefited from his brother's west of Scotland connections. In 1841 he married Helen Tod (<i>d</i>. 1849); they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Like his eldest brother, Mure was a conservative, but he cannot be counted as a Peelite. From 1843 to 1846, during Peel's second administration, he was one of the junior counsels for the crown in Scotland and was appointed to the same office under the Derby administration in 1852, thus showing his allegiance to the rump of the Conservative Party in the years after the split over corn-law repeal. From 1853 to 1858, however, Mure was sheriff of Perthshire, an appointment made under the Aberdeen coalition indicating that despite taking office under Derby he remained at least part-way acceptable to the Peelites and their whig allies in Scotland. He again accepted office in Derby's second administration, first as solicitor-general for Scotland from the summer of 1858, and then in the spring of 1859 as lord advocate for Scotland in succession to Charles Baillie, who became a court of session judge as Lord Jerviswoode. Mure's career is often compared with Baillie's: both came from well-established Conservative families; both became sheriffs in 1853; both were lord advocate for a short period in 1858&#150;9; and both eventually served as court of session judges.<br>
<br>Mure succeeded in narrowly winning Buteshire&#151;thanks largely to the exercise of the duke of Hamilton's influence on the Isle of Arran&#151;at the general election of 1859, and thus for the first time had a parliamentary seat to go with his new office. This, however, marked the high point of his political career. The fall of the Derby ministry in June of that year meant that he left political office for the last time after only a few weeks as lord advocate. In 1865 he accepted the office of lord ordinary in the outer house of the court of session from the whig lord advocate, James Moncreiff, with the courtesy title of Lord Mure. He thus again showed his cross-party acceptability. As a judge of &#145;first instance&#146; he was apparently successful (few of his judgments were reversed), and popular. In 1874 he was made a lord of justiciary. In the inner house of the court of session he made his mark in the period following the failure of the City of Glasgow Bank in the 1880s. He resigned from the bench in 1889.<br>
<br>Mure was a strong supporter of the established Church of Scotland, defending its control over educational provision, and was for many years an elder at St Stephen's Church in Edinburgh. He died at Bournemouth on 11 April 1891, and was buried at the Dean cemetery in Edinburgh.<br>
