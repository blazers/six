<span class="headword">Owen, Sir  Hugh</span>  (1804&#150;1881), <span class="occ">campaigner for education in Wales</span>, was born on 14 January 1804 at Y Foel, Llangeinwen, Anglesey, the eldest of the four children of Owen Owen (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;<i>c</i>.1860), farmer, and his wife, Mary (1780&#150;1862), daughter of Owen Jones, a Calvinistic Methodist leader of Llangeinwen. From 1812 he was educated for about nine years at a notable private school at Caernarfon kept by Revd Evan Richardson. In 1825 he left for London where he was employed as a clerk by W. Bulkeley Hughes, a barrister, and then by R. Vaughan Williams, a solicitor. He married in 1829 Ann Wade (<i>d</i>. 1881). In 1836 he applied for a clerkship in the poor-law commission at Somerset House and his knowledge of law so impressed the secretary, Edwin Chadwick, that he was at once appointed. In 1853 he became chief clerk, a position he retained upon the reorganization of the commission, thereafter named the Local Government Board. He was in effect the permanent secretary, representing the department at all parliamentary committees relating to the poor law, including the inquiry into the Andover workhouse scandal (1846). It is said that in preparing the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1867 Disraeli placed great reliance upon two men at Gwydyr House, the office of the poor-law board, one a Catholic, the secretary of the Statistical Society, and Hugh Owen, the nonconformist. Mrs Disraeli dubbed them her husband's &#145;guardian angels&#146;  (B. L. Davies, &#145;An assessment&#146;, 630).<br>
<br>Both before and after his retirement in November 1872 Owen attended to a wide variety of good causes, for example, the King's Cross Cabmen's Club, the London Fever Hospital, the London Welsh Charitable Aid Society, the National Thrift Society, and the National Temperance League. He was elected a member of the London school board, for Finsbury, in 1872. In 1873 he was influential in reviving the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, extinct since 1843. In 1880 his plea to place the eisteddfod of Wales upon a more secure foundation led to the formation of the National Eisteddfod Association. Within Wales he introduced measures for the education of deaf mutes (1847). Indeed, the creation of educational opportunities for his compatriots was his passion and it is upon these achievements that his reputation mainly rests.<br>
<br>Nonconformists far outnumbered Anglicans in Wales, as Owen decisively demonstrated in a census which he himself conducted (December 1846), yet, apart from Sunday schools, educational provision for their children was far inferior. Anglicans, through the National Society (1811), had established new elementary schools; the old grammar schools were firmly in their hands and they had founded St David's College, Lampeter, in 1827. The Church of England had also taken advantage of the first government grant in 1833 to be employed through the British and Foreign School Society (BFSS) and the National Society to build schools in England and Wales. In 1839 Owen was secretary to a committee for establishing British Schools at south Islington and Pentonville, near where he lived in London. In 1843 he addressed a <span class="italic">Letter to the Welsh People</span>, widely published, pressing them to establish day schools and giving clear, simple instructions in Welsh as to the most effective way of proceeding. British Schools, free from denominational affiliations, were, he said, the solution in Wales. The British Society responded to Owen's request for an agent and upon his recommendation a well-known Calvinistic Methodist minister, the Revd John Phillips, was appointed to organize schools in north Wales. In 1846 Owen became the first secretary of the Cambrian Education Society, founded as virtually the Welsh branch of the British Society. In south Wales the voluntaryist convictions of the dissenters were an obstacle, for they opposed state aid. Nevertheless, Owen succeeded in persuading the British Society to appoint in 1853 an influential Baptist minister, William Roberts (Nefydd), as its agent in the south. Gradually, in the 1850s and 1860s, the voluntaryist spirit waned and British Schools increased rapidly, in no small measure due to the unswerving support of Owen who, in 1855, was elected a member of the committee of the BFSS. When the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870 created a system of elementary schools which Owen had so long struggled to provide, agents of the BFSS withdrew from Wales.<br>
<br>It was imperative to train suitable teachers. The Borough Road College in London was a partial answer in the early days, but when the Anglican church opened two training colleges for men in Wales, Owen determined that Welsh nonconformists should not be further disadvantaged. That the Normal College, as it became known, should have been located at Bangor, and not in a populous area of south Wales, may appear strange until it is recalled that the voluntaryists in the south had failed to establish such a college, whereas the Methodists of the north were fervent supporters. Owen's dynamism in collecting funds and in organizing the campaign led to the opening of the college in 1858. Its students contributed richly to the teaching profession in Wales (and beyond). Owen was later engaged, though less actively, in establishing a college for schoolmistresses at Swansea.<br>
<br>The absence of a university in Wales caused deep concern. In 1854 Owen addressed a private meeting of prominent Welshmen in London upon the desirability of founding colleges in Wales similar to the Queen's colleges in Ireland. However, the outbreak of the Crimean War, followed by the Indian mutiny, discouraged direct financial appeals to the government. Constructive action was thus deferred until 1863 when Owen invited Thomas Nicholas, a zealot for university education in Wales, to address the social science section of the Swansea eisteddfod and later a meeting in London. Nicholas was appointed secretary and Owen one of the honorary secretaries of what may now be realistically termed the university movement. Solid financial support was, however, not forthcoming, but by good fortune the organizing committee was able in 1867 to purchase the bankrupt Castle Hotel, Aberystwyth, at a fraction of its original cost. Successive appeals to Disraeli and Gladstone for state aid failed. Nevertheless, it was resolved to open the university college in October 1872. Foreseeing the challenges which lay ahead, Owen retired from the Local Government Board. He soon concluded that a systematic house-to-house canvass and organized chapel collections were to be the basis of his mission. Thus the trim figure of Hugh Owen with his black travelling bag, waiting patiently on railway platforms or alighting from a cab, became familiar throughout Wales. In this sense he took upon himself the guise of a servant. The last Sunday in October in 1875, 1876, and 1877 was known as Sul y Brifysgol (&#145;university Sunday&#146;), an effective method of reaching ordinary people. In 1880 he analysed the various amounts the college had received, 100,000 miscellaneous sums being below half a crown. He spoke with authority, for he had counted every penny.<br>
<br>The college's finances remained parlous. A change of government in 1880 enabled Lord Aberdare to remind Gladstone that in the election campaign every candidate in Wales had pledged himself to press for the repair of the defective condition of Welsh intermediate and higher education. Owen had a large share in drafting Aberdare's letter, which ranks in importance with his own letter to the Welsh people in 1843. In July 1880 the Aberdare committee, as it is generally known, was appointed. Both the papers which Owen submitted to the committee and his oral testimony were valuable. For years he had wished to see a federal university in Wales patterned upon London University, with the power to grant degrees vested in an examining board appointed by the crown. The Prince of Wales' University, as he termed it, would consist of two colleges called the Prince of Wales' College. The university would examine any candidates who presented themselves.<br>
<br>The Aberdare report (1881) did not fully reflect Owen's views, though it recommended that there should be two university colleges in Wales, one in Glamorgan and one in north Wales. There should be a preliminary grant of &pound;4000 to each college. A future University of Wales was to be a federal university, as Owen had hoped, but not the metropolitan model for which he had persistently canvassed. Degrees were to be awarded only to those who had pursued a formal course of instruction at one of the affiliated colleges. The University of Wales was to be a federal teaching university, as came to pass in 1893. In the meantime the Welsh colleges had received state grants a few years before their English counterparts, though never the substantial sums distributed to the universities of Scotland and Ireland.<br>
<br>The zest for higher education had led to the neglect of intermediate schools. Owen recognized that it was necessary to attend to the &#145;missing link&#146;. In 1879 he was largely instrumental in forming the North Wales Scholarship Association, which enabled talented pupils to proceed beyond the elementary stage. The <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Act</span> of 1889, which gave Wales in time a network of state-aided secondary schools well in advance of England, owed much to the recommendation of the Aberdare committee, itself influenced by Owen's careful examination of the Irish precedent in 1878 when the government granted &pound;30,000 for intermediate education. Having travelled to Ireland to examine the question for himself, in a second submission to the committee he outlined a system of intermediate education more appropriate for the needs of Wales.<br>
<br>Owen died before several of his plans bore fruit. He was not without critics. A few denounced him bitterly, mainly, it appears, because of a ruthless streak not uncommon in determined men unwilling to be thwarted by the inadequacy of others. Although he was generally respected and admired, lesser figures have been more warmly regarded in Wales. Nor was he endowed with the gift of tongues in a land which prized, and perhaps unduly prized, the arts of eloquence. Today he is sometimes seen as a philistine who saw no reason to allow his native language and culture a place in his educational schemes. The content of education did not deeply concern him. In sum, &#145;he was not an educator but an organizer of education&#146;  (Williams, 77).<br>
<br>It would, however, be wrong to judge Owen out of his own time. The Welsh language was not then in peril, whereas the failure to master English was an impediment to a successful career in the professions within Britain and in its overseas empire. After the <span class="roman">Forster Act</span> of 1870 he and many others believed that there was ample provision for the working class. The prime need was to create an educated middle class in Wales, and in his evidence to the Aberdare committee he reiterated that this was the purpose of the Aberystwyth college, which, nevertheless, after his days reached down the social scale so that by 1893 it was proper to speak of &#145;the people's university&#146;. False pride did not deter him from undertaking endless laborious tasks, apparently at his own charge (he left only a modest estate). Like one of his countrymen, the first of the royal Tudors, what he minded he compassed. Towards the end of his days Owen remarked &#145;I shall never rest until the Welsh Educational Appliances are perfected.&#146; The three tiers of education in Wales, elementary, intermediate, and higher, owed more to him than to any other single person.<br>
<br>Owen was never entangled in denominational disputes. Born a Calvinistic Methodist, he became a Congregationalist after marriage; at one time he attended a Baptist church. For Roman Catholics, Cardinal Manning among them, he had respect and affection. The most familiar likeness is a photograph of him in old age. The jaw and lips are resolute, the nose firm in outline, the eyes gentle, yet shrewd, his hair silvery grey. Contemporaries recalled &#145;a beautiful face&#146;  (W. E. Davies, 2.136). Rather belatedly he was knighted, at Gladstone's recommendation, in August 1881. On 20 November 1881 he died of acute bronchitis in Menton, France. He was buried on 26 November 1881 in Abney Park cemetery, London. Of his eight children the eldest son was Sir Hugh Owen (1835&#150;1916), permanent secretary to the Local Government Board.<br>
<br>Two buildings in the University of Wales are named after him at Aberystwyth and at the former Normal College, Bangor&#151;as was the first intermediate school under the 1889 act at Caernarfon (1894). There is a bust of him by William Davies at the Royal Institution, Swansea, and a statue in bronze by Milo Griffith, erected by public subscription, at Caernarfon. His true memorial is more enduring than bronze.<br>
