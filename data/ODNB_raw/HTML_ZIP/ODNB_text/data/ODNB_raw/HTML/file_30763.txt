<span class="headword">Andrews, Sir  (William) Linton</span>  (1886&#150;1972), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born on 27 May 1886 in Hull, Yorkshire, the youngest of the four children (three sons and one daughter) of William Andrews (1848&#150;1908), author, editor, and librarian of the Royal Institution, Hull, and his wife, Jeanie Leslie Carnie (<i>d</i>. 1892). In 1895 William Andrews married Jennie Straker (<i>d</i>. 1902). Linton Andrews was educated at Hull grammar school and at Christ's Hospital, London. He wrote leader-page articles for the press while still at school. The classical master at Christ's Hospital wanted him to take holy orders, and was disappointed when he turned his back on an academic course; but he was eager to enter journalism and at sixteen joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Eastern Morning News</span> in Hull. Even so, he never lost his love of the classics.<br>
<br>From Hull, Andrews moved to Huddersfield and later to Sheffield, where he became a reporter on the <span class="italic">Sheffield Telegraph</span>. He contributed to other journals, including the <span class="italic">Globe</span> and the <span class="italic">Echo</span>, and by the time he was twenty he had saved enough to enable him to spend a year studying and working as a freelance in Paris. When he returned to England it was as a leader writer on the <span class="italic">Sheffield Evening Mail</span>. Thereafter he worked in Portsmouth, Nottingham, London, and Dundee before joining up in the first week of the First World War. Throughout that struggle he served with the 4th battalion of the Black Watch. In 1915 he married Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1958), eldest daughter of Alexander Douglas, of Dundee, director of a timber firm, and stepdaughter of James Kenyon, a grain merchant in India. There were no children of the marriage. While fighting on the western front he kept up a stream of articles as an unofficial war correspondent. His soldier's description of the battle of Neuve Chapelle won the attention of Lord Northcliffe. This led to a staff appointment on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> after the war.<br>
<br>Andrews spent five important years on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Then, in 1923, he returned to his native Yorkshire to edit the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, which had just been bought by the Yorkshire Conservative Newspaper Company, owner of the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. In his hands the <span class="italic">Mercury</span> reflected his keen interest in affairs and in the life of the region. Almost daily he wrote a personal commentary&#151;&#145;It seems to me&#146; by W. L. A.<br>
<br>Throughout the war Andrews had kept a diary, which helped to provide material for a book, <span class="italic">Haunting Years</span> (1930), a vivid account of his experiences serving with his unit through the ordeal of the battle of the Somme and the third battle of Ypres. Two light books during his years as editor of the <span class="italic">Mercury</span> were <span class="italic">Wayside Pageant</span> (1933), in which he collaborated with A. P. Maguire, and <span class="italic">Yorkshire Folk</span> (1935), an engaging analysis of the county character. After his retirement he wrote other books, including <span class="italic">Problems of an Editor</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Linton Andrews, the Autobiography of a Journalist</span> (1964).<br>
<br>In 1939 the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> was merged with the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, which had been edited with courage and distinction for twenty years by Arthur Mann. To Linton Andrews fell the task of knitting together two papers that were markedly different in style and tradition. Could the combined paper satisfy two such disparate readerships? The answer came in a circulation substantially exceeding those of both papers added together.<br>
<br>To the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, with its long record of independence of spirit, Andrews added his own personal touch: his lively response to news, his liking for people and for keeping in close contact with his readers, his fairness of mind and love of close, but never acrimonious, argument. He was conscious of the reputation the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> had gained as a great, influential paper of opinion, and he strove constantly to maintain this reputation. Two of the qualities that made him an outstanding editor were public spirit and tireless industry. He was utterly dedicated to the work of seeking out the truth and interpreting it to his readers. He watched parliamentary reports jealously to ensure that they presented the arguments used by all sides.<br>
<br>Andrews was assiduous also in keeping in touch with political leaders. In a tribute after his death Lord Butler of Saffron Walden wrote of his own frequent contacts with him over the years, and added: &#145;I knew no editor in whom I could put greater trust than Linton Andrews&#146;. Sir Winston Churchill described him as &#145;a great and justly respected editor&#146;.<br>
<br>Despite the heavy preoccupations of editorship Andrews found time to serve many good causes, regional and national. In particular, he worked strenuously for the raising of newspaper standards and the education and welfare of journalists. He was a founder of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors, of which he became president (1952&#150;3). He played a leading part in devising the scheme for the training of junior journalists; he was described as the &#145;father&#146; of this scheme. He campaigned for the establishment of a press council, and, when that council was formed, he became its first vice-chairman and later served as chairman from 1955 to 1959. Over the years he filled many other offices. He was president of the Institute of Journalists (1946), chairman of the editorial committee of the Newspaper Society (1943&#150;50), chairman of the council of the Bront&euml; Society (1940&#150;70), a member of the court and council of Leeds University (1943&#150;59), and a devoted worker for cancer research.<br>
<br>For his services to his profession and in other fields Andrews was knighted in 1954, and, a year later, Leeds University made him an honorary LLD. In 1967 he was honoured with a DLitt by Emerson College, USA. Andrews died in Leeds on 27 September 1972.<br>
