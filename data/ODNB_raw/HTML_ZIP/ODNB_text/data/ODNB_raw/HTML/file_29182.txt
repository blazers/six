<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wheatley,  Francis</span>  (1747&#150;1801), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London, the son of a master tailor of Wild Court, Covent Garden. His father first placed him under a neighbour, Daniel Fournier, a drawing-master, and later moved him to the drawing school run by William Shipley, the founder of the Society of Arts, where he received the only regular instruction of his life.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In 1762 and 1763 Wheatley won prizes awarded by the Society of Arts for youths under sixteen who drew the human figure. Instead of formal instruction he appears to have associated with other young men who were apprenticed to leading artists, but he took up his studies again when admitted as one of the Royal Academy's first students on 13 November 1769, applying also to draw at the academy of the Society of Artists on 14 December. He had exhibited for the first time at the Society of Artists in 1765, sending <span class="italic">Portrait of a Gentleman</span>, and was elected to the society on 4 September 1770; he continued to exhibit there as required for the next seven years, and became a director on 7 March 1774.<br>
<br>Wheatley derived professional advantage from his friendship with John Hamilton Mortimer, a fellow member of the Society of Artists. By copying his drawings and paintings Wheatley is said by his obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> to have &#145;acquired a style more pure&#146;, evident in his portraiture alone, for Mortimer's wiry line is not reflected in Wheatley's drawing style. The commission to paint the <span class="italic">Cascade</span> scene at Vauxhall Gardens in 1771 was probably due to the influence of Mortimer, who engaged him that same year to assist in painting the ceiling of the saloon at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, for Peniston Lamb, Lord Melbourne. Divided into compartments framed in gilt stucco, the decorations were executed in light, gay colours and symbolized Love, Time, and Fecundity, with intermediate frames containing grotesques and arabesques. Wheatley's last known decorative commission was also for Lord Melbourne, for whom Sir William Chambers built a grand town house in Piccadilly; in the finest room&#151;the saloon on the first floor which was finished by 1775&#151;the elaborate ceiling and alcoves were decorated by Giovanni Battista Cipriani and Biago Rebecca and the walls with large inset panels representing landscapes by Wheatley.<br>
<br>For the next ten years Wheatley painted landscapes in both oil and watercolour, exhibiting them regularly at the Society of Artists in London and Dublin and at the Royal Academy. The earliest known, <span class="italic">The Harvest Waggon</span> (1774; Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery) reflects Gainsborough as his source of inspiration, but he soon discarded such imaginative scenes of nature in favour of the landscape views which were the taste of the day. Dutch landscape painting with its wide open skies emphasizing the horizontal plane and its soft yellowish green and russet-brown tones became notable influences in his compositions, of which <span class="italic">The Medway at Rochester</span> and <span class="italic">View on the Banks of the Medway</span> (both 1776; Yale U. CBA) foreshadow his more popular placid renderings of places. The figures enlivening his landscapes are often very generalized, a problem he overcame on occasions by enlisting the collaboration of Mortimer, Sawrey Gilpin, and even P. J. de Loutherbourg.<br>
<br>Wheatley's watercolour landscapes, deriving from studies from nature made during sketching tours in the south of England, the Lake District, and later in Ireland, were worked up in the studio into highly finished drawings in pen and ink, lightly tinted in greys, blues, greens, and browns, as for example <span class="italic">View near Ilfracombe</span> (1778; V&amp;A). They appear to have been faithful portraits of places, sometimes with trees added to balance the composition, and peopled with small figures going about their everyday activities; a number were made to be sold as pairs.<br>
<br>Early in his career Wheatley exhibited small portraits, mostly in the fashionable medium of crayon, none of which has been identified, and soon branched out into small whole lengths in oils. In 1772 he attempted an ambitious theatrical conversation piece, <span class="italic">The Duel</span>, from <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (Manchester City Art Galleries), which was praised for its spirit and good likenesses, &#145;but upon the whole an Effect is wanted&#146;  (J. H. Mortimer and T. Jones, <span class="italic">Candid Observations on the Principal Performances now Exhibiting at the New Rooms of the Society of Artists</span>, 1772). It was from Mortimer that Wheatley learned to silhouette his sitters against a background of trees or landscape, and he imitated Mortimer's lustrous renderings of silk and satin to great effect, but Wheatley's handling was richer and more fluid, while his detailed rendering of foliage harks back to Gainsborough. The informal small whole-length portraits of the 1770s in which Wheatley gave his sitters a lively air, painting them in bright colours in a landscape setting, for example <span class="italic">Portrait of a Man with a Dog</span> (Tate collection), <span class="italic">Thomas Grimston</span> (priv. coll.), and <span class="italic">Lord Spencer Hamilton</span> (Royal Collection), soon led to commissions for conversation pieces. With his ability to paint a good likeness and to set his gaily dressed sitters before a composition of trees and distant landscape or in front of a portico, Wheatley's family groups were a fashionable formula that he continued to repeat until the late 1780s: <span class="italic">The Browne Family</span> (<i>c</i>.1779; Yale U. CBA); <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Richardson</span> (<i>c</i>.1777; NG Ire.); <span class="italic">Mrs Ralph Winstanley Wood with her Daughters</span> (1787; Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, California).<h2>
<a name="Ireland17791783"></a>Ireland, 1779&#150;1783</h2>By 1778, when Wheatley first exhibited at the Royal Academy, he had built up a good practice and was praised by the critics, but he fell in with extravagant company and was forced to flee not only his creditors but also an irate husband, the artist John Alexander Gresse. In summer 1779 he was in Dublin with Elizabeth Gresse (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1799), whom he passed off as his wife. There Wheatley quickly took advantage of the political excitement generated by the demands for free trade that gave rise to the volunteer movement and painted a large group, <span class="italic">A View of College Green with a Meeting of the Volunteers</span> (NG Ire.; engraved 1784), which brought him into prominence with the Irish aristocracy. In <span class="italic">The Irish House of Commons</span> (1780; Leeds City Art Gallery) Wheatley again captured a moment of political fervour when Henry Grattan made a famous speech on the repeal of Poynings' law before a full house and galleries thronged with fashionable crowds; his composition, for all its bright colouring and recognizable likenesses, is one of reportage. The success of these two pictures led in the early 1780s to many commissions from Irish families for large groups and informal conversation pieces both commemorating events and providing a setting for family portraits: examples include <span class="italic">Lord Aldborough on Pomposo, a Review in Belan Park, County Kildare</span> (1780&#150;81; Waddesdon Manor), <span class="italic">Review of Troops in Phoenix Park by General Sir John Irwin</span> (1781; NPG), <span class="italic">The Fifth Earl of Carlisle in Phoenix Park</span> (1781; priv. coll.). Other commissions were half-length and small whole-length single portraits, including <span class="italic">Henry Grattan</span> (1780; NPG), <span class="italic">Miss Fridiswede Moore</span> (1782; exh. Sothebys, New York, 22 May 1992).<br>
<br>Wheatley recorded the Irish landscape, particularly the beauty spots around Dublin which were admired for their picturesque and romantic situations, as in his <span class="italic">Ennischerry</span> (lost; engraving in British Museum), <span class="italic">The Hill of Howth</span> (<i>c</i>.1782&#150;1783; Southampton Art Gallery), and his views of Dublin Bay, the waterfalls of the River Dargle, and the Liffey. He also made drawings of houses&#151;for example <span class="italic">Malahide Castle</span> (1778; priv. coll.)&#151;and noted landscape views for engraving in Thomas Milton's <span class="italic">Collection of Select Views</span> and the <span class="italic">Copperplate Magazine</span>. In addition he produced lightly tinted watercolours of mountain, sea, and river, some of which he transposed into subject pictures in oil, for example <span class="italic">Salmon Leap at Leixlip with Nymphs Bathing</span> (1783; Yale U. CBA). His most immediate, and lasting, success was with the watercolour scenes of Irish rustic life, of fairs with tents and whisky-stills, of peasants, Gypsies, and fisherfolk, scenes that he continued to produce until the end of his life. But in spite of commissions for portraits and the profit from his watercolours, Wheatley again fell into debt, and his imposture in passing off Mrs Gresse as his wife was discovered. Dublin no longer being agreeable, he returned to London towards the end of 1783.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Turning to the printsellers for patronage, Wheatley's future long connection with Alderman John Boydell, the publisher and printseller, began with a commission to paint <span class="italic">The Riot in Broad Street</span> (des.) for engraving. He was one of the first artists to contribute to the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>, initiated in 1786 by Boydell to encourage history painting by exhibition and engraving. <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (1788; Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London) is a composition of elegant and graceful figures, as were his contributions to Macklin's Poets' Gallery and Bowyer's <span class="roman">History of England</span>, also set up to foster history painting. Only Wheatley's scene from <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span> (1794; Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon) is an essay in historical painting in the grand manner.<br>
<br>While Wheatley continued his practice as a portrait painter of single figures and groups, including <span class="italic">Arthur Philip</span> (1786; NPG) and <span class="italic">The Return from Shooting</span> (1788; priv. coll.), and produced a large number of fine landscape watercolours, the making of designs for engraving henceforward became the basis for his success and future reputation. His own attempts at working the copperplate, for example <span class="italic">St. Preux and Julia</span> (1786; watercolour and engraving, BM), being quickly abandoned in favour of professional engravers, Wheatley produced a wide variety of compositions of allegorical figures, of scenes from literature and contemporary poetry, of bourgeois life, as well as fancy pictures reflecting high-flown sentimental subjects in a pastoral&#150;moral vein. Stemming from the new-found sensibility of Jean-Baptiste Greuze and contemporary French printmakers, Wheatley adapted his rural landscapes and rural figures, which were based on direct observation, into softer prettified and elegant scenes of pastoral life. His work in these genres is significant as a mirror of late eighteenth-century taste and sensitivity&#151;recognized by Wheatley himself when he deposited <span class="italic">A Peasant Boy</span> as his diploma picture on his election to the Royal Academy in 1791. His series of <span class="italic">The Cries of London</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy and engraved and published in pairs from 1793, has proved his most lastingly popular work, and found a ready market on the continent.<h2>
<a name="Marriageanddeath"></a>Marriage and death</h2>Few biographical facts are known about Wheatley's career after his return from Ireland. He continued to lead the pleasure-loving life that brought about his final downfall, and was described as &#145;a handsome man, of elegant manners, and generally a favourite in genteel company. He understood his art, and spoke with great taste and precision on every branch of it&#146;  (A. Chalmers, <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span>, 1817). Probably in or before 1787 he married Clara Maria Leigh [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22529/', "Pope, Clara Maria (bap. 1767, d. 1838)")</script>], the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16385/', "Jared Leigh (1724&#150;1769)")</script>, a proctor in Doctors' Commons and landscape painter. Clara, who became well known as a flower painter, taught drawing in order to make money and help provide for their children; after Wheatley's death she married the actor and miniature painter Alexander Pope. Wheatley suffered from gout in the 1790s, becoming severely crippled by the end of the decade; this illness affected both his output and his style and his late productions are weak. His last years are recorded in Joseph Farington's <span class="italic">Diary</span>. They are a wretched story of continuous ill health and debt from 1796 until his death on 28 June 1801. He was buried in the great cemetery of St Marylebone Church, Middlesex, on 2 July.<br>
<br>Wheatley was a proficient artist technically with a fine sense of colour; he recorded eighteenth-century society in a series of accomplished portraits and conversation pieces, while three of his larger compositions are important visual commemorations of major political events of the years 1779 and 1780. He was one of the most talented designers of fancy and genre subjects, his fluent and graceful art images perfectly idealizing the sentiment of his age, unmoved by any of its deeper currents.<br>
