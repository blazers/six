<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thackeray,  William Makepeace</span>  (1811&#150;1863), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 18 July 1811 at Calcutta, the only child of Richmond Thackeray (1781&#150;1815), secretary to the board of revenue in the East India Company at Calcutta, and Anne Becher (1792&#150;1864), second daughter of John Harman Becher, a writer for the East India Company, and his wife, Harriet.<h2>
<a name="Ancestryandearlylife"></a>Ancestry and early life</h2>Harriet Becher, after the birth of Anne's younger sister (also Harriet), appears to have abandoned husband and children to elope with Captain Charles Christie under whose &#145;protection&#146; she lived until his death in 1805. She then married Captain Edward William Butler of the Bengal artillery in October 1806, John Becher, her legal husband, having died in 1800. The novelist got to know his grandmother as Mrs Butler when he stayed with her in Paris in 1834&#150;5, and when she lived with him in 1840&#150;41 and again in 1847, the year she died. She is said to have been the model for Miss Crawley in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. Anne Becher was brought up by her paternal grandmother, also Anne Becher, whose severe evangelical beliefs did not preclude ambition for a marriage of wealth and position for Anne. When Anne fell in love with Henry Carmichael-Smyth (1780&#150;1861), an ensign of the Bengal Engineers, her grandmother intervened, finally persuading Anne that the young man had died and sending the bereaved girl to India in April 1809 in the company of her sister Harriet, their mother, and Captain Butler. Anne was a beautiful woman and very successful in Calcutta social circles where Richmond Thackeray joined many others suitors, prevailing and marrying her on 13 October 1810. Her sister Harriet had married Captain Allan Graham eight months earlier. <br>
<br>The novelist's father, Richmond, second son of William and Amelia Thackeray, was born at South Mimms on 1 September 1781 and went to India at the age of sixteen to assume his duties as writer. By 1804 he had fathered a daughter by a native mistress, the mother and daughter being named in his will. Such liaisons being common among gentlemen of the East India Company, it formed no bar to his courting and marrying Anne Becher. The novelist's great-grandfather Thomas Thackeray (1693&#150;1760), headmaster of Harrow School, chaplain to Frederick, prince of Wales, and, from 1753, archdeacon of Surrey, had sixteen children. Thomas's fourth son, also Thomas (1736&#150;1806), was a surgeon at Cambridge, and one of his sons, William Makepeace (1770&#150;1849), was a physician at Chester. The youngest son of Thomas the archdeacon, also named William Makepeace (1749&#150;1813), married Amelia Richmond and fathered Richmond, the novelist's father. Amelia was third daughter of Colonel Richmond Webb, who was related to General John Richmond Webb, of Wijnendale fame, described in <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span>. The novelist chose the Webb crest of arms as his own because it &#145;was prettier and more ancient&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 3.446); and he is said to have credited the Webbs with introducing &#145;wits &hellip; into the family&#146; which was otherwise a &#145;simple, serious&#146; one  (F. Bradley-Birt, <span class="italic">&#145;Sylhet&#146; Thackeray</span>, 1911, 16). <br>
<br>Five months after William Makepeace Thackeray's birth, Richmond was promoted to the post of collector of the house tax at Calcutta and of the Twenty-four Pergunnahs, a district south of Calcutta. The family may have set up house at the collector's residence at Alipore, though Richmond's will refers to &#145;the house in Chowringhee in which I reside&#146;  (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 61). Some time in 1812 Richmond invited a new acquaintance home to dine: Captain Henry Carmichael-Smyth, Anne's supposedly deceased lover. He had been informed by Mrs Becher, who had returned all his letters, that Anne no longer cared for him. Mrs Fuller (the novelist's granddaughter) wrote, &#145;After a while the situation became so impossible that Richmond Thackeray had to be told; he listened gravely, said little, but was never the same to Anne again&#146; (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 1.cxiv; Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 63). Thackeray's fiction is dotted with accounts of parental interference in young love. <br>
<br>Richmond Thackeray died on 13 September 1815 leaving an estate worth &pound;17,000. His will directed annuities drawn from the estate of &pound;450 to his wife, &pound;100 each to his sister, Augusta, his son, William Makepeace, and his illegitimate daughter, Sarah, and about &pound;30 in total to Sarah's mother and an old servant. Young William Makepeace was sent at the age of five to England in December 1816, while his mother Anne remained to marry Henry Carmichael-Smyth in the winter of 1817&#150;18. The couple returned to England in 1819. <br>
<br>Thackeray was accompanied on his journey to England by a former colleague of his father, by his cousin Richmond Shakespeare, and by a native servant, Lawrence Barlow. When the ship stopped at St Helena, Barlow took Thackeray to see a man walking in a garden; &#145;that is Bonaparte!&#146; said the servant. &#145;He eats three sheep every day, and all the little children he can lay hands on!&#146;  (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 66). William was taken in very briefly by his aunt Charlotte Sarah (Richmond's sister) and her husband, John Ritchie.<h2>
<a name="Earlyeducation"></a>Early education</h2>In the winter of 1817&#150;18 Thackeray attended a school at Southampton<blockquote>of which our deluded parents had heard a favourable report, but which was governed by a horrible little tyrant, who made our young lives so miserable that I remember kneeling by my little bed of a night, and saying, &#145;Pray God, I may dream of my mother!&#146; (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 70)</blockquote>In the following year he entered a school at Chiswick where he remained until December 1821, after which he was enrolled at Charterhouse School. Summers he spent with the Bechers at Fareham until the return of his mother and Major Carmichael-Smyth in 1819. Though he never returned to India, the India connections of the families that made up the Fareham circle are evident in many accounts of returned East India men, including Jos in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> and Colonel Newcome in <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span>. Only one work, <span class="italic">The Tremendous Adventures of Major Gahagan</span> (1838), is set in India. Thackeray's treatment in the Chiswick school and at Charterhouse, which he attended from 1822 to 1828, may have been better than at the first school at Southampton, but his recollections of school tyrannies and the terrors of school boyhood show up repeatedly in his fiction. His portraits of Miss Tickletoby, Dr Birch, and Dr Swishtail and his descriptions of Slaughterhouse and Blackfriars schools suggest that flogging and fagging were the primary agents of instruction. His recollections were that he had been &#145;licked into indolence&#146;, &#145;abused into sulkiness&#146;, and &#145;bullied into despair&#146;  (ibid., 97). He must have felt keenly the difference between his treatment in England, even among his well-intentioned relatives, and what he had known in India where he was attended by numerous servants and played with by his mother and aunt. Among Thackeray's most convincing fictional portraits are those of young or misfit boys in school, like Dobbin in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, and of the loneliness of boys like Henry Esmond. However, the few surviving letters from Southampton and Chiswick, written under the censoring eyes of schoolmasters, do not betray the pain and misery portrayed in Thackeray's fiction. <br>
<br>Thackeray's academic achievements at Charterhouse were not outstanding, though his natural abilities caused him to rise through the ranks respectably  (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 84&#150;6). He was quite near-sighted and, having no spectacles, was unable to take a very active role in games&#151;though, apparently for the amusement of older boys, he and a schoolmate, George Venables, were put to a fight in which the latter flattened the future novelist's nose  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 2.256). <br>
<br>Thackeray spent the summers with his mother and Major Carmichael-Smyth at Addiscombe, near Croydon, until 1825, when they moved to a house named Larkbeare near Ottery St Mary and Exeter, the setting for much of <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>. The rector of nearby Clyst Hydon, the Revd Francis Huyshe, became a close family friend and was probably the model for Pendennis's would-be mentor, Dr Portman. In his final two years at Charterhouse Thackeray was a member of the first form and received &#145;instruction&#146; directly from Dr Russell, who, Thackeray complained, refused to acknowledge any of his efforts or achievements and singled him out for put-downs. Thackeray's parodies of Russell began while in school and show up in much of his fiction. In the end Thackeray's formal education was weak, including little if any mathematics and involving a rote approach to classics that did little for the understanding. But Thackeray was a voracious reader and a keen observer of his surroundings. Perhaps the most ingrained notion Thackeray carried away from Charterhouse was a sense of class distinctions; for though the public schools mixed the sons of the very wealthy with those of lesser families, there was a keen sense of community that separated those at public schools from all others. There is more than a little truth in the notion that the <span class="italic">Book of Snobs</span> was &#145;written by one of them&#146;; for though Thackeray was able to see and depict pretension and overreaching English snobbism, he never &#145;forgot his place&#146; or the codes learned in public school that separated him from less privileged men. <br>
<br>Thackeray's aunt Harriet Graham and her husband both died, leaving a daughter, Mary Graham, who from 1820 lived with the Carmichael-Smyths and as a younger sister to William. She played a Laura Bell to Thackeray's Pendennis and eventually married Colonel Charles Carmichael, the major's brother. Mary and her husband lent Thackeray &pound;500 when hard times struck in 1841, a debt that hung as heavily over him as Pen's debt to Laura in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>.<h2>
<a name="YearsinCambridgeandGermany"></a>Years in Cambridge and Germany</h2>Illness in his last year at Charterhouse, during which he reportedly grew to his full 6 feet 3 inches, postponed Thackeray's matriculation at Trinity College, Cambridge, until February 1829. Thackeray was &#145;coached&#146; for college by the well-intentioned Major Carmichael-Smyth. It was appropriate to William Thackeray's paternal family background that he should try to think of himself as a potential scholar. The Thackeray side of the family was well known for its scholars, from the archdeacon, his great-grandfather, to his great-uncles and cousins the physicians, to his cousin Elias, a vicar, and two of his cousins, the provost and vice-provost of King's College, and his cousin by marriage, a professor of political economy. Though Thackeray entered late, he was determined, perhaps under some pressure from his mother's expectations, to read for an honours rather than a pass degree. Thackeray apparently saw little of his tutor, William Whewell, but his private tutor, Henry Fawcett, found Thackeray a ready enough scholar at first. Like Pendennis, he seems to have applied himself with some enthusiasm, studying from eight in the morning to three every day, but before long he decided that private reading would suit his ends better than assiduous attendance at lectures. <br>
<br>Cambridge distractions soon eroded study time and energy, but it was not all wine parties and debates and outings. Thackeray read widely: histories (Gibbon, Hume, Smollett), modern novels and poems&#151;making a special effort with Shelley, whose <span class="italic">Revolt of Islam</span> impressed him. And he began to write. He had published a couple of poems and a translation the year before in the <span class="italic">Western Luminary</span>, a Devon newspaper, but at Cambridge his contributions to <span class="italic">The Snob</span> and, after the long vacation, to its replacement, <span class="italic">The Gownsman</span>, began to develop his talents in parody and humour. Having arrived in late February, his first contribution to <span class="italic">The Snob</span> was his famous &#145;Timbuctoo&#146;, a parody (not submitted, of course) of the prize competition, which Tennyson won that year. By mid-May he was working closely with <span class="italic">The Snob</span>'s editor, William Williams, contributing six more pieces by the end of term in June. <br>
<br>Thackeray's relatives in Cambridge welcomed him with open arms, but he found their company staid. When he applied to his cousin the vice-provost for advice about his progress toward the end of his first term, it was suggested he hold over and not take the first-year examinations. In the end he did take them&#151;five days of eight-hour exams on mathematics and classical authors. He had been sick before the exams and yet made it to the top of the fourth class &#145;where clever &#147;non-reading&#148; men were put, as in a limbo&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 1.76). <br>
<br>In the company of William Williams, just graduated and serving supposedly as Thackeray's mathematics coach for the summer, Thackeray went to Paris to learn French and extend his education with continental experience. Williams soon abandoned Thackeray, who discovered for himself museums, artists' studios, and Frascati's gambling opportunities. By the account he sent home, the first visit to Frascati's was a brush with evil that taught him the lesson to avoid gambling, whereas in truth it seems to have whetted his taste for play, which by the end of his second year at Cambridge landed him some &pound;1500 in debt. Thackeray returned to Cambridge in October, where distractions continued to outweigh the honours curriculum in maths and classics. It is not known exactly when Thackeray decided that further pursuit of an honours degree was a waste of time, but the decision formed a part of his break for independence from his mother, to whom he wrote the next year:<blockquote>You seem to take it so much to heart, that I gave up trying for Academical honours&#151;perhaps Mother I was too young to form opinions but I did form them&#151;&amp; these told me that there was little use in studying what could after a certain point be of no earthly use to me &hellip; that three years of industrious waste of time might obtain for me mediocre honours wh. I did not value at a straw[. I]s it because I have unfortunately fallen into this state of thinking that you are so dissatisfied with me[?] (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 1.138)</blockquote>Only four contributions to <span class="italic">The Snob's</span> successor <span class="italic">The Gownsman</span> and two letters home offer evidence of Thackeray's second-year activities at Cambridge. But his circle of acquaintance included important friendships with Henry Alford, John Allen, Henry Nicholson Burrows, Charles Christie, William Hepworth Thompson, and John Hailstone&#151;all members of a debating society formed in imitation of the Apostles  (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 128). His other friends included James Spedding, John Mitchell Kemble, A. W. Kinglake, William Brookfield, Richard Monckton Milnes, and Alfred Tennyson. His best friends in the autumn term were John Allen, who influenced him to affirm his religious beliefs, and Edward Fitzgerald, a shy man who shared Thackeray's love of literature and who influenced him to doubt his beliefs. Fitzgerald graduated in December, leaving the field to Allen, who lost out to faster men, including Harry Matthews, the prototype of Bloundel in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>, who seems to have led Thackeray into gambling dissipation in the Lent and Easter terms. <br>
<br>At the examinations that year Thackeray ended in the second class, dashing any hopes of an honours degree. At the Easter break he announced he would spend the vacation with a friend named Slingsby in Huntingdonshire, but instead went to Paris with Edward Fitzgerald, an outing about which, he years later remarked, &#145;my benighted parents never knew anything&#146;  (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 126). There is some evidence to believe that Thackeray contracted a venereal disease at this time. In October 1859 he wrote in a familiar strain, &#145;My old enemy gives me rather serious cause for disquiet&#151;not the spasms&#151;the hydraulics&#151;a constant accompaniment of those disorders is disordered spirits&#146; (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 4.154; C. M. Jones, &#145;The medical history of William Makepeace Thackeray&#146;, ibid., 4.453&#150;59). It is clear that he spent time in Paris with a woman ten or twelve years his senior whom he met at a masquerade ball. The experience may have been the inspiration for Pendennis's infatuation with both Emily Fotheringay, who was ten years his senior, and with Fanny Bolton&#151;with the sexual element reduced to resisted temptation. Another apparently sanitized account of the meeting with Mlle Pauline appeared in <span class="italic">Britannia</span> on 5 June 1841. Thackeray left Cambridge without a degree in June 1830.<h2>
<a name="Seekingacareer"></a>Seeking a career</h2>Thackeray's bid for independence at the age of nineteen still entailed getting permission from his mother for his next venture: an extended stay in Germany, learning the language, reading, and getting to know societies other than his own. Intending to join the English society of Dresden, he ended at Weimar for six months, dressed in the uniform of a cornetcy of Devon yeomanry obtained for him by Major Carmichael-Smyth. He reported home on falling in love with two young ladies who abandoned him for better prospects; on meeting Goethe and the intellectual circle presided over by his daughter-in-law, Ottilie von Goethe; on studying German and things in general with Dr Friedrich August Wilhelm Wiessenborn; and on reading and translating Schiller's poetry. He undertook several writing projects but placed none. <br>
<br>Thackeray illustrated Schiller's poem about Pegasus in harness, drawing the winged horse with a cart, an image to which he returned repeatedly as indicative of his own relationship to high art. In Germany, Thackeray was, for the first time in his life, free to follow his own bent, and he cut a relatively successful figure of some grace and significance. Though German philosophy may have been too heavy for him, he was already imbibing the wisdom, scepticism, tolerance, and suspended judgement of Weimar's rather relaxed society. Though still a somewhat self-centred would-be English rake, he was already showing the tendencies of mind that led him to Victor Cousin's philosophy of uncertainty, which he read in 1832  (Colby, 27) and Montaigne's amused, detached observations of life in the <span class="italic">Essays</span>, which Thackeray read and reread throughout his life. On his return to England in the early summer of 1831, Thackeray spent a few weeks at Larkbeare before taking up law studies at the Middle Temple in June. He read law, clerked, attended dinners, and disparaged his work in letters home and to Edward Fitzgerald who occasionally came up to London to roam the streets and go to plays with him. He remained in this routine for nearly a year, during which his passion for the theatre and for reading fiction and history were developed more assiduously than the law. Losing any real ambition for the law, and without entr&eacute;e to the circles of society which his expected fortune and his public school education led him to expect, he spent the year of his maturity in a variety of &#145;ungentlemanly&#146; pursuits as bill discounter, desultory journalist, and artist. His friendship with Harry Kemble that year provided more dissipation, gambling, raucous nights&#151;resulting in repeated entries in his diary vowing reform. His friendship with the editor of <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, William Maginn, dates from 1832, when Maginn took him to a &#145;common brothel where I left him, very much disgusted &amp; sickened&#146;  (Ray, <span class="italic">Uses of Adversity</span>, 156), but it is not clear that he was always to react so. <br>
<br>On coming of age on 18 July 1832 Thackeray's first business was to pay old gambling debts, a painful act which did not cure his craving for cards and dice. Nevertheless, with a fortune remaining at between &pound;15,000 and &pound;20,000, there was no reason for him to apply himself seriously to any profession that did not completely appeal to him. With the passage of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> Thackeray joined Charles Buller in the campaign for a seat in parliament from Cornwall, which he undertook in spite of his allegiance to the tories and Wellington. Thackeray next spent several months in Paris, enjoying the independence of his inheritance, casting about pleasurably but without purpose, recording feelings of guilt and unhappiness in his diary. <br>
<br>Early in 1833 Thackeray purchased the <span class="italic">National Standard</span> for which he and James Hume, as sub-editor, provided the bulk of copy. After ten months the venture ended in failure, but Thackeray had joined the Garrick Club and got to know the London literati to whom he would return after yet another venture into France to take up his next &#145;real&#146; profession: painting. His first attempt to study painting in Paris came in 1833, while he styled himself Paris correspondent for the <span class="italic">National Standard</span>, but it appears that his literary and artistic careers were both undertaken as fulfilments of pleasure by a man of some fortune. However, by December 1833 a series of bank failures in India wiped out the bulk of Thackeray's inheritance, leaving him without income. The <span class="italic">Standard</span> failed early in 1834, and Thackeray's second opportunity to study art materialized in September when his grandmother Butler moved to Paris and gave him a room. Embarking on what was supposed to be a three-year apprenticeship in the ateliers of a French artist, and thanking God for making him poor, Thackeray appears to have applied himself happily and seriously to his studies only to discover, within a year, that his talent for comic drawings would never develop into satisfactory art. This was a bitter disappointment to a man who had sacrificed a great deal of social pretension to follow a trade generally considered no better than &#145;a hair-dresser or a pastry-cook, by gad&#146;, as Major Pendennis remarks of Clive Newcome's parallel decision in <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span>. By the summer of 1835, virtually penniless, disgusted with his talent, with the vulgarity of his artist friends, with the moral degradation of his gambling cronies, one of whom committed suicide, and with his own repeated failures to reform or succeed, Thackeray's bohemian sojourn reached a nadir of depression.<h2>
<a name="Apprenticeshipandmarriage"></a>Apprenticeship and marriage</h2>But then Thackeray met Isabella Gethin Shawe (1816&#150;1893), second daughter of Matthew Shawe, a colonel, who had died after extraordinary service, primarily in India, and his wife, Isabella Creagh. Isabella was living with her mother and sister on a pension in Paris. It was unlikely that any mother would encourage such a suitor as Thackeray, who, having moved from Mrs Butler's to a dingy den, consorted with painters and gamblers, without profession or expectations. Yet his love for Isabella appears to have focused Thackeray's attention on his condition and given him a purpose and drive that had hitherto been lacking. Through a sudden new industry Thackeray determined to win and wear Isabella as his wife. With the backing of his friend John Bowes Bowes, Thackeray published his first book&#151;<span class="italic">Flore et Z&eacute;phyr</span>, a collection of captioned lithographs&#151;which gained neither attention nor money. Then his stepfather became a major underwriter for a new journal of radical politics, the <span class="italic">Constitutional and Public Ledger</span>; this enabled Thackeray, as Paris correspondent, with an income of 8 guineas a week, to propose to Isabella in April 1836, and marry on 20 August. <br>
<br>The marriage was, from all accounts, a very happy one, though beset by problems. The mother-in-law, never happy about losing her daughter, especially to Thackeray, proved a virago, serving amply as prototype for the gallery of horrid mothers-in-law in Thackeray's fiction. Then the <span class="italic">Constitutional</span> failed, leaving the future novelist&#151;now responsible for a small family&#151;without support except what could be gained by freelance writing. He took his bride to London and began ten years of heavy hack work, living from hand to mouth and suffering one domestic and financial disaster after another. Three daughters were born, Anne Isabella, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35761/', "Lady Ritchie (1837&#150;1919)")</script>, a novelist in her own right, in 1837, Jane (who died at eight months) in 1838, and Harriet Marian (&#145;Minnie&#146;, later the wife of Leslie Stephen) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59994/', "Stephen, Harriet Marian")</script>] in 1840. Jane's death, Minnie's birth, and an apparent genetic tendency brought on serious depression in Isabella. This was compounded by feelings of worthlessness as mother, wife, and housekeeper and by neglect from Thackeray; finding he could get no work done at home, he spent more and more time away, researching for his travel narratives and writing essays and stories, primarily for <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. From the demise of the <span class="italic">Constitutional</span> in July 1837 to the end of 1840 Thackeray published ninety magazine pieces and his first book, <span class="italic">The Paris Sketch Book</span>; he also signed a contract for a book in two volumes on Ireland. During the same time two books of reprints were published, though without benefit to his purse (<span class="italic">The Yellowplush Correspondence</span> in Philadelphia and a pamphlet on George Cruikshank). Perhaps this frantic activity kept Thackeray from noticing anything special about his shy wife's condition, but in mid-August 1840, on his return from a two-week trip in the Low Countries gathering materials for a guidebook never written, he was alarmed by his wife's languor and depression. <br>
<br>Two radical changes then affected Thackeray's life: he turned his attention from his work to his ailing wife, and his sense of guilt appears finally to have produced a profound effect on his personality and behaviour well beyond repeated self-recriminations in a diary. His attention to Isabella and his daughters and his acceptance of his part in creating their condition and his responsibility for their future raised his consciousness about their restraints and vulnerabilities, their worth and potential, and about the self-important self-centredness of his own life as well as that of ordinary men, his peers, whose birthright was to enjoy life and use wives and other women kinsfolk as superior servants. Beginning with <span class="italic">The History of Samuel Titmarsh and the Great Hoggarty Diamond</span> (serialized from September 1841), his narratives of young men pursuing normal courses of self-fulfilment depict more and more accurately the women who suffered and supported them. Sam Titmarsh's fortunes flare and funk, leaving him chastened and dependent on his resourceful, strong, and loving wife, whose economic contribution to the family equals her husband's. Mary Titmarsh may be based in part on Isabella, but unlike the novelist's wife she proved more resilient and sensible than her husband. Arthur Pendennis, the &#145;hero&#146; of Thackeray's second major work and the narrator of most of his subsequent books, constitutes a major study of masculine self-absorption, learning and relearning and then forgetting to understand the cruelties to women that passed as ordinary behaviour for sons, lovers, husbands, and fathers. <br>
<br>In September Thackeray took the ailing Isabella to Ireland, hoping that the company of her mother and sister Jane would help restore her spirits. During the crossing Isabella threw herself from a water-closet into the sea, from which she was eventually rescued; it was no longer possible to avoid recognition of her mental breakdown. The Irish sojourn, originally planned as a research trip for <span class="italic">The Irish Sketch-Book</span>, turned into a domestic battle with the mother-in-law from which Thackeray and Isabella fled after four weeks. In debt to his grandmother and indebted in incalculable ways to his children's nurse, Brodie, who gave up wedding plans to continue caring for the distressed family, Thackeray was also in receipt of an advance from Chapman and Hall for an Irish book which he had been unable to research or write. He returned to his parents in Paris, where he managed, over the next six months, to write ten magazine pieces, a small book (<span class="italic">The Second Funeral of Napoleon</span>), a serial novelette (<span class="italic">The History of Samuel Titmarsh</span>), and several chapters of a novel never finished (<span class="italic">The Knights of Borsellen</span>). From November 1840 to February 1842 Isabella was in and out of professional care, her condition waxing and waning, but in the long run deteriorating until she was placed with Dr Puzin at Chaillot, where she lapsed into a stable, detached condition, unaware of the world around her. <br>
<br>The experience of his mother-in-law's cruelties in contrast to the support of Brodie, his own mother, and Mary Graham Carmichael created in Thackeray deep understanding of women's capacities for cruelty, devotion, generosity, and demands. These insights are apparent in his complex portraits of women such as Amelia Sedley and Helen Pendennis, who exact dreadful tolls from the men they control through helpless love; of women like Blanche Amory, Becky Sharp, and Beatrix Esmond, who exercise control through imperious sexuality; and of women such as Ethel Newcome and Laura Pendennis, whose native intelligence and humour are the objects of male repression and societal control. All these women have secret depths, intelligence, and emotional complexities that Thackeray reveals in ways that some readers have taken to be inconsistency of characterization. <br>
<br>In the six years from the manifestation of Isabella's insanity at the end of 1840 to the start of the serial publication of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in January 1847, Thackeray published 386 magazine pieces and three books, all under pseudonyms. There are over twenty known pseudonyms, the most famous and clearly differentiated being George Savage Fitzboodle, Michael Angelo Titmarsh, Major Gahagan, Ikey Solomons, and Charles James Yellowplush. Thackeray's use of pseudonyms allowed him to develop a remarkable range of ventriloquist voices and a habit of presentation which dominated the later works, written in the person of Pendennis, an admitted <i>alter ego</i> who undergoes subtle analysis and complex criticism by the &#145;author&#146; whose defences of Pendennis are full of apparently deliberate holes. Some would argue that this is a clumsy and inept narrative technique, allowing readers to equate Pendennis with his creator and to conclude, therefore, that Pen's false starts and contradictions represent Thackeray's lack of control over his medium. To those who hold a more charitable view, that Thackeray presents an ironic vision above and beyond that of his narrator, the effect is a sense of ever-increasing narrative complexity and subtlety, a finer and sharper criticism of social conventions. <br>
<br>Having placed his wife in the care of Dr Puzin in 1842 Thackeray returned to London, leaving his daughters for the next four years with his mother in Paris. London was where he could earn by writing what was needed to support his family and make his way in the world. At first he lived in the family house at 13 Great Coram Street, which he shared uneasily with his cousin Mary and Charles Carmichael. His first contribution to <span class="italic">Punch</span> appeared, but almost immediately he undertook the long deferred research trip to Ireland, spending five months there. Though he had reviewed the Irish novelist Charles Lever rather roughly, their meeting was cordial and their friendship lasted for life. Thackeray dedicated <span class="italic">The Irish sketch-book</span> to Lever, who reviewed it admiringly in the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, though he obviously had reservations about the portrait of Ireland, and he later caricatured Thackeray as Elias Howle in <span class="italic">Roland Cashel</span>. Willingness to tilt irreverently at older, better-known novelists had already landed Thackeray in hot water with Edward Bulwer, later Lord Lytton; for in <span class="italic">Yellowplush</span> (1837) he lampooned Bulwer's inflated literary style and attributed to him grossly inflated self-aggrandizement. When the <span class="italic">Yellowplush</span> papers were reprinted in New York in 1852, Thackeray wrote a preface apologizing for the unfairness of the portrait and wrote Bulwer a letter at the same time. In 1855 a collection of Thackeray's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> published both in London and on the continent of course included the Bulwer lampoons again. Apologies aside, Thackeray never actually recanted his attitude toward Bulwer's style. <br>
<br>On his return to London Thackeray gave up the house, moving first to a hotel and then to fourth-floor lodgings in Jermyn Street. He next undertook travel in Belgium to revive the project abandoned in 1839 when he returned to find his wife in deep depression, but again the guide to the Low Countries failed to emerge. During this time Thackeray lived the life of an ineligible bachelor, frequently invited to dinners, but always on the verge of loneliness, and he revived the theatregoing, club-haunting, late-night life of his days before marriage. The only real difference was that now he was writing for his life, seriously committed to the grind of &#145;odious magazinery&#146;, driven by want and ambition. <br>
<br>Thackeray had written a short novel, <span class="italic">Catherine</span>, in 1838, published a collection of <span class="italic">Comic Tales</span> in 1840 and another novelette, <span class="italic">The history of Samuel Titmarsh</span>, in 1841, but he wanted to write a full-length novel. It had to be serialized, however, since he could not afford the time to write it all before being paid, and he had not yet convinced publishers to provide significant advances.<h2>
<a name="BarryLyndon"></a>Barry Lyndon</h2>
<span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span>, begun in January 1844 in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, was a potential novel always in danger of being discontinued. Written in the style of Fielding's <span class="italic">Jonathan Wild</span>, it represents a major advance over his early fiction in characterization, narrative technique, plot construction, and complexity of themes, but readers of <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> were apparently unprepared to distinguish easily between a ruffian's bragging autobiographical voice and that of a satirical author exposing both the egoism of the character and the chicanery of the society in which he bilked and was bilked. The narrative voice in the novel represents a brilliant ventriloquist act, demonstrating the skills Thackeray had been honing in earlier works through using a variety of well-defined pseudonyms. In writing both <span class="italic">Catherine</span> and <span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span> Thackeray was also trying to upstage the popular Newgate or crime fiction that he thought unrealistically and perhaps dangerously glamourized the lives of the criminal heroes. He particularly disapproved of Bulwer's exploitation of false sentiment on behalf of noble highwaymen. <span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span> was to have exposed the real unlikeable greed, cruelty, lack of conscience, and vulgarity of the criminal mind. Readers' understandable dislike of the narrator, Barry himself, extended inappropriately to the author, and the magazine's editors asked Thackeray to shut the story down after ten instalments. <span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span> remains, however, a critically acclaimed and highly regarded first novel. It is the story of an Irish lad who grows up with a colossal ego and quick temper, who fights duels, cheats at cards, suffers repeated well-deserved set-backs in the English and then the Prussian army, and rises to wealth through a fortune-hunter's marriage, after which his cruelties to his wife and his stepson are not redeemed by his maudlin sorrow for the death of his own son. Ending in prison, he pens his memories, appealing without self-consciousness for sympathy and admiration. <br>
<br>One reason why Thackeray was willing to shut <span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span> down was that in August, at three days' notice, he undertook a three-month trip to the Mediterranean with stops in Spain, Greece, Turkey, the Holy Land, and Egypt, recounted in frequent essays &#145;From our fat contributor&#146; in <span class="italic">Punch</span> and more meditatively in <span class="italic">Notes of a Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo</span> (1846). Comical recollections survive of Thackeray's severe difficulties in writing <span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span>, &#145;Fat contributor&#146;, and <span class="italic">Cornhill to Cairo</span> while fighting bedbugs and seasickness. The cockney's view of the world, a chief element in his Paris and Irish travel books, dominates the writing; for Thackeray acknowledged to himself that visitors bring as much of their view of the world with them as they find on their travels, and he eschewed pontification. Back in London, in April 1845 he moved to slightly better bachelor quarters in St James's Street, where he was visited by his mother and children in June. And in October he had Isabella, now thought to be incurable, installed in Camberwell with a Mrs Bakewell, in whose care she remained for the rest of her life. One more move, in June 1846, to Young Street, put Thackeray in a house to which he invited his parents and to which he brought his daughters to stay. His parents, however, chose to remain in Paris out of the reach of the major's London creditors, though Thackeray paid the debts in 1848, clearing the way for their return to England when they chose. <br>
<br>Although Thackeray continued to contribute heavily to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> and regularly to the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, <span class="italic">Punch</span> was increasingly in the 1840s his periodical affiliation. The magazine's weekly staff dinners were important in his life until he resigned in December 1851 over differences with the editors and with his chief staff rival, Douglas Jerrold, about editorial policy in treating political issues, particularly Catholic emancipation and the character of Louis Philippe. <span class="italic">Punch</span> published his next two major works, which gained him genuine first-class popular standing and prepared the way thematically for <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. The first was a comprehensive and exhaustive analysis of &#145;The Snobs of England. By one of themselves&#146; (March 1846 to February 1847); the other was a series of parodies of the novelists G. P. R. James, Charles Lever, Mrs Gore, Edward Bulwer, Benjamin Disraeli, and James Fenimore Cooper, entitled <span class="italic">Punch's Prize Novelists</span> (April to October 1847).<h2>
<a name="Majornovelsandrelationswithpublishers"></a>Major novels and relations with publishers</h2>Nothing Thackeray had written thus far, however, quite prepared readers for the panoramic scope, protean voice, or seriousness of comic vision incorporated in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, begun in January 1847 and running for nineteen months as the first publication to bear the name William Makepeace Thackeray on the title-page. Of all Thackeray's works <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> is the one that has been most discussed and most frequently adapted for stage and film. It is almost always cited as his best work, though some readers and critics give <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span> that honour. <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> chronicles the rise and fall of Becky Sharp's fortunes, the fall and rise of Amelia Sedley's fortunes, and the roles played in their lives by a variety of men. George Osborne, a young &#145;padded booby&#146;, as Becky says, who loses his inheritance by marrying Amelia, but then wishes to run away with Becky, is killed at the battle of Waterloo and mourned for fifty chapters by the silly Amelia. Rawdon Crawley, a not too bright but basically good-hearted soldier who loses his inheritance by marrying Becky, ends by reluctantly accepting the governorship of an island in exchange for his wife's honour. In the wings is William Dobbin, awkward, devoted, and the only true gentleman in the book who finally &#145;wins and wears&#146; Amelia, though he seems aware that the pay-off is not worth the effort. The subtitle, &#145;A Novel without a Hero&#146;, gives ample warning that there are no very intelligent, very elegant, very noble, or very admirable characters in the book; it does not, however, advertise the brilliance, dexterity, humour, skill, or intelligence of the narrator&#151;or, rather, narrators. Although Thackeray does not use the first-person form with a named narrator, the presence of a story-teller with a chameleon's colouring and a showman's skills is inescapable. Unlike many Victorian novelists with palpable narrators who frequently intrude in the story to make sure the reader is &#145;getting it&#146;, the narrator of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> appears to toy with the reader, offering obviously erroneous and contradictory directions; the reader must therefore accept responsibility for pointing morals, if any, independently of the comic untrustworthy narrator. <br>
<br>Thackeray's primary publishers in the 1840s had been Chapman and Hall who, besides the Irish and Mediterranean travel books, published four Christmas volumes. It is rumoured that <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> was turned down by five or more publishers before Bradbury and Evans, the proprietors of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, agreed to publish it in the same format and style that they used for their star author, Charles Dickens. Though the novel's initial print run and sales were under 5000 copies, and though Thackeray complained that popularity did not match critical success, 1847 proved a watershed year, separating Thackeray's struggling hack work from the success that brought publishers begging to his door. He made &pound;1200 plus a share of profits from <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, and each novel thereafter earned him more than the previous one until the last years of his life when his income exceeded &pound;7000 a year. Bradbury and Evans subsequently published Thackeray's three other major serial novels: <span class="italic">Pendennis</span> (1848&#150;50), <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span> (1853&#150;5), and <span class="italic">The Virginians</span> (1857&#150;9). <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Pendennis</span>, a twenty-three-month serial, begun in August 1848 but interrupted for three months at the end of 1849 because of Thackeray's nearly fatal illness (most probably cholera or typhoid), chronicles the youth, education, and launched writing career of Arthur Pendennis, son of a country squire, formerly an apothecary. Four major episodes in Arthur's life drive the plot: his first innocent, passionate, hopelessly absurd passion for an actress, the Fotheringay, much older than himself; a second, somewhat cold-blooded play-acted love passage with Blanche Amory, more suitable by education and social status but artificial in manners and character; there follows Arthur's briefly glorious and ultimately ignominious career as a college student at Oxbridge; and then a third, tawdry and nearly tragic liaison with a porter's daughter, Fanny Bolton. In <span class="italic">Pendennis</span> Thackeray used a limited omniscient narrator who plays very few of the narrative games employed in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. And though many critics have found easy parallels between Arthur's biography and that of the author, it seems clear that Pendennis, who in the main has a love of truth and hatred of lies, is yet the world's worst at remembering lessons learned. Though Pendennis is rewarded at the end by marriage to his childhood playmate, Laura Bell, there is much to suggest that Thackeray is already shifting his satirical and critical mode and gaze from the obvious vanities and hypocrisies of society to the subconscious, more habitual injustices and cruelties of conventional behaviour, particularly as played out in domestic circles between husbands and wives, parents and children, and among siblings. Pendennis, who lacks the ability to see such subtleties, is chosen narrator for two later novels (<span class="italic">The Newcomes</span> and <span class="italic">The Adventures of Philip</span>), in which he plays the role of wise, observant arbiter of intelligent common sense and good intentions; time and again, however, Thackeray exposes the narrator, Pendennis, for the insensitive boor that he is. Thackeray's apprenticeship in this type of narration began with the pseudonymous works of his youth. The only difference between Barry Lyndon and Arthur Pendennis is that Pendennis is well mannered, polite, educated, and conventionally married to a conventional woman. But he is just as egotistical, self-centred, self-satisfied, and content in his male-dominated world as was Barry. <br>
<br>The major force in Thackeray's writing career was his third publisher, George Smith. In his first approach in 1849 Smith offered Thackeray &pound;1000 for his next book, sight unseen, but Thackeray was already committed and counter-offered a Christmas book, <span class="italic">The Kickleburys on the Rhine</span>. In 1852 Smith signed the novelist to a contract for a novel in three volumes, stipulating that he could publish nothing else in the six months before or after publication. Smith, known as the prince of publishers, was generous with his money and ruthless in his control. Thackeray, who from 1847 to 1851 had averaged fifty-nine magazine publications a year in addition to two major serials, in 1852 had but one publication, <span class="italic">The History of Henry Esmond</span>. <br>
<br>It is on <span class="italic">Esmond</span> that Thackeray's fame as a historical novelist primarily rests. The first, three-volume edition was printed in an antique typeface and with antique spelling. Set during the reign of Queen Anne, the novel focuses attention on the English revolution and on the conflicts over succession caused by William III and Anne having no surviving children. Like Barry Lyndon, who writes his life's history while in prison at the end of his life, the narrator and main character, Henry Esmond, writes his memoirs in the twilight of his years on his estate in Virginia, a property he came to after all the events worth telling about his life have taken place. Orphaned, one might say, three times, Henry grows up vulnerable and sensitive to slights and grateful for attention. He adores his first spiritual leader, the Jesuit Father Holt; but his allegiances turn protestant under the priest's successor, Rachel Castlewood, who for at least the first quarter of the novel plays the role of mother in his life. A man of loyalties, Henry waxes political in college, goes to war, and serves the Jacobite cause, not so much because of personal convictions, readers are led to believe, but in order to impress Rachel's daughter Beatrix. The novel is both controversial and psychologically subtle and complex because it is clear that Rachel Castlewood, though married to Lord Castlewood and playing the mother role, is in love with Henry by the end of the first volume. Clearly Henry does not know that, and, perhaps as clearly, Rachel is in denial, even after the death of Lord Castlewood. But after spending all of volume two and most of volume three in love with Rachel's daughter Beatrix, Henry finally recognizes the daughter for the vixen that she is and declares for and marries the mother, retiring to Virginia. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about Henry's life is his successive discoveries that what he thought was true, wonderful, and good proves to be false, disappointing, and even evil. Truth, he seems to conclude, is very elusive and naught but grief comes from accepting the truths of others. However, even the truth of self-reliance seems uncertain in this novel, where Thackeray once again plays off the narrator's insights against the reader's suspicions, giving readers one of the most thought-provoking and unsettling among Victorian novels. Thackeray's amateur knowledge of the period was so extensive that he contemplated writing a history in the style of Macaulay's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, and he was asked by a publisher to edit a multi-volume correspondence of Horace Walpole. <br>
<br>However restrictive, the contract with Smith for <span class="italic">Esmond</span> said nothing about delivering lectures, and Thackeray had already planned a series on eighteenth-century English humorists, which he began delivering in London and other major cities in England and Scotland, making more money from them than from his occasional writings in previous years. On publication of <span class="italic">Esmond</span> he took his lecture tour to America for five months, visiting New York, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington (where he dined with outgoing President Millard Fillmore and incoming President Franklin Pierce and lobbied on behalf of international copyright), Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah. The lectures were published in England as soon as the contractual time of silence expired. On a second tour of America two and a half years later he lectured on the four Georges, adding Albany and Buffalo to the itinerary in the north and Mobile, New Orleans, St Louis, and Cincinnati in the south and west. Thackeray's wealth was accumulating, and he invested in railways on both sides of the Atlantic and in the transatlantic cable, demonstrations of which were thought promising in the 1850s, though the first success came three years after Thackeray's death. <br>
<br>Thackeray's encounters with American publishers, who had republished his early work at will, were remarkably different from those by Charles Dickens and later Anthony Trollope who both lost their tempers over their lack of control of American publications. Thackeray, acknowledging that half a loaf was better than no loaf, laughed and befriended James Fields in Boston, George Putnam in Philadelphia, and, in New York, the Appletons and the biggest pirates of them all, the Harper Brothers&#151;negotiating courtesy contracts and recording his unpleasant thoughts on the matter of authors' rights only in letters home. <br>
<br>Under their previous contract Bradbury and Evans published <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span>, another twenty-three-month serial that began in July 1854. It chronicles the affairs of a &#145;most respectable family&#146; of merchants, bankers, and petty aristocrats. The respectability is primarily one of manners and appearances, and the novel reveals in great detail intense intra-family jealousies, rivalries, fights, and outward politeness. The central character is, ostensibly, Clive Newcome, who plays at becoming an artist and plays at aspiring to the hand of his very elegant cousin Ethel Newcome, but whose pliable nature and lack of ambition nearly destroy his attractiveness as a handsome, well-intentioned, charming young man. A major role is also played by Clive's father, Thomas, the East Indian merchant and half-brother to the establishment Newcomes. Thomas, indulgent of Clive to a fault, presses his son to marry Rosie McKenzie (who brings along her termagant mother), though Clive is never in love with her. Thomas is, however, in love with Rosie and appears to live out his own youthful failure to marry the girl he loved through the marriage he arranges for his son. Although the novel is on its surface about the men, it is easy to see that <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span> is a major exploration of the marriage market (particularly through Lady Kew's efforts to find an appropriately wealthy buyer for her niece, Ethel) and of the cruelties and injustice of the role of women in Victorian society. One reaches this conclusion, for the most part, by ignoring the opinions expressed by Pendennis, the narrator, and seeing the reality of the situations described. Thackeray paints a remarkably sympathetic portrait of Clara, who marries the tyrannical and abusive Barnes Newcome and then runs away with Jack Belsize. That the decision to break her marriage vows is a traumatic experience for Clara is abundantly clear, but that she is fully justified in taking her situation into her own hands in a country with no laws to protect her is equally clear.<h2>
<a name="Familylife"></a>Family life</h2>The result of Isabella's illness was that Thackeray lived the rest of his life as a <i>de facto</i> widower, though unable to remarry or have any &#145;normal&#146; relationship with a woman. His letters show that he developed an extraordinary number of confidential relations with women who were emotional supports to him. Most remarkable among his relationships were two which threatened or promised to be more than friendships: the first with Jane Octavia, the wife of his close college friend William Brookfield; the second with Sally Baxter, an American girl twenty years his junior. The first relationship had all the potential for a serious affair, but was kept under a strict restraint that exacerbated the emotional pressures. Having given up hope of a cure for Isabella, Thackeray and Jane&#151;a partial invalid apparently troubled by doubts about her husband eleven years her senior&#151;began a friendship that could have been innocent enough. Though much of their correspondence was destroyed or snipped, it is clear that the &#145;brother sister&#146; love under which they conducted their relations threatened to boil over in 1851, when William Brookfield finally barred Thackeray from further visits to or correspondence with Jane. Thackeray, declaring his aggrieved innocence, nursed his bruised ego vicariously in <span class="italic">The History of Henry Esmond</span>, which he had just begun, chronicling the demise of the loveless marriage of Frank and Rachel Castlewood and the latter's suppressed and initially unacknowledged love for Esmond. Thackeray may have indulged a modicum of revenge in having Esmond displace his love for Rachel on to her daughter Beatrix, a &#145;betrayal&#146; Rachel perforce suffered in silence. Be that as it may, the emotional trauma of the Brookfield relationship, like that of his wife's mental breakdown, left Thackeray not only more melancholy but wiser and tenderer in his understanding of both men and women and of thwarted desires. <br>
<br>The second relationship&#151;with Sally Baxter, whom he met while visiting Mr and Mrs Baxter during his stay in New York in 1852&#151;was far more playful, though Thackeray wrote to his mother, of all people, about his surprise and pleasure in discovering, at his age, that the foolish emotions of young love were still available to him. Though again in New York in 1855, when Sally married Frank Wade Hampton of South Carolina, Thackeray declined to attend, apparently because of real though of course unjustified feelings of jealousy. <br>
<br>Thackeray's confidantes included Mrs Anne Procter, who had been a principal support to him in his troubles with Isabella and to whose husband, Bryan Procter (Barry Cornwall), he dedicated <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. More important were Jane Elliot and her unmarried sister Kate Perry, whom Thackeray met while writing <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in 1846. Their friendship, by Kate's account, sprang up &#145;like Jack's bean stalk in a pantomime, which rushed up sky high without culture; and, thank God, so remained till his most sad and sudden end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 1.cxxv). These two ladies were true confidantes, bolstering Thackeray during his emotional involvement with Jane Brookfield and in the trials and challenges of single parenting. With many other women, to whom less intimate letters survive, Thackeray developed social friendships that apparently thrived on his charming, gallant, but utterly safe status as a &#145;single man&#146; who was married. The condition lent piquancy and restraint to relationships that supplied his genuine need for and interest in feminine companionship. <br>
<br>While <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span> was being written Thackeray and his daughters moved to Onslow Square, Brompton, in May 1854, after nine years at Young Street. Thackeray's plan to provide his parents with a home in his own house was abandoned after a four-month experimental visit in 1857, and another house was found for them two years later. Henry Carmichael-Smyth was a complex, energetic, somewhat eccentric, and erratic character, constantly developing schemes for investments and inventions, which Thackeray found irritating. And his mother, whose love always entailed a demand for some control and for conformity to her religious views, was easier to deal with in small doses and at a distance. A remarkable exchange of letters with his mother and daughter includes stern reproaches to the grandmother for attempting to indoctrinate Anne and Minnie in her strict beliefs during Thackeray's visit to America in 1852  (see <span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 3.85&#150;7, 93&#150;6, 140&#150;41, 4.168&#150;70). Anne was fifteen by then, shared many of Thackeray's liberal ideas, and was highly critical of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>&#151;or at least of the prevailing interpretations of an angry avenging God. But Thackeray wished to live at peace with his mother, and most biographers claim that he never really achieved full independence from her influence, though it exerted itself only in her presence and in her relatively narrow sphere. <br>
<br>Thackeray doted on his daughters and had a special affinity with Anne, who, he was afraid, was &#145;going to be a man of genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 2.240). His fears did not prevent his employing her as a secretary, her handwriting appearing in the manuscripts from <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span> onwards. Nor did he stand in the way, though he did not take a positive hand, when Anne submitted a story anonymously to Smith for the <span class="italic">Cornhill</span>, and he failed utterly to conceal his pride when it was accepted. He both feared that Anne and Minnie would be unable to secure husbands and feared that they would. They focused his energies from their birth to his own death, for he frequently said that all his work was aimed at restoring his lost patrimony. In March 1860 Thackeray purchased 2 Palace Green, Kensington, and after having it completely rebuilt, the family moved in during March 1862. When his house, furnishings, wine, books, and copyrights were sold in 1864 after his death, each girl received nearly &pound;10,000. Major Carmichael-Smyth died in 1861; Mrs Carmichael-Smyth died in 1864.<h2>
<a name="Literaryrelations"></a>Literary relations</h2>From the time Thackeray joined the Garrick Club in 1833, clubs featured prominently in his social life. Even when he was hardest at work, he seldom wrote in the evening, when he usually dined out in the home of friends or at a club. Talk was a necessary ingredient of Thackeray's &#145;research&#146; for his writing, and he made acquaintances wherever he travelled. The Garrick and the Reform were his favourite clubs, though he belonged to the Athenaeum, the Century (in New York), and to several debating societies like the Eccentric, the Shakespeare, and the Rationals. Of Thackeray's writing friends Francis Sylvester Mahoney (Father Prout), Bryan Procter (Barry Cornwall), Jack Sheehan, and Jacob Omnium figure most pleasantly in his letters. He worked closely with illustrators George Cruikshank, John Leech (a friend since Charterhouse days), Richard Doyle, and Frederick Walker. <br>
<br>Thackeray's relationship with Charles Dickens has been controversial among critics since the 1840s, no critic able to refrain from championing one side or the other. Although in an often repeated lecture for charities Thackeray praised Dickens in fulsome terms for four pages, he could not stop himself from adding &#145;I may quarrel with Mr. Dickens's art a thousand and a thousand times, I delight and wonder at his genius&#146;  (&#145;Charity and humour&#146;, <span class="italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span>, 7, June 1853, 88). Privately he objected to Dickens's overblown writing style, and he remarked once that Dickens was cool to him because he had &#145;found him out&#146; as a poseur. And though Dickens wrote a moving memorial full of praise for Thackeray, published in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> just a month after Thackeray's death, he could not refrain from saying that &#145;We had our differences of opinion. I thought that he too much feigned a want of earnestness, and that he made a pretence of under-valuing his art, which was not good for the art that he held in trust&#146;  (February 1864, 130). They were too different and too similar to ever really like each other. <br>
<br>At first Thackeray got on fairly well with Dickens's chief supporter, John Forster, though he caricatured him in his letters to friends&#151;a circumstance that became known to Forster, who of course objected, with Dickens acting as his second. In 1847 club gossip led to a flare-up over Forster's supposed remark that Thackeray was &#145;false as Hell&#146;, but after a reconciliation it was Forster who brought Dr Elliotson to Thackeray when he fell seriously ill in 1849. A remark three months later in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>, however, opened the famous &#145;dignity of literature&#146; controversy that revealed the deep rifts in thought, temperament, and&#151;one would have said at the time&#151;breeding that separated Thackeray from Dickens and Forster, whose claims to social status rested entirely upon their literary efforts. Thackeray, on the other hand, had family ties that bestowed status apart from his literary reputation. Comments by Forster on the desirability of state support for artists and against the passage in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>, which Forster said disparaged the profession of writing, led to a response by Thackeray and counters by Forster (the relevant documents are reprinted in the <span class="roman">Garland</span> edition of <span class="italic">The History of Pendennis</span>, New York, 1991). Another reconciliation ensued, but soreness remained. Then in May 1858 rumours spread about Dickens's separation from his wife, Kate, and Thackeray contradicted one rumour about Dickens's having an affair with his sister-in-law Georgina by blurting out &#145;no such thing&#151;its with an actress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 4.86). Dickens, when he heard the story, thought Thackeray was spreading a tale of him and an actress&#151;which, though true, was not his business to discuss. This episode was still rankling in each author's thoughts when the famous &#145;Yates affair&#146; broke out a month later. Young Edmund Yates published an unflattering description of Thackeray, questioning his honour and veracity, to which Thackeray objected. Dickens and Forster stood by Yates, who was nevertheless deprived of his club membership at the Garrick and subsequently lost appeals to the club membership and in court. No further connection was made between the two novelists until, the week before he died, Thackeray approached Dickens on the steps of the Reform Club and shook his hand. <br>
<br>Thackeray's normal relations with his writing colleagues were cordial, but the differences with Douglas Jerrold over the virulence of <span class="italic">Punch</span> satire did not end with Thackeray's resignation from the staff in 1851: in an 1855 <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> essay on the drawings of his old friend John Leech, Thackeray remarked off-handedly that <span class="italic">Punch</span> without Leech would be worthless. The remark, meant to praise Leech, naturally offended the rest of the staff. Thackeray's success led to renewals of school friendships with members of the aristocracy such as Lord Houghton (Richard Monckton Milnes), and he made many new friends among the social &eacute;lite. These have fuelled the notion that he disparaged his profession to curry favour with the upper classes, an idea he denied and which, though still widely accepted, withstands little scrutiny.<h2>
<a name="Laterworksandfinalyears"></a>Later works and final years</h2>Though Smith made offers for the remaining large serials, Thackeray remained with Bradbury and Evans for one more novel. <span class="italic">The Virginians</span> (1857&#150;9) is a sequel to <span class="italic">Esmond</span>, and recounts the adventures of Henry Esmond's grandsons in the period of the American War of Independence. But then <span class="italic">The Virginians</span> failed to earn expected profits (it is not true that the publisher lost any money), and Thackeray felt free to switch publishers. Early in his career Thackeray had made a bid to be editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, and in the mid-1850s he had proposed a periodical to George Smith and then withdrawn; so it is not very surprising that Thackeray readily agreed to edit Smith's <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, which began publication in January 1860, or that he took his duties seriously&#151;agreeing to read all submissions, writing prospectuses and letters of acceptance and rejection, though drawing the line at reading proofs for any but his own writings. Thackeray did much of the work at home with the help of an amanuensis and a courier for messages to and from Smith's office and home. The work was onerous and demanding enough to occasion friction between editor and publisher, but the letters show a deep personal regard and respect between the two. Thackeray sponsored Smith's nomination to the Reform Club, and the families exchanged social visits, particularly after Smith's marriage. <br>
<br>Smith's contract with Thackeray to edit the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> was tied to others under which Thackeray contributed fiction&#151;<span class="italic">Lovel the Widower</span> (1860), <span class="italic">The Adventures of Philip</span> (1861&#150;2), and <span class="italic">Denis Duval</span> (1864)&#151;and editorial essays (<span class="italic">The Roundabout Papers</span>). This prevented him from writing for any other publisher the rest of his life; Smith even prevented Thackeray from offering a short piece to <span class="italic">Punch</span> as a conciliatory move. <br>
<br>Thackeray's later fiction is seldom written about and less often admired. <span class="italic">The Adventures of Philip</span> adopts again Arthur Pendennis as narrator to chronicle the story of a not terribly brilliant, not terribly industrious, not terribly sensitive young man's struggle through adversity, including a corrupt and sycophantic father, to success in a writing career and in love. Philip's story follows a trajectory similar to Thackeray's own life, but the interest of the story must lie in finding Pendennis to be an unreliable narrator whose expressed values and approbation of characters is frequently insensitive in ways of which Thackeray must have expected readers to disapprove. Many readers, unwilling to grant this view, find the later novels weak, bland, and tedious in spite of the smooth dexterity of Thackeray's writing style. <span class="italic">Lovel the Widower</span> is a fictional reworking of a play, <span class="italic">The Wolves and the Lamb</span>, and is frequently seen as a filler that Thackeray produced to fulfil his contract with George Smith. Returning to historical fiction with <span class="italic">Denis Duval</span>, which was truncated at his death, Thackeray set his last novel among the French Huguenots in England in the latter half of the eighteenth century. Both <span class="italic">Esmond</span> and <span class="italic">Duval</span> are first-person narrations requiring what would appear to be a first-hand knowledge of current events at the time. The first editor of <span class="italic">Denis Duval</span>, appending comments to the unfinished book, remarked on the care with which Thackeray prepared his work, referring to his<blockquote>many most careful notes, and memoranda of inquiry into minute matters of detail to make the story true. How many young novelists are there who haven't much genius to fall back upon, who yet, if they desired to set their hero down in Winchelsea a hundred years ago for instance, would take the trouble to learn how the town was built, and what gate led to Rye (if the hero happened to have any dealings with that place), and who were its local magnates, and how it was governed? And yet this is what Mr. Thackeray did though his investigation added not twenty lines to the story and no &#145;interest&#146; whatever: it was simply so much conscientious effort to keep as near truth in feigning as he could. (<span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, 9, June 1864, 656)</blockquote>Thackeray was a large man, 6 feet 3 inches, and weighing over 15 stone. His height kept him from looking rotund, but his round face with its flattened nose, near-sighted squint, and high forehead lent itself to self-caricature. As a young man he affected a monocle and later signed many of his drawings with a pair of spectacles with crossed temples. By the age of forty he had white hair, parted on the left and worn over his ears and collar. The fullest recorded description of his appearance occurs in Edmund Yates's unpleasant lampoon, but a number of photographs and drawings show him in the typical unsmiling Victorian dignity which was required by long exposure times and which belied the constant humour of his writings from beginning to end. His health worsened during the 1850s and he was plagued by the recurring stricture of the urethra that laid him up for days at a time. He worsened matters by over-eating and drinking and avoiding exercise, though he enjoyed horseback riding and kept a horse. <br>
<br>On 23 December 1863, after returning from dining out and before dressing for bed, Thackeray suffered a stroke and was found dead on his bed in the morning. His death at the age of fifty-two was entirely unexpected by his family, friends, and reading public. An estimated 7000 people attended his funeral at Kensington Gardens. He was buried on 29 December at Kensal Green cemetery.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>From the publication of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in 1847&#150;8 to the First World War Thackeray's reputation grew steadily. Never the best-seller that Dickens was, he was more highly regarded than Dickens by readers such as Charlotte Bront&euml; and Jane Welsh Carlyle and by reviewers like Robert Bell and Lady Eastlake. From the beginning, however, there were detractors who preferred writers whose characters were less ambiguous and whose grasp of moral conventions was more comfortable. <br>
<br>Charles Dickens and other critics such as John Forster (Dickens's first biographer), Michael Sadleir (in his biography of Bulwer-Lytton, 1931) and, more recently, John Carey (<span class="italic">Thackeray: Prodigal Genius</span>, 1977) have thought that Thackeray had a thin skin, being able to dish out but not receive criticism, and that this characteristic revealed itself significantly as an uneasy social position in English society, which, after <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, lionized him as a writer but distrusted him as an outsider with bohemian connections. The result, such critics aver, was to tone down his satire against the upper classes, with whom in his later years he allegedly curried favour. <br>
<br>A very different view cites evidence that Thackeray's pedigree, particularly on his father's side&#151;a family of professionals, doctors, academics, and clergy as well as East India officials with sufficient family wealth to pay for public school and a Cambridge education&#151;ushered him with some grace and comfort into the manners of the upper classes. It is a view that acknowledges Thackeray as a thinker whose experiences and philosophy led to a profound change of heart and mode of thinking from an ordinary privileged young man to a sensitive and hurt but keen-eyed observer of social and domestic injustices. It was less the success of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> and the responsibilities of single parenthood and much more the thoughtful incorporation of Comte's positivism and Victor Cousin's tolerance and eclecticism that informed the subtle exposure of ordinary greed and insensitivity in the male-dominated society and legal system that was England in the 1850s. <br>
<br>Thackeray was capable of exposing the hypocrisy of conventional socially acceptable behaviour, but he had an unusual capacity to distrust his own and other people's best views. His ability to create detailed realistic images combined with an ability to detect sham or self-deception in the best-intentioned acts led one reviewer to compare Thackeray to a fly settling on a good dinner. Readers of a more philosophical bent appreciated his reluctance to impose a moral imperative. He was a man of principles and honour whose sense of guilt about his self-indulgences was balanced by a sense of honesty in acknowledging his appetites. His own and his characters' moral dilemmas and self-directed humour have endeared and repelled readers, according to their tastes, from the beginning. <br>
<br>Biographers accounting for Thackeray's development as a writer, whether they think of the later works as a decline or as more subtle and complex narratives and social criticism, generally point to major turning points: Thackeray's marriage and loss of one child and then of his wife (1836&#150;44), the success of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (1847&#150;8), the nearly fatal illness during the writing of <span class="italic">Pendennis</span> (1849), and the break with the Brookfields (1852). Without a doubt Thackeray was changed by these events, but it is not obvious that he increasingly became the complacent toothless lion and bland purveyor of harmless fiction&#151;as argued by critics who prefer the biting, rollicking satire of the early works culminating in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. It has been argued that with time he became a shrewder, more subtle, and more philosophical exposer of the ordinary treacheries of conventional society. <br>
<br>Thackeray stands alone among male Victorian novelists in the estimation of feminist critics in the last quarter of the twentieth century who delighted in reading against the grain of Victorian conventions on gender and found Thackeray subtly in harmony with their criticism of those conventions. <br>
<br>There is no comprehensive bibliography: the longest listing of periodical and book materials&#151;Lewis Melville's in <span class="italic">Thackeray: a Biography</span>, volume 2 (1910)&#151;is augmented and corrected by E. Harden, <span class="italic">A checklist of contributions by William Makepeace Thackeray to newspapers, periodicals, books, and serial part issues, 1828&#150;1864</span> (1996), while the most detailed description of Thackeray's separately published books is Henry S. Van Duzer's <span class="italic">A Thackeray Library</span> (1919). Gordon Ray's four-volume collection of Thackeray's letters in the 1940s (<span class="italic">William Makepeace Thackeray: Letters and Private Papers</span>) and his two-volume biography in the mid-1950s (<span class="italic">The Uses of Adversity</span> and <span class="italic">The Age of Wisdom</span>) brought Thackeray a burst of attention and new appreciation. Ray's remains the standard biography, while his study of the living prototypes for Thackeray's fiction, <span class="italic">The Buried Life</span> (1952), adds significantly to knowledge of Thackeray's circle of acquaintance. The economics and logistics of Thackeray's professional affairs with publishers are detailed in Peter Shillingsburg's <span class="italic">Pegasus in Harness</span> (1992) and his methods of composition are described in Edgar Harden's <span class="italic">The Emergence of Thackeray's Serial Fiction</span> (1979) and his <span class="italic">Thackeray's English Humourists and Four Georges</span> (1985). The record of Thackeray's meticulous attention to detail is continued in <span class="italic">Annotations for selected works of William Makepeace Thackeray</span>, edited by Edgar Harden (1990); Harden's two-volume <span class="italic">Thackeray the Writer</span> (1998&#150;2000); and R. D. McMaster's <span class="italic">Thackeray's Cultural Frame of Reference</span> (1991). Evidence of Thackeray's interest in historical details about London in the second and third decades of the nineteenth century, the period of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, is traced by Joan Stevens in &#145;<i>Vanity Fair</i>&#146; and the London skyline (<span class="italic">Costerus</span>, new ser., 2, 1974, 13&#150;41). Stevens shows the historical and geographical accuracy of the novel, though it is notoriously and deliberately anachronistic in its description of dress. Thackeray's carelessness and capacity for error are recorded by John Sutherland in <span class="italic">Victorian Fiction: Writers, Publishers, Readers</span> (1995). Two supplementary volumes of letters were compiled by Harden (1994). <br>
<br>Thackeray's novels have been the subject of a number of film adaptations, beginning with <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> in 1911. A version of 1935 entitled <span class="italic">Becky Sharp</span> (or <span class="italic">Lady of Fortune</span> in the United States) starred Miriam Hopkins, Cedric Hardwicke, and Nigel Bruce. In 1975 Stanley Kubrick made a highly acclaimed motion picture of <span class="italic">Barry Lyndon</span>, employing cutting-edge cinematography but apparently completely missing the point that Thackeray intended readers to see through Barry's self-aggrandizement to the criminal heart. However beautiful and innovative as a film, Kubrick's Barry is rather romanticized, like the fictional criminals Thackeray was writing against. <br>
<br>By the end of the twentieth century Thackeray was overshadowed by much more successful resurgences of interest in Anthony Trollope, the Bront&euml;s, George Eliot, and even more so, Charles Dickens. In spite of Hollywood and BBC adaptations and new biographies&#151;<span class="italic">Thackeray</span> by D. J. Taylor (1999) and <span class="italic">William Makepeace Thackeray: a Literary Life</span> by P. Shillingsburg (2001)&#151;Thackeray's works do not now attract the public they deserve. Except for <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> they are not often taught in schools. Thackeray's realism, detached tolerance, and failure to assert expected Victorian moral imperatives may explain some of this neglect. The historical weight of his later novels may have alienated some modern readers, yet his skill in speech, his vivid characters, and his philosophical stance deserve more appreciation.<br>
