<span class="headword">Cuningham,  James MacNabb</span>  (1829&#150;1905), <span class="occ">military surgeon and medical administrator</span>, was born at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 June 1829, the son of Major William Cunningham of the 54th Bengal infantry. Cuningham, who altered the spelling of his surname, read medicine at Edinburgh University and graduated MD in 1851, receiving a commendation for his thesis on diseases of the aorta. Soon after joining the Bengal medical service in November 1851 he was appointed superintendent of Bareilly prison; later he occupied a similar position at Meerut. At the latter station he was also engaged in non-medical duties, as the superintendent of the government press for the North-Western Provinces. Cuningham was twice married: first, on 2 March 1854, to Mary, only daughter of James McRae, and second, after her death, to Georgina Euphemia, daughter of Robert Reid Macredie, on 11 April 1889.<br>
<br>Cuningham's aptitude for administrative work led to his appointment in 1866 as secretary to the new Indian sanitary commission. In the same year he was made professor of hygiene at the Calcutta Medical College, and in 1869 he was appointed to the new post of sanitary commissioner to the government of Bengal. He also became the first sanitary commissioner to the government of India, a post which he held from 1875 until his retirement in 1885. In addition to these considerable duties, Cuningham was made head of the Bengal medical department in 1880 and promoted to the rank of surgeon-general.<br>
<br>Cuningham made few original contributions to medical science and achieved renown chiefly on account of his administrative work. He eschewed laboratory work in favour of epidemiological investigation. As one obituarist put it, &#145;he was apt to throw cold water on strivings towards the truth by local enquiry and clinical and pathological investigation&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 164). He sought to exclude from official reports all theoretical speculations on the nature and spread of diseases such as cholera, especially those which seemed to imply the need for government intervention or the outlay of public money. The official view of cholera, which Cuningham defended with great vigour, was that it was not a contagious disease and that the quarantines imposed against vessels sailing from India were unnecessary. According to Cuningham cholera could be prevented only by general sanitation and education of the public in hygiene, a view which he expounded in his most important publication, <span class="italic">Cholera: what the State can do to Prevent it</span>, in 1884 (translated into German in 1895).<br>
<br>Cuningham maintained this position despite mounting criticism until he retired from the Indian Medical Service. In India he became embroiled in bitter conflicts with A. C. De Renzy and W. R. Cornish, the sanitary commissioners of the Punjab and Madras respectively, who held the fashionable view that cholera was a water-borne disease. De Renzy's persistent refusal to toe the official line eventually led to his dismissal and transfer to a remote station in Assam. But while Cuningham's insistence that cholera was not a contagious disease won him the admiration of Indian officials, it was eventually to cost him his scientific reputation. His position was attacked and even ridiculed in the British medical press, while the endeavours of his Indian opponents were held up as models of scientific enquiry. However, Cuningham was generally held in high esteem as an administrator and his pivotal role in building a sanitary infrastructure in British India was widely acknowledged.<br>
<br>Cuningham left India in April 1885 and in June the following year was made a companion in the Order of the Star of India. He was appointed honorary surgeon to Queen Victoria in 1888, and served on the army sanitary committee from 1891 to 1896. In 1892 he was made an honorary LLD of Edinburgh. He died at his home in Buckingham Palace Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, London, from a stroke, on 26 June 1905, survived by two sons and a daughter from his first marriage.<br>
