<span class="headword">Hughes,  Thomas  McKenny</span>  (1832&#150;1917), <span class="occ">geologist, speleologist, and archaeologist</span>, was born in December 1832, in Aberystwyth, one of the family of three sons and five daughters of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14083/', "Revd Joshua Hughes (1807&#150;1889)")</script>, afterwards bishop of St Asaph, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1899), widow of Captain Gun, and daughter of Sir Thomas McKenny, first baronet, lawyer, lord mayor of Dublin, and a notable fighter for Catholic emancipation. From Llandovery College (Carmarthenshire), Hughes won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA in 1857, and proceeded MA in 1867. He had a brief career as a diplomatist in Rome in 1860&#150;61, first as secretary to the consul, Charles Newton, and later as acting consul. Newton, who later became keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum, inspired in McKenny Hughes an interest in archaeology which lasted all his life. Together they carried out many archaeological expeditions in the area.<br>
<br>While at Cambridge, McKenny Hughes had attended the lectures of Professor Adam Sedgwick, and he continued his geological interests with fieldwork in Italy in 1860. In 1861 he accepted an invitation from Sir Roderick Murchison to join the geological survey. Between 1861 and 1865 he developed his interests in stratigraphy of the Chalk and in Pleistocene and recent deposits in the Medway valley, and in 1865&#150;6 he worked on drift gravels in the St Albans and Hertford areas. He was transferred to the Lake District in 1866, and worked in Westmorland, Cumberland, and the Yorkshire dales until 1873, living for much of the survey in Sedbergh. In this period, he began his work on Lower Palaeozoic stratigraphy, concentrating on the areas of Kirkby Lonsdale, Sedbergh, Dent, Shap, and Kendal, Bowness, and Tebay. During these years he was entertained by the Revd George Frederick Weston, canon of Carlisle, at Crosby Ravensworth&#151;he was later to marry Weston's daughter, Mary Caroline (1860&#150;1916).<br>
<br>McKenny Hughes began a regular correspondence with Sir Charles Lyell, who was then working on the revision of his <span class="italic">Elements of Geology</span> and on <span class="italic">The Student's Elements of Geology</span>. The debate, aroused by McKenny Hughes's fieldwork, which broke new ground in the understanding of the mountain limestone country, and in particular the connection between Upper and Lower Silurian, Coniston Flags, Upper Red Conglomerate, and Millstone Grit, was of considerable importance and caused Lyell to revise several sections. Lyell and McKenny Hughes went on many geological expeditions together, including, in 1872, an extended tour of various caves of archaeological interest in the Dordogne valley, and the famous cave at Aurignac described later by Edouard Lartet.<br>
<br>McKenny Hughes and Lyell became firm friends, and Lyell subsequently supported McKenny Hughes as a candidate for the Woodwardian chair in geology at Cambridge, to which he was appointed in 1873 (succeeding Adam Sedgwick). Between them they held the chair in geology for ninety-nine years, until Hughes's death in 1917. The growth in the teaching of natural science, caused by the introduction of the Cambridge natural science tripos in 1851, had led to extensive redevelopments by the university on both the north and the south sides of Downing Street. McKenny Hughes planned a new geological museum on the south side to provide more space for the geological collections and better classrooms, and as a memorial to his predecessor. He contrived, by patience and persuasion, to plan and complete the new museum. Despite pressure from the department of zoology to merge and rearrange the exhibits McKenny Hughes succeeded in retaining the geological exhibits, with the stratigraphical arrangement which he regarded as vital to their true understanding. Over one hundred years later they remain much as he planned them. The museum was designed between 1904 and 1911 by the famous architect T. G. Jackson (1835&#150;1924). It was opened by Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.<br>
<br>During his years at Cambridge, McKenny Hughes gathered about him a staff of distinction, which included Edward Tawney, Alfred Harker, J. E. Marr, Henry Woods, F. R. C. Reed, and Gertrude L. Elles. Under his leadership the school of geology spawned a long list of well-known geologists who served in universities, geological surveys, and museums in Britain, India, South Africa, and other countries. McKenny Hughes continued his own fieldwork on Lower Palaeozoic rocks, caves, and drift deposits in Wales, and in north Yorkshire (where he took his students every year), and made many contributions to archaeology in the Cambridge area. He was elected as fellow of the Geological Society in 1862, and fellow of the Royal Society in 1889, and was made a chevalier of the Italian order of SS Maurizio e Lazzaro. In 1891 he was awarded the Lyell medal of the Geological Society.<br>
<br>McKenny Hughes was a popular and gregarious man. In 1882, when university professors were permitted to marry, he returned, at the age of fifty, to Crosby Ravensworth to seek the hand of Mary Caroline Weston. She was a keen amateur archaeologist, a botanist, and a distinguished artist, and under his tuition she became a valuable geologist. Following their marriage, the couple travelled together on field excursions, and worked on the Pleistocene deposits, and on excavations in the Cambridge area. They both attended the International Geological Congress of 1891 in the USA, where they were part of a small group which visited the national parks of North America, including the Grand Canyon, into which descent was made from the north rim. Much of the journey was made on horseback, through territory still under Native American occupation. They subsequently attended the International Geological Congress in Russia in 1897, visiting sites in the Caucasus and Georgia, returning via Sevastopol, Odessa, Constantinople, Athens, Pompeii, and Rome. In the more remote areas they were accompanied by an armed guard. They had three sons: Tom, an architect (the eldest, killed in 1918 while carrying out aerial reconnaissance behind enemy lines in France), George, clerk to the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, and Alfred, an entomologist. McKenny Hughes died at his home, Ravensworth, Brooklands Avenue, Cambridge, on 9 June 1917, and was buried in Cambridge three days later. His published works and articles included, with J. W. Clarke, <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Adam Sedgwick</span> (1890) and, with Mary Caroline Hughes, <span class="italic">Cambridgeshire</span> (1909).<br>
