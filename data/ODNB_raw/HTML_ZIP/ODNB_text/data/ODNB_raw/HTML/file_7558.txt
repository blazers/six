<span class="headword">Dethick, Sir  William</span>  (1543&#150;1612), <span class="occ">herald and antiquary</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7557/', "Sir Gilbert Dethick (1499/1500&#150;1584)")</script> and Alice Peterson (<i>d</i>. 1572). The Latin poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71043/', "Henry Dethick")</script> was a younger brother. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, and was later a member of Gray's Inn, but his principal education came from his father, who obtained for him the post of Rouge Croix pursuivant on 9 February 1567, and whom he accompanied to the Garter investitures of Charles IX (1564) and Emperor Maximilian (1568). He left the latter expedition to travel independently in Italy in order to increase his considerable knowledge of Roman antiquities.<br>
<br>William Dethick became York herald by patent dated 24 March 1570. Displaying early signs of arrogance, probably fostered by his father's position, he made three grants of arms under his own seal. Eighteen months after his father died he succeeded him as Garter king of arms. He bribed the signet clerk to add a clause to his patent, dated 21 April 1586, allowing him to make visitations and grant arms, thus breaching the rights of Norroy, Ulster, and Clarenceux kings of arms. He then proceeded to abort Clarenceux's visitation of Lincolnshire, consequently earning a severe reprimand from Lord Burghley. He surrendered the patent, which was regranted without the new rights, but following Burghley's death in 1598 he produced a copy of the original one. He never interfered with visitations again, but continued to make grants himself, including one to William Shakespeare's father, which was criticized by his fellow herald Ralph Brooke for being too similar to Lord Mauley's. In 1595 Dethick was cited in Star Chamber for having granted George Rotheram the arms of Lord Grey of Ruthin on the basis of a false pedigree. He blamed this on Rotheram, but there were other charges of pedigree forgery too.<br>
<br>Dethick's integrity as a genealogist was no worse than that of his contemporaries, at a time when the discipline of using original records to prove pedigrees was still in its infancy. John Anstis, in his account of the Order of the Garter, published in 1724, praised Dethick for his diligence. The old Society of Antiquaries, of which he was an active member, used to meet in his rooms; he himself contributed papers (printed by Hearne in 1771) on such subjects as mottes, epitaphs, and the antiquity of Christianity in England. None of his other writings, which survive in collections in the British Library, the College of Arms, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, have been printed. They include some fine heraldic manuscripts, notably &#145;A booke of the armes of the noblemen in Henry the Fifts tyme&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 1864), and works on such subjects as Germany and its principal families, and the Swiss grisons.<br>
<br>More serious than bad pedigree work was Dethick's apparent support of the prospective marriage of the duke of Norfolk and Mary, queen of Scots, in 1571, demonstrated by his marshalling their arms together on a manuscript pedigree and in some stained glass. For this treasonous act he was suspended from office, but Queen Elizabeth forgave him, and in due course he oversaw Mary's funeral at Peterborough in 1587. In 1596 he accompanied the earl of Shrewsbury for the presentation of the Garter to Henri IV of France, who gave him 500 crowns. His account of his mission survives in BL, Add. MS 6298, fol. 280. In 1601, when the earl of Essex rebelled in London, Dethick accompanied Thomas Cecil, Lord Burghley, into the city to proclaim the earl a traitor and to persuade him to desist. Essex later claimed &#145;I saw no herald but that branded fellow, whom I took not for an herald&#146;. To this, the answer was that &#145;an herald, though a wicked man, is nevertheless an herald&#146;  (Noble, 199&#150;200).<br>
<br>James I knighted Dethick on 13 May 1603. His popularity with the king was matched by his unpopularity with his fellow heralds, who presented many charges of his atrocious behaviour. In 1573 he attacked the Chester herald's wife, pushing her head into the fireplace with his boot, and pouring hot ashes, alcohol, and the contents of her chamber pot over her head, and was only prevented from killing her by his cousin Richard Dethick of Polstead, Suffolk. According to Brooke, he punched his own father (who cursed him for it), wounded his brother with a dagger at Windsor Castle, and beat and slandered many of his fellow heralds, writing, for example, of &#145;Clarentius the drunkard, Mr Wade the vainglorious, Chester the tavern haunter&#146; and &#145;Richmond herald that should have been executed at Berwick&#146;  (Wagner, 201). He interrupted the funeral of Sir Henry Sidney at Penshurst by hitting the minister, and that of the countess of Sussex in Westminster Abbey by striking two people with his dagger, for which he was indicted at Newgate, though he escaped being charged because he knew the recorder and because one of the victims did not attend to present evidence.<br>
<br>Responding to an allegation that Dethick had disparaged the Stuarts' right to the crown, James I gave William Segar, Somerset herald, a signet bill to be Garter. Remembering Dethick's good offices to his mother, Mary, queen of Scots, however, James I sent Dethick, still with his title of Garter, in August 1603 to place a pall of state on her tomb, and the next month he was sent, again as Garter, to invest the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg, for which he was rewarded richly. Dethick's enemies persisted, alleging irregularities in the investiture, and James I capitulated, allowing a warrant for Dethick's dismissal to pass the great seal on 1 January 1604. Dethick refused to yield, wearing his tabard defiantly at court that Christmas, but the marshal's court on 26 January 1605 confirmed the dismissal. He still refused to abandon his office, and sought redress from parliament and the court of common pleas, but finally the king persuaded him to give up his office in return for an annuity increased from &pound;40 to &pound;200 and exemption from all taxes. Once this was granted, he finally surrendered his office to Segar in December 1606. Even then his bad behaviour continued, and he was fined and sentenced to imprisonment by a church court for calling a clergyman &#145;a bald, rascally priest&#146; and striking him  (Noble, 201).<br>
<br>Dethick wrote his will on 21 April 1612, and it was proved on 26 October that year. He was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. He had married Thomasine (whose burial took place on 18 July 1633 at Stepney), only daughter of Robert Young, citizen and fishmonger of London. They had three sons: George of Gray's Inn, to whom he left his house in Poplar; Gilbert, who became registrar of the court of chivalry (<i>d</i>. 1639), and whose daughter Ann married John Watson, Bluemantle; and Henry (<i>d</i>. 1639), to whom he left his papers, and who was the father of Henry Dethick, Richmond herald, and of Elizabeth, wife of Everard Exton, Rouge Dragon.<br>
