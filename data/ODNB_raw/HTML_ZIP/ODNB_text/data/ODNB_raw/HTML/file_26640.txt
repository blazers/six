<span class="headword">Strange, Sir  Thomas Andrew Lumisden</span>  (1756&#150;1841), <span class="occ">judge in India and writer</span>, was born on 30 November 1756 at Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London, the fourth of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26638/', "Sir Robert Strange (1725&#150;1792)")</script>, engraver, of Kirkwall in the Orkneys, and Isabella (1721/2&#150;1808), daughter of William Lumisden, of Cushnie, Aberdeenshire. His mother's family were staunch Jacobites: his maternal uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17173/', "Andrew Lumisden")</script> was private secretary to Charles Edward Stuart in Rome. After developing a friendship with Lumisden while they were both in Rome, Strange's father enrolled in the Jacobite life guards during the rising of 1745. Andrew Strange's colonial career depended heavily on his family's Scottish connections.<br>
<br>Strange was admitted to Westminster School on 3 March 1769, and was awarded a king's scholarship in the following year. He was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 1 June 1774, graduating BA (1778) and MA (1782). Strange entered Lincoln's Inn in 1776, where he came under the patronage of the lord chief justice Lord Mansfield, a friend of his mother's. He was called to the bar in November 1787, and was appointed chief justice of Halifax, Nova Scotia, two years later, a position he obtained through Mansfield. He remained there for seven years, during which time he gained a reputation for conciliation in the debate between Nova Scotia's house of assembly and the council. Gradually Strange became weary of the conduct of Governor John Wentworth, and he left for England in July 1796.<br>
<br>In this year Strange's elder brother James sought leave of absence for the young judge, intending that Strange should enter parliament. But on his return he preferred to continue his imperial legal career. He was offered the position of recorder and president of the mayor's court in Madras by Sir Lawrence Dundas. While at Ramsgate in the summer of 1797, Andrew Lumisden introduced Strange to Jane Cecilia Anstruther (<i>d</i>. 1799), whose brother was a barrister in Madras. Jane and Thomas were married on 1 September 1797. Immediately before leaving, on 14 March 1798, Strange was knighted.<br>
<br>Under the charter enacted in Madras on 26 December 1800, the Madras mayor's court was re-created as the supreme court of Madras, with a chief justice and two puisne judges. Strange was immediately appointed chief justice of the court, a position he occupied until 1816. While in Madras Strange pursued an interest in the antiquities and architecture of ancient India, collecting drawings of south Indian temples. In 1801, at the height of British fear that the French would invade India via Egypt, two volunteer militias were organized in Madras. One was headed by the governor, Lord Clive; the other was commanded by Strange.<br>
<br>In 1799 Strange's wife, Jane, died in childbirth. Four years later he took leave to return to England. While in Nova Scotia he had intended to make a tour of the United States of America, but had been prevented from doing so by the war with France. In 1803 he revived his interest in travel to the United States, and departed Madras on an American ship bound for New York via St Helena. His aims were once again frustrated by war. News of the renewal of hostilities between France and Britain reached St Helena soon after Strange's arrival there in June 1803. Believing the passage to America too dangerous, and after waiting four months on the island for a convoy large enough to return to Britain, Strange sailed on a vessel bound for London. Soon after his return to Madras on 27 August 1806 Strange met his second wife, Louisa Burroughs (1788&#150;1862), daughter of the Calcutta judge Sir William Burroughs. Within days they were engaged, and married at the chapel of Fort St George on 11 October 1806.<br>
<br>In his professional life Strange was concerned with what he believed was the &#145;uncertainty&#146; of Indian law. Having jurisdiction only within the city of Madras's boundaries, both the mayor's court and its successor, the supreme court, applied English law to most civil and criminal causes. However, for disputes between Indian litigants that concerned inheritance, succession, and contract the judges based their decrees on the verdict of Indian legal officials employed to produce opinions according to Hindu and Muslim law. Strange's concern was that the opinions of the court's Hindu pandits in particular were vague and contradictory. Pre-colonial property disputes had been arbitrated by various authorities, who usually attempted to find an accommodation between the parties. Hindu or Muslim law texts offered moral and political guidance to the ruler; they did not lay down definite rules or procedures with which to try disputes. However, like most of his contemporaries, Strange believed that a common Hindu law had existed in pre-colonial India. Accordingly, he believed that the contradictory, inconsistent character of the legal opinions which his Indian officers gave him were a sign of the degenerate state of Hindu law. Such uncertainty, he argued, militated against the security of property in the province.<br>
<br>On retiring from the bench in 1816, Strange published a selection of translated Hindu legal opinions which he had compiled while a judge. The three-volume <span class="italic">Notes of Cases, in the Court of the Recorder and Supreme Court of Judiciary at Madras</span> was intended as a manual for those adjudicating causes which did not turn on &#145;local circumstances&#146; or English law. The text was intended to meet the perceived problem of south Indian legal uncertainty. However, in his second publication&#151;<span class="italic">Elements of Hindu Law</span>, published from London in 1826&#151;Strange went further in attempting to reconstruct the supposed &#145;principles&#146; of Hindu law from the opinions of pandits and the translations of ancient Sanskrit texts available at the time. In doing so, he was one of the first British officials to offer a coherent and systematic account of supposedly &#145;ancient&#146; Hindu jurisprudence. Until the 1860s <span class="italic">Elements of Hindu Law</span> was regarded by most judicial officials as the only authoritative account of Hindu jurisprudence. The editor of the third edition of the text suggested that &#145;The Indian Courts are still governed as authoritatively by Sir Thomas Strange, as the old Philosophers were by Plato and Aristotle&#146;  (J. D. Mayne, introduction, T. Strange, <span class="italic">Hindu Law</span>, 3rd edn, 1864, xxv). Strange's work played an important part in the colonial transformation of Indian jurisprudence. His <span class="italic">Elements of Hindu Law</span> played a key role in the process in which the flexible idioms of pre-colonial judicial practice were replaced by textualized, prescriptive sanctions that had the same status as the enactments of a legislature.<br>
<br>On his return from Madras, Strange travelled widely around Britain and on the continent. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26641/', "(Thomas) Lumisden Strange")</script> described him as &#145;grave and studious&#146;  (Strange, 41) in contrast to his more vivacious brother James. Strange and his second wife, Louisa, had twelve children, three of whom (Thomas Lumisden, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26634/', "Alexander Strange")</script>, and William Robert Strange) also had careers in the East India Company's service. Strange spent the last years of his life living in Harley Street, London, but died after a protracted illness at St Leonards in Sussex on 16 July 1841. He was survived by his wife, who died on 2 January 1862.<br>
