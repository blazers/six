<span class="headword">D'Este, Sir  Augustus Frederick</span>  (1794&#150;1848), <span class="occ">peerage claimant</span>, was born on 13 January 1794, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/900/', "Augustus Frederick, duke of Sussex (1773&#150;1843)")</script>, and Lady Augusta Murray (<i>bap</i>. 1761, <i>d</i>. 1830), second daughter of the fourth earl of Dunmore. Their marriage, which took place in Rome and was repeated in London in 1793, was declared invalid under the terms of the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Act</span>, and the relationship ended late in 1801. Lady Augusta (who was deeply chagrined at her treatment by the royal family) brought up her son to think of himself as a prince and as a possible suitor for his cousin Princess Charlotte of Wales. Sussex brought actions against her to prevent her calling herself duchess of Sussex, and accepted the illegitimacy of Augustus and his sister Augusta Emma (later Lady Truro) with apparent equanimity. Augustus was sent to Harrow School in 1807, under the surname Douglas, but in 1809 Sussex claimed custody of his children, gave them the surname D'Este (a family name of the house of Brunswick), and placed his son at Winchester College. In practice the D'Este children appear to have continued living with their mother, who was given the title Lady D'Ameland.<br>
<br>Like other royal bastards D'Este suffered from the uncertainty of his status: his mother had heightened his pretensions but could not make the world accept him. In 1812 he joined the 7th Royal Fusiliers as a lieutenant, and served with them in Jersey (where he annoyed his superiors); in 1814 he went with them to America, where as aide-de-camp to Sir John Lambert he participated in the ill-fated attack on New Orleans in January 1815. In 1817 he received the command of a troop in the 9th lancers, and in 1822 he was appointed major in the 4th Royal Irish Dragoons. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1824 and colonel in 1838, but his active career in the army had long since ended.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1825 D'Este fell in love with the half-sister of Princess Victoria of Kent, Princess Feodora of Leiningen. Their romance had the assistance of a lady-in-waiting, but when it was discovered by the duchess of Kent, Sussex wrote &#145;purposely to insult, to torture and to outrage every sentiment of Honor, of moral principle and of integrity of his son&#146;  (Firth, 22), insisting that the inappropriate relationship end at once. Shortly afterwards D'Este suffered the first serious attack of a disease that dominated the rest of his life&#151;disseminated, or multiple, sclerosis. He kept a detailed account of his symptoms, which included numbness in his legs, unsteadiness in walking, problems with his eyes, general debility and weakness, twitching in his limbs, and, as the years passed, bouts of giddiness and increasing pain. He also recorded in detail the various cures and remedies that he sought at spas and seaside resorts throughout England and Europe; he tried baths, douching, massages, changes of air, electrical therapy, and constantly evolving prescriptions of drugs and exercise regimens. In March 1843, for example, &#145;I went to Brighton, where I took some Vapor-baths and was shampoo'd at Mahomets&#146;  (ibid., 35). The various cures had no effect on the progression of the disease, and he was increasingly confined to a wheelchair.<br>
<br>D'Este's great preoccupation was with his status. From William IV (already hard pressed by his own extensive illegitimate family) he received in 1830 a knight commandership of the Royal Guelphic order, a civil-list pension, and the appointment of deputy ranger of St James's Park and Hyde Park. This was not enough to dissuade D'Este from pursuing his claim to a peerage, and in 1831, according to Greville, he &#145;filed a bill in chancery, into which he had put all his father's love letters, written thirty years ago, to perpetuate evidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), having received a legal opinion that the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Act</span> did not apply abroad, and that in consequence his birth was legitimate. In 1834 he petitioned the duke of Cambridge to intercede with the king for recognition of his legitimacy, and on the duke of Sussex's death, in 1843, he made a claim to succeed to his father's honours. In neither attempt was he successful.<br>
<br>D'Este was an active member of the Aborigines Protection Society, particularly interested in native Americans. In 1833 he gave material assistance to Maconse, an Ojibwa, stranded in Britain. When Peter Jones, the Mississauga missionary and leader, visited Britain in 1838 to argue for the title of his people to their lands in Upper Canada, D'Este was one of his patrons; it was possibly through his good offices (and those of his cousin Sir Charles Murray, the master of the queen's household) that Jones was granted an audience with Queen Victoria in September 1838. Jones visited D'Este again in 1845, finding him &#145;as kind and as much interested for the welfare of the Aborigines of our country as ever&#146; but &#145;quite an invalid&#146; and &#145;not able to walk without assistance&#146;  (Smith, 200). It was perhaps Jones who sent D'Este a &#145;Present of Indian Moccassins&#146; in December 1846, which enabled him to walk without a steel bar to support his ankle  (Firth, 54). D'Este offered thanks for this &#145;decided Improvement&#146; in the last entry in the casebook of his condition. He lived for another two years, and died, unmarried, in London on 28 December 1848. He was buried next to his mother at St Laurence, on the Isle of Thanet. D'Este's record of his illness, written with some detachment and great powers of self-observation, is probably the &#145;earliest clinical account of disseminated sclerosis&#146;, albeit written by a layman  (Firth, preface); the first pathological description dates from 1836.<br>
