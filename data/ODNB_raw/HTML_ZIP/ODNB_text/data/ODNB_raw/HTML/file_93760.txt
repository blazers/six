<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Norton,  Peter John  Hill-</span>, Baron Hill-Norton  (1915&#150;2004), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born Peter John Norton on 8 February 1915 in Germiston, South Africa, the only son of Martin John (Jack) Norton (<i>d</i>. 1928), mining engineer and farmer, and his wife, Margery Birnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (<i>d</i>. 1940). In 1917 the family moved to England so that Martin Norton, a South African citizen, could join the Royal Flying Corps and fight for Britain in the First World War. After the war he tried farming in Wales without success, and in 1924 returned alone to South Africa, dying of dengue fever four years later without seeing his wife and son again. Widow and son had some very difficult years financially, but were enabled by the generosity of a great-aunt to fund the boy's entry in 1928 into the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, thus fulfilling an ambition of several years' standing and a family tradition of service to the crown. His career in the following years followed the pattern established for officers of high potential who excelled, as he did, in both academic work and sporting activities: midshipman in a cruiser and battleships with some &#145;destroyer time&#146;, sub-lieutenant's professional courses, charge of a battleship gunroom and the ship's youngest officers, divisional and sports officer in a cruiser, and specialization in gunnery at the start of the Second World War. Two matters of domestic note occurred: about 1931 he added Hill to his surname because an officer senior to him was not only named Norton but had the same initials and &#145;a rather racier lifestyle&#146; with some misplaced bills in consequence  (private information); and in 1936 he married Margaret Eileen Linstow (<i>b</i>. 1916), the daughter of Carl Adolph Linstow, from a distinguished Danish family. They had first met six years before on a beach in Belgium. Marriage for a naval officer at the early age of twenty-one was frowned on at that time, but theirs was a true and lifelong match; they complemented each other admirably. They had two children, Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 1939) and Carla Ann (<i>b</i>. 1943).<br>
<br>During the Second World War, after some time on the instructional staff at the gunnery school, Hill-Norton was appointed to the anti-aircraft cruiser <i>Cairo</i>. He did not think much of this ship or her capabilities, but she provided him with a seminal experience. During an early bombing raid on Plymouth, where the ship was lying secured to a buoy, Hill-Norton was blown off the forecastle by a near miss and found himself, after a brief airborne trajectory, swimming for his life still with a steel helmet on. An appointment followed to the cruiser <i>Cumberland</i>, which took part (as had the <i>Cairo</i>) in the arduous and dangerous convoys to north Russia. In 1943 he joined the gunnery division at the Admiralty, where his technical abilities were quickly recognized. Then came an important gunnery charge appointment, to HMS <i>Howe</i>, one of the latest battleships and a component of the British Pacific Fleet, which took part in all the later campaigns of the Second World War against Japan.<br>
<br>Peace brought a suitably relaxed job, in the cruiser <i>Nigeria</i>, the flagship of the south Atlantic station. Here Hill-Norton performed both service and social duties with distinction, and it was no surprise when he was selected for early promotion to commander at the end of 1947. In this rank he returned to the Admiralty with the naval ordnance division. At that time relations between Britain and the United States in the field of technological development were strained because of the lack of trust resulting from espionage within the scientific establishments. Hill-Norton restored much of the relationship in his field of gun and missile technology by personal effort and conduct, and was able to redirect British development on lines closer to those of the USA. His next appointment could scarcely have been more challenging. He was executive officer of the new aircraft carrier <i>Eagle</i>, the largest, most complex, and most heavily manned ship in the Royal Navy to that date. He took up this appointment in 1951 and went into it with his by now well-known energy and attention to detail; it was said that he &#145;knew every rivet&#146; and certainly every compartment in the ship. His interest in and knowledge of her company were equally comprehensive. Promoted captain at the end of this exacting but successful commission at the end of 1952, he later confessed to having been in need of some rest and relaxation. His next two years provided at least some of this in his posting as naval attach&eacute; at Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Asunci&oacute;n.<br>
<br>Hill-Norton had unusually reached nearly the middle of the captains' list without exercising sea command, the high point of many officers' careers and certainly an essential element in progress towards flag rank. In 1956 he was appointed to command HMS <i>Decoy</i>, a destroyer of the Daring class. These were complex, heavily armed ships that would surely have been classed as light cruisers a generation earlier. In the <i>Decoy</i> Hill-Norton was soon put to the operational test, for in mid-1956 the Suez crisis erupted, and the subsequent operation Musketeer fully involved his ship. She responded to every call made upon her, firing, it was said, almost her full outfit of ammunition in support of the troops ashore. A further Whitehall appointment followed in the defence research policy staff: gruelling and detailed work that was scarcely the best preparation for the greatest ship-command challenge possible. This was the aircraft carrier <i>Ark Royal</i>, the only sister ship of the <i>Eagle</i>, which Hill-Norton commanded from 1959 to 1961. He probably enjoyed this job more than any other in his career. Its complexity, variety, and constant activity all appealed to him; he described it as &#145;very like war without the bullets&#146;  (Hill-Norton and Tyrie, tape 19). He made the ship, when at sea, a 24-hour-a-day undertaking; he was a pioneer of night flying operations when many experienced naval aviators looked askance at them. He recognized, however, that even his powers of endurance could not cope with endless charge on the bridge, and was consistent in turning over to the executive officer the duty of command during the afternoon, whether flying was taking place or not.<br>
<br>Promoted rear-admiral in January 1962, Hill-Norton proceeded to another Admiralty appointment, this time as assistant chief of naval staff. In this post he consolidated his reputation as a blunt, straight-talking, and hard-hitting practitioner of Whitehall business. He was appointed CB in 1964. There followed an important operational command as flag officer second-in-command of the Far East Fleet from 1964 to 1966. He was the senior embarked officer of a powerful body of warships, naval aircraft, and Royal Marines during the most intensive part of the confrontation with Indonesia that attended the formation and ensured the survival of the independent states of Malaysia and Singapore, arguably the most successful (and largely unsung) achievement of British arms in the second half of the twentieth century. There followed several Whitehall appointments whose rapid succession was caused, in part, by unexpected changes in the senior officers' hierarchy through illness or resignation. The first, as deputy chief of defence staff (personnel and logistics), was probably relinquished without too much regret, but a subsequent short tour as second sea lord and chief of naval personnel gave little time for any projected reform. However, Hill-Norton, knighted KCB in 1967, moved on in that year to a task even more suited to his talents, that of vice chief of naval staff. In this hugely influential post at the hub of all naval business his impact was immense. His always abrupt, decisive, and sometimes abrasive style was well suited to the time, when the Royal Navy was recovering from the blow of the cancellation of a new generation of aircraft carriers and the planned constriction of its operations largely into the sea area of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He complemented in turn two first sea lords of quite different character, Sir Varyl Begg and Sir Michael Le Fanu, and was critically instrumental in the evolution of the future navy and its concept of operations.<br>
<br>In 1969 Hill-Norton became commander-in-chief of British forces (of all three services) in the Far East, the last officer to hold such a post. Though the confrontation with Indonesia was now over and Malaysia and Singapore's future better assured, there was much consolidation to be done in the field of security. Hill-Norton was instrumental in setting up the five power defence agreement that survived to the end of the century and beyond. A less congenial task was supervising the rundown of British forces in the area, numbering 80,000, but this was achieved with few problems thanks to careful planning and implementation.<br>
<br>Hill-Norton's return to the United Kingdom in 1970 (when he was promoted GCB) was initially in the post of first sea lord and chief of naval staff, a position long predicted for him. He had, he subsequently said, set himself three major objectives (the maximum he believed to be realistically possible in a normal tour of duty). In the event he managed only two. The first was the abolition of the traditional rum ration. Along with most senior officers, and the more far-sighted senior ratings, he had long recognized that the daily issue to each sailor of an eighth of a pint of strong spirits seriously detracted from the efficiency of a highly technical fighting service, and his determination&#151;with the help of an unexpected piece of Treasury generosity that established the charitable Sailors' Fund in compensation&#151;saw the change through with very little fuss. The second was a so-called concordat between Hill-Norton and Sir John Grandy, chief of air staff, to minimize conflict between the naval and air staffs, endemic for several years previously; condign sanctions were threatened against transgressors.<br>
<br>Hill-Norton's time as first sea lord was cut short through the untimely illness of his predecessor, Sir Michael Le Fanu, who was due for appointment as chief of defence staff but had contracted leukaemia, from which he subsequently died. This created a dilemma for the secretary of state for defence, Lord Carrington, who wished Hill-Norton to move straight into the post; the latter demurred, asking for time to prepare his own succession. In consequence the sitting chief of defence staff, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Elworthy, agreed to an extension and Hill-Norton succeeded to the post in March 1971, the appointment being marked by his promotion to admiral of the fleet. His time as chief of defence staff was partly the consolidation of previous policy and partly planning for the future. He had not expected the position and, by his own admission, had much to learn about the other two services; he had not attended a tri-service college (a deficiency he tended to regard as an advantage), and had only limited operational experience with them. But he learned with care and, as is apparent from the numerous lectures and speeches he gave, fairness and thorough appreciation of the problems; although he always gave good measure to the threat from the Soviet navy, which did not, as he often said, recognize NATO boundaries. One of his preoccupations at this time was the British nuclear deterrent and in particular the attitude to it of his likely successor as chief of defence staff, General Sir Michael Carver. Carver, then chief of the general staff, was known to be sceptical of its utility, and Hill-Norton pressed him <i>&agrave; deux</i> to make his views and intentions clear, but was unable to get an answer. In the event Carver, as chief of defence staff, loyally followed government policy, only opposing it openly after he had retired, when debates in the House of Lords between Hill-Norton and Lord Lewin on the one hand, and Carver on the other, caused much entertainment to civilian members.<br>
<br>On his supersession as chief of defence staff Hill-Norton did not expect further employment in a service capacity, but he was offered the post of chairman of the military committee of NATO and took office in April 1974. It was a difficult time for the alliance. Member governments were either set in their ways or moving in a more passive direction, and were generally niggardly in their provision. The doctrine of flexible response, established in the late 1960s, was sound enough but its implementation was often short on substance. Hill-Norton brought to the task of stiffening NATO resolve and action his well-known qualities of bluntness and determination, but also an unexpected degree of diplomatic skill. In this he fully complemented the outstanding secretary-general, Josef Luns; the admiration of the two men was mutual. An early challenge, the aftermath of the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in the summer of 1974, when Greece and Turkey&#151;both members of NATO&#151;might easily have gone to war, was met by Hill-Norton's shuttle visits to the chiefs of defence of both countries. He modestly said years later that he was &#145;rather proud&#146; of the peaceful result  (private information). His expositions of NATO policy in the public arena were widespread and frequent. His private transactions in the headquarters showed a mixture of subtlety and forthrightness: examples included briefings, declaring the utmost personal confidentiality, to a German colleague in the knowledge that the details would get to Bonn within the hour, and a head-to-head with the newly arrived supreme allied commander, Europe, General Alexander Haig, that left the latter in no doubt about how NATO operated and who was in charge of its military establishment. Hill-Norton left NATO in 1977 in a considerably stronger state than it had been three years earlier. His achievement, which may well have been the most significant of his career, was recognized by his being created a life peer as Baron Hill-Norton in the new year's honours list of 1979.<br>
<br>Hill-Norton remained active for the rest of his life in a variety of fields. His two books, <span class="italic">No Soft Options</span> (1978) and <span class="italic">Sea Power</span> (1982), dealt respectively with the future of NATO and the material elements of navies. He was the first president of the British Maritime League (1982&#150;5), an organization that only partially succeeded in its purpose of promoting Britain's maritime interests. He also interested himself in the project for a radically new design of medium-sized warship (&#145;the short fat ship&#146;), and in the possibility of unidentified flying objects; in both he called for deeper investigation and examination of all available evidence, rather than out-and-out advocacy, though his position was often misunderstood. He was president of the Sea Cadets' Association (1977&#150;84) and the Defence Manufacturers' Association (1980&#150;84), a liveryman of the Shipwrights' Company, a freeman of the City of London, a governor of Reigate grammar school, and a director of several companies.<br>
<br>Hill-Norton was throughout his life a man of uncompromising honesty and determination. This led him to outstanding achievements in the defence field, but also to a bluntness of manner and often arbitrary way of command that gained him a fearsome reputation in the navy and, sometimes, outside it. It was said that of his generation he was the rudest man in the service. Yet there were also many testimonials to his fairness, frequent acts of kindness, and sense of humour. In the last years of his life he cared unstintingly for his frail wife, a measure of an underlying humanity recognized by many. He died on 16 May 2004 at Knoll House Hotel, Studland Bay, Dorset, of heart failure. His ashes were scattered at sea off Plymouth, where he had narrowly escaped death more than sixty years earlier. He was survived by his wife and their two children. His son, Nicholas, was also a naval officer, reaching the rank of vice-admiral and being knighted KCB in 1991.<br>
