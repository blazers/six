<span class="headword">Bowler,  William</span>  (1808&#150;1878), <span class="occ">hatter and feltmaker</span>, was born on 25 January 1808 in Denton, Lancashire, and baptized there on 20 March, one of nine children of William Bowler, hatter, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Catlow, who had married in Manchester Cathedral in 1798. The family descended from a long line of hatters in the Manchester area, dating back to 1331, when land was registered in the name of a Thomas Bowler. William Bowler's unmarried sister Nancy Bowler (1804/5&#150;1884) had a son <a name="cosubject_63531"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Bowler</span>  (1826&#150;1893)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized on 10 December 1826 at Denton.<br>
<br>Having left strike-troubled Stockport, where the hat industry was in serious crisis, William, who had married Nancy Cook (<i>d</i>. 1850) on 23 December 1832, and his nephew Thomas made their way south to seek work at one of the hatting factories in Southwark, London. William joined John Bowler &amp; Son, and probably took over his cousin's premises at 1 Crescent, Southwark Bridge Road in 1853, trading under the name of William Bowler.<br>
<br>Thomas Bowler, having been released from his seven-year indenture with his widowed aunt Dinah Bowler of Denton, joined the business of a French hatter established in London. He became foreman and later took over the company, which prospered under its original name, Victor Jay, and later Jay Hats, managed by consecutive generations of Bowlers. On 3 September 1848 he married Elizabeth Park, daughter of a hatter, at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, London. They had at least five daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>The hat which subsequently became known as a bowler was conceived north of the Thames at 6 St James Street, the premises of James Lock &amp; Co., distinguished hatters to royalty and gentry since 1667, and still trading at the same address in the twenty-first century. According to meticulously kept handwritten ledgers, &#145;stiff round crowned hats&#146; were very much in demand during the late 1840s. A new, more practical hat for young and active gentlemen was required during this period, which prompted the evolution of a round hard hat, which looked smart, was protective on the hunting field, and able to stand up to the smoke and soot of nineteenth-century railway journeys.<br>
<br>James Lock &amp; Co. ledgers record an order placed by the Hon. Edward Coke, son of the first earl of Leicester, dated 25 August 1849, for a shooting hat, giving specific measurements of the brim. Consequent entries of orders by young gentlemen and friends of Edward Coke suggest that he might have started a new trend. The ledger refers to each order as &#145;a brown Coke hat&#146;, leading to the assumption that the first bowler was not black, but made of highly stiffened brown fur felt. To this day, Lock &amp; Co. refer to the hat as a &#145;Coke hat&#146;, named after the first customer who ordered it.<br>
<br>According to the industrial legend recorded by Frank Whitbourn in his history of James Lock &amp; Co., published in 1971, William Bowler was summoned from south London, given Edward Coke's requirements for a new hat, and set about work in his factory at Southwark. After the prototype was delivered to Locks, Edward Coke jumped on it, testing its hardness and durability, and, pleased with the result, ordered the new style of hat for the gamekeepers on his estate. Locks' supplier's book reveals, however, that the Bowler factories never supplied Lock &amp; Co. with felt hats. The established manufacturer was J. Ellwood &amp; Sons of Blackfriars Road, which happened to be very close to the Bowlers in Southwark. The link between the supplier, the manufacturer, and the Bowlers, whose name became synonymous with this style of hat, may lie in the secret recipe for the stiffening of the raw material, the felt hoods, from which the hats were made.<br>
<br>The stiffening of the bowler hat, which is essential to its shape and silhouette, is the result of an arduous manual procedure. Shellac, a dark, treacle-like substance extracted from the secretion of an insect parasite living on trees in south-east Asia, is chipped, heated, and diluted in methylated spirit. The felt hoods are manually rolled in the mixture, with the spirit evaporating, leaving the shellac in the matted felt fibres. The recipe for felt stiffening, which Thomas Bowler used at his factory, is alleged to have come from a village in France. It is likely that a French migrant worker, possibly one working for Victor Jay, knew the recipe and that William and Thomas Bowler perfected it for the prolific production of bowler hats, thus making their immortal mark on the development of the English gentleman's dress.<br>
<br>After his first wife's death, William Bowler returned to Denton, Lancashire, and married second, on 10 September 1860, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1807/8), daughter of Thomas Hulme. He died at West Street, Denton, on 9 February 1878. Thomas Bowler, who continued to run the business in London, was in 1881 living in Camberwell and employing 65 men, 60 women, and 14 boys. By 1891 he headed a household of eleven, residing at 14 Highbury New Park. He served as upper warden of the Worshipful Company of Feltmakers of the City of London and was due to become master when he died of jaundice during a holiday in Guernsey on 5 September 1893, aged sixty-seven. The Bowler dynasty of hat makers continued to thrive at 34 Southwark Bridge Road, and managed a work force of 600 by 1939. Disaster struck in 1940, when the factory was destroyed by two consecutive German air raids during the blitz. The business moved to Great Marlborough Street, London, and manufactured ladies' hats until 1962.<br>
<br>In the twentieth century the bowler hat took on many roles and became a British cultural icon. It became essential for Charlie Chaplin's satirical image, and personified the character John Steed, played by Patrick Mcgee, in the television series <span class="italic">The Avengers</span> in the 1960s, when it was a symbol not only of probity but also of swinging London. In the 1970s the hat became, on the head of John Cleese, in the television comedy series <span class="italic">Monty Python's Flying Circus</span>, a lightly satirical symbol of the British upper class. Worn by Alex (Malcolm McDowell) in Stanley Kubrick's film version of Anthony Burgess's novel <span class="italic">A Clockwork Orange</span> (published 1962, filmed 1971), it became an attribute of gang violence and brutality.<br>
<br>Though the exact nature of the Bowlers' connection remains elusive, with perhaps the formula for stiffening felt forming their part in its creation, the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> records that, at least from 1861, a low-crowned stiff felt hat had become known as a bowler.<br>
