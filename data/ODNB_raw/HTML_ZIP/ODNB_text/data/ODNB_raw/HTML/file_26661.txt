<span class="headword">Scrots <span class="st"> [Stretes]</span>,  Guillim</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1537&#150;1553), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, described as a &#145;Dutchman&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 30198, fol. 22<i>v</i>), was probably a native of the southern Netherlands; his name is spelt Stretes in some sources. Nothing is known of his early life, training, or parentage. The first part of his career appears to have been spent at the Habsburg court in Bruges, where he was appointed painter to Mary of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands, on 1 September 1537, at a salary of 6 sous per day. During his employment with her he is documented as having produced portraits of the Habsburg emperor Charles V and the empress Isabella. These are not known to survive. Surviving portraits of the young archdukes Maximilian (later Emperor Maximilian II) and Ferdinand (both Kunsthistorisches Museum, Schloss Ambras, Innsbruck) are convincingly attributed to Scrots on the basis of stylistic comparison with his English work, and may have been painted at the diet of Speyer in 1544. They are three-quarter length oil portraits on panel, with a typically Netherlandish attention to surface detail and pattern, and the illusionistic rendition of texture, a sympathetic if not penetrating approach to the characterization of his sitters, and a striking colour scheme: both boys are shown in black and gold costumes against a bright green background. Scrots is last recorded in the Low Countries as a witness to a deposition on 24 October 1544, in which all the other witnesses are citizens of Antwerp, and so it is assumed that he was in Antwerp at that time.<br>
<br>Scrots went to England to take up a position as a painter at the court of Henry VIII probably in the second half of 1545. Here he was paid the very substantial annual salary of &pound;62 10<i>s</i>. from at least Michaelmas that year, making him the highest paid artist at the English court at the time. He was presumably regarded as the successor to Hans Holbein the younger, who had died in 1543, but who had been paid a much lower salary of &pound;30 in his position as king's painter. It is likely that Scrots's previous court employment enabled him to command this high salary, whereas Holbein had not worked at a court before going to England.<br>
<br>Various portraits produced in England after Holbein's death, of greatly varying quality and style, have been attributed in the past to Scrots, but there is little secure evidence linking him to specific paintings. The only documentary evidence of his work in England is a payment from the king and council in March 1551 for three full-length portraits, two of Edward VI for Sir Philip Hoby and Sir John Mason and one of Henry Howard, earl of Surrey (1517?&#150;1547). Sir Philip Hoby and Sir John Mason were both ambassadors, Hoby having been appointed ambassador to the court of Charles V in April 1548 and Mason to the court of Henry II of France in 1550. Both men were involved in negotiations for a marriage between Edward VI and Princess Elizabeth of France, which came to a head in May 1551, and it seems most likely that the portraits of the young king painted for these men were produced in connection with these negotiations. A group of surviving portraits of Edward VI, in oil on panel, is probably correctly associated with Scrots and his studio on the basis of this payment. Five of these are full lengths, the most accomplished being those now at Hampton Court Palace and the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris. The approach to the modelling of the young king's face in the Louvre portrait is particularly close to that of Archduke Ferdinand in the portrait at Schloss Ambras.<br>
<br>The portrait of the earl of Surrey, who had been charged with treason and executed in January 1547, has proved more elusive. It is described in the 1551 payment as &#145;a picture of the late earle of Surrey attainted and by the counsailes comanndement fetched from the said Gwillms howse&#146;  (Royal MS, 18, 124, fol. 69<i>v</i>, BL). It has been suggested that it may correspond to a large full-length portrait on canvas that was in the collection of Surrey's descendants, the dukes of Norfolk (now belonging to the National Portrait Gallery, but still at Arundel Castle). However the latter painting is perhaps more likely to have been produced by an Italian artist working in the style of Giovanni Battista Moroni. A portrait on panel, showing the head only, but probably a fragment of a larger painting (NPG), may be a better candidate for all that remains of Scrots's portrait of Surrey; Netherlandish in style, like the portraits at Schloss Ambras it has a plain bright green background and the modelling of the face is sophisticated and sensitive.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most remarkable work attributed to Scrots is a portrait in distorted perspective of Edward VI (NPG). This type of &#145;anamorphic&#146; portrait was popular in the Habsburg courts in the early sixteenth century; designed to amaze the viewer and display the artist's skills, the distorted image appears unintelligible at first glance, but viewed from the correct angle, or using a special viewing device, the perspective is corrected and the portrait resolves itself into legibility. The antiquarian George Vertue recorded in the early eighteenth century seeing the signature &#145;Guihelmus pingebat&#146; on the original frame  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 1.54) and the conjunction of the name, date, royal sitter and Habsburg court associations suggests strongly that Scrots should be identified as the artist.<br>
<br>As far as can be judged by his small surviving <i>&#339;uvre</i>, Scrots's contribution to English art was to bring the glamorous Habsburg court style briefly to the court of Henry VIII, and then to that of Edward VI, forming a link between the sophisticated portraiture of Hans Holbein and the flatter, more abstracted Anglo-Netherlandish style that characterized the painting of the Elizabethan court. He adopted the pose of Hans Holbein's full-length mural portrait of Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace for his paintings of the young Edward VI, but Scrots's strong lighting and simple but striking colour schemes give his portraits a flatter appearance, emphasizing their decorative surfaces. His work in turn influenced that of Hans Eworth, the Netherlandish artist who was most dominant in England immediately after Scrots; in its approach to modelling the face, for example, Eworth's portrait of Lord Darnley (1555; Scot. NPG) is particularly comparable to Scrots's portrait of Edward VI in the Louvre.<br>
<br>It is not known why Scrots disappears from the court records after 1553; his last salary payment in England was made for a period ending in June of that year. The termination of his court employment may of course be connected with the succession of Mary I to the throne, but there is currently no evidence as to whether he left the country for good, or remained until his death at some later date. No paintings postdating the reign of Edward VI have been convincingly attributed to him.<br>
