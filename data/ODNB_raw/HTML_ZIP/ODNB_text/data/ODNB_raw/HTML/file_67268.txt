<span class="headword">Hilton,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1679&#150;1688), <span class="occ">informer</span>, was of unknown parents. Little is known of him prior to his notoriety in the 1680s as an informer against nonconformists. The Quakers tried to discover his origins in order to expose his misdeeds. Apparently his roots were among the Roman Catholic minor gentry of Westmorland, where he was a crony of the royalist Sir Richard Sandford, baronet, of Howgill Castle. After a career of barratry and unpaid debts he moved to London during the 1670s. There he kept an ale house in Fetter Lane and was said to have seduced into marriage and then deserted the under-age daughter of a man whom he defrauded. He was possibly at some stage a soldier, and called himself Captain Hilton.<br>
<br>Hilton's moment came in May 1682, when he and his inseparable brother, <a name="cosubject_67247"></a><span class="headword">George Hilton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1682&#150;1686), <span class="occ">informer</span>, secured the king's verbal commission to put the laws against protestant dissenters into execution. For the next four years the Hilton gang terrorized London dissent, monopolizing prosecutions for nonconformity, and securing the closure of meeting-houses of every denomination. Around forty gang members are identifiable, fifteen of them women, who secured warrants and arrests, and served as witnesses, bailiffs, and bouncers. Several members were especially prominent in these activities: Gabriel Shadd, Christopher Smith, John and Hester Collingwood, and Eleanor Shafto. Collingwood and Shafto were illiterate; Shafto was Hilton's mistress. They operated chiefly under the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> of 1670, which allowed informers one third of the fine levied upon attenders at illegal worship. The gang raised tens of thousands of pounds in fines. On Sundays they tracked down conventicles (the women sometimes feigning religious conversion); on weekdays they distrained victims' goods for non-payment of fines. No denomination was spared, and the principal leaders of dissent were their victims, including William Penn, Richard Baxter, George Fox, and Stephen Lobb. Once, in 1684, Hilton played for the highest stakes, when his female spies were crown witnesses in a treason charge against Thomas Rosewall for words spoken in a sermon. Rosewall was convicted, but the king was persuaded that it would be impolitic to execute a man on the evidence of Hilton's gang.<br>
<br>Hilton's campaign belonged to secular politics too, for it was part of the tory purge of whigs in the wake of Charles II's dismissal of parliament in 1681 and the royal coup against the whig governors of the City of London in 1682. Hilton carried the purge to the level of parish officers, prosecuting constables who connived at dissent. He also brought a charge against the whig plutocrat Sir Robert Clayton but the case fell through when Clayton undermined Hilton's credentials as a witness.<br>
<br>It is probably unique for an informer such as Hilton to produce a newspaper advertising his exploits. Thirty issues of the <span class="italic">Conventicle Courant</span> appeared between July 1682 and February 1683. As propaganda it was a junior partner to Sir Roger L'Estrange's <span class="italic">Observator</span> and Nathaniel Thompson's <span class="italic">True Domestic Intelligence</span>. Hilton had the backing of tories in high places: Sir George Jeffreys (lord chancellor from 1685), and particularly Sir Thomas Jenner, recorder of London. The shady ecclesiastical lawyer Sir Thomas Pinfold, &#145;the spiritual dragoon&#146;, connects Hilton with the Anglican hierarchy, which valued the gang's services but took care to avoid public avowals. Archbishop Sancroft is reported to have &#145;excused&#146; Hilton, for &#145;there must be some crooked timber used in building a ship&#146;  (Whitehead, 500).<br>
<br>The dissenters played an adept game of cat and mouse with Hilton. They exposed and vilified him in <span class="italic">A Letter to Hilton, the Grand Informer</span> (1683) and <span class="italic">The English Guzman, or, Captain Hilton's Memoirs</span> (1683). They brought cases for debt and blackmail. They instructed constables how to evade the law's requirements&#151;notably in Thomas Ellwood's <span class="italic">Caution to Constables</span> (1683). Starting up the cry in the streets, &#145;Informer, Informer&#146;, they summoned up belligerent crowds of apprentices, sending the Hiltons scurrying for the city militia. But his reign of intimidation was not broken until James II adopted a policy of religious toleration. In 1686 Hilton met his nemesis in the Quaker shopkeeper George Whitehead, who secured the king's commission for a public inquiry, held in June. Whitehead's case notes are in the Friends' (Quaker) archives. Gang members were then prosecuted for perjury and peculation; several were pilloried and flogged. Hilton was reduced to penury and obscurity. In 1688 Henry Care's tolerationist newspaper <span class="italic">Public Occurrences</span> reported him to be living incognito. Hilton then disappears from the record, though he haunted City tories in the election of 1690, when whig pamphlets urged voters to reject candidates who had provided him with warrants. His date of death is unknown, as is that of his brother George.<br>
<br>During the final attempt in English history to coerce the nation into religious uniformity, Hilton was at the sharp end. An odious thug, a liar, drunk, blackmailer, and rapacious fraudster, he suited the tory magnates of the 1680s. His campaign reveals the extent and the limits of law enforcement at the height of Stuart authority.<br>
