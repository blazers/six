<span class="headword">Ashpitel,  William Hurst</span>  (1776&#150;1852), <span class="occ">architect and surveyor</span>, of unknown parentage, was a pupil of Daniel Asher Alexander. He probably worked with Alexander on the great series of warehouses designed for the London Dock Company, submitted to them in 1800, and was involved in their construction. He is also thought to have acted as assistant to John Rennie, engineer of the London Dock Company, working with him on the construction of the Kennet and Avon Canal, built 1794&#150;1810.<br>
<br>Ashpitel went into partnership with the architect James Savage, who had also been articled to Alexander. With Savage he designed the chapel of St John-at-Jerusalem (later enlarged to become St John's Church) in Well Street, South Hackney, built 1806&#150;10. The partnership seems not to have lasted very long and Ashpitel then practised independently as an architect and also as a surveyor. On 6 November 1807 he married at Christ Church Greyfriars Elizabeth Peter, with whom he had three children: the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/766/', "Arthur Ashpitel (1807&#150;1869)")</script>, William Hurst Ashpitel (<i>b</i>. 1811), and Elizabeth Ashpitel (<i>b</i>. 1812). Although he undertook some architectural commissions&#151;notably Chart Park, near Dorking, Surrey, for Sir Charles Talbot (dem. 1819 by Thomas Hope to enlarge his park at Deepdene), Shenley rectory, Hertfordshire, and The Grove, Worth, Sussex&#151;he gave up practice early in order to devote himself to improvement and development of Hackney, where he owned property. From 1812 he lived in a house in what became Clapton Square and may have been responsible for overseeing the building of the square. He also owned and leased land in the area, including (from 1821) brick-earth fields which he seems to have worked. In 1822 he undertook to design and build (for &pound;2000) Shacklewell vicarage house for Archdeacon Watson, incumbent of St John's Church, south Hackney. He later became involved with Hackney Church of England school, opened 1830, which was partially built on his property in Back Lane (later Clarence Road) and which he almost certainly designed. Ashpitel was elected a member of the Surveyors' Club in 1806. He left his profession rather early in life, and died at his home in Clapton Square, Hackney, on 23 April 1852.<br>
