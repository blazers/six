<span class="headword">Taylour, Lord  William Desmond</span>  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at Pennington House, Milford Road, Lymington, Hampshire, on 3 January 1904, the younger son of Geoffrey Thomas Taylour, fourth marquess of Headfort (1878&#150;1943), a landowner, later senator of the Irish Free State, and fellow of the Linnean Society, and his wife, Rose 
    (Rosie; <i>d</i>. 1958)
  , an actress (&#145;a teacher of music&#146;) at the Gaiety Theatre, London, daughter of Charles Chamberlain Boote, a comedian, of Luton, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Marie. Taylour was brought up at Headfort, co. Meath, and then followed his elder brother, Terence Geoffrey Thomas, who later succeeded as fifth marquess, to Harrow School (1917&#150;21). However, while his brother went up to Oxford, Lord William Taylour, as he was styled, though passionate about archaeology, was encouraged to pursue a career, first in the diplomatic service (1921&#150;2), and then in banking on Wall Street, New York. He returned to London where he was the business manager of the interior design company belonging to Maria Louisa Arnold.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Taylour served in the North African campaign, reaching the rank of captain in the 2nd Derbyshire yeomanry (TA). At the end of hostilities he was a member of the Allied Control Commission for Germany until 1947. Taylour then turned to archaeology; he described himself as &#145;a latecomer in the field&#146;  (W. D. Taylour, <span class="italic">The Mycenaeans</span>, rev. edn, 1983, 6). He was admitted to read archaeology and anthropology at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1947; he achieved a first class in part one (1949), and an upper second in part two (1950). Among the archaeological influences on him were Grahame Clark, the then Disney professor, and Glyn Daniel, then lecturer in archaeology.<br>
<br>Taylour had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, like his mother. While he was at Cambridge, his sister, Lady Millicent, introduced him to Father Gilbey, the Roman Catholic chaplain in the University of Cambridge. Gilbey's talks at Fisher House were to influence Taylour's thinking. A contemporary at St Edmund House, a Roman Catholic residence, recalled Taylour as &#145;A very good Catholic in a balanced kind of way &hellip; he would attend Mass in the Chapel not every day, but every other day&#146;  (Stewart). Taylour served as treasurer to the Cambridge University Catholic Association, and was later made a knight commander of the order of St Gregory the Great.<br>
<br>Taylour's earliest archaeological work in the Mediterranean was in 1948 at Sabrathah in Tripolitania working under Kathleen Kenyon and J. B. Ward-Perkins, the director of the British School at Rome. After graduating Taylour wrote a doctoral dissertation on Mycenaean pottery in Italy (doctorate awarded 1955). He took part in the joint Ashmolean Museum and Sydney University excavation of Myrtou-Pighades on Cyprus under the direction of Joan Du Plat Taylor (1950&#150;51); he was responsible for the publication of the Iron Age pottery.<br>
<br>Taylour visited Greece in 1949. After the completion of the work on Cyprus, Taylour worked on the renewed British excavations at Mycenae in 1952 and 1953 under the direction of Alan John Bayard Wace, publishing the work in the area round the Perseia spring in the <span class="italic">Annual of the British School at Athens</span> (1955). Taylour's interest in the links between Greece and Italy during the Late Bronze Age brought an opportunity to work with Carl William Blegen (1887&#150;1971) of the University of Cincinnati on the Bronze Age site at the &#145;palace of Nestor&#146; (Ano Englianos) in western Messenia. Taylour joined the excavations for six seasons (1953&#150;5, 1957&#150;9), and was responsible for the excavation of some of the more significant tombs; his findings were published in <span class="italic">The Palace of Nestor at Pylos in Western Messenia</span>, volume 3 (1973).<br>
<br>Recognition of Taylour's contribution to Late Bronze Age Greece was confirmed by his election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (1958). His doctoral dissertation was published as <span class="italic">Mycenean Pottery in Italy, and Adjacent Areas</span> (1958). Taylour's archaeological career then took a dramatic turn. British involvement with the excavation of Mycenae had drawn to a close with Wace's death in 1957 as well as the uneasy political situation over Cyprus. A committee (consisting of C. Martin Robertson, the chairman of the British School at Athens, Elisabeth B. Wace, and Taylour) was established to supervise the work at Mycenae, and in 1959 Taylour resumed the excavations in conjunction with the Greek Archaeological Society, working first with John Papademetriou, and then, after his death in 1963, with George E. Mylonas (1964, 1966, 1968, 1969).<br>
<br>The discovery of further Linear B tablets was announced promptly in <span class="italic">Antiquity</span> (1961), and Taylour contributed to J. Chadwick, ed., <span class="italic">The Mycenae Tablets, III</span> (1963). Among the other finds was what was later recognized as a cult site within the walls of the acropolis, promptly announced in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1969&#150;70) and <span class="italic">Antiquity</span> (1969&#150;70). The clay figures from this complex were described by him as &#145;perfectly hideous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). The complexity of the site at Mycenae, and the protracted excavations, called for a new approach to the publication of the finds, announced in the <span class="italic">Annual of the British School at Athens</span> (1969). In fact the first volume, prepared by Taylour, in the monograph series <span class="roman">Well built Mycenae: Helleno-British Excavations within the Citadel at Mycenae, 1959&#150;1969</span>, did not appear until 1981. Further volumes in the series, with Taylour acknowledged as co-author, include <span class="italic">The South House and Annexe</span> (vol. 9), <span class="italic">The Temple</span> (vol. 10; 1999), and <span class="italic">The Room with the Fresco</span> (vol. 11). The research for this ongoing work is supported by the Mediterranean Archaeological Trust, established by Taylour. Taylour's research trips included driving groups of students to Greece and showing them various sites along the way.<br>
<br>Taylour also directed the excavation, over six seasons, of the Bronze Age site of Hagios Stephanos in southern Laconia (1959 to 1977). The preliminary results were published in the <span class="italic">Annual of the British School at Athens</span> (1972). The finds from the site demonstrated the link between Crete and the Greek mainland. Taylour's love of Late Bronze Age Greece is revealed in <span class="italic">The Mycenaeans</span> (1964), a book Glyn Daniel had to persuade him to write. A revised second edition appeared in 1983 which took account of the cult site at Mycenae. The volume was translated into Italian (1966).<br>
<br>In his later years Taylour continued to work on the publication of the Mycenae excavations, and his last research trip to Greece was made in 1988. The development of lung cancer took its toll, and Taylour died at his home, St Aubyns, Woodlands Road, Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, on 2 December 1989. He never married. Ironically, Taylour's death coincided with a conference in Athens on the archaeological work of Wace and Blegen; the subsequent volume, Carol Zerner, ed., <span class="italic">Wace and Blegen: Pottery as Evidence for Trade in the Aegean Bronze Age, 1939&#150;1989</span> (1993), was dedicated to Taylour, acknowledging his work establishing links between mainland Greece and Italy.<br>
<br>As a field archaeologist Taylour was &#145;a striking figure with his distinctive Egyptianizing headdress (to protect his bald head), shorts, and bush shirt (with the contents of the pockets carefully organized)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Report of the British School at Athens</span>, 1988&#150;9, 41). He has been described as &#145;an aristocratic scholar of the old school &hellip; something of Lord Peter Wimsey in Lord William Taylour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>).<br>
