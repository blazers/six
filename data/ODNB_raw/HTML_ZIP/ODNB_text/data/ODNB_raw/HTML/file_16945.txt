<span class="headword">Loggan,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1634, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">artist and engraver</span>, was born in Danzig, Poland, where he was baptized in the Calvinist church of St Peter and St Paul on 27 August 1634. He was the only son of John Loggan (<i>b</i>. 1608), a merchant, of a family of Scottish descent who had settled in Oxfordshire in the sixteenth century, and his wife, Margaret, the widow of John or Johann Klinge. Loggan is said to have learned engraving from Willem Hondius, who settled in Danzig in 1636, and, after Hondius's death in 1652, from the younger Crispijn de Passe (<i>c</i>.1597&#150;1670) in Amsterdam. He apparently intended to continue his studies in France and Italy, but he settled in London between 1656, when some of his engravings were published in Amsterdam, and 1658, when he gained recognition through a pencil portrait of Oliver Cromwell, drawn shortly before the lord protector's death. He engraved a view of St Paul's Cathedral for Daniel King in 1658, and subsequently engraved a title-page to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> (1662) and some plates for William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Origines judiciales</span> (1666). In the early 1660s he became well known for his black lead (plumbago) portraits drawn on vellum from life, and he succeeded William Faithorne as the best-known exponent of this genre. The portraits, which include representations of Charles II and numerous Restoration courtiers and divines, are highly accomplished and full of character, and several of them were engraved. On 15 June 1663, when he was living in the parish of St Bride, Fleet Street, he married Anna (<i>c</i>.1644&#150;1699), the daughter of John Jordan of the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, whose family owned property at Kencot, Oxfordshire. They had eight children, one of whom, John, became a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and rector of Hanwell, Oxfordshire; another, Justinian, was a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards.<br>
<br>In 1665 Loggan and his wife left London because of the plague and settled at Nuffield, Oxfordshire. An engraved portrait of an Oxford innkeeper, <span class="italic">Mother Louse</span>&#151;supposedly the last woman in England to wear a ruff&#151;brought him to the attention of the members of Oxford University, and he soon built up a flourishing local portrait practice. He is mentioned several times in the diaries of Anthony Wood, who appears to have introduced him to, among others, Elias Ashmole and John Aubrey, whose portraits he drew. By 1669 he had moved to Holywell Street, Oxford, where he had a &#145;rolling press&#146; which he sold to Oxford University, and on 30 March 1669, probably through the influence of John Fell, he was appointed engraver to the university, with an annual salary of 20<i>s</i>.; his first official commission was for a pair of plates of the newly built Sheldonian Theatre, where the university press was housed. In 1672 he was made a member of the university, and he was naturalized in 1675. A book of plates of academic dress (<span class="italic">Reverendis &hellip; doctoribus academiae Oxoniensis haec omnium ordinium [sic] habituumque academicorum exemplaria</span>, 1674) has usually been ascribed to Loggan, though the plates are not signed; he and his assistants also engraved title-pages and plates for some of the university press's books. But the main legacy of his time in Oxford is his <span class="italic">Oxonia illustrata</span> (1675), a set of bird's-eye views of all the colleges, academic halls, and university buildings, together with a map. It was intended to accompany Wood's <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford</span> (1674), and was presented along with it by the university in the late seventeenth century to distinguished visitors to Oxford. Influenced by the work of Wenceslas Hollar, Loggan's meticulously detailed views were the first accurate representation of all the buildings and gardens of the university, and they have been an invaluable quarry for historians, antiquaries, and topographers ever since. In 1676 he engraved Christopher Wren's design for the new library at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in the same year he began work on <span class="italic">Cantabrigia illustrata</span>, a comparable volume of plates of all the Cambridge colleges and university buildings, for the production of which he was given a workshop and press at Trinity College; the book was published in 1690, when he was made engraver to the university. Some of his prints are preserved at Worcester College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Loggan moved from Oxford to London in 1675 and settled in a house in Leicester Fields (now Leicester Square) in a row on the St Martin's Lane side, next to the Golden Head. Here he continued to draw and engrave portraits; he also let rooms in his house to &#145;persons of Quality who desir to have Lodgings&#146;  (Loggan to Sir Thomas Isham, 21 Oct 1675, <span class="italic">Connoisseur</span>, 152, 1963, 85) and acted as an agent for portraits by Sir Peter Lely and members of his circle and for books and furniture. His clients included Sir Thomas Isham of Lamport (Northamptonshire) and his younger brother and heir, Sir Justinian Isham, to whom he wrote in 1682 that he was &#145;so plaged with besunes [business] more than ever I have bin&#146;  (Loggan to Sir Justinian Isham, 12 Sept 1682, <span class="italic">Connoisseur</span>, 154, 1963, 88). His portrait practice suffered from the rise of mezzotint engraving in the late 1670s, but he produced some mezzotints of his own about 1683 and two maps in 1687. Vertue recorded, but cast doubt upon, a story that &#145;he hurt his sight so in delineating of King's College Chappel [Cambridge] &hellip; that he engraved but little afterwards&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.98).<br>
<br>In producing his plates of Oxford and Cambridge, Loggan was assisted by Robert White, who later became an accomplished portraitist in his own right, by Michael Burghers (1648&#150;?1724), who succeeded him as engraver to Oxford University, and by another Dutchman, Everardus Kickius (&#145;one Kickers&#146;), who, according to Vertue, accompanied Loggan to Scotland, where they produced plates for <span class="italic">Theatrum Scotiae</span>. Among other pupils and assistants were Abraham Blooteling (1640&#150;1690), Gerard Valck (1652&#150;1726), and Edward (le) Davis, who departed for France after Loggan's wife &#145;woud have him follow her in a Livery &amp; other servile offices, which he refus'd to do&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.29).<br>
<br>Loggan died at his house in Leicester Fields in July 1692 and was buried on 1 August 1692 at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He left debts of &pound;140, and, according to Vertue, &#145;little remaining substance &hellip; except for a few Copper graved plates&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.182). They were sold to a printseller, Henry Overton, who republished the engravings of Oxford and Cambridge on which Loggan's later fame has largely rested.<br>
