<span class="headword">Kingsley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grenfell]</span>,  Frances Eliza <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1814&#150;1891), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born at Taplow House, near Maidenhead, the eleventh child, and seventh and youngest daughter, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11486/', "Pascoe Grenfell (bap. 1761, d. 1838)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61181/', "Grenfell family")</script>], MP for Great Marlow, and his second wife, Georgiana St Leger, youngest daughter of Viscount Doneraile. The Grenfell family was originally Cornish and claimed a connection with Sir Richard Grenville. Pascoe Grenfell had amassed a substantial fortune through Welsh and Cornish mining interests, and his own second marriage into the aristocracy set the pattern for future alliances in the family which enhanced its growing prominence in finance, politics, and the army and navy. Fanny's nephews included a governor of the Bank of England (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38687/', "H. R. Grenfell")</script>) and a field marshal (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33561/', "F. W. Grenfell")</script>); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33564/', "Julian Grenfell")</script>, the poet, was a great-great-nephew.<br>
<br>As was common in well-to-do families, the Grenfell sons were sent to public schools but the daughters were educated privately. Fanny had opportunities to read widely in modern literatures and in history and theology. By the mid-1830s she was living at home with three devout, unmarried sisters. All were attracted to the Catholic spirituality revived within the Church of England under Tractarian influences, and considered forming or joining some kind of Anglican sisterhood similar to the Puseyite Park Village community established some years later, in 1845.<br>
<br>However, on 6 July 1839, when the family was staying at Braziers Park near Ipsden, Oxfordshire, Fanny met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15617/', "Charles Kingsley (1819&#150;1875)")</script>, five years her junior, then a rather wild Cambridge undergraduate. This encounter was fictionalized as the meeting of the lovely and learned Argemone with Lancelot Smith in Kingsley's first novel <span class="italic">Yeast</span> (1848), which was always Fanny's favourite. From this moment, later acclaimed as their true wedding day, the sisterhood project was doomed. Fanny's mother had died in 1818 and her father in 1838, so her ambitious half-brother Charles Pascoe had just become head of the family. In the course of a protracted courtship, carried on mainly by letter in the face of the stern disapproval of her brother and most of the Grenfell family, Fanny turned Kingsley's thoughts to ordination, introducing him to the writings of Coleridge, Carlyle, and F. D. Maurice, which became central to his religious outlook. It is clear from the startling mixture of religion and frank sexuality in Kingsley's sometimes vividly illustrated letters to Fanny from this period that almost from the outset the relationship involved powerful physical attraction and a corresponding defiance of celibate religious idealism. Despite all difficulties they were finally married by special licence in Bath on 10 January 1844.<br>
<br>Even then they could not live together until Kingsley was able to move from his Dorset curacy, held through the good offices of Fanny's brother-in-law, to become rector of Eversley in Hampshire. They moved into the damp and inconvenient rectory in May 1844. Here Fanny stayed for most of her married life. She played little part in Kingsley's public life in London and elsewhere, though they both attended the first women's suffrage meeting in 1869. Four children were born, Rose (1846), Maurice (1847), Mary (1852), and Grenville (1858), amid miscarriages and repeated periods of ill health. Holidays for convalescence added to constant financial worries. But Fanny was usually a cheerful and supportive wife and mother, energetically involved with parish work and amanuensis for many of her husband's books. Dark-haired, heavy-featured but with beautiful eyes, almost Spanish in appearance, she was a good manager, kind and hospitable if sometimes daunting, regarded as the original of the redoubtable Eleanor in Kingsley's <span class="italic">Alton Locke</span> (1850).<br>
<br>In later life Fanny suffered from angina and was unable to accompany Kingsley on his travels to the West Indies and the United States. She was seriously ill after a heart attack in 1875, when her husband was also ill; though she recovered, he did not. Semi-invalid, she spent her widowhood at Tachbrook Mallory, near Leamington Spa. Almost immediately she began work on <span class="italic">Charles Kingsley: his Letters and Memoirs of his Life</span> (1877), which was frequently reprinted. A popular abridged edition appeared in 1879. She also edited four volumes of pious selections from Kingsley's writings. Subsequent biographers have complained of her uncritical attitude and her reticences and suppressions, including the omission of all reference to Kingsley's spendthrift brother Henry, whom she disliked, but she made available a great deal of interesting unpublished material and wrote with intelligent sympathy, insisting that her argumentative husband was a prophetic teacher. She continued to take an informed interest in theological controversy, and her compilation <span class="italic">From Death to Life</span> (1887) convincingly demonstrated that Kingsley had anticipated contemporary liberal discussion of life after death. Fanny died on 12 December 1891 at Tachbrook Mallory.<br>
