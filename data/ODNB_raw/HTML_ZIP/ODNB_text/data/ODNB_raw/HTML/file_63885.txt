<span class="headword">Reeves,  Marian</span>  (1879&#150;1961), <span class="occ">feminist activist</span>, was born on 19 February 1879 at 17 Victoria Terrace, Lewisham, London, the daughter of Albert Reeves, a carpenter, and his wife, Emily Hooper Pratt. No records of her early life appear to have survived, but by the time of the First World War she had become active in the feminist movement. Of particular note was her involvement with the Women's Freedom League, the militant suffragist society which under the leadership of Charlotte Despard had in 1907 broken away from the Pankhurst-dominated Women's Social and Political Union; by 1914 it had developed into a body campaigning on a wide range of feminist issues apart from the vote, which it continued to do until its demise in 1961. Marian Reeves was not involved in the initial years of the league (which she later regretted); she joined the league in 1909, and was a member of the Clapham branch, but by 1918 she was already secretary of its Kensington branch. Later she was elected to its national executive and eventually became the league's last president.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Marian Reeves was involved with the Minerva Publishing Company, the Women's Freedom League's publishing branch, and about 1924 she took over the running of the Minerva Club in Brunswick Square, in the Bloomsbury area of London. This residential club had been established by Dr Elizabeth Knight and Mrs Fisher in 1920 as a social centre for members of the Women's Freedom League, and it became the league's headquarters when the lease on the league's own premises at 144 High Holborn ran out in the 1950s. Here she organized many social and fund-raising activities for the league, and for visitors, particularly women from overseas.<br>
<br>Especially notable were her &#145;tea and politics meetings&#146; (which later became &#145;supper meetings&#146;) when parliament was in session in order to give women (and men) an opportunity to discuss current legislation, and the birthday parties held for Mrs Despard until her death in 1939, for which Mrs Despard came over from her home in Ireland. Marian Reeves's hospitality to feminists of all persuasions at the Minerva Club earned her the sobriquet &#145;the hostess of the women's movement&#146;.<br>
<br>Marian Reeves also became something of a Bloomsbury figure, including among her friends George Bernard Shaw, Jawaharlal Nehru, E. M. Forster, Harriet Cohen, and Emmeline and Frederick Pethick-Lawrence. She also championed the cause of the small hotels and boarding-houses, then so abundant in Bloomsbury, especially during the Second World War. These businesses had been damaged not only by bombing but by the evacuation of many of their tenants, and Marian Reeves founded the London Emergency Apartment Keepers' Society (known by its initials), which campaigned successfully for the suspension of their rent and rates for the duration of the war.<br>
<br>Marian Reeves was active in a number of other feminist organizations besides the Women's Freedom League, including the Nationality of Married Women Committee, the Equal Pay Campaign Committee, and the Women Peers Committee. She was also a soroptimist. She served on the executive of the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (campaigning against state regulation of prostitution), on the committee of the Open Door Council (campaigning against legislation that restricted women's right to work in certain occupations), and on the women's advisory council of the United Nations Association. She was an early vice-chairman of the British Commonwealth League, and later of the Status of Women Committee. She felt a special commitment to the International Alliance of Women, whose congresses she regularly attended. In 1961, although in poor health, she visited Dublin for the alliance's congress, and while there placed flowers from the Women's Freedom League on the grave of Charlotte Despard in Glasnevin cemetery. A few days later, on an excursion by motor coach to Killarney on 30 August 1961, she collapsed and died at the railway station, Killarney. Her body was brought back from Ireland for cremation at the Golders Green crematorium on 5 September.<br>
<br>Marian Reeves had never married, devoting herself entirely to the women's cause. Her friend Kate O'Brien saw Marian Reeves as &#145;a <i>citizen</i>, with a highly developed civic sense&#146; and &#145;a walking manifestation of Voltaire's maxim: &#147;I hate what you are saying, but I will die for your right to say it&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Sept 1961). However, despite her sustained efforts on its behalf, the Women's Freedom League's numbers had been declining noticeably, especially after the Second World War, and in October 1961, deprived at last of her guiding hand, it finally voted itself out of existence.<br>
