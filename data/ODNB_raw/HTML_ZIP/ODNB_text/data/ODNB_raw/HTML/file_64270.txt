<span class="headword">Garstin,  Norman</span>  (1847&#150;1926), <span class="occ">landscape and genre painter</span>, was born on 28 August 1847 at Cahirconlish, co. Limerick, the only child of an Anglo-Irish army officer, Colonel William Garstin (1806&#150;1861), of the 83rd regiment of foot of the Irish army, and his wife, Mary Hastings Moore (1823&#150;1871). His father committed suicide when Garstin was young and, as his mother suffered from muscular paralysis, he was brought up by relatives (mainly an aunt at Fetard) in co. Limerick. He was sent to school in Jersey, where he attended the Victoria College, St Helier, and lived with another relative, Dr Norman Garstin.<br>
<br>Garstin studied engineering briefly at Queen's College, Cork, and then architecture, entering an architect's office in London. However, he found the profession of little interest, and in 1872 he set sail for the diamond mines of South Africa. He spent four years in Kimberley, where he shared a tent with Cecil Rhodes, and was employed for some of the time by the government secretary, Frederick St Leger. Later he went to Cape Town where he worked for St Leger as sub-editor on the newly established <span class="italic">Cape Times</span>. He returned to Ireland in 1877.<br>
<br>Soon after his return Garstin was blinded in one eye in a riding accident, although this incident did not deter him from his decision to become an artist. He studied in 1878&#150;9 in Antwerp, under Charles Verlat, and then between 1880 and 1883 in Paris in the studio of Carolus Duran. The influence of the northern tradition is reflected in the sombre palette of his early works, and his oils and watercolours include many canal and street scenes of such places as Delft and Bruges, as well as scenes of everyday life in Breton towns, in which he depicted local women in peasant costume. In Paris Garstin had the opportunity of seeing the work of the French impressionists: he is said to have met Degas, and in 1884 he wrote a critical appraisal of Edouard Manet for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Garstin exhibited widely in Britain from the early 1880s: at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, in 1882, at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1883, when he showed <span class="italic">Philomene</span>, in Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow, and in many London galleries, including the Fine Art Society, the Walker Gallery, and the Grosvenor Gallery. He exhibited with the New English Art Club in 1887. During this time Garstin travelled extensively. In 1882 he painted in Brittany, a place popular with English painters and where Jules Bastien-Lepage encouraged his fellow artists in <i>plein air</i> painting. The following year he went to Hy&egrave;res in the south of France, in 1884 to Italy (including Venice), and in 1885 to Morocco and Spain. The experience of these journeys found expression not only in the subject matter of Garstin's paintings of the 1880s but also in a developing interest in colour and the effects of sunlight and shadow, and in the creation of scenes with atmospheric effects, mystery, and mood. He also painted scenes of London in a free, sketchy style while staying there in the 1880s.<br>
<br>After his marriage to Louisa Fanny (Dochie) Jones on 14 July 1886, Garstin settled in Newlyn, Cornwall, welcomed by the colony of artists who, like himself, had trained on the continent, and who were also influenced by the work of Bastien-Lepage. He rented one of the new glass-covered studios on the Meadow (a plot of land bought for development to meet the needs of the growing number of artists), which he shared with his friend Frank Wright Bourdillon. Garstin and his wife later moved to Penzance, where they lived at 4 Wellington Terrace with their two sons, Crosbie (<i>b</i>. 1887) and Denys (<i>b</i>. 1890), and daughter, <a href="#cosubject_64270">Alethea [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Garstin was a friend of Stanhope Forbes, leader of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64487/', "Newlyn school")</script>, who described him as &#145;a distinguished looking Irishman with a delightful wit &hellip; tall and imposing and with a fine artistic insight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norman and Alethea Garstin</span>, 23). He became the intellectual mentor of the Newlyn artists, forward looking and refreshingly free of dogmatic ideas, believing in the freedom of expression of the individual as opposed to the hidebound conventions of other Victorian painters. However, Garstin was dogged by his impoverished financial circumstances, which forced him to combine painting with writing articles for journals and teaching. From 1899 he took sketching parties abroad, to such places as Quimperl&eacute;, Delft, and Normandy. Eventually he opened his own school&#151;the Penzance and District Art Students School, where Harold Harvey was a pupil.<br>
<br>Garstin's work followed two directions: anecdotal, studio paintings executed for large exhibitions such as the Royal Academy and lively, impressionistic oil studies painted from nature on small panels. He was inspired by the avant-garde work of Walter Sickert and J. A. M. Whistler, as well as by Japanese art with its sense of assymetry. <span class="italic">Woman Reading a Newspaper</span> (1891; Tate collection) is powerfully evocative in the manner of Sickert, while <span class="italic">Mounts Bay from Trewidden</span> (Tate collection) follows the Japanese compositional style. His most important work, <span class="italic">The Rain it Raineth every Day</span> (1889; Penzance Museum and Art Gallery), is strongly atmospheric and has a powerful sense of depth and space. <span class="italic">Her Signal</span> (exh. RA, 1892; Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro) is an anecdotal painting with a dual light source, one of Garstin's favourite devices. Many of Garstin's paintings, in both oil and watercolour, show a powerful interplay of sunlight and shadow reminiscent of the French impressionists. The reviewer of an exhibition held at the Walker Gallery, Bond Street, in 1909 encapsulated this aspect of the artist's work, saying: &#145;His directness of statement and freshness of handling give to his studies of nature a definite significance as frank records of simple facts, and make them decoratively pleasing without diminishing their value as realities&#146;  (&#145;Studio talk&#146;, 227). His later works were more anecdotal and included scenes of upper-class life&#151;for example, <span class="italic">The Last Dance</span>&#151;and were designed to have greater saleability. Garstin remained in Penzance for the rest of his life, although he visited Canada in 1892, when he painted the opening of the Canadian Pacific Railway. He died at Wellington Terrace on 22 June 1926, survived by his wife.<br>

<a name="cosubject_64270"></a><span class="headword">(Mary) Alethea Dochie Garstin</span>  (1894&#150;1978), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born Mary Dochie Garstin on 1 June 1894, the third child of Norman Garstin and his wife, Louisa. She was trained as a painter by her father and accompanied him on many of his trips abroad, travelling round France with him as a child on the handlebars of his bicycle. She also painted with her friend the Cornish painter Dod Proctor.<br>
<br>Garstin's first Royal Academy exhibit was hung when she was eighteen and so impressed the president, Edward Poynter, that he asked to meet her. Thereafter she exhibited regularly in the 1920s and 1930s. Although she was based in Penzance until 1960, she travelled to northern France, Italy, Morocco, Kenya, and the Caribbean. She had a very fine tonal sense and accurately reproduced the hot, intense colours of Morocco and the West Indies in contrast to the cooler, more muted tones of scenes of Cornwall or Brittany. She worked directly on to the canvas with a freedom of brushstrokes and light touch, using square hogs' hair brushes.<br>
<br>In 1960 Garstin moved to the Old Poor House, at Zennor, on the Penwith north coast. She was one of the major painters of the Cornish school in the first half of the twentieth century. She died at her home on 23 January 1978, just before a major exhibition of her work and that of her father, entitled &#145;Two Impressionists, Father and Daughter&#146;, was held in St Ives. Her work is represented in Bristol City Art Gallery and Plymouth City Art Gallery.<br>
