<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Menzies,  John</span>  (1808&#150;1879), <span class="occ">wholesale distributor and newsagent</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of John Menzies, merchant, and his wife, Catherine Lindsay. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh. After a stiff and joyless apprenticeship (1823&#150;30) to an Edinburgh bookseller named Sutherland, he moved to London, where he worked (December 1831 until February 1833) for Charles Tilt, a Fleet Street publisher of a famous <span class="roman">Miniature Library</span>. In consequence of his father's sudden death he returned to Edinburgh, and in 1833 opened a small shop at 61 Princes Street selling books, stationery, and prints. London life had given him a taste for innovation. He made a daring experiment in selling <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> across his counter at a time when newspapers were customarily sold direct by their publishers to subscribers. In 1845 Menzies married Rossie Marr, daughter of a Leith merchant; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>At that time a retail bookseller acted as agent for a few publishers, whose books he exclusively displayed and sold; there were only loose connections between London publishers and Edinburgh retailers owing to the difficulties of travel. To remedy this situation Menzies inaugurated a wholesale book department, his chief business being on behalf of Tilt and (from 1837) Chapman and Hall. He secured the agency for <span class="italic">Punch</span> magazine (1841). He built up a prosperous business, although he never showed great ambitions and received some of his finest satisfactions from meeting or corresponding with literary figures like Charles Dickens. He was Edinburgh agent for the sale of <span class="italic">Mr Humphrey's Clock</span>, and for all of Dickens's works in east Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1835 Menzies issued his first trade stocklist, and from 1845 circulated a monthly catalogue to country buyers and other interested parties. He was irritable with customers who delayed settling their accounts, and implacable in pursuing small debts. He enjoyed publishing as a sideline of his business, and issued a series of Scottish guidebooks and books of Scottish views. His most lavish production was <span class="italic">The Costumes of the Clans</span> (1845) by the troublesome John Carter Allen, written in the name of John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, soi-disant Count d'Albanie.<br>
<br>For a time Menzies ran an export department, but his most lucrative business was in railway bookstalls, of which he opened his first in 1857. These bookstalls proliferated, and he also recruited boys carrying baskets of reading matter to stand on platforms to service the passengers of through trains. Such were the rewards of railway station business that he abandoned his shop and moved to new warehouse premises on Hanover Street, Edinburgh, in 1859. John Menzies &amp; Co. was formed as a partnership in 1867. A Glasgow wholesale branch was opened in 1868, and branches were set up in other Scottish towns during 1872&#150;3. John Menzies died of heart failure on 6 December 1879 at his home, 3 Grosvenor Crescent, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Menzies' elder son, <a name="cosubject_49247"></a><span class="headword">John Ross Menzies</span>  (1852&#150;1935), <span class="occ">wholesale distributor and newsagent</span>, was born on 17 September 1852 at 28 North Nelson Street, Edinburgh. He was a pawky, industrious Scot with foresight and ambition. Whereas his father had enjoyed the personal contacts of bookselling and wholesaling, he had a hard-headed interest in commercial matters. His driving force confirmed Menzies as the principal &#145;multiple&#146; of newsagencies and booksellers in Scotland equivalent to the firms of W. H. Smith in England and of Eason in Ireland. He shared Smith's terror of handling salacious or lurid reading material. Local Scottish booksellers and newsagents resented the expansion of Menzies railway bookstalls, which were exempt from early-closing legislation, rates, and taxes. The large, prominent Menzies kiosks at the great urban termini were popular as rendezvous with generations of Scottish travellers and lovers. J. R. Menzies together with his brother, Charles Thompson Menzies (1858&#150;1943), extended the company's wholesale warehouses to Dundee, Carlisle, and Aberdeen. The company opened its first English outlet, a railway bookstall at Carlisle, in 1888, although an informal understanding was later reached with W. H. Smith that neither company would invade the other's business territory. Menzies' annual profits averaged about &pound;8000 in the 1880s. The firm continued in a small way as publishers until 1905, the last book appearing under their imprint being <span class="italic">Horsebreaking</span>, a monograph on the schooling of ponies by the marchioness of Breadalbane. The business was constituted as a limited company in 1906, at which date it operated 357 railway bookstalls (second only in the United Kingdom to W. H. Smith). John Menzies became chairman and joint managing director of the company in 1906. The company began advertising at Edinburgh in 1913 (though not until 1926 in Glasgow), which stimulated the wholesaling business. But the 1920s were a period of stagnation: John Menzies retired as joint managing director in 1927 and as chairman in 1932.<br>
<br>The Menzies brothers worked long hours and preferred to eat sandwiches rather than leave their desks for lunch. They were patriarchal, sternly benevolent employers who devised incentives for their staff, including the payment of quarterly commissions. They started a rambling club in 1886, and were proud of their social and sports clubs. The most junior staff could rise through the management to the board of directors.<br>
<br>When young, John Ross Menzies yachted on the Clyde; later he was a devoted golfer. He had a craggy, forbidding appearance, shunned the limelight, and never married. He died of arteriosclerosis on 5 March 1935 at West Links House, North Berwick. The firm continued to be a family concern, under the direction of the children of his brother Charles.<br>
