<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dent,  Joseph Malaby</span>  (1849&#150;1926), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born at 3 Archer Street, Darlington, on 30 August 1849, the tenth child of George Dent, a house-painter, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Railton. Joseph Dent attended a Wesleyan school until the age of thirteen. He was briefly an apprentice printer, but proved so inept at that trade that he turned to bookbinding. Dent was a product of the autodidact culture that flourished among self-improving Victorian artisans. His own father had taught music and sold musical instruments as a sideline, and Dent himself discovered Walter Scott's novels while still at school; at the age of fifteen he became enamoured of literature when he spoke before a chapel mutual improvement society on Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Samuel Johnson</span>. That book would become the first volume in Dent's great series of cheap classics, <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>. In August 1867 Dent moved to London, where he worked for a bookbinder in Bucklersbury, out of Cheapside. He married Hannah (1840/41&#150;1887), daughter of George Wiggins, on 1 October 1870: they had four sons and two daughters. After the death of his first wife, he married Alexandra Campbell, daughter of Thomas Burnett Main, on 13 April 1889; they had four daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Dent set up his own London shop in Hoxton in 1872, and in 1881 he moved to larger premises at 69 Great Eastern Street, but that plant burnt down on new year's day 1888. The insurance money allowed him to rebuild, and the following autumn J. M. Dent &amp; Co. ventured into publishing. Dent had often been struck by the contrast between his handsome leather bindings and the spindly Victorian type on the pages they enclosed; he now embarked on a crusade to raise standards of book production. He published the <span class="roman">Temple Library</span>, starting with Charles Lamb's <span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span>, edited by Augustine Birrell, with etchings by Herbert Railton. This series of limited editions, produced on handmade paper, won both commercial success and the endorsement of the antiquarian bookseller Bernard Quaritch. In 1889 Dent put out an edition of <span class="italic">The Canterbury Tales</span> with hand-coloured illustrations; then he turned to uniform editions of the great English novelists. A trip to Florence and Siena in 1890 inspired the <span class="roman">Mediaeval Towns</span> series: illustrated books about the historic cities of Europe. There followed in 1893&#150;4 a magnificent edition of Sir Thomas Malory's <span class="italic">The Birth, Life and Acts of King Arthur</span>, with about 300 illustrations by the nineteen-year-old Aubrey Beardsley.<br>
<br>Dent recognized an enormous potential demand for cheap classics among self-educated readers. He was secretary of the Shakespeare Society at the Toynbee Hall settlement house, where the members had to cope with a confusing variety of editions, most of them badly edited and without helpful critical apparatus. Between 1894 and 1896 he produced the forty-volume <span class="roman">Temple Shakespeare</span>, edited by Israel Gollancz, with title-pages by Walter Crane, all for 1<i>s</i>. a volume; the series was to sell 5 million copies over the next forty years. There followed the <span class="roman">Temple Dramatists</span>, editions of other Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights; the <span class="roman">Temple Biographies</span>; the <span class="roman">Temple Greek and Latin Classics</span>; <span class="roman">English Men of Science</span>; a forty-volume translation of Balzac's <span class="italic">Com&eacute;die humaine</span>; as well as multi-volume <span class="roman">Temple</span> editions of Fielding, Scott, Dickens, Hugo, Thackeray, and Hazlitt. There was even a <span class="roman">Temple Bible</span> in thirty-one volumes. Dent's list was not, however, limited to the classics. He also published contemporary writing by Maurice Hewlett, H. G. Wells, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Bernhard Berenson, Edward Thomas, John Masefield, Henry James, Padraic Colum, George Santayana, Mary Webb, and the later works of Joseph Conrad and W. H. Hudson, as well as children's books by Kate Greenaway and Edith Nesbit. The <span class="roman">Temple Primers</span> series popularized academic subjects for lay readers.<br>
<br>In 1906 Dent began his greatest project, a 1000-volume uniform edition of world literature, selling for 1<i>s</i>. a volume. His editor was Ernest Rhys, who proposed the name <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>. Cheap classic reprints were by no means a new concept&#151;Rhys himself had earlier edited the 1<i>s</i>. <span class="roman">Camelot Classics</span> for the Newcastle publisher Walter Scott&#151;but <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> was unprecedented in its breadth, coherence, and beautiful design. Reginald Knowles designed the bindings, endpapers, and title-pages in the manner of William Morris. A hand-lettered title and a distinctive floral ornament were stamped on the spine in gold. The demand for <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> was so great that Dent had to build the Temple Press, a vast new production facility at Letchworth Garden City. In 1911 the firm moved to imposing new offices at 10&#150;13 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London. Having invested so much capital in his Letchworth plant, Dent could be stingy with his workers, authors, and editors. Rhys, for instance, had to work at breakneck speed to prepare new volumes for publication (152 in the first year), and at first earned only 3 guineas per volume. But Dent was a capitalist with an entirely genuine commitment to quality: when one of the first <span class="roman">Everyman</span> volumes, Lamb's <span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span>, fell short of his aesthetic standards, he had the entire print run destroyed.<br>
<br>Dent has been criticized for his over-reverent, conservative, petit bourgeois tastes in literature. (He always pronounced it <i>litterchah</i>, his employee Frank Swinnerton recalled.) Since the early <span class="roman">Everyman</span> volumes were reprints of out-of-copyright texts, they inevitably represented the standard canon of Greek, Roman, English, American, and western European classics. By 1956 the firm's editorial director admitted that many of the Victorian war-horses had already become anachronisms. With puritanical fastidiousness, Dent blocked the admission of Tobias Smollett and <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> to <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>. Yet in other respects the series was remarkably inclusive, embracing the Russian classics, the great books of India, and an impressive range of female novelists. (Dent himself wrote the introduction to Elizabeth Gaskell's <span class="italic">Cranford</span>, one of his personal favourites.) A Liberal nonconformist, Dent was inspired by an almost religious mission to bring culture to the masses. As a member of the Toynbee Hall education committee, he organized a Sunday afternoon concert series that ran in Whitechapel for thirty years. From 1902 he served on the council of the British and Foreign School Society, and he was a strong supporter of Margaret McMillan's nursery school movement.<br>
<br>In 1912 Dent launched <span class="italic">Everyman</span>, a penny literary weekly. It was a failure, partly as a result of quarrels with the editor, Charles Sarolea. The First World War slowed the publication of new <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> volumes to a near standstill, and wartime inflation forced the series to raise its prices and economize on ornamentation. Dent was devastated by the loss of two sons, Paxton and Austen, in the war; significantly, the first work of twentieth-century literature published in <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> was Henri Barbusse's devastating war novel <span class="italic">Le feu</span>, translated as <span class="italic">Under Fire</span>.<br>
<br>J. M. Dent's sons Hugh and Jack Dent and Jack's son, F. J. Martin Dent, all assumed managerial roles in the family firm. J. M. Dent retired in 1924, and died of heart failure at his home, Cromhamleigh, Harewood Road, south Croydon, on 9 May 1926. He was buried in Sanderstead churchyard, Surrey. <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> did not reach volume 1000 until 1956, but Dent had lived to see total sales exceed 20 million.<br>
