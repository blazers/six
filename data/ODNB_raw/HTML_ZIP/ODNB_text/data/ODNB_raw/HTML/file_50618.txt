<span class="headword">Russell,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1374), <span class="occ">abbot of Rushen and bishop of Sodor and Man</span>, was a native Manxman. Russell was for about eighteen years abbot of the Cistercian foundation Rushen Abbey, the premier religious house on the Isle of Man. In 1348 he was elected bishop of Sodor and Man by the clergy of Man in St German's Cathedral, Peel. He cemented his position by gaining papal provision to the diocese of Sodor and Man, and was consecrated at Avignon by Bertrand, cardinal-bishop of Ostia by 6 May 1349.<br>
<br>The writer of the episcopal list, which is appended to the chronicle of the kings of Sodor and Man and the Isles, states, mistakenly, that Russell was consecrated by Pope Clement VI in person and claims, again mistakenly, that all his predecessors had been confirmed and consecrated by the archbishop of Nidaros, Norway (the metropolitan).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, it is impossible to evaluate the power of the Norwegian metropolitan over the diocese of Sodor and Man, because the Norwegian records have been lost. It is notable, however, that although the papal camera informed Arno, archbishop of Nidaros, of the appointment of Russell as bishop of Sodor and Man, Pope Clement VI granted Russell exemption from undertaking the perilous sea voyage to pay obedience to his metropolitan in person.<br>
<br>The diocese of Sodor and Man had suffered badly during the Anglo-Scottish wars. In 1349 Pope Clement VI allowed Russell to encumber himself and the Sodor church with a mortgage of 1200 gold florins, to claim and receive the majority of the goods and debts of his predecessor, Bishop Thomas, and promised a charitable subsidy in support of his diocese. Despite these favours, Russell was late in paying his common and petty services to the apostolic chamber. In 1363 he complained to Pope Urban V that his cathedral church and its precincts had been occupied as a fortress, that the bishops had greatly suffered, and that divine services had ceased. As in 1349, he received papal dispensation to consecrate eight illiterate persons to benefices, because so few literate persons were to be found on account of the wars.<br>
<br>At its fullest extent, the diocese of Sodor and Man included the Outer Hebrides, the Inner Hebrides (excluding Lismore, Kerrera, Seil, Luing, and the Cumbraes), and the Isle of Man. The scant evidence for Russell's episcopate relates mainly to his activities in Man, emphasizing the rift between the Hebrides and Man, which culminated in the division of the diocese between two bishops in 1387.<br>
<br>The synodal statutes attributed to Russell in three inter-related manuscripts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are described as being made on 23 February 1351 by Russell and all the clergy of Man, but no mention is made of the Hebrides. The six chapters relate to keeping order in the parishes and churches, and to the duty of the clergy to expound the Catholic faith to the laity. The statutes stipulate that the laity should be persuaded to learn the apostolic creed in their mother tongue which, in the mid-fourteenth century, was probably Manx Gaelic.<br>
<br>William Russell died on 21 April 1374 at Ramshead in Lancashire and was buried at the monastery of Furness, the mother house of Rushen Abbey.<br>
