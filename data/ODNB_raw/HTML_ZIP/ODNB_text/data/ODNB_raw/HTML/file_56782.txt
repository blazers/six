<span class="headword">Roberts,  Brian Richard</span>  (1906&#150;1988), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born on 16 September 1906 at 28 Queen Elizabeth's Walk, Stoke Newington, London, the eldest of the four sons of Robert Lewis Roberts (1875&#150;1956), sometime president of the London Master Builders' Association, and his wife, Muriel Grace, second daughter of J. T. Henderson of Highbury. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, and at St John's College, Oxford, where he read Greats. On 25 July 1935 Roberts married Elisabeth Franziska Dora (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), elder daughter of Dr Leo Zuntz, of Berlin, and they had one adopted son.<br>
<br>One brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39820/', "Colin Henderson Roberts (1909&#150;1990)")</script>, was a classical scholar and, from 1954 to 1974, secretary to the delegates of Oxford University Press; another, Roger Lewis (1911&#150;1990), became chaplain at the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy and chaplain to the queen from 1969 to 1981. Brian Roberts, after graduating, chose to enter journalism with a lowly job at the <span class="italic">Oxford Mail</span>. In 1933 he moved to Fleet Street to join the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> as a sub-editor, and in 1939 he moved again, to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, with which company he remained. When the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> was founded in 1961 he became its managing editor, and in 1966 he succeeded Donald McLachlan (1908&#150;1971), who had been the paper's first editor.<br>
<br>Roberts was a thoroughly professional journalist, combining deep experience with mental quickness and flair. His organizing abilities played a vital part in the creation of the new Sunday newspaper. Although small in stature and physically somewhat frail, he possessed a natural authority which was reinforced by an often wintry wit. His rages were legendary but they were swiftly forgotten (by him at least) and he was also capable of great kindness. He was not primarily a &#145;writing editor&#146;, nor did he spend much time cultivating cabinet ministers and suchlike persons: essentially he was a &#145;backroom&#146; newspaperman, devoting his talent and energy to the production of a newspaper which came up to his standards of honesty and accuracy.<br>
<br>By a bizarre turn of events this least publicity-seeking of editors found himself the object of national attention in 1971, when he became the central figure in a celebrated <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> trial at the Old Bailey. He did not relish the experience: it had not been funny, he wrote after his acquittal, to sit for nearly a month in the dock on a kitchen chair once occupied by one of the Kray brothers. But he endured it with fortitude.<br>
<br>The case arose from the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>'s reporting of the Nigerian civil war. Roberts, whose editorial line had been in support of the minority Biafran cause, published the text of a report marked &#145;confidential&#146; from the United Kingdom high commission in Lagos, a document which was severely critical of the federal Nigerian army. The news value of this scoop, at first considerable, was diminished by the speedy collapse of Biafran resistance; nevertheless special branch officers arrived at the newspaper's offices to investigate the &#145;leak&#146;, and prosecutions under section 2 of the 1911 <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> duly followed.<br>
<br>In addition to Roberts and the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, the defendants were Colonel Douglas Cairns, former military attach&eacute; at Lagos, who had sent a copy of the report to his former chief, General Henry Alexander; and Jonathan Aitken (at that time a freelance journalist, later a Conservative MP) who, after being shown the report by General Alexander, had communicated it to the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>.<br>
<br>From the outset it was accepted that no question of national security was involved. The important point, therefore, was the extent to which this &#145;catch-all&#146; section of the act could be used to restrict the publication of matter which, while possibly embarrassing to the government of the day, in no way affected national security (covered by section 1). In a historic summing-up Mr Justice Caulfield (1914&#150;1994) declared that section 2 had &#145;reached retirement age and should be pensioned off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 4 Feb 1971). The jury swiftly acquitted all defendants and the judge awarded them their costs out of public funds.<br>
<br>During the summing-up Lord Goodman, representing Aitken, passed a note to the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span>'s then proprietor, Lord Hartwell, saying: &#145;I think your man is going to be given a medal. A. G.&#146;  (Hartwell). The note stood on Roberts's desk thereafter: and indeed the Institute of Journalists, to mark a notable victory, later awarded Roberts its gold medal.<br>
<br>After the trial Roberts wrote: &#145;I believe I am the first editor to be prosecuted under a stupid, obscure and malignant Act. God willing, I shall prove to have been the last&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, 7 Feb 1971). He campaigned against the oppressive section 2, and there followed the appointment of a committee under Lord Franks, provost of Worcester College, Oxford, to examine the question. In its report in 1972 this committee recommended the repeal and replacement of section 2, to Roberts's great satisfaction.<br>
<br>Roberts retired in 1976. He had interests apart from journalism. At Old Foxhunt Manor, Waldron, Heathfield, Sussex, he was his own active farm manager. Following family tradition, he was for many years a member of the governing body of the Northern Polytechnic, London, which his grandfather had helped to found, and in 1956 he succeeded his father as its chairman. His term of office coincided with a turbulent period of student unrest. In 1975 he was made an honorary fellow of his old college, St John's, of which his brother Colin had been a fellow since 1934. In 1981 he became an honorary fellow of the Northern Polytechnic. He died on 2 June 1988 at his home, Old Foxhunt Manor, and was survived by his wife and son.<br>
