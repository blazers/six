<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward</span>  (1779&#150;1849), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, second son and seventh child of Sir John Thomas Stanley, sixth baronet, of Alderley Park, Cheshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Hugh Owen of Penrhos, Anglesey, was born in London on 1 January 1779. His elder brother, John Thomas, was first Baron Stanley of Alderley, and father of Edward John Stanley, second Baron Stanley of Alderley. Edward's natural inclination was for the sea, but he was not allowed to enter the navy. Educated partly at private schools, partly by tutors, he was sent in 1798 to St John's College, Cambridge, knowing nothing of Greek, almost equally ignorant of Latin, and possessing only a smattering of mathematics. Hard work to some extent remedied these deficiencies. In 1802 his name appears in the mathematical tripos as sixteenth wrangler.<br>
<br>Ordained in 1805, Stanley was briefly curate of Windlesham in Surrey. In that year he was presented by his father to the family living of Alderley, Cheshire, where he remained for thirty-two years. In 1810 he married Catherine (1792&#150;1862), daughter of the Revd Oswald Leycester, rector of Stoke upon Tern; among their children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26259/', "Arthur Penrhyn Stanley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41304/', "Mary Stanley")</script>.<br>
<br>An excellent parish priest at a time when the standard of parochial duty was low, Stanley devoted himself earnestly to his work. He was keenly interested in education, introducing into his schools gymnastic exercises, and subjects such as elementary botany, English history, and geography. Infant schools, temperance societies, mechanics' institutes, and statistical societies found in him a zealous patron. He was also instrumental in founding a clerical society among the neighbouring clergy. A natural aptitude for science, and a conviction of its intimate connection with religion, made him a student of ornithology, entomology, mineralogy, and geology. His ornithological observations were embodied in his <span class="italic">Familiar History of Birds, their Nature, Habits, and Instincts</span> (2 vols., 1836) and his nickname was &#145;Jim Crow&#146;. He was one of the first clergymen to lecture on the then suspect science of geology. A whig in politics, and by nature a reformer, he took up a position on questions of the day which was rare in his profession. His pamphlets, published in 1829 and 1836, attempted to allay the animosities between Roman Catholics and protestants. In 1831, in the midst of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> agitation, he promoted a petition for church reform. When the new and unpopular poor law came into operation in 1834, he offered his services as chairman of the board of guardians called on to administer the act in his union.<br>
<br>Stanley was unsuccessfully sounded out by Lord Melbourne about becoming bishop of Manchester (the new see then being planned) but in 1837 he accepted the offer of the bishopric of Norwich, a notoriously lax and corrupt diocese. In the same year he became clerk of the Chapel Royal and in 1840 a fellow of the Royal Society. By vigorous enforcement of the <span class="roman">Plurality and Non-residence Act</span>, he added during his episcopate 173 parsonage-houses. During the same period he increased the number of Sunday services by 347. He doubled the number of schools and reformed the preparation of candidates for ordination, becoming personally acquainted with the previous career of every candidate. At great personal expense he prosecuted and removed those clergymen whose lives had brought them within the reach of the law. By the appointment of seventy rural deans, each of whom was every year entertained at the palace, he made himself acquainted with what passed in every part of his diocese. Instead of holding septennial confirmations at a few large centres, he confirmed annually at convenient stations. He assisted all the charitable institutions of the county, especially those in Norwich, interested himself in the working of the poor laws, and personally inspected the efficiency of the local schools. In the House of Lords he was a regular attendant and a staunch supporter of whig principles. His most telling speeches were delivered in defence of the government scheme of education in 1839, on behalf of relaxing the stringent terms of clerical subscription in 1840, and on the endowment of Maynooth in 1842. He took part, with especial pleasure, in such movements as <span class="roman">Bible</span> societies, city missions, and British and foreign schools, which brought together on neutral ground churchmen and nonconformists. The same feeling led him to support in the National Society in 1839 such changes as would open the doors of schools to the children of nonconformists. He was also the first bishop who interested himself in the movement for ragged schools. Always an eager advocate of temperance, he appeared on the platform with Father Theobald Mathew, who in 1843 was his guest at Norwich.<br>
<br>Stanley's liberal views, fearlessness of criticism, and vigorous reforms at first created ill feeling in the diocese. Before the close of his episcopate, however, he not only changed the whole atmosphere of religious life throughout his see, but won the affectionate esteem of all classes, lay and clerical. In August 1849 he started for a tour in Scotland with his wife and daughters. At Brahan Castle in Ross-shire he was taken ill and, after a few days, died from congestion of the brain on 6 September 1849. On 21 September he was buried in the nave of Norwich Cathedral.<br>
