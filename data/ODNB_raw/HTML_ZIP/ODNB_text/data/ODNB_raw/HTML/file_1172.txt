<span class="headword">Baldwin <span class="st"> [Bawden]</span>,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Octaviano Fuscincelli]</span>  (1562&#150;1632), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 10 November 1562 in Cornwall, perhaps near Bodmin, birthplace of John Cornelius, with whom, according to Henry More SJ, Baldwin made his rudimentary studies. He entered Exeter College, Oxford, on 20 December 1577. Presumably he was reconciled to the Roman church some time in 1582 before his departure for the English College in Rheims, where he arrived on 31 December 1582. He was sent to Rome on 13 August 1583. Richard Barret, prefect of studies in Rheims, held Baldwin in high esteem, describing him as &#145;most obedient&#146; and as a &#145;disciple of Cornelius&#146; in a letter to Alfonso Agazzari, rector of the English College, Rome, on 11 August 1583  (<span class="italic">Diaries of the English College</span>, 331). Baldwin enrolled at the English College on 1 October. He was ordained in Rome on 16 April 1588 and entered the Society of Jesus there on 2 February 1590. He remained in Rome as English confessor at St Peter's for a year after his noviceship. On 12 January 1593 he was sent to the Spanish Netherlands, where he lectured on theology in Louvain for a year.<br>
<br>Summoned to Spain by Robert Parsons in late 1594, Baldwin, disguised as a Neapolitan merchant, Octaviano Fuscincelli, escorted six boys to the English College in Seville. The boys did not know that the merchant, who consistently spoke Latin and Italian, was an English Jesuit. Their vessel was intercepted at Calais by an English man-of-war. Taken to England, the boys were entrusted to John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, and Baldwin was gaoled in Bridewell. He got word to Henry Garnet, the Jesuit superior, but the speed with which Catholics sought to ransom Baldwin aroused suspicions. To quell them he suggested that officials ask John Gerard if he knew a merchant named Fuscincelli. Since that was Baldwin's official Jesuit alias, Gerard recognized it and replied yes. Cleared of suspicion Baldwin was ransomed in exchange for an English prisoner named Hawkins. He remained in England, living with Richard Cotton at Warblington, Hampshire, until late 1595, when he went to Rome to serve as minister of the English College under Father Rector Muzio Vitelleschi, future general of the society. In April of 1598 he was sent to Brussels as William Holt's successor as vice-prefect of the English mission, supervising English affairs at the court of Isabella and Albert in Brussels and relaying communications between Rome and England, a position he held until 1610. In Antwerp on 10 February 1602 he was professed of the four vows.<br>
<br>In 1605 Sir Thomas Edmonds, English ambassador, demanded that Baldwin, proclaimed a traitor because of alleged conspiracies with Ambrogio Spinola, commander of Spanish forces in Flanders for an invasion of England at the time of the Gunpowder Plot, be returned to England for trial. Archduke Albert refused. Recognized by letters he carried, despite his disguise, Baldwin was apprehended near Speyer in 1610 by soldiers of the elector palatine. Chained and imprisoned he was eventually turned over to Edward Cecil, brother of Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, who treated him with respect and kindness. By November he was in the Tower of London. King James replied to the archduke's demand for Baldwin's immediate release by promising that he would be free to return to the Spanish Netherlands once his innocence of any involvement in the Gunpowder Plot was established. But no legal proceedings were initiated and he remained in the Tower until 15 June 1618 when he and eleven other Jesuits were banished from the realm through the intercession of the count of Gondomar, Spanish ambassador. His stay in Brussels was brief: he hastened to Rome to explain and defend the unique status of the beleaguered English mission to Vitelleschi, now father-general. On 16 January 1619 he left Rome for Spain where he visited the English colleges on his journey back to Flanders. On 22 January 1621 he was named rector of the English College in Louvain and in early 1622 was transferred to the English College in St Omer. On 12 November 1622 he became, with the support and approval of the Infanta Isabella, the first Englishman to be rector of the college. He died at St Omer on 28 September 1632.<br>
