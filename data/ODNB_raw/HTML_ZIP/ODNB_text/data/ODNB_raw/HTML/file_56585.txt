<span class="headword">Cranston,  Robert</span>  (1815&#150;1892), <span class="occ">founder of temperance hotels</span>, was born on 9 August 1815, at East Calder, near Edinburgh, the son of James Cranston, mason and innkeeper, and his wife, Janet Garvie. His grandfather Robert had moved there from Jedburgh about 1778 to act as factor for the earl of Buchan. Robert's parents kept the Bay Horse inn in East Calder before moving into Edinburgh in 1822.<br>
<br>Cranston was educated in Edinburgh and then apprenticed at the university printing office. After losing his left leg, however, following an act of bravado at the age of sixteen, he moved to a more sedentary apprenticeship with a tailor at 43 Princes Street (later the site of Cranston's first hotel). This proved a valuable extension to his education&#151;he was often chosen to read aloud to his fellow workers, and it was here that he developed his fondness for the novels of Sir Walter Scott. There was also much lively discussion of current affairs. It was following arguments about the newly prominent temperance issue that Cranston and two friends embarked on a trial dry period of three months, after which they assessed themselves as better off without drink, and became total abstainers.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1838 Cranston married Elizabeth (1813&#150;1873), the eldest daughter of John Dalgliesh, carter in Leith; they set up house at South Bridge where Cranston was partner in a tailor's shop. In 1843, however, following the lead of his friend John Aitken who had opened Edinburgh's first teetotal coffee house in 1837, he abandoned tailoring to establish a temperance coffee house and lodgings at 129 High Street. Well supplied with newspapers, and commended too by Elizabeth's excellent pies, this was a success, and soon became a particular meeting place for Chartists. Cranston himself was actively involved in this movement for political reform, editing its paper the <span class="italic">North British Express</span> for some time, and was twice briefly arrested.<br>
<br>Five years later in 1848 the Cranstons sold the coffee house and opened the Waverley Temperance Hotel at 43 Princes Street. Many thought its prime site and high-quality fittings commercial madness, but the Cranstons had shrewdly spotted a gap in the market. While the temperance rule was strictly enforced, the hotel aimed for the first class and was immediately successful. The roll of its notable visitors was proudly kept. Temperance hotels spread rapidly from these beginnings, especially in Scotland, in the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Despite heavy financial loss in the crash of the Royal Bank of London in 1849, Cranston recovered fast enough to exploit the opportunities presented by the Great Exhibition in 1851: he opened a Waverley in London at 37 King Street, Cheapside, and co-operated with Thomas Cook, another temperance man, to cater for his excursions to London. The next expansion was into Glasgow with the Waverley at 185 Buchanan Street in 1860. In 1868 the New Waverley was opened in Waterloo Place, Edinburgh, after which what became known as the Old Waverley on Princes Street was enlarged, and finally reconstructed in 1884. The scale of charges was the same in each hotel.<br>
<br>The success of the hotels, which made Cranston wealthy and supported his political activity, was mainly due to the skills of Elizabeth Cranston, remembered in the family biography as &#145;a large-hearted woman, remarkably able and phenomenally rapid and accurate with figures&#146;  (Mein, 3). Elizabeth died in 1873. On 23 April 1877 Cranston married Mary Ann, daughter of James Ryan of Gullane; she also predeceased him, dying in 1890.<br>
<br>Cranston was himself always ready to acknowledge the capacities of the women of his family. He was an early supporter of women's suffrage and spent freely on the education of his two daughters, Mary (1846&#150;1932) and Elizabeth 
    (&#145;Liebe&#146;; 1848&#150;1941)
  , as well as on that of his two sons, Robert (1843&#150;1923), later Sir Robert, lord provost of Edinburgh, and John Dalgliesh (1845&#150;1916). He recognized Mary's business talents by giving her the Washington Temperance Hotel on Sauchiehall Street on her marriage to the Glasgow photographic dealer George Mason in 1872, and naming her in his will chief trustee, with his oldest son, of the Waverley empire. He also financed the business start-up of his cousin's daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56587/', "Catherine (Kate) Cranston")</script>, whose Glasgow tearooms were renowned.<br>
<br>Cranston brought his progressive views to bear on local politics, serving from 1868 to 1890 on Edinburgh's town council, interesting himself particularly in the reform of the fire brigade, and in efforts to provide public baths and wash-houses and improve housing. He became a burgess of Edinburgh and a freeman of London. His passion for improving was exercised on his home, Waverley Park, Abbeyhill, and he also put up model dwelling houses. He was a vigorous, charitable, and genial man, but stern enough if his wishes were crossed. From his long service on the bench, from 1875 to 1887 and again in 1889&#150;90, he became widely known as Bailie Cranston. He was much respected for his integrity and intellectual clarity, and it was his boast on retirement that none of his judgments had ever been appealed. Cranston was several times pressed to stand for the provostship, and for parliament, but declined partly because of his inability to kneel on ceremonial occasions.<br>
<br>Cranston died at his home, Waverley Park, 18 Spring Gardens, Abbeyhill, Edinburgh, on 11 May 1892 as a result of pneumonia and cardiac failure. Accorded a public funeral, he was buried at Grange cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
