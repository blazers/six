<span class="headword">Farleigh,  Frederick William Charles <span class="st"> [John]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1965), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and painter</span>, was born on 16 June 1900 at 104 Carlton Street, St Pancras, London. He was the son of Frederick William Farleigh, billiard marker, and his wife, Mary Ann Bleach. He was brought up in London and attended St Mary Abbots School in Kensington. The fields around Kensington and the streets of the City formed the background to his early years and he expressed a genuine and undying affection for London throughout his life.<br>
<br>Farleigh became an articled apprentice at the Artists Illustrators Agency in Balham, London, in 1914 and began to take evening classes in drawing at the Bolt Court School. In June 1918 he was called up for service in the army and served until the armistice in November. In 1919 he completed his apprenticeship and obtained a government grant which enabled him to study full time for three years at the London County Council Central School of Arts and Crafts, where he was taught by Bernard Meninsky and introduced to wood-engraving by the influential head of book production, Noel Rooke. After a period as an assistant art teacher at Rugby School (1922&#150;5) Farleigh returned to take a part-time post teaching antique and still-life drawing at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. He married Elsie Ida Evelyn Wooden (1900&#150;1981) at the register office, Kensington, on 13 November 1925. She had also been a student at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Their only child, Mary, was born in 1927.<br>
<br>As well as producing murals, paintings, and drawings, Farleigh received commissions for designs from the Postal Congress Union (1929), London Transport (between 1933 and 1963), and Poole Potteries (1934) among many others. He also began to produce wood-engravings about 1921 and in 1925 was elected a member of the Society of Wood Engravers. In that same year he received his first commission for wood-engraved designs when the Golden Cockerel Press chose him to illustrate an edition of the <span class="italic">Essays of Swift</span>. For the next thirty-three years he was commissioned by most of the influential private presses and commercial book publishers of the period and illustrated twenty-eight books with wood-engravings. He achieved wide acclaim and recognition for his illustrations to <span class="italic">The Adventures of the Black Girl in her Search for God</span>, written by George Bernard Shaw and published by Constable in 1932. Shaw commissioned Farleigh after requesting a trial drawing and was closely involved in the designs. Farleigh duly acknowledged Shaw's input in his partly autobiographical work <span class="italic">Graven Image</span> (1940) where he gave a detailed account of the progress of the book. Shaw's witty, satirical text, and Farleigh's quasi-erotic depictions of the African girl, &#145;a fine creature, whose satin skin and shining muscles made the missionary folk seem like ashen ghosts&#146;  (Shaw, <span class="italic">The Black Girl</span>, 1932, 8), guaranteed its success. The first edition of 25,000 copies, priced inexpensively at 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., was sold immediately. This was the first mass-produced book of the period to contain wood-engravings and it was effective in popularizing the medium for commercial book illustration as well as for the private presses.<br>
<br>Farleigh's independent prints form a lasting personal contribution to the art of wood-engraving. They demonstrate technical virtuosity and intellectual content and place him alongside other important artists of the period who developed the medium as an art form. He produced several large images, many of mythological content such as <span class="italic">Lilith</span> (1937), which demonstrated that wood-engraving was not just limited to the small scale. He was appointed head of book production at the Central School on the retirement of Noel Rooke in 1947 and, as a teacher, played an influential role in encouraging and inspiring a new generation of wood-engravers. In the introduction to the monograph on John Farleigh, written by his former student Monica Poole, his teaching is described as full of vitality and enthusiasm and the man himself as forthright, with a great sense of humour but a deeply serious mind  (Poole, 5&#150;17).<br>
<br>Farleigh exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy summer exhibitions from 1937 until 1964, and had several solo exhibitions at the Leicester Galleries and Lef&egrave;vre Gallery between 1938 and 1946. In 1948 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. Farleigh wrote a further five books on crafts and craftsmen between 1945 and 1959 which were also a vehicle for his theories on the teaching of art and design and were illustrated with his own and his students' work. In his <span class="italic">It Never Dies</span> (1946), Farleigh included some moving passages from his wartime diaries, written when he carried out duties as an air-raid warden. In 1940 he had been appointed chairman of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society and his ambition was to open a permanent exhibition centre in London for designer craftsmen. In 1946 the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society banded together with four other arts and crafts organizations to form the Crafts Centre of Great Britain. The Craft Centre's gallery opened at Hay Hill, Mayfair, in 1947. Farleigh was appointed CBE in 1949 for his work in founding this organization and in 1950 he took over the chairmanship, resigning only in 1964. During this period he promoted and campaigned for the crafts in Britain with his articles, lectures, and broadcasts. The death of Farleigh's daughter in 1954, at the age of twenty-seven, had a devastating effect on his life. His wife's health suffered and he became seriously ill in 1960. He died on 30 March 1965 of pneumonia and leukaemia at Hampstead General Hospital, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 5 April.<br>
