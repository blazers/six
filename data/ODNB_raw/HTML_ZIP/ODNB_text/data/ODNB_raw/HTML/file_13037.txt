<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Frank Forester]</span>  (1807&#150;1858), <span class="occ">sportsman and writer</span>, was born on 7 April 1807 at 10 Poland Street, London, the eldest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13063/', "Revd William Herbert (1778&#150;1847)")</script>, dean of Manchester, and the Hon. Letitia Emily Dorothea, daughter of Joshua, fifth Viscount Allen. He was educated privately until 1819 and afterwards at a school in Rottingdean kept by the Revd Dr Hooker, and at Eton College from 1820 to 1825. It is likely that he was destined for a career in holy orders, and in 1830 he graduated BA from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where, as a bon viveur and member of the Cambridge yeomanry cavalry, he early showed a taste for dissipation, scholarship, outdoor sports, and writing. Upon graduation, prompted perhaps by personal and financial indiscretions, he fled somewhat suddenly to France and, in 1831, to New York. None of his biographers satisfactorily explains the reasons for self-exile, but his family refused thereafter to acknowledge his existence.<br>
<br>Having abandoned plans to settle in Canada, Herbert accepted employment in New York as a classics master at the Revd R. Townsend Huddart's Classical Institute. He remained there for eight years, during which his engagingly eccentric manner and outlandish dress brought him a social cachet among sportsmen, literary men, and educated merchant leaders. Since boyhood an ardent participant in country pursuits, nevertheless as a classical scholar he had few equals in North America, and his translations from Greek, Roman, and French originals received high praise. To his extensive knowledge of English history and literature he added a marked ability as a pen-and-ink artist. Finding his British citizenship was a barrier to a legal career, he was to become one of the first professional writers in the United States. The extent of his writings is revealed in William Van Winkle's <span class="italic">Bibliography</span> (1936), covering 1832&#150;58, supplemented by Stephen Meats in <span class="italic">Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</span> (67, 1973, 69&#150;73). Herbert's North American literary d&eacute;but coincided with a burgeoning mass-market magazine industry and initially he co-edited with James G. Bennett the <span class="italic">Courier and Inquirer</span>.<br>
<br>Stung by rebuffs from the <span class="italic">Knickerbocker Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Parlour Journal</span>, Herbert began publication in 1833 with A. D. Patterson of the <span class="italic">American Monthly Magazine</span>, whose prospectus promised poetry, biography, theatre reviews, and travel. In the belief that literature influenced public morality and mass education, symbolically the first issue began with an introduction on the value of periodical literature. In pursuit of this ideal, practical economic matters were ignored and with Patterson's resignation in 1834 the magazine collapsed in early 1835. Having become a truculent fop and roadhouse brawler by the mid-1830s, the floridly moustachioed author achieved modest recognition in leading contemporary periodicals, and some of his fugitive poetry was well received by Edgar Allan Poe. The same luminary, however, mightily trashed much of Herbert's other works. An attempt to edit <span class="italic">The Era</span>, the first American Sunday family-oriented journal, fell foul of both sabbath inhibitions and unauthorized reproduction of its contents by regional newspapers. The launch of a sports magazine also collapsed but the momentum this generated helped to identify Herbert &#145;as an important figure in the prehistory of general circulation sports magazines in the United States&#146;  (Riley, 182).<br>
<br>Before a break-up with Charles Fenno Hoffman, co-editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly</span>, whom he suspected of political leanings, Herbert's first serial novel, <span class="italic">The Brothers: a Tale of the Fronde</span>, appeared anonymously in 1834 along with a series of sporting sketches for the <span class="italic">Spirit of the Times</span>. Of his several romances, <span class="italic">Marmaduke Wyvil</span> (1843) was foremost in popularity. The others were carefully written but prolix and unimaginative, more akin to historical recitals than romances. Although he retained his real name for the series of sentimental romances which he hoped would establish a &#145;literary&#146; reputation, a readership beneath his perceived dignity prompted him to adopt the pseudonym Frank Forester, under which between 1839 and 1841 he wrote humorous sporting and wildlife articles for the <span class="italic">American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine</span>. These were later collected as <span class="italic">The Warwick Woodlands</span> (1845; rev. edn, 1851). Other works, on closely related themes in a sub-Surtees vein, were <span class="italic">My Shooting Box</span> and <span class="italic">The Deerstalkers</span> (1849) for <span class="italic">Graham's American Monthly Magazine</span> (1846). With <span class="italic">Field Sports in the United States</span> (1849), coupled with burlesque wearing of hunting attire, he took on the role of the father of American sporting and hunting literature.<br>
<br>The publication in three volumes of <span class="italic">Frank Forester and his Friends, or, Woodland Adventures in the Middle States of North America</span> by Richard Bentley in London (1849), featuring amusing characterization and vulgar dialect, prepared an overseas readership for similar genial treatment of British hunting scenes as depicted in <span class="italic">The Quorndon Hounds, or, A Virginian at Melton Mowbray</span> (1852). A thread of poetic imagination runs through Herbert's rural literature, enhanced and enlivened by his drawings. The twin volumes of <span class="italic">Frank Forester's Fish and Fishing in the United States and British Provinces of North America</span> (1849&#150;50) and the similarly titled <span class="italic">Horse and Horsemanship</span> (1857) head his non-humour category and are authoritative works to which devotees still turn. In later years he turned to purely historical writings such as <span class="italic">The Captains of the Roman Republic</span> (1854), but his most profitable literary work was the translation of Eug&egrave;ne Sue and several of Alexandre Dumas's shorter novels.<br>
<br>Buffeted by implacable and possibly dishonest creditors, Herbert relinquished his chosen &#145;image&#146; of cavalier boots, spurs, and Scottish plaid shawl and preferred a semi-reclusive literary retreat at The Cedars on the Passaic River outside Newark, New Jersey. On 31 December 1839 he married Sarah, daughter of John Barker, mayor of Bangor, Maine, whom he met on a hunting excursion. She died in 1844, leaving a son, William George, who later went to England and stayed there. The failure of his second marriage in February 1858 to Adela R. Budlong of Providence, Rhode Island (the divorced wife of an actor), after only a few weeks' duration caused the emotionally mercurial and heart-broken author on 17 May 1858 to shoot himself in the Stevens House Hotel on Broadway, New York. He was buried in Mount Pleasant cemetery, Newark, where eighteen years later the Newark Herbert Association erected a simple gravestone bearing the word &#145;Infelicissimus&#146;. In 1920 a memorial to him by the sportsmen of America was unveiled at Warwick, Orange county, New York, the background scenario to much of his most colourful and affectionate work.<br>
