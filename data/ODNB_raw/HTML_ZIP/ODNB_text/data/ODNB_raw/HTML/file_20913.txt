<span class="headword">O'Sullivan Beare,  Philip</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1590, <em>d.</em> in or after 1634), <span class="occ">historian and writer</span>, was one of the seventeen children of Dermot O'Sullivan and his wife, Johanna MacSwiney. Born on Valentia Island off the Kerry coast in south-western Ireland, he belonged to the family that owned much of the remote peninsula. However, the O'Sullivans, headed by the O'Sullivan Beare, were under pressure from an English regime keen to advance alien systems of land tenure, inheritance, and agriculture, and from new planters established in the region. The Nine Years' War, ending in 1603, brought the defeat of the O'Sullivans and their allies. Many of those not killed in the warfare moved to continental Europe. Among the refugees were Philip O'Sullivan Beare, his parents, some of his siblings, and his kinsman O'Sullivan Beare. The young O'Sullivan arrived in Corunna in northern Spain in 1602, and immediately received the protection of the local governor, Carazena. Educated at Santiago de Compostela, he joined kinsmen who opposed the Jesuits' annexation of the college in 1613. Unlike others in the institution, he was not destined for the priesthood, and soon secured commissions in the army and then the navy. However, this service was not congenial to a young man with scholarly and polemical inclinations. A bellicosity, which would later animate his writings, also marked his behaviour. At Madrid in 1618, he engaged in a sword fight with another fugitive from Ireland, Sir John Bathe, suspected as a spy sent to report on the schemes of the refugee community in Spain. In the ensuing m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, Bathe killed the O'Sullivan Beare, whom Philip III of Spain had ennobled as conde de Birhaven.<br>
<br>Philip O'Sullivan took sanctuary in the house of the French ambassador, but suffered no penalties. Thereafter his movements are obscure. The suggestion that he eventually returned to Ireland, to the Franciscan house of Kilcrea in co. Cork, is unsupported by any evidence. Nor is it known when he died. The last clear indication of his being alive is in 1634.<br>
<br>O'Sullivan's writings reveal something of the attitudes of the dispossessed Irish Catholics who had been forced to move to continental Europe. They were intended to secure diplomatic and military backing from the Habsburgs for the Irish Catholic cause. In addition, they were informed by Spanish historical fashions, emphasizing a Manichaean struggle between heretics and the faithful. In 1621 he published at Lisbon <span class="italic">Historiae catholicae Iberniae compendium</span>. This was a voluminous account of the tribulations of his own people, culminating in a detailed narrative of the campaigns and defeats in Munster in the 1580s and 1590s. Drawing on his intimate local knowledge and the recollections of his family, and written from the perspective of the defeated, it is a valuable corrective to the histories of the victors. In common with his later compositions, it extols Gaelic Ireland and seeks to rebut the contumely heaped on it by both the Old and New English conquerors. O'Sullivan was influenced by his mentor, Father Patrick Synott, and by two Jesuit historians, Michael Cantwell and Richard Conway. O'Sullivan's <span class="italic">Historiae</span>, first published during his life, was&#151;in part&#151;translated and republished in 1903. In addition, he drew on local traditions, mostly in the Irish language, to write saints' lives. That of St Mochna was included in Colgan's <span class="italic">Acta</span>. Others were criticized by fellow clerics for their tone and inaccuracies. More substantial and with longer lasting impact was a life of St Patrick, <span class="italic">Patritiana decas</span>, published in Madrid in 1629. This contributed to the contested process by which Patrick was promoted by Catholics and protestants alike as the national saint of Ireland.<br>
<br>As an exile, embittered by the loss of hereditary possessions, O'Sullivan inveighed against the apologists of and collaborators with the English and protestant order in Ireland. In his <span class="italic">Zoilomastix</span> he sought to refute the calumnies against the Irish of both Giraldus Cambrensis and (more recently) of Stanihurst. His defence included much incidental detail of indigenous habits as well as attacks on those of the interloping English. Known only in manuscript in the seventeenth century, <span class="italic">Zoilomastix</span> was judged by O'Sullivan's co-religionists to have been marred by its rhetorical extravagances. He also contributed through his &#145;Tenebriomastix&#146; to the controversy associated with Thomas Dempster as to whether Ireland or Scotland was to be identified with Scotia. In &#145;Archicornigeromastix&#146; he took on James Ussher, a foremost champion of protestantism in Ireland. O'Sullivan's offering suffered from the disadvantage that in Spain, where he was writing, Ussher's publications were banned and so known only by (hostile) report. However, O'Sullivan's compositions, despite their shortcomings, show how victims of the violent upheavals of the sixteenth century could construct a sympathetic record of what they had endured.<br>
