<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Sagar Jones</span>  (1866&#150;1952), <span class="occ">film-maker</span>, was born at 15 Smithies Street, Blackburn, Lancashire, on 28 October 1866, the son of John Mitchell, an outdoor labourer, and his wife, Jane Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. He was educated at Sherwood's Academy, Duke's Brow, Blackburn, during which time his parents owned the Alliance Temperance Hotel on Northgate. In 1887 he founded a photographic business with his father and by 1894 Sagar and John Mitchell, importers and manufacturers of optical and photographic apparatus, had moved from 17 to 40 Northgate. On 14 August 1894 in Ulverston he married his first wife, Mary Bragg (1868/9&#150;1894), the daughter of Harry Bragg, a railway inspector, but was widowed a few months after the wedding. He was married again, at St Paul's Church, Blackburn, on 13 October 1904, to Ann Eliza Mercer, a widow with one son.<br>
<br>In 1897 Mitchell went into partnership with <a name="cosubject_94370"></a><span class="headword">James Kenyon</span>  (1850&#150;1925), <span class="occ">film-maker</span>, who was born at 21 William Henry Street, Blackburn, Lancashire, on 26 May 1850, the second son of Thomas Kenyon, a cotton weaver from Bolton-by-Bowland, who later became a hairdresser, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heaton. After an elementary education in Blackburn he became a shop worker. At the time of his marriage, on 25 July 1872, to Elizabeth (1850/51&#150;1931), the daughter of James Fell, general agent, Kenyon's occupation was recorded as general labourer. They had one daughter, Gertrude. By 1878 Kenyon was listed in the local trade directory as a fancy goods dealer living at 1 Clifton Street. In 1880 he and his wife inherited her uncle's furniture dealing and cabinet-making business based at 21 King Street, then acquired further premises at 22 Clayton Street. Subsequently he operated a penny-in-the-slot-machine manufacturing company, with strong links to the fairground and exhibition community. These proved important for his film-making venture with the photographic apparatus manufacturer Mitchell. Their differing but overlapping businesses provided the skills and contacts required to make their new company a success.<br>
<br>Mitchell and Kenyon established a regional film company operating in the north of England. Sagar Mitchell later recalled that their first film-showing took place above their premises at 40 Northgate in Blackburn and was reported on 27 November 1897. In September 1899 they reached national prominence when they released three fiction films under their trade name of Norden. By the early 1900s they were one of the largest companies in the United Kingdom producing a mixture of fiction and non-fiction. Their surviving film reconstructions of events from the South African War and the Boxer uprising in China include <span class="italic">A Sneaky Boer</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Attack on a China Mission</span> (1900), filmed on the Yellow Hills in Blackburn. However, Mitchell and Kenyon's main output was films of local events, customs, and people, which they produced for travelling cinema shows. Filming at variable speeds on their Prestwich 4 camera, Mitchell and Kenyon hired a number of camera operators to satisfy their growing clientele for specially commissioned subjects.<br>
<br>Mitchell and Kenyon's first association with the cinematograph exhibitors was in April 1899, when a local showman, George Green, commissioned them to film workers leaving factories in Blackburn to be shown at the Easter fair. By 1901 the firm was selling a variety of specially commissioned local subjects to more than fifty different travelling cinematograph companies. Their geographical range covered the north-east of England, Glasgow and Dundee in Scotland, Cork, Dublin, and Belfast in Ireland, Rhyl and Bangor in north Wales, Nottingham, Birmingham, and Coventry in the midlands, and Bristol and Portsmouth in the south, with the largest percentage of titles relating to Lancashire and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>As well as scenes of workers leaving factory gates, Mitchell and Kenyon covered schools, transport, sporting events, and public entertainment and leisure. Such local pageants as the Leeds lifeboat procession, the Whit day walks in Lancashire, May day processions in Knutsford, and other calendar customs like well-dressing were popular features. Founder members of the Association Football League and the Northern Union League were captured on Mitchell and Kenyon's films. Preston North End, Blackburn Rovers, and Aston Villa regularly appeared, as did newly formed teams like Bradford City and Manchester United, and now defunct clubs such as Gainsborough Trinity. Visits by prominent figures were also recorded. South African War generals including Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, who visited Liverpool on 11 October 1901, and General Buller, who went to Manchester on 23 May 1901, were filmed and then exhibited in the same evening. Films of Baden Powell opening the Drill Hall in Accrington on 3 March 1901 and Joseph Chamberlain at home in Birmingham in September 1902 also survive.<br>
<br>The films were commissioned, purchased, or sent to Mitchell and Kenyon to be developed and printed and shown by the exhibitors in temporary venues in the locality, including music halls, fairground cinematograph shows, and town halls. The income generated must have been considerable because in September 1901 Mitchell and Kenyon, who had until this point continued to occupy their respective premises on Northgate and King Street, moved to premises at the rear of Kenyon's property at 22 Clayton Street, where they installed a laboratory and studio for the production of the fiction titles. Sixty-five fiction titles are now preserved in the Cinema Museum in London, including <span class="italic">Diving Lucy</span> (1903), a comedy which was billed in the United States as the &#145;biggest English comedy hit of the year&#146;. In 1904 the trade press referred to them as one of the leading film manufacturers in the country alongside such contemporaries as Robert Paul, Charles Urban, and the Warwick Trading Company.<br>
<br>Despite their innovations in producing fiction titles Mitchell and Kenyon remained constant to their successful original formula of non-fiction local films. They continued to act on commission for the travelling exhibition circuit and went to Glasgow in 1906, and filmed in locations as far apart as Gainsborough, Llandudno, and Halifax in 1908. However, about this time there appears to have been a gradual drop in activity. Mitchell and Kenyon continued to make films together until 1913, but not outside Lancashire. Their pioneering partnership was not dissolved officially until 1922, but there is no evidence for any film production after 1913. James Kenyon moved to Southport in 1915, but returned to Blackburn, where he died at his home, 28 Granville Road, on 6 February 1925. He was buried in Blackburn cemetery. The diplomatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67498/', "Sir Frank Kenyon Roberts")</script> was his grandson. Sagar Jones Mitchell, who had continued with his Northgate photographic business in partnership with his son John, died at his home, Whitecroft, Quaker Brook Lane, Hoghton, Lancashire, on 2 October 1952.<br>
<br>Until recently Mitchell and Kenyon were remembered as being a &#145;small but hardy company which sprung up early in England&#146;, and which had &#145;left little trace&#146;  (Low and Manvell, 22&#150;3). The discovery and subsequent acquisition of the Peter Worden Mitchell and Kenyon collection by the National Film and Television Archive in 2000 changed this perception and revealed the largest collection of films in the United Kingdom from the early 1900s made by a single company. Approximately 800 nitrate negatives have been restored and researched by the National Film and Television Archive in association with the National Fairground Archive. Examples of the restored footage were broadcast by the BBC in 2005. The collection has brought to light the contribution of film-makers in the north of England to the development of early British cinema, alongside the previously better-known Brighton school and London-based companies. It has also changed the emphasis of film history by revealing the importance of non-fiction production in the development of British film-making and exhibition. Mitchell and Kenyon's local films indicate how early British companies exploited a genre that continued to thrive in Europe and America well into the 1930s. Films of local people and events kept the crowds coming, and were an important factor in the development of the cinema audience in the early 1900s. The significance of the Mitchell and Kenyon collection is that it not only reveals the types of material shown but also allows us to view the audience that went to see it.<br>
