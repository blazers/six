<span class="headword">Pateman,  Jack Edward</span>  (1921&#150;2004), <span class="occ">aviation engineer and businessman</span>, was born on 29 November 1921 in West Somerton, Norfolk, the son of William Edward Pateman, head gamekeeper, and his wife, Lucy Varley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jetten. After attending Great Yarmouth grammar school he served in the RAF from 1939 until 1946. He then joined Belling and Lee as a research engineer. He began his life's career on joining Elliott Brothers' circuits division in 1948. Elliott Brothers (London) Ltd, under Leon Bagrit, was an industrial automation pioneer, and Pateman foresaw how computer technology could also benefit systems for aircraft. Typical of the Elliott organization were specialist divisions as profit centres. At the age of thirty Pateman founded Elliott Brothers (London) Ltd Aviation Division, at Borehamwood. On 27 August 1949 he had married Cecily Hope (Cicely) Turner (<i>b</i>. 1924), the daughter of Alfred Ebenezer Turner, tailor. They had a daughter, Susan, and a son, John.<br>
<br>One of Pateman's earliest tasks at Elliott Brothers was to manufacture the automatic pilot for the Jindivik target drone. This was followed by the design and manufacture of an autopilot for the Lightning interceptor, Europe's first for a supersonic aircraft. Other major projects included automatic flight control systems, a field in which Pateman was at one time a patent holder, for the Harrier, the Tornado, and the European Typhoon fighter, and for the VC-10, BAC One&#150;Eleven, Concorde, and Boeing 777 airliners, the 777 being the first Boeing aircraft with &#145;fly-by-wire&#146; flight control. Secondary flight controls were also produced for various models of the European Airbus. Among the company's most outstanding products were aircraft head up displays, air data computers, and airborne radar, antisubmarine sonar, and automatic landing systems.<br>
<br>Pateman's avionics company won six queen's awards for technological achievement and eight for export, principally in the highly competitive American market. At its peak, 16,000 people were employed worldwide. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when many industries were declining, a growing need for suitable engineering graduates meant recruiting from Australia. Avionics, which Pateman promoted as an industry in its own right, became the most valuable part of collaborative military aircraft projects, but governments would not support UK avionics against competition from subsidized European companies. Pateman was in 1979 one of the founding sponsors of the Industrial Avionics Working Group, to enable UK companies to compete successfully on European aircraft projects.<br>
<br>Throughout Pateman's career aviation experienced successive industrial regroupings and mergers. Elliotts merged with English Electric, and hence Marconi, in 1967, which in turn was taken over by Arnold Weinstock's General Electric Company in 1968. Throughout Pateman showed a genius for his company's survival, becoming deputy chairman and joint managing director of Elliott Flight Automation from 1962 to 1971, and a director of GEC Computers Ltd from 1971 to 1989 (chairman, 1978&#150;82). He was a director of Canadian Marconi (1971&#150;87), GEC-Marconi (China) Ltd (1979&#150;89), Marconi Electrical Devices Ltd (1980&#150;87), GEC Avionics Projects Ltd (1980&#150;89), GEC Information Systems (1982&#150;6), GEC Avionics Projects (UK) Ltd (1984&#150;9), GEC-Marconi Ltd (1987&#150;9), and GEC itself (1986&#150;8). He retired in 1989, after which his avionics organization became part of BAE Systems Ltd.<br>
<br>Pateman was one of a breed of British engineering originals: imaginative technicians themselves, who also pioneered new industries and created world-class businesses. Despite the scale, diversity, and complexity of the businesses he ran, he was always approachable, and his calm and caution inspired his directors and senior managers. Faced with problems, he never put subordinates into the firing line. In stoutly defending the team which developed the controversial Nimrod early warning radar he attracted public criticism to himself, which those who knew him realized had damaged his reputation unfairly. He hated flamboyance and never looked for accolades, although many were bestowed. He was appointed CBE in 1970 and was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1981. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering the same year. After retirement, he became chairman of the Kent County Engineering Society (1989&#150;96).<br>
<br>Pateman's lifelong recreations were gardening and sailing. His sloop, <i>Oenanthe</i>, regularly cruised in France, Holland, and the east coast of England, including the River Blackwater, to support annual dinghy races between the Rochester team and the Marconi Sailing Club, of which he was president for several years. Many colleagues sailed with him. A golden rule was never to discuss business on board. In his latter years this would be called bonding. He would have scoffed at that and called it having fun. He died at Maidstone Hospital on 28 August 2004 of multiple organ failure after an emergency operation. After cremation at Tunbridge Wells a memorial service was held at St Peter's Church, Ightham, on 15 September. He was survived by his wife, Cicely, and their two children.<br>
