<span class="headword">Sigeberht</span>  (<em>d.</em> 757), <span class="occ">king of the West Saxons</span>, became king on the death of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6979/', "Cuthred")</script> in 756 and was murdered the following year. He is not named in any of the extant genealogies of the West Saxon kings, and nothing definite is known of his ancestry and connections, except that he had a brother, Cyneheard. According to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, Cyneheard was descended in the paternal line from Cerdic, but such claims cannot be taken at face value since genealogies were sometimes manipulated to provide the descent which was considered to confer legal title to rule. Virtually nothing is known of Sigeberht's brief reign, but he is recorded as granting lands in what are now Somerset and Dorset, possibly to the monasteries of Glastonbury and Sherborne respectively.<br>
<br>Sigeberht's rule was successfully challenged in 757 by Cynewulf, who obtained the support of most of the West Saxon councillors. For a while Sigeberht retained a power base in the area of modern Hampshire and the support of Ealdorman Cumbra; but eventually he killed Cumbra and was driven out into the weald, probably in Sussex. On venturing back westwards, he was stabbed to death at Privett (near modern Petersfield) by a swineherd who was avenging the ealdorman.<br>
<br>The fact that Cyneheard attempted to secure the kingship twenty-nine years later, when he fought and killed Cynewulf, suggests that the brothers were very young in 756&#150;7, and the unjust acts which the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> mentions as the cause of Sigeberht's loss of support in Wessex may have been the errors of youth and inexperience. Nothing in his story suggests that he was very capable, and he presumably acquired the kingship for other reasons, possibly as the rightful heir of his predecessor. Cumbra, who stood by him longest, was an ealdorman in the reign of Cuthred and it is possible that Sigeberht and Cyneheard were the sons of Cuthred. Cyneheard was buried at Axminster, but Sigeberht's place of burial is not recorded.<br>
