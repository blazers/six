<span class="headword">Tracy,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1530), <span class="occ">landowner and religious radical</span>, was the son of Sir Henry Tracy (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1506) of Toddington, Gloucestershire, and Alice Baldington, daughter and coheir of Thomas Baldington of Oxfordshire. He was married to Margaret or Margery Throckmorton, daughter of Thomas Throckmorton (1462&#150;1530/31) of Coughton, Warwickshire, and Margaret <i>n&eacute;e</i> Olney; his sister-in-law, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1547), was the last abbess of Denny, near Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire. William Tracy's sister, also Elizabeth, was married to Sir Alexander Bainham of Westbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire, a very prominent member of the county's gentry; their youngest son, James, would be burnt at Smithfield for his evangelical beliefs in 1532. William Tracy was an active member of the Gloucestershire &eacute;lite, serving as sheriff in 1513 and on numerous commissions of the peace. He was also connected to other prominent families in the county, not only serving as a feoffee of the estate of Sir Alexander Bainham and as an executor of Elizabeth Bainham's will, but also as one of the executors of the will of Dame Joan Huddleston, widow of Sir John, daughter of Sir Miles Stapleton of Norfolk, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas de la Pole.<br>
<br>Although nothing is known concerning Tracy's education, he was learned, and by the time of his death had developed a clearly evangelical theology. In the 1520s, while carrying out his duties as a JP, he had become acquainted with William Tyndale, the evangelical biblical scholar who was then residing in the county. Tyndale later described him as &#145;a learned man and better sene in the workes of Sainct Austine &hellip; than ever I knew doctoure in Englande&#146;  (<span class="italic">Testament</span>). Tracy's learning, and more particularly his theology, may well have been influenced by his contact with Tyndale, and he in turn may have influenced his nephew, James Bainham. The nature of Tracy's beliefs became most apparent after he died at Toddington, on 10 October 1530, when his remarkable will began to circulate all over England. This will, in which he proclaimed his complete assurance in the salvation of his soul and eschewed all works and prayers as means of salvation, was circulating in London by 1531, made available by an unknown hand. That same year it was refused probate by the prerogative court of Canterbury and condemned by convocation; Tracy was declared a heretic and orders were given to remove his body from consecrated soil. The chancellor of the diocese of Worcester had the body exhumed, but overstepped his authority by having it burnt, and was subsequently fined &pound;300 for his actions.<br>
<br>However, William Tracy's words could not be silenced by official or semi-official action. Four years after he was declared a heretic and his body was burnt, his will was published in Antwerp with commentaries by William Tyndale and John Frith, and its influence was soon visible in the religious portions of the wills of others. In 1537 William Shepard, of Mendlesham in Suffolk, incorporated Tracy's will in its entirety into his own, adding explanatory passages and paragraphs to clarify his understanding of its content. New editions of the will were then published in 1546 and 1548, and their influence can be seen in a number of wills written all over England between 1548 and 1640. These appropriated portions of Tracy's will and modified them to create their own distinctive but recognizable evangelical religious preambles. William Tracy thus provided a model of evangelical or protestant rhetoric for those crafting religious statements for their wills, a model that outlived him by over 100 years.<br>
