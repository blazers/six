<span class="headword">Walker,  Henry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1638&#150;1660), <span class="occ">journalist and preacher</span>, was born in Derbyshire of unknown parentage. On 28 October 1638 he was admitted a pensioner at Queens' College, Cambridge; though he appears not to have proceeded BA, he claimed to have been ordained a deacon by a representative of the bishop of Lincoln. He apparently worked as an ironmonger (apprenticed to a Mr Holland in Newgate market), served out his apprenticeship, but was unsuccessful at the trade. This would suggest that his Cambridge career followed his apprenticeship, though the account of his mechanic years may be exaggerated, if not fabricated. He subsequently became involved in the book trade as a bookseller (vending anti-episcopal books) and author. At the same time he operated as a preacher, a &#145;tub&#146; or &#145;mechanic&#146; preacher (meaning a preacher without a benefice, usually of Independent or nonconformist tendencies). In his <span class="italic">Modest Vindication</span> (1642), Walker professes, &#145;I was never yet a member of any separated congregation&#146;  (p. 6).<br>
<br>During 1641 Walker was repeatedly in trouble for writings and publications. In March he was briefly committed to the Fleet prison for two libellous pamphlets provocatively conflating episcopacy with popery, <span class="italic">The Prelates Pride</span> and <span class="italic">Verses on the Wren and Finch</span>. In December 1641 the Commons sent for him as a delinquent. Sudden notoriety came on 5 January 1642 when he threw into the king's carriage a pamphlet (now lost) entitled <span class="italic">To Your Tents, O Israel</span>. He was arrested, escaped, and was recaptured before coming to trial. He denied authorship but was convicted on the testimony of the printer. After begging the king's pardon he was sentenced to the pillory.<br>
<br>During 1642 Walker engaged in a pamphlet exchange with John Taylor, who repeatedly stigmatized him as an ignoramus ironmonger and a scandalous preacher. Except when engaged in polemical mud-slinging Walker's tone was conciliatory, godly, informed, and submissive to the king. During the 1640s he published about thirty pamphlets (his anonymity makes certain attribution difficult), including an eight-page history of the church, proposals for further reformation of the English church, proposals to reform parliament, and a short exposition of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> based on lectures delivered at the academy of Balthasar Gerbier. Walker's learning was not extensive, and he did not wear it lightly, but like others he acquired during the 1640s rudimentary knowledge of Hebrew.<br>
<br>Walker's career took a new turn in January 1644 when he began to edit a newsbook, initially entitled <span class="italic">Occurrences of Certain Speciall and Remarkable Passages</span> and subsequently <span class="italic">Perfect Occurrences</span>. For this and other items he used the anagrammatic pseudonym Luke Harruney. The newsbook spoke to his religious nonconformity, journalistic ambition, and political opinions, including close support for Cromwell. It also pioneered an innovative element in newsbooks, perhaps a precursor of the crossword puzzle: from 1648 each issue began with a Hebrew transliteration of the name of a figure prominent in the news, which was then translated back into English to obtain a hidden meaning. Walker's relationship with parliament was chequered. He was questioned in March and April 1647 for expressions in <span class="italic">Perfect Occurrences</span>, and asked to verify a report therein; in the same year he was given a privilege for printing army papers. In 1648 and 1649 he successfully struggled to retain possession of his title. Walker petitioned for the right to be his own licenser in January 1649; this was granted but suspended by the Lords, and events soon overtook Walker's ambition. <span class="italic">Perfect Occurrences</span> disappeared in October 1649, killed off by the Commonwealth's act against unlicensed and scandalous books and pamphlets. One of the weekly newsbooks authorized following the act was <span class="italic">Severall Proceedings in Parliament</span>, apparently edited by Henry Scobell, clerk to the parliament; Walker later took control of this title and edited it until a second newsbook purge in 1655.<br>
<br>It is likely that Walker was involved in other short-lived periodicals, less colourful than <span class="italic">Perfect Occurrences</span>, most probably <span class="italic">A Perfect Summary of Chiefe Passages in Parliament</span> (1646); <span class="italic">Packets of Letters</span> (1648); <span class="italic">A Declaration, Collected out of the Journalls of Both Houses of Parliament</span> (1648); and <span class="italic">Tuesdaies Journall of Perfect Passages in Parliament</span> (1649). His newsbooks profited from advertising, and in August 1649 he advertised an &#145;Office of Entries&#146; at the Fountain in King's Street, Westminster. In 1647 an anonymous pamphleteer remonstrated of Walker: &#145;I do think that his, and many other scurillous Pamphlets, have done more mischief in this Kingdome then ever all my Lord of <i>Essex's</i> or Sir <i>Thomas Fairfaxes</i> whole train of Artillery ever did&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Fresh Whip</span>, London, 1647, 6). Walker's contemporary notoriety was chiefly as a newsbook editor, perhaps second only to Marchamont Nedham in prominence, in which trade he was competent and engaging if not eloquent.<br>
<br>Wood credits Walker with responsibility for editing selections from <span class="italic">A Conference about the Next Succession</span> (1595) by the Jesuits William Allen and Robert Persons, which was published as <span class="italic">Severall speeches at a conference concerning the power of parliament, to proceed against their king for misgovernment</span> (1648[1649]), and reports that Walker was rewarded with &pound;30 for his pains. Walker preached in the king's chapel at Whitehall on 15 July 1649, which sermon was printed. Perhaps it was not only because of his red hair and beard, but on account of his former expressions of allegiance to the king, that royalist pamphleteers nicknamed Walker Judas; they also labelled him a Jew, presumably because of his interest in Hebrew, and described his sexual predilections and the promiscuous conduct of his wife. The only two known contemporary likenesses of Walker are unlikely to be accurate: both appear in woodcuts on title-pages of John Taylor's pamphlets <span class="italic">A Reply as True as Steele</span> (1641), showing Walker being discharged from the anus of the devil, and <span class="italic">A Seasonable Lecture</span> (1642), showing Walker preaching from a tub.<br>
<br>Royalist journalists also report in August 1649 that Walker was given a benefice at Uxbridge, Middlesex, with a stipend of &pound;100. A printed sermon delivered by him before Cromwell at Somerset House on 27 June 1650 describes him as &#145;minister of Gods word, at Knightsbridge in Middlesex&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached in the Chappell at Somerset-House</span>, 1650). He was appointed to the living of St Martin Vintry, College Hill, London, in 1655. He may have been the author of a pamphlet describing Cromwell's last hours published in 1659, which described its author as a groom of the protector's bedchamber and an eyewitness to his death. His last extant publication is <span class="italic">Serious Observations Lately Made, Touching his Majesty Charles the Second</span> (1660), a royalist work that began with one of his Hebrew word plays. He may have been appointed to the chapel at Hounslow, Middlesex, in 1664; otherwise nothing further is heard of him.<br>
