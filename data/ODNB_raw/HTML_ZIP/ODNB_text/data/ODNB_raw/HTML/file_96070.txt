<span class="headword">Warren,  Eleanor Catherine Rutherford</span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">cellist</span>, was born at 65 Addison Road, Kensington, London, on 5 June 1919, the daughter of William Rutherford Warren, a retired army captain, and his wife, Elsa Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Seligman. Her German-born mother was a serious amateur cellist, and at the age of five Warren became the youngest ever student at the London Cello School in Nottingham Place, where her contemporaries included Zara Nelsova and Olga Hegedus. She soon began to win prizes at competitions and festivals and in 1933 played for Gregor Piatigorsky, who gave her regular help and encouragement on his London visits. She gained further experience through work in London chamber orchestras and freelance orchestral engagements. Piatigorsky introduced her to the agent Harold Holt, who arranged her Wigmore Hall d&eacute;but concert in 1935, just after her sixteenth birthday. She received excellent reviews and was soon appearing at Holt celebrity concerts with such artists as John McCormack, Richard Tauber, and Paul Robeson. Solo and concerto dates soon followed, in England, Holland, Belgium, and Canada.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, like many other artists, Warren played for the armed services, factory workers, and hospitals in extremely arduous and sometimes dangerous conditions. Concerts were also given in the underground, where crowds congregated at night to escape the blitz. In 1942 Warren attended a concert at the Czech embassy, where she was struck by the musicianship of the Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; (Jan) Walter Susskind (1913&#150;1980), then pianist of the Czech Trio and already a noted conductor. He was the son of Bruno Susskind, accountant. They married on 22 December 1943 and her life took a new direction. The birth of their son, Peter, in 1944 meant a challenging mix of motherhood, practice, and engagements.<br>
<br>Walter Susskind became chief conductor of the Scottish Orchestra, from 1946 to 1952, and life was divided between Glasgow and London. After the war it was at last possible to travel abroad, and Warren studied with Pierre Fournier in Paris and Switzerland and, in 1949, with Pablo Casals in Prades. Susskind left Britain in 1953 for the Victorian Symphony Orchestra in Melbourne. Their marriage ended at this time and Warren plunged headlong into the London scene, working with the English Chamber Orchestra, the London Mozart Players, the Zorian Quartet, and the English Baroque Ensemble, as well as undertaking regular film sessions with Malcolm Arnold, Richard Rodney Bennett, and Jacques Loussier.<br>
<br>A back injury forced Warren to abandon the cello, and in 1964 her second career began when she joined the BBC as a music assistant, soon broadcasting and devising programmes and series (including <span class="italic">This Week's Composer</span>), for which she proved to have immense flair. In the 1970s she devised a new series of live recitals from the concert hall in Broadcasting House, featuring artists of the younger generation. Graham Johnson discovered, long after the fact, that she had secured his first BBC broadcasts.<br>
<br>After wartime bomb damage the church of St John's, Smith Square, had been rebuilt in 1969 as a concert hall. Warren realized the potential of the building and created the highly successful BBC Monday lunchtime concerts, which mixed some of the great performers and ensembles with emerging artists, from whom she had an uncanny knack of picking winners. It was, for example, Warren's suggestion that led to the creation of the Pauk&#150;Kirshbaum&#150;Frankl Piano Trio. She was promoted to chief producer in 1971 and became closely involved with the Leeds piano competition. Four years later she was appointed head of music programmes, BBC Radio. Sir Nicholas Kenyon, one of her staff at that time, later fondly recalled her interest in the most junior members, nurturing and guiding their progress with care and affection. It was in some respects a fulfilling role for her, but she frequently felt frustrated by BBC bureaucracy.<br>
<br>In 1977 a tempting offer from John Manduell led Warren to accept the post of head of strings at the newly created Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Her innate interest in young performers made the role perfect for her, and she quickly placed chamber music at the heart of the department. She established a tradition of recitals and master classes from the greatest musicians, including Pierre Fournier, the Vermeer Quartet, Julian Bream, and John Williams. As ever, her principal concern was for the students, and she inevitably became involved in the BBC young musician of the year competition when it began in 1978 at the college.<br>
<br>In 1984 Warren decided to return to London and was asked by John Hosier, principal of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, to establish a system for embedding chamber music in the school. The following year Michael Gough Matthews, director of the Royal College of Music, asked her to become chamber music director. She continued in both posts for the next ten years. In 1911 she was appointed MBE. After her retirement in 1996 she remained constantly in demand as adjudicator, adviser, and mentor, and was delighted when Ralph Kirshbaum, one of the many cellists whom she befriended, created the Manchester International Cello Festival at the Royal Northern College of Music.<br>
<br>As cellist, broadcaster, and teacher, Eleanor Warren successfully fulfilled three careers in her long life and touched the lives of countless musicians, who appreciated her passion for music, her razor-sharp mind, and her wicked sense of humour. She died at the BUPA Hospital, Gartree Road, Oadby, Leicestershire, on 25 August 2005, of cancer, and was survived by her son.<br>
