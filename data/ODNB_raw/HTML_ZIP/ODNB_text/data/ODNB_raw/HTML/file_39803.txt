<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Daniel,  Glyn Edmund</span>  (1914&#150;1986), <span class="occ">archaeologist and writer</span>, was born on 23 April 1914 at Llanbedr Felffre, Pembrokeshire, the only child of John Daniel, schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Jane Edmunds. He was educated in his father's school at Llantwit Major (where they moved in 1919), and then at Barry county school, of which he had many happy memories, vividly recorded in his autobiography <span class="italic">Some Small Harvest</span> (1986). He gained a place for 1932 at St John's College, Cambridge, spending the preceding year at University College, Cardiff, studying geology and the organ. Turning to the archaeology and anthropology tripos at St John's, after getting a first in the qualifying examination for the geography tripos (1933), he graduated with first classes in both section A (1934) and section B (1935, with distinction). He continued as a research student at St John's with a Strathcona studentship, receiving also an Allen scholarship in 1937. The remarkable megalithic monuments of western Europe formed the subject of his research, both in Britain (his doctoral dissertation of 1938 being published in 1950 as <span class="italic">The Prehistoric Chamber Tombs of England and Wales</span>), and in France, where his first visit to Brittany in 1936 resulted eventually in <span class="italic">The Prehistoric Chamber Tombs of France</span> (1960), with an authoritative overview of the whole subject in <span class="italic">The Megalith Builders of Western Europe</span> (1958). His doctoral dissertation won him a research fellowship at St John's in 1938, but his tenure was interrupted by the Second World War. He served as an intelligence officer in the RAF (1940&#150;45), during which time he was officer in charge of photo interpretation, India and south-east Asia (1942&#150;5), rose to the rank of wing commander, and was mentioned in dispatches. In India he met his future wife, Ruth (<i>d</i>. 2000), daughter of the Revd Richard William Bailey Langhorne, headmaster of Exeter Cathedral choristers' school. They were married in 1946, and their happy partnership formed thereafter a central part of his life. They had no children.<br>
<br>On his return from India, Daniel resumed his fellowship at St John's, another significant and enduring strand in his life, serving as steward from 1946 to 1955. He was made assistant lecturer in the department of archaeology in 1945, becoming lecturer, then reader, and then, in 1974, Disney professor and head of department until his retirement in 1981. He received a Cambridge LittD in 1962. Already with his first major publication, <span class="italic">The Three Ages</span> (1943), he showed an acute awareness of the relevance of the history of archaeology to current archaeological research. His <span class="italic">A Hundred Years of Archaeology</span> (1950), a pioneering study in the history of archaeology, perhaps his most important contribution, was followed by several others, including <span class="italic">The Idea of Prehistory</span> (1962).<br>
<br>As a teacher Daniel excelled in kindling the enthusiasm of his pupils, many of whom became also his friends. He held that &#145;friendship is a conspiracy for pleasure&#146;, and while food and drink habitually formed part of that pleasure (a point well documented in <span class="italic">The Hungry Archaeologist in France</span>, 1963, as also in <span class="italic">Oxford Chicken Pie</span>, 1965), people mattered more. His keen eye for character is deployed in his two detective novels (<span class="italic">The Cambridge Murders</span>, 1945, and <span class="italic">Welcome Death</span>, 1954), and his ebullient sense of humour comes over well in the small, privately published <span class="italic">The Pen of my Aunt</span> (1961). His love affair with France was consummated in 1964 by the purchase of a house in the Pas-de-Calais, which he and his wife visited frequently until the year of his death.<br>
<br>While Daniel's most influential academic work was in the history of archaeology, his greatest impact on the archaeology of post-war Britain was as a communicator, not least as chairman of the highly successful television panel game <span class="italic">Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?</span>, which made both Sir Mortimer Wheeler and Glyn Daniel household names and brought them the accolade of television personality of the year in 1954 and 1955 respectively. Daniel was a founding director of Anglia Television from 1959 to 1981. He was a brilliant and entertaining speaker, and his public lectures and broadcasts made him widely known and recognized. As editor of the <span class="roman">Ancient People and Places</span> series for Thames and Hudson he commissioned over 100 volumes. He became editor of <span class="italic">Antiquity</span> in 1958, following the death of its founder editor O. G. S. Crawford the previous year. Yet he was not elected a fellow of the British Academy (where his role as a popularizer may have counted against him) until 1982.<br>
<br>Daniel was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries from 1942, and served as president of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1977&#150;9. A corresponding fellow of many learned societies overseas, he became a knight (first class) of the Dannebrog in 1961: Princess Margrethe of Denmark, like the prince of Wales, had been among his many distinguished pupils. His scholarly contributions will be remembered, and yet the sheer humanity and zest that sparkle from his <span class="italic">Antiquity</span> editorials (of which <span class="italic">Writing for Antiquity</span>, 1992, forms an anthology), and from the pages of <span class="italic">Some Small Harvest</span>, give as valid an insight into a remarkable teacher and scholar. A non-smoker, after a short illness he died of lung cancer in Cambridge on 13 December 1986. His ashes were scattered in the fellows' garden at St John's College.<br>
