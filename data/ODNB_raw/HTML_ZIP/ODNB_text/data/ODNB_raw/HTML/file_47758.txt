</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sapru, Sir Tej Bahadur</span>  (1875&#150;1949), <span class="occ">Indian nationalist and political mediator</span>, was born in Aligarh on 8 December 1875, of a Kashmiri Pandit family, the son of Ambika Prasad Sapru, and grandson of Radha Khrishen Sapru, of the Indian provincial service. He married Durga Devi Madan in 1888; the couple had two daughters and three sons: Prakash Narain Sapru, later a judge of the Allahabad high court, Anand Narain Sapru, of the Indian Civil Service, and Triyugi Narain Sapru, later professor of law at Allahabad University. Sapru's wife died in 1910, and thereafter he remained notoriously shy with women. Much influenced by Professor Andrews, a close follower of John Stuart Mill, he took first-class honours in English at Agra College, in both his bachelor's (1894) and his master's degrees (1895). He also took an LLM at Allahabad University (1895) and an LLD (1902)&#151;only the second person to do so.<br>
<br>Sapru began practising law in Moradabad in 1896, but in 1898 moved to Allahabad where, at 19 Albert Road, he spent the rest of his life. There in 1906 he was admitted as an advocate, making him the equal of members of the English bar. In due course he became arguably the most distinguished lawyer in India, appearing not only in Allahabad and Lucknow, but in Calcutta, Madras, and Lahore, and was in frequent demand by Indian landlords and princes too. He was at the same time a considerable scholar in Persian, and a leading devotee of Urdu poetry, language, and literature.<br>
<br>From an early age Sapru was interested in the Indian National Congress, and by his own lights remained a staunch Indian nationalist. He first spoke at the Madras Congress in 1908, and was closely involved with the 1910 Congress in Allahabad. In 1913 he was nominated to the United Provinces' legislative council and there led a campaign for a governor-in-council to bring the province into line with Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. In 1914 he became president of the United Provinces' provincial political conference, and in 1916 played a major part in the Lucknow pact between Congress and the Muslim League which sought to reconcile Hindu and Muslim political interests. In that year he was elected to the central legislative council. By now he was seen by some younger nationalists such as Jawaharlal Nehru as their potential leader. Energetic in seeking further constitutional reforms, he was incensed at the government's treatment of Annie Besant. He was, however, substantially assuaged by the Montagu declaration of 1917 promising India eventual self-government, and by the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms which ensued. While vehement in his opposition to the <span class="roman">Rowlatt Acts</span> of 1919, he joined with other leading &#145;moderates&#146; to break away from the Congress in 1918 to form what became the National Liberal Federation to work the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms to the full. By the time of M. K. Gandhi's accession to Congress's leadership he was thus no longer a member.<br>
<br>While always retaining a high personal regard for Gandhi, the deep commitments he had now developed to the rule of law, and to pursuing British precedents for the attainment of self-government without revolutionary upheaval, Sapru found it impossible to join Gandhi in non-co-operation and civil disobedience. Instead he served on the Feetham committee on the allocation of governmental functions, appeared before the joint select committee of the British parliament on Indian reforms in 1919, and in 1920 accepted appointment as law member of the viceroy's council. There, apart from instituting some notable reforms, for example by removing racial distinctions in the criminal procedure code, he not only successfully urged the viceroy, Lord Reading, not to arrest Gandhi until he had called off his non-co-operation campaign, but late in 1921 played the pivotal role in persuading Reading to call a round-table conference which, if Gandhi had been more adroit, could well have initiated further reforms that did not come for another fifteen years.<br>
<br>Sapru retired from the viceroy's council in 1922 and was made a KCIE. In 1923 he was a delegate to the Imperial Conference (where he had a notable clash with General Smuts over the rights of South Africa's Indian minority) and became (as again in 1927) president of the National Liberal Federation. During the 1920s he was more intimately involved than anyone else in discussions about Indian constitutional reforms, and became as he remained the greatest constitutional expert on either the Indian or the British side. Closely involved with Besant's commonwealth of India proposals in 1923, he served in 1924 on the government-appointed Muddiman reforms inquiry committee and contributed to its important minority report.<br>
<br>Along with so many others Sapru was outraged by the appointment of the all-white Simon commission on Indian constitutional reforms in 1927, and not only supported its boycott, but played a large part in drafting the Indian riposte, the Nehru report of 1928. He was then foremost in persuading the next viceroy to make the Irwin declaration of October 1929 promising further constitutional reform and a round-table conference in London. Despite an initial success he was twice frustrated, however, in persuading Congress's leaders to attend the conference, first by their launching of civil disobedience in March 1930, and then, in association with M. R. Jayakar, in the Yeravda gaol discussions with Gandhi and the Nehrus the following summer. He and a good many others none the less went to London, where Sapru was pre-eminent in winning the Indian princes' support for an Indian federation, thereby securing the British government's support for further constitutional reforms. On returning to India he and his associates were rewarded by the Gandhi&#150;Irwin pact of March 1931 under which civil disobedience was suspended and Gandhi agreed to attend a second round-table conference in London later that year. That conference, however, was fruitless, deeply riven by communal issues (which led Sapru to resign from the Liberal Party for its involvement in these), and upon Gandhi's return to India civil disobedience was renewed.<br>
<br>During 1932 Sapru played a principal part in negotiating the Poona pact with Gandhi and a range of Hindu orthodox and untouchable leaders that sought to resolve the constitutional position of India's untouchables. He was to the fore, too, among those successfully denouncing the apparent decision of the British to abandon the conference method for framing constitutional reforms, and attended both a third conference and the discussions of the joint select committee on Indian constitutional reforms, which finally led to the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935. For his major contributions to these Sapru was sworn of the privy council, but in India found himself relegated to the political sidelines. From there he was brought back in 1941, not least by Gandhi, to act as a mediator between Congress and the Muslim League, and between Congress and the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow. His principal instrument was a series of non-party conferences over which he presided for several years. He failed in 1941 to persuade Linlithgow to countenance an Indian national government which for the duration of the Second World War would be &#145;responsible to the Crown&#146;, but by dispatching an open telegram to Churchill early in 1942 he succeeded brilliantly in precipitating Sir Stafford Cripps's mission to India and its accompanying promise that India would have independence at the end of the war. He was considerably less successful with Jinnah and the Muslim League, despite one final effort through the Sapru report of 1945 which epitomized all his constitutional expertise.<br>
<br>Sapru appeared briefly in 1946 for the defence in the Indian National Army trials, but by then had Parkinson's disease. Had he been well he would very probably have chaired the Indian constituent assembly. Although he had for many years been spurned by Jawaharlal Nehru, they were touchingly reconciled at the end. With India independent under the rule of law and a parliamentary democracy, Sapru died well content, despite his dismay at India's partition, in Allahabad on 20 January 1949.<br>
