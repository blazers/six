<span class="headword">Thomson <span class="st"> [Thompson]</span>,  Maurice</span>  (1604&#150;1676), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Watton, Hertfordshire, the eldest son and third child in the minor gentry family of five sons and four daughters of Robert Thompson of Cheshunt and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Halfehead. One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27299/', "George Thomson")</script>, parliamentarian. He arrived in Virginia at the age of twelve or thirteen, perhaps as one learning seamanship. He quickly established himself near the settlement of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27792/', "William Tucker")</script>, who had married his sister Mary and brought over three of their younger brothers. Thomson was married twice, first to Ellen Owen on 12 August 1628, and second to Dorothy Vaux. Their children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27269/', "John Thompson (later first Baron Haversham)")</script>, Maurice, who died in infancy, and four daughters, Mary, Katherine, Martha, and Elizabeth. Thomson and his partners (probably his three brothers) enjoyed a short-lived monopoly to market the entire tobacco crop, supplied provisions amid protests by the planters about engrossing (1632&#150;3), participated in a huge land grant (1636), and came to dominate the tobacco trade, Thomson paying the largest duties on imports into England in 1642.<br>
<br>With other partners Thomson developed wider markets. He brought slaves to their 1000 acre plantation on St Kitts (1626), entered the North American&#150;Canadian fur and provisioning trades (1631), re-exported tobacco to Europe with an agent in Amsterdam (1638&#150;9), and interloped against the Levant and Guinea companies. Other triangular trade centred on the East Indies, where he had been associated with the interloping of Sir William Courteen against the East India Company from the late 1630s. Leading dissident merchants, he was elected a director of the company in 1647, gaining a majority for a &#145;free well-regulated trade&#146; and an expansive policy including colonization, voyages to the Far East, incorporation of the west African trade, and compensation from the Dutch for the interlopers (1649&#150;50). The council of state ordered a settlement, but Thomson's group won only a partial victory. The East India Company was re-capitalized and he was elected governor, but the joint-stock system was retained (1657).<br>
<br>Thomson had been prominent in trade, colonization, and legalized piracy in the Caribbean, and in enterprises such as Providence Island, favoured by Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick, John Pym, and opposition leaders (1639&#150;42). He presented to the king in York a huge petition from Londoners for a parliament, and signed Pym's petition against Spain (1640) and another critical of the Lords after the Irish rising (1641). He was much involved in Irish land investment and naval actions and led a mission to the Netherlands for relief of Irish protestants (1643). He was an early recruit to the Honourable Artillery Company (1628), to the London militia committee (1642), and to his local Tower Hamlets militia (1647&#150;60). Among the three richest men in Billingsgate ward in 1640, he was a commissioner for contributions in London, Middlesex, and Westminster (1642), and for customs (1643&#150;7), a plum of parliamentary finance.<br>
<br>A stream of offices followed, showing both Thomson's high standing with the parliamentary leadership and his commercial prominence: he joined in the pacification of Kent; recovered mutinous ships in the Netherlands; and held appointments to trade committees, the high court of justice, and the excise (1645&#150;54). Thomson and other merchants were consulted by the government when some of the colonies sought independent policies. Trade with them was forbidden, and Thomson himself sailed with the fleet in an expedition which forced the colonies to submit (1650&#150;55). He was a major war contractor whose interests extended to nascent industrial enterprises, such as the growing sugar capitalism of the West Indies, the mines, works, and specialist timbers of the East, and saltpetre imports and gunpowder production at home. He influenced the first <span class="roman">Navigation Act</span> (1650), when foreign ships were banned from the colonies, but in the second act (1651) the trade was opened. The new merchants lacked the political power to prevail. When Thomson and other radicals signed a petition against the dismissal of the Rump (1653), Oliver Cromwell dismissed them from their offices and contracts. But Thomson was soon back in favour again, receiving instructions on the management of the impending war with Spain in the Caribbean from the protector, who told him to liaise with the fleet commanders (1654), and joining an enlarged trade committee (1655).<br>
<br>Thomson's religious outlook was consistently that of an Independent puritan: he was a petitioner in St Dunstan-in-the-East for a radical lecturer (1642), a regularly elected vestryman and parish leader, a trier (1645&#150;8), and a Middlesex commissioner judging scandalous ministers (1654). He was left undisturbed at the Restoration, though he lost his place as a Trinity brother. An informer's report (1666) accusing him of treason with the Dutch and always opposing &#145;kingly government&#146; was ignored. He even sailed with the fleet to Barbados (1667). Almost to the last he kept his director's seat in the East India Company, attending over half the courts in a year (1672&#150;3).<br>
<br>Thomson died in 1676 and was buried at Haversham church. In his will he left &pound;1 each to &#145;100 poor silenced ministers&#146;, and properties in England, Ireland, Virginia, and throughout the Caribbean.<br>
