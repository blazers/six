<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Angus</span>  (1836&#150;1886), <span class="occ">obstetrician</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 18 April 1836, the son of James Macdonald (<i>d</i>. 1846), road contractor, and Margaret Bannerman. He had little schooling until after the death of his father, when his mother, a woman of character and intellect, moved with her young family to Grange in Banffshire; he then attended Grange parish school, being taught by an inspiring schoolmaster, Arthur Gerrard. Macdonald received only a total of two years of formal education, having to work as an agricultural labourer while studying; however, Gerrard gave him a thorough grounding in Latin, which enabled him to sit the bursary competition for King's College, Aberdeen, and to win an award at the comparatively late age of nineteen. Macdonald matriculated in arts in 1855 and followed the four-year course, tutoring during term-time and labouring at home in the summer and autumn. He graduated MA in 1859 and left Aberdeen to read theology at the Divinity Hall of the United Presbyterian church in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>After one session of theology Macdonald found he was more interested in medicine, and in 1860 he entered the medical faculty of Edinburgh University, without abandoning his deeply held religious beliefs. His teachers included James Syme, John Goodsir, Robert Christison, J. Y. Simpson, and J. H. Bennett. Macdonald still had to augment his small funds with private tutoring in general and medical subjects, and he established a reputation as a teacher. He also found time for running and walking, which he enjoyed. In his midwifery finals he was examined on accidental haemorrhage and abortion. He graduated MD in 1864. Once qualified, he began in practice in Edinburgh, and lectured in the extramural school and at the Royal Infirmary on materia medica, midwifery, and the diseases of women. He published a revision of Scoresby-Jackson's materia medica with a supplement containing the new preparations introduced into the British pharmacopoeia of 1867. Another book, <span class="italic">The Bearings of Chronic Heart Disease on Pregnancy</span>, was published in 1878.<br>
<br>In 1866 Macdonald married Annie Finlayson (1839&#150;1917), daughter of an Edinburgh Presbyterian minister, Thomas Finlayson, and Janet Carrick Chrystal. The couple lived at 41 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh, where Macdonald practised with increasing success as he concentrated more on obstetrics. He was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1865, and of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1869. As physician to the Royal Maternity Hospital he kept up assiduously with new developments in his subject. Operations for the removal of ovarian cysts and fibroid tumours of the uterus as well as extra-uterine pregnancy now became the mainstay of his practice, and some of his work showed a talent for bold innovation. His contributions to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical Journal</span> showed his development as a surgeon and his application to detail in the meticulous operations of which he became master. In 1882 the strain of overwork combined with a cold led to an attack of pleuropneumonia which forced him to stop work and to travel to the French riviera for warmth and rest.<br>
<br>Macdonald's career had been unusually prosperous. He had moved both his home and his consulting rooms to the fashionable Charlotte Square (while retaining the plain, approachable manner of the northern Scottish doctor), and he was now the father of seven children: Thomas Finlayson, Jessie Chrystal, Angus, Robert John, Margaret Bremner, George Andrew, and Ranald, the last born in 1881. On his return from France in 1882 Macdonald cut his workload, but the pulmonary trouble flared up again early in 1886. He died in Edinburgh on 10 February 1886, and was buried nearby in the Grange cemetery. His widow died in Edinburgh in 1917. Their eldest son, Thomas, became a doctor, but died in 1896 at the age of twenty-seven.<br>
<br>Macdonald's singular achievement was the remarkable advance he made in his chosen field in spite of early poverty and a late start in life. His writing, particularly in his papers for the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society, was noted for its clarity. He enhanced the reputation of the Edinburgh medical school, and greatly influenced the next generation of obstetricians.<br>
