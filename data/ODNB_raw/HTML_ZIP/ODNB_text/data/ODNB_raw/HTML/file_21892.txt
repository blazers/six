<span class="headword">Penrose,  Thomas</span>  (1742&#150;1779), <span class="occ">poet</span>, baptized at Newbury, Berkshire, on 9 September 1742, was the eldest son of Thomas Penrose (1715/16&#150;1769), rector of that parish. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 30 May 1759, aged sixteen. After 1762 he left the university and joined a private expedition, partly English and partly Portuguese, which was formed for the attack of Buenos Aires, under the command of an adventurer named Captain Macnamara. The party left the Tagus on 30 August 1762, and on its way attacked the settlement of Nova Colonia de Sacramento in the River Plate, which had been seized by the Spanish. Operations were at first successful; but the chief ship, the <i>Lord Clive</i>, caught fire, and Macnamara was drowned, with most of the crew. The second vessel, the <i>Ambuscade</i>, in which Penrose served as a lieutenant of marines, escaped, and ultimately arrived at the Portuguese settlement of Rio de Janeiro. Penrose had been wounded in the fight and, although he recovered from his wounds, the hardships of the next month in a prize sloop undermined his constitution. Very soon afterwards he returned to England, and again settled at Oxford, graduating BA from Hertford College on 8 February 1766. In 1768 Penrose married Mary, eldest daughter of Samuel Slocock of Newbury.<br>
<br>Penrose is described as possessing learning, eloquence, and good social qualities. His principal writings are mainly imitative of Collins and Gray; but several of his poems deal in a natural vein with his disappointments in life. A poetical essay, &#145;On the Contrarieties of Public Virtue&#146;, shows powers of irony and satire. His chief works were <span class="italic">Flights of Fancy</span> (1775), <span class="italic">Address to the Genius of Britain</span> (1775), a poem in blank verse proposing a limit to our &#145;civil dissensions&#146; and criticizing the conduct of the government towards America, and a posthumous volume of poems (1781) with a biographical introduction by James Pettit Andrews, who had married his sister Anne. His work was included in Anderson's <span class="italic">Complete Edition of the Poets</span> (vol. 11), Park's <span class="italic">British Poets</span> (vol. 33), Pratt's <span class="italic">Cabinet of Poetry</span> (vol. 5), and the Chiswick edition of <span class="italic">British Poets</span> (vol. 63); and several of his poems are in Bell's <span class="italic">Fugitive Poetry</span> (vols. 12 and 13). A poem by Penrose entitled &#145;Newberry Belles&#146;, signed &#145;P., Newbury, 8 May 1761&#146;, the characters in which are identified by Godwin, is in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of 1761 (pp. 231&#150;2), and two more of his poetical pieces are in the same periodical for 1799 (pt 2, pp. 1177&#150;8). Campbell included two of Penrose's pieces&#151;&#145;The Helmets&#146; and &#145;The Field of Battle&#146;&#151;in his <span class="italic">Specimens of the British Poets</span>.<br>
<br>Penrose took holy orders, and became curate to his father at Newbury. About 1777 he was appointed by a friend to the rectory of Beckington-cum-Standerwick, near Frome in Somerset; but his health failed. He died at Bristol on 20 April 1779, and was buried at Clifton, where a monument was erected in his memory.<br>
<br>Penrose's widow married at Newbury, in February 1786, the Revd Thomas Best, master of the free grammar school, and died about 1840, at the age of ninety-four. Penrose's only child, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1851), was admitted on the foundation of Winchester College, became fellow of New College, Oxford, and vicar of Writtle-cum-Roxwell. He wrote <span class="italic">Sketch of the Lives and Writings of Dante and Petrarch</span> (1790).<br>
