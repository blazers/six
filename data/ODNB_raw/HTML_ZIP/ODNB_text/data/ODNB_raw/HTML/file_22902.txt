<span class="headword">Purnell,  Robert</span>  (1606&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Baptist leader and author</span>, was born on 15 October 1606, probably in Bristol. He was a carpet weaver and freeman of the city, and lived with his wife in St James's Back; their son John (<i>d</i>. 1686) was an ironmonger in Maryport Street, Bristol.<br>
<br>Purnell was a member of the separatist Broadmead congregation, known as &#145;a Church of Christ&#146;, in Bristol from its inception in 1640. Baptism was first considered by the congregation when it migrated to All Hallows, London, in 1643 following the capture of Bristol by the royalists but was not formally adopted. &#145;I lost mine estate by siding with them [parliament]&#146;, commented Purnell in 1651, &#145;I was in a banished condition one hundred and forty miles from home, for the space of two full years&#146;  (<span class="italic">No Power but of God</span>, 166&#150;7). In a brief pamphlet, <span class="italic">Englands Remonstrance</span> (1649), which he later expanded, Purnell vigorously complains that parliament, with all the power in its own hands, neglected those who supported it and feathered their own nests.<br>
<br>Purnell's works, written between 1649 and 1663, confirm he came to a Baptist position only slowly. In 1649 he commended Baptists for performing &#145;a right ordinance to right subjects&#146;, their &#145;sin&#146; was &#145;idolizing it&#146;, but disagreed with those who made<blockquote>Baptisme a ground of your communion and so disorder what God hath ordered; for the ground of communion should arise first from that union you have with Christ your head; and secondly from that near relation you have to each other, as being one in the same Spirit.</blockquote>He believed a time would soon come when all Christians will be<blockquote>ashamed to own one another by their fleshly titles but look upon and love one another as Christians, members of the same body &hellip; [whose] love of each other shall arise from union in the Spirit. Against this church-state the gates of hell shall not prevail. (<span class="italic">Good Tydings for Sinners</span>, 57&#150;8)</blockquote>His books advocate religious toleration on the basis of a common love of Christ, and he shared Cromwell's dismay at parliament's desire to enforce religious uniformity. In 1653 Purnell, not yet a Baptist, considered contemporary disputes &#145;about the garment of religion&#146; while &#145;the power thereof is much abated&#146; futile: &#145;a true communion of saints according to the Gospel institution&#146; comes about when &#145;a saint comes to see that everyone in whom the Lord Jesus appeareth, is a member together with him in the same body whereof Christ is Head&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Way to Heaven Discovered</span>, sig. B4r, p. 156).<br>
<br>Purnell's move towards baptism was paralleled by developments in the Broadmead congregation. In 1651 the first questions about &#145;Sprinkleing of Children&#146; arose and the following year &#145;the Lord awakened some &hellip; to consider there was noe ground for Baptizing children, much less for Sprinkleing them&#146; and they joined &#145;the other Church in Bristol that were all Baptized&#146;  (Hayden, 103, 105). In 1653 a member of Broadmead, Thomas Cattle, was sent to London for baptism by the Baptist minister Henry Jessey, and in 1654 when Purnell, already a deacon, was elected &#145;Eldest Ruleing Elder&#146;, he also sought baptism from Jessey, having for sometime been &#145;convinced of his duty therein, but omitted ye practice thereof&#146;  (Hayden, 111, 122). By now, Broadmead had become an open communion baptized congregation.<br>
<br>Purnell advocated toleration between all Christian communities, pleading for a third way as advocated by Henry Jessey, John Bunyan, and others between particular and general baptist beliefs; and in his own congregation Purnell never allowed believers' baptism to create a barrier between Christians of a different persuasion. However, he faced the opposition of another founding member of Broadmead, Dennis Hollister, who had served as MP for Somerset in Cromwell's nominated parliament of 1653 and, while in London, had begun to espouse Quaker views. Hollister ridiculed the &#145;Baptized-Independent people&#146; of Broadmead for becoming &#145;imitators of water baptism &hellip; a practice disowned by those I joined&#146;  (Hollister, 2). Thomas Ewins, &#145;an open professed Dipper&#146;, spoke for Purnell and Broadmead when he claimed many supported him in administering the Lord's supper to all:<blockquote>though some of them mis-baptised, yet none of them deny the ordinance of Christ, onely some of them have not the light to see the right administration of it, but reckon that infant baptism is sufficient; yet as further light comes in, they are prepared to walk up to it, in the mean time we can bear with them in love, as we desire them and others to bear with us in other things. (Purnell and others, 59)</blockquote>However, Purnell found himself on the same side as Hollister in voting for John Haggatt, one of two unsuccessful Independent candidates who stood against presbyterian and royalist sympathisers in the controversial 1654 parliamentary election in the city.<br>
<br>By 1657 Purnell was asserting baptism was<blockquote>an ordinance of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> by the washing of water &hellip; representing the powerful washing of the blood of Christ &hellip; and so sealing our regeneration or new birth, and entrance into the covenant of grace, our grafting into Christ and into the Body of his Church. (<span class="italic">A Little Cabinet Richly Stored</span>, 255)</blockquote>But he still warned his co-religionists: &#145;You that have taken up this ordinance, beware of laying a greater stress upon it than ever God appointed you, viz, it was never appointed to break love and communion, and to quench the Spirit, and to jostle out some other ordinances, nor to shut out the weak in Faith&#146;  (ibid., 261).<br>
<br>Purnell published only one work, <span class="italic">A Serious Exhortation to an Holy Life, or Conversation</span> (1663), after the Restoration, and died in Bristol in November 1666.<br>
