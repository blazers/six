<span class="headword">Henry,  Augustine</span>  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">botanical collector and dendrologist</span>, was born on 2 July 1857 in Dundee, the first of six children of Bernard Henry (<i>c</i>.1825&#150;1891) and Mary MacNamee. His father, at one time a gold-prospector in California and Australia, was a native of the townland of Tyanee on the west bank of the River Bann in co. Londonderry. Soon after Austin (as Augustine was called within his family) was born, the family moved to Cookstown, co. Tyrone, where his father was in business as a flax dealer and owned a grocery shop.<br>
<br>Henry was educated at Cookstown Academy and in Queen's College, Galway. He studied natural sciences and philosophy, graduating with a first-class bachelor of arts degree and a gold medal in 1877. Henry then studied medicine at Queen's College, Belfast, where he obtained his master of arts degree in 1878. For a year he was in the London Hospital, and during a visit to Belfast in 1879, at the suggestion of one of his professors, he applied for a medical post in the Chinese imperial maritime customs service. Henry completed his medical studies as rapidly as he could, became a licentiate from the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh, passed the Chinese customs service examinations (for which he required a working knowledge of Chinese), and left for China in the summer of 1881.<br>
<br>Henry's first posting was in Shanghai, but in March 1882 he was assigned to Ichang (Yichang), a port on the Yangtze (Yangzi) River more than 900 miles inland in Hupeh (Hubei) province. There he served as the assistant medical officer and also performed customs duties. Bored by the routine of life within the small European community, Henry began collecting plants in the vicinity of Ichang in November 1884. Four months later he contacted the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, offering to collect specimens and seeking assistance with identification. As a result, Henry became one of the most important botanical collectors to have worked in central China, although he regarded this work as a hobby. He undertook two long field trips in the Hupeh&#150;Szechwan (Sichuan) region, and also paid native collectors for specimens. During the next four years he accumulated a vast collection of pressed, dried specimens; the first set is preserved at Kew. In April 1889 he was transferred to Hainan where he stayed four months.<br>
<br>At the end of a year's home leave, on 20 June 1891, Henry married Caroline Orridge (<i>c</i>.1860&#150;1894), daughter of a London jeweller, at St George's, Bloomsbury, London. They travelled to China, and were based in Shanghai before transferring to Taiwan. Henry wrote <span class="italic">Notes on Economic Botany of China</span> (1893) during this period. The tropical climate did not suit Caroline, who became progressively more ill with tuberculosis. She sought respite elsewhere, and in January 1894 left for Denver, Colorado, USA, where she died in September 1894; the couple had no children. A genus of tropical Chinese primroses was named <i>Carolinella</i> in her memory; because the few species are indistinguishable from <i>Primula</i> it is no longer regarded as distinct. After his wife's death, Henry decided to remain in China and was transferred to the isolated southern cities of Mengzi and thence Simao, where he continued his duties within the customs service as well as continuing to collect plants and to publish notes about the Chinese flora. He resigned and left for Europe on 31 December 1900.<br>
<br>By 1901 Henry was famous as a botanical collector; the Royal Horticultural Society of London recognized this by awarding him the Veitch memorial medal in 1902 and the Victoria medal of honour in 1906. He stayed in London from the spring of 1901 until the autumn of 1902, sorting his botanical collections at Kew. During this period he helped to finance the establishment by his friend Miss Evelyn Gleeson of a craft centre at Dun Emer in Dublin; this centre made a most important contribution to the Celtic revival. Henry gradually decided to make a career in forestry, and persuaded the Irish authorities to secure a place for him in the School of Forestry, Nancy, France. While Henry was studying there, Henry John Elwes (1846&#150;1922), a wealthy arboriculturist, asked him to collaborate on a monograph about trees cultivated in Ireland and Britain, so he left France and set to work visiting estates, plantations, and gardens throughout Britain and Ireland to record, identify, and measure trees. <span class="italic">Trees of Great Britain and Ireland</span> was printed privately by Elwes in seven volumes with an index volume between November 1906 and July 1913.<br>
<br>Early in 1907 Henry became reader in forestry at the University of Cambridge; he remained there until January 1913 when he became the first professor of forestry in the Royal College of Science, Dublin (later part of University College, Dublin). He retired in 1926 and died at his home, 5 Sandford Terrace, Clonskeagh, co. Dublin, on 23 March 1930. A lapsed Roman Catholic, Henry was buried with the rites of that church in Dean's Grange cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>Henry had married Alice Helen 
    (Elsie; 1882&#150;1956)
  , daughter of the physician Sir Lauder Brunton, on 17 March 1908; they had no children. Elsie Henry was herself a keen amateur botanist and dendrologist, and she organized her husband's herbarium of voucher specimens for <span class="italic">Trees of Great Britain and Ireland</span> and presented it to the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, along with some of his profusely annotated books. The Henrys had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances including the Yeats family, George Russell (pseudonym A. E.), and George Bernard Shaw and his wife.<br>
<br>As an expert with unequalled knowledge of the exotic trees cultivated in Ireland (and their performance in Irish conditions) Henry gave evidence to the committee of inquiry into Irish forestry established in 1907. He advocated commercially viable plantations of more than 500 acres, planted with conifers from the north-western coastal region of North America. This recommendation was largely accepted, and Henry is highly regarded as the &#145;father&#146; of Irish commercial forestry. There is a memorial stone at Avondale in co. Wicklow, and a memorial plaque in Portglenone Forest, co. Antrim.<br>
<br>Henry's accomplishments in China were recognized when a wing of the Fan Memorial Institute of Botany in Peking (Beijing) was named in his honour (although this no longer exists), and fascicle II of <span class="italic">Icones plantarum Sinicarum</span> was dedicated to him. An uncounted number of plants bear names that mark Henry's exploration of the Chinese flora; examples include <i>Acer henryi</i>, <i>Parthenocissus henryana</i>, and <i>Rhododendron augustinii</i>. Henry himself introduced an orange-blossomed lily, <i>Lilium henryi</i>, and of this plant, Ernest Wilson, Henry's successor as a botanical explorer in China, wrote: &#145;It is particularly fitting that such a notable addition to our gardens should bear the honoured name of a pioneer who has done so much to acquaint a sceptical world of the floral wealth of interior China&#146;  (Wilson, 80).<br>
