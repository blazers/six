<span class="headword">Murray <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Findlay]</span>,  Jane Elmslie Henderson <span class="st"> [Jean]</span></span>, Viscountess Dunedin  (1885&#150;1944), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 25 December 1885 at 50 Victoria Street, Aberdeen, the daughter of George Findlay, hat merchant, and his wife, Jane Elmslie Henderson. Both her parents were recorded as deceased on 11 January 1886, when her birth was registered, and nothing is known of her early life.<br>
<br>Jean Findlay first came to public notice as a contributor and translator associated with the journal <span class="italic">Everyman</span> in 1914. This began in 1912 as a literary review, and was being edited at the outbreak of the First World War by Dr Charles Sarolea, the Belgian consul in Edinburgh. At that time it concerned itself with fund-raising and publicity on behalf of Belgium, and Jean Findlay contributed to this. She acted as a war correspondent, reporting from Flanders, and for example, in 1916, on Belgian children as refugees in Switzerland. In 1915 she made a fund-raising lecture tour to Canada. Her translation <span class="italic">The Barbarians in Belgium</span> (1915), from the work by Pierre Nothomb, appeared in support of the cause. She also helped to start a YMCA for the Belgian army and was an honorary member of the Belgian government committee of propaganda. In recognition of the large sums that she helped to raise for Belgium and other services she was made a member of the order of Queen Elizabeth of Belgium.<br>
<br>From late 1916 until early 1917 Jean Findlay was acting editor of <span class="italic">Everyman</span>. After giving up this position she continued writing and in 1918 she published <span class="italic">Three Aspects of the Russian Revolution</span>, from the work by &Eacute;mile Vandervelde. In late 1916, at the suggestion of Baron Strathclyde, she became involved with the work of the savings movement in Scotland. Serving as the director of Scottish Savings from 1916 until 1923, she was a leading figure in various savings campaigns, which included wartime visits to British troops in France and public meetings throughout Scotland. Her abilities as a platform speaker were of great use in helping to build up this largely voluntary movement; in 1920 she was made a CBE in recognition of her efforts.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1923 Jean Findlay married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35154/', "Andrew Graham Murray (1849&#150;1942), first Baron Dunedin")</script>, lord of appeal-in-ordinary, at a ceremony in the private chapel of Lambeth Palace. They had no children. As the second Lady Dunedin she reportedly encouraged her husband to broaden his interests beyond the law and his existing recreations. Her striking good looks attracted comment until the end of her life  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 March 1944). In 1926, on her husband's elevation, she became the first Viscountess Dunedin.<br>
<br>Between December 1933 and September 1934 Viscountess Dunedin renewed her association with <span class="italic">Everyman</span>, this time as its editor. By her own account she returned as a result of a request to guide the paper back to stability and revive its coverage of varied interests. Her network of contacts was useful in providing a range of distinguished contributors who suited the readership.<br>
<br>In addition to those honours already mentioned Viscountess Dunedin was a lady of grace of St John of Jerusalem; she was also the first honorary secretary of the Scottish League of Nations Union. Her husband died in an Edinburgh nursing home in August 1942, after a long illness. She survived him by almost two years, dying of cancer at her home, 42 Lower Sloane Street, London, on 20 March 1944.<br>
