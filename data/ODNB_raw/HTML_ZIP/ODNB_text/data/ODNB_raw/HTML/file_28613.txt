<span class="headword">Walsh,  John Edward</span>  (1816&#150;1869), <span class="occ">judge and writer</span>, was born in Tolka, co. Dublin, on 12 November 1816, the son of Robert Walsh (1772&#150;1852) a cleric, and his wife, Ann Eliza Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of John Bayly. He received his early education at Bective School, co. Dublin, and matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 5 July 1832; he became a scholar in 1835 and graduated BA in 1837 with the first gold medal in both classics and ethics. In 1845 he was granted the honorary degree of LLD. He entered the Middle Temple, London, in 1838 and was called to the Irish bar in the Michaelmas term of 1839, upon which he joined the Leinster circuit. On 1 October 1841 he married Blair Belinda, the daughter of Captain Gordon MacNeill. They had five sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>During his early years at the bar Walsh contributed frequently to the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. He also edited several law books; one, which he published jointly with Richard Nun, <span class="italic">The Powers and Duties of Justices of the Peace in Ireland</span> (1844), became a standard textbook on the subject. In 1847 he also published, anonymously, <span class="italic">Ireland Sixty Years Ago</span>, a well-known book in its day, which offered a portrait of life and manners in Ireland during the Grattan parliament. Walsh was a reporter in the court of chancery from 1843 to 1852 and was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1855.<br>
<br>In 1857 Walsh became a queen's counsel, and, two years later, crown prosecutor at Green Street. A lifelong Conservative, he was in 1866 appointed attorney-general for Ireland in Lord Derby's third administration, and in the same year he was elected to represent the University of Dublin in parliament. Again in the same year he was raised to the Irish bench as master of the rolls, in succession to Thomas Barry Cusack-Smith. His most famous judgment was that in <i>MacCormac v. The Queen's University</i>, which invalidated the charter granted to the university in 1866 by Lord Russell's government. It was also during his tenure of office as master of the rolls that the Irish Public Record Office was reorganized under Sir Samuel Ferguson.<br>
<br>After the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, Walsh became an active member of the provisional convention for settling the new constitution of the church. His normal place of residence was Merrion Square, Dublin, but he died after a very short illness, in Paris, on 20 October 1869; he was survived by his wife.<br>
