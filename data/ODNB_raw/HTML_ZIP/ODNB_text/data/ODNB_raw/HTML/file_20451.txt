<span class="headword">&Oacute; Briain,  Donnchad  Cairprech</span> <span class="st"> [Donogh  Cairbrech O'Brien]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1242), <span class="occ">king of Thomond</span>, was one of three surviving sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20449/', "Domnall M&#243;r Ua Briain, king of Thomond (d. 1194)")</script>. It is not certain when Donnchad became king, but he appears to have emerged as the leading member of his turbulent family when King John knighted him in 1210. Longevity was not a notable feature of leadership in the Gaelic world, yet Donnchad successfully held his ground for more than thirty years in the face of internal strife and the wiles of his Irish and Norman foes. This was no mean achievement in circumstances where the Normans were triumphant everywhere along his borders.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Briain's early years were preoccupied with the struggles for the succession. His brother Muirchertach appears to have succeeded to the kingship in 1194, but almost immediately there was fraternal strife. A third brother, Conchobhar, emerged as the initial victor by capturing Donnchad in 1196, allying himself with the Normans in the following year, and seizing the kingship from Muirchertach in 1198. His triumph was short-lived, for in 1202 he was killed by his deposed brother's followers. Trouble broke out afresh in 1207, when Muirchertach, who had attacked Norman castles in northern Tipperary, was betrayed by Donnchad to the English of Limerick. He remained in captivity until his release in 1210.<br>
<br>Political ascendancy was reinforced by royal favour. King John knighted &Oacute; Briain at Waterford in 1210, and thereafter appears to have regarded him as a tenant-in-chief, holding land for an annual rent of 60 marks. He immediately awarded him the custody of William de Burgh's strategic castle of Carrigogunnell, near Limerick, possibly because &Oacute; Briain was married to William's daughter. It also suggests that John intended to use &Oacute; Briain to counter the ambitions of the Norman lords in north Munster. Nevertheless, he stopped short of recognizing him as king of Thomond: royal writs addressed to Donnchad during John's reign conspicuously avoided the title. Nor was &Oacute; Briain granted exclusive lordship of Thomond. The king retained three cantreds in Corcu Baiscinn and the cantred of Tradree, which he granted to the justiciar, John de Gray, who in turn granted them to Reginald of Finegal and Thomas fitz Adam. Muirchertach &Oacute; Briain seems to have been regarded in royal sources as a tenant-in-chief also, holding territory in Thomond by annual rent.<br>
<br>Donnchad &Oacute; Briain was careful to avoid direct conflict with either the crown or the great Norman lords. Only once did he incur royal disfavour, when in 1234 he made fine for having sided with William (II) Marshal. For this lapse he paid heavily when Thomond was ravaged by the justiciar in the following year. He allied himself with the Normans in raids on the Mac Carthaigh kingdom of Desmond in 1201, 1206, and 1214, while in 1225 and 1230 he was similarly involved in invasions of Connacht. His father had been no friend of the Mac Carthaighs, so the outlines of traditional rivalries are discernible behind such alliances. Much the same is probably true of &Oacute; Briain's interventions in Connacht in support of the sons of Cathal Croibhdhearg &Oacute; Conchobhair, whose wife, M&oacute;r (<i>d</i>. 1217/18) was Donnchad's sister. It was no doubt on the basis of his prosecution of traditional rivalries that &Oacute; Briain earned the approval of the chronicler in the annals of Inisfallen on his death in 1242: &#145;there was not during his time a better Munsterman, or one more affable, or of greater retinue, or better provided with victuals than he&#146;. According to Sir James Ware (<i>d</i>. 1666), Donnchad was buried in the Dominican convent, Limerick.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Briain was predeceased by his wife, Sadh (<i>d</i>. 1240), daughter of &Oacute; Cenn&eacute;tig. An earlier marriage to an unnamed daughter of William de Burgh is attested only by a comparatively late Gaelic source. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20444/', "Conchobhar &#211; Briain (d. 1268)")</script> succeeded him as king of Thomond. His remaining sons, Muirchertach and Tairdelbhach, died in 1242. His daughter Sadb, wife of Sefraid &Oacute; Donnchada, was killed in 1253.<br>
