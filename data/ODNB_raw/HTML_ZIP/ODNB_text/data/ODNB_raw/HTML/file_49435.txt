<span class="headword">Blashfield,  John Marriott</span>  (1811&#150;1882), <span class="occ">terracotta manufacturer</span>, was born on 1 November 1811 in the parish of St James, Westminster, one of at least two sons of John and Eleanor Blashfield. No further details are known of his background and his early life and education are similarly obscure. By 1841, and described as an artist, he was living at 1 Upper Stamford Street, Blackfriars, but he first comes to light two years earlier in 1839 laying a Venetian <i>pis&eacute;</i> (hard scagliola) floor at Deepdene in Surrey, the home of Henry Thomas Hope. Two years later he provided scagliola for Sir Charles Barry's Reform Club. At about that time he entered into partnership with the roman cement makers Wyatt, Parker &amp; Co., and as a result of this he is personally credited with supplying the finest cement for the final phase of the Thames Tunnel (1835&#150;42).<br>
<br>Blashfield had also been carrying out small scale terracotta experiments, but he was more interested in tessellated pavements, giving them as the reason for entering into the Wyatt Parker partnership. However, a patent taken out in 1840 by Richard Prosser of Birmingham, for making china buttons from hydraulically compressed dry clay, changed his line of thought. He saw in it possibilities for making mosaic tesserae, but unfortunately, Herbert Minton took a half share in Prosser's patent. This was a blow as from then on Blashfield had to use Minton's fired clay tesserae for his own work. In 1843 Blashfield and Minton jointly installed one of their earliest pavements in the Society of Arts at the Adelphi. Despite his dependence on Minton, Blashfield was given great credit by contemporaries for the development of tessellated pavements and for his associated work on encaustic tiles.<br>
<br>1843&#150;7 saw an unfortunate and financially disastrous period in Blashfield's life. He entered the field of building speculation and attempted to undertake a major part of the development of Kensington Palace Gardens in London. The commissioners of woods and forests (forerunners of the crown estate commissioners) were offering ninety-nine year leases to build thirty-three houses on part of the former kitchen gardens of Kensington Palace. Blashfield tendered for twenty of them, offering a total rent rising to almost &pound;2000 per annum. This was an extremely high rent and Blashfield made his first houses too large for their sites, and so he had difficulty in disposing of them. By 1847, with five houses under construction, he was in severe financial difficulty and was declared bankrupt on 14 May with losses estimated at over &pound;40,000. It is difficult to see how he recovered from this blow. He had been able to direct Wyatt Parker money towards his building speculation, but his bankruptcy caused him to surrender his interests in tessellated pavements and encaustic tiles to Herbert Minton. It is likely that he also handed over premises, as from 1848 onwards Minton's is recorded as occupying a former Wyatt Parker address.<br>
<br>Whatever the other effects of his bankruptcy, Blashfield was able to continue his cement and scagliola business and in 1851 felt able to expand his Millwall factory into terracotta manufacture. He had a good artistic and technical grounding for this and, additionally, he had been developing valuable contacts over the previous decade with prominent and rising architects, designers, and sculptors. He went to some pains to prove to his peers and the general public the quality of his work. The colossal figures he supplied in 1853 for the resited Crystal Palace at Sydenham included <span class="italic">Australia</span> by John Bell, which at 9 feet tall was the largest single piece of terracotta ever fired; also from this period survives a huge Triton fountain in the courtyard of the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford (based on Bernini). Blashfield's works, largely in the classical tradition, began to appear in numerous country house gardens and on several buildings in London: for example, Hampton Court, Kew Gardens, Marlborough House, the duchy of Cornwall office (10 Buckingham Gate), the Sheepshanks Gallery (Victoria and Albert Museum), Chelsea Bridge, and Woolwich barracks. His <span class="italic">Catalogue of 500 Articles</span> (1855) and published catalogues of 1857 and 1868 show the range of his work.<br>
<br>In December 1858 Blashfield moved from London to Stamford in Lincolnshire to be nearer a good source of clay and save money on wages. By this time he was married, but he and his wife, Isabella Mary Ann, had no children. They adopted as son their nephew, Joseph Joiner, who came to work for Blashfield in the Stamford pottery. On coming to Stamford, Blashfield was able to lease an almost new factory from the marquess of Exeter and his kilns were ready for firing by March 1859. It is a measure of Blashfield's success in London that the sale of stock on quitting his Millwall factory brought in undreamed-of prices; this story was repeated two years later when he moved his London showroom.<br>
<br>The 1860s were Blashfield's most successful years. By 1861 he was employing sixty-five workers and during the decade he received his major commissions. He was an innovative manufacturer and in 1860 patented a muffle kiln that set new standards in terracotta production. He supplied a number of large vases to Buckingham Palace in 1862 and terracotta for the Duke of Cornwall Hotel, Plymouth (1863&#150;5, architect, Charles Forster Hayward). Between 1865 and 1868 he received over &pound;4500 for balustrading, urns, and statuary in Matthew Digby Wyatt's major garden works at Castle Ashby near Northampton, but his largest commission was the new Dulwich College (1866&#150;70), designed by Charles Barry the younger. In 1870 he carried out further work for Digby Wyatt at Lady Alford's new house in Prince's Gate, London. Locally, he built facades for two Stamford buildings, and in 1871 constructed a large boathouse for the marquess of Exeter in Burghley Park. Blashfield also carried out much work abroad, including commissions in New Zealand and, by 1865, completion of the triumphal arch in the Victoria Gardens, Bombay (architects, Scott and McClelland). In the early 1870s he supplied terracotta for his most famous foreign building, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts (architects, Sturgis and Brigham, dem. <i>c</i>.1906). Illustrative of the sculptural work carried out at this time are twelve relief panels for the facade of the Wedgwood Institute, Burslem (1863&#150;9), depicting the processes in ceramics manufacture, and a large statue of Prince Albert (1865) for a hospital in Bishop's Waltham.<br>
<br>Though successful artistically, Blashfield showed a remarkable lack of business acumen. Through a series of uneconomic contracts and a lack of capital, he ran into difficulties. Things came to a head in 1872 when he had to turn his pottery into a limited liability company to finance his Boston museum contract. He had been working for over two years to achieve this and the contract was signed and the prospectus for the new company issued within weeks of each other in July. It was a pyrrhic success: the contract was also uneconomic and by 1875 Blashfield went into voluntary liquidation. There was another reason for his downfall. Despite Blashfield's criticisms of the earlier schools of terracotta, he was a part of them and relied on complex clay recipes and extensive retooling after moulding and drying. Varying clay mixes meant shrinkage rates were not constant, causing much wastage. There was also a reaction against the ultra-fine finish of these terracottas in favour of something slightly less refined and more vigorous. During the 1860s the balance between the old and new schools tipped in favour of the latter. The rougher-textured terracotta, straight from the mould, using only single fire clays and grog to control shrinkage rates, found much favour and produced a considerable economy. With fashion and economics against it, the old school was doomed. Two seminal meetings at the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1868, and published in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span> for 1867/8 and 1868/9, are a microcosm of the contemporary debate and centre on the work of Barry and Blashfield at Dulwich College.<br>
<br>Because Blashfield's personal finances became mixed with those of his company his American debts remained outstanding after the failure of the company. As a result he was declared bankrupt for a second time in 1877. He left Stamford in the same year, returning to London. There, over the next few years, he dealt in terracotta in what must have been a very small way. He died on 15 December 1882 at his home, 17 Great College Street, Westminster, leaving just &pound;52.<br>
<br>Blashfield was a strong-minded and resourceful entrepreneur, respected by his contemporaries. An 1871 photograph shows him to be a large man with receding hair and long half-beard. Though thwarted by circumstance in his original intention to produce tessellated pavements, he was highly successful in his second choice, terracotta. His importance lies in the link he provided between the eighteenth-century school of terracotta of Mrs Coade and the flourishing industry which developed from the 1870s to the 1930s. Blashfield was also indirectly responsible in part for its development in the United States; his nephew, adopted son, and works manager, Joseph Joiner, and senior foreman, James Taylor, both emigrated to the USA in the 1870s and became founding fathers of its terracotta industry.<br>
