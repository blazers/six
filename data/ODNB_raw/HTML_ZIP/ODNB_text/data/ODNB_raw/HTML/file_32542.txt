<span class="headword">Cook, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1860&#150;1947), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born on 7 December 1860 at Silverdale, near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, the eldest son of William Cooke, coalminer, and his wife, Margaret Fletcher. His childhood was spent in poverty and hard work. He first worked as a pit boy at the age of nine, and after his father died in 1873, he became the principal wage-earner of the family. Devoted to self-improvement, he studied during his lunch breaks and at night, developing the discipline, self-confidence, and endurance that were to last throughout his life. He became a lay preacher in the Primitive Methodist church and only his family obligations prevented his training for the ministry. Cook dropped the &#145;e&#146; from his surname and rejected gambling, alcohol, and tobacco, preferring to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson.<br>
<br>Cook was soon a passionate trade unionist, holding all the principal positions in his local miners' lodge by the age of twenty-three. He was an uncompromising advocate of his cause, and remained all his life a ruthless political debater with few skills in negotiation. On 8 August 1885 at the Wolstanton Primitive Methodist Chapel he married Mary, the schoolteacher daughter of George Turner, of Chesterton, Staffordshire. Her brother was one of several Silverdale miners who had migrated to the New South Wales coal town of Lithgow, west of Sydney. In December 1885 Cook departed for Lithgow, to be joined in January 1887 by his wife and baby son, the first of the six sons and three daughters of the marriage. He was soon involved in preaching and trade union activity, becoming a leading spokesman for the Lithgow miners. In June 1891 he entered the New South Wales legislative assembly representing the newly formed Labor Party and in October 1893 was elected leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party. The party was deeply divided, however, both over the tariff issue and over the willingness of the parliamentarians to accept the &#145;pledge&#146;, the commitment to vote together to follow policies determined by the party's extra-parliamentary conference. Although a protectionist in Silverdale and at first in Lithgow, Cook had been converted by the single-tax arguments of Henry George to free trade. He rejected the pledge and his rigidity in negotiation contributed to a disastrous split in the Labor Party. Cook was re-elected in 1894 as an independent Labor candidate, but soon afterwards accepted the offer of the post of postmaster-general in the Free Trade government led by George Reid, with an annual salary of &pound;1500. For decades afterwards, this decision led Cook to be seen by the Labor Party as the first of a long line of &#145;rats&#146;, who gained political and personal advantage by betraying Labor principles and the people who had put them into parliament. For his part, Cook was beginning his lifelong change from Labor to conservative, from working class to middle class, from republican to imperialist, from free trade back to protectionism, always with complete confidence in the correctness of his current position.<br>
<br>As postmaster-general and later as minister for mines and agriculture, Cook was energetic, adopting ideas such as putting postmen on bicycles and extending the telephone network. He appointed William Farrer to the position of government wheat experimentalist. His early views were reflected in his unsuccessful attempts to introduce local option for public house licences and to prevent lottery tickets being sent through the mail, but his support of retrenchment in the public service and balanced budgets reflected his new political alliance rather than his working-class upbringing. Above all, he loyally supported the more colourful Reid, under whose influence his abhorrence of tobacco was replaced by a taste for cigars.<br>
<br>A man of limited vision, Cook was initially reluctant to enter the new commonwealth parliament, but was persuaded to contest the seat of Parramatta, which included Lithgow and his former New South Wales electorate, for Reid's Free Trade Party in the first federal election in March 1901. He won easily, but spent most of the next several years in opposition, savagely attacking the Protectionist governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin. In the unstable politics of three-party competition, Cook became Reid's principal supporter in the move to unite the Protectionists and Free-Traders in an anti-socialist alliance. He was now uncompromisingly committed to defending the interests of the rich and successful. Having moved from Lithgow to the middle-class Sydney suburb of Marrickville in 1901, he moved again in 1908 to Baulkham Hills, the most exclusive part of his electorate. Cook had left the Primitive Methodists for the mainstream Methodists in 1902.<br>
<br>In 1905 Cook became deputy leader of the Free Trade Party and in 1908 succeeded Reid as leader. In 1909, despite Cook's rigidity in negotiations, a &#145;Fusion&#146; ministry united the non-Labor parties, with Deakin as prime minister and Cook as his loyal deputy and minister for defence. The government lasted less than a year, but saw Cook's most significant ministerial achievements. Closely following British advice, especially that given by Lord Kitchener, he laid down the basis for compulsory military training, established the Royal Military College, and agreed that the new Australian navy would be constituted to act as part of the empire's Pacific Fleet, rather than comprising coastal vessels as Labor preferred. He took firm decisions to start or to expedite munitions factories (including the small arms factory at Lithgow), initiated contracts for military supplies, and even offered a prize for the design of a fighter plane.<br>
<br>In 1910 Labor defeated the Fusion ministry in a landslide. As Deakin's deputy in the leadership of what was now called the Liberal Party, Cook vehemently denounced the Labor Party and its works. In January 1913 Deakin unexpectedly resigned and Cook was elected leader by twenty votes to nineteen over Sir John Forrest. In elections in May, the Liberals won a narrow majority in the house of representatives, while Labor retained control of the senate. Cook thus became prime minister, in office but not in power. His principal achievement was tactical, creating the circumstances to permit a double dissolution to resolve the conflict between the two houses. To widespread surprise, Labor won the subsequent election in September 1914, with majorities in both houses.<br>
<br>The European crisis and outbreak of the First World War came during the election campaign. Cook, always more concerned with domestic than imperial or international politics, was slow to respond, and the governor-general, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, had to initiate Australian mobilization. Cook pledged full support for Britain, transferring control of the Royal Australian Navy to the Admiralty and offering a contingent of 20,000 troops. In opposition once more, he supported the Labor government's war policies, but soon felt the need to introduce conscription. This view was supported by the new Labor prime minister, W. M. Hughes, but only a minority of his party. After defeat in a national referendum in 1916, Hughes and his followers left the Labor Party to form a minority government. In 1917 they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Outmanoeuvred in negotiation, Cook was relegated to minister for the navy while Hughes remained prime minister, although his former Labor supporters were outnumbered by the Liberals. After the 1917 election, the two elements merged to form the Nationalist Party. Once more, Cook served as loyal deputy to a more skilful and quick-witted leader.<br>
<br>In 1918 Cook accompanied Hughes to London for the Imperial Conference, but only attended the powerless war conference while Hughes represented Australia in the more significant war cabinet. Cook's self-esteem was assuaged by the award of the GCMG and a busy social round. The following year Cook supported Hughes at Versailles, but again he was usually relegated to relatively unimportant discussions, apart from sitting on the commission which drew the boundaries for Czechoslovakia, where he dutifully followed Foreign Office advice. In 1920&#150;21 Cook was treasurer in the Nationalist government, applying strictly conservative approaches to the difficult problems of inflation, unemployment, and low wages. He was rewarded with a five-year term as high commissioner in London, a position he thoroughly enjoyed. He promoted migration to and investment in Australia and established good relations with the higher strata of London society, including the king, to whom, with his sharply pointed beard, he bore a passing resemblance; but the prime minister, S. M. Bruce, created a separate channel for Anglo-Australian communications on important political matters. Cook's wife was appointed DBE in 1925 for her services to the Red Cross Society. After his return to Australia in 1927, Cook was chairman of a royal commission into the finances of South Australia, but otherwise left public life. He built a large block of flats in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Bellevue Hill, at Trahlee Road, living in one, Silchester, until his death there on 30 July 1947. He was survived by his wife, five sons, and three daughters. He was cremated in Sydney after a state funeral.<br>
