<span class="headword">Tooke,  George</span>  (1595&#150;1675), <span class="occ">army officer and writer</span>, was the fifth son of Walter Tooke (<i>d</i>. 1609), administrator, and his wife, Angelette (<i>d</i>. 1598), second daughter and coheir of William Woodliffe, citizen and mercer of London. He was the grandson of William Tooke, auditor-general of the court of wards and liveries for forty-four years until his death in 1588, an office which his father, Walter, inherited. There are memorials to Angelette Woodliffe, Walter Tooke, and to their eight sons and two daughters at St Lawrence's Church, Wormley, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>In 1625 Tooke took part in the unsuccessful expedition against Cadiz, led by Sir Edward Cecil, commanding a company of eighty volunteers. Tooke's own account, <span class="italic">The History of Cales Passion</span>, written in prose and verse, appears not to have been published until 1652, with new editions in 1654 and 1659. Detailing the shortcomings of logistical preparations prior to the expedition, Tooke wrote &#145;lest After-ages might unhappily wander into the same gravily way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cales Passion</span>, &#145;To the reader&#146;), and did not shrink from acknowledging the errors nor pass over the unfortunate exigencies which all helped contribute to the adventure's miserable outcome. Tooke's role in the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle merits no mention in the official relation written by John Glanville, Cecil's secretary, and he seems to have taken greatest pride in having brought his men home without loss.<br>
<br>A lengthy illness, contracted during the expedition's return, put paid to Tooke's own active military career. He took up residence on the family estate of Popes, at Essenden, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and there enjoyed the illustrious company of John Selden and John Hales. Tooke succeeded to the estate on the death of his eldest brother, Ralph, on 22 December 1635. That year he published his <span class="italic">Legend of Brita-Mart: otherwise Britaines Mars</span>, dedicated to his Hertfordshire neighbour, William, second earl of Salisbury, kinsman of the English commander at Cadiz in 1625. In the dedicatory epistle Tooke addressed Salisbury, remarking that &#145;the manage of a reall war is now familiarly every mans tract; the premises unconsulted, and our provisionall musters and militia still left at large, without any paraphrase&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Legend</span>, A3). The tract was written in the form of a conversation between three characters, Publicola, Infortunio, and Epimetheus, on the subject of England's military defences. The argument was first that it was mistaken to rely on either the kingdom's natural defences, or its military establishments overseas in Ireland and on the continent; and second that the ancient system of trained bands was in serious need of reform. In an extended passage Infortunio defended the emergence of that controversial figure in Caroline military reform, the county muster-master. The whole reads very much as a justification of Charles I's ambitious design to establish a &#145;perfect militia&#146;. The tract was published a second time in 1646, this time offering &#145;a paraphrase upon our provisionall British discipline. Inditing it of many severall distempers and prescribing to[o] the cure&#146;, and with the conversants renamed &#145;Mickle-Worth the Patriot, Peny-Wise the Worldling, and Mille-Toyle the Souldier&#146;  (title-page).<br>
<br>Tooke also composed eulogies to some of the heroes of early modern protestant internationalism. In 1647 he published <span class="italic">The Eagle Trussers Elegie</span>, an encomium on the career of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden which he dedicated to Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, as well as a eulogy to Captain (or Major) William Fairfax, slain at Frankenthal in the Palatinate in 1621. Tooke also ventured some thoughts on Dutch history, in his <span class="italic">Chronological revise, of those three successive princes of Holland, Zeland and Freisland, Floris the fourth, his sonne William king of the Romans, and Floris the fifth</span> (1647), dedicated to Charles Fairfax. Verses written on John, Lord Harrington, baron of Exton, keeper of the household of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I, were also published in 1647. Rounding off an extremely fruitful year Tooke then published a volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Annoe-dicata, or, A miscelanie of some different cansonets, dedicated to the memory of my deceased very deere wife</span> (1647). Anne, or Anna, Tooke (<i>bap</i>. 1615, <i>d</i>. 1642) was the daughter of Thomas Tooke of Bere Court in Kent, a distant relation of the Tookes of Hertfordshire. It is not known when she and George Tooke married. Anne died on 9 December 1642 and was buried at St Lawrence's, Wormley. Tooke's second wife was Margery, daughter of Thomas Coningsbry of North Mimms, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Although Tooke lived for many more years little else is known of him. His allegiance during the civil war is difficult to ascertain, as he was neither appointed to administrative office by parliament nor punished for delinquency. Most of the historical works of 1647 found their way back into print in 1659 or 1660. Tooke died without issue at Popes in 1675. He has not inspired as a writer. Both his prose and his poetry are undoubtedly impaired by a love of far-fetched metaphor and obscured by a painfully involved style, though some have claimed that he has been unduly disparaged.<br>
