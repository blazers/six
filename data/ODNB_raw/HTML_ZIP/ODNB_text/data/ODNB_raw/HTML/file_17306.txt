<span class="headword">Lyttelton,  George</span>, first Baron Lyttelton  (1709&#150;1773), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet (1685&#150;1751), landowner and politician, of Hagley, Worcestershire, and his wife, Christian (1688&#150;1759), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27118/', "Sir Richard Temple (1634&#150;1697)")</script> and the sister of Richard Temple, first Viscount Cobham (1675&#150;1749). He was born on 17 January 1709, probably two months premature, and baptized the same day at St James's, Westminster. He remained frail in appearance throughout his adult life&#151;his tall, thin frame, pale face, and lanky gait frequently caricatured by political satirists. Lyttelton was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 11 February 1726, but did not take a degree. He was a talented scholar with strong literary ambitions, whose first poem, <span class="italic">Blenheim</span>, a patriotic paean to the Churchill family, was published in March 1728, about the time he departed for the grand tour. While in Italy, Lyttelton wrote the outspoken poem <span class="italic">An Epistle to Mr Pope, from a Young Gentleman at Rome</span> (published 1730), prompted by the recent appearance of Pope's <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>. Lyttelton depicts Virgil's ghost reprimanding Pope for wasting his talents on &#145;meaner satire&#146;: instead, he should aspire to epic verse and &#145;join the PATRIOT's to the POET's praise&#146;  (Lyttelton, <span class="italic">Epistle</span>, 5&#150;6).<h2>
<a name="Lytteltonandthepatriotopposition"></a>Lyttelton and the patriot opposition</h2>Patriotism and poetry were the twin themes which came to dominate and define Lyttelton's own life. The most significant single event in his early political career was Robert Walpole's dismissal in 1733 of his uncle Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, from both his ministerial place and his regiment, part of a government purge meted out on former whig stalwarts who had criticized the ministry for suppressing an investigation into the affairs of the South Sea Company. Cobham retired to his family seat at Stowe in Buckinghamshire and built up a formidable array of opposition support among his cohort of young nephews, using his vast wealth to secure some of them parliamentary seats. Lyttelton may have assisted his father, a loyal Walpole whig, in the campaign that same year to defend Walpole's <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span>, but by 1735 he had been won over to his uncle's politics, though his father did not (as the press reported) threaten to disinherit him as a result. At a by-election in 1735 Lyttelton was returned for the Pitt family borough, Okehampton in Devon, joining his cousin Thomas Pitt in representing the town. This political group, which included Lyttelton, Thomas Pitt, William Pitt, and Richard Grenville and George Grenville (&#145;the cousinhood&#146;), as well as Viscount Cornbury and William Murray, were known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93706', "Cobham's Cubs")</script> or the Boy Patriots (all were under thirty in 1735). A new force on the political scene, they attracted praise for their apparently disinterested patriotism as well as ridicule for the Ciceronian rhetoric which distinguished their political speeches. In April 1736 Lyttelton, Pitt, and Richard Grenville provoked controversy with their daring attacks on George II and Walpole in speeches congratulating Frederick, prince of Wales, on his marriage to Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Lyttelton had first been introduced to Frederick in 1732 by Bubb Dodington, and he soon became a close confidant. In 1735 Lyttelton was appointed Frederick's equerry and in 1737 his secretary, promotions widely read as a public declaration of the prince's affiliation with the opposition.<br>
<br>The friction between the Cobham circle and the group of opposition whigs led by Pulteney and Carteret emerged in rivalry over management of Frederick: it was Lyttelton who warned the prince that Pulteney's parliamentary motion pressing for an increase in the prince's civil-list allowance would damage his popularity. The motion, which Lyttelton in the event supported, was defeated in February 1737. When in late 1737 Frederick finally broke with his parents and established his separate &#145;court&#146; in Norfolk House, a centre of opposition activity, he came to rely increasingly on Lyttelton for advice: he was, in Pope's words:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">the Man, so near<br>
</div>
<div>His Prince, that writes in Verse, and has his Ear.<br>
</div> (A. Pope, <span class="italic">Epilogue to the Satires</span>, 1.45&#150;6)</blockquote>Lyttelton shared Frederick's cultural interests and was widely perceived as the &#145;Maecenas&#146; who brought deserving poets to his royal notice. In practice only a handful of poets&#151;Richard Glover, James Thomson, and David Mallet&#151;received financial reward, but Lyttelton undoubtedly helped use Frederick's influence to inspire and mobilize a campaign of patriot writing in the late 1730s. On 14 April 1737 the ministerial <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span> satirized him as Littledone, a troublemaker who has urged the playwrights of his acquaintance to &#145;put into their Plays all the strong things they can think of against Courts and Ministers, and Places and Pensions&#146;. Lyttelton's extravagant puff in the opposition journal <span class="italic">Common Sense</span> for Glover's patriot epic <span class="italic">Leonidas</span> was clearly designed as a hit against the ministry, as well as to incite Pope (whose poetry is compared unfavourably to Glover's) to turn his pen to loftier themes.<br>
<br>The relationship between Pope and Lyttelton was complex and significant, hinging on shared literary and aesthetic interests. Their extensive correspondence in the period between 1738 and 1741 reveals Lyttelton's efforts to persuade Pope to produce his own &#145;Moral Song&#146; for the nation, and to act as moral and literary supporter to the prince, to be &#145;as much with him as you can, Animate him to Virtue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.138). Lyttelton came the closest to achieving this aim during 1738, the year in which Pope was heavily involved with the patriots, editing their stage plays and becoming involved in details of the new broad-bottom coalition within the opposition. Pope twice compliments Lyttelton by name in his two dialogues of the <span class="italic">Epilogue to the Satires</span> of that year. It is perhaps significant that, even after Pope's disillusionment with patriot politics set about 1740, Lyttelton's name is absent from Pope's unpublished satiric fragment &#145;One Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty&#146; indicting other members of the group.<br>
<br>As a writer himself Lyttelton contributed substantially to the opposition campaign. Although he began his published career as a poet, his &#145;Observations on the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth&#146;, written in 1733 but never published (Hagley MSS), reveals the impact of Bolingbroke's recent <span class="italic">Remarks on the History of England</span> in its concern with the politics of Elizabeth's reign. The essay, an imagined conversation between Walter Ralegh, Henry Wotton, and Sir Francis Bacon, is rich in historical parallels with the Walpole era. Two years later Lyttelton's <span class="italic">Letters from a Persian in England to his Friend at Ispahan</span> (1735), a series of fictional letters commenting on the manners and mores of Walpolian England, made a significant impact on the literary-political world. Their lively, humorous style coupled with their pointed attacks on the government made them one of the most widely read opposition works, and they went through several editions within the space of a year. Lyttelton also contributed to one of the most important opposition journals, <span class="italic">Common Sense, or, The Englishman's Journal</span>, started in February 1737 after the demise of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, taking up that journal's campaign for a unified country opposition. In 1739 he also published, anonymously, <span class="italic">Considerations upon the Present State of our Affairs at Home and Abroad</span>, one of many warmongering pamphlets of that year, which echoed his own parliamentary speech of February 1739 attacking the convention with Spain.<h2>
<a name="ThefallofWalpoleandthemiddleyears"></a>The fall of Walpole and the middle years</h2>In the general election of May 1741 Lyttelton unsuccessfully challenged his tory rival Edmund Lechmere for a seat after an attempt by opposition whigs and tories to share the representation of the two Worcestershire seats had broken down. This quarrel occasioned Sir Charles Hanbury Williams's <span class="italic">Political Eclogue</span>, a much-cited political satire with a famous caricature of a lofty Lyttelton inappropriately citing Roman precedent to the blunt squire Lechmere. Three months earlier the disunity which dogged opposition attempts to oust Walpole had made itself apparent in Samuel Sandys's unsuccessful motion of 13 February 1741, supported by Lyttelton, to remove Walpole &#145;from the king's counsels and presence for ever&#146;. The subsequent satirical print series <span class="italic">The Motion</span> shows various opposition leaders, including Pulteney, Marchmont, and the unmistakably emaciated figure of Lyttelton, lagging behind a Whitehall-bound stagecoach exclaiming, &#145;Lost it!&#146;, or, &#145;Oh, my place!&#146;. Walpole was forced to resign office in February 1742. Cobham's cohorts were excluded from the new Pulteneyite administration drawn up in March. Pulteney's later justification for his own desertion of patriotism included the accusation that Lyttelton, Pitt, and the Grenvilles had also entered negotiations with the ministry before February, a charge substantiated by the Ayscough diaries, which showed that Lyttelton, acting with Frederick's approval, had (unsuccessfully) negotiated Walpole's &#145;Security and Protection&#146; from impeachment in return for ministerial places.<br>
<br>After Walpole's fall Lyttelton and Pitt remained in the reconstructed broad-bottom opposition, retaining an ambiguous position as members of the household of Frederick, who had become reconciled with his father and the new Pulteney administration. During the next two years Pitt effectively displaced Lyttelton as leader of the Cobham circle: certainly Lyttelton shared little of Pitt's violent anti-Hanoverianism. After the death of Wilmington, Lyttelton was one of a junto of nine then controlling opposition policy who favoured a coalition with the Pelhams to overthrow Carteret. On Carteret's downfall, Lyttelton was appointed a lord of the Treasury in the new broad-bottom administration in December 1744 and was subsequently dismissed from Frederick's household. With the rest of the group he joined Pitt, who was still out of place, in harassing the government: but on Pitt's admission to office in February 1746 he once again became a staunch defender of the administration.<br>
<br>When his former master Prince Frederick launched the new <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96922', "Leicester House")</script> opposition in 1747, Lyttelton, now a staunch ministerialist, was deeply embarrassed by the publication of Bolingbroke's <span class="italic">The Idea of a Patriot King</span>, an untimely reminder of his former patriot allegiances, and refused Bolingbroke permission publicly to dedicate the work to him, as it had been in its manuscript form in 1738: &#145;Mr Lyttelton sent him word, that he begged nothing might be inscribed to him that was to reflect on Lord Orford, for that he was now leagued with all Lord Orford's friends&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.59). In fact in 1747 Lyttelton himself redeployed for ministerial purposes the same broad-bottom tactics as the new Leicester House opposition in a rival bid to gain tory support for the ministry. In the anonymously published pamphlet <span class="italic">A Letter to the Tories</span> (1747), he posed as a non-Jacobite tory in order to exhort the tories to an alliance with the ministerial whigs. His disguise was soon seen through in Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Three Letters to the Whigs, Occasion'd by the Letter to the Tories</span> (1748), but his friend the writer Edward Moore defended him from this attack in <span class="italic">The Trial of Selim the Persian for Divers High Crimes and Misdemeanours</span> (also 1748). In the months before Frederick's death in 1751 it appears that Lyttelton, Pitt, and others from the cousinhood had attempted to renew their connections with him: according to Horace Walpole, rumour circulated that after Frederick's death Lyttelton had written a letter to his father lamenting the loss of this new arrangement and that the letter had inadvertently fallen into the wrong hands and been drawn to George II's attention. Egmont noted that no one knew how far this negotiation had really proceeded except the prince, and &#145;the secret is buried with him in his grave&#146;  (Sedgwick, 1.60).<br>
<br>On the death of his father in September 1751 Lyttelton succeeded to the baronetcy and took over the running of Hagley Hall. In political terms the most significant event of the 1750s was the rift which occurred between himself and other members of the cousinhood, a quarrel which was to last for several years. On Henry Pelham's death in March 1754 Lyttelton resigned his seat on the Treasury board and accepted the post of cofferer in the duke of Newcastle's administration. He refused to join Pitt in opposing Newcastle after the other cousins were turned out, but in November 1755 &#145;on the contrary was made Chancellor of the Exchequer in the room of Legge, which was resented with the greatest acrimony by the whole Cousinhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches of &hellip; Waldegrave</span>, 174). Lyttelton was widely regarded as being personally unsuited to the role of chancellor, lacking the financial acuity to master the office. When Newcastle resigned in November 1756 in the face of popular opposition, Lyttelton retired from office, and on 18 November 1756 he was created Baron Lyttelton of Frankley.<h2>
<a name="Hagleymarriagesandpersonallife"></a>Hagley, marriages, and personal life</h2>In his personal life during these years Lyttelton experienced the extremes of brief happiness and prolonged unhappiness. Numerous accounts suggest that his personal manner, perhaps as a consequence of shyness, could be awkward and aloof, particularly in his dealings with women. He was fortunate in his first marriage, on 15 June 1742, to Lucy Fortescue (1717/18&#150;1747), the 24-year-old daughter of Hugh Fortescue of Filleigh, Devon, and his wife, Lucy Aylmer. Lyttelton was devoted to her, and Thomson depicts him and his &#145;lov'd Lucinda&#146; as a latter-day Adam and Eve in the Edenic setting of Hagley in a passage added to <span class="italic">Spring</span> (1744). The marriage produced three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17310/', "Thomas Lyttelton (1744&#150;1779)")</script>, Lucy, and Mary. His wife's early death, on 19 January 1747 at the age of twenty-nine, while giving birth to Mary, was a tremendous blow. Lyttelton's <span class="italic">Monody</span> to her (probably his most famous poem, later parodied by Smollett) has a simple directness which transcends its literary conventionality. Lyttelton's remarriage two years later, on 10 August 1749, to Elizabeth (1716&#150;1795), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23496/', "Sir Robert Rich, fourth baronet (1685&#150;1768)")</script>, and Elizabeth Griffith, proved a mistake. There seems to have been little warmth between them. The children from his first marriage went to live with their grandmother at Ebrington in Gloucestershire. Lyttelton would arrange for his daughter Lucy to spend time with him at Radway, the home of his friend the architect Sanderson Miller, but her stepmother was never of the party. The marriage became acutely strained in 1756 when &#145;scandalous reports&#146;  (Dickins and Stanton, 346) circulated widely about her affair with George Durant. It reached a crisis in the spring of 1759 when, according to Lyttelton, she made herself the &#145;talk of the town&#146;  (Wyndham, 2.279&#150;80) by writing love letters to an Italian opera singer, Signor Tenduchi, an episode which led to Lyttelton's formal separation from his wife after granting her a separate maintenance equal to her jointure. Yet there were also other consolations during these years. One of these was spiritual. As a young man Lyttelton may well have imbibed some of his uncle Cobham's anti-clericalism, if not atheism. But in 1747 he emerged as a devout Christian, producing, under the influence of his cousin the poet and cleric Gilbert West, his <span class="italic">Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St Paul</span>, a work to which, Dr Johnson conceded, &#145;infidelity has never been able to fabricate a specious answer&#146;  (Johnson, 3.450).<br>
<br>Long before he inherited Hagley Hall from his father in 1751, Lyttelton had embarked on the ambitious gardening programme which would make Hagley Park one of the most admired landscape gardens of the eighteenth century. Work was well in hand by July 1739, when Pope made his first visit, and by 1745 he had created a place which rivalled his uncle Cobham's estate at Stowe and was recognized as a distinct advance in garden art. The park enjoyed a spectacular natural situation, and was &#145;improved&#146; by Lyttelton, who was in part inspired by Pope's ideas. It acquired an Ionic rotunda, a Palladian bridge, a grotto, and a hermitage; on Whichbury Hill within the park the ruins of a Roman camp were &#145;cut out into ridings &hellip; [to afford] many romantic and beautiful scenes&#146;  (Brownell, 223). In 1748 Sanderson Miller, doyen of the Gothic, supplied a &#145;ruined&#146; quasi-medieval tower for the grounds. But the new Hagley Hall designed by Miller and erected between 1756 and 1760 was designed in the fashionable Palladian style, plans for a Gothic building having been rejected. Lyttelton's interest during these years in &#145;romantick&#146; landscapes pervades his <span class="italic">Account of a Journey into Wales</span>, written in 1756 though not printed until 1774, one of the earliest Romantic tourist accounts of Wales, containing a notable description of Mount Snowdon's sublimity.<h2>
<a name="Lytteltonasfriendandpatron"></a>Lyttelton as friend and patron</h2>Lyttelton's historical significance derives as much, if not more, from his extensive activities as a friend and patron of writers as it does from his political career. Although in the late 1730s some of these activities were driven by a political agenda, Lyttelton was also capable of a more disinterested patronage. He genuinely enjoyed the company of writers and took pleasure in involving himself in their literary careers. His friendship with Pope transcended party politics, as did his friendship with James Thomson. Thomson was a frequent visitor at Hagley. It was here that he revised <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> in the summer of 1743. The interleaved copy of the first volume of his 1738 <span class="italic">Works</span>, on which Thomson wrote his revisions, also contains many revisions in Lyttelton's own hand. Lyttelton, in his posthumous edition of Thomson's poems, was responsible for revising and shortening <span class="italic">Liberty</span> (1735&#150;6), imbuing its patriotism with a slightly more optimistic slant, as befitted a then supporter of the ministry. It was Lyttelton who arranged the posthumous performance of Thomson's tragedy <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> at Covent Garden in January 1749 for his family's benefit. Thomson included an affectionate tribute to Lyttelton in his <span class="italic">Castle of Indolence</span> (1748), &#145;serene yet warm, humane yet firm his mind&#146;, a man whose active nature made him a reluctant inhabitant of Thomson's palace of pleasure.<br>
<br>Lyttelton's friendship with the dramatist and novelist Henry Fielding dated from their schooldays at Eton. The verse epistle that Fielding composed about 1731&#150;2 defending his cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu from Pope's recent attack on her was dedicated to Lyttelton. It has been argued by Thomas Cleary that Fielding's political sympathies closely followed those of Lyttelton and other members of the cousinhood, both in and out of government. It was to Lyttelton that Fielding dedicated <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1749), a novel which he had read in manuscript and had done much to promote. It has been suggested that Lyttelton, sometimes known as the Good Lord Lyttelton (in recognition of his moral character, but partly to distinguish him from his reprobate son the &#145;wicked&#146; Lord Lyttelton), may have helped inspire <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span>'s Squire Allworthy. Other literary friends were Richard Glover, David Mallet, the love poet James Hammond, William Shenstone, who engraved a tribute to him at The Leasowes, Edward Moore (whom he helped to found the paper <span class="italic">The World</span> in 1753), and Voltaire, with whom he corresponded. Yet Lyttelton probably received sharper and more lasting criticism from his role as literary patron than he did from his years as an opposition MP. From the early portrait of the propaganda master Littledone in the late 1730s, to the attacks on him for using his herd of &#145;placemen and pensionaries&#146; to tout <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> in the coffee houses, through to Smollett's cruel caricature in <span class="italic">Peregrine Pickle</span> (1751) of the na&iuml;ve but vain Sir Gosling Scragg, fed with the &#145;soft pap of dedication&#146;, Lyttelton was accused of using his wealth to gratify his vanity and unfairly sway literary opinion. Other writers, notably Lord Hervey and especially Horace Walpole, delighted in ridiculing his unco-ordinated movements, ungainly appearance, and general air of unworldliness.<h2>
<a name="Lateyears"></a>Late years</h2>Upon his accession to the House of Lords in November 1756 Lyttelton continued to play a vigorous role in political debate, but during the years of political controversy and instability which marked the eight successive ministries between 1757 and 1770 he declined to take office when offered to him, preferring a back-seat role. His rift with the Pitt&#150;Grenville cousinhood lasted for at least eight years. During the debates on the Prussian treaty and the bill for the extension of habeas corpus in 1758 Lyttelton was violently attacked by Temple: both peers were compelled by the house to agree not to take the matter any further. Horace Walpole reported in April 1764 that Lyttelton, Pitt, and Temple had once again become reconciled: that year they attempted to form a party against Lord Bute, and Lyttelton spoke on 30 April 1765 in a debate on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> arguing that the regent should be nominated by the king in conjunction with parliament in an effort to curtail Bute's influence. During the efforts to create a new administration in the summer of 1765 Lyttelton refused the offer of the Treasury made by the duke of Cumberland, George III's uncle and intermediary and Pitt's old enemy. Lyttelton once again remained loyal to the cousinhood when he refused Cumberland's offer of a cabinet seat in the new Rockingham administration. He was one of the few peers to protest Rockingham's repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1766, an unpopular stance &#145;delivering down an attestation of their tyrannic principles to posterity&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 22.410)&#151;incompatible, some thought, with the libertarian principles of Lyttelton's former patriot youth. When it was widely rumoured in September 1767 that Pitt was about to resign, Lyttelton sent Grenville, one of the chief contenders for office, plans for an unlikely coalition ministry between the Grenvillians, Rockinghams, and Bedfords, with himself as &#145;cabinet councillor extraordinary&#146;. In his last years he joined in the cousinhood's support for Wilkes, in January 1770 openly condemning the proceedings of the Commons against him.<br>
<br>Much of the energy that Lyttelton had directed at politics in his early years was in his later years channelled into his writing&#151;two large projects in particular, the <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span>, first published anonymously in 1760, and the <span class="italic">History of the Life of Henry the Second</span>, finally published in 1767. The <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span>, three of which, nos. 26&#150;8, were written by the bluestocking writer Elizabeth Montagu, with whom Lyttelton forged a close friendship in his later years, were very well received, going through three editions within three months, the first selling out on the day it appeared, 17 May. Lyttelton published four more new dialogues in 1765, which were added to the rest in a fourth edition that year. The dialogues were frequently reprinted in periodicals and anthologies. Subsequent criticism has been less favourable, much in the vein of Horace Walpole's scathing inversion &#145;<i>Dead</i> dialogues&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.407). Certainly Lyttelton's <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> lack the humour and playfulness of their Lucianic model: the dialogue between Addison and Swift in particular betrays Lyttelton's dislike of satire. Many of the dialogues deal with politics ancient and modern, and here Lyttelton is cautious to avoid offence, offering a balanced moderation between speakers which can seem bland. The most thought-provoking is perhaps that between William Penn and Cortez, a dialogue which seems to undermine the hollowness of Penn's piety and which gives the last word to Cortez. The <span class="italic">History of the Life of Henry the Second</span> was Lyttelton's labour of love, a work on which he was engaged intermittently over a period of some thirty years. Lyttelton first mentioned it in a letter to Pope of 13 June 1741, then intending it as a &#145;Work of some Instruction and Pleasure to my Countrymen, and I hope to the Prince my Master, for whose service I chiefly design it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.348). Frederick was long since dead when the first two volumes and an unnumbered volume of notes were published in 1767, the third volume with notes in December 1771. Lyttelton had clearly been obsessed by the inaccuracy of his printers: Dr Johnson claimed that the work had been printed &#145;twice over&#146;, some parts three or four times, and that this &#145;ambitious accuracy&#146; cost him at least &pound;1000. Critical opinion was mixed, but many concurred with Walpole that it was a laborious read.<br>
<br>Lyttelton died at Hagley Hall on 22 August 1773, aged sixty-four. He was buried in the parish church, where he had requested that an inscription to his memory be engraved on his first wife's monument. The account of his death given by his physician appended to Johnson's life of Lyttelton (1774) implies that he may have died of hepatitis. Johnson prints this account in full in his brief biography of Lyttelton to &#145;spare me the task of his moral character&#146;  (Johnson, 3.454). Johnson's apparent distaste for the task in hand may have sprung less from personal dislike of Lyttelton than from his particular suspicion of the two dominant areas of Lyttelton's life, his engagement in the patriot politics of the 1730s (a cause to which the young Johnson had once himself subscribed) and his claims to literary patronage, a Johnsonian <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>. Ironically, it is precisely to these two areas that more recent accounts of Lyttelton's life and work have paid especial attention.<br>
