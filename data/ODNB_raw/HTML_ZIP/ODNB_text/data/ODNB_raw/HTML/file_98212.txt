<span class="headword">Caen <span class="st"> [ de Cadomo]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1247&#150;1310), <span class="occ">notary public and royal official</span>, was one of a small number of papal notaries known to have been active in England in the late thirteenth century. Rather unusually, he spent most of his long career in the near exclusive employ of the crown rather than of the church. Despite the association of his name with the duchy of Normandy, he probably belonged to the Cambridgeshire family whose members went by the surname of de Cadomo. Apparently the son of a man named Arthur, he spent some years on the continent completing a university education before returning to his native England. Precisely where he studied is not certain; both the papal curia at Rome and the University of Bologna have been suggested. He first appears as a notary in 1268, when he drew up a public instrument supporting a claim on behalf of Boniface of Savoy, archbishop of Canterbury, in a suit against the see of York. His movements for almost a decade thereafter are uncertain, but from 1280 he was in constant attendance on Edward I, on whose business he travelled widely in Britain and Europe.<br>
<br>John Caen quickly became a valued member of the royal entourage. He was engaged in a variety of capacities: as notary, envoy, diplomat, clerk of the wardrobe, judicial arbitrator, senior chancery official, and eventually, if briefly, keeper of the great seal (in 1298 and 1302). He acted as Edward's agent in the delivery of messages and documents to La Rochelle in 1284 and at the papal curia in 1286. He was at the king's side in Aragon in October 1288 at negotiations for the release of Edward's ally Charles of Salerno, king of Naples, and once again in the king's company in 1297&#150;8 at Ghent, where Edward had encamped the English army and where a truce with Philippe IV of France was eventually agreed. His active participation in the day-to-day business of high politics gave John first-hand experience in managing complicated questions relating to diplomacy, war, and civil law, and a rare opportunity to influence the king's policies towards his European allies and enemies.<br>
<br>Distinguished though it was, John Caen's career might have passed largely unnoticed were it not for his involvement in the matter that came to be known as the Great Cause. In 1286 the sudden death of Alexander III of Scotland without male heirs threw that kingdom into disarray. Four years later the king's only direct descendant, his granddaughter Margaret, the Maid of Norway, had also perished, and the guardians of Scotland turned to Edward I with a request that he adjudicate the claims of some thirteen candidates to the throne. John Caen was already a trusted member of the royal council when the process leading to the award of the Scottish crown began, and he remained throughout the decade that followed a close adviser to Edward I on the legal and constitutional position of the Scottish kingdom. He was present at the proceedings held at Norham, and later at Berwick, from May 1291 until November 1292, taking an active part in learned discussions of the customs governing descent and inheritance at English and Scots law. Here he began to assemble both the written materials that Edward had ordered his agents to collect and the voluminous records of the claimants and their lawyers. John was particularly concerned to keep a faithful record of the oral testimony of the hundreds of expert witnesses who were called into Edward's presence. The care and attention that he brought to these tasks were nothing short of remarkable, but they were animated by a wholly pragmatic appreciation that the chief purpose of his archival efforts was justification of Edward's assertion of superiority over the smaller kingdom. Indeed, it has been argued that he co-operated with royal policy to the extent of drawing up documents that actively misrepresented the events they purported to describe, both to strengthen Edward's claim to overlordship and to avert papal intervention on behalf of the Scots. In short, John Caen was no impartial observer, and his bias must be kept in mind in any evaluation of his otherwise estimable record-keeping practices.<br>
<br>As early as May 1297, after several distinct stages of editorial work, John Caen produced two exemplars of Great Cause proceedings, along the way taking the advice of Henry of Newark, another clerk in the king's employ, and Roger Brabazon, chief justice of the king's bench. His determination to produce a thoroughly authoritative account of the proceedings kept him occupied with the rolls until at least 1303, leading him to petition Edward I on at least one occasion for permission to add materials that he claimed had been &#145;inadvertently&#146; omitted. Both copies of the great roll include a host of minor additions and corrections to stylistic or orthographic errors, each entry clearly identifiable by Caen's distinctive hand. Very soon after he had completed his compilation, Caen's comprehensive record was put to the use always intended for it, that is, as a &#145;weapon of propaganda and diplomacy&#146; in Edward I's efforts to subjugate Scotland  (Stones and Simpson, 1.91). A generation later another notary, Andrew Tange, used it as the basis for a fresh, and even more unreliable and tendentious, statement of the English claim to dominion over the smaller realm. The scrupulously organized great rolls (as they have come to be known) constitute an archival record unique among extant medieval English documents. To this day they remain a chief source of information about the antecedents of the war that divided England and Scotland down to 1560, and a rare example of the ways in which the English crown marshalled the written history that was everywhere preserved in monastic chronicles in support of its political designs. The scope and quality of the great rolls also secured John Caen's already considerable reputation as a legal expert, and from 1300 he was summoned regularly to parliament in his capacity as king's clerk, to act as a receiver of petitions and to advise the crown on questions of civil law. By now, however, age was beginning to take its toll, and although he remained active on behalf of the king he abandoned his peripatetic lifestyle and henceforth confined his energies to the precincts of the royal chancery. There he turned his well-skilled hand to scribal, clerical, and notarial tasks, occasionally issuing warrants under his own authority as custodian of the great seal.<br>
<br>During his long professional life John Caen accumulated perquisites, preferments, and rewards that bear witness to his status as a highly valued and much favoured royal servant. These included a legacy of &pound;20 from Edward's queen, Eleanor, for whom John may have acted as confessor, robes from the wardrobe, and oak trees from several of the king's forests&#151;a potentially lucrative source of ready cash. He was also presented to ecclesiastical benefices all over England and Ireland, among them the prebends of Driffield (York diocese), Leighton Manor and Wolverhampton (Lincoln), Wells (Bath and Wells), Glendalough (Dublin), and Darlington (Durham); prebends in the royal free chapels at Hastings, Penkridge, St Martin's-le-Grand (London), and Stafford; and rectories in Dorset, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Warwickshire. Indeed, so numerous were his preferments that he became the target of sharp criticism from more than one archbishop of Canterbury, but his proximity to Edward I shielded him from prosecution for pluralism and absenteeism. At the time of his death, which occurred between 23 and 28 March 1310, John Caen had only recently retired from active service at Edward II's court, and still held several ecclesiastical offices.<br>
