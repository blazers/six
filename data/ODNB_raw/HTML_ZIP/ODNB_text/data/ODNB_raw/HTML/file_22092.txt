<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phelps,  Samuel</span>  (1804&#150;1878), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 13 February 1804 at 1 St Aubyn Street, Plymouth Dock (Devonport), Devon, the seventh child and second son of Robert M. Phelps and his wife, Ann, the daughter of Captain Turner. His affluent father, whose ancestors came from Somerset, was a supplier of naval uniforms and occupied a significant social position in the town.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandtrainingasanactor"></a>Early life and training as an actor</h2>Phelps was educated at a Plymouth Dock school and at Dr Samuel Reece's classical school at Saltash, Cornwall, where he stood out as an accomplished swimmer. In 1813&#150;14 and 1818&#150;19 he visited London and went to the theatre with a cousin, Dr Hyde, a drama critic. At Covent Garden and Drury Lane he saw such leading performers as J. P. Kemble, Charles Kemble, Edmund Kean, W. C. Macready, Eliza O'Neill, and Sarah Siddons. Back home he helped backstage at the Devonport Theatre, and walked on occasionally. However, his growing theatrical ambitions were dashed abruptly when, at the age of sixteen, he was suddenly orphaned. His elder brother took him in and, pragmatically, Phelps became a junior reader for the <span class="italic">Plymouth Herald</span> newspaper. Within a year he left for London, nursing his burning theatrical aspirations.<br>
<br>London offered little opportunity for a novice actor, and so, for five years, Phelps resumed work as a reader, first for <span class="italic">The Globe</span> and then for <span class="italic">The Sun</span> newspapers. Fortunately, his fellow readers included the dramatist-to-be Douglas Jerrold and W. E. Love (a polyphonist/ventriloquist), and the three performed with a small theatrical troupe which presented weekly performances at a private theatre in Rawstorne Street (Finsbury). Phelps's life jogged on in this fashion until spring 1826, when, as a gentleman amateur, he performed successfully the role of Eustache de St Pierre in <span class="italic">The Surrender of Calais</span> and the Count de Valmont in <span class="italic">The Foundling of the Forest</span> at the Olympic. Despite Jerrold's contrary advice, Phelps abandoned journalism and secured a professional engagement on the York circuit for 18<i>s</i>. weekly. Equally impulsively, and before leaving for York, he married Sarah Cooper (1810/11&#150;1867) on 11 August 1826; she was just sixteen. However, their marriage was very happy: they were a devoted couple, and Sarah later served as Phelps's dresser. Phelps preferred home life with her to clubs or social gatherings. His other delights were angling and shooting, and he purportedly knew every trout stream in England. They had three sons and three daughters, including William Robert (1828&#150;1867), who became chief justice of St Helena, and Edmund (<i>d</i>. 1870), who became an actor. Sarah suffered from breast cancer for seven years before her death in 1867, which affected Phelps profoundly.<br>
<br>Phelps's years in the provinces from 1826 to 1837 provided invaluable though typical experience for a tyro. They were also extremely gruelling physically and financially for the young couple: Sarah lived in a wretched tenement while Phelps often walked miles from engagements to be with his wife. His first position at Pontefract in autumn 1826 typifies his experience: he played no fewer than six roles in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Indeed, his early career was a catalogue of numerous towns and of roles growing gradually in importance: he visited Hull, Sheffield, Leeds, Preston, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, and Belfast, playing Malcolm, Benvolio, the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Macduff, Claudius, and Julius Caesar. By 1830 he was attracting favourable critical notices which pinpointed his hallmark traits: his well-studied conception of a role, his ability to move audiences, and his precise, distinct diction. (Through his peregrinations in Scotland he also mastered the Scottish dialect.) There were also frustrations: for example, in Sheffield in February 1830, he was obliged to play second fiddle to a young, inexperienced Charles Kean trading on the fame of his father, Edmund. However, Phelps garnered more favourable notices than Kean junior. Within the next three years, with Lear, Macbeth, Othello, and Shylock under his belt, Phelps was hailed as an excellent Shakespearian actor. He excelled in both tragedy and comedy, and in non-Shakespearian roles, such as Sir Archy Macsarcasm in Charles Macklin's <span class="italic">Love &agrave; la Mode</span>. These experiences developed his character, suffusing it with patience and doggedness: he worked hard for his family and persisted despite adversity.<br>
<br>By 1836 Phelps hankered for the fame and fortune that London offered, but contented himself with engagements in southern England. First he impressed audiences in Worthing and then was hired by Hay for the Exeter theatre for the winter season of 1836. There local newspapers eulogized Phelps, judging him Edmund Kean's equal. (Perhaps unfairly, although inevitably, Phelps frequently laboured under the shadow of Kemble, Kean, and Macready.) Nevertheless, his Exeter Shylock was acclaimed as original in conception, and, unlike Kean and Macready, Phelps omitted making &#145;points&#146;&#151;contrived acting business designed to elicit applause from audiences at particular moments in a play. Rather, he remained consistently in character throughout. Striking, too, were his Lear and Sir Giles Overreach in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>. He also squeezed in performances at Plymouth as Virginius (in Sheridan Knowles's play), Richard III, Othello, and Iago.<br>
<br>In June 1837 Phelps returned to Devonport (living in lodgings once occupied by Edmund Kean), and played Hamlet, among other roles. He now judged the time was ripe to explore his prospects in London, since he had received overtures from Alfred Bunn, the manager of Drury Lane. When, strangely, Bunn refused to see him, he turned to Benjamin Webster at the Haymarket, who offered promises and somewhat vague terms. So, while awaiting a definite offer from Webster, Phelps fulfilled an engagement at Southampton, where his performance on 14 August 1837 as Sir Edmund Mortimer in George Colman's <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> persuaded Macready, in Southampton secretly to see Phelps, to offer the latter a contract at Covent Garden. This was to prove a crucial, career-altering moment for Phelps, particularly because he rather na&iuml;vely assumed others possessed his sense of integrity. Macready led him to believe Webster knew of the negotiations, and, since the Haymarket operated only part of the year, Phelps probably believed there was no barrier to his signing Macready's contract as well as fulfilling his obligation to Webster. Effectively, however, Phelps had placed himself under Macready's control.<h2>
<a name="LondondbutandcompetitionwithMacready"></a>London d&eacute;but and competition with Macready</h2>Phelps's choice of Shylock for his Haymarket d&eacute;but on 28 August 1837 deliberately courted comparison with Edmund Kean who, for his sensational 1814 Drury Lane d&eacute;but, had discarded Shylock's traditional red hair and beard. Critics made inescapable comparisons, not deeming Phelps's performance particularly remarkable, although they considered his conception of Shylock judicious. The audience was far more receptive, as it was when Phelps performed another Kean role, Sir Edmund Mortimer, without aping Kean's original. His expressive features, splendid voice, and good figure (combined effectively with his height of 5 foot 9 inches and grey eyes) also drew praise. Equally well-judged, maturely conceived performances of Hamlet, Othello, and Richard III followed before Phelps joined Macready at Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Phelps's salary at Covent Garden, at &pound;12 weekly, provided reasonable financial stability for his family. Virtually everything else at Covent Garden under Macready was unreasonable, for the latter soon realized Phelps was a serious threat to his own position as the period's eminent tragedian. Phelps opened on 27 October 1837, playing Jaffier in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> to Macready's Pierre. Phelps was received too warmly for Macready, who withdrew from the production. Phelps's next performance as Othello (to Macready's Iago) was so successful that, instead of rejoicing in an associate's success, Macready confined him thereafter to minor roles&#151;Cassius (<span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>), Antonio (<span class="italic">The Tempest</span>), and the Constable of France (<span class="italic">Henry V</span>). Although stoic, Phelps chaffed at the lack of opportunities and tried to induce Macready to release him; Macready would consent only if Phelps agreed to leave London. Remarkably, although he essentially had no options, Phelps signed a second contract with Macready for the 1838&#150;9 season. Not surprisingly, conditions, namely secondary roles, remained the same: Macready, as was indeed his prerogative, reserved the star spotlight for himself.<br>
<br>There was no amelioration when both actors joined Webster at the Haymarket for summer 1839. On 19 August they alternated Othello and Iago to Helena Faucit's Desdemona; Phelps's more natural Othello was preferred over Macready's rendering, and Macready persuaded Webster to withdraw the production. Again, lesser roles (such as Jaques in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>) went Phelps's way, and he concluded he would have to bide his time.<br>
<br>A chance at Drury Lane under W. J. Hammond's management in early 1840 fizzled out when Hammond decamped leaving &pound;8000 in debts. So Phelps returned to the Haymarket, his talent still eclipsed. In summer 1840 he had the galling experience of again supporting Charles Kean's bigger reputation and lesser talent by performing such roles as the Ghost (<span class="italic">Hamlet</span>) and Macduff. More satisfying was his success as Old Dornton in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> (September 1840) followed by Gabor in Byron's <span class="italic">Werner</span>, where he upstaged Macready playing the title role. In November 1840, while Macready was absent because of his daughter's death, Phelps seized the opportunity to demonstrate his versatility in the contrasting roles of Iago and Joseph Surface. That same month, a group of dramatists known as the Syncretics asked Phelps to put up &pound;500 and join them in leasing Drury Lane in order to produce some of their works. Macready allegedly got wind of the scheme and scotched it by leasing Drury Lane himself. So Phelps was obliged to return to the Haymarket and more secondary characters. The final straw came when Webster cast him as Friar Laurence in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>; Phelps quit the company, explaining in a letter to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> that he merely wanted a fair crack of the whip.<br>
<br>The Syncretics then asked Phelps to produce George Stephens's <span class="italic">Martinuzzi</span> at the Lyceum (26 August 1841). Although the play was essentially unactable, Phelps was successful both as Cardinal and Martinuzzi and as stage-manager, and the play eked out a one-month run. Some provincial touring and an engagement at the Surrey followed, and then Phelps was approached by Macready to join the company he was assembling for Drury Lane. Amazingly, and against the advice of friends, Phelps agreed. Unsurprisingly, Macready had not changed his ways, and small parts again came Phelps's way. However, their relationship warmed somewhat, especially after Macready assisted Phelps financially with a loan. Macready also gave Phelps 300 guineas when he left him in June 1843. A highlight of Phelps's career at Drury Lane was his &#145;fearfully effective&#146; portrayal of Lord Tresham in Browning's <span class="italic">A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</span> (11 February 1843), where his raging passion evoked inevitable memories of Edmund Kean's histrionics. Earlier, his portrayal of Hubert in <span class="italic">King John</span> (24 October 1842), which Phelps imbued with manly pathos, so affected Queen Victoria that she commissioned Sir William Ross to paint Phelps's portrait as that character.<br>
<br>More important in 1843, when Phelps was performing his repertory of Iago, Lear, Macbeth, and Sir Giles Overreach in the provinces, was the <span class="roman">Theatre Regulation Act</span>, which removed the exclusive rights of the patent theatres to perform &#145;legitimate&#146; drama. Ironically, since it eventually gave Phelps his big chance, Macready himself had been foremost in urging the change and had presented a petition to the House of Commons to that effect.<h2>
<a name="SadlersWells"></a>Sadler's Wells</h2>Phelps's chance came when Thomas Greenwood, the lessee of Sadler's Wells, approached him with a proposal to join him and manage the theatre with Mary Amelia Warner, a leading actress. Sadler's Wells was a large theatre with a capacity of 2500, one thousand of which occupied the pit. While it was an inexpensive theatre to rent, its location was far from ideal, being removed from central London, its theatres, and their clientele. The local Islington audience was relatively uneducated: the lower-middle classes formed its upper echelon. Thus Sadler's Wells was unfashionable and an unlikely prospect for Shakespeare and other high-minded drama. (Ironically, Edmund Kean had made his first appearance in 1801 at Sadler's Wells as the child actor Master Carey.) Nevertheless, Phelps harboured high ideals, which he enshrined in his prospectus. He believed the theatre should be a &#145;place for justly representing the works of our great dramatic poets&#146;, especially because the leading London theatres were not presenting &#145;the real drama of England&#146;. He believed that each area of London should have &#145;its own well-conducted theatre within a reasonable distance of the homes of its patrons&#146; with fair ticket prices. Further, he promised a company of &#145;acknowledged talent&#146;. So began one of the most glorious reigns of any London theatre, during which Phelps produced more than 1600 performances of thirty-one of Shakespeare's plays (the exceptions were <span class="italic">Henry VI</span>, <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span>, <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, and <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>), together with numerous works from the Renaissance to the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Phelps opened on 27 May 1844, performing Macbeth, with Mrs Warner as Lady Macbeth. A packed house was entranced by Phelps's vigorous and vivid portrayal, which such critics as attended compared unavoidably, although favourably, with Kean's and Macready's. <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> became part of a season of ninety-eight plays, of which twenty-six were main pieces (seven Shakespearian) and seventy-two afterpieces. This pattern established Phelps's policy for the remainder of his eighteen-year tenancy. Frequent changes in the repertory were necessitated by the numerically limited local audience, and Shakespearian productions were added gradually. The first season also established other enduring features. For example, <span class="italic">Richard III</span> (20 February 1845) was given in the original Shakespeare version rather than Cibber's, although Phelps still cut 46 per cent of the lines. Care was given to ensure both scenery and costuming were historically accurate, as <span class="italic">King John</span> (30 September 1844) also exemplified. Moreover, scenery, costumes, and other effects had to enhance a play and not be solely spectacular. Notable, too, was the variety of genres (tragedy, drama, and comedy) Phelps presented; his own roles included Sir Peter Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Virginius, King John, Luke Frugal in Massinger's <span class="italic">The City Madam</span>, Claude Melnotte in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>, Hamlet, and Rover in John O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>. In these productions Phelps was supported well by his company of &#145;acknowledged&#146; talent, which also contributed organically to the whole production, for, although Phelps often played leads, he was no spotlight hugger. Although Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">The Fool's Revenge</span> was not produced until 18 October 1859 (during Phelps's sixteenth season) Taylor's account of Phelps's production methods is apposite:<blockquote>[Phelps] had something of the irritability of Macready, and was not slow to give stupid, or, still more, careless people the rough side of his tongue; but his heart was so evidently in his work, &hellip; never sacrificing other scenes to his own, or other actors to himself. &hellip; [T]hough the rehearsals were so strict and elaborate they took up no more time than more slipshod ones would have done. &hellip; [R]ehearsal [was] continuous, well-considered, patient, shaping of the play for public performance, in which not merely the groupings and movements of the personages were attended to, but the delivery of every speech watched, nay, the emphasis and pronunciation of every word noted. (Taylor, 341&#150;2)</blockquote>One problem Phelps faced was the constantly changing composition of his company, which, from time to time, included George Bennett, Henry Marston, Laura Addison, Fanny Cooper, and Isabella Glyn. Although some actors remained loyal, others, once established at Sadler's Wells, moved on, typically to the central London theatres, in hopes of the fame and fortune not really to be found at Sadler's Wells. Thus Phelps and his theatre became a dramatic arts training school.<br>
<br>Subsequent seasons consolidated Phelps's initial achievements, as the repertory was enlarged with a wide range of English plays. Each season had particular highlights. In the second season an original-text <span class="italic">King Lear</span> (5 November 1845), with the Fool fully restored, was given, with Phelps stressing Lear as a suffering, outraged parent (although it was not his greatest role). More popular was Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Richelieu</span> (thirty-nine performances; Phelps as the Cardinal). That was eclipsed by the forty-five performances of <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, with Phelps as Leontes, a role Macready had performed frequently, and later to be one of Phelps's favourites after Hamlet and Macbeth. The Shakespearian novelty of the third season (now lacking Mrs Warner as co-lessee) was Phelps's unconventional rendition of Falstaff in <span class="italic">Henry IV, Part 1</span> (25 July 1846): &#145;He lays stress not on <i>Falstaff's</i> sensuality, but on the lively intellect that stands for soul as well as mind in his gross body &hellip; [Falstaff] is not vulgarised in Mr Phelps's reading&#146;  (Morley, 333). Phelps was also a notable Prospero on 7 April 1847.<br>
<br>In the fourth season Phelps introduced a <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> expunged of the singing and dancing witches inherited from eighteenth-century productions and his inventive reading of Malvolio in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (26 January 1848), where &#145;his conceit, exaltation, and profound contempt of others were admirably true. His set and abstracted look seemed to ignore the existence of those whom he despised. The picture of fatuous vanity was thoroughly incisive, and yet free from exaggeration&#146;  (Marston, 2.24). <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, and <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> (Phelps as Falstaff again) also joined the repertory, which now embraced half the Shakespeare canon. This and Phelps's larger repertory (whether or not he himself was in the cast) began to swell the ranks of the locals with the likes of Charles Dickens, John Forster, and other literati. However, royal patronage, which could have done much to boost Sadler's Wells' fortunes, remained absent. Nevertheless, Phelps did give four command performances at Windsor Castle, in 1853 (twice), 1859, and 1860.<br>
<br>Among the Shakespeare plays Phelps produced later, most notable, for differing reasons, were <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (1849), two rarely performed works, <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">All's Well that Ends Well</span> (1852), and <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1853). Although Phelps was less than successful as Antony, the lavish production, with scenery and costumes emphasizing Rome and Egypt's grandeur, achieved twenty-two performances. Phelps's Timon was judged superior to Kean's, while as Parolles in an expurgated version of <span class="italic">All's Well</span> he exploited his own comical and whimsical abilities. <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> was a more significant production, which Phelps conceived as a dream evoked and sustained by appropriate scenery and costuming. He emphasized the play's poetry, and his rendition of Bottom was subtle and eschewed external comic trappings. Such trappings were also absent in his portrayal of Sir Pertinax Macsycophant (in Macklin's <span class="italic">The Man of the World</span>, 1851), a role requiring thorough impersonation. Phelps realized it completely and topped it off with his fine Scottish accent. Altogether, the refinement and intellectuality of these productions bore Phelps's signature.<br>
<br>Further instances of Phelps's brave Shakespeare production policy were <span class="italic">Pericles</span> (14 October 1854) and <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> (30 September 1857), neither of them popular plays; indeed, <span class="italic">Pericles</span> had not been performed for nearly 200 years. Phelps gave it a spectacular production which ran for two months. His <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> was only the second production since the Renaissance (Madame Vestris had presented it at Covent Garden in 1839). It was always considered a difficult play because of its intricate sophisticated wit and minimal plot; Phelps's version was, nevertheless, considered a charming production and ran for fourteen performances. Similarly, he revived Colman and Garrick's rarely seen <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> (4 November 1857), playing Lord Ogleby successfully for twenty-eight performances. After the close of the next (fifteenth) season he took seven of his Shakespearian productions to Berlin, Leipzig, and Hamburg; critics found them admirable and worthy of emulation. Unfortunately, poor attendances caused Phelps to cut short his tour. For the summer breaks of 1860 and 1861 he accepted engagements with Augustus Harris senior at the Princess's, where he alternated Shakespearian roles with Charles Fechter (then much in vogue) and collected a handsome &pound;60 weekly.<br>
<br>What were to be the final two seasons at Sadler's Wells were undistinguished. First, Greenwood resigned as Phelps's business manager with the 1860&#150;61 season, which was remarkable mainly for the d&eacute;but of Phelps's son Edmund as Ulric in <span class="italic">Werner</span> (21 November 1860). The following season, on 21 September 1861, Phelps produced his first and only French adaptation, Casimir Delavigne's <span class="italic">Louis XI</span>, taking the title role. Later that season he learned of his wife's illness, and that, combined with the pressures of running Sadler's Wells single-handedly, ended his gallant venture on 15 March 1862.<h2>
<a name="Thelastphase"></a>The last phase</h2>Phelps was not one to give up, and he continued his acting career. In January 1863, again heedless of friends' advice, he accepted an offer from Fechter to perform at the Lyceum for &pound;40 weekly. He realized eventually that he had repeated his earlier mistake when Fechter would not assign him any roles and was simply paying him a salary to keep him off the stage and out of competition. They quarrelled when Fechter offered him merely the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>; Charles Dickens, a friend of both men and called in to adjudicate, found in Phelps's favour, declaring he should be given prominent roles. Fechter then released Phelps from his contract. Fechter also proved an irritant during the Shakespeare tercentenary celebrations of 1864. Phelps was asked to perform only Iachimo in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> at Stratford while Fechter was offered Hamlet; Phelps, rightly regarding himself as the leading English player of the day, was annoyed. Ironically, neither man performed at Stratford, although Phelps did plant an oak tree on Primrose Hill as part of the London commemorations.<br>
<br>Phelps was more fortunate in his association with Falconer and Chatterton, the managers of Drury Lane. He joined them in autumn 1863 and stayed there for seven successful years, reprising many of his old roles (for example, Falstaff, Othello, Richelieu, Wolsey, Sir Pertinax Macsycophant), as well as adding Manfred in Byron's play of that name (10 October 1863), Mephistopheles in <span class="italic">Faust</span> (20 October 1866), and the Doge in W. Bayle Bernard's <span class="italic">The Doge of Venice</span> (2 November 1867). However, these successes were eclipsed by family losses. Both his wife and his eldest son died in 1867, and his actor son, Edmund, died in 1870 at the age of only thirty-two. Somehow Phelps soldiered on, adding provincial touring to appearances at Astley's, the Princess's (where he performed Hamlet at the age of sixty-eight), the Gaiety (in novel matin&eacute;e performances introduced by John Hollingshead in 1874&#150;6), and the Aquarium. His provincial appearances are noteworthy for the connections they provide with the twentieth-century acting tradition. In 1866 at Hull he played Macbeth to Madge Kendal's Lady Macbeth, while in September 1874, at Charles Calvert's Prince's Theatre, Manchester, he first performed with Johnston Forbes-Robertson. Phelps, doubling Henry IV and Justice Shallow in <span class="italic">Henry IV, Part 2</span>, coached Forbes-Robertson as Prince Hal. He thought highly of the young actor, and they later acted together quite frequently in London. Forbes-Robertson painted Phelps's portrait as Wolsey for the Garrick Club.<br>
<br>By 1878 Phelps's health had begun to fail; he caught a bad cold, but still continued to alternate the roles of Richelieu and Wolsey at the Aquarium, the latter being his last performance, on 1 March 1878. He went to Anson's Farm, Coopersale, near Epping in Essex, to recuperate and did so sufficiently to contract with Chatterton for the 1878&#150;9 season at Drury Lane. However, a further series of colds finally felled him, and he died at Anson's Farm on 6 November 1878. His body was removed to his London home the next day, and he was buried, alongside his wife, at Highgate cemetery on 13 November 1878.<br>
<br>Phelps was a genial, kind-hearted, intellectual man, who was devoted to his family, his profession, and his hobbies. His contribution to the theatre cannot be overestimated, although it took nearly a century for its full value to be realized. As actor, manager, and producer he had a seriousness of purpose, a high moral conviction, and worked hard. He conceived productions as organic entities designed to enhance the play itself and directed his energies to that end. In restoring Shakespeare's texts he took Macready's reformations one step further. Nor should the high percentage of the Shakespeare canon he produced be overlooked. To boot, he did not neglect the remainder of the British repertory, since over half his productions at Sadler's Wells were non-Shakespearian plays. In his own acting, his careful, judicious performances stand out, and his repertory is remarkable for its range, encompassing both heroes and cowards, tragedy and comedy. He was a selfless man; he did not reserve the spotlight for himself, but nurtured others. He obviously possessed integrity and trusted others, far too much in some instances. His misfortune was to lie in the shadow of a predecessor such as Edmund Kean and such contemporaries as Macready and Fechter. Nevertheless, Phelps's achievement at Sadler's Wells, a theatre judged snootily merely because of its locale, was magnificent.<br>
