<span class="headword">Fairfax, Sir  William George</span>  (1739&#150;1813), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 8 March 1739, possibly at Windlesham, Bagshot, the son of Joseph Fairfax, an officer of the Horse Guards, of Bagshot, Surrey, and grandson of Joseph Fairfax of Saxton, Yorkshire. Fairfax entered the navy in 1750 in the <i>Centurion</i>, under Augustus Keppel, in the Mediterranean and then served in the <i>Mars</i> and the <i>Garland</i> under Marriot Arbuthnot. He was promoted lieutenant on 20 December 1757 in the <i>Duke</i>. From 1758 to 1760 he was in the <i>Eurus</i> in North America with Captain John Elphinston in the operations in the St Lawrence. Fairfax had no further employment until June 1766, when he was appointed to the <i>Greyhound</i>, and from June 1769 to September 1776 he was again on half pay as a lieutenant. In May 1778 he was promoted to the command of the cutter <i>Alert</i>. In the following month, while attached to the Grand Fleet under Keppel, and in company with the <i>Arethusa</i>, the <i>Alert</i> captured the French lugger <i>Coureur</i>, at the same time that the <i>Arethusa</i> was beaten off in her celebrated fight with the <i>Belle Poule</i>. In August, however, the <i>Alert</i> was herself captured by the frigate <i>Junon</i> (40 guns), and Fairfax was detained as a prisoner during the greater part of the American War of Independence. In January 1782 he was promoted to post rank, and appointed to the frigate <i>Tartar</i> in the West Indies, which he commanded until the peace in 1783. In 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Sheerness</i> in which (and in the <i>Repulse</i>) he remained until 1796. He was then in the North Sea Fleet, and was appointed flag-captain to Admiral Adam Duncan, the commander-in-chief of the fleet. In the <i>Venerable</i> with Duncan he shared in the difficulties of the mutiny of 1797 and the famous victory at Camperdown, where his services were rewarded by his being made a knight-banneret. He continued in command of the <i>Venerable</i> until 1798. On 7 January 1801 he was promoted to flag rank, but though considered for the third post in the Baltic fleet of 1801, he appears to have offended George, second Earl Spencer, the first lord of the Admiralty, and had no further service. He was advanced to vice-admiral on 13 December 1806. He was twice married: first, in 1767, to Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1770), daughter of the Revd Robert Spears of Burntisland; secondly, in 1772, to Janet Margaret, daughter of Samuel Charters, and cousin of Sir Samuel Greig, an admiral in the Russian service; the couple had four sons and two daughters, several of whom died young. The fourth and then only surviving son, Henry, was created a baronet in 1836 as a recognition of his father's services, while one of the daughters, Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26024/', "Somerville, Mary")</script>], married first Samuel Greig the younger, and then William Somerville. William George Fairfax, who is generally referred to by both his Christian names, settled in Burntisland, Fife, where he had property, possibly derived from his first wife or her family. He died in Edinburgh on 7 November 1813.<br>
