<span class="headword">West,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of George West of London (probably a silkman) and his wife, Margaret Bradborne, from near Northampton. On 16 May 1626 he married in All Hallows, Bread Street, Margaret Gooding, daughter of John Gooding, a London haberdasher, with whom he had two sons and four daughters. West was a principal inhabitant of Bread Street, where he traded as a silkman, and was described as an esquire in an official listing of 1642. He is not to be confused with his namesake, and fellow parishioner and <span class="occ">silkman</span> from the junior branch of the family, <a name="cosubject_73790"></a><span class="headword">Francis West</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1624&#150;1634), freeman of the Grocers' Company. The latter was the son of Francis West (<i>d</i>. 1624) of London, a &#145;grocer&#146;, and his wife, Alice, daughter of John Cheney of St John Walbrook, grocer. He married Ann Carrell, daughter of Blase Carrell of London, merchant, on 22 July 1624. His date of death is unknown.<br>
<br>Francis West of the senior branch became a common councillor for the ward of Bread Street in 1641 and in 1644&#150;5 served on the important City lands committee. By the spring of 1642 he had also become senior captain in the Blue regiment of the London trained bands under its colonel, Alderman Thomas Adams; he subsequently rose to the ranks of sergeant-major and lieutenant-colonel in 1642&#150;3. West demonstrated an early commitment to parliament, subscribing one of the radical petitions of December 1641, acting as a collector and assessor for parliamentarian levies, contributing to the cavalry, and serving on the 1643 subcommittee for new subscriptions. At the same time he joined with other godly zealots in All Hallows, Bread Street, in a petition of September 1642 for the appointment of Lazarus Seaman as their rector. When a presbyterian structure was later erected in the London province, he was appointed one of the lay triers for vetting elders.<br>
<br>A good performance as commander of the Blue regiment (in the absence of their colonel, Adams) at Gloucester and at the first battle of Newbury in September 1643 brought West to the attention and favour of the earl of Essex, who promoted him to the rank of colonel. However, this promotion was made on Essex's own authority and hence enraged the London militia committee, which claimed the right to appoint all officers in its forces. The insistence that Adams remained the legitimate colonel led to clashes with some of West's local supporters within the regiment and an intervention by the committee of both kingdoms in August 1644. Shortly afterwards West became an agent of the committee for compounding employed to extract money from sequestered royalists.<br>
<br>But West finally achieved a pre-eminent London position in May 1645 when he replaced Isaac Penington, forced out by the self-denying ordinance, as lieutenant of the Tower. West was to retain the lieutenancy until the summer of 1647, when his control of the Tower was seen as a vital element in London's attempted counter-revolution. Consequently, when Fairfax occupied the capital in August, West was removed from the lieutenancy in favour of the army's candidate, Robert Tichborne. Yet in May 1648 he was reappointed to the lieutenancy, and he retained the post until his death in the Tower, after a short illness, on 11 August 1652. His funeral was attended by militia from the Blue regiment and Tower Hamlets as the Tower's guns sounded a final salute; he was buried in London some time after 17 August. His eldest son, John West (<i>b</i>. 1628), succeeded to his estate.<br>
