<span class="headword">Wake, Sir  Isaac</span>  (1580/81&#150;1632), <span class="occ">diplomat and political commentator</span>, was the second son of Arthur Wake (<i>c</i>.1543&#150;1596), master of St John's Hospital, Northampton, and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and his wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1609), daughter of Sir William Wigston of Wolston, Warwickshire. His father had also been rector of Great Billing, Northamptonshire, from 1566 to 1573, when he was deprived of all his livings for nonconformity; he retired to Jersey for a period, but by 1576 had regained his positions at Oxford and Northampton. His elder son, Abraham, baptized at Wolston on 5 July 1577, was admitted to Christ Church early in 1593, and was soon joined by Isaac, who matriculated on 25 May, aged twelve. By this time the family was probably resident in Oxford: following his death on 12 July 1596 Arthur was buried in the choir at Christ Church. Still relatively young Isaac graduated BA on 23 July 1597, and the following year was elected a fellow of Merton College.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandsocialcircle"></a>Early career and social circle</h2>Under the wardenship of Sir Henry Savile, Merton enjoyed vigorous direction and a lively fellowship, and the college both nurtured Wake's talents and provided patrons and friends. Older colleagues included Thomas Horne and Savile's kinsman Henry Wilkinson (1566&#150;1647), who married Wake's sister Sarah, perhaps before 1601, when he became rector of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire. Wake proceeded MA on 22 February 1603 and in 1604 became public orator to the university, a post he officially retained until 1621; his admission on 14 February 1604 to the Middle Temple, where his elder brother was a barrister, was evidently honorary. Anthony Wood learned from sources at Merton that Wake &#145;had his pen more at command in the Latin, English and French tongue than any of his time in the university&#146; and &#145;that his speaking was majestic&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.539). On King James's visit to Oxford in August 1605 he delivered an oration in Christ Church which later appeared with a description of the entertainment as <span class="italic">Rex platonicus</span> (1607), dedicated to Henry, prince of Wales. His funeral oration for the Mertonian Greek scholar and biblicist John Rainolds, given on 27 May 1607, was first published in 1608. Although the king is said to have found the accomplished Ciceronian style of Wake's delivery soporific, he rewarded him on 3 July 1607 with the reversion of the keepership of Ewelme Hospital, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>In 1609 Wake obtained leave to go to France and Italy; by the end of the year he was living in Venice. When in 1610 Savile's stepson-in-law, Sir Dudley Carleton, a near contemporary of Wake at Christ Church, was appointed ambassador to Venice, Horne became his chaplain and Wake his secretary. Drawn, like Carleton, into Savile's projected edition of Chrysostom, on 2 February 1612 Wake was commissioned to make a collation with a manuscript in Venice and on 27 March Merton granted him three further years' residence abroad. None the less in October/November he was dispatched to England by Carleton to renew contact with the latter's patrons and to press his case for promotion. While in Oxford in March 1613 Wake delivered the funeral oration for another Mertonian, Sir Thomas Bodley, published later that year.<br>
<br>By mid-April 1613 Wake was back in Venice, having left behind a good impression. Thus when Carleton's longed for transfer to The Hague was announced in the summer of 1614 Wake was named as official agent until the new ambassador, Henry Wotton, arrived. His grasp of Italian was evidently better than Carleton's and the gratification he expressed to the Venetian senate at his posting to a city where in five years he had never received anything but kindness seems more than mere diplomatic politeness. When the reshuffle was delayed so that Carleton could negotiate a peace settlement between Spain and Savoy events worked further to Wake's advantage. Sent again to England by Carleton in spring 1615 he took the opportunity to cultivate his own patrons: his letter-book reveals that these included Archbishop George Abbot, Sir Horace Vere, and the lord chamberlain, to whom he acknowledged himself &#145;to be wholy apiece of your creacon&#146; and &#145;the worke of your owne hands&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18639, fol. 9<i>v</i>). Within a few days of his arrival in London he was appointed to succeed Albertus Morton as English agent in the Savoyard capital, Turin. Arriving back in Italy in midsummer he assisted Carleton with the successful conclusion of the peace of Asti, but when the latter was finally recalled in September they parted company with some coolness: Carleton's wife and sister apparently found Wake's industry officious or interfering, although he assured several correspondents that he had been &#145;a meere cifre&#146;  (ibid., fols. 8<i>r</i>, 18<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="ResidencyatTurin"></a>Residency at Turin</h2>The residency at Turin proved the most significant period of Wake's career. Initially, following the treaty, life in this third rank posting was dull, &#145;after a storme quite becalmed with peace and quiett, which to active Spiritts is as tedious as warre is dangerous&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18639, fol. 19<i>v</i>), and on 20 August he wrote to Carleton requesting the forwarding of his books, &#145;there being as greate a scarcity of that commodity here, as there is plenty of it at Venice&#146;  (ibid., 38<i>v</i>). But soon the routine work of protecting and scrutinizing passing British merchants and travellers was overtaken by higher profile diplomatic activity. Wake's intellectual and professional powers became engaged by the complex political relations of the north Italian states and their neighbours in the Swiss Confederation, and his religious sympathies were awakened by the plight of beleaguered protestants in the area; both became lifelong concerns. In January 1616 he accompanied the Savoyard representative Gabaleoni to Bern as arbitrator in negotiations for an alliance between the two states. After what seemed to him an &#145;endlesse labyrinth&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18640, fol. 45<i>v</i>) of intricate mediation involving many interested parties, the treaty concluded in June 1617 represented a triumph. Previous attempts by Henri IV and others to broker a mutual defence pact had foundered on rival claims to the Pays de Vaud, conquered by Bern in 1536, but in return for carefully calculated promises of money and troops, Savoy now renounced its interest in the protestant territory on the far side of Lake Geneva. Wake's posthumously published <span class="italic">A Three-Fold Help to Political Observations</span> (1655) attributed the untying of &#145;this Gordian knot&#146;  (p. 21) to the pious genius of James I, but his letters to secretary of state Robert Naunton reveal much of the initiative as his own.<br>
<br>Duke Charles Emanuel of Savoy, whose priority had become the security of his territories in the French Alps and Italian valleys, regularly traversed by Spanish soldiers <i>en route</i> between Genoa and the Franche Comt&eacute;, was well pleased with Wake. John Pory, who visited Turin, reported to John Chamberlain early in 1618 that he kept &#145;a port and table &hellip; more like an ambassador than an Agent, and that he is in such favor with the Duke that he will do nothing without him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.139). In a deteriorating international situation Wake became indispensable to others too: strategically placed, he negotiated with Bern and other states the passage of Count Mansfelt's anti-imperialist mercenaries over alpine passes; when from June 1618 Savoy sent subsidies to James I's son-in-law Frederick, elector palatine, his proximity to the duke also gained importance back home. Wake himself built close relations with Mansfelt and Frederick, which shaped his later perspectives. Recalled for consultation he left Turin in late October/early November 1618, delegating business to his nephew, almost certainly the young John Wilkinson. Well received in Paris and London he was promised the succession to Wotton at the Venice embassy and knighted by the king from his sickbed at Royston on 10 April 1619. At Royston he developed or renewed contact with one of his most powerful patrons, James Hay, Viscount Doncaster, James's extraordinary ambassador. His subsequent letters to Doncaster (from 1622 earl of Carlisle), with those to William Trumbull, agent at Brussels and in the &#145;confraternitye in his Majesties service&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 72320, fol. 73) and his regular dispatches to successive secretaries of state, form a three-tier commentary on international relations at this period.<br>
<br>Wake returned to Savoy in May 1619 via Brussels and Heidelberg, where he was delegated to confer with the princes of the German protestant union. Despite encountering &#145;many crocodiles&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2592, fol. 59) on his way down the Rhine, as he reported in his briefing to Doncaster, who was to follow him, he gained the princes' trust and commissions to press their case for assistance from Savoy. Once in Turin Wake tackled the difficult tasks of holding the duke to his protestant alliance when French marriage and imperial marriages were offered for his son, the prince of Piedmont, and his daughter, and of curbing his ambitions to control Geneva. Wake also found time for an unsuccessful bid for a fellowship at Merton for his nephew Wilkinson, now back in Oxford, and to become deeply interested in the fate of the Grisons (Graub&uuml;nden). This area, sandwiched between the Swiss Confederation and Austria, encompassed the Valtelline and two vital alpine passes which gave Spanish military access to Lake Constance and to south Bavaria and Bohemia. John Chamberlain, one of Wake's regular correspondents, confessed to Carleton that he had never before heard of it, but, as Venetian observers noted, Wake was not only moved by the plight of persecuted Waldenses and protestants there, but also perceived that the Grisons' fate was an acid test of Spanish and papal power, the outcome of which was of critical concern for all of western Europe. If through their inaction and division the Swiss and their potential allies, &#145;those people who stand in the centre of Europe to serve the interests of all&#146;, allowed the Grisons to fall, the Spaniards, &#145;the enemies of liberty, from whom a universal domination is preparing&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1619&#150;21</i>, 342), would then take not only Italy but also Germany.<h2>
<a name="Marriagepromotionandtheparliamentof1624"></a>Marriage, promotion, and the parliament of 1624</h2>In February 1622 Wake suffered a set-back when his attempt to succeed Savile as warden of Merton failed, despite backing from the prince of Wales. The visitor, Archbishop Abbot, protested in a letter of 26 February that, as his conscience and the world knew, he wished Wake &#145;all the good that may bee in my power&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 176, fol. 221), but he bowed to Savile's and the fellowship's desire to appoint Nathaniel Brent, another former secretary to Carleton who had resettled in England. By the summer, as he explained to Carlisle, Wake was pressed by the financial difficulties that beset diplomats: &#145;the Exchequer hath been lockt up against mee, almost three yeares&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2595, fol. 98). However, that summer rumours of his imminent promotion to Venice revived. Early in 1623 he obtained leave to return home; inevitably delayed he arrived in London in November. Here, before 6 December, with &#145;a very hansome and pithie collation&#146; made by his brother-in-law Henry Wilkinson, he was contracted to marry his &#145;sweet-heart&#146; and Chamberlain's &#145;auncient valentine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.495), Anna Bray (<i>b</i>. before 1593?, <i>d</i>. 1642), stepdaughter of secretary of state Sir Edward Conway. The wedding took place on 18 December, after the arrival of the bride's uncle, Sir Horace Vere. As Chamberlain observed, it had been a long courtship: Wake had written to Anna in terms of close friendship in 1615. The daughter of Dorothy Tracy (<i>d</i>. 1612) and her first husband, Edward Bray of Great Barrington, Gloucestershire, Anna seems to have spent part of her youth in the households of her kinsman, Sir Thomas Tracy (acknowledged by Wake as a patron in 1615), and of an aunt, perhaps Lady Vere. Wake's poverty and uncertain future, and the bride's delicate health, seem the most likely explanations for the delay; he had been comfortably fixed in her pious family circle.<br>
<br>In January 1624 Wake was finally named ambassador to Venice. As Chamberlain informed Carleton, he had a &#145;large commission for all Italie, and to kepe agents in Piemont, Switzerland, &hellip; among the Grisons, and elsewhere as he shall find fit for the king's service&#146;; he was &#145;to be a kind of ambassador paramount, or like an archbishop to many suffragans&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.540). By the end of the month he had been chosen with secretary of state Sir George Calvert as member for Oxford University in the parliament that met in February. There he argued for the war against Spain on which his commission largely rested. Like Carlisle and Sir Robert Anstruther he lingered in London as long as possible to await the upshot, and left only as the session ended. His wife was to follow at leisure.<h2>
<a name="EmbassyatVenice"></a>Embassy at Venice</h2>The embassy at Venice began auspiciously enough. Venetians noted approvingly his close link with the secretary, Conway, and his own local knowledge, reassuring behaviour and sympathy for their interests. Wake, &#145;your magnifico of Venice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.467), knew how to play the part. However, ultimately he proved little more successful than his predecessors. Like them he had constant financial worries and fretted over maintaining goodwill at court: Conway was not always communicative and Carlisle, on his travels, was often elusive, although a visit from the latter's son Doncaster allowed Wake to gain favour through his careful attentions to the young man. When his friend Trumbull gained preferment in England he asked him wistfully to &#145;remember mee sometimes when you are in your kingdom&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 72323); later he sent one of his secretaries, Peter Moreton, to court to report back. There were problems too in Venice. Lady Wake disliked the local diet and, succumbing to a serious illness, nearly died in autumn 1627. Although Wake followed the practice of Carleton and Wotton in escaping frequently to the congenial university town of Padua, he also spent such prolonged periods in Savoy (including his first six months of embassy from July to December 1624) that the Venetians concluded, wrongly but damagingly, that he was a creature of the duke. Wake in turn concluded that papalist factions were gaining the upper hand over &#145;patriots&#146; in the republic, to the detriment of his mission.<br>
<br>Wake's official aim, verified with Conway in May 1625, was to secure the restoration of the palatinate. This involved continued liaison with Bern, Z&uuml;rich, and Geneva, and justified his commitment to the Valtelline. In the unfolding tragedy of violent suppression there, graphically described to Conway in 1627 and 1628, he increasingly came to see the conspiratorial hand of France alongside that of Spain, and linked it to Cardinal Richelieu's plot with the pope for &#145;the extirpation of all the Protestants in France&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34311, fol. 108<i>v</i>). As he saw it, &#145;the balance of power in Europe&#146;  (ibid., 241<i>v</i>) lay in Charles I's hands: a particularly frank expression of &#145;private conceits&#146; to Carlisle on 17 March 1629 urged his patron to move the king to act. Protestants must &#145;hereafter relye wholye uppon the protestation of God &hellip; accounting for true friends none but those of our owne Religion&#146;  (ibid., fol. 292<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="EmbassyinFranceandlegacy"></a>Embassy in France and legacy</h2>By this time frustration had led Wake to leave Venice permanently for Savoy, and recurrent ill health had driven his wife home, but enforced inactivity while others attempted flawed peace negotiations with France continued to irk him. He wrote to Carlisle on 23 April 1629 that &#145;wee have had here much to do, &amp; have done nothing: our business proved like the sheering of a Hogg&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34311, fol. 316). Following the conclusion of peace and months of rumours, in January 1630 he received letters of credence as ambassador to France, a promotion. There was much scepticism about the likely effectiveness of this well-known opponent of French foreign policy, and thus much uncertainty through that year as he lingered, detained in Savoy by unfinished business. It was only after an outbreak of plague had removed thirteen of his household and replacements had been dispatched from England that he arrived in Paris in March 1631, only to place his household in quarantine. Further delays in gaining audiences with Louis XIII and Richelieu and the gulf between English and French objectives in Germany contributed to a general lack of progress. However, although Conway's death in January 1631 had removed a vital line of communication he was once again on good terms with Carleton (now Viscount Dorchester and secretary of state), who shared his perspectives. When Dorchester also died, on 15 February 1632, Wake enlisted Carlisle to argue his case to succeed as secretary, but this reward eluded him. He died suddenly in Paris of a fever on 10 June (31 May <span class="smallcap">OS</span>). His body was escorted to Dover, where it arrived on 6 July (<span class="smallcap">OS</span>) and was buried in the castle chapel, the funeral sermon being given by the minister, John Reading, who had known him at Oxford.<br>
<br>Wake left his wife in straitened circumstances. An undated petition to the king from &#145;your Majesties poore handmaide in all humilitie casting her selfe downe at the feete of good Josia the king of Juda&#146; supplicated for the pension and payment of arrears of expenses promised to the widow of a man &#145;knowne for abilities, honestie, and integritie to his Maister, to be a man of a Thowsand&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2597, fol. 112). Assisted by William Weld of Addle Street, London, an old friend of her husband, she obtained a &pound;200 annuity from her half-brother Edward, second Viscount Conway, but was still short of money and entangled in a Star Chamber suit in February 1636. John Wilkinson also experienced difficulty in getting &#145;recompense&#146; for the &#145;choice collection of papers&#146; bequeathed him by Wake, &#145;(being all he had to leave to his nearest kinsman)&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 525), which he had delivered up to the secretary of state Sir John Coke. In addition to his letter-books Wake had also accumulated notes of speeches and treaties of the 1620s in which he and Carleton were involved. It is not clear who edited for publication <span class="italic">Divine meditations &hellip; whereto is adjoyned, a determination of &hellip; whether men ought to kneele at the receipt of the holy communion and an essay of friendship</span> (1641) or <span class="italic">A Three-Fold Help to Political Observations</span> (1655). The latter, consisting of &#145;three discourses&#146; &#145;concerning the thirteen cantons of the Helveticall League&#146;, &#145;declaring the state of Italy, as stood &hellip; about the year 1625&#146; and &#145;touching the King of Sweden in his wars in Germany&#146; testifies to the scope of his interests and to his taste for careful political observation and analysis, played out against a strong protestant faith.<br>
