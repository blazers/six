<span class="headword">Thomas,  George</span>  (1756&#150;1802), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was born in a farm cottage at Roscrea, co. Tipperary. According to his own account he joined the British navy at Bristol in 1780, where he acquired his knowledge of gunnery. Arriving at Madras in 1781 he deserted ship and went to Kelly's grog shop (the proprietor being a fellow Tipperarian). Advised to offer his services as a mercenary, he travelled south to the Kanara Poligars, a group of armed chieftain-bandits. Thomas subsequently joined the nizam of Hyderabad's army as a private, and there learned his trade as a soldier. He gathered around him a personal bodyguard, nicknamed the Irish Pindaris, after the feared Indian mercenaries who &#145;issued like wild dogs from between the feet of their nominal masters &hellip; to slay, to burn, to plunder, and to disappear&#146;  (Smith, 567). Words of command were given by Thomas in Gaelic to maintain secrecy.<br>
<br>Travelling north to Delhi with his troops and a 6-pounder gun, Thomas was recruited by Zeb-un-Nisa, the Begam Samru of Sardhana, widow of Walter Reinhard, a notorious European mercenary. The begam, who had become a Roman Catholic after her husband's death, appointed Thomas an officer in her army, and arranged for his marriage to her god-daughter Maria, which took place on 29 April 1787. The marriage contract, written in Portuguese, was drawn up by the begam's priest, Father Gregorius. Three sons and a daughter were born of the marriage. The begam's confidence in the wild Irishman was justified at the siege of Gokulgarh in March 1788, where the begam was supporting the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II against a rebellious local chief. Thomas gave valuable support and was rewarded with a <i>jagir</i> (a temporary grant of land) at Tappal, from which he collected the revenue. By imposing law and order he was shortly able to double the <i>jagir's</i> income.<br>
<br>In 1792, during a foray against Sikh bandits north of Sardhana, Thomas was dismissed from the begam's service, most likely for trying to usurp her authority. He took refuge in the British garrison at Anupshahr, on the Ganges, but within the year was employed by the Maratha governor of Meerut, Appa Khande Rao, cousin to Mahadji Sindhia of Gwalior. Here he raised a battalion, whose main purpose was to collect land revenue by using coercion and terrorism. His success was rewarded by gifts and the <i>jagir</i> of Jhajjar, 50 miles west of Delhi. This became his base and he built the fort of Georgegarh, the name being corrupted in Hindustani to Jahazgarh. By 1796 Thomas had made peace with the begam, coming to her rescue and helping to suppress a mutiny among her own troops. He left Appa Khande Rao in 1797 to join Bapu Sindhia, governor of Saharanpur, another Maratha chief, and was engaged to harass the Sikhs, then jostling for power in northern India. But in a disgraceful scene the pugnacious Thomas actually attacked his employer in front of a new common enemy, the Afghan invader Zaman Shah. Thomas escaped to the safety of Jhajjar with about 2500 of his own men, but was faced with the problem of paying and feeding them. Unusually for the time, he paid disability allowances to his wounded soldiers, and pensions to the soldiers' widows.<br>
<br>In the fluid situation before the East India Company imposed its rule, and when large areas of land were left virtually ungoverned following the collapse of the Mughal empire, Thomas conceived the extraordinary idea of making himself &#145;King&#146; of Lahore by conquering the Punjab. He marched his troops into Hariana in 1797 and easily captured the towns of Hissar and Hansi. He found the latter, an ancient fort, inhabited by one fakir and two lions. He stabilized an area of 120 miles by 50 miles in Hariana and repopulated Hansi, later to become the home of Colonel James Skinner (1778&#150;1841), another soldier of fortune. At the height of his fame that year Thomas described himself as &#145;dictator in all the countries belonging to the Sikhs south of the Sutlej&#146;  (Smith, 567), and claimed to hold his land on behalf of the British government.<br>
<br>But the necessity for money led to Thomas's re-employment as a mercenary, by the Maratha Vaman Rao against the Rajput raja of Jaipur, to collect unpaid taxes, which he succeeded in doing. His ultimate downfall was in a new alliance between the Marathas, commanded by the European mercenaries Colonel Perron, Captain Felix Smith, and Louis Bourquien, and their former enemies the Sikhs, desperate at Thomas's incursions against them. At first Thomas made a spirited resistance, lifting the siege of Georgegarh, but, as more victims of his impartial bloodletting united against him, his own men began to desert. Thomas was forced into a humiliating surrender to Bourquien, although he was honourably treated as a brave soldier, and allowed to leave India for his native Ireland with several lakhs of rupees and property. Many years of constant heavy drinking had weakened Thomas's constitution, and he died from fever at Berhampore, on his way to Calcutta, on 22 August 1802, aged forty-six. He was buried in the cantonment cemetery at Berhampore. His wife and children remained as pensioners at Sardhana until Begam Samru's death in 1836.<br>
