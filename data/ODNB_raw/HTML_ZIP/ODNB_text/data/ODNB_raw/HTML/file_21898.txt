<span class="headword">Pepper,  John Henry</span>  (1821&#150;1900), <span class="occ">illusionist and educationist</span>, was born at Great Queen Street, Westminster, on 17 June 1821, the son of Charles Bailey Pepper (<i>d</i>. 1854), a civil engineer. He was educated at Loughborough House, Brixton, and King's College School, in the Strand, London, and was then a pupil of the chemist John Thomas Cooper. In 1840 he was appointed assistant chemical lecturer at the Granger school of medicine. He married on 22 May 1845 Mary Ann Benwell; they had no children of their own but adopted a son.<br>
<br>In 1847 Pepper gave his first lecture at the Royal Polytechnic in Regent Street (founded in 1838), and in 1848 he was appointed analytical chemist and lecturer to that institution. Some four years later he became &#145;honorary&#146; director of the polytechnic at a fixed salary, a post he held for twenty years. He lectured frequently at the polytechnic, and was invited to numerous schools, at which he delighted juvenile audiences by popular experiments, illusions, and magic-lantern displays. He also issued a series of unpretentious manuals of popular science, which had a wide circulation. Among the most popular was <span class="italic">The Boy's Playbook of Science</span> (1860), an extensively illustrated manual of experiments which could be carried out in the home to demonstrate the properties of matter. A revised edition appeared in 1912. On the title-pages of his books he described himself as fellow of the Chemical Society, and honorary associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. His title of professor was conferred upon him &#145;by express minute of the Polytechnic board&#146;, and was not therefore, he was careful to explain, that of a hairdresser or a dancing master  (Pepper, 2).<br>
<br>Pepper ran educational classes in connection with the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington. These hardly covered the costs of his lease of the premises at the polytechnic, which was severely hit by declining attendances in the winter of 1862, following the success of the second Great Exhibition. His instincts as a showman succeeded in reviving the popularity of the institution and ensuring its future by means of presentations of an optical illusion, involving mirrors and a hidden stage, described by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as the most wonderful ever put before the public. In September 1858 Henry Dircks of Blackheath had communicated to the British Association the details of an apparatus for producing &#145;spectral optical illusions&#146;. The idea was rejected by several entertainers, but Pepper recognized its potential and, after some not very important modifications in the machinery, exhibited the &#145;ghost&#146; for the first time on 24 December 1862, in illustration of Dickens's <span class="italic">Haunted Man</span>. On 5 February 1863 the apparatus was patented in the joint names of Pepper and Dircks. The two men later fell out, Dircks complaining with some justification that his name as that of sole inventor was unduly obscured in the advertisements of the exhibition. Popularly known as &#145;Pepper's ghost&#146;, the illusion had an enormous vogue, was visited by the prince and princess of Wales (19 May 1863), commanded to Windsor, and transferred to the boards of many London theatres, to the Ch&acirc;telet at Paris, to Wallack's Theatre, New York, and to the Crystal Palace.<br>
<br>In March 1872 Pepper temporarily transferred his exhibit to the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, but lost money on it. He travelled with his show in America and Canada during 1874&#150;9, and took it to Australia in 1879&#150;81. He settled in Brisbane as public analyst from 1881 to 1889, when he returned to England. He reintroduced his &#145;ghost&#146; at the polytechnic, but the spectre failed to appeal to a sophisticated public, and its proprietor withdrew into private life. His first wife died in December 1889 and he married again. Later he entered the Church of Rome. The &#145;Professor&#146; died at Ifield Villa, 55 Colworth Road, Leytonstone, Essex, on 25 March 1900, leaving a widow, Janet. He was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
