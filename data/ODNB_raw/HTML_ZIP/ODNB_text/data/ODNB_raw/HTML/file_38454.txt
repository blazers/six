<span class="headword">Strange,  Frederick</span>  (1810<span class="mult">x</span>18&#150;1854), <span class="occ">natural history collector</span>, was probably born at Aylsham, Norfolk, between 1810 and 1818. His parentage is unknown, although Strange is an ancient Norfolk surname. In 1836 he left England, probably as a crew member of the <i>Cygnet</i>, to become one of the first European settlers of South Australia. At first he was engaged in fishing, but in 1838 accompanied the explorer Charles Sturt (1795&#150;1869) on surveys, and in 1839 was attendant to the surveyor T. Bowes Strangways on his expedition to the north of Adelaide. On this trip a small saltwater creek was named Strange's Creek. In 1839 Strange again accompanied Sturt, on his expedition with Governor Gawler to the Murray River. He also met John Gould, the English ornithologist, and this meeting may have inspired him to become a professional natural history collector.<br>
<br>By 1840 Strange had moved to New South Wales, where he became mate of the coastal steamer <i>Tamar</i>, based at Gosford. About this time he married Rosa Prince, of Sydney; they had four (possibly five) children between 1841 and 1853. By May 1843 Strange had moved to Sydney, becoming a full-time collector and dealer in natural history specimens. The following year he met Gould's collector, John Gilbert, and John MacGillivray, naturalist of HMS <i>Fly</i>. Both men seem to have stayed with Strange at this time, and henceforth Strange appears to have acted as their agent. Later in 1844 (and also in 1847, 1850, and 1851), Strange collected at Moreton Bay, near Brisbane.<br>
<br>Between May and September 1845 Strange made a trip back to Adelaide, apparently as an agent for a Mr Newman. On his return to Sydney, he sent many requests for employment to John Gould, accompanied by glowing testimonials; Strange correctly assumed that Gilbert had perished on the Leichhardt expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (1844&#150;6). Gould did briefly use Strange's services, but the partnership broke up amid much acrimony; Strange apparently drew money on both Gould and the Australian Museum's curator, George Bennett, and in 1848 Gould complained that Strange's latest collection had arrived back in England in bad condition. The final straw came when Strange flooded the market with molluscs, sending identical shells to the two most senior experts in Britain, Hugh Cuming and George Sowerby.<br>
<br>In 1848 Strange went to New Zealand on HMS <i>Acheron</i>'s surveying voyage under John Lort Stokes; the ship arrived back in Sydney in November 1849. In 1852 Strange visited England with his family, arriving with a large natural history collection; they had returned to Sydney by March 1853. In 1854 he entered into a trading venture to the islands off north-east Australia, leaving Sydney in the <i>Vision</i> in September 1854. On 15 October Strange's party was attacked by Aborigines on the Second Percy Island, of the Capricorn group; Strange and three others were killed.<br>
<br>Frederick Strange, despite difficulties with literacy (his grammar and spelling were both extremely eccentric) and money management, was an able man in the field and collected much of scientific importance. Among the many new forms which he discovered were the yellow-footed rock-wallaby <i>Petrogale xanthopus</i>, the plains wanderer, <i>Pedionomus torquatus</i>, and the superb blue wren, <i>Malurus cyaneus cyanochlamys</i>.<br>
