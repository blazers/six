<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  Nathaniel</span>  (1585&#150;1627), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Redgrave in Suffolk in August 1585, the grandson of Lord Keeper Bacon and the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1003/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon (c.1543&#150;1624)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Bacon, Sir Nathaniel (1546?&#150;1622)")</script>], subsequently the premier baronet of England, and his wife, Anne Butts (<i>c</i>.1547&#150;1616). He was admitted to the Order of the Bath in February 1626 to mark Charles I's coronation. Raised at Redgrave Hall, Bacon acquired Brome Hall in Suffolk on his marriage, on 1 May 1614, to Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meautys (1580/81&#150;1659) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6342/', "Bacon, Jane")</script>], widow of Sir William Cornwallis, and inherited Culford Hall, 4 miles north of Bury St Edmunds, from his parents.<br>
<br>Bacon has been described as &#145;The most accomplished [British] amateur painter of the [seventeenth] century&#146;  (Jackson-Stops, 150), although fewer than a dozen of his works survive, of which a number are self-portraits. The earliest documentary reference to specific pictures appears in the will of the author William Austin, of Southwark, signed on 19 May 1632, which bequeathed &#145;Joseph and Mary made by Sir Nathaniel Bacon&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/165/14). A later reference is in the inventory of Culford attached to his widow's will of 1659, which mentions &#145;Ten great peeces in wainscoate of fish and fowle &amp;c done by Sr: Nath: Bacon&#146;. The <span class="italic">Cookmaid with Still Life of Birds</span>, still in the possession of the artist's descendants, is thought to be one of these, as are the <span class="italic">Cookmaid with Still Life of Game</span>, acquired by the family in the 1950s, and the Tate collection's <span class="italic">Cookmaid with Still Life of Vegetables and Fruit</span>, all executed about 1620 to 1625. A tiny <span class="italic">Landscape</span>, painted on copper, bearing the conjoined monogram NB (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), is thought to be the &#145;small Landskip drawn by Sir Nath. Bacon&#146; listed in the Tradescant Collection in 1656  (<span class="italic">Musaeum Tradescantianum</span>, 1656, 40). If so it is the first known pure landscape by an English-born artist.<br>
<br>The main surviving source of personal information about Bacon is a group of letters to his wife, a considerable heiress and formerly an attendant of James I's queen, Anne of Denmark. These letters show Bacon as a devoted family man, much interested in his own health, and enthusiastic about horticulture. They also indicate that he travelled to the Low Countries and, judging from his artistic style and technique, it is extremely likely that he received some training there. No other British artist of the period painted still lifes, and indeed the cookmaid subject originated in the Low Countries. The Antwerp artist Frans Snijders was a major exponent of the genre, and Bacon visited that city in 1613.<br>
<br>A gentleman, Bacon did not need to paint for his living but his art was clearly significant to him. His funerary monument in St Mary's Church, Culford, bears two carved painter's palettes. He also included his palette and brushes in his great, full-length self-portrait (<i>c</i>.1620, priv. coll.). Contemporaries alluded to his skills as an artist. In 1622 Henry Peacham commended him as a well-born Englishman who could draw and paint, while Edward Norgate credited Bacon with inventing a particular &#145;Pinke&#146; (that is to say, yellow) apparently used by other artists, such as Peter Oliver and John Hoskins. The antiquary George Vertue, who noted the Culford monument in 1739, stated that Bacon had visited Italy, but there is no corroborating evidence for this; Vertue also mentioned two mythological paintings, now lost.<br>
<br>Bacon died in June 1627 and was buried at St Mary's, Culford, on 1 July 1627. The record of his funeral states that he died of &#145;a lingering illness&#146;, and the letters indicate a decline in health from about 1622. Of his three children only Anne (<i>b</i>. 1615), who married, second, Sir Harbottle Grimston, had any children. Unusually wide-ranging in his work as a painter, perhaps as a result of his Netherlandish travels, Bacon explored genres not attempted by his British contemporaries, whose work was almost entirely confined to portraiture.<br>
