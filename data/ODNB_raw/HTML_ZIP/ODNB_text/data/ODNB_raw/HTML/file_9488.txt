<span class="headword">Fishacre,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1248), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and theologian</span>, was probably born in the first decade of the thirteenth century in Exeter&#151;a Merton College manuscript identifies him as <i>Exoniensis</i>. The name Fishacre was prominent among the gentry of Devon, being mentioned in the records over 160 times between the twelfth century and the death of the last Fishacre, Sir Edward, in 1433 or 1434. Of the three places in south Devon that include the name, none is recorded until after 1228, so it probably began as a nickname for a Norman knight-turned-landowner who used fish to manure his fields. Fishacre entered the order of Preachers not long after their arrival in the British Isles in 1221. Wherever he studied the arts (and there is no evidence that it was anywhere but England), he incepted in theology under the Dominican master Robert Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1248) at the Oxford studium. About the year 1240 Fishacre became master of sacred doctrine and embarked on his most ambitious project, a commentary (soon to be published by the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften) on Peter Lombard's four books of <span class="italic">Sentences</span>. This work was the first of its kind to be composed by an English Dominican, and indeed by any Oxford master, and drew a swift and hostile reaction from Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1253). Grosseteste was ostensibly complaining about the scheduling of lectures, but the subtext was his worry that Fishacre was introducing at Oxford the Parisian custom of using Lombard's text as the basis for purely speculative theology, thus threatening the pre-eminence of sacred scripture. Fishacre's enterprise, however, was defended by the pope, Innocent IV, in a strongly worded letter to Grosseteste, and eventually the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> became the set text in the theology faculty at Oxford as they had done at Paris.<br>
<br>In his commentary, Fishacre conceives of the Aristotelian sciences as being preliminary to the science of theology, analogous to Abraham's needing to have relations with the slave Hagar before Sarah could conceive. He was therefore open not only to the newly translated Aristotelian philosophy but also to the commentaries of Averroes 
    (Ibn Rushd; <i>d</i>. 1198)
  . Having finished the commentary by 1245, in the remaining three years of his life Fishacre composed several <i>opuscula</i>. Among these was a work on heresies (<span class="italic">Adnotationes in s. Augustini librum de haeresibus</span>), which attempted a rational refutation of the heresies listed and described by St Augustine in his work by that name. He also composed a question on the ascension of Christ, which made use of the concepts of Aristotelian physics and cosmology to explicate this theological teaching. There also survive, in more recent manuscripts of his commentary, four <i>quaestiones</i> (on the eternity of the world, on the nature of light, on the division of the waters at creation, and on the nature of the heavens), all most probably products of disputations dating from the last three years of his life. Besides a number of Latin sermons nothing more from Fishacre's pen has been identified. Though Nicholas Trevet credits him with postils on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> (nos. 1&#150;70), this text seems not to have survived. For the remaining works ascribed to him by later bibliographers, namely, a commentary on the parables of Solomon, a <span class="italic">De poenitentia</span>, <span class="italic">Quodlibeta</span>, and a <span class="italic">De fide, spe et caritate</span>, there exists no earlier nor more reliable testimony than that of John Leland (<i>d</i>. 1552).<br>
<br>Though a final judgement regarding Fishacre's influence will have to await the edition of his commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, it is safe to assert that his mark on his own and the following generation of theologians at Oxford and at Paris was significant. His students included Simon of Hinton, who succeeded him in the chair of theology, Master R. of Stanington, and Robert Kilwardby (<i>d</i>. 1279). He is cited extensively in a pastoral manual composed about 1250 by a Master Galienus, and referred to frequently by the Franciscan Richard (Rufus) of Cornwall, for whom Fishacre was something of a <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>. A colophon in a Paris manuscript asks for the reader's prayers for Friar Richard, describing him as infirm in mind and body, and indeed his weak constitution seems to have led to his early death in 1248, the year that also saw the death of Robert Bacon. Both were buried at the new Dominican priory outside the walls of Oxford. The chronicler Matthew Paris (<i>d</i>. 1259), who generally wasted little affection on the mendicants, asserted in an encomium on Fishacre and Bacon that in theology and in the other sciences they had no living superiors nor even equals; they had lectured eminently in the same faculty for many years, and to the people they generously preached the word of God.<br>
