<span class="headword">Bonwicke,  Ambrose</span>  (1691&#150;1714), <span class="occ">nonjuror</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2862/', "Ambrose Bonwicke (1652&#150;1722)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stubbs (<i>d</i>. 1722), was born in the Schoolmaster's house, Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 30 September 1691. He grew up in Headley, Surrey, and in 1703 entered the Merchant Taylors' School in London, where his father had been headmaster. He spent more than seven years there, and, having reached the head form, was eligible for election to St John's College, Oxford. However, his refusal to read the prayer for Queen Anne and the house of Hanover deprived him of this advantage and compelled him to seek admission to St John's College, Cambridge, which had gained a reputation as a nonjuror stronghold.<br>
<br>Having entered St John's, Cambridge, in August 1710, Bonwicke's exemplary conduct and acquirements quickly procured him a scholarship, the enjoyment of which was somewhat marred by the scruples of an oversensitive conscience. The statutes, to his mind, not only enjoined personal obedience but implied some control over others. &#145;Am I&#146;, he asked his father, &#145;by the words &#147;faciam ab aliis observari&#148;, which are part of the oath, obliged to tell lads continually their duty as far as I know it, and also to inform against transgressors?&#146;  (Bonwicke, 30). Happily his mind was set at ease on this point and he was able to continue in college, enthusiastically devoting himself to study and to religious exercises. &#145;His temperance was always very great, and his fasting and abstinence rather more than his weak constitution could well bear&#146;  (ibid., 32). Further reports may also suggest that Bonwicke suffered from tuberculosis. He died, unmarried, on the evening of 5 May 1714 in his college study, his favourite devotional works by Robert Nelson and Edward Lake beside him. He was buried four days later at All Saints' churchyard, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Bonwicke's father, at the suggestion of the printer William Bowyer, drew up an account of his son's life but desired that its authorship should be concealed. Bowyer edited the memoir after the death of Bonwicke the elder, and in 1729 published <span class="italic">A Pattern for Young Students in the University, Set Forth in the Life of Mr. Ambrose Bonwicke</span> with the intent to present &#145;the virtues of a private life&#146; for general &#145;imitation&#146;  (Bonwicke, 1). It is interesting not merely as a picture of college life and reading habits in the early eighteenth century, but also because it depicts the nature and development of the scrupulous conscience which made both father and son nonjurors.<br>
