<span class="headword">O'Meara,  Barry Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1770?, <em>d.</em> 1836), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in Ireland, the son of Jeremiah O'Meara, variously described as an army officer and a member of the legal profession, and a Miss Murphy, sister of Edmund Murphy MA of Trinity College, Dublin. Different sources give the year of his birth as 1770, 1778, and 1786. He is said to have been a member of the Irish medical family of whom Dermod Meara was a member. He is also said to have been educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and to have been a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, but there is no record of his affiliation to either institution, and his granddaughter's religion and particularly his ready acceptance into Napoleon's household suggest that he may have been a Roman Catholic, in which case his attendance at Trinity College would have been impossible. It is similarly impossible to substantiate the suggestion that he trained in surgery in London. He joined the 62nd regiment in 1804 as an assistant surgeon and served in Sicily, Egypt, and Calabria, but was cashiered after acting as second in a duel while in Sicily. He joined the navy as an assistant surgeon and served initially on the <i>Victorious</i> off Sicily in 1810. After further service on the <i>Espi&egrave;gle</i> and the <i>Goliath</i> (58 guns) he chanced to be on the <i>Bellerophon</i> (74 guns) on 7 August 1815 when Napoleon came on board to surrender himself. O'Meara's professional skill and knowledge of Italian commended him to Napoleon, whom he agreed to accompany to the island of St Helena as his personal surgeon, once he had official permission to undertake this duty while remaining officially in naval service. The party arrived at St Helena on board the <i>Northumberland</i> on 15 October 1815. They were housed at Longwood House, on the Deadwood plain, where O'Meara became not only Napoleon's medical adviser but also his confidant.<br>
<br>Relations between Napoleon's household and the British authorities were initially fairly cordial, though Napoleon's domestic arrangements were uncomfortable and solitary residence on the remote and inhospitable island was hardly the outcome he had had in mind when he surrendered himself. However, with the arrival in April 1816 of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17080/', "Sir Hudson Lowe")</script>, who in 1815 had been appointed governor of the island, matters deteriorated markedly. Some see Lowe's restrictions on Napoleon's household as petty and arbitrary; others see them as evidence that he was dutifully if over-assiduously fulfilling his charge of guarding Napoleon. Personal relations between Napoleon and Lowe were always poor and when they collapsed completely O'Meara initially acted as a channel for information between Plantation House and Longwood House. Eventually however relations between O'Meara and Lowe also broke down. Lowe confined O'Meara to Longwood House. At this O'Meara resigned, whereon Lowe ordered him off the island with little notice. He left the island in July 1818 and returned to England. Some have interpreted O'Meara's actions as part of the systematic and deliberate irritation of the authorities by Napoleon's household, while others have interpreted them as the result of a genuine feeling that the British authorities had acted at least shabbily and at worst deceitfully in their treatment of Napoleon.<br>
<br>Back in England on 28 October 1818 O'Meara wrote to the Admiralty alleging that Napoleon's life was not safe while Lowe remained governor. The Admiralty thereon removed his name from the navy list. O'Meara then set himself to continue his attacks on Lowe in print. These had begun with the anonymous <span class="italic">Letters from the Cape of Good Hope</span> (1817) and continued with <span class="italic">Exposition of some of the transactions that have taken place at St Helena since the appointment of Sir Hudson Lowe as governor</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">Napoleon in Exile: a Voice from St Helena</span> (2 vols., 1822), both works being published over his own name. The latter was generally critical of the way in which Napoleon had been treated after his surrender and in particular portrayed Lowe as spiteful, arbitrary, and vindictive. It was received with scepticism, not least because of inconsistencies between it and earlier accounts by O'Meara. These inconsistencies were detailed by John Wilson Croker in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for October 1822 (28.219&#150;64) and the book was savagely reviewed by Christopher North in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (14.172) but defended in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> for June 1822 (37.164&#150;204). The book rapidly went through five editions and was issued in translation in France. Lowe obtained a rule <i>nisi</i> for criminal information against O'Meara in Hilary term 1823, but it was afterwards discharged on technical grounds. Following legal advice that the onus was now on O'Meara to accuse Lowe of perjury if he wanted to challenge the veracity of Lowe's denials, Lowe decided not to proceed further with this action.<br>
<br>Napoleon had in the meantime died on 5 May 1821 at Longwood, St Helena. He had been in poor health from shortly after his arrival on the island and O'Meara had attempted unsuccessfully to treat him for insomnia, pain in the region of the liver, and swelling of the legs. An autopsy, performed at the house by Napoleon's Italian surgeon Francesco Antommarchi, failed to establish unambiguously the cause of death but cast doubt on the hypothesis that he suffered from liver disease, since that organ, unlike his kidneys, heart, and particularly his stomach, was found to be healthy. Antommarchi secretly removed a piece of the ulcerated lining of the stomach which he later gave to O'Meara. Suggestions that Napoleon was poisoned with arsenic stimulated much writing, including that by O'Meara, about his illness, as did the feeling that his physical and psychological health had been harmed by the circumstances of his exile in a damp, lonely, isolated place. In fact, however, although he was described as &#145;the confidential medical attendant of the Emperor Napoleon in his last days&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 1836, 219), O'Meara had had no influence on Napoleon's last illness since he left the island nearly three years before he died.<br>
<br>O'Meara married on 10 February 1823 at her house by special licence Theodosia-Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of Sir Edward Boughton, sixth baronet, of Lawford, Warwickshire, and his second wife, Anna Maria Beauchamp. Theodosia-Beauchamp was the widow of Captain John Donellan (<i>d</i>. 1781) and of Sir Egerton Leigh, bt (<i>d</i>. 1818). At the time of the marriage O'Meara was being prosecuted by Lowe. The marriage made his personal circumstances very easy, his new wife enjoying the fortune gained by her first husband by murdering her brother. O'Meara is said to have been twice married, but the details of his other marriage are not known. O'Meara became a follower of Daniel O'Connell. He died at his home on the Edgware Road, London, on 3 June 1836, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1836, 219) of erysipelas in the head caught at one of O'Connell's meetings. The sale of his effects on 18 and 19 July attracted considerable attention since it included several relics of Napoleon. The eldest surviving daughter of his son Dennis O'Meara of Tipperary was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20756/', "Kathleen O'Meara")</script>, the novelist, biographer, and Roman Catholic writer.<br>
