<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corri family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1770&#150;1860), <span class="occ">musicians</span>, were of Italian descent but settled in Britain, Ireland, and the USA and were particularly influential as music teachers and writers of teaching material.<br>
<br>The senior member was <a name="cosubject_6349"></a><span class="headword">Domenico Corri</span>  (1746&#150;1825), <span class="occ">composer, music publisher, and teacher</span>, born in Rome on 4 October 1746. His father, a confectioner, was employed in the palace of Cardinal Portocarero and sent Domenico, who showed early musical promise, for violin and singing lessons. By the age of ten the boy was performing in Roman theatre bands, although the cardinal took him under his wing and set about turning him away from music in favour of the church. His (rather covert) musical studies did continue, however, up to the cardinal's death. He then began harpsichord and composition lessons, put on private concerts (attended by Muzio Clementi), and, at his parents' expense, eventually boarded with and received tuition from the famous composer and singing teacher Nicola Porpora in Naples between 1763 and 1767. Following his teacher's demise Domenico returned to Rome, where he conducted concerts for the Roman and visiting British nobility. He lived for two years with the exiled pretender to the British throne, Charles Edward Stuart, who was also an amateur cellist. His opera <span class="italic">La raminga fedele</span> (now lost) appeared in 1770, and in September of that year Dr Charles Burney heard performances in Rome given by Corri and the miniaturist and soprano Alice Bacchelli (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1800), a former pupil of Corri. The result of this encounter and the highly favourable impression made on Burney (relayed in his writings) was an invitation to them both from the music society of Edinburgh to perform at the St Cecilia's Hall concerts there as conductor and singer respectively. By the time this invitation had arrived they were married, and so they travelled to Edinburgh together, arriving in August 1771. They were warmly welcomed and an initial three-year contract became the beginning of an eighteen-year stay in the city. There was a sojourn to London when Domenico's opera <span class="italic">Alessandro nell' Indie</span> was given at the King's Theatre in 1774 (with his friend and former fellow pupil Venanzio Rauzzini making his d&eacute;but in the title role). It enjoyed some success, but according to Burney the &#145;young composer of genius&#146; and his work did not receive the attention they deserved  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.880). His wife performed in high-profile concerts at the new Hanover Square Rooms and elsewhere at this time. Back in Edinburgh, Domenico, now a successful performer and singing-master, took on risky managerial posts, including appointments at the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens and the Theatre Royal, which resulted in financial disaster. Not to be deterred in an expanding market for music, he moved into publishing about 1779, setting up business in Bridge Street with his brother Natale Corri (1765&#150;1822) and using the name of his eldest son, John (or Giovanni). Natale had been a singing teacher, guitarist, and composer in Rome, and may have travelled from Italy with his brother in 1771. He established himself in Edinburgh as a concert promoter as well as a practical musician and married one of the artists he promoted, the soprano Camilla Giolivetti, on 19 February 1794. Despite financial troubles about the turn of the century, Natale remained in business in Edinburgh until he travelled to the continent with his daughters in 1821. His own works included three keyboard sonatas with, as was common at the time, violin accompaniment (1790?), <span class="italic">Scales for Practice and Fingering the Piano forte</span> (<i>c</i>.1815), and various arrangements of popular works.<br>
<br>About 1780 Domenico and his brother were joined by James Sutherland, and the firm Corri and Sutherland survived until Sutherland's death a decade later. Domenico published his harpsichord tutor (advocating scale practice) in 1784 and <span class="italic">A Complete Musical Grammar</span> three years later; both later appeared in modified versions. Natale took over the Scottish business, Corri &amp; Co., when the Corris returned to and settled in London about 1790; there they entertained and enjoyed the company of the city's most eminent musical figures and visitors, including Dr Burney, Joseph Haydn, and, later, John Braham. Domenico continued to publish music in Soho, concentrating, as in Edinburgh, on songs and operatic numbers published both separately and in various collections (many bear the prince of Wales's feathers as a mark and appeared in association with the Edinburgh firm). As well as canzonettas by Haydn, four volumes of <span class="italic">A Select Collection of the most Admired Songs, Duetts</span>, arranged and edited by Corri and dedicated to Queen Charlotte, were published in Edinburgh and London between <i>c</i>.1779 and 1795. These were pioneering for British publications in providing written-out accompaniments rather than just a shorthand &#145;figured&#146; bass. The collections (along with his writings) also provide useful information on contemporary vocal and keyboard performance practices, including ornamentation. Signora Corri appeared in Johann Peter Salomon's concerts in 1792 but may have retired soon afterwards. In 1794 the Corris were living together at 67 Dean Street, Soho, where Domenico established a publishing firm in partnership with his son-in-law, the acclaimed pianist and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67135/', "Jan Ladislav Dussek (1760&#150;1812)")</script>. The firm Corri, Dussek &amp; Co. also acted as agent for Broadwood's piano firm in Scotland (Dussek was intimately involved with Broadwood's extension of the piano keyboard) and appears to have thrived for a time, including Lorenzo da Ponte (Mozart's librettist) among its associates and investors. The German-born composer Ignace Pleyel too appears to have been connected in some way, judging by <span class="italic">Pleyel, Corri &amp; Dussek's Musical Journal</span>, published by Corri, Dussek &amp; Co. in London and Edinburgh (1797). Many of Dussek's works were printed by the firm. However, financial difficulties intervened once more, and towards the end of 1799 Dussek's debts prompted him to flee to Hamburg or Paris. Domenico was gaoled for a short time at Newgate prison as a result of the first of several bankruptcies, but managed to carry on the business alone; it was based at 28 Haymarket from about 1801 to 1804, when his son <a href="#cosubject_69598">Montague [<i>see below</i>]</a> took over. Corri's wife had died some time previously (the family's move from Scotland was partly due to her poor health), and he remarried on 3 April 1803 at St Martin-in-the-Fields. His second wife, Alice Henley, was an English music teacher. Domenico had earlier written a <span class="italic">Musical Dictionary</span> (1798), had composed and published a piano concerto (1800) and keyboard sonatas, including some with &#145;tambourine accompaniment&#146;  (Ward Jones and others), and had contributed a &#145;Bird Song&#146; to Charles Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span> (1802). His five-act opera <span class="italic">The Travellers</span> was finally produced at Drury Lane in January 1806, following a long delay as a result of apparent reservations on the part of theatre impresarios (the work was conceived shortly after he had arrived in London). This has been attributed in part to the &#145;pseudo-Oriental&#146;  (ibid.) music used to accompany scenes set in China and Turkey that broke with his generally conservative, <i>galant</i> style. Domenico composed and taught (his pupils included the composer Isaac Nathan) for another decade or so before a decline in his health. His later compositions for the stage include music for the operatic farce <span class="italic">In and out of Tune</span> (1808), including the quartet &#145;Past Ten O'Clock&#146;, and for David Garrick's play <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> (1808). He continued to write for the keyboard (completing twenty-one sonatas in all) and to edit collections including a volume of hymns and psalms (<i>c</i>.1820). <span class="italic">The Singer's Preceptor</span> (1810), an important guide to the art of performance, also features Corri's autobiography to that date. He was &#145;subject to fits of insanity during the last six months of his life&#146;  (ibid.) and died in Hampstead, London, on 22 May 1825. Lorenzo da Ponte, rueful of his disastrous involvement with Corri's business (which caused a loss of 1000 guineas), questioned both his business acumen and honesty. His most enduring contribution remains his legacy as a pedagogue and writer.<br>
<br>The singer and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8330/', "Sophia Justina Dussek (1775&#150;1847)")</script> was Corri's daughter.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69597"></a><span class="headword">(Philip) Antony Corri</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Arthur Clifton]</span>  (1784?&#150;1832), <span class="occ">music teacher, singer, and composer</span>, was a son of Domenico Corri and was born in Edinburgh. He made his name in London during the early part of the nineteenth century as a composer of songs and piano pieces and a teacher of lady amateurs. It was entirely natural therefore that he should produce duets for piano or piano and harp and a piano tutor, <span class="italic">L'anima di musica</span> (1810), one of the most comprehensive of the time. The latter was reissued in 1822, and a popular abridged version, <span class="italic">Original System of Preluding</span>, appeared about 1812 and was itself reprinted on several occasions. His other piano works include a sonata, with violin accompaniment, entitled <span class="italic">La morte di Dussek</span> (1812). Corri is also well known as a principal figure (along with Johann Baptist Cramer, William Dance, William Ayrton, and Charles Neate) in the founding of London's Philharmonic Society in 1813, at which time he was resident at 9 Portman Place, Paddington. His high standing within the society, as a singer as well as a composer, came to an abrupt end in December 1816 when, having &#145;made off with someone's wife&#146;  (Ehrlich), he was expelled in disgrace. He was also director of the Professional Concert at this time. He then emigrated to the USA, appearing in New York and Philadelphia and arriving in Baltimore towards the end of 1817. He was baptized there as Arthur Clifton on 31 December 1817 and married Alphonsa Elizabeth Ringgold the next day. Positions as organist and choirmaster at diverse churches (the First Presbyterian Church, 1818&#150;23, and the First Independent Church, 1823&#150;31) were complemented by teaching, performance, and theatre productions. He published compositions in Baltimore, including songs, pieces for piano, and a ballad opera (with Italianate elements), <span class="italic">The Enterprise, or, Love and Pleasure</span> (1822). He appears to have charmed his way back onto the Philharmonic platform under his own name at some point, but died in Baltimore on 19 February 1832.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69598"></a><span class="headword">Montague Philip Corri</span>  (<em>c.</em>1784&#150;1849), <span class="occ">music publisher and composer</span>, was born in Edinburgh, another son of Domenico Corri and possibly the twin brother of Philip Antony Corri. He initially chose painting and fencing (at which he became expert by the age of ten under the guidance of Domenico Angelo) over music and, perhaps as a reaction against family pressure, spent a period at sea. Music appealed to him a great deal more when he was about eighteen, and he mainly taught himself despite a few lessons from his father, Peter Winter, and Daniel Steibelt. In 1804 he took over his father's business which operated in association with various other traders until a new firm called Corri &amp; Co. broke away. This published <span class="italic">The Library Newspaper &amp; Musical Journal</span> in 1806, while based at 13 Oxendon Street, and about 1807 was located for a short time in Little Newport Street. The music dealership became bankrupt in 1811. Montague's instrumental career was also curtailed as the result of an accident which left one of his fingers dislocated. This may, however, have been to his long-term advantage, as he became a successful composer and arranger for the theatre and military bands, famous for the speed at which he could work under pressure. His work included music for plays and pantomimes at the Surrey, Astley's, and Cobourg theatres and the English Opera House (1812&#150;14), written in collaboration with John Braham, Charles Edward Horn, and others. After a season as chorus master at the English Opera House (1816&#150;17) he was employed for a short time by his uncle Natale Corri as manager of the Pantheon in Edinburgh. From then on he appears to have led a fairly itinerant lifestyle, living and working (in the theatre and as a fencing instructor) in Manchester, Liverpool, and Newcastle. He continued to compose songs and keyboard pieces, including numerous arrangements for piano solo and duet, and published a singing treatise (<i>c</i>.1830), a piano tutor (1835?), and, perhaps most interestingly, <span class="italic">A Complete Course of Instructions on &hellip; Arranging Music</span> (1835?). The story that Montague was shipwrecked during a voyage from Shields to London, losing everything, attributed to Brown and Stratton by <span class="italic">New Grove</span>, was first recorded by Sainsbury. He died in London on 19 September 1849. He was the father of William Charles Cunningham Corri (1834/5&#150;1893), a song composer who was the father of Charles Montague Corri (1861&#150;1941), an opera conductor at the Old Vic Theatre, London; Clarence Collingwood Corri (1863&#150;1918), a composer principally of songs and operettas; and William Corri (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1865, <i>d</i>. after 1905), also a song composer.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69599"></a><span class="headword">Haydn Corri</span>  (1785&#150;1860), <span class="occ">pianist, organist, and composer</span>, was born in Edinburgh, a son of Domenico Corri. He presumably received keyboard lessons from his father from an early age. He established himself as an instrumentalist and travelled from London to Ireland in 1811 and in 1819&#150;20 as an accompanist to Italian opera singers performing at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin. He married the soprano Ann Adams (Adami) (1800&#150;1867) in London on 15 July 1814, and they both settled in Dublin in 1821. She was employed as a singer at the new Theatre Royal, Hawkins Street, and he became an important figure in the musical life of Dublin. A popular keyboard and singing teacher (his <span class="italic">The Delivery of Vocal Music Simplified</span> appeared in 1826), he became organist and choirmaster of St Mary's, the pro-cathedral in Marlborough Street, in 1827, and retained the post until 1848. His compositions include sacred works for performance there, along with the staple fare of songs and arrangements. An adaptation of Cherubini's mass in A (originally composed in 1825 for the coronation of Charles X of France), for organ or piano with an added fourth voice part, was published about 1855. Haydn Corri died in Dublin on 12 February 1860. He was the father of two musicians: Patrick Anthony Corri (1820&#150;1876), a singer, conductor, and composer and the father of the baritone Haydn Woulds Corri (1845&#150;1876); and Henry Corri (1822&#150;1888), a bass and conductor and the father of Ghita Auber Corri (1869/70&#150;1937), a song composer and singer in the Carl Rosa Opera Company who married the playwright Richard Neville Lynn in 1899.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69601"></a><span class="headword">Frances <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span> Corri <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em> Corri-Paltoni]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>1791/2, <em>d.</em> 1861), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born in Edinburgh, one of the daughters of Natale and Camilla Corri. After singing lessons from her father she went to London for instruction from John Braham and Angelica Catalani. Frances embarked on a continental tour (1815&#150;16) with Catalani, and her powerful singing style, along with impeccable intonation, was said to resemble closely that of the Italian soprano. Back in London, her King's Theatre d&eacute;but (17 January 1818), as the Countess in Mozart's <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>, was a great success. Further engagements there and with the Philharmonic Society followed until she, along with her father and sisters, left for the continent in 1821. From Munich she travelled to Italy, where she settled and married the singer Giuseppe Paltoni (<i>d</i>. 1856). She gave performances in Milan at La Scala (1828&#150;9) and toured widely and successfully, visiting Spain, Germany, and Russia. A performance of Bellini's <span class="italic">Norma</span> at Alessandria (1835) featured her last known appearance. She later resided with her family at Chorlton upon Medlock, Lancashire, where she was described as a &#145;professor of singing&#146;  (census, 1851). Frances Corri-Paltoni died aged 69 on 13 July 1861 at 16 Peel Terrace, Stretford, Lancashire.<br>
<br>Among Natale's and Camilla's other daughters, little is known of the soprano Angelina Corri. Rosalie Corri (1803&#150;<i>c</i>.1860), also a soprano, was taught by Rovedino; she sang alongside Frances in London at the King's Theatre and performed in Irish premi&egrave;res of Mozart operas in Dublin under the direction of Haydn Corri in 1819. She continued to perform in London, where she married William Geeson in 1825, and also appeared in Milan at the Teatro Re (1823). A charity concert was staged for the sisters in London in 1823, a year after their father's death  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
