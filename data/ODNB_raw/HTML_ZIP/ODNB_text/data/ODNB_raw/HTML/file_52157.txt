<span class="headword">Verzelini,  Jacob</span>  (1522&#150;1607), <span class="occ">glass maker</span>, was born in Venice, probably into a family already engaged in the glass trade; a brother, Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1604), was active in Li&egrave;ge and London; another brother, Jasper, remained in Venice. Verzelini went to Antwerp about 1549. His marriage there in September 1556 to Elizabeth van Buren, daughter of a rich merchant, brought six children, and with this family he arrived in London in 1565, residing thereafter in the parish of St Olave, Hart Street. In 1571 Verzelini was recorded as a broker, probably trading with Antwerp, but in December 1574 he received a licence to set up a glasshouse and to manufacture drinking glasses as made in Murano. The glass, known as &#145;crystal&#146;, or &#145;fa&ccedil;on de venise&#146;, was made from crushed flint and soda in the form of ashes imported from Spain, decoloured by the addition of manganese. A group of Venetians had arrived from Antwerp in 1549 to set up a crystal drinking-glass manufactory near Belsize Palace, north of London, but within a year or two all had left England. The import from Venice of vessels and mirrors of crystal for the luxury market represented for the government an unwelcome outflow of capital, and Verzelini's grant included the monopoly of manufacture for twenty-one years, with a general prohibition of imports of crystal wares.<br>
<br>The glasshouse was constructed within the premises formerly occupied by the Crutched Friars, in Hart Street, and manned by Italians and some Englishmen, to whom Verzelini's grant obliged him to teach this new craft. The shopkeepers who had hitherto imported glassware opposed Verzelini's monopoly, but to no avail; however, it may not have been coincidence that in the morning of 4 September 1575 his glasshouse was devastated by fire, fed by his adjacent store of firewood. Fortunately the fire was prevented from spreading by the outer stone walls. Verzelini operated a temporary glasshouse at Newgate, and rebuilt the Crutched Friars glasshouse, together with a spacious house for his family. He was granted denization on 26 November 1576, and shortly afterwards, in consideration of the damage at Crutched Friars, was granted a twenty-one-year lease allowing him to cut firewood on the royal estate of Kingswood, in Hampshire.<br>
<br>A succession of problems hit Verzelini in 1579. During the summer one of his servants brought charges that after three years of sexual abuse she had become pregnant by him. Having confessed, he was ordered to give 200 ells of canvas to the Bridewell Hospital poor and to have the child raised at his expense. Then Verzelini, who was not a freeman of the City and therefore prevented from trading with other &#145;foreigners&#146;, was penalized for selling to a trader from Leicester. He was ordered to demolish the glasshouse at Newgate when that at Crutched Friars was rebuilt, and he was ordered to shut down his furnaces in the winter, so as to spare some firewood for the citizenry. A demise of the Crutched Friars premises to Verzelini by Lord and Lady Lumley in 1586, for twenty-one years for a consideration of &pound;200 and annual rent of &pound;33 10<i>s</i>., mentions the great room enclosing the glasshouse, a hall or shop, with parlour and kitchen, a garden with further buildings, a house, a tennis court, and other buildings occupied by a third party.<br>
<br>It is often impossible to distinguish between crystalware produced in England and in the Low Countries at this time, but twelve pieces originating in England are ascribed to Verzelini, on the grounds that he had the monopoly at the time. Most are diamond-point engraved commemorative goblets created to celebrate a marriage or baptism. The British Museum has a clear cylindrical tankard, with decorated silver-gilt lid and base, made for Lord Burghley about 1572&#150;4, and a goblet, inscribed &#145;1577&#146;, the earliest dated example of any English glass. Two goblets, engraved respectively &#145;John Dier 1581&#146; and &#145;RP MP&#146;, &#145;1586 GOD SAVE QUYNE ELISABETH&#146;, are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Others are in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Birmingham Museum, and in the USA. The diamond-point engraved decoration, with foliage and animals, initials, and dates, is in a linear style with hatching, an Italian style which was then copied in England. The engraver was possibly Anthony de Lysle, a Frenchman resident in London who worked independently of Verzelini's workshop. Verzelini's output must have been considerable. He kept his glassworks in operation for over twenty-one years, creating a flourishing industry and a body of craftsmen trained in the Venetian tradition. It was also profitable, for he acquired property in nearby Mark Lane, and, over the years, estates in and around Downe, Kent, where he became lord of the manor.<br>
<br>Verzelini probably retired about 1590; his wife was naturalized that year, which would enable her to inherit land. The glasshouse was handed over to his sons Francis and Jacob. Meanwhile, however, a patent to make crystal was granted in February 1592 to Sir Jerome Bowers, soldier and courtier, as a reward for loyalty, to take effect on the termination of Verzelini's grant in 1595. Bowers had no knowledge of glass making, but he built a glasshouse in the former Blackfriars monastery and endeavoured to recruit Verzelini's Italian craftsmen. The feud between the Verzelinis and Bowers carried over into the courts with a victory for Bowers. The Crutched Friars glasshouse closed down, although Jacob and Elizabeth Verzelini continued to live there. Francis was imprisoned for ten years from 1598, his brother Jacob for a lesser period: the exact nature of their offences is not known.<br>
<br>Verzelini died at his house in Crutched Friars on 20 January 1607, and was buried, as he desired, at Downe Chapel on 3 February. His will, drawn up in 1604, benefited the poor in Christ's, St Bartholomew's, and St Thomas's hospitals, and his parishes of St Olave and Downe. One of his children had probably died young, but his daughters, Katherine (now dead), Elizabeth, and Mary, had all made good marriages; they and their children, and his sons, inherited the properties in Kent. His wife was chief beneficiary and executor, but before the will was proved she died, on 26 October 1607, and was likewise buried at Downe.<br>
