<span class="headword">Bunbury, Sir  Edward Herbert</span>, ninth baronet  (1811&#150;1895), <span class="occ">classical scholar and author</span>, was born on 8 July 1811 at Brighton, second of the six children (five sons followed by a daughter who died aged one) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3936/', "Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Edward Bunbury, seventh baronet (1778&#150;1860)")</script>, of Mildenhall and Barton Hall in Suffolk, and his first wife, Louisa Emilia (1788?&#150;1828), daughter of General Henry Edward Fox (1755&#150;1811). The family was a landed one renowned, as <span class="italic">The Times</span> (8 March 1895) said, for its &#145;brilliant social qualities and influential connexions&#146;, as well as for its art collection at Barton. Edward and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38298/', "Charles James Fox Bunbury (1809&#150;1886)")</script>, were educated at home. The climax of the enlightened curriculum was an extended visit to Europe in 1827&#150;9:<blockquote>Sir Edward's youthful memories were a changing kaleidoscope of rounds of Court gaiety, enlivened by an occasional <i>&eacute;meute</i>, of perils by flood and troubles at custom-houses; of the gems of art and the glimpses of scenery, of vessels stormbound by contrary winds, and of running the gauntlet of Salvator-like gorges, picketed by troops and ambushed by brigands. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>Bunbury matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1829, and graduated as senior classic and chancellor's medallist in 1833; election to a fellowship followed in 1835. In 1833, however, he was admitted at the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar in 1841. From 1847 to 1852 he sat as Liberal MP for Bury St Edmunds, but both his attempts at re-election (in 1852 and 1868) proved unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Bunbury's obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> characterizes him as &#145;shy, self-contained, and almost painfully embarrassed in manner&#146;. Perhaps the shyness amounted to little more than an aversion to small talk, because the writer goes on to remark that:<blockquote>his marvellous memory never failed him. As he got animated and excited he would gasp in his talk, and incident and reminiscence would crowd fast on each other, till he was almost apt to lose himself in a labyrinth of entertaining digressions.</blockquote>Sir Clements Markham likewise described him as &#145;exceedingly fond of society, and in his later years he was a constant frequenter of the Athenaeum, where he enjoyed meeting and conversing with his numerous friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 499). He was noted for his grasp of disciplines as diverse as art, astronomy, and numismatics. He contributed occasionally to the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and produced a revised edition (1846) of Sir William Gell's <span class="italic">Topography of Rome and its Vicinity</span>.<br>
<br>But Bunbury's most important work matched his classical training with his enthusiasm for geography and travel. As early as 9 December 1839 he was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and served on its council in 1846&#150;7. It must have been from the 1840s that he became one of William Smith's principal collaborators in the preparation of his great classical dictionaries for John Murray&#151;of geography above all. Bunbury's contributions were praised by E. A. Freeman and others as &#145;models of accuracy and of exhaustive erudition&#146;  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 499). This work laid the foundation for his major piece of scholarship and principal claim to fame, <span class="italic">A History of Ancient Geography among the Greeks and Romans from the Earliest Ages till the Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. Twelve years in the making, it runs to more than 1400 pages and was published in two volumes by John Murray in 1879, with a second edition following in 1883 and a reprint by Dover in 1959. Bunbury wrote to Murray from 35 St James's Street, his London residence, on 16 September 1878:<blockquote>I am fully aware that my work is not likely to be a pecuniary success and shall be quite satisfied for my own part if it proves as you express it a credit both to author and publisher. I need hardly add that I feel much gratified by the favourable opinion expressed by your referee.</blockquote>Posterity has shared that opinion. As a thorough, balanced exposition of its challenging and fundamental subject, Bunbury's work remains unmatched in any language. It earned him a medal from the Royal Geographical Society in 1880, and continued to be cited as standard for a century.<br>
<br>Bunbury succeeded his brother as ninth baronet on 18 June 1886. He died unmarried at Apsley House, 148 King's Road, Brighton, from pneumonia on 5 March 1895, and was buried at Great Barton in Suffolk. His library and collection of Greek coins were sold at Sothebys in 1896.<br>
