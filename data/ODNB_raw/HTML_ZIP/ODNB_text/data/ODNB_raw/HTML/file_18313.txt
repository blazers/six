<span class="headword">Master,  Thomas</span>  (1602/3&#150;1643), <span class="occ">poet and amanuensis</span>, was born in Coates, Gloucestershire, where his father, William Master (<i>d</i>. in or after 1637), was rector. He studied under Henry Topp at Cirencester grammar school and in 1617 advanced to Winchester College on a scholarship. He was nineteen on 15 November 1622 when he matriculated from New College, Oxford; he was named perpetual fellow before graduating BA on 22 November 1625. He proceeded MA on 6 June 1629. According to Anthony Wood, he &#145;was esteemed a vast scholar, a general artist and linguist, a noted poet, and a most florid preacher&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.84).<br>
<br>Master contributed Latin and English poems to no fewer than ten Oxford University collections, including <span class="italic">Carolus redux</span> (1623), <span class="italic">Musarum Oxoniensium</span> (1633), and <span class="italic">Horti Carolini rosa altera</span> (1640). Some of this poetry is substantial, such as &#145;Oceani convivium&#146; in <span class="italic">Britanniae natalis</span> (1630). Wood mentions three poems not included in any of these collections: &#145;On Bishop Lake&#146; (1626), &#145;On Ben Jonson&#146; (1637), and &#145;On Vaulx&#146;. Master is the author of a Greek ode, dated 19 April 1633, on the crucifixion. It was first published as an appendix to Sir Henry Saville's <span class="italic">Oratio</span> (1658), along with a Latin translation by Henry Jacobs, and an English translation, entitled &#145;Christs passion&#146;, by Abraham Cowley.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Master served as an amanuensis to Edward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and according to John Aubrey he lived with Herbert until 1642. The Bodleian Library holds four manuscript volumes related to Herbert's <span class="italic">The Life and Raigne of King Henry the Eighth</span>. The first three volumes (Jesus College MSS 71&#150;73) are original drafts, partly in Master's handwriting, of the three-volume printed work. A fourth volume (Jesus College MS 74) comprises research notes in Master's hand and &#145;is dated internally to 1635&#150;1638&#146;  (Hoyle, 54). Wood suggests that Master translated several of Herbert's books into Latin, but this has not been confirmed. At Herbert's request in 1636 Master composed a Latin poem, <span class="italic">Mensa lubrica</span>, on the game of shuffleboard. It was published in 1651 and republished, with an English version entitled &#145;The shovel-board table turn'd&#146;, as an appendix to Saville's <span class="italic">Oratio</span>.<br>
<br>In August 1637 Master travelled from Montgomeryshire to Lincolnshire to be inducted into the sinecure living of East Wickham, near Louth. He recounts his journey in a Latin letter to his father, dated 25 September 1637. He apparently became ill near Lincoln and had to stay briefly with his uncle at Stockwith before attending the ceremony and returning to Montgomeryshire. Written in prose and verse, the letter was later edited by his travelling companion George Ent and published as <span class="italic">Iter boreale</span> (1675).<br>
<br>Shortly after receiving his BD, on 25 March 1641 Master preached an English sermon on <span class="roman">Luke</span> 1: 26&#150;7 at New College. It was later published as <span class="italic">The Virgin Mary</span> (1665) and achieved some measure of popularity, with reprints in sermon collections throughout the eighteenth century. On 19 March 1642 Viscount Newark wrote to the bishop of London to recommend Master for an ecclesiastical preferment. There is no evidence, however, that his petition was successful. About a week later, in the chapel of New College, Master delivered a Latin oration on the British monarchy, surveying the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I and concluding with praise of Charles I. The oration was later edited by the history professor John Lamphire of New College and published as <span class="italic">Monarchia Britannica</span> (1661).<br>
<br>According to Wood, Master died &#145;either in Dec. or Jan. in sixteen hundred forty three&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3. 86), having succumbed to the so-called Oxford camp disease, but the date of Master's death is probably closer to 31 August 1643: his replacement at New College, Thomas Brickenden, was admitted as a scholar on 9 September. Master may have died in Oxford or at Louth, but is said to have been buried in 1643 in the north part of the outer chapel of New College. Edward Herbert's <span class="italic">Occasional Verses</span> (1648) concludes with a poem dedicated to Master and a Latin epitaph on &#145;Amate Master&#146;.<br>
