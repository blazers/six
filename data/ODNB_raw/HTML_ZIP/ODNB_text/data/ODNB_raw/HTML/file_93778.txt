<span class="headword">Shulman,  Milton</span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">theatre critic and writer</span>, was born on 30 August 1913 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Samuel Shulman (<i>d</i>. 1919), shopkeeper, and his wife, Ethel. His parents were both Orthodox Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute;s from the Ukraine who moved to Canada several years before their son's birth. He was educated at Harbord Collegiate Institute and Toronto University, which he paid for by working as a nightclub singer under the name Whispering Milt. Having studied law, from 1937 he practised as a barrister before joining the <span class="italic">Toronto Star</span> as a reporter. From 1940 he served in Europe, initially in the Canadian armoured corps and then with Canadian intelligence, rising to the rank of major; he was mentioned in dispatches following the Normandy landings and after the war was among those responsible for interrogating high-ranking German officers. In 1947 he published <span class="italic">Defeat in the West</span>, the first book to tell the story of the war, and of Germany's defeat, from the German perspective. The book proved very popular, selling 10,000 copies.<br>
<br>On leaving the army Shulman was drawn to London, in part due to its many theatres. In 1947 he began work on the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> as a feature writer and on the paper's &#145;Londoner's Diary&#146;, for which he interviewed numerous actors. A year later he was appointed film critic of the <span class="italic">Standard</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> by the paper's owner, Lord Beaverbrook, a fellow Canadian who had read and been impressed by <span class="italic">Defeat in the West</span>. Shulman proved successful in this role, though his criticism of the quality of many Hollywood productions offended the American film companies who in 1953 withdrew their advertising in the <span class="italic">Standard</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, at an estimated cost to the papers of &pound;250,000. Shulman boasted that he was Lord Beaverbrook's &pound;5000-a-week critic. The proprietor stood firm and the principle of the critic's independence was preserved.<br>
<br>In 1953, on Beaverbrook's instruction, Shulman succeeded Kenneth Tynan as the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>'s drama critic. Over the next thirty-eight years he provided reviews of more than 5000 productions for the paper. He was seldom inspired by what he saw and claimed that during his entire period as the paper's drama critic not one great play had been premiered. He considered this unsurprising given the absence, in his opinion, of a single good play in the 140 years between Richard Sheridan and Oscar Wilde. Notable targets for his criticism included the complete work of Brecht; the wilful obscurity of Beckett's <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span> (best suited for &#145;those who prefer to have their clich&eacute;s masquerading as epigrams&#146;); the &#145;self-pitying snivel&#146; of John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>, and what he considered the inaccurate depiction of working-class society in Shelagh Delaney's <span class="italic">A Taste of Honey</span>, which he declared as true to Lancashire life as &#145;anything ever written by Ivor Novello on Ruritania&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 25 May 2004). In truth Shulman was not best placed to judge, being a committed Londoner who went to Stratford upon Avon only with great reluctance. Other targets included stage adaptations of Agatha Christie&#151;the popularity of which he bemoaned and sought to undermine by on one occasion disclosing the murderer's identity&#151;and the work of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose <span class="italic">Cats</span> was threatened on the first night by a bomb scare which left Shulman unperturbed: &#145;This theatre's never had a hit yet&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 24 May 2004). At the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> he regarded himself as a reporter rather than a critic, whose responsibility was to analyse a production for the ordinary man or woman in the street&#151;a role that led him to be described as more a people's critic than a critic's critic. He was remarkably diligent in this pursuit of an evening of good entertainment and relayed his findings to a metropolitan readership with clarity, sense, and concision.<br>
<br>In his youth Shulman had been a keen ladies' man and wrote a series of columns entitled &#145;Shulman's Beauties&#146;. He was married briefly in Canada at the outbreak of the war. On 16 June 1956 he married his second wife, Drusilla Norman Beyfus, journalist and writer, and daughter of Norman Beyfus, writer. Their witnesses at the ceremony at Westminster register office were the Labour politician Michael Foot and his wife, Jill Craigie. With his second wife Shulman had one son, Jason, a designer and editor, and two daughters, Alexandra, who became editor of British <span class="italic">Vogue</span> in 1992, and Nicola (from 1990 marchioness of Normanby), a writer and critic.<br>
<br>Between 1958 and 1962 Shulman was an executive producer at Granada TV and then for two years assistant controller of programmes at Rediffusion. In these years he produced programmes such as <span class="italic">Decision</span> and <span class="italic">Here and Now</span>, and devised for Granada the notably unsuccessful <span class="italic">Challenge</span>, where panellists were asked their candid opinion of a guest. <span class="italic">Challenge</span> ended soon after the programme's first subject, Randolph Churchill, had received a thorough grilling. Between 1964 and 1973 Shulman was television critic of the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> and in 1967 he was voted critic of the year for his column &#145;Inside TV&#146;. By the early 1970s he had become disillusioned with the quality of BBC television compared with BBC radio and drew links between modern programming trends on Granada and the rise of violent crime in Britain. It was a theme he pursued in his books <span class="italic">The Ravenous Eye</span> and <span class="italic">The Least Worst Television in the World</span> (both 1973). From 1972 Shulman appeared regularly on Radio 4's <span class="italic">Stop the Week</span>, hosted by Robert Robinson, where he became a pontificator and teller of Jewish jokes. He published books throughout his time as a critic, including several for children and a memoir, <span class="italic">Marilyn, Hitler and Me</span> (1998); during the mid-1970s he also wrote a column for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and was film critic of <span class="italic">Vogue</span> for twelve years from 1975. He retired as the <span class="italic">Standard</span>'s theatre critic in 1991 though he continued as an occasional columnist until 1996.<br>
<br>Shulman was a keen tennis player at the Hurlingham Club, Fulham. He was always competitive and was particularly proud of having won one game when he played a set against Jaroslav Drobn&yacute;, then Wimbledon champion. He also collected modern art and had a shrewd eye for the investment value of a picture. On one occasion he decided to sell an impressive Lowry and, having taken the picture to a dealer in Bruton Street, spent some time haggling over the price. With no agreement, he left the shop but was followed by the dealer who finally agreed his terms. Shulman asked what he would re-sell the painting for and was told laconically, &#145;You couldn't afford it&#146;  (private information). He was notably unsuccessful in another favourite diversion, gambling on horses, and in 1975 took his bookmaker to court for claiming that he had defaulted on his debts. Represented by the Conservative politician Leon Brittan, Shulman maintained that he had paid for his bets with postdated cheques, and won his case.<br>
<br>Shulman died on 21 May 2004 at his home, 51 Eaton Square, Westminster, from kidney failure. He was survived by his wife, Drusilla, and their three children, whose success was a deep satisfaction to him. After his cremation, Shulman's son, Jason, wrapped some of his ashes in pages of the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, attached them to a rocket, and fired them over his father's bookmaker's premises in London; he used another batch to create an art work entitled <span class="italic">A Piece of My Father</span>, exhibited at the Madder Rose gallery in east London in 2006.<br>
