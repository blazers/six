<span class="headword">Mansfield,  Charles Blachford</span>  (1819&#150;1855), <span class="occ">chemist and traveller</span>, was born on 8 May 1819 at Rowner, near Gosport, Hampshire, the son of John Mansfield, rector at Rowner, and Winifred, eldest daughter of Robert Pope Blachford of Osborne House, Isle of Wight. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34863/', "Robert Blachford Mansfield (1824&#150;1908)")</script> became a sportsman and barrister. Although they lived comfortably, the Mansfields do not seem to have been a happy family. Charles Mansfield was educated first at a private school at Twyford, and afterwards at Winchester College (1831&#150;5), which he detested. At the age of sixteen his health broke down from what seems to have been poliomyelitis, which left him partially deaf and with a stiff arm. In consequence he passed a year with a private tutor in Northamptonshire, where his scientific interests were encouraged by the marquess of Northampton, a council member of the Royal Society. On 23 November 1836 he entered his name at Clare College, Cambridge, but was unable to take up residence until October 1839. Owing to frequent absences due to ill health, and intellectual and social diversions he did not graduate BA until 1846, then MA in 1849. During these years, he read widely and through his charisma rapidly gathered many friends around him. With <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15617/', "Charles Kingsley")</script>, who was a contemporary at Cambridge, Mansfield formed a lifelong friendship. Only gradually did such friends learn of Mansfield's secret life, and how to help him during periodic bouts of melancholic depression. Despite earlier illness he had grown into a handsome, athletic young man who easily attracted the opposite sex. On 3 February 1842 he secretly married a widow, Catherine Shafto, daughter of a London merchant, William Warne Higgs, but they separated immediately. He was never able to divorce her and had many love affairs.<br>
<br>A medical career attracted Mansfield for a time, and while still at Cambridge he attended some classes at St George's Hospital in London. However, when he settled in London in 1846 he decided to devote himself to chemistry, while occupying his leisure with a diversity of interests ranging from natural history and mesmerism (he hypnotized Kingsley during the composition of <span class="italic">Yeast</span>), to abstruse studies in medieval science. Chemistry, he decided, was the central science for a system of quasi-Platonic knowledge that he had already worked out for himself, whose aim would be &#145;the comprehension of the harmonious plan or order on which the universe is constructed&#151;an order on which rests the belief that the universe is truly a representation to <i>our</i> ideas of a Divine Idea, and is in fact a visible symbol of thoughts working in a mind infinitely wise and good&#146;  (C. B. Mansfield, <span class="italic">A Theory of Salts</span>, 1865, ix).<br>
<br>In 1848, after completing the chemistry course at the Royal College of Chemistry, Mansfield undertook, at the request of its director, A. W. Hofmann, a series of experiments which resulted in the fractional distillation of impure benzene, toluene, and xylene from coal tar, and the development of procedures for the large-scale conversion of benzene into nitrobenzene. In premises in Hanover Square, close to the Royal College of Chemistry, he manufactured aniline for Hofmann's researches and helped him prepare scientific papers and reports. The extraction method, which he patented in May 1848 (no. 11,960), effectively laid the foundation of the European coal tar and dyestuffs industries though others were to reap the profits. In 1849 he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Benzole, its Nature and its Utility</span>, to indicate what he foresaw as some of the most important applications of benzene. These included perfuming soaps, urban illumination, surgical plasters, and dry-cleaning.<br>
<br>During the critical cholera years of 1848&#150;9, when Chartism appeared likely to promote political disruption, Mansfield became a Christian socialist, joining J. F. D. Maurice, Kingsley, J. M. Ludlow, Nevil Story Maskelyne, and others in their efforts at social reform among the workmen of London, supporting these efforts financially, and helping to provide pure water for districts like Bermondsey, where every drop was sewage-tainted. He wrote several articles in <span class="italic">Politics for the People</span>, edited by Maurice and Ludlow, and afterwards in the <span class="italic">Christian Socialist</span>, and he was strongly supportive of the group's efforts to create a working men's college in 1854. In September 1850 an account of a balloon inflating machine constructed in Paris led him to investigate aeronautics, and in the next few months (following correspondence with Sir George Cayley), he wrote his <span class="italic">Aerial Navigation</span>, an original and suggestive work that appeared posthumously in 1877. In addition, he published a Utopian fantasy on space travel in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. In the winter of 1851&#150;2 he delivered a Royal Institution lecture course on the chemistry of metals, which apart from remarkable generalizations, contained strange triadic speculations concerning chemical classification which were published posthumously as <span class="italic">A Theory of Salts</span> in 1865, by which time the theory of chemical structure had superseded it.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1852 Mansfield started for Paraguay, partly &#145;to gratify a whim of wishing to see the country, which I believed to be an unspoiled Arcadia&#146;  (C. B. Mansfield, <span class="italic">Paraguay, Brazil and the Plate</span>, 1856, 8), but also to escape a sexual entanglement with a working-class woman that had shocked his Christian socialist friends. He arrived at Buenos Aires in August, and having obtained permission from Urquiza, the leader of the Argentine confederation, to sail up the River Paran&aacute;, he reached Asunci&oacute;n on 24 November, where he remained two and a half months. Paraguay, under Jos&eacute; Francia and his successor Carlos Lopez, had been shut off from the world for forty years, and Mansfield was, if not the first English visitor to the capital, certainly the first to go there merely to take notes. His letters, published after his death, contained bright and careful descriptions of Paraguayan society, the scenery, plant and bird life, and a scheme for the colonization of the Gran Chaco, a dream that remained with him for the remainder of his life. A sketch of the history of Paraguay, valuable for the period immediately preceding and following his arrival, formed the conclusion to his letters. Other letters (all originally addressed to Kingsley, Ludlow, and Maskelyne), printed in the same volume, dealt in a similar manner with Brazil. These were translated into Portuguese by Pascual, and published at Rio de Janeiro together with critical essays on Mansfield's narrative, the first volume in 1861, the second in 1862.<br>
<br>Mansfield returned to England in the spring of 1853, resumed his chemical studies, and began a book on the constitution of salts based upon his Royal Institution lectures. He also took up the study of law in emulation of his brother, and became involved in controversy with the manufacturing chemist F. C. Crace Calvert over the validity of Mansfield's 1848 patent. In his private life he became entangled with Mary Ellen Meredith, the unhappy wife of the writer George Meredith. Meanwhile, Hofmann had invited him to prepare specimens of pure benzene for the Paris Exhibition, and on 17 February 1855, while preparing these in a building he had hired for the purposes by the Regent's Canal, a naphtha still overflowed and a benzene/air mixture explosion occurred. Mansfield, in attempting to save the premises by carrying the blazing still into the street, was horribly burned, and died nine days later on 26 February in the Middlesex Hospital, surrounded by friends. He was buried in Weybridge churchyard. His tragic death, with so many of his talents unfulfilled, affected his friends emotionally for several years to come. Even in death his private life continued to embarrass them, for Mansfield left his fortune to a former lover, a Mrs Burrows, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardiner, even though she had subsequently married another man; she declined the bequest.<br>
<br>Vegetarian, teetotaller, and mesmerist, brilliant conversationalist, and eccentric, Mansfield possessed a personality which dazzled all who fell into his company. His works, published at various intervals after his death by his brother, Kingsley, and Maskelyne, are unfortunately mere fragments to which he had not added the finishing touch, yet each bore the unmistakable impress of a polymathic mind of the highest order. The private testimony of those who knew him well, such as Kingsley, Ludlow, and Maskelyne, confirmed Hofmann's commemoration of Mansfield as &#145;this highly-gifted young chemist and noble-hearted young man. In him science has lost one of its most ardent and most promising cultivators&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of Juries 1862 Exhibition</span>, 123).<br>
