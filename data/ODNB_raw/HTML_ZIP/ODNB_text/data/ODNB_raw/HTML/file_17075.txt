<span class="headword">Low,  Sampson</span>  (1797&#150;1886), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in London in November 1797, the son of Sampson Low (<i>d</i>. 1800), printer and publisher, of Berwick Street, Soho. He served an apprenticeship with Lionel Booth, the proprietor of a circulating library, and, after a few years spent in the house of Longman &amp; Co., began business in 1819 at 42 Lamb's Conduit Street, London, as a bookseller and stationer, with a circulating library attached. His reading-room was frequented by many literary men, lawyers, and politicians. In 1821 Sampson married; his wife's name was Mary (1796/7&#150;1881), and they went on to have several children, among whom his eldest son, Sampson Low jun. (1822&#150;1871), and his second son, William Henry Low (<i>d</i>. 1881), were to assist with the family business.<br>
<br>Until 1837 <span class="italic">Bent's Literary Advertiser</span> was the only trade journal connected with bookselling; at this period the publishers became dissatisfied with the manner in which it was conducted, and established a periodical of their own called the <span class="italic">Publishers' Circular</span>, appointing Low as editor. The first number appeared on 2 October 1837. Low gradually introduced many changes and improvements, and in 1867 the <span class="italic">Circular</span> became his sole property. The periodical, which was published fortnightly, supplied a list of new books, and from these lists an annual catalogue was made up, the first appearing in 1839. Upon these annual catalogues Low based his <span class="italic">British Catalogue</span>, the first volume of which, containing titles under authors' names of all books issued between 1837 and 1852, was published in 1853; it was continued as the <span class="italic">English Catalogue</span>, with four further volumes appearing between 1864 and 1882. Subject indexes were issued in 1858 and in 1876, the first being reprinted in 1976 and the second in 1979, as important sources for literary historians. Low was also manager of a society for the protection of retail booksellers against undersellers until the dissolution of the society in 1852. In 1841 Low compiled and published <span class="italic">Low's Comparative Register of the House of Commons, 1827&#150;1841</span>, six years later producing an updated version covering the years 1841 to 1847. About 1844 he met Fletcher Harper of New York, and became his literary agent and correspondent, and one of the chief American booksellers in London. In 1848, in conjunction with his eldest son, Low opened a publishing office at the corner of Red Lion Court, Fleet Street. In 1852 they moved to 47 (and later to 14) Ludgate Hill, where, with the aid of David Bogue, an American department was opened. In 1856 Edward Marston became a partner, and Bogue retired. The firm moved in 1867 to 188 Fleet Street, and, two years after publishing <span class="italic">Low's Literary Almanack and Illustrated Souvenir for 1873</span>, Low retired in 1875. In 1887 the firm moved again, to St Dunstan's House, Fetter Lane, and subsequently to Paternoster Row.<br>
<br>In addition to his business commitments, Low found time for many philanthropic projects. With his son he was mainly instrumental in establishing in 1843 the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, and supervised it until 1867, when it was taken over by the Metropolitan Board of Works. From its foundation in 1837 he took the deepest interest in the Booksellers' Provident Institution, serving on the committee and acting as a vice-president, and bequeathing it a handsome legacy in his will.<br>
<br>The death of Low's eldest son on 5 March 1871 was a great blow. Sampson Low jun. had been an invalid, but had taken a considerable share in the business, compiling <span class="italic">The Charities of London</span> in 1850, a popular and useful reference work which formed the basis for four further editions between 1854 and 1870. Low's wife died on 26 May 1881, in her eighty-fourth year, within a month of their anticipated diamond wedding anniversary, and a few months later, on 25 September 1881, Low lost his second son. Low himself died at home on 16 April 1886, at 41 Mecklenburgh Square, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was survived by his daughter, Mary Ann.<br>
