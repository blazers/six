<span class="headword">Blair,  Alexander</span>  (1789&#150;1859), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 18 June 1789, the son of William Blair, a captain in the 13th regiment of foot, and his wife, Margaret Freeland. Nothing seems to be known of his early life, but his commercial education began in a merchant's house in Liverpool. In 1811 he entered the service of the British Linen Bank in Edinburgh. He began as a confidential clerk and, from there, proceeded to the position of assistant secretary. In 1826 he was appointed joint secretary. Two years later the manager and secretary of the bank both resigned, and Blair was appointed joint manager with Thomas Corrie, a director of the bank, who resigned from the board upon his appointment as joint manager. Blair was to be paid &pound;800 plus &pound;100 for a house, while Corrie was paid &pound;1400. On 7 May 1828 Blair married Mary Smith (1800&#150;1872), the daughter of George Smith, a banker. They had one daughter, Mary Elizabeth (1830&#150;1857).<br>
<br>If Blair resented his situation at the British Linen Bank he did not have to endure it for long, for in July 1832 the treasurer of Scotland's oldest bank, the Bank of Scotland, resigned after pressure from his board, and Blair was appointed to the position at a salary of &pound;1200. What the Bank of Scotland needed was a reforming manager who had strong views on financial management and business organization. They found both of these attributes in Blair. He began by reforming the reporting practices in the bank to ensure that he and the board were continuously aware of the position of the bank, and &#145;he quickly made his mark as an effective banker, at once energetic and disciplined, with an ability for work on accounts, the auditing and control of branches and the huge volume of administrative work required of a Bank Treasurer&#146;  (Saville, 301).<br>
<br>This was a difficult time for banks as many new joint-stock banks were being set up, thereby increasing the competitive pressures. The Bank of Scotland's profits continued to be under pressure, and Blair wrote a very incisive treasurer's report for his board. This was a comprehensive review, which considered the bank's internal affairs as well as such topics as joint-stock banking, the role of the Bank of England, and &#145;the probable intention of the Government upon the subject of the currency&#146;  (Checkland, 354). Blair realized that, despite the boom in business, the Bank of Scotland's profits were actually falling. The only real solutions to this problem were a lowering of the deposit rate and the introduction of charges on services (as English banks did), but the Bank of Scotland was unable to act unilaterally. Blair therefore worked for the introduction of a code of conduct for all Scottish banks.<br>
<br>Blair had very sound ideas about how a bank should view its balance sheet, especially its reserve ratios and its dividend policy. It is easy, in reading his letters, to see Blair as the arch conservative banker, and there was much about his demeanour which would confirm this view. But the bank emerged from his period as treasurer as a healthier and larger institution with a reputation for sound judgement and good faith. Under Blair's firm hand a more limited role was allowed to directors and Scottish politicians on the board, and his managerial reforms led to a greater degree of professionalism.<br>
<br>By the later 1840s Blair had become convinced that the Scottish banking system was dangerously weak. His preferred solution was a merger of the three public banks in Edinburgh. Once consolidated, an institution comprising the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the British Linen Bank would perform in Scotland a role analogous to that of the Bank of England. However, although Blair obtained promises of government support, he was unable to secure approval from his colleagues in the other two banks.<br>
<br>Blair certainly did not believe in untrammelled competition, viewing it as potentially damaging to both the profitability and the stability of the financial system. In the early 1840s he made several efforts to get the Scottish banks to agree to uniform rates of interest for deposits and discounts. However, it usually proved difficult to hold the parties together for very long. Blair conceded that agreements would end when it suited the needs of any individual bank. &#145;Experience shows&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that the banks have never acted together unless compelled to do so by the state of the money market, and that all proceedings of committees have been disavowed by one or other of the Boards&#146;  (Checkland, 391). Nevertheless, the regular meetings which he established between senior bankers became the committee of Scottish bank general managers, the basis for the cartel which operated for more than a century.<br>
<br>Blair skilfully defended Scottish banking principles and methods before a number of parliamentary committees, and he became embroiled in the currency and banking debate. He was a friend of Thomas Tooke, who wrote part of his <span class="italic">History of Prices</span> (6 vols., 1838&#150;57) in Blair's house at Drylaw. Volume 3 is dedicated to Blair. The passage of the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Acts</span> of 1844 and 1845 led to widespread condemnation in Scotland. Blair and other Scottish bankers objected to the degree of banking centralization and control that the acts introduced. Not only did the legislation impose a costly requirement to hold reserve gold, but, by inhibiting the formation of new banks, it supported the cartel over prices operated via the general managers' committee. Although Blair believed that the legislation of 1844 and 1845 was intellectually flawed, he nevertheless conceded that in practice it contained some useful operating principles.<br>
<br>Blair saw himself, or rather his bank, as the policeman of the system, and in the 1830s he led the other public banks in an attempt to discipline what he believed to be the financially irresponsible Western Bank of Scotland. Blair's view of the Western as a potential problem was well founded, for it was the Western's failure in 1857 which did so much damage to the reputation of the Scottish banking system. It was again Blair who led the effort to minimize the damage of the crisis. However, it and the report, and evidence from the select committee on the <span class="roman">Bank Acts</span>, &#145;thoroughly depressed&#146;  (Saville, 406) Blair, who was disappointed that the support given by the Bank of Scotland to bolstering the Scottish banking system had not been appreciated. Unfortunately, Blair experienced a personal blow when, in the middle of the crisis, his only child, Mary, died in childbirth. Blair enjoyed indifferent health throughout 1858, and died on 1 February 1859 at his home, Beechwood, Edinburgh, as a result of influenza. He was buried in St John's churchyard, Princes Street, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Blair took a professional interest in economic debate, but he was also a classical scholar who read the psalms in Hebrew. For recreation he played sacred music on an organ, and otherwise conducted himself in a modest manner. He had a wide circle of correspondents, who included the leading banking theoreticians such as J. R. McCulloch, Lord Overstone, and the MP John Abel Smith.<br>
<br>One of the most highly regarded Scottish bankers of his time, Blair strove to defend the interests of the Bank of Scotland, while also working to transform the nature of the Scottish financial system. Yet while he undoubtedly succeeded in the former role, Blair did not generate enough support for his schemes of bank merger. In the period before the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Acts</span> of 1844 and 1845 his arguments did not prove powerful enough to undermine the influence of the Bank of England. &#145;This failure to maintain the pre-eminence of Scottish banking ideas&#146;, Richard Saville has recently concluded, &#145;rather clouded his judgement in later years and induced a reluctance to take part in national debate, although in purely banking terms he was able to deal with the periodic crises of the banking system&#146;  (Saville, 301).<br>
