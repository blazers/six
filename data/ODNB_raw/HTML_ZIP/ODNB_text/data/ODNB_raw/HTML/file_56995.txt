<span class="headword">Hack,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1671&#150;1702), <span class="occ">chart maker</span>, was the son of Charles Hack, a Winchester innkeeper. He was apprenticed to Andrew Welch, a cartographer of the Thames, or Drapers' Company, school of chart makers in London for a term of nine years on 25 January 1671. There is no record that Hack was ever made free of the Drapers' Company. The school specialized in the composition of highly stylized manuscript portolan charts. Towards the end of his apprenticeship Hack introduced several innovations in charts prepared for Welch, the most striking of which was the replacement of rhumb lines &#145;by the rectangular grid of the projectionless plane chart with the quarter compass rose which is perhaps Hack's most individual feature&#146;  (Campbell, 94). After leaving Welch, Hack concentrated mainly on the production of paper charts, bound into atlases, offering sequential coverage of large areas of coastline.<br>
<br>In 1682, under conditions of the utmost secrecy, Hack was commissioned by government ministers to copy the book of charts seized by Captain Bartholomew Sharpe off Cape Pasado (modern Ecuador) in June 1681. Hack capitalized on this opportunity by producing an unnecessarily lavish presentation copy for Charles II in what appears to have been a deft suit for royal patronage  (BL, Maps K. Mar. VIII.15). Hack also obtained the journals of Sharpe and Basil Ringrose, which were copied and edited under his direction over the course of the next twenty years (copies of these two works are at BL, Sloane MS 46B and 48 respectively). The finished products were among items he presented to his royal patrons, Charles II and James II, and to a select coterie of other sponsors, notably Christopher Monk, second duke of Albemarle, and John, Lord Somers, chancellor of England. Hack is not known to have kept an apprentice, but he was assisted in producing copies of Sharpe's journal by the Jewish linguist Phillip Dassigny.<br>
<br>Hack's prolific output of manuscript charts outstripped that of any other member of the Thames school. A conservative estimate of the total number of charts he personally produced between 1682 and 1702 exceeds 300, although this probably represents a fraction of the true figure. Many of these were multiple copies of the charts deriving from Sharpe's voyage, but he also produced atlases of coastlines in Africa and the Orient. His business premises were &#145;At the Signe of Great Britain and Ireland&#146; by Wapping New Stairs, London, although from the evidence of several charts dated 1686 he seems to have had a temporary address at Gun Wharf. Towards the end of his career Hack prospered and his interests diversified. In December 1695 he was apparently resident in Mile End Green, having adopted the rank of captain in correspondence with Sir William Trumbull over a scheme to press foreigners into the naval service. In 1699, as &#145;Capt. William Hacke&#146;, he edited and published <span class="italic">A Collection of Original Voyages</span> printed by James Knapton, printer to the Royal Society. The collection contained an abridged account of Sharpe's voyage and illustrations by Herman Moll.<br>
<br>Hack's activities formed part of the thriving industry which surrounded England's general maritime expansion in the late seventeenth century. Although he was primarily a copyist, his shrewd manipulation of patronage enabled him to remain buoyant throughout the period when manuscript charts were displaced by printed ones, and the influence of his work may even have extended beyond his lifetime. Upon the formation of the South Sea Company in 1711, the directors obtained a copy of Hack's <span class="roman">South Sea Waggoner</span> (a book of sea charts known as a waggoner after the first printed atlas of charts by Lucas Sanszoon Waghenaer), containing 131 charts  (Hunt. L., HM 265). These charts may have informed the audacious plans for a south sea trade which the directors laid before Robert Harley.<br>
<br>Hack's last map is dated 1702. Nothing is known of his subsequent life or his death. It is not known whether he married or had children.<br>
