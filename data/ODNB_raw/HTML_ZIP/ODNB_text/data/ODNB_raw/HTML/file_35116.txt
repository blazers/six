<span class="headword">Morris,  Philip Richard</span>  (1836&#150;1902), <span class="occ">genre and marine painter</span>, was born in Devonport, Devon, on 4 December 1836, the son of John Simmons Morris, an iron-founder, and his wife, Anne Saunders. His father took him to London in 1850 to train for the family business, but, fascinated by plates he saw in periodicals, Morris became more and more interested in art. With the encouragement of Holman Hunt, who intervened on his behalf with his father, he began to study art, first drawing in the evenings at the British Museum, and then, in 1855, in the Royal Academy Schools. He did well there, winning silver medals for drawing, painting, and portraiture. In 1858 he was awarded the gold medal and a travelling studentship for <span class="italic">The Good Samaritan</span>; he used this to visit Italy and France, where he stayed until 1864. It was also in 1858 that he submitted two paintings to the Royal Academy exhibition, and, with only a few breaks, he exhibited there until 1901; he also exhibited regularly at the Society of British Artists and, between 1877 and 1888, at the Grosvenor Gallery.<br>
<br>Of Morris's early paintings the best known are his seashore subjects, for example, <span class="italic">Voices from the Sea</span> (1860), based on verses by Tennyson, <span class="italic">Drift Wreck from the Armada</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">The Sailor's Wedding</span> (1876). He painted several allegorical scenes of country life, such as <span class="italic">The Mowers</span> (1875), <span class="italic">The Reaper and the Flowers</span> (exh. Grosvenor Gallery 1877), <span class="italic">Death and the Woodman</span> (1879), and <span class="italic">Garland Day, Dorsetshire Coast</span> (1893). Under the influence of Hunt, Morris painted a number of religious subjects, most notably <span class="italic">Golgotha, or, Where they Crucified him</span> (1862; Sunderland Museum) and <span class="italic">The Summit of Calvary</span> (1871), engraved by Paul Jonnard. But the most popular of his works was <span class="italic">Sons of the Brave</span> (1880), which showed the orphaned boys of soldiers of the Chelsea Hospital, emerging into the street as a musical band, a painting noted by a contemporary critic as full of character and ability. His later career was dominated by portraiture, and his sitters included Daniel Adamson, the chairman of the Manchester ship canal (1884), Colonel Edis (1889), and Sir Robert Rawlinson KCB (1892).<br>
<br>Morris was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1877, but gradually his powers as an artist were seen even by sympathetic contemporaries to be on the wane, and he began to suffer from ill health. In 1900 he resigned his associateship. He died on 22 April 1902 at his home, 92 Clifton Hill, Maida Vale, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He was married to a widow, Mrs Sargeantson, the daughter of J. Evans of Llangollen, and had two sons and three daughters. Paintings by Morris are in the collections of Blackburn Art Gallery, Leeds City Art Gallery, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Manchester City Galleries, and Sunderland Museum.<br>
