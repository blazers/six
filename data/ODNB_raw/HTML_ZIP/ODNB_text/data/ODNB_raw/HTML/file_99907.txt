<span class="headword">Hall,  Clifford Samuel <span class="st"> [Cliff]</span></span>  (1925&#150;2008), <span class="occ">singer and guitarist</span>, was born of Jamaican parents in Oriente Province, Cuba, on 11 September 1925. His father, Arthur Bertram Hall, was a plantation worker. As a child he studied at both Spanish and English schools, but following the death of his mother, and his father's subsequent remarriage (together with the outbreak of the Second World War), he relocated with his father to Jamaica. Arthur Hall could not afford further education for his son, so Cliff, at the age of fourteen, became an agricultural worker.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the RAF recruited many West Indian servicemen and, after lying about his age, Hall joined the RAF and came to Britain for basic training as a mechanic in November 1942. He was based in Hartlebury in Worcestershire for most of the war, but his job involved travelling across Britain delivering and installing aircraft parts. Prior to demobilization he studied for an electrical engineering qualification in Leeds. There he met a Scottish factory worker, Janet Greer Massie (1922&#150;1985), and they were married on 10 November 1947 at Leeds register office. They had a daughter, Lynn (1949&#150;2007), and two sons, Clifford junior (<i>b</i>. 1951) and Robert (<i>b</i>. 1962).<br>
<br>Hall later recalled that he<blockquote>always enjoyed listening to the sound of guitar music; I liked to listen to country and western music on the American Forces Network radio station, so I bought a cheap guitar in Leeds and learned to strum along to the radio and the odd record Janet and I had, just to amuse myself. (personal knowledge)</blockquote>In 1953 he was working as an electrician in Leeds when he was subcontracted to the atomic site at Capenhurst, outside Chester. There he met Tony Davis, who invited him to hear his jazz group in Liverpool; Hall was soon playing along on bongos. These jazz jam sessions led to the formation in September 1958 of the Spinners folk group: Cliff Hall, Tony Davis, Mick Groves, Hughie Jones, and Jacqui McDonald were the original members. Jones was the only Liverpudlian in the group, but the group was often referred to as &#145;the Liverpool Spinners&#146;, in part to distinguish them from the American Motown group of the same name. From their beginnings in the basement of Samson and Barlow's restaurant in London Road, Liverpool, the Spinners came to specialize in folk, maritime, and &#145;folk revival&#146; material, although Hall, like Tony Davis, always had a penchant for a wider variety of music genres, and he added many Caribbean songs to the Spinners' repertoire. They were, therefore, an eclectic combination, which did not always go down well in certain &#145;purist&#146; folk circles. However, by the late 1950s and early 1960s their cheerful and entertaining performances had built the group a steady following in Liverpool, and they opened one of Liverpool's first folk clubs, which soon found a home at Gregson's Well public house in Low Hill. Hall was by this time an accomplished guitarist, and also added occasional harmonica to the Spinners' sound.<br>
<br>When Jacqui McDonald left the Spinners in 1962 she was not replaced, and the musical balance within the group changed. In contrast to the more raucous sea songs sung by the whole group McDonald had sung the quieter songs, so Hall, with his gentle baritone, took on the key role of providing contrast and grain. His quiet, textured voice gave the Spinners a different, more commercial, sound with &#145;a unique and captivating flavour&#146;  (Stuckey, foreword). However, while his voice changed the Spinners' sound, his very membership raised their profile, for the group was undoubtedly the first multiracial singing group to enjoy major success in the UK. While by the 1960s the folk revival was regarded by its protagonists as creating a kind of musical space for everyman, it largely consisted of white music played in white environments. Indeed, it was very unusual in the early 1960s for a folk group to include a black member. This fact brought some racist comments during the Spinners' early days, for jibes concerning their so-called &#145;lack of authenticity&#146; were usually directed at the Caribbean material. (Similarly, black Liverpudlian attitudes to the group could also be mixed, some regarding Hall as a rather less than authentic representation of Liverpool's black community.) Racism also reared its head by the time the group had commenced recording in 1962: when the Spinners came to release their first album, <span class="italic">Quayside Songs Old and New</span>, that year, EMI (who owned the HMV label) was uncomfortable about promoting a multiracial group. Instead of a photograph of the group, a cartoon adorned the LP cover, and all the members appeared to be white. However, the group's second album, <span class="italic">The Spinners</span> (1963), issued by Fontana, sported a photograph of the four musicians round a spinning wheel.<br>
<br>Regular weekends in London spent consulting the archives in the English Folk Dance and Song Society's Vaughan Williams Library together with singing at The Troubadour and other folk clubs in the capital expanded the Spinners' repertoire and live reputation. But invitations to sing at folk events around the country placed strain on their day jobs. The Spinners turned fully professional in 1963. Encouraged by Michael Flanders and Donald Swann, they hired St George's Hall in Liverpool and quickly sold out a concert. The following year they booked the city's Philharmonic Hall: recordings of the concert were released on two subsequent LPs, <span class="italic">Folk at the Phil!</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">More Folk at the Phil!</span> (1965). Turning professional meant that they looked to concert halls rather than folk clubs for their gigs. This further alienated the purists, but also meant that they achieved a reputation far beyond the rather closeted folk circles, especially after they embraced the ever expanding medium of television. They had already appeared in episodes of the Associated-Rediffusion series <span class="italic">Looking About</span> in 1961 and ABC's <span class="italic">Hullabaloo!</span> in 1963. Several further guest appearances were followed by seven series of <span class="italic">The Spinners</span> for the BBC, broadcast between 1970 and 1981, and by regular Christmas broadcasts until 1985. They also sang the theme to the film <span class="italic">Funeral in Berlin</span> (1967), starring Michael Caine. Meanwhile, they continued to produce new LPs on a regular basis, one of them entitled <span class="italic">Not Quite Folk</span> (1969).<br>
<br>In 1965 fellow Fontana artists Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders &#145;borrowed&#146; Cliff Hall to add his deep voice to the word &#145;love&#146; in the recording of &#145;Game of Love&#146;, which reached number one in the American singles chart and number two in the UK. This was the nearest any Spinner came to singles success of their own. Like many of their folk-based contemporaries, the Spinners did not to any great extent flirt with singles releases; however, the group became synonymous with contemporary songs such as &#145;Dirty Old Town&#146; (by Ewan MacColl), &#145;In My Liverpool Home&#146; (by Pete McGovern), &#145;Black and White&#146; (by Earl Robinson), and &#145;The Family of Man&#146; (by Karl Dallas). &#145;Black and White&#146; was thought to be a nod towards Hall's race. The Liverpool historian Ray Costello later commented:<blockquote>Some felt that this song was overly sentimental, as it played upon black and white children sharing a blissfully idyllic school-life, but such was the appeal of this well-loved group and their genial style, that they managed to carry it off with some success. (Costello, 76)</blockquote>Indeed, Hall's very presence in a &#145;white folk group&#146; helped to shape the discourse surrounding not only the Liverpool black community (of which he was not ostensibly a member), but also music, race, representation through genre, and black realization.<br>
<br>Like his fellow Spinners, Hall was awarded the gold badge of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. The group supported many charities and humanitarian causes, and raised money for Mother Teresa through War on Want, as well as for Queen's Park School, Lincoln, a school for young people with learning difficulties where Hall was on the board of governors. The group disbanded in 1988, although there were several reunions, including when the group led the community singing at the all-Merseyside FA cup final in 1989. Following a knee operation Hall convalesced in Australia, where he met a Spinners' fan, Dorothy, who was a nurse from Birkenhead. By this time he had been widowed twice; he stayed in Australia and they were soon married. He died in Adelaide on 26 June 2008 and was survived by Dorothy, as well as by the two sons of his first marriage.<br>
