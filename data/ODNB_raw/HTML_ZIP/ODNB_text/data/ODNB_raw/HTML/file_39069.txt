<span class="headword">Marshall,  Peter</span>  (1902&#150;1949), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church of the United States</span>, was born on 27 May 1902 at 70 Henderson Street, in industrial Coatbridge, the son of Peter Marshall, insurance agent, and his wife, Janet Muir. He was four years old when his father died. Domestic discord followed his mother's remarriage, and Marshall sought enlistment in the Royal Navy, but at fourteen was rejected as under age. He found employment with an engineering firm and studied at evening classes. During his next nine years in the iron and steel industry he became active in churches and was drawn to the Christian ministry, thanks to the influence of missionaries such as Eric Liddell, the Scottish Olympic champion. Hopes of being sent to China by the London Missionary Society failed to materialize as he lacked academic qualifications.<br>
<br>A visiting cousin drew his interest to America, and in 1927 Marshall became an immigrant, arriving alone in New York with no prospects. He dug ditches across New Jersey and took other jobs until a former classmate invited him to Alabama, where he was promised work on a Birmingham newspaper. Marshall travelled south, worked as a galley proof-reader and became active at the city's First Presbyterian church. The pastor, Dr Trevor Mordecai, befriended the young Scot, and he soon became a scoutmaster, ministerial candidate, and teacher of the men's <span class="roman">Bible</span> class. He was accepted at Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, Georgia, where his schooling in Scotland was accepted as equivalent to the American degree of bachelor of arts. For two years his seminary expenses were paid by the Birmingham <span class="roman">Bible</span> class. Graduating <i>magna cum laude</i> in 1931, he spent two years as pastor of the Covington Presbyterian Church, Georgia, before accepting a call to the Westminster Presbyterian Church, Atlanta.<br>
<br>Marshall's renown as a dynamic preacher and orator of irreproachable character began spreading through the south. One popular sermon he titled &#145;Azaleas and agnostics&#146;. On 4 November 1936 he married a member of his church, Catherine Wood, a 22-year-old student at Agnes Scott College. Negotiations had already begun by New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, Washington, DC, enquiring whether the tall, impressive Marshall would consider becoming senior pastor of &#145;the church of Abraham Lincoln&#146;. In 1937 he accepted and began a magnificent ministry of faith and prayer in the nation's capital, attracting large weekly crowds. A year later he became a naturalized US citizen, and received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from the Presbyterian college, Clinton, South Carolina.<br>
<br>In March 1946, while delivering a sermon, Marshall suffered a heart attack. Upon recovering, he resumed the strenuous pace of his ministry, and in January 1947 was elected by the United States senate to be its chaplain. He quickly established a reputation in the senate chambers for the sharp and pungent quality of his prayers. During a debate on foreign aid in 1947, he opened one session with &#145;O God our Father, give us the determination to make the right things happen, and the courage to stand for something, lest we fall for anything. Amen&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Prayers</span>). Senators of both parties began arriving early to hear the prayers offered by their chaplain. Despite the dangerous condition of his heart Marshall continued to accelerate the pace of his ministry, as outside invitations to preach increased. On 25 January 1949 he awoke very early with pains in his chest and arms. He was taken to the George Washington Hospital, Washington, DC, but he died from a severe heart attack. On Thursday 27 January 1949 Dr Clarence W. Cranford, Baptist minister, offered before the senate the last prayer prepared by Peter Marshall: &#145;Deliver us, our Father, from futile hopes and from clinging to lost causes &hellip; We know that we cannot do everything, but help us to do something. For Jesus' sake, Amen&#146;  (ibid.). His wife, Catherine, wrote a best-selling biography of him, entitled <span class="italic">A Man called Peter</span> (1951); and she also edited a volume of his sermons and prayers, <span class="italic">Mr Jones, Meet the Master</span> (1951). His life story became the subject of an acclaimed film.<br>
