<span class="headword">Charles,  Ethel Mary</span>  (1871&#150;1962), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 25 March 1871 in India, the second of six children of Thomas Edmondston Charles (1834&#150;1906), a doctor in private practice (formerly of the Indian army) and an early advocate of cremation, and his wife, Ada Henrietta (1848&#150;1931/2), daughter of Francis and Fanny Ada Rundall. Her father was lowland Scottish and her mother was English. Her elder sister, <a name="cosubject_63719"></a><span class="headword">Bessie Ada Charles</span>  (1869&#150;1932), also an <span class="occ">architect</span> and her closest ally, was born in India two years previously. The family returned from India in 1877 and settled in Cannes long enough for the girls to learn French with a Midi accent (1878&#150;80). From 1880 to 1900 the Charles family spent summers in Switzerland and winters in Rome, paying an annual visit to England. Ethel and Bessie Charles were educated privately and both were presented at court. They read modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford (1891&#150;2), achieving degree standard, but went down after a year.<br>
<br>Encouraged by their father to pursue a profession, and doubtless stimulated by travel, Ethel and Bessie Charles selected architecture, a highly unusual vocation for Victorian women. Their decision was taken at the height of campaigns by the women's movement to open the professions to women. They were articled for three years (1892&#150;5) to the architects Ernest George and Peto, London. George considered them serious and dedicated students, but outside the office the path was not smooth: the part-time evening courses which male apprentices took as a matter of course to supplement their training were either closed or only marginally opened to them. In 1892 they were proposed for membership of the Architectural Association, but withdrew after opposition. They attended the school of architecture at University College, London, studying architecture as a fine art, a course in architectural history (second class certificates, 1892&#150;3); however, they did not take the professional elements of the programme, which were not thought appropriate for women students.<br>
<br>Ethel Charles continued to expand her architectural knowledge at the margins of professional training. She took distinctions in university extension courses in English and classical architecture (1892&#150;3) and began sketching English architecture, a practice which she extended to France and Italy and continued throughout her career. A life-long reader of the <span class="italic">Wykehamist</span>, her brother's school magazine, she entered two <span class="italic">Building News</span> Designing Club competitions under the name of Wykehamica, coming second with a design for a block of three labourers' cottages in 1895. She acquired additional professional experience in the office of an arts and crafts architect, Walter W. Crane, in 1896.<br>
<br>For sixty-four years, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the central professional body for architecture, neither had nor contemplated the possibility of women members, although a few women practised professionally outside its auspices. In June 1898 Ethel Charles became the first woman to sit for the associates' examination at the RIBA. After concerted opposition, she was elected to associate membership in 1898, but a few months later the RIBA came within one vote of passing a motion designed to exclude women. One year later, in 1900, Bessie Charles took the qualifying examination and was elected. Ethel Charles found herself embroiled in debates about appropriate spheres for women and became a focus of attention in the building press in Britain and America. She was the first woman to address an architectural society in Britain, speaking to the Architectural Association, London, in February 1902. Her subject and title&#151;not of her own choosing&#151;was &#145;A plea for women practising architecture&#146;. She argued boldly, but the sharp debate afterwards and press criticism prompted her to select strictly architectural topics in her addresses to allied societies of the RIBA in Liverpool in 1903 and Leeds in 1905. She won the RIBA essay medal in 1905 for &#145;The development of architectural art from structural requirements and nature of materials&#146;.<br>
<br>From 1898 to 1905 Ethel and Bessie Charles lived together at 46 York Street Chambers, Marylebone, London, which provided accommodation for single professional women. Ethel Charles was handsome and contemptuous of fashion, while Bessie Charles was small, principled, and bossy in a quiet way. Their emotional life centred around their brothers and their children, on whom they lavished attention and treats but in an educational spirit. They worked from home but not always together, with Ethel proving the more active of the two. In their small, predominantly domestic practice, they used vernacular materials according to arts and crafts principles: Ethel Charles designed a house for a doctor (1901) and three labourers' cottages for Letchworth Garden City (1905), and collaborated with her sister on alterations to a house for a female client (1902). Both sisters lived from time to time in the family home in Camberley, Surrey, but they shifted the focus of their architectural practice to Cornwall when their parents bought Clift Cottage, Flushing. Ethel Charles designed two semi-detached houses (1906 and 1907) and with her sister made alterations and additions to two other houses (1905); their most notable work was the design of the Bible Christian Chapel, Falmouth harbour (1906).<br>
<br>Ethel Charles's one moment of international architectural success came in 1909 when she won a competition for a church in Germany, beating 200 male architects in Berlin. However, virtually no architectural drawings survive after 1911. After the First World War she kept house for her brother, the commandant of the Royal Military Academy (whose library lobby she proposed panelling in 1925), and delighted in her cats and reading Kipling. She died on 8 April 1962 in Hollow Oak Nursing Home in Haverthwaite, Lancashire. She was cremated in Blackpool and her ashes were placed in Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex, alongside her sister who had died much earlier, on 4 November 1932, at 18 Heatherdale Road, Camberley, Surrey. Ethel Charles left her architectural drawings and sketchbooks to the RIBA.<br>
