<span class="headword">Ocland,  Christopher</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1590), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was a native of Buckinghamshire, though his parentage is unknown. When St Saviour's Grammar School in Southwark obtained its charter in 1562, Ocland became its first headmaster, and held the position for seven years. In 1571, when St Olave's Grammar School, located near by in the same borough, was founded, he was the first man to present himself for election to become its master, arriving with letters from Robert Horne, the bishop of Winchester, and William Fleetwood, the recorder of London. He was offered the post but, informed that there would be a fortnight's delay before he could enter on it, he refused &#145;and went on his way being angrie, and set the matter lighte&#146; (Carrington, 27&#150;9, 46; Ellis, 65). About 1574 Ocland became the first headmaster of Richard Pate's grammar school at Cheltenham; it is not known precisely when or why he left the post  (Bell, 25).<br>
<br>Ocland's principal work, <span class="italic">Anglorum proelia</span> (&#145;The Battles of the English&#146;), a lengthy poem of almost 3500 Latin hexameters dealing with English military history from Edward III to Mary Tudor, was published at his own expense in 1580. Such a broad sweep of time means that detail is often lacking, but Ocland's clear Latin and lucid narrative style suggest that the book was written with a pedagogical intention. Apart from set speeches there is a minimum of literary embellishment, and the tone of Ocland's poem has been criticized as too little varied. He writes with enthusiasm, though, and with reverence for victorious monarchs: at Cr&eacute;cy, Edward III and his son the Black Prince embody English prowess in battle:<blockquote>
<div>Fulminat ense pater Princeps Edvardus, &amp; eius<br>
</div>
<div>Filius impubes; illoque Britannica virtus<br>
</div>
<div>Quanta sit eluxit bello, quo millia caesa<br>
</div>
<div>Triginta aut plus eo, campique cruore madebant.<br>
</div>(King Edward blazes with his sword, as does his youthful son; British valour shone out to its full extent in that battle, in which thirty thousand or more were killed, and the fields were sodden with gore. Sig. F2<i>r</i>)</blockquote>
<span class="italic"><i>Eir&#275;narchia</i>, sive, Elizabetha</span> (1582) brought Ocland's versification of history up to date. The verse is in much the same vein as before, but the volume has interest as a historical poem dealing with recent events and for its treatment of contemporary figures&#151;it contains a brief, laudatory catalogue of the leading men of the day. This poem also contains more literary touches, in particular Anne Boleyn's dream prophesying the future of the Tudor dynasty and the triumph of protestantism  (sig. B4<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The quality of Ocland's verse and his patriotic treatment of England's martial glory received commendation at court  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, 13.389). When <span class="italic">Anglorum proelia</span> was reissued in 1582 with <span class="italic"><i>Eir&#275;narchia</i></span> (and, in some editions, Alexander Neville's Latin poem on Kett's rebellion), it was prefixed by letters, signed by members of the privy council and the ecclesiastical high commission, commanding that the book should be taught in every grammar and free school within the kingdom. While it is unclear how far this injunction was carried out (see Baldwin, 1.112; Clarke, 11), the book's influence can be traced in literary and historical works in Latin and the vernacular. The second edition of Raphael Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> (1587), for example, draws freely from it, and Joshua Barnes, composing his Anglo-Latin epic on Edward III, the <span class="italic">Franciad</span>, a century later, cites Ocland on several occasions. <span class="italic">Anglorum proelia</span> is also alluded to in the satires of Bishop Joseph Hall  (bk 4, satire 3), and was acclaimed by William Webbe  (Webbe, 30). <span class="italic"><i>Eir&#275;narchia</i></span> and <span class="italic">Anglorum proelia</span> were popular enough at the time they were published to be rendered into English: <span class="italic">The Valiant Actes and Victorious Battails of the English Nation</span> and <span class="italic">Elizabeth Queene</span> were both translated by John Sharrock and emerged in 1585. In addition, <span class="italic"><i>Eir&#275;narchia</i></span> was still sufficiently well known in 1680 for its relation of Anne Boleyn's vision&#151;selected for its anti-Catholic sentiment&#151;to be translated anonymously as <span class="italic">The Pope's Farewell, or, Queen Ann's Dream</span>.<br>
<br>Ocland's narration of Elizabeth's reign in Latin verse continues in the final instalment of his series of historical poems, <span class="italic">Elizabetheis</span> (1589), much of which is devoted to the events of the Armada year. His only other published work was <span class="italic">The Fountaine and Welspring of All Variance, Sedition, and Deadlie Hate</span> (1589). This is a turgid tract of exegesis in English prose, which demonstrates that the descriptions of Babylon in the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> signify Rome, and that sundry other passages from the same source indicate that the day of judgement is nigh. It has been conjectured that Ocland contributed to <span class="italic">Certaine Notes Set Forth in Foure and Three Parts to be Song</span>, printed by John Day in 1560 (reprinted 1565), but this was in fact the composer Robert Okeland (<i>fl</i>. 1532&#150;1555)  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>, 1980, 13.523).<br>
<br>Poverty blighted Ocland's later career. In September 1589 he was penniless, residing at the sign of the George in Whitechapel, Middlesex, and on 13 October 1590 he wrote to Lord Burghley, begging for relief in his distress  (Ellis, 70&#150;74). He humbly desired that her majesty might give him a prebend or benefice&#151;suggesting that he was in holy orders&#151;and claimed that his literary labours had gone unrewarded. In the same letter he mentioned that a certain serjeant of London had a <i>capias utlagatum</i> out for him over a debt that he owed. Anne, his wife, had been paralysed for upwards of three years, he wrote, and her malady worsened daily on account of the indigence of her children. He concluded: &#145;I teach schole at Grenewych, where my labor wyll not fynde me bread and drynck&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). The letter also alludes to a new work in four books that Ocland had been working on, concerning the baseness of Catholicism and the persecution of protestants; it was never published.<br>
<br>Christopher Ocland's is a sizeable <i>&#339;uvre</i> that should not be overlooked. He was one of a number of schoolmaster Latin authors of the sixteenth century, but his importance stems from the high regard in which his historical verse was held, and for its long-lasting influence.<br>
