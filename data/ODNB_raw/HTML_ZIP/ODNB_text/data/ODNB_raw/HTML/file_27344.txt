<span class="headword">Thorne,  James</span>  (1815&#150;1881), <span class="occ">topographical writer and antiquary</span>, was born in London in September 1815. He was probably the James Thorne baptized on 8 October at St Mary's, Whitechapel, the son of James and Rebecca Thorne. He was educated at a private school, and for several years afterwards worked as an artist. As a young man he supplied short articles on antiquarian subjects to <span class="italic">The Mirror</span>, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and other publications, the result of research in libraries and of frequent rambles through many districts of England. In 1843 he became connected with the author and publisher Charles Knight, and they collaborated for more than twenty-five years. The reissue, in 1873, of Knight's <span class="italic">Passages of a Working Life</span> contained an introductory note by Thorne.<br>
<br>Under Knight's direction Thorne contributed many topographical articles to the second series of the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>, and wrote large portions, besides supplying many illustrations, of the four volumes, entitled <span class="italic">The Land we Live in</span> (1847&#150;50). His <span class="italic">Rambles by Rivers</span>, published under Knight's aegis between 1844 and 1849, covered mainly rivers in the south of England; a contemporary critic found them &#145;delightful volumes&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>). Thorne was also working editor of the two volumes on geography in <span class="italic">The Imperial Cyclopaedia</span> (2 vols., 1830&#150;53) and of the <span class="italic">English Cyclopaedia</span> (1854&#150;70) with its supplements, and for twenty-five years he wrote for the <span class="italic">Companion to the British Almanac</span>. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 21 March 1872.<br>
<br>Thorne's energies were for several years devoted to the compilation of the two volumes of his <span class="italic">Handbook to the Environs of London</span> (1876), a painstakingly detailed survey of the topography, buildings, and historic remains for 20 miles around London. His great knowledge and immense industry are shown throughout its pages, and it remains his lasting achievement; an overview of London histories published in 1968 called it &#145;a useful and well documented reference book&#146;  (Rubinstein, 138), and its enduring value has been further attested by its reissue in facsimile (1970 and 1983). At the time of his death he was engaged in preparing a new edition of Peter Cunningham's <span class="italic">Handbook of London</span>, which he thoroughly revised, adding &#145;much fresh information and many illustrative quotations&#146;  (preface, v). The revision was completed by Henry B. Wheatley, who published it as <span class="italic">London Past and Present</span> in 1891 and paid generous tribute to Thorne in his preface. Thorne died of cancer of the colon at his home, 52 Fortess Road, Kentish Town, London, on 3 September 1881, leaving his widow and their children in straitened circumstances. An obituarist noted that he &#145;was not a prolific writer, but he did his work most carefully and conscientiously, and in a manner which commanded the respect of those in whose service his pen was employed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Sept 1881).<br>
